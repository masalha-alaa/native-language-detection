Austria was already a dictatorship when Hitler took over, the Nazis killed even the dictator which established it during a failed coup
Plot twist even the dictatorship was right wing it was very clerical and hated the Nazis, even got Mussolini alliance at first to guarantee Austrian independence
And let's not forget that there is party in our government which had the portrait of said dictator hanging in it's central [till recently] (hint: It's not the FPÖ this time)
And let's not forget that there is party in our government which had his portrait hanging in it's central [till recently] (hint: It's not the FPÖ this time)
> It became a tradition among some people here to bring in West Sahara children over for summer holidays every year
In my girlfriend's very very abertzale village a lot of people do that
They also have a bunch of Sahrawi families who live there for good
Some of the kids speak Arabic and Basque, but barely Spanish, which is funny
Interesting, I thought this came from the British school of thinking with Darwin being one of the first coming up with the basic ideas
We have that too, Switzerland also
It's necessary to keep the neutral status
Well the alliance lasted longer than Dollfuss
the opposition was already crushed when Anschluss happend
Wieso hab ich davon noch nie was gehört
Das ist ja verrückt
honestly many austrians wouldn't have recognized the austrofacist eagle anyways
this still isn't really a topic that is talked about intensively in schools (probably partly because the successor party of the austrofacists still is the most powerful in the country)
No it's not
Yeah I think Schuschnigg was a hard smoker and legend has it that Hitler once once inveted him to negotiations in the Berghof, where smoking was prohibited
The negotiations took very long, which led to Schuschnigg becoming very nervous because he wanted to smoke, while Hitler stayed calm, and actually had factored that in
I hope I'm not mixing anything up here, maybe it wasn't Schuschnigg
Pressure from the great powers to decolonize
But the west sahara had its own problems already with morroco trying to take it over while the locals rejected that
Wouldn't the surgery render the person infertile anyway
Just seems wholly unnecessary, even if you wanted to sterilize transsexuals
Or if you have "sketchy" neigbours
No Wonder Finland, Norway, Estonia and Greece have it
taking over Austria was the only logical step
Weil der Austrofaschismus – im Gegensatz zur NS-Zeit – ein nach wie vor politisch umzanktes Tabuthema ist
Es ist nicht immer 100%ig klar wer da jetzt "die Bösen" sind auf die man mit dem Finger zeigen kann und das macht es oft schwierig
Wie viele NS-Gedenkfeiern gibt es, wie oft hört man öffentliche Personen sich an die NS-Zeit erinnern
Da weiß man *wie* man drüber sprechen kann
Wie oft dagegen passiert das mit der Dollfuß-Schuschnigg-Zeit
Ist viel schwieriger, weil sich sofort jemand auf den Schlips gtreten fühlt
Politisch umzankt ist es im Sinne von, wie man die Zeit bewertet
Das fängt an wie man die Zeit bezeichnet
Ständestaat
Austro-Faschismus
Österreichischer Faschismus (die Kompromisslösung schlechthin)
Bundesstaat Österreich
Viele Konservative (*ahem* CV *ahem*) halten Dollfuß für einen Österreich-Patrioten, ja Märtyrer (wurde ja von Nazis ermordet), der sich dem deutschen NS-Einfluss und dem Anschluss zu erwehren versucht hat
"Weil ohne Faschismus wären wir ja gleich von den Nazis überrannt worden, oder wir wären unter den Roten eine Sowjetrepublik geworden
Die Diktatur war der einzige Ausweg um unser Land zu beschützen
", ist da ein (nicht ganz richtiges) Argument, das ich schon sehr oft gehört habe
Viele Rote sehen in ihm einen Arbeitermörder und klerikal-faschistischen autoritären Diktator, der das Rad der Zeit am liebsten um 150 Jahre zurückgedreht hätte, der politische Gegner über paramilitärische Milizen verfolgen ließ, Frauen zurück an den Herd verbannen wollte, der kath
Kirche enormen Einflus zusprach und der daneben auch noch ein ordentlicher Antisemit und Antiziganist war (was oft vergessen wird)
Die heutigen Parteien ÖVP und SPÖ waren in den 50ern ja personell nahtlose Fortsetzungen der Zwischenkriegs-SPÖ bzw
der Zwischenkriegs-Christlichsozialen=Vaterländische Front
Die Nazis haben die eingefleischten (d.h. nicht übergelaufenen) Anhänger beider Parteien später gnadenlos verfolgt und in KZs gesteckt
Man hat halt nach den Nazis gesagt "Lasst uns das Kriegsbeil begraben und das ganze Thema noch dazu, arbeiten wir zusammen und reden nie wieder über diese Zeit
" So kommts dann zu solchen verrückten Geschichten und nach wie vor andauernder Dollfuß-Verehrung (oder zumindest kritikloser Mythenbildung) innerhalb der ÖVP
Most people would think it's an imperial eagle, as it is very similar
Yes, what I meant is, everybody there speaks Basque 95% of the time
My gf's cousins like to half-joke that I know better Spanish than them
I definitely use Spanish in my day-to-day more often than they do
Interesting, thanks for that
Man hat einfach im KZ erkannt, dass die Blutfeindschaft zwischen den Parteien zu einer unerträglichen Zuspitzung der Lage geführt hat
Die Politiker in Österreich sind erst in dieser Not wirkliche Demokraten geworden
Für die SdAP war der Marxismus in der ersten Republik auch wichtiger als die Demokratie
Daher auch die Paranoia der CSP
Umgekehrt natürlich genauso
Nach dem Krieg, und das muss man beiden Parteien hoch anrechnen, haben sie sich dann gemeinsam gegen die Besatzung gestellt
Besonders dass die SPÖ die Weitsicht hatte, sich nicht an die KPÖ anzunähern, hat uns da vermutlich den stalinistischen Terror und eine Teilung des Staates wie in Deutschland erspart
Das ganze hatte sich die KPÖ auch selbst zuzuschreiben
Während SdAP uns CSP/VF Politiker trotz aller Differenzen im KZ zusammenstanden, hat die KPÖ allen Kontakt und allen Zusammenhalt verweigert
Da haben die SdAP Politiker wohl auch die Verachtung der Kommunisten auf die Sozialdemokratie mit voller Härte realisiert
War halt ne ziemlich beschissene Zeit für alle in nem Staat der einen großteil seines Landes und seiner Macht verloren hatte
Während die Sozis Stalins Schwanz gelutscht haben und allen eine Utopie versprachen gingen in der Sowjetunion gerade die Säuberungen los
Hat natürlich die Schwarzen nicht kalt gelassen und die haben sich genauso radikalisiert und mit Mussolini Stellung bezogen
Beide scheiße aber beide im angesicht der Situation mehr oder weniger unausweichlich
Der Bürgerkrieg und die Diktatur war eh abzusehen
The fascist flag had a cross similar to the iron cross on it
[They are not] as they are not crossed
You have to see the tools as part of a trio with the (also golden) mural crown, which turns it into a very strong republican symbol
Together they represent the three parts of society that (in the mind of someone born in the 19th century) make up the republic: Farmers, workers, and burghers
This emphasis on republicanism was a big deal in 1919, when this CoA was made
Because Austrians had just gotten rid of the Habsburger, after almost 800 years, so being a republic was a big deal
However (and most Austrians don't realize this either) the colors of the CoA are black (eagle), red (tongue), and gold (the "trio", the beak and the fangs), which is a hint to the [traditional pan-German colors] (i.e. Germany including Austria), which also have a strong republican connotation – opposed to the Prussian-dynastic black-white-red
The broken chains were added after WWII and signify overcoming fascism
In Austria nobody really thinks the hammer and sickle in our CoA have to do anything with communism, so it's not really an issue either
It's kinda comparable with the fasces in the national emblem of France, which – here – also isn't a fascist symbol, but a republican one
I think they are supposed to represent the different classes in the country
A crown for aristocracy, a hammer for workers and a sickle for farmers
The eagle was adopted from the austrian empire which in turn had taken it from the romans
Okay
Yeah that's right
I did not know that and it's fucked up
When did that happen
> Der Bürgerkrieg und die Diktatur war eh abzusehen
Haha
Ja, fast 100 Jahre später kann man das natürlich mal so lässig behaupten goi
You mean the [Kruckenkreuzflagge] (which was a co-offical flag, next to the regular red-white-red)
I think the above user is referring to the double headed eagle Coat of Arms of the Austrofascist state, [which can be seen on top of the Austrian flag in the English Wikipedia] But afaik that was never an official flag
*Maybe* it was used like the [Bundesdienstflagge] is used today, but that is speculation on my part
> A crown for aristocracy
The *mural* crown (Mauerkrone, kleiner aber wichtiger Unterschied) is for the burghers
The aristocracy was stripped of all its privileges and titles in the new republic
Which is why noble titles are officially banned in Austria still today
Naja ist eben in vielen Ländern der Welt zu der Zeit ähnlich abgelaufen, beide Seiten haben sich polarisiert bis es dann zur Entladung kam z.B in  Spanien
It was actually a very good question, not dumb at all
Also no such thing as a dumb question, it's the purpose of the sub after all
Since I don't bear any ill will towards any EU country, the boring but logical choice to minimize casualties is ~~Luxemburg~~ Malta
The fact I forgot Malta even exists illustrates why it is an even better choice
Though population wise, there isn't that big of a difference between the two countries
Slovenia, so we'll finally break from the landlock
^^^^butseriouslyIloveSlovenia
So **that's** why the UK wanted to leave
I would say Slovenia -> sea access :D
Slovenia would give Austria and Hungary sea access, and Croatia some additional coast
Because Croatia can't have enough coastline
The Netherlands becaise they know that they'd swim in the future
Just hope everyone survives
A lake instead of Luxembourg which reaches to Switzerland
Do you want to get rid of the Alsace too
Don‘t tell me it‘s only to prevent the Germans from occupying it
Flood Slovenia and let that Austrians handle it
Russia would also work
Care to explain your reason
In simple terms if possible so unenlightened non-German minds can understand
Yeah, this
I’d move to Bavaria and have the water right there
But the alps, dude
Like, more often than not I get why you'd off the people, but think of those majestic peaks
Brave words for someone in crusading distance
By that logic I could have picked any of the dwarf countries, but no matter how intertwined, they aren't EU members
Also, unlike you Northern heathens I actually don't want the Vatican gone
Crying because they're not in the EU and therefore exempt from deletion
But
Pasta, my dude
_Sigh
_ Can't even blame you
Seriously the Great Lakes are so gorgeous, I wouldn't mind having those right outside my window hah
Looking at the Moldau towards Krumlov I assume you'll be fine
Well, as per the criteria laid out by OP, Vatican is cheating
>and with no children as citizens
That we know of
The Vatican cellars are sealed for a reason
'tis decided then
In Austria you get a double salary twice a year
Once in the summer and once around Christmas
Presumed consent makes a lot more sense
We have that since 1980 I believe
I don’t know the exact law, but in Austria companies pay a yearly fine if they don’t have a certain percentage of disabled employees
I think it is one disabled person per 25 employees
However, the fine is so inconsequential that the last two companies I worked at just paid the fine
According to this [website by the austrian government] there was a suggestion of the European council 1978 so apparently we were quite early
very atypical for my country :)
Even tho video games are obv art
Too sad not really any country recognises that
Felt so unnecessarely extra playing the austrian/german version of kino der toten with all the swastikas removed
Like who are they doing this for
Well atleast Brexit is gonna move forward now, and the EU can deal with more important issues than the Brits
He looks like a second Trump
Im about as much a fan of Boris Johnson then i am a fan of Trump
both should sit in prision
one for fucking a pug and another for selling out his country to the highest bitter
I really don't care
Uk continues to fuck itself
Hopefully he can finally make their brexit dream a reality and we can move on from them having such a big impact on the EU to a lesser impact
Declaring war on Serbia in 1914 proved quite the "bruh moment" in retrospect
Drunk attacking our own army
Well
We had some
Which one do you want to hear
Declaring neutrality is one thing
Austria and Prussia changed sides

A true albanian
Why would you lie about something so embarrassing though
When I was younger I was kinda naive
I thought one of my friends family was poor
They have a nice/average house but only an old car and only went on a budget holiday every few years
Also they never went to a shopping mall which was odd for me
Nowadays I know that I was just in a middle class bubble in the countryside where I've never seen real poverty
I personally consider somebody poor who lives in tiny flat, can't go on holiday and struggles affording small things like a cinema-visit, comfortable shoes, barber, etc
This is something I have to blame myself too for
I am definitely raised in middle class (Dad working in a high rank in government (Hofrat)) environment
Not rich but we are talking about a salary of about 5000-6000€/month (or the equivalent in Schilling, even though my Dad never disclosed how much he earned to me or my sister), but still pretty high above average and always enough to go on vacation once a year, that I had a (used) car when I turned 18 and stuff like this
And I didn´t realize back then that this is NOT something that is normal
I remember that I wanted to go to the gym and my parents paid for a years membership and I didn´t think much about it
I would have wanted my best friend (whose parents were not that well off, but also not poor neither) to join me there but he couldn´t afford it
It took me many years to realize that I was totally ignorant back then and how spoiled I have been
I did learn my lesson though (later in life)
Just one dish explains it: Deep fried Mars bars
Yes
I think it has something to do with convenience, sometimes the English expression is just so much simpler than the German one (big surprise, i know) that i tend to use it more, simply out of laziness
Also when i've been abroad for a few weeks time it has happened that i completely blank out on some German expressions altogether, standing there looking for what i wanted to say like someone learning the language from new
That feels
odd
Well I sometimes even think in english and then can't remember simple words in my own Language
Right now, I use english more than german
I’m barely on any german site or social media, so I don’t write in german often and at this point I understand english better than my native language
I regularly forget german words too
I often also just say „Fuck it“ and use Denglisch when I‘m lazy enough (Denglisch = German and English at the same time [my german-speakers please don’t kill me])
My friends don‘t really care, except some that say they can „speak really good in english“ and afterwards don‘t understand a single word I use, but then I just explain what I mean and sometimes they tell me the word I‘m looking for
It's gone so far that I often forget normal words in my native language in casual conversation while knowing exactly what I want to say in English
I don't notice it much nowadays, but I remember a time when I would think of something and had serious troubles expressing myself, because there was either no good expression in German, or I couldn't finish a train of thought in German the same way I could in English
Yeah, my vocabulary is more limited in german and I forget words pretty often
The stereotypical one
No, and to be honest I barely like any English accent
Like, not even the British accent sounds weird to me, but that‘s probably because I‘m so used to hearing/speaking American English
It‘s probably also the reason why I practiced my English so much to the point where I barely have an accent/have the American Accent
However, if I e.g. have to pronounce a brand name out of nowhere I might have an accent for a short period of time and I hate that one
That‘s why I avoid pronouncing certain brand names if I spoke German for a long period of time prior
I think it's because it reminds us of our bad classmates who it always took 10 minutes to finish reading one paragraph aloud
I think my accent isn't all that noticeable
At least that's what native speaking friends as well as my teacher told me
And the native speaker
They said I sounded like a posh English kid from Cambridge
My teacher once joked that with that accent I would get beat up by angry and drunk Scotsmen if I ever were to visit some of the more dingy pub's in some parts of England
Good times
I am the only one of my friends having an iPhone and I am kind of getting teased about it bc at least on the countryside it‘s somehow considered as a phone for
-wannabe teenage influencer girls
-people who buy tech stuff for the looks
-people with an attitude
-people with low self esteem
-also some people consider it as gay if a boy has an iPhone (It‘s Austria, people are conservative in a really weird way)
I personally just don't like Apple and I think that brand is quite unpopular here anyway not only when it comes to phones
Macs are not that common
Since most people got Windows it's easier to have windows yourself and it becomes the quasi-standard
iPhones work really well together with Macs and the whole Apple ecosystem
Since hardly anyone is using Macs that whole reason of getting an iPhone isn't there
I know some people in Austria who have iPhones and their main reason is because they are using Macs
Apple never reached the kind of market penetration it has in the US
Some of its services that made it popular in the US are not offered or relevant here, or there just never was a good enough *reason* to switch away from Windows/Android
Competition by cheaper manufacturers from China is strong, capturing the "I don't care I just want a cheap phone to call my grand kids" crowd
iPhones are more expensive and luxurious in design and marketing, and while that can be seen as an advantage, one shouldn't forget that there's a decidedly anti-consumerist streak in Austrian culture
I'd say that among some groups, flounting your material wealth is kind of looked down upon, while going the hipster/eco-friendly/beige jute bag route is seen as more favorable (among educated people)
For these people, not owning a car and having a small, old and "sensible" phone is preferable to the "white and gold" of Apple products
I can only really comment on younger people with a university education here, but among those, white iPhones, Gucci bling and Luis Vuitton bags is definitely looked down upon as a class identifier, and seen as only being liked by working class Turkish immigrant kids, chavs and gopnis, maybe those who didn't go to university and started working right away when the were 20, and "basic" people (Tussis, basically those who study law or economy and who party at posh inner district clubs instead of at raves, festivals or more alternative clubs)
I think it's less that and more that the us has a culture of frivolous spending (seen also in those huge weddings for example) and necessity for status symbols, and the iPhone is incredibly attainable for that purpose, unlike a huge wedding/house/car, and you can show it off to others all the time
Hah
Especially the more technological affinity the people judging you have (looking at you, HTLs)
Just wanted to say that from one schnitzel to another
> some people consider it as gay if a boy has an iPhone
What
And even if, so what
Imagine using gay as an insult in the year two thousand and twenty (2020)
What kind of idiot would say that
Du schwuchtel host a iPhone
Geh schleicht di
>-also some people consider it as gay if a boy has an iPhone (It‘s Austria, people are conservative in a really weird way)
The fuck
I haven't been a teenager for the better part of two decades but, again, what
Also yeah kids are stupid and break their stuff all the time so they have no business having a 1000€ iPhone
Much more fiscally responsible to get them a 200€ phone every year when they've shattered their screen
You're making it sound like there aren't any alternatives to apple products (itunes was discontinued a while ago, btw)
You can use Spotify and google maps etc
without any problems on apple devices
I'm listening to Spotify right now, never felt like bothering with Apple Music
Didn't have any problems connecting my non-apple speakers to my apple devices either
You‘re 100% right
Thanks for the input, fellow schnitzel
100% went to HTL
Every Iphone user was seen as a tech illiterate just for having one
Totally agree
Interesting
I commented on it [above] but I think over here it's actually -3 charisma
I mean if you buy some rather unknown brand or brand known for building cheap phones then yes
But I don't see a difference in that regard between a Samsung phone or an iPhone
You know what you are getting with a Samsung Phone
It's strange to view actual choice as a negative thing
Exactly
I always wondered about this, and this thinking does not only exist in the US - if anything I will think more of you if you obtained a good phone for minimum price and didn't throw it all out for sleek design
Ugh, it's a stuttery slow mess
And those bubbles
So glad over here it's WhatsApp, the UI is way better imho
Have the 6T and it Works like a charm
It's a nice size and not heavy at all
The design is nice and the phone is bug free since i bought it on its release
Wels has a far-right major and problems with ethnic communities
It's such a mis-managed city
But apart from that
Hard to say
We have a saying: "Wien ist anders" that literally translates to "Vienna is different"
There is a map of austria showing which parts of austria hate vienna, everything except vienna is white, which stands for hating vienna, and vienna is red, which also stands for hating vienna
I think St
pölten, BC it looks like the death star of star wars
People rant on St
Pölten, but other than being small for being the capital of the largest state, I don't see any problems with it
I completely forgot Wels existed
And I live 25km away from it
I was scanning the comments fearing someone would mention Linz (Linz may be very industrial, but it ain't that bad), or Vienna (which would be the typical anti-capital reflex; Vienna is fantastic)
Now that I see that Wels is being mentioned I'm content, because I would have said the same thing
Wels is ugly, soulless and irrelevant
I looks like *hingschlazt* along the Traun, completely pointless
And their mayor is a disgusting piece of shit
I hate it
When my dad was there they charged him 8€ for an Espresso
Pissed him off so much he stole the cup :D
Dragging down the GDP of the country would be ridiculous
You mean GDP per capita
Im from Freistadt lol
Its just that the rest of austria is more rural and even in the next biggest cities the people are a lot closer so the big city feels a bit distant from the rest
That combined with clichés of the people there not being able to drive properly makes us hate them(not all that seriously tho)
"Scheiß weana
Yeah, i know its pretty nice, but the rest of austria kinda looks down on it(some more jokingly some more seriously)
Dunno, I'd have to ask him
Thing is, he even speaks some half-decent Italian, so he isn't too touristy of a tourist
Still GDP per capita
Just the basic „Sorry, traffic jam“ or „Sorry, bus was late“ is usually the main excuse -we don‘t usually give reasons for running late, we just say „sorry, am late“ and that was pretty much it-
If that wears off, try "Got stuck on an escalator" instead
The guy who got completely wasted at the last Christmas party
I think that writing classical music was just a way for Austrians to look busy while procrastinating
We'd be the room between the western and eastern wing of the building
MA2412 wasnt too far off i guess lol
Wouldn´t it be more like the food truck across the street that EVERY employee just loves to go to and that then somehow thinks that he is working for the company too, because one tire of the food truck is actually on the company parking lot

My one favorite series is from America, the other from the UK
Besides I easily get confused by little things like fish n' chips
What are the chips now
Potatoes, fries or actually chips
Definitely
Absolutely, for spelling I use whatever seems more logical to me
* so an s if the question is s/z but the sound is s.
* The "correct" order of letters for words like "meter"
* no silent u-s, so it's color etc
And generally any expression I have picked up somewhere is fair game for me
Recently watched some austrialian and canadian tv-shows --> come into the mix
If I should ever move to an english-speaking country I would try to speak and write their version of the language, but as long as I am not why should I try to limit myself
Definitely
Also most books I read where us but most subtles I read where UK
So I just happily mix
The sheer amount of advertising and open display of patriotism felt very odd to me
Carpet floors in public buildings/offices
It's pretty disgusting
Carpet floors in general is something I don't get, but even at home some people keep their shoes on
while having carpet floors
Sizes of beverages/food
It's ridiculous
No wonder a large portion of the population is fat
They are already big in Austria (which is a reason why we are also fat) but it is no comparison
Also complete strangers talking to you
In NYC, where people are supposed to be the unfriendliest in the whole US
chlorine in tap water
That there seemed to be no normal restaurants like we have in Europe
It was either fast food or an expensive restaurant where you have to make a reservation
I'd say the urinal etiquette is the same in Austria, unless there's like a queue already waiting
It's funny, I feel the same way about every German I meet
I always thought, I had micro-balls when I heard about that stuff from Americans
In elementary school: Frau Lehrerin/Herr Lehrer
In middle school: Frau Fachlerer(in)/Herr Fachlehrer
In high school: Frau Professor/Herr Professor
All of them more or less meaning "Mr
/Mrs
teacher". Anything else would be super weird or rude
actually it's just a ln intercultural misunderstanding
for the huge amount of friendliness we expect very deep and long-lasting interest and a meaningful relationship
when we get fleeting interest and a noncommittal relationship instead, we can't help but feel "betrayed". you on the other hand find us stand-offish at first and then often surprisingly not as grumpy as you expected us to be, because the relationship level "just strangers having a chat" warrants much higher display of friendliness than we are prepared to give, but that changes more than you would expect it to
playing sounds of loudly flushing actually to mask for he sound of farts and actual shitting
Honestly I have the same problem, I'm often too nervous to say anything, so I usually hand them a sandwich without saying anything & when they thank me I just say "no problem" or wish them a good day
If they're not hungry at the moment they most probably will be in a couple of hours, so they will accept the food no matter what
Totally normal in Austria, nothing medieval about it
The conservatives get a authoritarian boner about the possibilities shown to them by Covid Contact tracking
Luckily nothing really (except some people in the government wanting to make a tracking app for Corona mandatory, but they seemingly changed their minds on it now), but I think with another FPÖ-ÖVP Government this would probably different
Didn't they even create an app where you can "anonimously" track your contact with other people
I saw the ad on TV
Certainly not using that
I don't trust them, they could certainly find some excuse to access that data
After all this is an emergency situation
Yeah, I simply don't trust them to press delete on that data afterwards
Could also be worse tho
I always liked the fact their abbreviation is what it is
Love it
Wilhelm (male), Ludmilla (female)
I think "Gottfrieda" is a pretty old one
"Brunhilde", I don't even know someone of that name
More common old-fashioned names would be "Fritz", "Franz", "Hans", ...
Definetly Josef for the boys and maybie Maria for the girls
Adolf somehow fell out of favour and Theodor or Alois is not so common anymore
For females I guess something like Margarete oder Gisela
Hildegard, Hagen, Hildebrand
There's also plenty of non-Germanic old-timey names
Like Ignaz, Matthäus, Genoveva, or Alma
There was a real life version of this in a cutre reality show on German TV
[A mother of 9 calling her kids to come down into the kitchen]
Silvana, Serafina, Estefania, Kilenta (?), Loredana (?), Gabriel/Fabienne (??), Lavinia (????), Jeremy, Pascal

We do have  [Edeltraud] (Edel = noble, traud = strength ) and  [Engelbert] (Engel =  [Angle] bert = shiny, famous)
which seem rather similar to Æthelbert
\[googles around\]
Apparently Æthelbert became Adalbert after the Norman conquest and it's Old High German (Adal = noble, bert = shiny, famous) in origin
Mine too, even in Austria
That's probably because I'm a man though
2050 is too late
"2050" is a code for "some point in the future which is far away enough so that I have to do diddly-squat during *my* term of office and after me the deluge
I love cars but I'm still not sad, it's going to be fine I'm sure
Alsatian obviously, duh
When I’m writing a long text, it sometimes happens that I can’t remember a word in my native tongue but I know what I want to say in English, so I have to translate the English word into my own language
Not exactly but sometimes when I hear/read something in English (I am Austrian) it takes me a few seconds to realize that it’s not German
I remember a scenario from yesterday:
So Austrian-German has many words that are different from German-German but are for the same things
So we have those words, but we still have to learn the standard-german version
So yesterday in german class we got a list with a few of those words and should translate every single one of them to standard-german and funnily enough, I could translate every single one of them to english but barely one of them to german
It doesn't sound like gibberish, but sometimes I can only think of the English version of a word or expression - in the middle of a german sentence
I always get everything mixed up when it comes to English and German
Words, pronounciation, grammar, literally everything you can mess up
Word order is one of the issues for me but not the biggest one at all
The name thing doesn’t happen to me at all
My mother told me to pronounce my name in English but I ignored her because my name sounds horrible in English and I couldn’t even really pronounce it if I wanted to
The word Austria is from proto-germanic
Austar meaning east and the latin word Austri meaning south
Overall, Austria can be translated as *The Mythical Dwarf Of The East
* The german name, Österreich, can be translated as Eastern Realm
Our flag, red-white-red, is said to be from the 11th century
Duke leopold came back from war and his white coat was drenched in the opponents blood, meaning he succeeded
He took off his scabbard and you could see a white line
It was the only place on his entire coat that wasn‘t red
The oldest zoo in the world is [Tiergarten Schönbrunn in Vienna] The first steps of an attempt of a zoo dating back to 1452 and the name Schönbrunn first shown on documents from 1642
The „birthday of the zoo“ is said to be July 31st 1752, when Emperor Franz Joseph I. Stephan first allowed friends and other visitors to go into the zoo
(Also short extra fact: Schönbrunn is one of the ten zoos in Europe that are allowed to have pandas
The panda baby Fu Long („Happy Dragon“) was the first panda baby in Europe to be bred naturally and be born in that very same zoo
[August 2007])
It‘s hard to count how many nobel prizes we have as a country, since the people that got them either had dual-citizenship when they got it or weren’t a citizen anymore
So we have either 18 or 31 nobel prizes as a country
We cherish our culture
If you‘re in Austria and see a festival where people wear traditional clothing like Dirndl or Steireranzüge, then those aren‘t paid actors
Those are normal people that just wore it
It also isn‘t considered abnormal to just run around in a Dirndl through Downtown
Well, you barely see it when there isn‘t a festival around, but people probably won‘t think you’re bonkers if you do it
Also, it‘s considered formal wear and you can get into many balls wearing it
You can honestly wear it almost anywhere, it‘s that weird thing between formal clothing but not formal enough to be considered weird if you wear it on a normal day
//////Also Styria is the federal state that has the most festivals about Austrian culture
Edit: spelling
According to legend, the Austrian flag is based on a blood soaked piece of cloth
Either way it is very old, having been in use in some way since at least the 13th century
The University of Vienna is the largest University in the German speaking region, with over 90
000 students
It is also the oldest, unless you count Prague which is no longer part of that region/category
Every democratic election in Vienna, the capital, since 1919 has been won by the same party
(Currently called the Socialdemocratic Party, the name changed a bit over time)
The "Allgemeine Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch" (General Civil Law Book
), first written in 1811, is almost(?) in its entirety still in use unchanged
I think it's where the civil/base rights are constitutionally noted, but I might be wrong on that, it's been a while
The "youngest" Austrian state is (probably
) Burgenland
It's the eastern most state and was part of Hungary until 1920/21
Vienna was first made its own state around the same time, in 1920
Austria:
Austria plays an important role as a kind of negotiator between east and west (especially in the cold war) because of our neutrality
To this day many important negotiations are held in vienna, like just recently represantatives of russia and the usa met in vienna to discuss a contract from the cold war which restricts the number of nuclear weapons in these countries
After the second world war Austria lost almost 90% of its Area and more than 80% of it's population
Since before 1918 it was Austria-Hungary which consisted of several other states as well like the czech republic and slovakia
Although Austria only has about 8
9 million citizens, many important and well known people are from Austria, people like Mozart, Falco, Niki Lauda, Arnold Schwarzenegger
Or others like Wolfgang Pauli, Erwin Schrödinger or Sigmund Freud
Austria is the only country in the world, where alpine skiing is considered a national sport
My country might not have been the most succesful one in wars
Still Austria gained much land in our history (for example there was a time the sun didn't set in Austria when spain and mexico belonged to us) due to their marriage policy
There was this motto "tu felix austria nube" which means something like: you happy austria, marry
Liechtenstein would like to have a word
> Also, it‘s considered formal wear and you can get into many balls wearing it
You can honestly wear it almost anywhere, it‘s that weird thing between formal clothing but not formal enough to be considered weird if you wear it on a normal day
To clarify: This doesn't mean it's a suitable replacement for a suit or dress
Unless everyone does it, you'd look whack as hell at a funeral
Generally, traditional clothing like Lederhosen and Dirndl are primarily worn to social events
Nobody wears them daily or for work
Unless the work requires it - plenty of inns, especially in rural areas will try to keep that look
I'm led to believe that you're from Styria, it might be the case that y'all wear them more often than we do
I‘ve been to Hvar once, can absolutely confirm the sunny part
got my life burnt out of me
Guessed it, I am from Styria
:D And yeah, maybe we do wear Dirndls and Steieranzüge/Lederhosen more often than other federal states (even though I refuse to believe that Salzburg or Tyrol isn‘t up there with us), but I think they aren‘t that unusual to be seen wearing in other federal states (Vienna maybe, but I personally have seen some people just go around with it in the city
I gotta say tho, I'm a big fan of wearing Lederhosen to any occasion (except stuff like funerals)
So comfy
[German version of wikipedia, name austria, not available in other languages for me]
> Die Bezeichnung geht jedoch nicht auf die lateinische, sondern auf die urgermanische Sprache zurück
Das althochdeutsche *austar- bedeutet soviel wie „östlich“ oder „im Osten“, und die altisländische Edda nennt den mythischen Zwerg des Ostens Austri
Eng mit dem Wort Austria verwandt sind auch die Namen Austrasien und Austrien für das Ostfrankenreich bzw
Ostreich
Auch in der älteren Bezeichnung Ostarrîchi ist die Wurzel ôstar- erkennbar
Die Ähnlichkeit mit dem lateinischen Auster für „Südwind“ und terra australis für das „Südland“ Australien ist zufällig
Translation:
> The name isn‘t rooted to the latin form, but to the proto-germanic language
The old german version *austar- meaning „eastern“ or „in the East“, and the old icelandic Edda calls the mythical dwarf of the east Austri
Closely related to the word Austria are the names Austrasien and Austrien for Eastfrance aka Eastrealm
Also in the old meaning Ostarrîchi is the root ôstar- present
The latin Auster for Southern land and terra australis for „Southern land“ Australia is a coincidence
Those Grand Duchies always thinking they're better than Principalities
Ts ts ts
The more rural an area gets, the more often you will see them
Along the more urban Danube, you see them less and less
Can't even recall the last time I saw someone with it, but that doesn't mean all that much, since it's not really noteworthy either
If there's people going out, though, chances are high that you run into someone rocking a Tracht or Dirndl
Someone just strolling around the Landstraße in Linz or the Mariahilfer Straße in Vienna is most likely not wearing it
There will be the odd one out once in a while, but it's rare
The only one left, Tuscany used to be one too
That would a very good idea be
I can me imagine, that regularly to do
I think I will that even in the future do
As you see, in German have we a very different structuring of sentences, which of course very difficult to read be can
Edit: I just sound like Yoda honestly
I know not, if I that can
It is pretty difficult, even though german english very similar is
Our grammar is very confusing, even for native speakers
But, just from grammar, are some sentences the english ones pretty similar
————
Today had I a math exam
It wasn‘t difficult, but I was really nervous
Otherwise was my day really nice
Right now driving I with the bus home
When I at home want I sleep
Am I glad, that I next week holiday have
I can't even like that write
the german cases would something against have
Unpopular opinion: if we manage to qualify for our first world cup since 1998 I definitely want us to play
>I pledged to boycot the thing years ago when rumours about 400 dead workers (slaves
) reached me which died building the stadiums
(now casualties go into thousands)
It's more, this article says 6500 died so far
Feel ya
> I nominate Switzerland
Switzerland is already seat of all those highly corrupt organizations hosting those events
FIFA and the IOC both have their HQ in Switzerland
Both organizations are highly corrupt deep into their cores
As we say here: "the fish starts stinking at the head"
> Hell, there could be a permanent "International Olympic Village"
That idea I *do* like
A non-stop fuck fest basically
I think it’s more complicated then it seems at first
The reason those countries are excluded from the ESTA program is that they have a higher then 3% Visa refusal rate - mostly due to the risk of overstaying in the US (so basisally the risk of illegal immigration)
Now the reason for this risk is economic mainly - as such countries like Croatia and Poland will soon be included into the ESTA program (they have a refusal rate of around 5%) while Bulgaria and Romania have around 11-15%
The thing is - it’s not an arbitrary decision
If the EU would be one country (which it isnt) those parts would also enjoy visa free travel to the US - for now I do understand the decision though
Since it’s not based on „we don’t like you“ aka feelings but hard numbers which can be traced back and verified
I mean, they have the esta or what it's called for ages now which is basically a visa anyway (potato, ) so they are not upholding their part for the whole EU anyway, and I'd love for the EU to finally do something about it (apparently we're going to introduce an esta for Americans too, but that's just stopping to their level instead of having visa free travel for real)
Spent 2h waiting in Atlanta this year
They didn't even let non-american flights queue up for immigration lines: "US citizens only" they said, unable to respond to my "how long do we have to wait" question
When they were done with US citizens, they closed all counters except for 4
I loved standing in line for another hour due to that
It reminded me of all the reasons I cannot stand travelling there to begin with
Interesting thought to be honest - but I guess that would fall under sexism and thus can’t really be applied in this case
That’s not my point at all - If you’d ask me I think that all of the EU should be treated as one block for visa purposes cause then the visa refusal rate would be far below 3%.
The problem with this is though that recirprocity in Visa questions is not the strong suit of the EU - while I can travel to South Africa visa free for 90 days, South African citizens need a visa
So there are already quite well established cases in which the EU treats citizens of countries that offer visa free entry worse then EU citizens get treated by them
And this is the one case in which some EU citizens are excluded
If this should be the case between the two richtest political entities in the world is another question
The problem the US also has is that it doesn’t have an internal registration system - once you are in you are in
They don’t even have exit controls to check if you overstayed
And now you won’t even have the economic benefits
So much winning
Not really - cause you do apply it to all people
The problem is that the EU is not one country
In which case you would be right - that would be like saying “people from Bavaria can apply to ESTA - people from Berlin can’t”
But here they are saying that in the country of Croatia, x people get denied, and as such the country of Croatia won’t get access to ESTA
Other examples - for whatever reason Croatian nationals need a visa to Thailand and won’t get a VOA as the other 27 citizens of EU member states
Same for slovakians to South Africa
So as long as the EU doesn’t constitute itself as one country, with a unified immigration and visa policy (if you get a Croatian  visa you can’t  enter Schengen for example and to enter Croatia you need a multiple Schengen Visa not a single entry one ) the single states will continue to be looked at as single countries - and not as a member of a bigger whole - like the federal states of Germany of the USA
Well Brexit is a crazy shit show (that will hurt the British a lot more then they think) and trump is a complete imbecile
What do you expect ? Europe has to find positions on those two things - and since the UK as well as the US are on completely divergent paths from what Europe thinks is the future I don’t see how a certain amount of animosity is not to be expected
Well that’s fine then - but why is it a problem then for you that the EU will now give those benefits only to member states and exclude the UK from them ?
Cause I guess that’s what you mean with the claim
That the EU is behaving nationalistic
So far non one has called for an invasion of the UK or an embargo - it’s basically back to status quo ante
And if you are happy with that (which you apparently are) then I don’t see the problem
I don’t think that the people of the US or the UK are the enemy
But I do think that they made choices that are in conflict with the policies of the EU and as such the EU will have to find a way to deal with those choices
And the results of this won’t always be beneficial to UK/US relations with the EU
Don’t get me wrong - but you are basically say that the UK for example made its choice (Brexit) and the EU should just continue as before and if they change anything in the relations with the UK that’s nationalism and jingoism
That’s complete bullshit
What do you mean with hostile rethoric ?
Telling you that you won’t get preferential treatment ?
Telling you that imports / exports will be scrutinized ?
Telling you that the well being of British citizens is an afterthought over the well-being of EU citizens ?
Seriously - what did you expect ?
Business as usual ?
And as for Gibraltar - expect the EU from now on to be on the Spanish side of things - since you guys are not part of the club anymore
No I am not saying that - but if Spain decides to cut off Gibraltar from land access to Spain or decides to not let Gibraltar bound planes use its airspace (remeber no deal Brexit also means no open skies agreement)  - why should it intervene against a member state for a non member state ?
Now it’s “hey you can’t do that - the UK is a member state, so free movement of goods and so on ...” but then ?
You ll be out - no need (and no way) for the EU to force a member state to do something for a non member state
That’s not hostility
That’s just politics
And it was totally clear that it would end like this in the case of Brexit
No that would be hostility - as the UK would interfere in the internal politics of another country - the same as if Spain would help Scotland to gain independence for example (which it doesn’t do)
Gibraltar on the other hand will be non EU territory and thus can be treated as such in any way
It’s basically on the same level as Any other non EU country with no special treatment to be expected
Again : what did you expect ?
And try to find a clear concise answer to that
How should the EU treat the UK and it’s dependencies after Brexit ?
Ah you see but Irish unification is on the table due to the Good Friday agreement
And no member state wants some sort of civil war in or near a member state
And since it involves a member state macron can say something - it will in the end affect all of the EU if we have to deal with the north Irish after all
If handing over Gibraltar ever comes on the table be sure that the rest of the EU will also have an opinion about that
But you still haven’t answered my question - what exactly did you expect from the EU in case of Brexit ?
You still haven’t answered my question :
What did you expect in case of Brexit ?
And as for macron :
He said that “Irish unification would solve Brexit problems - but it’s not up to France”
If you call someone saying “hey there is a problem here that can be solved like this, but in the end it’s up to you” jingoism well - then everything is jingoism as soon as someone dares to say anything that doesn’t fall in line with UK wishes
If he had said “we want Irish unification cause it’s the only solution and we don’t care about the UK at all” well yes then I would agree - but he didn’t.
He basically said “find a solution - even if it’s one that’s out of your comfort zone”
Again - what did you expect ?
Can you answer that ? Or is there noting ?
Why would an independent Britain be in any way interested what Spain does in a purely internal conflict between Catalonia and the Spanish government ?
I hope that you can see the difference between France telling the UK and Ireland to fix a problem cause it will affect a member state and Britain telling Spain to fix a problem In which it has no discernible interest at all
And in fact Johnson had an opinion about the referendum it was (and I quote) : “The Catalonian referendum is a matter for the Spanish govt & people
Imp that Spanish constitution respected & the rule of law upheld
“ so he basically said what I said -> it’s an internal Spanish matter which does not affect anyone else and had to be solved there
The Irish question affects the whole of the EU though
I hope yoh can see the difference (I start to doubt it though)
And again :
What did you expect as the reaction from the EU to the Brexit referendum ? Did you have the hope for preferential treatment ? All at the same ? Just with no freedom of movement ? Where you that oblivious ?
>	The weakening of Spain and the distraction of Spain from Gibraltar via the Catalonian question would absolutely be of British interest in regard to Gibraltar
Of course
That’s so ridiculous even you had to laugh at that argument right ?
>	So Johnson did the exact opposite of what Macron did
How is this contributing to your point
Again - Irland is Part of the EU, France is Part of the EU, as such France is interested in a positive outcome of Brexit for Ireland
Which includes no violence in NI due to the possibility of a hard border between NI and the Republic
You might not like that - but that’s how it is
Johnson on the other hand has no interest other then sow discord in Spain if he supports the Catalonian separatists
If the UK would still be a member of the EU things might be different - but when the referendum was held article 50 was already triggered
And it was clear that the UK would leave
Plus support for Catalonian independence would probably give Scottish independence also rise - and I guess you don’t want that
And are you finally able or willing to Answer my questions ?
Nobody is advocating for the break up of the UK - or for a blockade of Gibraltar
But at the same time - if it’s happening ? Why should the EU care
The food Friday agreement includes the option of a border poll - maybe it is a good time to invoke that and figure out if NI wants to be united with the republic
And no such a clause or agreeing does not exist in Catalonia - so don’t even try to argue with that
And as for Gibraltar ? It’s not of the EUs concern anymore to be honest
Or only as far as it has to be - so if there is again an open sky agreement the EU will force Spain to open its airspace for 1st freedom flights to Gibraltar but if it doesn’t exist ? How should the EU enforce someting that doesn’t exist
Also there is no treaty that says “the land border between Gibraltar and Spain must be open in case of the UK not being part of the EU” - as it doesn’t exist - it can’t be enforced
This is not jingoism - this is just political reality
And the reality is that an unimportant island nation of 60 million can’t make demands to the European Union
Britannia doesn’t rule the seas anymore
Face reality at some point
And no - you still didn’t say what you expect from Brexit - you are just hiding behind pretending that the EU is the big bad wolf who wants to dismantle the UK
I am really interested how you imagine how the EU - UK relations should look like a year or two down the road
I don't know if this counts as stupid or horrible, but here it goes:
Our former Secretary of Interior said that he wants to concentrate Asylum Seekers in camps
He didn't understand why so many people had a problem with that wording
Ex Vice chancellor took a quite incriminating vacation in Ibiza
Isnt the reason for cannabis beeing prohibited that its illegal
Well there's the Ibizia-Video, literally everything in there qualifies
This one is not as stupid but still really dumb: After the 2019 parliamentary election, the leader of the Social Democrats (who just received their worst result in a federal election ever) triumphantly proclaimed that her party is going in the right direction
Have you ever heard about the bsoffene gschicht were politician tried to sell our water and other stuff
Also please look at the toes of this russian oligarch ;)
Austria's present chancellor Sebastian Kurz said:
"If they can't afford to pay rent, they should buy a flat
A candidate for a small, local election had a steam account linked to his email where he played with nicknames as "Heinrich Gaserboy himmler" or "Adolf Hitler", used Himmler as his profile picture and was active in a steam group called Panzer division 57
He claimed some leftists created the account to get him negative press for the election
The account was years old
He also said something about politics being above the law but I can't remember what he said exactly though
Were these state companies relics from the Salazar era
Y'all need to introduce a height requirement for immigration from Austria
He's really short and overcompensates for it constantly
No, but actually he has 4 discontinued university careers (history, philosophy, journalism and political sciences) and he likes horses (instead of German shepherds)
Das Recht muss der Politik folgen (the law must follow politics)
It was at a discussion about denying the status of protection to deliquent/criminal asylum seekers/refugees
It isn't that hard believe when you know what he normal says or does
Also, drunk and stupid added together, always guarantees a good outcome
IIRC there were some vandalism edits on his wikipedia page shortly before they announced the ban, including the cockroach one
So people were like "the real reason surely was the cockroach, not the YPG
Why sell profitable companies
The price doesn't seem to have been worth it
He probably wasn't anything much out of the ordinary
I haven't looked it up, but from memory, he looks average-sized in pictures
It's a classic tactic of defamation against your enemy though, make him seem smaller than he actually is to the point of ridicule
Probably a mixture of both
Aren't they Social Democrats
But weren't they those that profited from the Carmation (?) revolution
It's kinda ironic that there didn't seem to be have been any large-scale corruption scandals under Salazar (at least non that were uncovered after the revolution, which is strange) but after a few years under democratic government the first large corruption scandal happened
>I mean, corruption is inherent to an autocracy / dictatorship, so that's why corruption scandals didn't exist / uncovered, because things simply weren't recorded or if they were, it wouldn't matter
But yeah, embezzlers are also a risk that the people need to watch out for
Corruption is corruption, it doesn't matter if it is within a democracy or autocracy, republic or monarchy
Corruption also isn't invisible, at least in the long term
If there was large scale corruption you would notice it in practical ways like budgets drying up on the way to the ground, construction costs increasing tons over budget, huge nonsensical construction jobs or just loss of tax money before it reaches the treasury
In the case of revolutions corruption generally sees the light of days because old data is found, analysed and published
We see this constantly in regime changes
We see it in Spain with Franco, Latin America, Africa, Russia and even China
In the case of Salazar however there is a stark absence of evidence for corruption linked to him
Ski resorts probably
Honestly, quite a lot of what has happend the last few days was pretty unthinkable a few weeks ago
* Church/Religious service
Cancelled
* Going to work unless it's absolutely necessary
Cancelled
* Ski resorts
Closed (some waaaayy to late, sadly - Sorry, Iceland, Norway, Germany and probably rest of Northern Europe)
* Alpine Skiing World Cup
Cancelled
* Soccer season
Cancelled
* Bars/Restaurants
Closed
* Drafting civil service conscripts (people who didn't want to do military service for moral reasons)
Is already starting to happen
It's quite surreal all this - but at least we all feel like we're doing something
The truly unthinkable thing would be if the trafiken closed and people couldn't buy smokes anymore
I can't imagine it
If it is we'll all be dead before the approval process is through
I heard about it
Both sides are responsible
Especially the that town wich didn't give a damn that they actually are near the Italian border
Unless you live in Tirol
Then walks and hikes are also banned
Unless you have a dog
Aren't the danes uo there with the austrians when it comes to winter sports and skiing
I'm pretty sure that when you compare it to population those two have the best gold metal count for the winter olympics
Yeah, I thought about Norway not Denmark
not really forgetting about it, it’s merely slipping my mind bc I barely have to think about it
what I do admire though, is their low level of racism even though they are all by „themselves“ up there, correct me if i’m wrong
the rest of the european countries, at least I got the impression, developed a relative high level of it over the last couple years, even though they constantly have to deal with neighboring countries, work migration, and so on
one might think, this should sensitivize a population in regard to other nationalities, but it doesn’t.
meanwhile, iceland offers to take in refugees and no one listens
smh
No because Iceland was my favorite country for a long time
If it was up to me I'd make Vienna the connecting station
I think we have a lot more international connections to western Europe than Budapest
As someone else said, I'd be wary of the money being abused but the project itself I'd support
East and southeast Europe needs better train networks
>high speed rail is a staple in Western and increasingly - Central Europe
Good one
It certainly is good for some western cities and probably better than in the east but holy crap could it be better here too
I'm travelling every once in a while between vienna and stuttgart
It wouldn't be impossible to make this rail connection work, and still going by car is cheaper and faster than going by train
So yes, I'm all for improving our high speed rails or really just making some in the first place
As the top poster said, "staple" is wrong
&#x200B;
Not sure if you count Austria to West or Central, but:
there are about 200km between the two largest cities in Austria, the trains takes at least 2:35 => Car usually faster (speed limit on highways is 130 km/h.)
Going further south to Klagenfurt, 135km more, is at least 2:54h more
&#x200B;
There are some rail sections where 200+ km/h is possible, and some are in construction, but still there are many things that can be done
And given the amount of travellers, probably the inner-country rails are more important than a connection to Greece
Any reason why it would specifically be Bulgaria and Greece
In my eyes such a high speed network (which I absolutely support) should evenly connect all countries of the Union
And right now the whole eastern countries are in a really bad shape in that regard
I'm totally in the mentality for taking trains of flights but if trains are a lot more expensive, I need to make multiple changes and it takes like 16h instead of 2h, makes kinda difficult
(You can get a flair on the right; also your username definitely checks out)
Also, the connection Vienna-Triest
There should be old tracks still
But that's an extra train change which in my opinion is one of the most annoying things of travelling
> Because these two have the furthest from being connected
*looks at Finland* are you even for real, mate
Still not something I would consider quality time
I try to but usually I don't find a lot of Austrian comments
Our country is too smol :(
Maybe it's because I'm biased but I do tend to find a lot of Austrian comments
I think we're a little overrepresented (like, more comments than our size suggests) in the European subreddits
For each Austrian commenting there should be like 10 Germans and 8 French people
Then maybe I'm just not looking hard enough lol
Hello little one :3
Yes
And the biggest problem in my opinion is that Africa is often seen as one country, one culture, which has been stated several times by other people in the comments
One of the main reasons (I think) is that besides those ads the only time anyone talks about Africa is when there is something terrible on the news
Even in school the only time the whole continent was talked about was 1) when the "Out of Africa" theory came up in biology class and 2) when history class taught us about colonialism
Which wasn't really helpful because sadly the way that subject was taught was very disappointing
I think what opened my eyes was seeing people like Trevor Noah on YouTube, talking about his country South Africa, while simultaneously starting to look up countries all over the world so I could find rather unusual destinations for travelling
I started to realize that I actually never questioned what I was shown until that point and I see things very differently now
But the way the usual media and even school portrays Africa is basically that: A bunch of starving kids, Ebola, savages, war zones, etc
So since people want to stay away from that nobody even cares to find out more about individual countries
TL;DR: Starving kids, Ebola, war zones, savages - portrayal of Africa in a nutshell here
No education at all, just sad ads for charity
I mean, I personally don't really watch TV, but I think in Austrian media and by Austrian NGOs these ads have been replaced with less stereotype-y ones in the last five years at least
Reminds me a bit of an Austrian film from the early 90s. It's a mockumentary where a group of anthropologists/ethnologists from sub-saharan Africa go to Upper Austria to study the culture and of the natives
It does a pretty great job mimicking the condescending tone many of the real documentaries can't seem to avoid
Funnily Austria has a huge percentage of donations to NGOs by individual people when compared to other European countries
But we all are like "nah Austrians aren't generous at all".
It's called Das Fest des Huhnes (Festival of the Chicken)
Check out [my reply] to Worldgnasher

Not a word, but an idiom: "To give up the ghost

trödeln/herumtrödeln I  guess comes closest
Because Schwarzi just doesn't have the same ring to it
Nope, never have, never will
Last catalogue of a nordic company I got emotional about was the 1990 Lego catalogue
I'll miss it, really
I always kept the most recent issue in the toilet reading shelf
What I find really irritating is people running around in deep winter clothes when it's like 15°C outside
Edit: typo
I miss being able to go skiing on 2m of natural snow
You know what
I received a wish
at ad with christmas stuff in JULY
15°C is the funniest temperature, because some guys will still be wearing shorts and some guys will already wear winter coats lol
I am actually kinda happy that leather jacket time gets longer lol
I'm one of them
Since when are people only allowed to get irritated by stuff that affects them
It looks beautiful for a day and then it just sucks
If you aren't an avid skier there is nothing about snow to like
If you have a house with a yard you will have to shovel every day before work which can mean getting up at 4am, shovel the fucking snow, then take a shower and go to work
Then be stuck in traffic for an eternity because snow causes a chaos on the streets
Then after work shovel snow from your car and be stuck in traffic again
Then come home and shovel your yard again
If you live on a hill or mountain you can add getting stuck in snow every now and then
Its not always that bad of course
But sometimes snow can really really really ruin your day
Heck I know a guy who does that through winter
"Warm" meaning appropriate for north pole expeditions
Because that's quite literally what some people seem to wear
I remember once getting stuck in a one-way street because there was like more than 1m of snow infront of us
Also snow in cities becomes dirty and ugly really fast
You should really check your circulation if that's the case
Don't do sports either, but am always warm from my childhood days
Humans as a apecies are weird
Is Anti-German sentiment still a thing in your country
I am myself mo German, but native German speaker, and I often encountered people who tend to be quite hostile against Germans
Also some Slavic friends of mine, arguing that Germans are oppressive and expansive by nature and very rude, unfriendly and humor-less (I fall out of the scheme according to them) although my experience with Germans is very different and I also know that history is far more complex
But often I met many people who still have the WWII image of Germans although a ton has changed the last 70 years
How deep does this still run in Europe
I feel like Austrian dislike of Germans can often be explained by classic neighbour rivalry, that is we are more similar than we feel comfortable with
We still have those sirens
They are tested in case of a nuclear or natural catastrophe or in case of war
Those sirens are also used in shorter intervalls to alert the fire brigade in the country side (rural fire brigades are usually voluntary forces)
>Poles don’t really mind Austrians because we are taught that the Austrian partition was fairly chill on us and if we paid taxes you didn’t minded us either
So there isn’t any Anti-Austrian sentiment
Thatś nice to hear
It was like an unspoken deal
You get to oppress the Ukrainians, we won't try to assimilate anyone and you'll support us in return
Except for that last sentence you could apply this whole paragraph to Austria and it would be 100% true
I can relate to that
My sister in law is Turkish, and she really likes German/Austrian culture
Well we Austrians are the median of this: "Austrians have rules like the Germans and break them like the Italians" is a running joke even among us
Maybe this has also something to do with the historical connection between Styria, Carinthia and Northern Slovenia
We should not forget that e.g. Styria was a country of mixed ethnicities for centuries
A friend of mine is also from northern Slovenia and he said his grandfather was German speaker
So he had also a more positive connection
From my experience this has a lot to do with the level of education
I know several Turks in Austria and Germany, including my sister-in-law who is an engineer, and they all appreciate our countries and culture
A fellow PhD
student of mine is second generation Turk and really identifies as a German
If it wouldn't be for his name, you would never guess he is of Turkish heritage
German-Turkish comedian Serdar Somuncu made a lot of good stand up comedy sketches also pointing this out
They never do
Very edgelordy indeed
*Electric guitars wailing in the distance*
Can you hear it
I think *they* have arrived
They are up that mountain side
Funny that you bring this up, I found a YouTube video about exactly that topic yesterday: [
There were multiple plans for that before WW1, support by the heir to the empire, no less
There's a theory that this is the true reason the archduke was murdered in Sarajevo
The Black Hand was afraid that a Serbian constituent country of a federation wouldn't have any interest in joining Serbia anymore
Or even worse, a united South Slavic constituent country that could claim dominion over them in the future
Sorry, but this is an oversimplification
Already famous author Grillparzer said in the 19th century "I am Austrian not a German". Historically speaking you had 2 train of thoughts: The German nationalists which considered themselves German and wanted to join the German Reich and Austrian-Germans which saw themselves distinct from the Germans and saw themselves as one of the many ethnicity in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire
There is a stark contrast between German as ethnicity and as a nation and back in the days the words were used almost exchangeable, which is still hurting Austria today
The Bavarians also don't really identify as German
They still are very keen on their privilege of being an independent state with the German Federation having their own constitution etc
And I don't start here with the Swiss
Regarding wars: I don't have a complete list, but we fought several wars against Bavaria also
The reason Hitler identified himself as German and not Austrian was that he lived in one of the border regions we obtained from the Bavarians just 50 years before his birth
Speaking of which: Yes the victim myth after WWII played a factor but more reasons to identify as Austrian was the fact that Germany didn't acknowledge Austria as it's own country
It was renamed Ostmark with the reasoning it is a made up country
There were around 30
000 non-jewish Austrians who lost their life in active resisttance against the Nazis and our first cancellors were send to concentration camps or had to flee the country
Also the reason why German-Nationalism was so popular after WWI was that Austria's economy was basically busted
It was less about ideology in the beginning
Richard Löwental said summed it up perfectly: "The Austrians wanted to become Germans, till they became Germans"
History is often more nuanced than people make it up to be, you know ...
Actually I quite know what you mean, it's just that from my experience it's mostly uneducated folks
You can observe similar trends from our own people who want "the strong man" running the country but mostly are uneducated
I guess a lot of people think that Red Bull is American, not Austrian
My father still thinks his beloved Seiko watches are a German brand, with their 'great unmatched German engineering'.
&#x200B;
I won't burst his bubble by telling him that Seiko is actually Japanese
Milka is German, as a kid I thought it is Austrian
(I think nowadays it's neither and owned by some international food conglomerate)
That the "Wiener schnitzel" is from germany and not from austria
Not sure how many of you actively know of it, but Bitdefender, the antivirus brand, is Romanian
Have been using it for a long time and thought it was American
Their new logo is even supposed to represent the battle ensign of the ancient Dacian people who used to live in what is now Romania
And many Austrians think Frucade is Austrian, not German
Jeez guys, I really just meant to say that the COMPANY Red Bull is Austrian
It is believed that the first beers were brewed by Mesopotamians, yet we can agree that Heineken for example is Dutch
it's a brand made by ferrero specifically for the german-speaking market, and after being successful, exported it to other markets
Ferror is italian but the german branch of it made Kinder
I mean, you weren't entirely wrong
The recipe is Austrian, and the Loacker family originally hails from Vorarlberg
Also, they produce their wafers in both countries, namely in South Tyrol (Alto Adige) and East Tyrol
Well you were partly right on Opel and Braun
They are both German companies that at some point (Opel in 1929, Braun in 1967) have been bought by American corporations (GE and Gilette)
That still makes them German companies in my opinion
Edit: GE to GM
Actually it's from Milan though
God bless the Austro-Hungarian Empire
I mean it's bavarian so we have quite a good claim on it
I just learned this the other day and i have not yet fully recovered
Are you expecting a list of names, or what
No without Mateschitz nobody would know of RedBull as a drink
Yes he does
&#x200B;
Seiko, founded 1891 in Heidelberg by Hans-Friedrich Seiko
I mean if I wouldn't know it better, that would sound plausible to me tbh
i always thought it was austrian, and it literally translates to "save your money" (i didnt think it was german bcs it doesnt really exist in germany)
Shows you what luxury car brand is the most successful in branding
[From me] funnily enough ;)
Me too
It was also very disappointing as a ten-year-old who spoke little English and no French
No chatting with the Princesses
I always thought it was Italian tbh, because their selection of goods seems very italocentric
Puma is the German word for cougar
Not west but south and north
The world in Austria is too small :D
Well, nonetheless without him his Thai friend would still sale his version of RedBull in Thailand
Wait, did the princesses in the park not speak French
Puma is also the Quechua word for cougar
But they didn't completely
There was(I think it doesn't exist anymore) a product line for italian food that was called de spar
Apparently the word [is of Quechua origin] so yes
I mean there are several countries without universal healthcare on this planet
92% do though
Countries without are:
- Somalia
- Mauretania
- Senegal
- Gambia
- Mali
- Liberia
- Angola
- Mozambique
- Tanzania
- Iraq
- Jordan
- Lebanon
- Turkmenistan
- Afghanistan
- Suriname
- Indonesia
- Cambodia
- United States
(I forgot some in Africa I think)
So how are we even talking about this
Of course it is working out
It always baffles me, that so many US people rant about it
It is in almost every aspect a good idea
This topic is the number one example of the greed of the wealthiest
The capitalistic system is working well in the modern world, but it needs its governmental regulations protecting the basic human needs
For a start: in a democratic country, the government works for the people
And EVERYBODY needs water, food, and safety
Without those factors, people become criminal
A country should try to avoid this for all costs, because it is way more expensive to deal with result
Its ok to let people pay for certain treatments, but the USA has taken not one but many steps into the wrong directions
I think it should be embarrassing for such a developed and rich country as the USA, not to have healthcare
Its working well
Its a system made by humans, run by humans, so of course it has its flaws
But overall I have very few complains, and it is definitely preferable to the alternative
Its of course something you'll find on your salary
as in, the money you pump into the system every month
Solidarity ain't cheap if you don't need it
However, once you need it, its a lifesaver without question
My wife's grandfather spent the last month in intensive care
He had emergency surgery six times
Now he's better
Just imagine if someone would have to pay, even if just a part of it
That would be many hundreds of thousands
Yes, public health Care is a good idea
Just an example: when I was 14 (19 now) I had a severe skiing accident where I injured my head
I had to be flown to hospital by helicopter and then stayed there for quite some time
When I got home the only bills I got were from the vending machines at the hospital, and the helicopter company (which I forwarded to my insurance and they paid it)
Now, both of my parents are in management positions, and our total household income at that time was around 11k/month pretax (~6500€/month post tax+healthcare)
My parents paid around 450€/month combined for healthcare
The helicopter bill was the only one I ever saw, and it was ~3500€, assuming a price of 500€/day(I know it's probably to low) the hospital would have cost me another ~7500€ (probably closer to 10k)
And because I was under 18 my parents didn't have to pay any deductibles
Is it common to drink tap water in your country
I do have friends from other European countries, and when I visited them, I was surprised that often they offered me still water from bottles that they bought in the supermarket
Upon asking why they wouldn't use the water from the water pipe, they were a bit confused
Here in Austria almost nobody would think of buying still water in the supermarket except if you need it on your way
Despite my research about high water quality in Europe, it seems that some don't trust their tap water
or are there other reasons
The only time people buy bottled water is when they want to have sparkling water
Tap water is as clean as can be
How often does it happen that there is a boiled water notice
I've never heard of that happening in Austria, if you are connected to water service
Edit: apparently it happens more often than I expected but hardly anybody talks about it
I'm a student in civil engineering specialised in drinking and sewage water, and I've only learned about the theoretical procedures if you find contaminants and not from real scenarios
Is the tap water in London drinkable
When I was there the first time with my school, my teacher told us not to drink it
That was in 2005
I've never heard of Brita; what's it for
There are some regions where more people use an extra in line filter
As far as I know that is due to high iron or nitrate content or high water hardness, all within quality standards though
There was a research that these filters often worsen the quality since the filters are not set up properly or not maintained regularly
I've never seen a refrigerator with a water dispenser
Temperature is a quality standard as well
I think the highest temperature is around 12°C, in Vienna depending on where you live it can be down to 7°C. For some towns it was even a reason to change their water source because temperature was to high
Not common at all
Most people would be worried that stagnant water in the fridge-pipes would be unsafe, and water comes with perfect drinking-temperature from the tab anyway
Thankfully we don't have a chlorine taste in our water that would make filtering necessary
If you slap enough money on it, everything can be made the best
Wow
Just wow
Then again, that could be a local story
>I've never heard of that happening in Austria, if you are connected to water service
Sure does happen
Not all water services use chlorine all of the time and bacteria exists everywhere
There had been a warning about half a year ago in Steyr, because they found bacteria somewhere within the system
People were advicd to boil the water before use
But that was due to some polution from a damage
What's more common here is that some kind of stuff was found in the water that makes it unfit for consumption, most of the time a higher concentration of some mineral rather than some sort of bacteria
I bought Voss water once - for the bottle
The best tap water I ever had was somewhere in the Scottish highlands
And I'm spoilt, here in Vienna we get spring water directly from the alps
My parents home has such high limestone values that it's off the grid of the mile washing machine support sheet
Lol
Though now that the village has grown bigger they had to add more springs and some of them have really low limestone values
Now they are mixing them so their water has normalised
Gotta add though: the original spring was directly under a place where the locals used to mine limestone
So no surprise it was that limestone heavy
I've never heard of chlorine or uv desinfection failing in Austria
My teacher said something about too much chlorine
And after the off putting chlorine smell during my first shower there I didn't dare to drink it anymore
The shower smelled like a swimming pool
Many small springs don't need/have constant desinfection
It can happen, that specific bacteria concentrations get too high every once in a while
Then you'll be notified by your water provider and they are obliged to fix the problem as soon as possible
It only happens in very rare cases like a huge flood
In Dublin I had the worst tap water ever,
if I lived there I would go for bottled water too
The city itself is great though
I live in a place with non chlorinated water and we had one time about 3-4 years ago when our water was not safe for consumption
interesting, we were in the area around Drumcondra
is that the good or bad side
All the time
At this point I can speak English better than German and usually use Denglisch (German + English) when texting or speaking
Sometimes I also ask my friends „what‘s ..... in german
oh yeah happens all the time
I'd say it happens most often with specific words where somehow the english equivalent just fits the intended connotation better
and sometimes, there's just no single word to easily express the same nuance, or it does, but gives a different *feeling*. words like *cringe* or *awkward* come to mind, anybody else can think of more of those
same in German tbh
while there *is* a word with the same meaning, we're just not going around as much declaring our exitedness about things
looking forward to sth
yeah
can't wait
yes
but that doesn't make us giddy and loud and *excited*, I guess
interestingly, the same also is true in the other direction
for example, I've often missed a direct english equivalent for being *gespannt* ("anxious to find out sth")
again, of course you can express the same meaning, but it's kinda clunky and just doesn't feel the same
Austo-*what*
We speak in our own dialect that‘s from the region each of us is from, if you want to know that
We learn both Austrian Standard German and German Standard German in school
Every federal state (we have 9) has it‘s own main dialect Austrians usually can pick out right away, kinda like in the US where every state has it‘s own kind of english dialect
And some federal states have more main dialects (eg Styria has normal Styrian, Altsteirisch (Old-sytrian) and Stursteirisch (a very weird form of styrian that‘s well known but not widely understood))
Overall we have many dialects, I looked up how many and according to YouTube videos too many to even count them
I hope that answered your question, if not, feel free to ask again
I don‘t understand the sentence
What do you mean by „Austria is the balkans of the german world“? Do you mean language wise we have a whole ass other language nobody understands
Because that‘s Switzerland ngl
And overall, sorry to say this, but around here the balkans have the stereotype of being quite poor and asocial ("shitty") people, and yes I know that‘s not true and a stupid stereotype but Austria definitely doesn‘t have that stereotype, if you mean this
Sorry I really don‘t really understand what any of that means /:
Putting sauce on your Schnitzel is considered a hate crime in Austria
The usual, as with most countries:
- Calling us [bigger, neighbouring nationality or people group that speaks the same or a similar language]
(Seriously, we are not Germans
Yes, we all know, we would have been considered as such 100 years ago, but it is in fact not 100 years ago
Believe us, if we say that we are not Germans, we mean that, and we know the history behind it
Don't try to teach us as to why we are acktually "ethnically" or "genetically" or whatever, Germans
Not only is that incorrect, but you'll look and sound like a fool
- Doing [certain taboo gesture] or expressing favourable views towards [historical totalitarian or autocratic regime, which is viewed very negatively nowadays]
(Seriously, don't do the Hitler salute here, it's not edgy, but only incredibly shitty
Also it's not only incredibly unfunny and unoriginal, but also incredibly illegal
And you might get punched in the face, and you would deserve it
- Eating [national food] wrong
Posing with/popping the Nazi salute "for fun" or for a picture
Should be common sense, but I've seen wayyy to many tourists doing this
You'll either get fined or beat up
You definitely shouldn't ask someone what they are earning
Schnitzel with any kind of sauce
/r/SchnitzelVerbrechen
Pouring sauce on a crisp and delicious Schnitzel
If you dare pour any kind of sauce onto Schnitzel or say Austria = Germany (we love our German neighbors, but the whole world thinks we‘re German just because our official language is German, so please refrain from that), consider yourself crucified
Especially the first one
~~Who pours sauce onto Schnitzel~~
But isn't that normal everywhere
I always greet when I enter a smaller store, it's kind of comman courtesy, no
I'm convinced the reason kurz is so hated by so many people is because he has still not made it legal to execute everyone being caught consuming, distributing or producing schnitzel with sauce without trial
"Schnitzel mit Tunke". Never an easier way to spot a German
I actually think that lynching such a person wouldn´t even be punished by courts here
Köln, Düsseldorf
all the same
:D Even their beer
Well, let's talk about Kosovo then
We have the same tradition, but I didn't know it was reserved for the dead
So does one bring *only* an even number of flowers to funerals
We also have that rule with the uneven numbers
Except for half a dozen and a dozen, those are ok
But I have no idea why it is this way
also, standing on the left side of escalators
recommended if you want to find out how passive-aggressive we can be
Hopefully both
> putting parmesan on fish or fish-based sauce
Who even would do such a thing
get a better country name then that doesn't consist of abreviations
can't really say "british" either because that will or won't correctly include some island
same reason why everybody just calls people from "the US" americans
Exactly my thoughts
I'd never enter a smaller store without greeting, it's rude
Damn, the correct answer either way is always "Wow, even better
"...
That's a dip, you can have that
They're referring to a sauce covering the schnitzel
Look up pictures od "Schnitzel in Tunke" to see what the crime is supposed to look like
> But why do i get the berry sauce with my wienerschnitzel
Because you frequent the wrong restaurants I guess
Here in Vienna, cranberry sauce is for tourists, or peasants
Hate crime
Used ketchup
As opposed to new ketchup
Ketchup and so on are okay
OP means a really liquid sauce, stuff you'd also have on a roast or smth
After she leaves primary school, maybe her taste changes
In Austria, you can have a bit of cranberry sauce with it
Do they call it Schnitzel or try to make a dish containing one
I mean, they even electrocute their breadcrumbs, not sure what kind of hate the have toward this type of food
better not mess with them
tonkatsu ≠ schnitzel
japanese are guilty of their own food crimes towards pizza, but I guess they get a free pass for the way the world has been raping the concept of sushi
First one yes, second one: NO
It's supposed to be dry
Well not dry as a desert, but Schnitzel usually should be juicy enough without liquid on top of it
Adding a bit of lemon juice or cowberries, or even ketchup is fine tho
Simple: You don't have a dry schnitzel
UwU, step-German what are you doing
Every time, man
wondering now if the same is true for you as it is for me: it helps with the shame to take extra big steps so your feet aren't touching the ground in as many places
Or "Lügenpresse" (lying press), "Systemmedien" (mainstream media), "Ostküsten-Eliten" (east coast financial elites), "kulturelle Marxisten" (cultural marxists), or "[insert well-known Jewish businessman]" (nowadays usually George Soros), which is all good old Nazi-slang, directly from the 1930s, all dogwhistling towards "tha Jeeeews".
> Also I heard it was the first country to become independent
The first independent from who
This makes no sense
So they are kinda like the French
People seem to not understand that Germany/Austria/Switzerland's borders **to each other** have been the ones that have been there the longest
North Slovenia <3
I give NAWAFL (northen austria with a funny language) the approval to call the northern part of the kingdom of hungary upper hungary
You are also allowed to use the names:
Southern carinthia (slovenia)
The land people go to if they want a cheaper italy holiday (croatia)
Greater burgenland (hungary)
Totally austrian (south tyrol)
German austria (old bavaria)
Problemmaker (bosnia and herzegovina)
For its respective regions
Best case scenario
Lingonberry jam is acceptable though, and goes fantastic with Schnitzel
There's several foreign journalists with double nationality in Turkish prisons
Catalán is like a middle thing between Spanish an Occitan
It's spoken as a first language by a majority of Catalans
If you know Spanish, you'll have an easy time understanding it on a basic level
Look:
> La vaca, en el caso de la hembra; o toro, en el caso del macho (Bos primigenius taurus), es un mamífero artiodáctilo de la familia de los bóvidos
> La vaca, en el cas de la hembra; o toro, en el cas del mascle (Bos primigenius taurus), és un mamífer artiodàctil de la família dels bóvidos
Bad schnitzel isnt allowed its a hate crime
I would call the sauce (or in good old Austrian "Schmier") just gravy
And of course it's a crime to put it on Schnitzel
Nah, it shouldnt be dry
The breading should be crispy, the inside soft and Tender
> Romansh is an official language in Switzerland, and it is only spoken here
However Ladino is also spoken in South Tyrol / northern Italy, and apparently it's closely related
No idea what that user meant with "first independent country". Independent from who
Except for the non-existing tripoint border, ironically
There's definitely far more than only 25 languages spoken within the EU
There's 24 *official EU languages* alone (and Catalan isn't one of them), so including all the official and unofficial minority languages it is certainly closer to 40-50
The 24 official EU languages (i.e. the EU publishes its laws and stuff in those languages, and MEPs hold speeches in those languages) are: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish*, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish
^(*Irish is not an official "working language" of the European parliament, for practical reasons
I.e. they don't have enough qualitfied translators)
Minority languages are among others: Albanian, Sorbian, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Sardinian, Corsican, Occitan, Breton, Basque, Catalan/Valencian, Galician, several Sami languages, Luxembourgish, Turkish, Arabic, several Romani languages, Russian, Yiddish, several Sign languages, as well as several immigrant languages such as Hindustani, Chinese, Tamil, Vietnamese, and several other unofficial or unrecognized minority languages with very small speaker communities, such as Irish Traveller Cant, , Judaeo-Spanish
I never had problems with the so-called "rude Parisians" either
> When an Austrian says Schnitzel it's breaded
We also have unbreaded Schnitzel
Usually called "Naturschnitzel". The unbreaded ones usually have a sauce
Bad Schnitzel sounds like a Kurort
you put a bit of jam on each bite of your schnitzel with your knife
> near innsbruck
Well, here you go :D
Lol sorry, now I get it - I was really confused for a moment, if you guys would re-use condiments or something :D
Yeah, sorry, that's what I meant
Hiking is different
I think in most countries, people greet each other when hiking (unless it's a very popular and crowded hike)
Obviously it depends on the context
But if a European far-right politician talks about "secret circles of east coast elites who control mass immigration" or something like that, that usually an anitsemitic dogwhistle in the tradition of the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion". Same goes for George Soros
He may be a liberal capitalist exploitative businnessman and you can definitely criticize him for that
But when people like Orban stylize him to be the devil incarnate, that definitely has some anti-semitic undertones
Soros is made the culprit for all kinds of invented bullshit on the far right
It all goes in the same direction of "the international Jewry is out for 'us' [i.e. white Europeans or whatever]".
In the case of the "mainstream media", I meant more the particular German terms of "Lügenpresse", which implies that the press as a whole always is lying, and "Systemmedien", i.e. all the media is part of some kind of "system", which is of course controlled by "the international east coast elites" aaaand whoopsie, here we are again
Our very own super-Aryan, not-at-all-corrupt, and certainly-not-Nazis-I-swear-that's-just-isolated-cases-I-promise-my-right-arm-just-has-this-tick right wing knights of the Austrian Freedom Party *love* to use terms like that
Those terms are not openly and easily recognizable Nazi-terms, but the people who are supposed to know what is meant, know what is meant
I.e. dogwhistles
My girlfriend always tells me within Spain Catalans are famous for being ratas, moneywise
I can see where that comes from XD
Well then that's definitely not true
Rome was a republic, San Marino is thr oldest still existing republic etc
So the austro-bavarian dialekts get recognized as slavic dialekts and slovakia, czechia and poland are now north slavs instead of westslavs so that austria can become a westslavic nation
Already been there
Haven't had any Schnitzel though
Haha ja wirklich
griaß eich
that's work camp for the three generations of your family
>I'm by no means a historian, but I'm pretty sure both Romansh and Ladino developed from the spoken Latin used during the time of the Roman Empire
Yes
It's either that or they are Italic sister languages of Latin who have had heavy Latin influences over two millenia
Which one it really is, is impossible to say
> the other UK languages do
> EU languages
Nah keeping English makes sense
It's the most common second language in the EU, it's spoken natively in Ireland and Malta (and potentially hopefully soon Scotland again)
There's no need to "remove" anything, because there's no maximum of EU languages
That would be kinda dumb
Irish mostly has its status bc it's *the* national language of all Ireland (Republic of), and I guess the Irish really insisted on it (Luxembourgish is – next to Turkish, but that's another story – the only national language that is not an official EU language)
Whereas Catalan is "merely" a regional language
In its own twisted way it somehow makes sense
Thanks to Madrid's language policies
But hey, in that regard Spain is still better than France, which may be hard to believe, but is a fact
For people from Vienna there's only "the city" and "the countryside". Since Innsbruck is not in Vienna, it therefor must be countryside and that clearly means the peasantry inhabits that place
Well, let's put it this way - it's not Vienna :)
I can empathize, Austrians are also ratas, we always pay separate, and turns around every cent 3 times before spending it
[Austro-Bavarian German and Swiss German]
That the super-thicc couscous right
If by "originating from Israel", you mean the country Israel which was founded in 1948, I guess, yeah ... idk
But generally, Levantine cuisine has some great shit
Yeah, some day, when all this shit is over, we will travel again
Vienna is a great place overall, and also has a very rich Jewish history
A lot of Israeli visitors come here because of that
my country comes in last in FTTH (fiber to the house)
so basically it’s fibercables to the building door and then it’s „screw you, we will lay copper wires to your appartement, because it’s fun“
Sad Schnitzel noises
If even
FTTB would be a massive improvement
Many are now getting FTTCB (curb = for a whole neighborhood) or, if worst comes to worst, no fiber cable up to the exchange (0
5 to 2km of copper)
Also our success rate for world wars we started
Thankfully
So u in anarchy
from your username I guess you’re spanish
maybe add flair, so these questions don’t occur :)
Here we have a croatian dialekt that is considered a minority language but nether serbian nor croatian is considered one even though we have way more people speaking "normal" serbian or croatian then that one dialekt
We have 340000 serbian and croatian speakers in austria
Then there are 20000 burgenlandkroaten that speak that special croatian dialekt and that dialekt is an offical minority language
then the speed thing is, what this graph was about and what grinds my gears
thanks for the response, though
> Unless we're talking speeds over gigabit copper is fine from the basement to your apartmen
FTTB isn't really a thing here either
It's mostly FTTC
I live in the capital, 120m from the national TV station
I get 32mbps
Germany is actually ahead of Austria
Nope
In Germany 3
3% of all households have FTTH/FTTB
That's better than the UK, Serbia and - Austria (1
9%)
Might I ask which one it is ?
same with austria
except for the viking part, but we can change
works for me
nice, I‘d like to see them rockin‘ it
edit: [This looks dope]
In german speaking countries, we are highly aware that we were part of the baddies in WW2
Anyone who claims otherwise is suspicious
Edit: germany and austria for the „AcTuAlLy
“ nerds in here
As an Austrian: Well, we have a kind of love hate relationship with our eternal enemy
But since they spend a lot of money here on their holidays we let them live
It´s not like we are still bitter at those bloody Saupreißn (Prussians/Germans) because of losing the battle Königgrätz
Really, we aren´t mad at those Piefke
We love them
At least their money
On a serious note: I think my generation who hasn´t been in war with any other nation is aware of our history and knows about our historic responsibility
But I do not want to be judged by the actions of my ancestors
Just as I don´t take personal pride in the good things they might have done, I don´t take personal shame for actions they have done
I am not personally responsible for neither
Uff, my girlfriend is very very very Basque
She has a friend from Valencia who is from a rich conservative family, and who has a brother who is in the military (and of course votes for Vox)
The friend is not the brightest tool in the shed, and my girlfriend is rather short-tempered sometimes
So it is a fun mix
I have witnessed my fair share of fun discussions about the civil war and Franco
One discussion started with the friend saying unironically: "Bueno por lo menos con Franco eso no pasaba" while claiming that the majority of rapes in Spain are committed by "chiuis" (or however you write that slur for Latinamericans)
It's almost a meme at this point
Same with Turks and Armenians
Or Turks and Greeks
Or Turks and Kurds
Or Turks and other Turks
Oh [you barely notice them]
You're only hearing what you want to hear
They said it's not what Germans ARE
They did not say that those that did it weren't Germans
Germany has come a long way since then and I don't think it's fair to hold people accountable for something their grandparents did
I blame you for a lot
But not this one
...please continue
Austria also had a victim mentality up to the 70s-80s. But we had to admit that our people were not really against nazi germany
So you admit that the Luxemburgish language is really German
Haha i totally did
Welcome to my life
Everytime I visit my girlfriend's family my stomach doubles in size
They are very proud, because I can eat almost like a Basque
Idk how it's written
I've heard that being used as a slur for Latinos
Chibi or Chiui
Maybe it's a local thing
And Jewish refugees have been turned away at the Swiss border, knowing that they will die in the Third Reich
I guess it was a mixed bag
[A few idealists actually were against it] many didn't care or were complacent, some pretended and tried to survive, [some – very dastardly – just went with the flow, jumping from one political camp to another whenever the felt like it helped them personally] others [wanted to profit as much as possible] without regard for how the profit is made (which is why capitalists are usually complacent with fascism)
But those that were into it (at least around 30-40% of the population), [were *really really really* into it]
That's just peak roasting
She wasn't even smart enough to be the smartest knife
How does carrying the burden look like to you
Haha, i dua di jo nur a bissal vaoaschn heast
I don't know
There's definitely a ch sound
Of course
It *was* part of Germany
I have never heard that in my entire life
I obly heard that people who were born long after WWII don't want to apologize, just acknowledge it
So no we know how carrying the burden does NOT look for you
That still leaves the quermstion of what you expect Germans to do,what do you mean by carrying the burden
Ein Jokus
Wie schön!
No no it wasn't that
I know about the slur "machupichu". It also wasn't "tiraflecha".
Whatever
it was some slur that this girl used while claiming that rapes in Spain are only committed by foreigners
And my gf went ballistic, and started talking about the absolutely disgusting manada case, where the perpetrators were – among other things – a soldier and a Guardia Civil I think, and all of them muy españoles, y mucho españoles
Yes I know
I heard all about it, and it's absolutely horrifying
Even worse is how they are ridiculing the victim
Absolutely disgusting
The best life expectancies in Italy are in the North, thats Alpine climate
Yeah and Northern Italy isn't poorer than Germany, France or the UK
Most judges are already busy all day
No need to keep them occupied even more
A higher fine would suffice
section control, vehicle impounding for repeat offenders, problem solved
The thing is that it isn't considered a proper crime for a reason, unless you're speeding too much
There's just too many cases and judges don't fall from the sky
There's just no way they can handle this many extra people
Maybe if you give out fines according to income as they do in Finland would work
We had "Maturastreich" but that is done after the final exams in the last week of school
After exams sometimes a "Maturastreich" is done
We blocked the entrance to the school parking lot with a boulder somebody brought with a tractor
Yes, in Austria it's called Maturastreich and it happens usually right after the results of the exams being announced
We locked down the whole school with iron chains except for the main entrance and asked a member of the voluntary fire brigade to fill a pool with water right before school began
We also rented a mobile bar and bought 2 barrels of beer
When school began everyone had to enter through the main entrance because the other entrances were locked
We shot everyone including teachers with water guns and got drunk
Yes, we do
Might be an urban myth, but allegedly there were some students who released 3 pigs on the school premises and numbered them #1, #2 and #4 which led to school staff looking for #3 for days
Ours is called "Matura prank" (Matura being the upper level high school finals/university entrance certification), and sensibly done *after* your final exams
The notion is that you do something stupid/funny that ideally is nice for other students but annoying for the teachers
Sometimes it devolves into vandalism though (mostly when people are too drunk during pranking)
Our class brought BBQ equipment, music and drinks and had a grill party in the school yard while blasting loud music
Regarding vandalism, I know from another class that ended up damaging some teacher's car (don't know what their original plan was) and then tried collecting money to help pay for the damage
other stories of more elaborate pranks include breaking into the school and barricading all entrances with the school furniture; running through the school building when there's still school and barging into classrooms, either shooting water guns or throwing candy into classrooms of the lower-level students
I even heard something about a severed pig's head in front of the principal's office (yeah it was a rural area)
We also had a "Maturazeitung" (Matura newspaper), mostly a self-designed and -printed/-copied collection of leaflets including funny stories and quotes of your school time, it's either sold to earn money for going drinking, or sometimes given away
Did you have that as well
We do this after the final exam
wow that's really creative; I love the idea of Matura pranks (that's what we call them, Matura being high school finals) being actually funny and requiring some work to pull off
over here, it sadly devolved into just getting drunk at school and trashing the place, and in some places has been forbidden for that reason
Wrong word boundary, pal
It's Matura (school leaving exam) Streich (prank)
for Austria it's only after your high school finals
tbh Reich just means realm, dominion, and you don't get to pretend you didn't Reich it out together with us just because you switched sides
We are not counting Reichs to begin with, that's only the Germans
We just got Austria/Austro-Hungary, then some 1st republic, then those nazi assholes, and then the 2nd republic
No Reichs involved from our side
Never heard a non native actor speak German without a noticeable accent
Even with Michael Fassbender in Inglourious Basterds, it's totally obvious
Having said this, never heard a German native talk Austrian German without an accent either
There are positive and negative examples of this
I'll never forget Jessica Lange completely butchering it in American Horror Story: Freak Show
Archer, on the other hand, did quite a good job
The Man From U.N.C.L.E, Gaby Teller is a gril from the DDR
There is one scene where she speak with her father, who is played by a German actor
And I needed subtitles to understand her
I like the film but that was so weird to watch her struggle with the sentences
Oh god yes
I am always wondering if they can’t get a German native speaker to check the wording or if they simply don’t care
No not at all
In the movie Magneto kinda "lays low" and hides from the world by becoming a worker in a Polish factory (you're more safe from the American government in a Warsaw pact country
The movie plays in the 80s I think)
It kinda makes sense that he has an accent in Polish, bc it's not supposed to be his native language
[Fassbender speaks (pretty good) German in another X-Men movie] The fact that he's a German Jew is an integral part of that scene
i just started the part of blacklist where the one guy goes to germany and none of the people involved are german natives and i can‘t concentrate because their german is just so bad
if it‘s one guy, okay
but nobody can tell me you can‘t find any german speaking guys in LA
His father is German, but he grew up in Ireland, and while his German is ok-ish, his accent is totally noticeable (not only in the film, but generally)
If I remeber correctly there is also a chase through some backyards and alleyways etc and they look so American
Like, not even close to Germany
And the license plates were completely wrong as well
Honestly they just didn't even try
Yeah his father's from Germany and he was born in Heidelberg
But he grew up mostly in Ireland, so he has a very slight but definitely notable accent
Which is a whole plot point in Inglourious Basterds, fittingly enough
[The scene]
Yeah
His German is absolutely fantastic, but the way he randomly alternates between uvular R (standard German, back of the throat) and alveolar R ("rolling R", some austro-bavarian and alemannic dialects, as well as stage-German do that, but hardly ever alternating like this; the real giveaway is the manner in which he says "rrrrrüpelhaft"), as well as the occasional vowel length and quality (too English) is pretty telling
Which makes the scene even more tense when you know German
The other guy (played by the great August Diehl) is completely aware of the situation from the very beginning
The finger-thing is just the last drop in his bucket of suspicion
"Griasdi" or "Griaseich" is normal when hiking
On the mountain everybody is informal
You would even say "du" to a doctor or an old lady
It gets interesting when you are not sure if you are high enough to be informal
Yes it is very much expected
People who don't greet back are usually either foreigners (they are kind of excused bc of language, except for Germans ofc), or from Vienna
The greeting is usually an informal/intimate "Griaß di"/"Griaß eich", as opposed to the more formal/distant greetings "Grüß Gott", "Guten Tag" or "Griaß Ihna" which you would normally use down below when talking to a stranger
It is a commonly agreed upon social norm, that at >1000m over Triest people are as a rule always per Du (informal/intimate *you*), not per Sie (formal/distant *you*) when adressing one another, regardless of age, social standing, provenance, or anything else
Because when confronted with the forces of high alpine nature, we are all equal, and in a possible emergency situation there's no time for formalities
The greeting once you reach the summit is "Berg Heil" ("Moutain Hail"), which signifies that you have achieved your goal and now can eat your bread and cheese and chocolate, and maybe have a sip of Schnaps, while enjoying the view and the silence
Everything above 1500m you say "Servus" instead of "Grüß Gott"
Grias eich
Servus
Habidere (literally translated: have the honour
or if they are clearly germans it is usually just Hallo (hello), because they look a bit confused when saying one of the above versions
Yes
It’s common to greet even strangers ever time you see them (I live in a small village in a rural valley)
However as soon as you get into a city and you greet a stranger they look at you as if you just said “go fuck yourself”.
It‘s not a tradition it‘s politeness and I guess kinda part of our culture that you say hello, wish them well or start a conversation with anybody you meet in any area (except cities or highly populated areas)
Really
Last weekend i was for the first time hiking in italy (actually a mountain on the austrian italian border) and while and all of the austrian hikers greeted as usual, to my surprise none of the italians did before i initiated contact
"Griaß di
*Man angrily points to 998m marker on a nearby rock*
"Jössasna
Grüß Sie Gott, Herr Dir
Univ
Prof
KommR i. R. Dipl
-Ing
DDr
Pospischil
Also, the city borders of Vienna are markers as well: people don't greet each other inside the city (yes, we have hills and nature inside our capital), but do greet as soon as you are outside the city limits
"over Triest" obviously
I wouldnt really say that its just the viennese
More like people from the "flat land" in general
And even they learn quick after passing some fellow travellers
"Griaß di/eich" actually
Or, "Griass Enk"
In Austria and Bavaria the most formally  neutral and way to greet someone is to say Grüß Gott
You'll hear it often when hiking along with variations on 'Grüß dich/euch/Sie' in whatever dialect of the region
Grüß Gott (Greet God) isn't very present outside of the Bavarian dialect group so often outsiders will joke back and say 'I didn't know we where this high yet' as you'd need to be in heaven to greet god
I believe they call this humour in Germany
German is a formal language and Austrians are really obsessed with titles
I don't know about Norwegian but in German you have 2 words for "you". Du (for friends, family, people that offer you to say "du") and Sie (teachers, bosses, doctors, strangers)
The same exists for greetings
Griasdi (greet you - informal) and Grüßgott (Greet god - formal)
It got more relaxed than 20 years ago but if you say "Du" to an old lady or - god forbid - to a doctor you are seen as immensely unfriendly
Edit: Unless you're hiking
We're all friends up there :)
Well, Triest is traditionally the point of reference in all of Austria, so yes
Seriously
It's commonplace where I'm from (OÖ)
It's not so much a set rule, but just convention
It's *kinda* informal, but not too bad
It usually is used between friends and acquaintances, not for people you don't know or have to interact in a professional manner with
Griass Enckkk
Actually it was in friuli/carinthia and it was an intermediate difficulty
However we didnt encounter too many people further up and most of the italians looked more like tourists than hikers tbh, so i guess thats it
Yes
I remembered that when I read your post
I have never heard it in carinthia or styria
We used to own it
Was our biggest port
Good times
Heard it plenty of times in carinthia
How often have you been to the peak of a mountain
Meh
Nowadays it's all in the EU family anyways ️️
The Krampus thing
I saw the movie ,,raw" from 2016 when we stayed at a hotel when we went to cracow for a schooltrip
It was bizzare how the narrator read the dialogue between 2 persons
Well since the krampus is an alpine thing I'd say our hate for EVERY NATION in the whole world
I couldn't think of a country we like
ah, we used to do the same
got the fish from our neighbor though, didn't have to buy it
That was my favourite part about Spain
There is something nice about eating lunch at 3 and dinner at 10
as long as they don't offer to massage your neck and shoulders while you're standing at the urinal like in SEA
My south tyrolean neighbor shudders when I mention that I sometimes add a bit of Berbecue ketchup when I make sugo
ok you got me
that's the first one where I have to say I haven't seen that yet at home
maybe because most people who own cattle have a truck or transporter here
That's just normal
Just imagine a perchtenlauf in the USA
That really sounds like a French stereotype
popular with inner city Bobo parents here too; the bike models are normally imported from NL
It's the opposite here
I can never imagine only being in my shoes at home
Whenever I visit a friend, I always take them off
Whenever I visit my family in the states, though, I keep the instinct of taking off my shoes
I had to keep my shoes on every time I entered a house
Thankfully, when I rent a hotel room or an AirBNB, I always got to take my shoes off :)
As in the card game
yeah used to be a thing, don't think carp is still very popular though
we had it once on Christmas Day, but I don't think we bought it live
Keeping it in the bathtub also helps filter any mud from the pond out of the fish, a common complaint about carp is that it tastes like a swamp
Well they were part if Austria after all, it's lovely that they still have the drink and use a name based on the Austrian one
Oh no
I am a weirdo
Even in Iceland they keep their swimsuits on in the Sauna
in sweden
source: study in sweden right now
The hottest saunas we have are called Finnish Sauna, and they're about 90°
you get sued, and *you* get sued
by god why doesn't she just get a wheelbarrow bike
I've seen some in Denmark that had four seats, could even take a friend home, or dump her shopping in there
selecting for quiet babies; clever
Well ethnic Tyrolean but with strong Italian influences
Well they are all Italian already and one notices that when compared to North Tyroleans xD
oh sorry, I meant more like [this] or [this] or [this]
Do you have non-FKK saunas in Germany
Oh no i'm so sorry
unless you drink diluted ethanol

„einen polnischen machen“, roughly translated “doing a polish“ for leaving a party without telling anyone, including the host
"Hinter schwedische Gardinen wandern" (To go behind Swedish Curtains) is a German expression for going to prison
We do not have an expression for splitting the bill among a group, because it is common practice here that each person always pays their own food and drinks
We just call that "paying".
We have other other expressions for other stuff though
- Something that is "behmisch"/"böhmisch" or bohemian is something that is a knock-off, a poor imitation or cheap quality (sorry neighbours)
Funnily enough there's a huge park in Vienna, the famous *Prater*, and there's also a less famous and smaller and less fancy *böhmischer Prater*. Both are actually very beautiful though
The latter bears this name, because it's in Favoriten, where all the "Ziegelbehm" lived, i.e. all the Czech immigrants who came to work in the Viennese brick making industry in the 19th century
Maybe the expression has something to do with that
- An "Engländer" is a tool, which you would call a monkey wrench in English
- "Einen Polnischen (Abgang) machen", to do a Polish (exit), is something I've heard
It's would be our equivalent to an Irish goodbye
- A "Russenluster" or Russian chandelier is a lamp without lampshade and without properly hiding the cable work
Usually used as a provisionary measure, e.g. when moving, at construction sites, when you really want to live in that "poor student" aesthestic in your early 20s, etc
[Like this]
- A "Russian" can also be pickled fish
In Germany they call it "Bismarckhering" I think
- A "französische Dusche" or French shower is when you are in need of a shower, but just use a large amount of deodorant or similar things instead
Classic among 14-year olds after PE class
- The "Franzosenkrankheit" or "Franzosenpest", the French plague, is of course syphillis
- Ironically you can prevent this sickness with a "Pariser" (Parisian), i.e. a Condom
- When a prostitute offers "französisch" as an extra service, that does not mean there's going to be language classes, but rather sex without a condom
- Same with "griechisch" (Greek) and anal sex
- Same with a "spanische Krawatte" (spanish necktie) and mammary sex
- Speaking of which, the "Krawatte" comes from a people called "Krawodn", which is a dialect term for "Kroaten", i.e. Croatians
- A "Schwedenbombe" or Swedish bomb is what they call a "Mohrenkopf" or Moorish head in Germany (yes, that's racist), i.e. a kind of small chocolate-covered cake filled with foamy sugar
"Schwedenbombe" is an example of a brand name (they are produced by the Viennese company Niemetz) becoming a general name
Schwedenbomben have a 95% market share among "Mohrenküsse" in Austria, because they're the best
They are called like that because the inventor got the idea from a Swedish friend
- "Schwabo" means "Swabian" in Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian and is a common expression for "German-speaker" among people from the ex-Yugoslavian countries
There is a German expression "Leben wie Gott in Frankreich" (to live like God in France), meaning to live carefree and in excess
It eighter comes from the wealth and privilege of the clergy in pre revolutionary France, or from the lack of influence the catholic church had after the revolution, meaning that in France God has now retired and can lean back and enjoy his life
Das schaut russisch aus/Der russische Weg/
Smth
looks russian/The russian way (to do smth
Used mostly for when something is made in a way that seems crude, but actually works
Same logic goes for the russian way to do something
Sometimes other eastern countries are used instead, but Russia is the most common
not "not right", rather "hard to understand", akin to "ich verstehe nur Bahnhof"
Also "Ich versteh' nur spanisch" "I only understood spanish" means that you actually don't understand what the other person said
Another favourite of mine is also "Fachchinesisch" "field chinese" when someone is talking about rather complicated stuff from a specific (technical) field
In Austria it's a bohemian village :)
>Orbán doesn't actually want out of the EU, not while *he gets* lots of money from them anyway
FTFY
Its at the same time Eastern Europe, Central Europe and Central Eastern Europe
There are multiple classifications of this which differ according to what kind of historical development or regional differences you want to express
Its the same with the Balkans that may or may not include Slovenia, Greece and Romania
Its a well known fact that the Balkans begins at the Ringstraße xD
Yeah making such a fuss about academcial fuzzy definitions of regions is just plain dumb
Its so malleable that it becomes meaningless
I cannot understand most people from one state (Vorarlberg) because their dialect is so different compared to the rest of Austria
Many Germans have a problem with understanding the local dialect I speak
It’s really far from being German as not only the words but also a lot of grammar is completely different
Jessica Lange in American Horror Story: Freak Show
Voralberger dialect is impossible to understand
It’s suppose to be an Austrian dialect of German (which I speak) but it’s nothing like it
Yeah all the time
We have very weird dialects
When I drive 1 hour in a certain direction my Mom won't understand any person there
I can somewhat communicate there though
A good example which demonstrates this is the movie "Die Hard".
A good example which demonstrates this is the movie "Die Hard".

I personally don’t even count Swiss German as German because who tf can even understand them besides the Swiss
But then again that’s what many German must think about Austrian dialects as well
I think Gus' actor is Italian
"waaay down, waaay down, waay down
Tbh most of us younger people don't really speak with such a strong dialect anymore
I think it's not that hard to understand us, but even I sometimes struggle to understand the older generations because they still use dialect words that we don't use anymore
>"I am sorry, could you please speak slowly and more high German
I get what your problem was, but it's not hard to guess, that this triggers Austrians too
(The prejudice goes, that high-German-speakers think of themselves as more civilized in a way)
Recently read a story about a german moving to Vienna
They heard "pfiat di" and thought it was the alpine version of "fick dich", thinking people just casually insulted each other as a goodbye
Like, I wouldn't even mind mind if they got some native speaker actor from the street, who speaks in a super weird dialect (like Bernese or Platt or whatever), but this is just insulting
>I personally don’t even count Swiss German as German because who tf can even understand them besides the Swiss
Says the Austrian
>But then again that’s what many German must think about Austrian dialects as well
yeah
I can, although I'm from a region with a bavarian-based dialect
Understanding spoken language is easy to me, when reading r/BUENZLI I sometimes have to imagine the word spoken out loud to figure it out
Well I'm from Vorarlberg and I can understand most of them
>14 hour flight
If you fly over Aruba, maybe
But you're still right, it is far apart, but more in the sense that the heaviest dialects can be found in "remote" places
Lmao I love that and totally agree with you
Bavarian and swiss german are different languages
No, high German is what developed in Germany as a "common denominator German". But while in Austria (and probably all German speaking nations besides Germany) it is much more common to speak dialect, but *write* in high German, Germans have widely adopted it for speaking as well
This is all just personal experience from discussing this with Germans
It also seems like the sentiment is completely different
In Germany it is almost unaccepted to insist on speaking your own dialect, while Austrians almost see high German as a foreign influence, although it is of course taught in schools and you will never find i.e. official emails in dialect
I believe you
I just think being aware of these things can only help
That's also why I said it is the prejudice
That doesn't mean it's true
Me too
Someone else thought everyone stopped working at 5 and said "Fertig
" to each other :D
And nevertheless is my „remote place“ less than an hour from the German border in a valley with 40
000 inhabitants
So not remote at all
The Germans across the border are Bavarians
Unless if you're from Vorarlberg, I'd be surprised if they don't understand you
Ok u/HungryAndHornySlut
Yeah I guess
Now if you tell me the people in London on average come closest to speaking 'BBC English' then it's pretty much the same
I guess you also have a kind of similar language situation with the USA as Austria and Germany
Sure, I understand that
I wasn't trying to say you should have understood her if that's how it came out
Even if she wasn't from Vorarlberg ;)
I really don’t get it
I’m from Tyrol, we are not remote at all
We speak a dialect many Germans don’t understand, even Bavarians
Oh ok, well I didn't expect that
May I ask which region in Tyrol that is
The Zillertal
As I said, around 40
000 inhabitants in a valley that’s around 40km long
I myself live 60km away from the capital Innsbruck and it’s less than an hour drive to the German border
It´s pretty much the same here
In older times there was a different saying though
Back then the postal service and railroad (owned by the state) were a pool for people who didn´t really want to work and still enjoy several benefits
The saying was:
"Wer nix taugt und wer nix kann,
geht zur Post oder zur Bahn
Wer auch dafür z'deppad ist,
der wird Polizist".
(very) rough translation:
"Those who are useless and incompetent will work at the postal service or the railroad corporation
Those who are even too stupid for that will become police officers
I wouldn´t say this still applies nowadays anymore though
Street sweeper
Although city employees are decently paid AFAIK
Wer nichts weiß und wer nichts kann geht zu Post und Bahn (He who knows nothing and can't do anything can go to the postal service or the railway) absolutely don't agree with it but it's a ryming :)
That Austria is more responsible than Germany for WW2 because Hitler was born here
An increasingly common narrative
A little late to the game, but here we go:
My best friend's host family in Ireland was really disappointed when we told them, that the majority of Austrians do not live in the mountains (and that there are areas that aren't mountain-y but rather flat)
Like directly next to - or rather on - a ski slope
And no, we don't all ski to our schools or jobs everyday
I'm from the northern hemisphere, not the southern one
Some americans think that we're australia and are suprised when you explain that that's a dirfferent country
Well what was your favourite wine
Fun fact, unicorns were hunted to extinction because unicorn meat is considered a delicacy with aphrodisiac properties in Finland
What about your supreme leader
Every time someone claims that nazis were left wing, somewhere a political scientist gets a stroke
Oh the discussions I've had about that one
Despite all the evidence
I dread the possibility of Sanders winning and media outlets announcing the US to be a "socialist" country now
Somehow someone needs to teach them more fitting political terminology
You dont get it, the more the state does the more socialist it is, thats how it works
You know what's worse
People from your own country talking about "no-go zones" in your own capital
I have been asked by family members from rural regions what kind of weapons I wear use to survive the constant attacks in Vienna
To be fair, a LOT of teachers explain the Berlin Wall really badly, even here in Europe
When I was taught about in school I only had the vaguest (and wrong, as it turns out) notion on what it looked like and how it worked
Our teacher never really explained in an understandable way that Berlin was a special case city smack dab in the middle of East Germany
For the longest time I believed that the  regular border between East and West just happened to run through Berlin because my teacher always talked about the Berlin Wall as a wall between the East and the West and mentioned it in the same breath as the iron curtain
Which, technically correct, but quite misleading
This was pre-internet and it took me years to have my misconception corrected
If he had mentioned that Berlin was *behind* the iron curtain, that some small parts of it belonged to the west because of symbolism and that the Berlin Wall worked like a medieval city wall I would have caught on a lot earlier
Don't be ridiculous
Everybody knows that rich Texans ride to school in tanks
Poor Texans have to use assault rifles like stick horses
> Some will get offended and argue if you label US policies they support as "socialist".
I mean, that's no different here
For some reason, y'all seem to use that word in the wrong context a lot
That's exactly the crux of the issue
There can be no debate that, no matter the reason, the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war against Serbia is what sparked WW1
But this, combined with the fact Hitler happened to be born in Austria, gave rise to the commonly accepted, revisionist narrative that "Austria started both world wars". Ignoring that Hitler was a *pan-German* nationalist, hated Austria as its own political entity, and came to power in Germany as a German citizen, and considered himself German and was considered as such by others
That *after* the Anschluss, when Austria was a functionally fully part of Nazi Germany, many Austrians gleefully took part in WW2 Nazi crimes, is a whole other, separate can of worms
Mostly anglo "history bros" and smug Germans
The old and tired Hitler-Beethoven joke also doesn't help
Deine Landsleute immer wieder mal zum Beispiel
Lots of idiotic memes too
Like once a week someone thinks they're totally funny by posting a "haha Austria started two world wars and blamed both on the Germans" picture to r/Austria
look at the discussions under such posts on r/historymemes, the prime sub for armchair historians
> What would a no-go zone be
Actually it is a zone closed off by barriers and hooded men
Nobody can enter or exit unless their skin tone is [in the lower part of this chart] There's huge portraits of Shakira - hips be upon her - in all the streets
They have loud-speakers everywhere, out of which the song ["Danger Zone"] blurrs at a high volume 24/7
They were right though, your English is pretty good :P
Just imagine my American relatives reacting to me saying that the local party close to the Neonazis had German liberal roots
They thought I was one of the left= Nazis idiots
Easy mistake to make
Cadillacs are driven to church, gun shows, football games and the oil fields, not school
Well, I guess that's somewhat up to how you personally define it, but socialism has a fixed definition with not that much wiggle room
Many of my close relatives, includign my great-grandfather, were massive Nazis and Hitler supporters early on before and after the Anschluss, so believe me, I know this stuff better than anyone
And Austria was occupied by the Allies just like Germany until 1955, when they left on the condition that Austria declare itself "eternally neutral". How exactly do you think it should have been punished more
Split into two parts and remained under occupation to this day
Nobody ever did
Fun fact about that second shot: It came from one of the biggest Austrian war ships in the Danube fleet, and was fired onto the city of Belgrad
Austria-Hungary had a fleet on the Danube
Yeah, nobody ever denied that
The actual first shot of the war
Princip's shot started it, but that wasn't yet war, just terrorism
I'm pro vaccinations but against any forced medical procedures
Who needs a law for that
Just charge them with the crime they commit, attempted murder
Stupidity doesn't hold in court and isn't a legal defence in any form
Vaccinations are great
They not only protect you, but they protect people around you that can't be vaccinated due to age, illness, or allergies
By having less and less people immunized against diseases, the disease can reach these people and kill them
Yes, it will kill them
The diseases which vaccines prevent against - whether it's polio or even the flu - are not a joke
They can cause life threatening fevers and complications
They can cause life lasting side effects
They can kill you
By not vaccinating your kids, you not only harm them, but you also harm others
Vaccinations should never be a choice
They must be mandatory unless you cannot have them due to allergies, age, or illness, PERIOD
> with exceptions made for immun-compromised people and other similar cases where vaccinations are too dangerous
No one ever suggested that those people should be vaccinated
I couldn't agree more
Sometimes I even think antivaxers have our best interest in mind
All they want to do is solve the overpopulation crisis guys, why all the hate
So you are fine with asocial people putting others at risk
LOL this must be the most hilarious case of "internet lawyer" that I've ever seen
No I'm not fine with it but forced medical procedures are worse - dictatorship style
I don't want the government to force their citizens to get substances injected
Sure, vaccinations are great
This is just too authoritatian
This isn't "dictatorship style". What happens here is requesting that citizens take their responsibility for society (people benefit, not the government or the leader) seriously to get benefits paid for by society
And besides that, most mandatory vaccinations are targeted at children who cannot decide for themselves anyways
Not to English but to Spanish
I used to live in a student dorm with lots of international students with a shared kitchen (shared between 15 people or so), and a disgusting microwave that no one ever cleaned and thus often became moldy inside and everybody always complained about it
So someone "solved" the problem by putting a sign with a graphic instruction to clean the microwave after using it and then a sentence in 3 languages (Spanish bc of some Argentine exchange students who barely spoke English, let alone German):
ACHTUNG SCHIMMEL
BEWARE OF THE MOULD
CUIDADO EL CABALLO BLANCO
The last one means/is supposed to mean "Beware of the white horse", because the German word "Schimmel" means both the fungus called mould, but it can also be used to describe a white horse
Whoever wrote the sign either thought they were funny, or just didn't know better
The Argentines had no idea what was going on, the fact that later someone drew a white horse on the sign didn't make it better
Good thing we also had a Mexican dude with very good English and German skills, he explained it to them
This is one of my favourites here so far

When I hear body bag, I think of Tatort, not of a backpack

Is it
It's pretty normal for the height of summer
It rained and cooled over the last few days
Today was the first hotter day in a week and it was humid as fuck
It's supposed to become pretty hot soon, I like it
I‘m doing surprisingly ok
I guess the Alps and other mountain ranges help to cool the temperature a little bit
Not saying that it‘s really cool over here, but those 19-24° are way more welcome than the 25-28° my german friends have
Agreed, not so bad here
Last time I checked, Vienna is at an astonishing altitude of about 150m above sea level
So whatever are you on about
Not really how it works
It's cool in the low regions of Austria too
I don't even live in the mountains but around 280m and the whole of May was rainy and June had about 4 days of sunshine so far, at this point I would kill for 2 weeks of 40 degrees
You do too
And don‘t forget to drink water
> The avg
elevation of Austria is also 910m.
Averages are pretty meaningless, especially if it does not consider population distribution
Look at all major cities, they are well below that
Vienna ~150m, Graz ~350m, Linz ~250m, Only Salzburg (~430m) and Innsbruck (~570m) are a little higher up, but still way below that average
OTOH everything below ~35 is easily bearable, bitching about 28°C is a bit
weird
Especially considering that a lot of people also go on holidays in warmer regions
It rained a lot here in the last few weeks, so I am happy it has finally warmed up a bit more
Today it was 26 degrees and tjat was the hottest day this week so far
That's not hot
Edit: actually my colleague had to wait 45 minutes outside this morning and she was cold
In jeans and a cardigan
I really feel like I am in a different universe
It certainly isn't that hot here haha :)
We'll see
Now we got a few sunny days before a possibly rainy start of July but fingers crossed it's just a pessimistic weather report
Sadly I can't make use of the warm days now because I got some nasty angina but at least my girlfriend can go out a bit
the grumpy Austrian trying to bond over shared complaining, and the exuberant USian trying to bond over being positive
how very interesting to see
I am not complaining
I think the weather is great
Not too hot and not too cold
I can still open my windows in the morning and let some fresh cool air in
It just sounds like we are the exception here in Europe
France is not the second largest country
Ukraine is bigger
France is the 3rd largest
I think it‘s because all major central european rivers are located near or in the Blue Banana, with the river that was the central point of travel and the economy, the Rhine/Rhein, starting, going through and ending in the Blue Banana Region
And after that with river Po ending (I think
) inside the Blue Banana and also Thames starting, going through and ending in the Blue Banana Region
But france isn't situated entirely in europe
Skis also
But alpine skis, not cross-country skis like you nordics
Beer or Spritzer in our hands, a cigarette in our mouths and complaining about that from the start
I'd say us Brits are born with a cup of tea in our hands
Man if you had any kind of ground elevation i'd be all over your country
Nah, also Skis just like Norway
Alpine skis though
I'm Krapfen
Gave me a proper chuckle there :D
When someone in Austria asks me I feel Viennese
If someone from another European country would ask me, I would say Austrian
&#x200B;
And if someone from outside of Europe asks me, I usually say that I'm German, because I'm sick and tired of talking about Kangaroos, Koalas and Australian Rule Football or whatever this is
That's the age old enthnicity vs nationality question, I'm neither but half Irish so it's always the question, am I Austrian because I was born and raised here
Am I Irish because those ethics were put into me by my father
Am I both
And it always depens on the person you're talking to, if it's with an austrian then it depends on the topic, if it's about anything but Ireland/Immigrants I'm Austrian, and vice versa with an Irishman
It's either Liezen or maaaaybe Graz if you'd ask me, they're a not that ugly but I'd say they are somewhat close
People here tend to say St
Pölten
It's not as bad as people think though
I drove past the city a few years ago and I had no intention to stop there
It's really a shame, considering how beautiful other cities in your country are
Wels is way more ugly than Graz
Cannot speak for Liezen though
Graz is beautiful
Whaaat, Graz isn't ugly
You want an ugly city
Take Linz
Linz is really ugly
But i agree on Liezen
Terrible
Nah, it's obviously St
Pölten
Graz is not at all ugly
Only the southern and western parts
Since i moved from eggenberg/wetzelsdorf to jakomini, i can see its beauty
My top pick would be Oberwart
There is nothing nice in this city
Oh yeah, Wels too
Though to be fair none of them are even close to the given examples, we have pretty high standards
The only city that came to my mind was Linz
I don't think I've ever seen an ugly city in Austria besides Linz
I've never been to Liezen tho
Have you ever even visited Linz
I've been living there for the past three years, and it's so much more beautiful than Vienna or Graz
Yeah, it has its problem districts, but which city hasn't that
If you leave the Landstraße behind you you can get into some beautiful neighbourhood in less than five minutes
ACAB, Austrian Cities Are Beautiful
Wels
Wels is like Linz without the good looking parts
Yes, I've been to Linz a few times
I wouldn't have written what i wrote if that wasn't the case
I still don't like the City
Never been in Wels but also not planning to go there, especially after reading this
I can see a lot of them, depending on where I go in the city
Vienna's had an ongoing disagreement between the governing coalition parties about how to deal with that problem (more bans/police vs
more social workers), and it continues to be an issue around certain hot spots (mostly train or subway stations)
Going home after work I sometimes pass screaming and fighting, extremely drunk, drugged or otherwise crazy people, I'd say it happens about once or twice a week
But it depends where you look of course
In the touristy city center, you won't see many (beware of scammers and pickpockets instead)
Also *inside* public transport it's a lot better that outside
I encounter people like the above only about once per month inside the actual trains
Beggars are more common sitting the stations though
I think it's mostly a problem of how your psychological health system is set up
Secondly it can be facilitated through local climate, and it's also influenced by available housing and shelter systems, but also by common-sense stuff like building layout/zoning (no shops that sell alcohol near entrances, etc)
To a lesser degree is is also an issue of security/police presence (although I find it makes places feel *less* safe when there's always these damn grumpy security guards running around) and alcohol bans (Vienna had its first anti open container area designated around a train station recently for that reason)
I think it's actually Asia that's doing a lot better in that regard than the West
I mean, in the warmer areas you'll have lots of homeless of course (facilitated by the climate), but they're not as loud/crazy/aggressive as the ones we seem to have here
They probably have less patient rights and just lock up whoever behaves a bit too weirdly
Artikel 1
Österreich ist eine demokratische Republik
Ihr Recht geht vom Volk aus
Austria is a democratic republic
[The republics] might comes from its peoples
Article 1
Austria is a democratic Republic
The people have the Power
I really like the short and simple and yet meaningful language
What I don't like in constitutions (and legal texts in general) is that festive language that you can find for example in Germany's constitution
Austria is a Republic
It's power lies with the people
> the supremacy of God and the rule of law
Which one is it then
It's funny how both the Canadian and Australian constitutions mention God in the first sentence, meanwhile the Spanish one (also a constitutional monarchy) apparently does not
We have a very similar story
Only here the dates are [1920] and [1934]
Our constitution is an interwar constitution as well
Even if they did, reinstating it later still makes it an interwar one
I mean ours did change in between of course, but that doesn't change the nature of our old constitution

that's how AirBnB was actually *meant* to work, people renting out a room in their house or, for the daring ones, their apartment while they're gone
just a little extra money, no real influence on the housing market and below taxable levels, all's fine
now it's all semi-professional renting companies and fake profile pics of the "couple" you're renting from, and then you turn up and it turns out the whole apartment is managed by a guy professionally, with on-call service and little packaged bathroom amenities
it's all a huge tax evasion scam and normal people can't find apartments to rent anymore because it's all used for what's basically illegal hotels now
... and the worst part is, people apparently are *expecting* that shit now

That we had a fascist dictatorship and a civil war before the Nazis came
And that the party that lead this dictatorship is in power now
Yeah, everything between world war 1 and 2 is the first thing which comes in my mind
I’m not sure how ‘brave’ Michael actually was, as only two days later after his glorious unification, the Ottomans were already marching again through Bucharest
As much as it pains me to say, his myth is only a part of the communist rewriting of the national history from the time they needed heroes to base their national pride on
While I’m sure the guy did some outstanding deeds at the time, he was by far not as potent as Romanian historiography still claims he was

The revolution wasn't just in Prussia it was all over the multitude of German states
It was a cry for unification which actually for a time succeeded and an assembly was formed in Frankfurt but then it failed and so German unification came from up top and not the general populace
It's technically not illegal to eat Wiener Schnitzel with sauce
But it should be
Going to watch a movie in cinema alone
The first few times I did felt strange, but now, well, before the whole pandamic shit went down, I almost all the time go solo
It is just easier if you don't have to plan with other people in mind and find the right time and cinema
Even more so if it is a movie I want to see asap, for example to avoid spoilers or just hyped about to see
I honestly learned so much from [this video] arte is an invaluable service
Yeah that sounds about right
The traditional version also is really puffed up as well
Having the schnitzel lying in a sauce does destroy that puff and crispness
So I usually eat lingonberryjam(~european cranberry
) with it
I just dip the piece I am about to eat in it or spread the jam onto that piece
Well it's jam and not sauce
The problem with sauce is losing the crisp puff breading from the schnitzel
As the breading soaks itself
The lingonberry jam isn't as liquid and you usually just dip the piece you are going to eat in it
Main difference sauce is liquid and the schnitzel soaks it up, lingonbery jam isn't completely solid but doesn't soak the schnitzel
both systems have their advantages and disadvantages
see my comment [here]
haha and I just wanted to post this [relevant introduction to the topic in german]
hah funny coincidence that that's exactly how we do it here: no refills or hovering waiters, very little tipping
also see the comment [here] that explains why
Austrian German has hungarian and slavic influences that regular German does not
I think the fact that you can make words infinitely long
For example, if we want to describe a certain thing we just plaster two words/nouns together
E.g. Handtuch (towel) is literally Handcloth or the well known Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz is word by word translated: Beefetiquettemonitoringtasktransferlaw
And because of that we have a word for e v e r y t h i n g. There‘s no thing that doesn‘t have a german word
And if it really doesn‘t, make up one of your own
Really, if you know how to plaster random words together then you can make up words of your own and everybody will understand it
Or maybe also that you can move the words around in a sentence and it will still mean the same
It just shifts the attention from the human to the object to the time to the place etc etc
I noticed not many languages have that
English and German are one of the few I can think of right now
E.g.
* Ich habe heute viele Bäume in Österreich gesehen
(I saw many trees today in Austria
)  (Attention is on the human)
* Viele Bäume habe ich heute in Österreich gesehen
Attention is on the thing - here the trees)
* Heute habe ich viele Bäume gesehen
(Attention is on the time - here today)
* In Österreich habe ich heute viele Bäume gesehen
(Attention is on the place - here Austria)
Ofc you can shift the words also in many more ways, but that‘s about the main few
Depending on how you shift the verb it becomes an exclamation or a question too:
* Habe ich heute viele Bäume in Österreich gesehen
(Verb is first place so it‘s a question
* Ich habe heute viele Bäume in Österreich gesehen
(For this sentence exclamation is about the same thing as a normal sentence so yeah
Other things that are pretty unique imo:
* Ä, Ö and Ü aren‘t letters of their own (In languages like finnish and estonian they are)
They‘re shortcuts for ae, oe and ue
If the letters aren‘t available on websites a German would just write ae, oe or ue without thinking too much about it
* ß is a shortcut for sz
It‘s basically an s and a z stacked together
Really, look at old german writing: the s used to be written similar to a modern f and the z used to have a weird underthingy like a handwritten g. The ß used to have one too, but I guess it kind of faded along with the one the z had
Reminds me of a story a guy told me
He was from the US and came to Salzburg (Austria) to study trumpet at the university
He knew German before but of course not at a native speaker level, let alone Austrian dialect
So one day his professor told him during a rehearsal: „Sie können ruhig lauter spielen“. (literal translation: „you can quietly play louder“. And he was sitting there wondering how to do that
The actual translation of the sentence is: „Don‘t worry, you can play louder“. The word „ruhig“ means quiet, but is also used as „don’t worry“.
German has that too, it's just pronounced differently
"Die Magd" definitively isn't neutral, though diminuitives always are and "das Mädchen" (which is the currently preferred translation for "the girl") thus is
One phrase that comes to mind would be "Es geht sich aus". Literally translated "It goes itself out". A sentence that initially confuses a lot of Germans that move to Austria
It can be applied in a lot of different contexts and usually means that there is enough of something (time, money, space)
"Shit, I am late
sorry, will we still reach the train in time
"Yes, das geht sich aus
The verb in that context has its origin in Czech and is a literal translation of "vyjít" (according to an article I found)
Other words that come to mind:
Kukuruz (Serbo-Croatian origin, from 'kukuruz') = Corn
(Standard German word for it is 'Mais')
Powidl (Czech origin, from 'povidla') = Plum jam
(Standard German word for it is 'Pflaumenmus')
Strizzi (Czech origin, from 'strýc' = uncle) = cheeky or mischievous person
(apparently also a word for pimp)
(Standard German word with a similar meaning \[minus the pimp\] would be 'Lausbube')
Bussi (probably Czech origin, from 'pusa' = kiss) = an affectionate, non-sexual kiss, usually on the cheek
(I don't think there is an equivalent in Standard German)
Deschek (Hungarian origin, from 'tessék' = please) = uhm
like someone who has to do all the work
I guess a good example would be a group project, where one does the majority of the work
"Am I the deschek
" would be a rhetorical question as a response to your group (that keeps asking you "Could you do X for us
" whilst not doing much themselves) as a signal that you really don't appreciate the current situation
(Not sure what the Standard German equivalent would be)
Mulatschag (Hungarian origin, from ' mulatság'=revelry) = revelry
(Standard German word would be 'Festlichkeit')
There are also more Italian influences in Austrian German than in Standard German like Karfiol (ital
: ' cavolfiore') = cauliflower  ...and so on
(Standard German word is 'Blumenkohl')
It's mostly just vocabulary
In fact, it is so commonly used that some words, like „Mädchen“ (girl) have become standard
The suffixes -lein, -el, -erl, -li, etc
can also be used and have the same meaning
But that's not the dual form
> they follow no logical pattern
at all
They do in Althochdeutsch and previous Germanic languages - modern German is full of simplifications, vowel shifts and other stuff
That's the results I got, when I googled for origins of the listed words above
there didn't seem to be any ambiguity as to where they are coming from (except Kukuruz, which listed Serbian and Czech as origins)
There are also words, that have its origin in Slovene, or were influenced by Slovene
[Keusche] for example
Sumemr time
I don't understand how anyone wants it to be dark earlier
> I have a few weeks of confusion ahead
I have some days of absolute joy because it's still light outside in the evening
But now even in summer it get's dark earlier
Yeah, I agree, I'd rather have summertime in summer, and switch one hour even further into that direction in winter, to have the sunset at 5 instead of 4 in December
Haha
Is a bikini two kinis or every second kini
>Heart attack rates go up after the clocks go forward
for a day but not in average for the week (which suggest that people who would have gotten a heart attack anyways just got it a few days earlier)
Also I don't get it
Just go to bed an hour earlier or get up an hour later and you have the same amount of sleep
It's not rocket science
Seems like many of these problems are caused by work and school(!) simply starting too early (the latter is conformed by noumerous studies)
If you start later summer time is no problem any more
My natural rhythm I slide into is working between 10 and 18
Summer time means more light afterwards
yeah, much better than no sun after 5pm
Funny thing is that biweekly means either twice a week or every two weeks
> i) that still indicates that changing to summertime puts the body under stress
No it doesn't. It indicates that people sleeping one hour less for a day puts the body under stress
>ii) the same studies also show that the risk of heart attacks drops after the change back to standard time in winter, indicating that the body never fully adapted to summertime
Again, it doesn't. It just indicates that sleeping an hour longer reduces the risk of an heart attack for a day
There's no significant differences in heart attack rates in summer times vs normal times that can be traced back to the changing the time
> it's about the mismatch of the circadian clock and social clock
True that
Our "social clock" is absolutely terrible
Starts much too early
During summer if not forced into some kind of schedule my natural rythm tends towards going to bed at about 1am and get up at 9am
Interestingly summer time means I get much more sun
>cortisol metabolism has been shown to adapt by only 2 minutes instead of 60 minutes
[Are you talking about this study
] Because you seem to completely misunderstand it
During DST the time is changed by an hour and the cortisol phases change by "only" 58 minutes, so almost an hour, not 2 minutes like you constantly claim
I wonder
Do people like you go to bed/get up at the same time every day
Never stay up a little late or go to bed early
>You would cancel out any positive effect a later start of school and work day would have
For half a year: yes
For the other half year the time doesn't change so the effect is positive
\+ you get the very nice positive effect that the afternoons/evening have sun
Which for me personally is super important for my mental health
Basically everyone I know is always looking forward to going to summer time and hates going the other way because it's just so damn depressing having no sun in the afternoons
I seem to have the superpower to be able to sleep even while not being tired enough so that i actually *need* it
> But I'm definitely not going to start discussing anecdotal evidence, that's not science but personal opinions
But I don't care about what is better on average (over I guess multiple latitudes, which skews the results a lot)
I care what's better for me
Summer time is so much better for me, it's ridiculous how much of a difference it makes
It fits my natural sleep rhythm better, I can enjoy the sun in the afternoon (which makes me quite depressed during winter times) and I'm much less tired during the day
And yes, it's anecdotal, but most people I know prefer summer time
They enjoy it much more
I even know 3 people who shifted their whole schedule this winter (working from home made it possible) and stayed on summer time since last march
Heard only very positive things from them
And most of Europeans seem to be the same opinion if the last polls are to be believed
I don't fall asleep randomly but I can sleep if I want to even if it's not bedtime and even if I'm not very tired
If I go to bed every time at 11pm I still have no problem going to sleep at 9pm when I need to get up two hours earlier the next day, even though I'm not as tired as I usually am while going to bed
Is that really such an absurd thing for some people
We do not have any active fossil fuel power plants and ~90% of our energy is produced with water
The Austrian Empire along with Prussia were the first countries with mandatory education for children
No matter their sex or social standing
It's one of the reasons Empress Maria Theresia is so well loved in Austria to this day
Austria has one of the oldest civil codes of the world (second only to France if I'm not mistaken)
Austria has the biggest nuclear power plant model in the world
We built a nuclear power plant and didn't turn it on
We have one nuclear power plant, but voted against it‘s activation
One third of our forested lands are protected
We were the first country to strongly reject biotechnology for crops
Every person over the age of 14 is allowed to change their religion without the parents okay
We generate over 70% of our electricity through renewable energy sources
We recycle average 63% of our waste, highest percentage in Europe I believe
> Prison escape is not punishable by law in Germany
Not only in Germany though, I think it's like that in many Civil Law influenced countries
It's the same in Austria, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands, or Mexico
In Mexico officers will shoot at you though
Okay so there is nothing wholesome about germany
Right
Its ridiculous
Although technically speaking, those ginormous halls of capitalism aren't super- but hypermarkets (and even though I hate to admit it, they're incredibly convenient)
I think that only applies to Poles who actually fought in the Haitian War of Independence, not all Poles
That's a wholesome fact if i've ever heard one
That is true
But have you seen French super-/hypermarkets
They are *massive*

In Vienna: [those dudes that stand around in front of the Opera and Stephansdom] badly "dressed up" like Mozart or whatever and aggressively selling "authentic experience" concert tickets for e.g. the Mozart Orchestra for horrendous prices
Lots of people think it's a concert in the opera, when it's really at a random location, with random musicians who play the same 5 pieces every day
Others sell fake tickets
Essentially the look like official vendors because of the uniforms, but really they are black market vendors
If you buy concert tickets, only buy the at the official box office
Or better yet check in the internet on the offical websites of the Opera or the Musikverein etc
The Fiaker carriages in Vienna
Hallstatt
They had put a limit on how many busses are allowed to enter the city per day in 2019 because they have up 900k tourists/year
The town itself has ~750 citizens
We loved the city center but we made sure to sleep and eat just outside of it
The local food (just 15 min walk from the center) was indeed cheap and delicious
Went a few times to praque, but hell yes: cheap beer and the nicest strip bars i‘ve been
Would recommend a rip off 5/7
I agree with Loch Ness, but Edinburgh Castle was really beautiful and worth the visit
I've heard that the Isle of Skye is quite crowded nowadays (before the virus, of course)
There were only a few tourists (mostly from England) when I've been there in 2012
Have been to Rothenburg ob der Tauber with my parents about 30 years ago and I still remember it fondly as being one of the most beautiful towns I have seen in my lifetime
And we have some really nice towns here too in Austria
But Rothenburg
Just wow
Im not a fan of crowded places nor expensive rip offs
But THE oktoberfest is a lasting experience i wouldnt miss
Yes beer and food is expensive, but i usually spend more money for a night in a regular club
So basically the deep frozen paella i can buy in any Austrian supermarket
Which of them woule you recommend
Lots of history happened there, tbh it was kind of worth it
Don't know what a ticket currently costs though
Everyone bitches about Taxi drivers being against Uber, but everyone should be
They pay no taxes and they are horrible for workers
Yes, as a User they are great

But that doesn't make Uber okay
Yeah but it doesn't help that you got the choice between good service which is bad for the driver or bad service which is "good" for the driver
Yeah I know
I spent a semester in Valencia, so I have had my fair share of bad Paellas in overly touristy places

Also, my gf is Basque, and she has a nose (quite literally actually) for bad restaurants
What I learned about Spanish gastronomy, if a place looks a bit old or a bit shabby or cutre (given that it's not completely disgusting ofc), it might have better food than a super fancy polished place with lots of tourists (that is not *always* true, but often)
In my experience that has been true so far in Valencia, Barcelona, Bilbao, Donostia, Malaga, Ronda (best Rabo de Toro I have *ever* had was in a place called Tropicana; looked very cutre from the outside, was quite nice on the inside and has exceptionally good food and service), Granada, Cordoba
I have been to quite shabby places in lots of those cities, and have been served with exquisite menus, with a presentation of a 4-star cook
Thank you
Which also severely hurts the housing market, yes
Let's just allow child labor in coal mines again then
Because people can always just choose right
Jaja que casualidad
He estado allí en diciembre, y Ronda es un sitio muy muy bonito
Fue muy impresionado de todo el pueblo
Pero especialmente del rabo de toro
Child workers in coal mines once were legal just as well
And just like that is illegal now, abusing your workers should be illegal as wiell
And something being technically legal doesn't make it okay anyway
And what Uber does (Scheinselbstständigkeit) is in fact against the law in Austria, it's just that nobody sued them for it yet
I'm bad at beeing Austrian either
I don't ski, I dislike coffee (never drink it), I barely eat cake, I barely go hiking, I barely visit farms, I only speak a bit in dialect and I don't like some of our classic dishes like Germknödel
- I'm nominally Catholic, but only go to church when I visit my parents in Christmas
- I'm really purist when it comes to eating Schnitzel with lingonberry jam
BUT NOTHING ELSE
- I love sausages, Leberkas, pork roast grease on bread
- I prefer alpine over sea salt
- I like skiing
- I'm bad at football
- I watch ski jumping on TV, when it's on
- I occasionally enjoy very sparkling water
- I prefer swimming in an alpine lake over swimming in the sea, although both are cool
- I complain a lot, but do little to actually change things
- I like beer, but sometimes also like wine
Schnaps is also amazing
- I sometimes wear my Lederhose just for fun
E.g. on election day
- I despise nobles and royalty
- I enjoy going hiking, and get uneasy when I find myself in a very flat landscape
- I drink a lot of coffee
- I'm parsimonious
Except when I'm celebrating with friends
- With my peers I'm conflict-shy, do not like direct confrontation and tend to talk around problems rather then addressing them
However I do mouth off strangers sometimes
- I'm polite
- I like eating sweet things and I enjoy baking stuff like Austrian Christmas cookies or Sachertorte
But only if there's enough rum in it
- It takes years of interpersonal relationship until I have the proper intimacy with another person to call them my friend
But then they are my friend until I die
- I code-switch a lot between a deep Upper Austrian dialect, Viennese, Austrian Standard German and anything in between
It depends on the situation
- I sometimes experience a slight subconcious sensation of disgust, when I hear a person from north of the Main-line speak German
I can't help it, this prejudice is so deep inside of me
I'm trying not to be so judgemental about it
I like coffee, I like complaining about everything and my humor is dark
Am I Austrian enough
Not really, no
I can't yodel and I've never worn our traditional costume
I don't ski or do any other winter sports, and I don't go hiking
I don't like Schnitzel or beer or Red Bull
Kaiserschmarrn and Topfenstrudel are great
>"Polack" is, indeed, used as a derogatory term
I have seen "poorlack" used as an even more derogatory term
While eating nothing but amphetamines and pine buds for a week
Ever heard of a movie called "The Sound Of Music"? I sure didn' til I was 25
On the spot, I can't really think of one where the country of Austria was depicted, but back in like 2016 or so when that Krampus Horror movie came out
oh boy
They got pretty much everything about it wrong to make it fit with the american version of christmas
> to meet the "Basque terrorists" who live surrounded by bananas
Who are also all Mexicans of course, but wearing txapelas, and for some reason they can't cook (which for a Basque must be very insulting)
Well, the US ending with the 2 dudes in „Love, actually“ was probably even more more cringy for Americans than it was for me
Romania should be relieved that the romanian village from borat is portrayed as kazachstan
I liked the episode of the Gilmore Girls, where Rory's rich grandparents have some guests over from the Netherlands, a young girl and an older gentleman I think, and they don't speak a single word of English
As if any upper class Dutch person wouldn't at least a passable amount of English
They could have made them French at least, that would have made more sense
But Dutch
I didn't really get the joke in the scene with Heidi Klum (watched it in English), but maybe this is due to the fact that it is produced for an American audience
Love the impression of the german baddies from pitch perfect 2
they actors are swedish
I dont get why they didnt just get generic germans at least
I thought that scene was super hilarious, with the Red Army Choir in the background and all
Especially because it has the "every Russian guy ever"-actor who is actually from Croatia or so in it
Ah yes, the mighty Alps in Finland
>  or the red and white checkered tablecloth (which frankly I've never seen in my 30 years of existence)
The Neapolitian Pizzeria around my corner has tablecloths like that
Made of plastic of course
And before you ask, yes, it's an *actual* Neapolitan Pizzeria
The family who owns it, is from downtown Naples, and the father was a Carabinieri there for 30 years, and they barely speak anything other than Neapolitan
They even have this weird white clown with the black mask and the guitar sitting on a counter
> I'd like to add Woody Allen's "To Rome with Love", which is a short summary of all stereotypes Americans have on Italy
All of Woody Allen's "European movies" are just long chains of American clichés, and the protagonists are always unbearably snobbish and stuck up upper class Americans from the Upper East side or whatever, who can't deal with the "passion" of their European counterparts
Vicky Christina Barcelona is probably the worst in that sense
It's just a terrible terrible film
Midnight in Paris at least has a creative story and a good message (nostalgia is overrated; kinda ironic coming from Woody Allen, I know)
To Rome with Love, I think, had its funny moments, because it's quite bizzarre in the way the stories are told
I loved the "shower singer" (money destroys the soul of art), and the Roberto Benigni storyline (fame is temporary)
And Alec Baldwin basically trying and failing to convince his younger self that cheating on his girlfriend with Ellen Page is a terrible idea is also very funny
Sense8 has a pretty good international cast, because - shocker - they use actors from tze country they were portraying
And they portrayed the german characters pretty well imo
Jsyk, there's *lots* of unneccessary sex scenes in that show
Based
Also, I love that TV show on eitb where they talk about movies
You always learn something new
Maybe it has also to do with the fact that Heidi Klum is a very unfunny person
> the only other time i can think of where austria was in a big movie was in mission impossible
I can think of at least 2 James Bond movies in Austria, I am pretty sure there are many more
Don't forget The Third Man and Before Sunrise
well he's a jew, so duh
Wasn't the end scene in Grindelwald supposed to be in austria
True
Except for the TV
Almost nobody here had a TV in the 50s.
So I re-watched the scene on [YouTube]
Heidi Klum says that the "yips" is called in German "Ach du meine Güte, nichts klappt mehr, aber überhaupt nichts mehr" (followed by something incomprehensible where I am not sure if it is German or English)
So I think the joke should be that German has rather long words, but this is actually a sentence (something like "Oh my goodness, nothing works anymore, nothing at all
Also this response makes no sense for a German speaker
I only know that a lot were filmed in Vienna, but are supposed to be set in Hungary or Checoslovakia, probably because during the cold war it was the closest location without entering the eastern block
EDIT : I did a bit of digging and the only one I could find was The living daylights
Before Sunrise was pretty accurate for Vienna I think
Except for a few movie cliches I don’t remember any cringy moments
The Third Man is an absolute gem and uses accurate Viennese music
The zither player Anton Karas actually reached the top of the billboard charts I think, and he did a world tour after becoming famous with that movie
Yes it's a Pulcinella
It's because they're homesick, I'm pretty sure
It's not placed super prominently
Neither is their SS Napoli scarf
Anyway, yeah I get your drift
Also, fyi, in Austria lots of places also use that kind of tablecloth, so the association is
well, weak
Also, – not that you were asking – in my opinion it actually is the best Pizza in town, but I literally live around the corner and eat their food about once a week, so maybe I'm a bit biased
They are like theme park rides
It's good fun, flashy, and you don't have to think too much about it
Just enjoy awesome explosions and stuff
It also uses accurate Viennese language:
[Nothing more Viennese than someone shouting out of a window and complaining about noise
My  history teacher in highschool was certain that the reason for the smear campaign on the former austrian president Kurt Waldheim was that Austria decided to help Nicaragua against the will of the Usa
But the  movement, it's arguments and the science behind it would still be valid, no
>I love that one, because if it was true, we'd have gotten really shit at that, given that one of our biggest historic rivals (France) has similar, arguably more, influence than us
France doesn't come close to the internal power Germany has in the EU
France is only very influential in foreign matters
Yeah the Us is a pretty easy target for conspiracy theorists
Cause they don’t get some ?
My handwriting is so bad that it usually becomes an “e”
There are 2 different a's in the bottom example
(in Baruch it's different than in Bernard)
Part of another
Can't think of a neighboring country we don't joke about reclaiming in it's entirety or at least partly
We don‘t joke about that: Dear Italians, we want our South Tyrol back :l
Yeah, many joke about taking back Südtirol, a state in Italy that still to this day has a german speaking majority in almost all of it, despite attempts of "italianization" by Mussolini
Low-key kinda salty still
Weren't these just pranksters in their own free time
:-O
You sure that everyone knows that those are jokes
Haven‘t seen somebody talk about conquering our swiss and liechtensteiner friends yet tho
You‘d rather shove Bavaria over to us lol
Not even the Rhine border
Come on, you can do better than just keeping Alsace
You can pull off a sneaky Kosovo if you're lucky
AEIOU
It's inevitable
Too late, Wilhelm and I are getting the old gang back together
I do too, North Sea Empire sounds way more epic than England and Norway
Stay safe brother
If you don't mind me asking, did you migrate to Belarus for work related reasons
Really appreciate the answer
I'm very curious about stuff like this because people don't just leave their home without a good reason usually
Hope you're doing well and that you guys can find some peace and safety
Edit: And on top of that I've never talked to anyone from Murmansk Oblast before so that's kinda rare also
I mean revolutions probably *are* kinda hard to win
That there are no unions, and its portrayed as being something special and extra if there is one
In austria basically every job is unionized, why isnt in the US
Not including taxes in the prices in a grocery store
(And no, "taxes are different from state to state or even in different cities in one state" doesn't make sense as an excuse
The grocery store doesn't move between states or cities)
No proper lighting (ceiling lights) in living rooms
Carpets
even in public places and offices
The imperial system
Letting private companies run things the state should do
(Like prisons)
Why they elected that clown
mixing sports with military propaganda
I just want to watch NBA, not join the Marines
The lack of Romeo and Juliet laws in many states
A 18 year old from my country was charged for having consensual sex with a 17 year old girl in the US
It's beyond stupid and quite archaic
That the same people who fight for "small government" and don't trust that the government can do anything right want that same state have the right to kill people
The list is long but probably the weirdest to me are:
The imperial system
The obsession with guns
Drinking age
Weird attitude towards sex & nudity
The fact that it's pretty much a consensus among Americans that the USA is the greatest country on earth when it's clearly not the case
>  In austria basically every job is unionized
Since recently even bicycle food couriers have a union
Which I think is great
Gig economy jobs are eroding worker's rights, and it's important that unions keep up with that
And showing prices before taxes
It's not even really an issue actually, if there wasn't this one big misunderstanding: People keep saying "I'm Irish" when they actually mean "I have Irish heritage", because you're used to talking about heritage over there
Nobody has anything against this, and people would even be happy to see that you're so in touch with where you came from (and what you *think* it means to come from there)
But tragically, over here, because we're used to talking about nationality instead, that same sentence would be understood as "I have Irish *nationality*", which is of course a nonsensical statement to begin with, and can feel belittling and insensitive, as if who we *are* was just an amusement park theme to you, something to consumed and put on baseball hats
In short, saying "I have x heritage" is fine
Saying "I am x" is not fine, because it will be understood as "I have x nationality".
oh, they do now
that's good news, especially the "fake" one-person entrepreneurs (that are actually contract workers) need those
We call it toast
Even before toasting it
Never really thought of it as bread to be honest
Related to bread but not really bread bread
It was popularized by American businessman after WW2 and is a supermarket staple
Well, the far right in Austria (FPOE with Strache) didn't come close to 50%. In the last election they had 16% and before that 26%.
But politics completely aside, Strache and Kurz are much more intelligent than Trump
They are also able to form coherent sentences, remember things, read, keep their attention up for more than a few minutes,...
I mean just this statement alone, even without context:
>The president of the United States has the authority to do what the president has the authority to do, which is very powerful
> we’re overall fairly normal in regards to religion worldwide
How many western states have opening prayers in sessions of parts of the government
Americans always act surprised when I say I eat a whole pizza
Yes they have a Kollektivvertrag now
[Check this link for more info]
over here it would honestly be seen as rude
visit my house, take your shoes off dammit
> You can have the same store in different counties (subset of states) and can have different taxes
But the one store I'm physically in is only in one state and one county, even if that chain has stores in different states
They know the tax since they charge it at the checkout
They could, without problems, put that on the price tag
"it happen still signs and wonders", that's nice to hear
In Austria we call that being Catholic
In all seriousness, we do actually have a word for it, "Taufscheinchristen" or "Taufscheinkatholiken", i.e. "Baptism certificate Christians/Catholics".
>  In Europe it’s more about forcibly separating religion from the government and all public life in some cases
In Europe, at least my country, it's removing the influence of religion and church from everyday matter
That's the main point, not the other way round
Given that your concern is that the government is influencing religion and not the other way round kinda proofs my point
The problem I've got with religion in the US is that churches and religions have a huge influence on for example laws, which just shouldn't be the case
>I also find it weird here in Germany too that there’s an official church tax,
Well, it's basically a membership fee, it's just handled like a tax since the amount you pay is based on how much your wage is so this way it's easier
If you aren't a member of a religious denomination you don't have to pay
But I agree, every special treatment of religion and churches should be banned
>and the biggest political party is a Christian Democrat party
And yet you seem to hear more religious phrases from Republicans than from CDU politicians
Trump tweeted "God Bless the USA
" a month ago, now try find a statement from Merkel along those lines
You can get up to three days for death of family members/funerals, your partner giving birth, weddings, and moving house
We don't have it written in law either, but it's in the *Kollektivvertrag*, which is binding for employers and employees
the way the Austrian system works - it's basically law
There might be differences depending on in which sector (= under which collective agreement) you are working
For example I have Christmas & New Year the whole day off; in my previous job with an different collective agreement it was only half the day
Also, we have unlimited paid sick leave which is apparently not standard in all countries
Was that pun intended
Ganz in Austria is a really beautiful City
Most tourists only visit Vienna and Salzburg
They are also really beautiful city's, but overrun by tourists
Last year I visited Graz the first time and was flabbergasted
It's a nice rennesaince town with lots of history and a nice nightlife
Rattenberg
With a population of 400 or so I don‘t think many Austrians even know it‘s a city
I'd say Klagenfurt
It gets a bad rep because it is the capital of the former most right-wing federal state and many move away from there after school because admittedly it does not have a lot to offer to young people living there
However, it's located next to a big, gorgeous lake, there are a ton of things to do as a tourist in the surrounding area and it has a statue of a Dragon on its main square
Bonus: Trieste and Ljubljana are so close that you can visit them in a day trip from there
Braunau
There is no Braunau, there never was something called Braunau
Nobody was ever born in Braunau
Don't ever ask again about Braunau
I believe it‘s very unknown outside of Austria and Styria but Bad Kleinkirchheim
It‘s a very beautiful city for skiing holiday and around here also very popular for that exact reason
Personally, it‘s really my favorite place for skiing
Other than that one no city really comes to my mind that is unknown by tourists
It is
I had my holiday 2 years ago near Siena
I was in Florence and Pisa but Siena was my favourite
To me Rauchbeer tastes as if someone put smoked ham in a keg of beer for a week or so, then washed a couple of old crusty ashtrays in the resulting liquid before finally putting it in a glass in order for me to drink it ;)
But to each his own I guess ;)
I like how you misspelled it in the first mention, so that people won't find it
That's you keep a secret
Right
I loved Graz
It was easy the best homecation we ever had
Pretty much like a smaller and more accessible version of Vienna that has better infrastructure
Source: Living in Vienna and am to Graz every year
Vienna isn’t a bad city either tho
Oh, I agree
I was to Klagenfurt a few years ago and it was really nice
They just have everything there
There’s also mountains that are near the city and easily accessible and I’m just a real mountain fan
And don't ask questions about the new police station
It has always been there, no one of any significance lived in that house
Hah my brain is still in sleep mode, I live in vienna and as Basti said, we don't get up before 12
Completely missed your reply
yes, I tasted it, not a fan ;)
"Eventually" and the German word "eventuell" are false friends
"Eventuell" translates to "possibly". That's still something I have to actively think about when I'm reading a text in English
One interesting German word is "arm", meaning poor but then you have "arm" in English which means the body part
We also have Arme (arms) and Armee (army) but I see where the connection is in this case
I'm not sure if this counts but in Serbian and other South Slavic languages we have "Nocna Mora" (nightmare) and in German it's called Nachtmahr
The English word nightmare sounds similar
In German we also have Albtraum which is frequently used
It's a very specific term
Don't know why those words evolved similar
Gift in German means Poison, in English it of course means „present“.
A funny one is "Hatsch" which sounds like "Hadj" and means a long exhausting (and sometimes senseless) walk
Fun story from my childhood
We were all playing yu-gi-oh and German and English cards were both common
I don't remember which card and how it's special effect was exactly but it was something like "if this is the only bug type card its Attack becomes 1000". We read it as "its Attack increases by 1000". The base attack of the card was 2000 so by our rules the monster's attack was 3000 if it was the only bug type card on the field
When we learned what become really means, the card became (ha
)much less popular
TIL that the widely used Austrian word "Bussi" also exists in Hungarian with the exact same meaning
Like how you say "Johannes" in German sometimes
Based on the saying "Wie die Nase eines Mannes, so ist auch sein Johannes".
In German, the bird is called "Storch". Strong means "Stark".
Not sure, I know that the term is very old and used by older people
my english teacher always told that joke, nice memories tho, now he is dead due to his weight
Well that escalated quickly
Any Moldovans here
I would be curious to know how they relate to Romanian or even Russian news
As an Austrian I have no problems about hearing news about our little neighbour Germany
It´s like with all kids, at a certain time of your life you have to let them make their own mistakes and learn from them
We did our best to raise them and they can come back for a short visit from time to time, but there is no way, they are going to move back in again
;-)
Not really if you don't watch German TV or read German news
Austrian TV and news don't mention a lot of German news unless its something really big happening
Much more about the US than Germany
Our destinctive dialetcs in Austria seem to fade because of the german media that overwhelms us
We get some news from Germany, but it's nowhere near overwhelming
After all, Germany is our biggest neighbor, so keeping up with the situation there isn't a bad thing imo
But you hear much more about Germany than about Italy, for example
In which part do you live
I live near Slovenia and barely get german related news
And I don‘t think the Styrian dialect will fade _that_ easily (but I have noticed that Upper and Lower Austrian dialects slowly (kinda) fade)
Some might say we lost the war, others might say we got rid of a problem
;-)
Yes, they are our most dominant neighbour
But it‘s not as overwhelming as US politics often are
Some do some don‘t. I don't think many people care alot about him
Yes
He was interview by the public broacaster a while ago (he had organized an exhibition in Austria), and the interview was controversial enough for the public broadcaster to immediately distance itself from Böhmermann's statements
[Link]
Vienna
I think there is a tendency for more multicultural areas to loose their dialect more quickly
Oh /: yeah, here the people who aren‘t from around here will adopt our dialect
Eg a brazilian friend of mine already speaks in full on dialect, my polish mom can‘t even speak properly standard german, because she only knows our dialect
Always these rebellious teenagers with their bad music
That german teenager brat is acting up again, it appears
Time for another Cordoba
brb, need to listen to the Radetzky march
There actually is
Pretty much all music from Beethoven
Everyone considers him Austrian besides him being from Bonn
That is our ultimate victory
We made Hitler German and Beethoven Austrian
Well, those people might also even eat their "Schnitzel" with Tunke
So their opinion doesn´t count as they are barbarians
You know
, like the ones who eat "Jägerschnitzel". ;-)
You should stick to the pinnacle of German cousine: Döner and Currywurst and leave good food to the people like us
Saupreiß, damischer
;-)
A nordic state for sure
Once global warming hits hard that'll be the only places still suitable for human life
Either Faroe Islands or Svalbard
The Netherlands
I'm already learning dutch (but haven't studied since a few months due I'm also learning cebuano and this language has more priority in my life rn)
And it might be weird as an Austrian saying I prefer more like not mountainous countries and places (even you have spectacular views on a mountain)
Iceland or Norway
Although English would work just fine there
I like how u listed every germanic country except Austria
And a landscape flatter then ...
Seriously i can't even find something else that is that flat
I'm always assuming people speak German - GERMANS are literally everywhere
In Austria there are a lot of German and French decks
I have seen one of these Spanish decks once
They remind me of what we in Austria use for the game of [Schnapsen] The symbols are totally different, though
In Austria in some regions we use Doppeldeutsche Karten which would translate to "double german cards". It doesn't surprise me at all that other countries have other decks too
Edit: [here's] a picture of a deck
They are from an Austro-Hungarian game, so you are correct in calling them that
Yes, it's a grandparent's game here as well
Let's just say I was happy when my grandma's license was taken away because she certainly was a great danger to herself and others
Sure, it sucks for her to be dependant on others driving her and using public transport but she would have killed herself or someone else in traffic at some point
Too bad she had to total her car (luckily nobody seriously hurt) before
Yes, I think people should prove they are still able to drive every 5 year after retirement
If they fail then maybe give them free ticket for public transport
once you're 60, mandatory driving tests every 5 years, bam
I'd say 50, but if its 60 you'll probably only have to do one during your working time, and will have enough time to do the following ones once you're retired
also makes sense to force people to update their knowledge on driving techniques and new laws, 40 years of "that's how I've learned it and how I've always done it" are another problem that needs to be fixed probably better sooner than later
Do the math, if she doesn't go somewhere daily, and/or only over short distances, even taxis are cheaper than the all-in price of a car (buying price, insurance, repairs, gas, ...)
And most taxi drivers even will carry your groceries in if you ask nicely and give them a little tip
quoting myself ...
> and/or only over short distances
if you live somewhere in the country side it's a different topic of course
> 20 minutes to the city
That's literally country side / tiny village stuff
If you are not _in_ a city you are rural
No matter how close the city might be (and 20 minutes by car is not that close)
Usually something below 10-7 degrees is jacket weather for me, but it depends if it's windy
I d say below 10 is cool, below 0 is cold
Below 10 and rainy is just miserable
5°C can be extremely cold and -5°C can be comfortable depending on wind and humidity
Below ~18 I take a vest with me and wear long pants
Below ~10 i use my jacket (not very thick
Below ~0 I take a thicker jacket
And maybe gloves
But it always depends on the situation
If its snowy I will take different shoes, if its raining I take a rain jacket
And if its much colder I consider taking another jacket
Below 20 I wear a hoodie, Below 15 a thin jacket, between 10 and 15 a thicker jacket, below 10 a coat, around zero an even thicker/bigger coat Everything below is death to me
-10° seems ok-cold to me, everything below isn‘t really for me
My room temperature is 18°
European, Home and the European Union, if you want to count that as one word
If not, the next in line would be History
The Colosseum (in Rome), the EU flag and a Plaza (as in with cafes  and outdoor seating)
A map of it with the most of them labeled
And if I should think of words:
- countries
- languages
- beach
You are true with Christianity, but for me they are away far from Europe (geographically and culturally)
I always include the Northern Caucasus in Europe's boundaries - Caucasus makes a great barrier, as thr sea (yes I know Ural is not really a good boundary)
For me from iceland to the Ural mountains, excluding kazakhstan, to the caspian sea,including the 3 caucasus nations, excluding turkish parts in europe, but including cyprus
South to Malta and west to Portugal
Same here, plus this feeling of home that many here described
You include the Caucasus but not Turkey
Yes
For example: Georgia is one of the oldest european/christian civilizations
'dicke Eier' haben = having fat balls means to be horny for some time already without getting any release
Word by word translated „to have big balls“ means to have big sport balls or something like that lol
that is just to have balls though, no
'Er hat (nicht) die Eier dazu' No comment on how big they are :D
Since words that start with 'th' are old English words these words are usually (always
) the same
dünn=thin, thanks=Danke, think=denken, etc
Oh well, then it is a regional thing :) here it is not possible
it is
Come to Bang for the buck austria ;)
6 is pretty ironic rn
> / 6
That leaves, say, 80% of $91
2 million or $72
9 million
> Here is where things start to get less clear
Personally, I think you should dump half of this, or $36
4 million, into a boring S&P 500 index fund
Find something with low fees
You are going to be constantly tempted to retain "sophisticated" advisers who charge "nominal fees
" Don't. Period
Even if you lose every other dime, you have $638,400 per year you didn't have before that will keep coming in until the United States falls into chaos
Fuck advisers and their fees
Instead, drop your $36
4 million in the market in a low fee vehicle
**Unless we have an unprecedented downturn the likes of which the United States has never seen**, should return around 7
00% or so over the next 10 years
You should expect to touch not even a dime of this money for 10 or 15 or even 20 years
In 20 years $36
4 million could easily become $115 million
Emphasis mine
> San Sebastian
I'd totally buy myself a beachfront penthouse in Gros, next to Zurriola, and eat pintxos every day until I die
I can't think of anything than Petrol which is cheaper here than in Germany
Immobilia maybe too as Germany zonening law is a bit stricter than ours
Rich people can't afford a private jet, you need to be super rich to afford that (in a sustainable way)
Probably the St Gotthart tunnel
Public transport and petrol are the two things
Public transport, internet, mobile contracts, television
Tbh, the bit about treasury bonds is even more valid now than when that post was written
But yeah, generally good advice, except for the timing right now
Sad but true
I'm pretty fucking positive your average Swiss *can't* afford to travel by private jet
I have never voted for a lesser evil and I have never regretted a vote
I can‘t yet vote (next year tho), and honestly, I have two parties I can vote for
One where students and education is their main priority (and I‘m a student) and the other one just because they aren‘t homophobic at all
(Both aren‘t, but there are the other two really big parties that are pretty homophobic in my book
) So yeah, that‘s that, there‘s really not much I can choose from
I voted in my life 4 times until now and I always did it with the belive I vote for the candiate/party which is quite close to my interests
The election were on European, national and regional level
Only found the statistics separately so:
* Male smokers above the age of 15: 18
* Male smokers aged 10 - 14: 2
81%
* Male deaths caused by smoking in 2016: 16
73%
* Female smokers above the age of 15: 15
* Female smokers aged 10 - 14: 3
51%
* Female deaths caused by smoking in 2016: 8
(death statistics are from 2016, smoking statistics are from 2015)
Honestly, almost everybody around here smokes
We’re even called the ash tray of europe
I hate it
Since November there‘s a new rule that you can‘t smoke in closed off public places (restaurant etc), and I love that rule
Everybody disliked it at first because „oh my, **I** don‘t care if anybody around me smokes“ (not really caring about the kids 10 and below having to endure smokers blowing their smoke into their faces
I almost suffocate(d) when my dad did that back then because he either was an asshole or „just for jokes“.) but now it‘s gotten better and nobody complains anymore (:
And i thought having restaurants first build an extra smokers room and then banning that later on was just the austrian solution
Yeah I remember that
For us down here it didn‘t do anything tho except that some people now have little cases for their cigarettes so they don‘t have to look at the diseases or sometimes corpses
Since when are cigarettes expensive in Germany
Was there just last summer and a pack of 20 is like 6€ that's actually cheap compared to many other countries
I also just learned that apparently Austria only banned it with November last year
Weird that we were so late though
My wife is Austrian and all of her family lives here
We met while she was working in America (she had a 2 year work visa) and we agreed that after those two year that we would live in Austria for 2 years then decide from there where we would live permanently
It’s been about 7 years that I’ve lived here
We live out in the western part of the country in the Alps so scenery is amazing
I can see snow capped mountains and a 800 year old castle from my apartment balcony
Overall I prefer it in Austria
I enjoy the lifestyle, security, and work/private life balance here so much more than in America
I also find it a much better place to raise a family (I have a kid and another on the way) which is why I plan to stay here for a while
There are a lot of things that I do miss about America and American life, but when I look at everything, for me and my family, it is better here
I am interested, what are some things you miss
Are they things that could fit into the Austrian lifestyle
I'm glad you like it :)
Well I miss my family and friends greatly
I get to see my parents twice a year and my brother and all my friends maybe once a year
Things like holidays, birthdays, weddings I miss because I’m here
Language is also another thing I miss
I am decent in German and can hold a conversation without much problem, but it’s really hard for me to be funny or to understand jokes
So a lot of my life is rather boring
Making friends here is tough, especially since I’m a bit older (mid 30’s)
Most people here have had the same social group forever and aren’t too welcoming to having new people join in
I have a group of people I hang out with, but it would be nice to have some more friends
Some of my hobbies from America just are not possible here as of now
I always had a fun second car that was a weekend toy in America
Due to costs that just isn’t possible here
Maybe in the future, but with a second kid coming soon it won’t be for a while
I grew up/lived near NYC when I was in America
Damn I miss that city
Things like food that I missed I was able to figure out a way to cook them here as good as possible
Although it is always a treat when I fly over to get the real thing
For friends I could recommend joining a club depending on your interests
People are much more open to you if you do sports together regularly
If you live in a village you could join up with the voluntary fire brigade or local church group as they all organise a lot of events to meet new people
What
I know plenty of guys with multiple cars
Usually it's a daily driver and a sporty old car
I'd say it's actually quite common in young men without kids
>it's shitty for the environment
Not at all, unless you buy new
Not at all
They are all young guys (<26) who took up blue collar jobs
Cars don't have to be expensive
Just buy a cheap old sporty car and do most of the work on your own
Also in Austria you can share insurance for multiple cars
Calling us German
I don't really care personally even though I don't see us as Germans either
Putting sauce on a schnitzel
That's just disgusting
- thinking we're German
- thinking we're Australia
- many petty food elitism memes, like complaining about people who put sauce on their Schnitzel
Austrian redditors act similarly whenever Schnitzel is brought up, and god beware if there's any sauce near that Schnitzel
You should create a sub for it to organize yourself
With r/Schnitzelverbrechen we managed to catch way more heretics than before
Why danes
Pilsner is Czech, which underlines your point perfectly
So basically you were 3 immigrants in a foreign country and one of you got upset over being called an immigrant
Sounds like a Monty Python sketch or something
I've spent a few weeks in Spain before coming to Portugal last year
I had a hard time using the right word, but the locals were very friendly when they corrected me
Wars have been started for lesser offences
That's such a typical Alman thing to say
There's a weekly exchange between both their post companies
Nope
Scandinavia are Sweden, Norway, Denmark
Nordic countries are Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland
In English Scandinavia and Nordic are often used synonymous
In Scandinavia those are strictly not synonymous
Geographically speaking, Finland is not located on the Scandinavian Peninsula
¡Que viven los gabachos
Que viven, ¡en la mierda
It's not like we had much of a choice in that - it was the Allies who pushed for a distinct Austrian national identity in our occupation time, for obvious reasons
And it *does* kind of make sense to have a distinct national identity, considering we are closer in pretty much anything but language to (for instance) Czechs or Slovenians than most parts of Germany ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
> their entire national identity is "not being German"
I see, you have truly grasped the concept of Austrianness
same in austria "so you are basically bavaria, right
" or one simple "australia
which are a different dish and, most importantly, don't have a breaded crust
maybe you guys will learn someday
Because only monsters prefer soggy sad heap of breadcrumbs to a perfectly crispy outer layer
A good schnitzel doesn't need any sauce
AEIOU
Because we're not savages
Do they have it with sauce
Impossible
That's just not done, unless you have only ever eaten in bad tourist traps catering to Germans
As mentioned by someone else, Preiselbeeren are the only thing you could possibly refer to, but that's more like a chunky jam on the side, not a creamy gravy all over the Schnitzel
What they probably meant is lingonberry jam, which is a common and delicious side dish for Schnitzel
But sauce, impossible
It's a German beer sort as much as it's Czech
The city of Pilsen (where it was invented) is in Czechia in any case
Nation of Bavaria and Tyrol when
The only acceptable variation is **Jägerschnitzel** (fr
*Escalope chasseur*) with mushroom and cream sauce
It is NOT supposed to be breaded - everyone who pours sauce over a breaded schnitzel can go die in a hole
Hot Take: Serbo-Croatian is one language
Those countries are closer to most of Austria in culture/mentality than basically all of Germany besides Bavaria
We are more Slavic influenced than people might think
Language isn't everything
It’s war, then
Press F for all of our sad Schnitzel brothers
that sounds like the steak-schnitzel i saw in a german video
the steak was medium rare, complete opposite of schnitzel masterrace
In everyday speech, "Schnitzel" exclusively refers to Wiener Schnitzel
A ketchup am lewakas bringt doch erst den flavor ausse
A lewakassemmal ohne am ketchup is traurig
A trockenes Fleischlaberlsemmerl
Grauslig
Nah that's fine
Sounds good, Austria approves
Tbh, and don't tell anyone I told you, but the cotoletta milanese is the original Schnitzel anyway
Very rarely you can order a Mailänder Schnitzel here, with parmesan in the crust, but I don't actually know whether that's what an original milanese is
Oh yeah that's a Schnitzelsemmel, that's fine
The bread can be a tad dry without
Aaaah okay
Schnitzelsemmel
The bread roll is called Kaisersemmel
That's a completely different thing
It's basically fast food, so some people eat it with ketchup
A Fotzn kaunst hobn
Kaslewakas mit Mayonäs, *des* is da Hit
Food, architecture and history are obvious examples
I'd feel much more foreign in Hamburg than Prague for instance
I agree with the Fotzn, oba Mayonnaise
An Siasn und a Essiggurkal
Yeah it's still a Schnitzel
What was the name of the place
Was it "Schnitzel Kebab König", "Schnitzel Kebab Pizza", "Kebab Pizza Schnitzel", or "Pizza Schnitzel Kebab"? It's always one of those
Prague was also for a long time during the holy roman empire the capital of the Habsburg's since the Kingdom of Bohemia was in the HRE and was a kingdom in comparison to Austria proper which was "only" and archduchy
>i am honestly sorry that i can't wrap my head around Austrians not being a German people when for centuries the emperor of the HRE was sitting in Vienna
If I travel 200 miles in any direction from my city i will meet people speaking about 5 different languages but they will all be rather similar in mindset as they come from the Alpine region of central Europe
I understand what you mean, but  the Holy Roman Emperor sat in Prague for a while as well for instance
And as an Eastern Austrian I don't even see myself as a part of Alpine Central Europe either ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Some time last year I discovered that our national public service broadcaster (ORF) is providing news in [several languages] Mostly languages that were spoken in the former empire
Since very recently (probably because of the pandemic) they have an [instagram account] that provides news in Hungarian, Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian, Czech, Slovenian, English, Turkish, Arabic, Farsi and Austrian sign language
After the crisis
EU: threatens to sanction hungary to get rid of hungarian dictatorship
Karl from habsburg: restores austria-hungary to get rid of hungarian dictatorship
EU: what the fuck
Austria: what the fuck
Hungary: confused relieve
Karl from habsburg: haters gona hate
You either have some very bad sources or are intentionally lying to make Germany look better
>Germany has by far the most ICUs (Intensive Care Units/Critical Care Beds) per capita in Europe
Germany's 29
2 isn't "far more" than Luxembourg's 24
8 or Austria's 21
> followed by Italy on second place with 12
5 and France on third place 11
Hungary, the Baltic countries, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria are all above Italy and France
Luxemburg has actually the second most in the with 24
8 per 100
000 inhabitants and Austria is third with 21
8 per 100
000 inhabitants
You can get a country flair on the right
Oh god, please let it be any other Habsburg/Hohenberg and not Karl
Cannot stand the guy
*breathes heavily in Austro-Hungarian”
Huh, didn't know that Inzko still has the job
Is there no term limit
> Austria is basically Germany
This is SO wrong
It's like I would say Portugal is basically Spain
First, I highly doubt that Turkey has a healthcare systems thats miles ahead of the western world
You either linked me a wrong source or the Wikipedia entry is outright wrong
24k beds for 80 million citizens doesn't add up to 47
1 per 100
000 inhabitants
It was a joke oida
Definitely not that high
Maybe 10-20% or so
I would estimate the % of men sunbathing topless well above 90% though
Vienna at the Donau
quite a lot - otherwise not so much
For my country - Austria - I haven‘t ever seen this
We do however have nude besches and it is not illegal or something - I‘d say maybe 2-7% do it here
Totally depends on the area
In designated FKK areas, everybody
In areas that are not, I'd say it's 5 out of a 100 maybe
20 years ago maybe
Much lower now
Don't forget that this drops to <divide by zero exception>% at all the austrian sea-beaches
Yeah seems to o go down all the time
Austrian salary:
> A person working in Vienna typically earns around 4,530 EUR per month
Salaries range from 1,150 EUR (lowest average) to 20,200 EUR (highest average, actual maximum salary is higher)
This is the average monthly salary including housing, transport, and other benefits
The lowest two Lego sets I found on the offical Lego website are about 79,99€ (a Fiat-car-thingy / I‘m no good with cars, it was just a car and I think it was labeled as a Fiat >.<), and a Jungle Rescue Mission thingy for the same price
The highest I found was the Millenium Falcon for 799,99€. I‘d say the average is 199,99€ for a full set (aka most of them cost 199,99€)
Much higher household capital though than Germany in Italy
If you’d be living in my home for a prolonged time, meaning to be probably alone with my stuff and have theoretically access to my most private documents etc
and/or if I’d have kids in the house like that family likely did I would ABSOLUTELY google you/demand a background check with the institution placing you in my home
I mean, come on
That’s just common sense
Bringing your deceased parent up left field is a bit  much German Direktheit though
Wouldn’t do that
And so is straight out telling you
That’s actually a very nice and transparent move
Personally I wouldn’t tell
> 1) why did they google my name
I’ve never googled names of anyone I personally know, and expect the same of others
Is this normal behavior for a host family in Europe
You never googled anyone you haven't met yet but are going to meet
I don't see anything wrong with it especially if it's about letting someone stay at your place
The second part is a very subjective thing
Could be that you understood the situation wrong, or that it's a different in culture, or that they behaved in a strange way
No way of telling without knowing both sides of the story
>1) why did they google my name
Why not
> 2) even after googling my name, why would they tell me what they did
Can I attribute it to the “bluntness” of the culture
If I ever googled someone, I’d be embarrassed to tell them as it feels like an invasion of privacy (example: court records will appear in google searches)
This family announced it to the group like it was just a normal thing for them to
To bring stuff like that up in a conversation first thing seems rather untactful
But I don't feel like googling someone is invasion of privacy
Courts putting records online is invasion of privacy
I'm currently looking for roommates (via online platforms and groups) and I try to find out basic information about them if they don't write much about themselves in their advertisement
Like, what do they do for a living
What are their hobbies and interests
What are their views about topics like politics, morals, other beliefs and perspectives
Of course, a roommate and a host family is a bit different, but basically it's the fastest way to find our what kind of person you will share your home with
That's really important
For example, imagine someone is gay and their host family is homophobic
Or if someone's wearing a hijab and the future roommate turns out to be someone who hates muslims
Extreme examples, I know, but I guess you get the point
Googling someone in general is not an invasion of privacy, in my opinion
Most people will stop after the first page of google results, or maybe after checking social media
That usually tells you enough, and that's usually stuff that's shared online by the person voluntarily
However, the way they brought it up is NOT okay
That has nothing to do with being blunt, that's just awful behaviour
Sorry you had to experience that
I would probably do a small Google background check
I think that's not uncommon
I would not bring it up, or confront you with the results, though (unless something very out of the ordinary came up)
That strikes me as a bit odd
We are usually very protective about our privacy
Nope it's totally weird, sorry that happened to you
I mean that's your opinion
I see it differently, especially if it's in some kind of business context
I also have absolutely no problems with people googling me and I can totally understand if for example a AirBNB or couch surfing host does it before accepting my request
Old English is very close to old German, therefore I can understand quite a lot :)
I guess "doubt the equivocation of the fiend" means "don't believe the lies of the devil".
Well, I did have courses in university that included the Hildebrandslied
So I guess I have a bit of advantage here, its been a long time though
Well I guess Krampus would fall under interesting story
It was a celtic thing back in the day
Something about evil spirits and good luck for the winter
(Not sure on the exact things it was supposed to do) Well the catholic church didn't like the tradition and tried to banish it
However it was to popular and they couldn't do much
So they added saint nicholas to it and made it somewhat christian
The tradition is still very strong, however mostly in the valleys
In the cities it's just a big show
Now where I am from a pass (the group) consists of 3-6 Krampus (they were pelts so they look and big wooden masks and big bells on the back,  ) one Körbelträger(guy who caries a big basket with trests on his back, is cover in black color(not about race, more about the woods) moss and other things) one Angel and one saint nicholas
Typically the groups just move from house to house in my town on the 5th of December
Nicholas and the guy with the basket + the angel enter the home first
The nicholas gives a small speech and then children say poems they rehearsed
As a reward bad of treats(clementine, peanuts, cookies maybe some other sweets) are handed out
The adults get to drink some schnaps and donate some money to the group
Then as not every was always kind in the last year, the krampus are allowed to enter(this depends on the house owner, some just let one in others none and others all)
The krampus then torments the people inside
Involves rubbing your ears, pulling you of your seat, getting whipped and other things
Then they move on
Obviously they only visit you if you indicate that you would liked to be visited
Also on the street they can whipp you and get you
Now only men can be part of the group (except the angel)
So they say it's good luck for girls to get whipped
And if two groups meet, they "fight" each other (more of body checks against each other)
This all happens in good spirit
And people look forward to that time of the year, it's considered the 5th season of the year
Not so much an annual event per se, but also something with a kinda violent historical background
All federal states in Austria have their own hymn too of course, mostly singing about their natural beauty or landmarks
Tyrol's hymn has none of that and it's instead about a rebellious uprising during the Napoleonic Wars and the execution of its leader [Andreas Hofer]
(Additional fun fact, he was executed by a french firing squad and apparently as his last act made fun of them for missing their first shot
Probably the upcoming national holiday of Austria the 26th of October
It is a bit of an odd holiday as many Austrians get  the occasion wrong that is comemorated
Many believe it is the day the last allied troops left the country after WW2, reestablishing full independence
But in reality it is the date the Austrian parliament passed the neutrality law establishing Austria as a neutral country
Apart from many not knowing what is celebrated, the holiday itself has become more and more odd as time has gone on
Firstly Austria hardly acted neutral during the cold war, having strong if informal ties with the western powers (going as far as building its whole defensive plannimg on beeing rescued by NATO in case of a WW3), secondly since 1991 and the fall of the USSR Austrian neutrality has become irrelevant internationally, thirdly since we joined the EU, the mutual assistance clause of the EU supercedes the Austrian neutrality law
Yeah, the other half goes on other kinds of vacation
I live in southern Austria and used to work in tourism, everybody knew that August 15th was the buisiest day of the year
Because these kinds of things usually are based on some sort of human sacrifice
Well is a [RT interview] an official setting
idk if it counts as official but during one of the debates from the 2016 austrian presidental elections all candidates were asked to answer a question about some EU issue in english and [the rest is history]
She was our former PM and also former European deputee
But don’t worry, her native Romanian was as bad as her English
Her party ended up excluding her from any public positions in the end; I think it’s obvious why
(I’m sorry for the canned laughter, it’s the best version I could find):
From the party and period, she was the minister of labour in the former PM’s cabinet
Here she is addressing the UN:
"Ei vud laik tu wisch wuscha ä mevy kwistmäs"
Gott und Vaterland
We have a "wefachee problem"? News to me
Ah, Überbacher
I was thinking for quite a while but i couldt figure it out thanks
And if you ask me, that very much counts
I straight on died of laughter watching this
Thanks for sharing this gem of a video
They've certainly got an issue
[Like this
International event
You're right
Translation is incredibly widespread in the EU, so if you know you're horrible at English why not speak in your native language and have someone translate for you
Better than making a fool of yourself
Definitely gives off more vibes of the latter
Please help, what is he trying to say
I always thought I'm pretty good with deciphering accents, but this truly beats me :D
Which one of them
"Our movement"!!! Oh my god :D :D Thanks so much for sharing this gem
Antisemitism in general - I am not talking about the holocaust, the hostility against Jewish people didn't just come out of nowhere during the Nazi regime and in central Europe it unfortunately has a long history with constant persecutions and massacres
Even many Habsburgs were fervent antisemites, such as Maria Theresia
Also bad man with moustache
Well, for Austria it's probably the support for the nazi regime
Even though austria is regarded as the firs victim of nazi aggression, the majority of austria probably supported them and wanted the anschluss
Hey
The moustache guy, was actually
Never mind
No one outside of Austria is regarding us as the first victim
This myth was constructed by Exiles to get support for an independent Austria after the war ends
Sadly some people still believe this lie up to this day
Its really eary to read Austrian and German newspapers of the time cheering on these atrocities as "good christianfolk exterminating red rats"
>And for Germany the next most fucked up thing
You didn't say Austria, but I´ll guess you meant us as well
Well, the k.u.k did a lot of fcked up shit in the first world war
Burning down villages, executing thousands of civilians because they suspected them to be spying
They did this in occupied areas and in the homeland
WW 1 & WW2( Hitler was austrian)
besides that 30years war ( I know it was the holy roman empire at the time but Habsburgers were ruling
For Austria:
The first fucked up thing is the same as the Germans
the second fucked up thing for Austria was WW1
&#x200B;
The atrocities of the Austro-Hungarian army in Serbia seem to be almost entirely unknown nowadays
It lost like a quarter of it's population in WW1
Hitler didn't invent national socialism and race theory, and wasn't the only influential athor on those topics
*Something* awful along the same lines would have happened in 20th century Europe
>There's the old debate whether structures or individual figures are more influential in history
I think it needs an existing "structure" in order to allow individual figures to take over
IOW: Without wide spread pre-existing racism Hitler would have not happened
But: Without Hitler the consequences might have not been that terrible
&#x200B;
That's probably the most interesting alternative history timeline to me
What would have happened if Scheidemann doesn't proclaim the Weimarer Republik, and Liebknecht's Republic is the first one
How on earth is german of all languages the only one to not have created a word for this so far
Wait I heard Wochenendmelancholie too somewhere but I can‘t pinpoint where
Edit: All of my german friends did too
I think it‘s just an official unofficial word
This is a very local thing, but every year on the first day that the sun sets before all work is done/closingtime and artificial lights have to be turned on, the owner of the business will invite his workers out for food and drink
It's called "Liachtbratlmontag" meaning "light-roast-monday"
Today there is a fixed date its celebrated on, I think its September 29th
in austria we still have krampus, who was reinvented by the church but was a celtic tradition to scare away the bad ghosts
A happy Viennese
I cant ski
An Austrian or, even worse, a Tyrolian that isn't able to go skiing or snowboarding
Actually that is me and I feel like an alien
An Austrian who doesn‘t like skiing or hiking
Austrian here who can't ski and hates Sachertorte
An austrian who doesn't like schnitzel or drink beer
An Austrian who doesn't eat Schnitzel every day
An Austrian never complains, but I guess this applies to the whole balkans and east Central Europe
an austrian who doesn’t like skiing lmao i get  j u d g e d
A friend of mine (french) is allergic to wine and hates cheese
Does that count
Haha, you almost fooled me
An austrian that actually likes germans
An sober Austrian not complaining about anything
An Austrian that doesn't ski
An Austrian that likes neither skiing nor soccer
An Austrian that doesn't like Schnitzel
An Austrian that is not complaining
Also historically: Austrians that are not in some way antisemitic
Damn even our Jews hated on Eastern Jews
Wow
I'll tell you buddy if we ever meet in the morning I will very rudely refuse to wish you a good morning and not even acknowledge your existence
My granny is an Austrian tourist claiming the best pool spot at 6:30am
She always complains that she didn't get good spot because all of them are taken :D
A Greek who pays debts
I had to
Know plenty of those, especially since tickets have become so expensive
Nah, that's just me
That's me
I'm vegetarian
That would be my mom
(She is Hungarian but always complains about foreigner Jews in our district)
What gender do The Sun and The Moon have in your language/culture
I mean the Earth's Sun and Moon
In German it is "Die Sonne"(female,the sun) and "Der Mond"(male, the moon)
A quick wikipedia search later, I found out the Germanic Moon God was Máni (of course there are more/different ones too) and his sister Sól/Sunna gidess of the sun
So I think this has a big influence
I think in English one thinks of the moon as female and the sun as male, when personified
For me the greek/roman/hellenic(?) influence and their male sun gods and female moon godess always felt vaguely not right
Especially when learning latin and translating
Edit: if one of them is neutral, how is it depicted most commonly ?
Oh that's cool
Thanks
Oh that's fun
Oh thanks for looking into it
Seems like there was a lot of roman influence in addition to Germanic/Celtic
Oh okay
I think it also depends on the person, like don't you refer to it as Luna (poetic sense) and if English speaker make moon characters they are often female from my observations
Oh you are lucky that you never had an argument over the gender of Nutella
Oh that is interesting that the sun is neutral
Is the sun ever thought of as male or female ?
Oh that sounds like a plausible explanation
Yes,  that sounds right  I never new that the sun was neutral in many languages
Oh that is interesting
Are your dialects so different from the standard version that they ads a gendered prefix or suffix
That is an interesting point  especially about the man in the moon
Could that be that romans brought the female godess but celts had a male ? Anyway thanks for the idea
Oh okay
Es gibt so ein Meme/Witz das sich niemand einigen kann ob es das der die Nutella heißt. Manche sagen sogar  der Nutella
I think that too, but I have heard people say Dss Nutella so
Okay, thanks for the answer
Joghurt und Butter geht's sehr ähnlich
Das sind regionale Unterschiede
Oh hab der und das verwechselt
Ja, absolut
It is treason then
Das Joghurt, oder ? I just had do go trough all pronouns and all seems right

When we still had sea access :(
I often hear, other than the time Mozart and all the other important musicians lived around here, that during Austrio-Hungary and under Habsburg was the golden time of Austria
Along with the K&K monarchy
I partly agree with that, personally I think just politically now is kind of better than the rest of our history, because we‘re finally independent and neutral
But they didn't have defenestration back then, so something was definitely missing
Guess you're referring to the brown age
I feel like your golden age is right now, Germany is thriving, economically and politically one of the defining forces of the EU, under reasonable and stable leadership
What's not to like
Oh how i miss you Trieste *sobs*
Taking the submarines for a spin on the Danube is just not the same
Ngl these times were shit
I for myself truly love democracy

It rained the hole week (yeah could have expected that one)
We had a tourguid and i now think the island is made out of 70% churches, 29% ww2 bunker and 1% some flower thing, he gave us like 30 min for the flower thing cause the next buncker was so important even though it was the by far most intresting thing (and that comes from someone who doesn't care for flowers)
The food in the hotel was bad, like really bad
Yes england isn't known for good food but i was eating way better on the main island
The food in other places around the hotel wasn't much better
One example: The fish and chips shop some hundred meter away managed to make fish and chips that had more oil then fish, i literally could have made like 5 portions of fish and chips with the oil from my fish and chips
The area isn't anything special, the "capital" doesn't really look good and the rest of the island are just potatofields
Not even the cliffs that many say look beautiful look in any way intresting
I literally don't know why anyone would visit the island and the shitty hotel made it worse
Not exactly a horror story, but I was visiting a friend in Berlin and we planned all kinds of cool things and places to go, etc
etc
I took the train there, which was mostly fine, except that DB missed a connection, but I could take the next train without much problems
However, this was all taking place March 12th to 15th of this year
Flying back from Berlin was weird AF, because I was basically checking the news every few minutes if I were even allowed back into the country without being forced to go into quarantine or some shit
This measurement went into effect a few days later
Also, on the flight I was sitting next to some coughing old men first and luckily the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move up two rows to an empty row
Thank good, you kind Easyjet stewardess
It was still a nice trip overall, we spent some time day-drinking at the balcony, which was nice and all, but still, we had a lot more stuff planned that we didn't get to
I've been to Rome, Barcelona, Paris, London, NYC ... several times
I'm not a very careful person
The only places I've ever been mugged were Tokyo and Vienna, two of the so called safest cities on earth
It's weird
And this is why you don't send two rookies together on patrol, but pair each one up with an old established officer
> They got it back but I don’t know if they paid for it
They did
Instead of accepting the demands, they counter-offered to donate 52000 packages of cookies to different welfare facilities
The thieves accepted and the cookie was then found, tied to the horse statue in front of Leibniz University with a red bow
A few days later Leibniz made good on their promise and announced a lottery for the 52000 packages of cookies
Social service and welfare facilities could enter the lottery if they wanted cookies
The winner(s) were decided with a drawing
I don't know how many winners there were, or how many interested facilities in the first place though
This happened in Austria a month ago
A "similar" case
Ah the vagina train
Didn't some redditor who works at ÖBB post a photo from inside the cockpit
edit: [Found the post]
Not going to tell
Living in a highly touristy area, I'm 100% not going to tell the internet about the places and especially mountains that are not absolutely overrun
I haven‘t been to Salzburg often, but every time I was, which was about during tourist season, the city wasn‘t *that* overflown, which is a shame considering how beautiful the city is
The tourists are often only the house of Mozarts birth, but there‘s also the rest of the city which is soooo beautiful
I was in the Salzbergwerk Hallein and would go there any day if I had the chance
(Ofc not really something for people who dislike tiny spaces/rooms
Otherwise my favorite place for skiing is Bad Kleinkirchheim
It‘s so nice there and overall really great
I also really like places like Kufstein, Wörgl and many thermal baths in Styria
(Is Neusiedlersee underrated btw
Idk)
Anyway, I‘m not sure if any of those places are considered underrated if you consider that Austria doesn‘t have as many tourists as eg countries like France and Germany due to our country usually being quite unknown overall, excluding Vienna
That's the Austrian spirit
One hint for potential tourists: if you want a nice hike, make sure there's no cable car going up that mountain
Even then it can get crowded
Just look at Traunstein, Kleiner Sonnstein or Schoberstein
You're not guaranteed a quiet hike, that's for sure
Chances are higher, though
I know the mountains in lower Austria much better, and Rax & Schneeberg are for sure the most crowded ones
German and French in my opinion
With those languages you are ready for France, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland
Also many people in eastern Europe have German as their second language
Bonus: With those languages as basis it's also easier to learn Italian, Spanish, Dutch or Luxembourgian
Spanish, French, Russian, or a slavic language can be extremely useful, because, well, Spanish and French are two of the most spoken languages worldwide
And I think Russian is one of the languages of the UN
I just said maybe one slavic language because, unless you‘re in/from a slavic country, not that many people speak slavic languages, or at least that‘s what I think/notice
German, of course, is also a great choice if you‘re going to work in Europe, because it‘s still the most spoken first language in Europe, so I‘d definitely keep that up
> because of the size of the German economy
+ Austria
+ about half of Switzerland
Please don‘t be ashamed to speak a language
I guarantee you, almost all Germans know how much German sucks as a language and will understand that you may have problems learning it
But still, it‘s best to speak in the language you‘re trying to learn, because it‘s the best practice
As a Styrian I‘m also kind of surprised that nobody really spoke English where you went
Did you only speak to folks 35/40 and up
Because then yeah, it‘s quite rare to find anybody speak English in that age group, but below it‘s quite common
Also, I think it depends on what kind of Styrian you were encountered with and what region you went to (according to my german friends normal styrian is easier to understand than old-styrian or, god forbid, *stursteirisch* - which even many Styrians can‘t understand themselves :‘D)
But nevertheless, I hope you had a pleasant experience in both my country and my federal state, despite our (sometimes very) weird dialect
Yeah, on the countryside it might be that people have more of a problem with speaking English, but in cities or villages near cities it‘s very common to finde people below 30/35 or smth to be able to speak english very well (for one because of tourists but also because they‘re more likely to have a job in a big company that most likely requires some kind of basic english skills)
I've learnt that not all countries have personal identification cards which blows my mind
That's weird coming from an Austrian, since barely anybody has an  ID card here
You are cancer
I have one, since I did not own a drivers license for a long while and a passport is jusy too chunky to have with you every day :)
Woah I just checked on a map - I never realized Kazhakstan was that close to ukraine
Makes me want to go on a roadtrip
Fine, how about an austrian-led German state this time
You northerners had your chance, it's time for some real schnitzling
If you make a Wiener Schnitzel and then put sauce on it, it is no longer a Wiener Schnitzel
He had German citizenship by the 1930s. Surely you're not saying a foreign born individual can never be a true German
Adolf Hitler probably
Gavrillo Princip
If you take Hitler out of the game, there isn't really a historic person that comes to my mind
Modern day criminals like Fritzl or Priklopil are fare more present in peoples minds instead
Josef Fritzl probably
As sad as it is but thats not true
When I team up with Romanians in Counter Strike, I somehow always ask them what they think about Ceausecu, most ofnthe time they say that they like him and that he was a good one
Why is she so hated by Scotsmen
Everyone mocks him but i don't  think many people truly hate him
Björn Höcke must be hated by more peole than til schweiger is
Easy to hate him for a lot of things, but i liked him in "Knocking on heaven's door" (though that movie hugely benefitted from Jan Josef Liefers) and also "Der bewegte Mann".
I guess he's just a typecast and not really all that different in any of his movies
He killed Hitler, how can you be mad at him
You're right, how could I forget about the best General that the Empire had ever seen
But what did Franz II
do that makes him hated
Is it because he "ended" the HRR
I either talk to them about politics or if they have ever stuck their penis and testicles behind their thighs and pretended to have a vagina in front of the mirror
Ouch
Totally understand, didn't know that that fucked up neoliberalism hit Scotland so much harder than the rest of UK
Grammar is doable, but with lots and lots of hard work
Accent, I don't know
Usually, if you don't learn languages from a young age on, it's almost impossible to get it perfectly right
Even though you're really, really good, natives would probably still notice that you're no native yourself
But that's true for any language
Everything nightmare level
grammar and stuff like that is hard but doable
dialects otoh are impossible to learn
not even Germans can do it
some think they've mastered it, but they're not fooling anybody
there is always some giveaway and natives can spot dialects and place other Austrians in a certain region within a couple of words
I met some non natives who speak German fluently
Never met anyone without an accent though
Depends
We have a Dutch football trainer in Austria, Frenkie Schinkels, and he has quite the accent
Everybody loves him though, and his accents is very funny
[Here's an example of him speaking]
[Here's an example of him starting his musical career]
It should at least become a common option
Maybe not the standard yet, but an option
The company I work at switched from 40h/5 days to a 36h/4 day policy in March
Unfortunately this doesn't apply for me because it's not compatible with the contract I have at the moment, but holy am I looking forward to the change in a year's time
We're still kinda figuring out what schedules works best, but so far I'd consider it a positive change
Just a thought:
With things as they are you have to work 60+ hours
I bet your boss/management says they can't afford to hire someone so you don't have to work 60+ hours as it is
With increased demand however they'd have to hire someone
And suddenly you're not working 60+ hours a week but both of you work 40+ hours a week
Also obviously I don't know much about English law but 60+ hours a week sounds like something from the 19th century that can't be legal anymore today
Depends on the company
In my current company if you need something to be done, you better hope it's not Friday
The productivity on a Friday afternoon in many departments is inexistent
Also having worked 30h before I freely admit I am way more productive per hour back then
Jobs in a creative environment, like marketing agencies sometimes already pay full salary for 32h.
Of course that doesn't translate to every field
A factory owner needs to compensate by hiring more staff
A restaurant owner will need more staff
There's also jobs that aren't classic 9-5/5 days a week like farmers, nurses, etc
-- but those aren't really affected by the current system either
When Austria introduced the 40h week (from 48/45h before) salaries weren't reduced
So the total income stayed the same
It has worked in the 70s&80s. I do reckon some things changed since then but it's not like it hasn't be done before and was proven to work
And honestly I've worked for business owners who paid their workforce less than what an Uber driver makes, who claimed they can't fix broken office chairs because there's no money and then went on at the company Christmas party to throw around with money and brag about all the sports cars and real estate they bought recently
So my compassion for some of them is limited tbh
Thank you Germany, for always taking the blame for my country
Thank you Germany and France for getting over their old animosities and rivalries and finally teaming up
The French-German friendship is a factor the whole continent thrives on
Thanks Germany and Switzerland for having bigger and more qualitative media outlets that can do and do do investigative journalism about the jucier bits of the corrupt machine that is Austrian politics, whithout fear of financial losses or otherwise any retribution (keyword "Ibiza")
We would be truly in the dark without you
Thanks Italy, especially the towns along the old "Austrian Riviera" (Jesolo, Grado, Triest, Caorle, Lignano etc
) for putting up with our hordes of drunken tourists every year
Thanks (not the countries, but actually the people) to all those women (99% *are* women) from the east – especially Slovakia and Romania – who come here and take care of our old people, 24/7 for weeks en bloc, for shitty pay, under shitty (pseudo self-employed) conditions, with no labor organization backing them, in a strange country with a strange language and strange laws, far away from family and home, and enduring chicaneries of a xenophobic and neoliberal government
If any of you reading this are one of those women, or know one of those women, know, I am sorry
You people are seriously underpaid and mistreated, for work that is *absolutely* essential, and it's a shame how you're well-being is nothing but a playball to party politics
I'd like to thank the allied countries for kicking Nazi-Germany's ass
Thanks leader of germany in 1945 for killing hitler
> Also thanks Finland and Austria for maintaining their neutrality
This is more important to us than you think
Putin likes to make that pretty clear whenever he talks to Austrian media
Also thank you Sweden for harboring Kreisky, the best chancellor we ever had
Germans and Austrians understand each other for the most part
And then there's Vorarlberg
Interestingly for me it's somewhat easy to follow my Dutch friends talking, probably because I found out for myself that Austrian German and Dutch have some pretty close pronunciation patterns and similar words
E.g.: Dutch "niet" and Austrian "net" ("not" in English/ "nicht" in German)
Though my Dutch friends can follow standard German easier
I can understand dutch and swedish people a little bit
Not often, maybe once a month at most
If Trump does something big or something in relation with Germany, France or the EU then it‘s 100% talked about
Otherwise not really
Edit: On TV
On the newspaper in international it‘s almost daily
Austria here
We got you in our news almost daily and it's 90% about *The Donald*.
Well, right now your country is all over our news due your president claiming us to be of the Ewok race, but also with exploding trees
Trump just told everyone we have "forest cities" and "more explosive trees", so at the moment, a lot because we love to see our country mentioned, it's not a regular occurence outside of documentaries about the Nazis
But even without that happening, I'd say fairly frequently, if not every day then certainly every other day that US is on the front pages
It's always been like that and it's fine - your country's actions have the biggest impact on the world so naturally, the news outlets will focus on it
> Hopefully when Buren is president we will get less
[Martin van Buren] is making a political comeback
Color me surprised
It's really fuckin hard to avoid the shitshow of epic proportions that every US election is
Doesn't help at all that it goes on for like two years each time
Yeah, that's what it feels like
And even during our elections, I start to get exhausted by them by the end of it
Of course, I'm politically active, so there's quite a bit of running around and handing out flyers and what have you, but still
Two months is plenty
People don't forget who you are
So where's the big giveaway
;) #spoiltByYoutube
Looks like you spent a fortune with a professional design agency on it
Identity does not necessarily have anything to do with a common language and culture
An example: when the Austrian Empire collapsed, the country no longer had an identity
The economy was down and people had nothing left to be proud of
Many even wanted to join Germany
But after the Second World War, things changed radically
Today, Austria has a very strong identity
It came into being in the post-war period through many different things that have reunited us
An identity can emerge anew at any time
And as Switzerland proves, even different languages are no obstacle to a common identity
The EU can definitely go the way of Switzerland
And I think it will happen all by itself
Maybe not in 20 or 30 years
But possibly in 50 or 100
I think Europe is not a nation, but Europe is the idea that it is possible to live together in peace and in democracy and to leave behind the history of millenia of war that this continent endured for a prosperous future
Now that i am writing this i notice that this is kind of similar to the federation in star trek lol
i have to say yes, i believe in european identity as an austrian
austria had the lead of several countries from prussia to italy, from spain to romania when the hre still was a thing
as an austrian, i can connect several occasions from different countries all around europe into important historic moments for austria
even the fall of austria-hungary was a historic moment that took place in bosnia and herzegovina
we had an habsburg monarch as the leader of spain, the royals from gb, prussia, france and russia were related to austrias emporer
as an austrian, i always had the european identity in me, considering how important it was for austria through its whole history
also, i think we are at the verge to get one universal language, since we are all using the internet, where everybody can talk to everyone in english
and we see it with the younger generations, that english is becoming more and more use in the daily activities
it will start (or has started) simple with english words getting a meaning in german, which will get "eingedeutscht". since those words, which are obviously english, are now official german words, there will be more people who use other english words in a german sentence
its this weird english-german mixup language, that also exists in different other languages
we call it denglisch
it will be our launching pad for a universal, mostly english focused language
somewere else where you clearly saw this development, was when gb was leaving eu
we suddenly didnt have the english speaking country in eu, but france and germany (and several other countrys) agreed to use english as their universal language in parlament (instead of forcing everybody to now learn france or german)
those are little steps, but they are part of a clear path, to unite all of europe
We are all humans, I don't need anything else
All the other stuff is just man made bs
I think your "mixed salad" describes really well the motto of the EU:
"in varietate concordia" - united in diversity
Hallstatt in Austria
If you’ve seen that one photo everyone takes of it online, then congratulations you’ve already been there
It is small, super touristy, and there isn’t much to do or see there
There are a bunch of other smaller villages along lakes throughout that region that while touristy, don’t feel over run
I'd say Café Central and Café Sacher in Vienna
Seeing people queue up these (admittedly beautiful) cafés is funny to me
Hallstadt
But thats because no place, ever, is worth the hassle of working yourself through the sheer mass of tourists this place gets each and every day
And tbh, you kinda have to do it when you're a tourist
Hallstatt
It got to the point where the citiy had to limit the amount of busses allowed to enter the city
The Gardens around Blarney Castle are pretty nice thou
Do you mean to tell me that McDonald's in Ireland doesn't sell alcohol
I've been once
We took the last train home, because its really just a moneydump
As a Salzburgian, I gotta agree
But thats just one of the two cashcows
Mozart and Sound of Music
Endless amounts of money flowing in from these two tourist magnets
There is a lot more stuff to do in Salzburg that are way better experiences
And can you imagine how surreal it is for us now
No tourists
In summer
Just the oddest sort of calm and relaxing
If you're interested in classic musicians, I can really recommend the Esterhazy castle in Eisenstadt, in Burgenland (east)
It's where Haydn worked, and his birth house is very close as well :) My mom works there, so I've pretty much grown up there
It's really lovely
Honestly I loved Paris, but that's probably because I had no expectations
Me and my mother just split up from the guide and discovered the city on our own (we both speak French well enough to get along)
As every big city it has its shady places, but the adventure was what did it for me
We try to go every year to see what changes since our last visit
Its nice for like
one night
Check off all the sights worth seeing and then go elsewhere in France (or Europe, whatever)
At those prices, that must've been one hell of a joke
They get 1 million visitors a year, which means around 2700 visitors a day
Germany, of course
But not the other way round
Some people here really hate Germans
I don't even know why
In my experience, the Germans like us a lot
I would say Germany
They're kinda Austria's big brother, so there's always this rivalry
For example, when the german football team (Who usually plays very good) lost against Austria's team (Which doesn't play good at all, to say it nicely) everyone made fun of the Germans
It's probably also because we are culturally very similar, however almost no austrians identify themselves as german, so we have this kind of rivalry to be "seperate" from germany
It's kind of a love-hate-relationship
Balkan love triangle (it's complicated)
fuck that overweight guy in the north, we're the true rivals
Switzerland is basically just Salzburg with a better tax haven
I think all of the german-speaking countries (Austria, Germany, Switzerland) have some sort of rivalry with each other, because we are ethnically pretty similar, but all of us want to be seperate from another
Kinda strange love-hate-relationship
Is that one of those one-sided rivalries
Maybe we austrians are just too focused on the rivalry with germany
Am I not understanding the balkans right or is it really more of a polygon
I mean the Balkans seriously seem like a free for all
Well, there is much arguing, but most austrian people accept that south tyrole is italian
But of course there are the obligatory monarchist who think austria should get it back and we should be a monarchy again etc
, but those area minority, a loud one though
[nah]
I don't really think so
Ok, AH prevented the region from getting unified under local rule, but other than that, they weren't much worse than any other cultural supremacists in europe
probably because they couldn't.
even so, I am not AH
>This isn't a comparative issue, btw
It's just Austrian history leading to WWI
What do you mean by that
No, they usually pass out while having a cig and set their room on fire
But the two drains are standard here
Goddamit, Finland at it again
Haven't seen it in a shower I think
Also never heard of someone passing out while showering
I've never heard of something like this
In the shower
Bathtub yes, but never seen two drains in a shower
Wow that's dark
usually it's hidden behind the knob for closing the drain
According to r/Austria, even people in Vienna felt it
Southern Austria, I felt it lying in bed
All the best to you guys in HR, stay strong
Apparently my roommate felt it here in Graz, Austria
He thought he dreamt it when he woke up until
he saw the news
I have a ridiculously deep sleep, so didn't wake up
hmmmm
fuck
Mallorca away from any “Ballermann”Locations is actually stunningly beautiful
The City of Palma, Soller, Matala, St
Elm, Andratx, the Tramuntana mountains
you really miss out if you have been to Mallorca and not seen these
Same with locations like Ibiza and Bali, that are whole islands
also, Dude
Lloret de Mar is a city, Thailand is a country
Perspectives
Agree, Dubai was a terrible visit
Boring, everything artificial and you felt caged
Never again
I think Barcelona is an excellent location, unfortunately way to many people share that opinion
For just beach and sun there are really better places but the history and culture is really nice
I also loved those annoying sounding parrots that are all over the place
It seems to be quite the location if you are looking to purchase cocaine
Locals as in not the staff at the hotels, they're often paid to recommend certain restaurants
It is brutal, but don’t worry, the air conditioning is cracked to Eskimo literally everywhere so you for sure get sick when you come home
Depends on the people I'd say;) A lot of people go to Thailand for the monuments, the general culture and the beautiful nature’s scenery
I know a bunch who went there solely for bike trips, something which I consider strongly myself once this Covid mess is over .
China and Japan are great
Honestly I also would love to visit North Korea
There is a trip where you start in Vienna, Austria and go to NK through Russia and China
all by train, including the famous Transsibirian
- that’s on my to-do-list for quite a time now:)
Shouldn't trust, it's better to ask locals outside the hotel
It was really terrible for circulation
The interesting story would probably be pushed quite down on my reasons list, it’s actually the unique time-capsule state the whole country is kept in plus I am a huge fan of certain 20th century aesthetics, that are met in a country like NK
Also in Mongolia
Ulaanbataar's Stalinist Brutalism architecture is famous
You don’t go to the beach or the pool per taxi, you walk around outside in the city at places/a park/a trip/whatever at some point or you are on a terrace
if you aren’t belonging to the race of Mole People you sure want to see the sunlight at some point and not solely be confined to the hotel-mall-restaurant circle
German: Stuhl - chair
Austrian German: Stuhl - human shit
German Stuhl is a chair, Russian стул is a table
Even worse that a chair is стол, it always makes me think for a second
Ambulance (correct translation: Rettungswagen)
Ambulanz (ER)
Labor (correct translation: Arbeit)
Labor (Laboratory)
Gift (correct translation: Geschenk)
Gift (poison)
Also (correct translation: auch)
Also (so, as in "so, what now
Probe (correct translation: untersuchen)
Probe (correct translation: rehearsal or sample)
See in German means both Sea and Lake
Arm in German means both Arm and poor (adj)
Typical case of a word with the same root, but semantically it developed differently in both languages
It comes from geben/give
A gift, as well as poison is something you *give* someone
In German this old meaning is still preserved in the word *Mitgift* (dowry, literally "with-gift")
> "Dick" in German would be "thick" in English, whereas "fett" in German would be "fat" in English
Those are the cognates, yes
Semantically those words are still not the same
"Fett" has a much more negative connotation than "fat".
Ahahaha, let's just say it was a typo
No no it's not a false cognate
English gift and German Gift *are* cognates
They used to mean the same thing, 1000 years ago (or whenever, idk exactly)
However after that the meaning has taken a different path in German (towards poison), while it has stayed close to its original meaning in English
This is for me the biggest giveaway to sneakily differentiate between Austrians and (Northern) Germans when they are speaking English, or even a very very neutral standard German
Because Austrians as a rule don't have a voiced s, and it's pretty hard to learn it and consistently and correctly use it
You can unlearn other "Austriazisms" when speaking standard German or another language, but the voiced s is always one of the last things that to keep
Oh I misunderstood then, sorry
I love living in Austria
We do have problem of conservative mindsets and corruption, but the positive things are more dominant
We have beautiful nature, mountains and lakes, decent cities and overall good healthcare and education
I work in a foreign country with a lot of different foreigners and when we talk about our homes I'm glad that I live in Austria
Well, I made the conscious decision to move here so yes, I like living in Austria
Yes, I really like it and I wouldn't want to live in another country for the rest of my life
It's save, we have a good health care system and free but at the same time good education
We have beautiful lakes and mountains and lots of interesting history and culture
There are quite a lot of conservative people here, especially on the countryside, but in general we are becoming more and more open minded
Austria isn't perfect but I do think it's one of the nicest countries to live in
I am from Spain and I have lived in Germany: in Saarland and Hamburg, whereas I literally hated Saarland, I fell in love with Hamburg
Germany is a pretty nice place to live if you don't mind the weather and people being super scheduled and mostly refusing to be your friends unless you can speak German (again, this is my experience)
Weather sucks for the most part
Cities are super clean and supermarkets are open quite long
For the past seven years I have been living in Austria and man, I have super mixed feelings about this country
I have been wanting to leave eversince I arrived and here I am  there are plenty of jobs here, payments are pretty decent and also social plans such as maternity and sick leaves and all those things are very well managed and as an employee you have many many rights
They are also very well organised but not as tight as Germans I would say
However, they are super proud of being Austrians and of their food and nature and traditions, which for me as a Spaniard is a bit confusing because I am not used to that sense of belonging
And if you don't like outdoor sports you are most likely to be the background friend because everybody does outdoor sports here
People are really nice and warm and social
I have never felt lonely whatsoever
Opening times of supermarkets and stuff are too tight and chances  if you work longer than 6pm and are stuck in traffic you won't make it to the supermarket
And the weather sucks
Bro I would love to go back to Spain or Portugal or some warmer country
Would you rather live in your own country or somewhere else and if yes, how many
In general i like it pretty much, except for the climate
I think would really be a little bit warmer, especially in the winter
I wouldnt mind moving to southern italy or so because i really love the culture and the weather there
(or i just wait for climate change to happen, then i might also like the temperature here)
Summer
In Iceland
*presses X to doubt*
>I love living in Austria
We do have problem of conservative mindsets and corruption,
Although Austria was always somehow split regarding conservatism
We are quite conservative with technology on the one hand but relatively liberal regarding sexuality
Prostitution is legal, we have a rather low age of consent and practices like BDSM are not forbidden (actually we don't have a current legal status because there are nearly no cases which were judged) which is for example forbidden in Switzerland
Also we have a green president
Edit: I agree on the corruption problem though
If you need to save money to move, just 50 pounds a month can help you cover the costs in a few years
No need to stay desperate, you can do it if you put your mind to it
If you find a job abroad they might be able to help you move too
Yeah you are right, I think it's the pornographic depiction of it or something alike, or a certain degree of violence which is allowed in Austria but not ion Switzerland
Austrian here
As another Austrian stated: We miss the sea or direct access to it
So, dear Triest, wanna come back home to good old Austria
;-) We  could give our relationship a new try
We promise to be nice this time and we won´t cheat on you with that Germans again
I have never heard of any single person who would have travelled from Vienna to Lake constance to go on swimming vacations there
A tiny itty bit of access
And don't get me wrong, Lake Constance is nice and all, but an ocean it ain't.
I mean historically you and the Swedes fought a lot but after losing Skane you became irrelevant
Just imagine being in a coastal town and all the people are Austrian
feels kinda weird in my head
Don't say that
If Boris reads this, he'll want to tow Britian westwards
thanks, i hate it
Don't ever go to Lignano
It *is* fucking weird, and embarassing
No offence, but Denmark still lost consistently for over 500 years since the Kalmar Union was dissolved in 1523 (guess in 3 years you can celebrate the fifth centenary beginning of the downfall)
And I am gonna make a case for it, right here, right now
First up, your "possessions" Greenland and Iceland weren't worth much, were they
Both islands had small populations, whose only worthwhile export was fish and whaling
For Norway it was similar, the only real revenue came from ore mines in the mountains
Schleswig-Holstein was a decent province if you actually had full control over it, but it was largely ruled by nobility and the king had limited influence until he was able to secure leadership after several bloody internal wars
After the loss of Skane every external war Denmark participated was a loss or a costly stalemate, which is all the worse because Denmark often was the attacker in these situations
1658 Skane was conquered, in 1814 Norway was lost, Schleswig in 1867 completely
During the era inbetween losing Skane and losing Norway Denmark waged so many wars that failed that the state was on the constant verge of bankruptcy
Not to forget Denmark sold its only Caribbean possessions in 1917
The only "win" I can see is that Denmark reunited with (the worst) parts of (Northern) Schleswig in 1920 after a war they didn't fight in
In 1940 Denmark was occupied by Germany and Iceland was occupied by the British
1944 the latter's independence was declared
After WW2 Denmark had two remaining oversees possessions, Greenland and Faroe Islands
Both are nowadays largely politically autonomous (I wasn't able to find any data on taxes and subsidies to the territories so I am just gonna assume that most taxes are retained locally and Denmark subsidises the territories)
The Faroe Islands have so much autonomy in fact that they are an equal member of the Nordic Council and operate representatives in both the UK and Iceland
With Iceland they have a united economic zone
They are so autonomous the assembly could declare independence tomorrow and largely nothing would change for the island
Similarly situated, Greenland is completely internally autonomous and can also boast an equal membership within the Nordic Council
All the resources are property of Greenland itself and not Denmark, while Denmark is stuck with meeting defence requirements
Donald "the Orange" Trump would call it a bad deal and it is one as Denmark has withered to the smallest size its ever been since its inception
You might counter that with the EU Denmark has achieve unmatched prosperity, however I state that this is the case for both large and small countries and has nothing to do with the miniscule size of Denmark today
Don't take my comment too seriously, Austria also lost all its power, but it was a stab instead of a wasting away
>You're pretty much right about everything the only thing i will add is that we did actually win the war against Sweden to get Skåne back in the 1670s. We had it, but then Sweden got their ally France involved who told us to give it all back again
Must sting when your only ally falls you in the back and makes a separate peace with France
>And of course we technically won the great Northern war but I agree that we were pretty clearly carried by Russia
We barely did anything and for that reason we only got Slesvig-Holsten back
Skåne stayed Swedish
I just read how Sweden knocked Denmark-Norway out within a year and only through the bloodthirst and hubris of Karl XII's defeat at Poltawa was Denmark brave enough to reenter the war
Also the "win" of Holstein can barely be described as such as the land only became independent as rebellious dukes switched to Sweden in the first place
I have only lived in Austria for three years but I don't plan on moving back to Germany anytime soon
I love Vienna, it's the world's most livable city
Why would I leave
Well my friends get a little amused when I say things that only exist in Standard German
Then I remind them that we invented the language they are bastardising
And of course I laugh when they say weird things
It's all in good fun
Not my country but Medieval Iceland had "to drive the Elves away" as a funny way to say that
>Don’t ever use that in an actual conversation though, lol
you ain't the boss of me
For some reason, a lot of German cities have really funny names
next to Essen and Darmstadt, off the top of my head I can think of:
Gelsenkirchen - mosquito church
Pforzheim - fart home
Düsseldorf - retard village (kinda)
hey you can't quote the whole thing in one comment, depriving people of building it up in a comment tree
that's against the *rules
* (great song tho)
sometimes also "funny because racist". never heard of the concept of an inappropriate joke
I got another one for you:
What's the difference between a truckload of bowling balls and a truckload of babies
The truckload of babies is easier to unload with pitchforks
The Niva, called Taiga here, is popular with hunters
Other than that, not really
Not exactly but they were well respected for being rugged and easy to fix
Moskvitch on the other hand are still joked about for being small
I am a hunter and this is new to me
It‘s Suzuki Jimny all the way
I think the Urban was an attempt to "SUVifye" it, it had more "stylish" exterior like different bumbers
But yeah, they change the name every other year, I think nowadays its called Bronto, but in Austria funnily it's called Taiga since ages
Well it's used in light woodlands here mostly
I'm seeing it very often here in Styria and in Burgenland
Also never seen a Jimny, mostly the older Samurai
Here in Upper Austria a lot of hunters drive around in Ladas
AFAIK even some employee of Bundesforste has one with ÖBF Logo on the side
It's mostly just "Lada", since it's AFAIK the only model sold - or at the least the only one that's somewhat present
Yeah, people call it just Lada, because the other doesn't sell well
But I've meant the official Name given by lada is 4x4 Taiga, were in other countries it's called just 4x4 or Bronto
My first boyfriend was french and he didn’t take his shoes off in the house when he came over to have dinner with my family, and then proceeded to talk about how great french wine is and that wine from Vienna has a weird taste that he doesn’t like, etc
And then he proceeded to tell my mother that her food was too heavy, and asked me why I was not fat at the end of dinner
My mother forbid me from seeing him again, and then decided to set me up with a guy from Russia two weeks later despite the fact that I was still in a relationship with him
Complete disaster
An englishmen asked me what my favourite light-beer is
I don't even know where i could buy such an insult of a beer in austria
Once a group of Brazilians came to Austria for a joint project with the automotive company I was working
They stayed a couple of weeks and were really friendly and outgoing guys
They decided to go out one day in the city and asked about shady placed to avoid at night, so they dont get into trouble or robbed
I couldnt think of one dangerous place
Disclaimer: i live in a 300k town where the worst you can get into is a nice offer for some narcotics
Who would do that
In Austria, they usually stop for pedestrians to cross
Not everybody, of course
But it's not like in Istanbul, where I even had green light and still couldn't cross safely
Obviously I had the reverse experience when going to places that don't put pedestrians as much on a pedestal as it is being done in Vienna
cause quite a few angry people honking at us because we just started walking
Of course we felt sorry and were aware we had to adapt , but at the same time I couldn't help but think, Yeah tough luck, if there's people on the road, you get to wait
I think I like how Vienna does it
!!! Thank you, it is absolutely repulsive and I find myself completely disgusted with this as an adult now
And my mother, to her credit did not have an aneurysm with he walked on her carpet with them on
You can say that, but he basically insulted her country, her mother and her home
I am unsure if he could have done more to anger the parents
I have an eastern background but I have since learned that westerners do this
Still, it shocks me when I see it and I am unable to understand why people do such things
That is really, really funny
I feel deeply sorry for him as it sounds like he had a similarly painful experience, haha
Some Restaurants had at 6:30pm "early bird" menues when I was visiting, used that much
My condolences
should've just told him to go back to the entrance and take his shoes off
that's what I would do, honestly, don't care if you're the president, if you enter the house, take off your shoes dammit
He also said that Austrian cake is 'dry' and 'bland'.  I am just glad my mother didn't chase him out of our house with a knife
interestingly, over here that's a distinctly working class thing
Holy shit, that's unreal
I hope your "womanly instincts" have matured since then because that guy seems to be the antithesis of a good son in law
My father would kick someone so impolite out if my sister ever brought them home and he tolerated a lot of shit from her boyfriends
Adding to that: maybe it was also a misunderstanding about what "meeting your roommates" entails
There's a huge difference between "we'll get together in the evening and maybe have a beer and talk a bit", and "we all took some time and assembled everybody to hand you your keys and have you sign the subrental contract".
I'm totally with you on this one
Over here, eating dinner before 18:00 is only done if you're in a hospital or below 5 years old
How do people not get hungry afterwards
Yes, I metaphorically kicked him in the face and I have not/will not ever date someone from France again
No, he was quite charming but I later learned that he had another girlfriend still in Paris so it was not meant to be
Lessons learned
Why would you want a snack in the before the main meal of the day
Ruins appetite for dinner and shifts dinner on a time way to late to properly digest to sleep well
Don't have to go far to get a different experience honestly; even here (which I would argue is a place that in general is quite "smiliar culturally" to yours up North) things work differently
If I had to explain it, I'd say that being a bit late can feel like the more *dignified* thing to do
It really depends on context though, and there's of course situations where you better make fucking sure you're on time (best example: appointment for a job interview)
But in a more intimate setting among friends, it can come across as stiff or tactless to be totally on time, sharp
Maybe because you didn't anticipate your host's needs for some extra preparation time, or because you don't show willingness to discern between a friendly and a professional setting, basically saying you feel with your friends like you'd feel at a job interview
Same for leaving – I can't tell you how often I had to fight the impulse to feel offended when I stayed in Japan, and people honestly started packing up and leaving at the indicated time
Back at home, that's when things start to get comfy and interesting, and leaving then (exception: if you have some other important appointment, of course) is a bit like saying you don't really want to be friends, because you'd rather go home than "change your plans for us" (which were no real plans to begin with, because everybody already *expects* to stay longer than planned anyway)
In summary: It has of course nothing to do with different levels in politeness, and everything with adhering to what's *expected* that people would do; and it shows that *what* is expected of them, can differ greatly between cultures, and can be hard to know if you didn't grow up there
Sorry wasn't meant in a derogatory way at all, I just noticed the difference between the place I'm from on the countryside (paying whole rounds is a kind of one-upping one another among younger males there), and how it's never done among a student crowd in the city
Figured it's because a) they don't have enough money and b) use other things than money for dick-waving contests, like telling you about all the places they've been to
Yeah, it's just different concepts of what's allowed, and how people are expected to behave (see my [comment] above)
No difference in respect or politeness levels, just different things that are perceived as polite or respectful
agreed
It's fine, I was a stupid teenager and it happens
I wish it was more common to openly state your intentions when you are on a date/getting to know someone, because I think this would solve many, many problems people have today
And thank you
Do you mean 6 o clock at "afternoon"? I'd call that evening
Anyways, if also people in Italy are hungry by that time, why put a bandaid on instead of go to the root of the problem = have dinner
Haha right; don't wanna be a *pesado* after all
[Hatschi Bratschis Luftballon]  (Hatschi Bratschis air balloon)
It's a very famous book for children in Austria
It's about the young boy Fritz who gets kidnapped by the Turkish wizzard Hatschi Bratschi who steals children with his hot air balloon
Spoiler:
Hatschi Bratschi falls out of the balloon and into a well while trying to abduct more kids
Fritz is alone in the balloon now and gets attacked by a witch which in the end burns to death and gets eaten by ravens
Fritz flies over the alps, first to Italy, then to an island where the people eat humans (which are portrayed by stereotypical black people) and then to Turkey to rescue all the already kidnapped children
The end
Edit: since the 1960s it has been criticised for being racist and parts of the book have been changed
For example the cannibals are now normal monkeys who just attack the balloon
I loved the story with the thumbsucker
The tailor with his huge scissors is drawn so dynamically and swift
Always when I her the word "flink" I imagine that tailor
The anti racism story in there is also great
"Well, you kids always made fun about the moor
I dye your skin with ink, now you are even darker as him, that serves you right"
The Little mermaid is also pretty dark in original variant
Spoilers: She didn't get the prince and the only way not to turn into sea phoam is to kill him which her sisters urges her to do
She couldn't but instead of dying she turned into s wind ghost/silph as "reward"
I also remember that mermaids shouldn't have souls and the only way to get one is by being loved by a human
Ah yes, good old Grimm's tales
Disney tends to leave out all the good parts
Also, TIL the Czech names of Hänsel und Gretel
You should read up on the real story of Rapunzel
It has has pretty fucked up parts:
Rapunzel is named Rapunzel because her mom had some serious pregnancy hunger flashes and wanted some rampion salad (Rapunzel)
Her husband got it for her – from a witches garden
In exchange he has to promise the child to the witch (I mean, of course)
The witch puts Rapunzel into the tower, because she is such a beautiful child
The prince then comes and "visits" **the twelve-year old girl Rapunzel** in her tower (climbing up by her hair), after he had heard her sing
It is the very first time in her life that Rapunzel sees a man
He continues to "visit" her, and brings her pieces of cloth every time, so she can make a ladder and get down herself
But when the stepmother-witch gets wind of that, she cuts off Rapunzels hair and banished her to some wasteland
When the prince comes the next time the witch lets down Rapunzel's hair, and the prince climbs the tower, and is frightened
The witch tells him that the girl is not here anymore, so in his grief he jumps off the tower, and falls into a bunch of thorny bushes
**The thorns cut his eyes out, and he is henceforth blind**. He somehow roams through the world for years, blind, and full of sorrow
Until he hears a beautiful voice one day
It's Rapunzel **and her twins**, which apparently she got in the meantime (remember those "visits"?)
They reunite, she cries, her tears drop on his eyes and he can see again
I always thought on a dark clothed man, like the typical thief/burglar
Is she invited in the original story
I remember her having to wander the earth doing good deeds to finally go to heaven
Also the author was a devout Lutheran, so the story was more deeply Christian in general and less „Catholic“, whatever that means
I even know that ballad, it was interpreted to a pretty popular song by the German "medieval rock" band In Extremo (and also is featured in the first Gothic game)
Ah yes, I remember that one
Root of many spooky and dark stuff is the 30 years war which wracked havoc on the land and caused hunger and desperation
Or an would just stand on the sidelines until everyone is  beaten by putin and then pull out a glock and shoot him
What was a misunderstanding that only happened because someone grew up in a drasticly different nation
I talked to a dutchman who lives in austria for years so he knows the region
During the conversation he ask me which village i am from and i said the name
He reacted with: the one over there 10 min away from (other village) up that one mountain
Me: yes that village is nearby but there is no mountain near us
It took us 5 min to figur out that our definition of a mountain are drasticly different
What are your similar stories
@allDutchPeople
I'm really generous when calling that 700m "mountain" a hill
I used to work as a server at events, anything from weddings, business events, expos, anything really
Usually for the evenings we would have a selection of one red wine and one ehite wine
Now working these jobs in Germany, what we served was mostly German wines, often produced in our own county (Baden-Württemberg), but sometimes from neighboring counties (i.e. Pfalz) or somewhere else in Germany
However if I got asked whether the wine was local, my answer would very much vary depending on who asked
For an American, anything pretty much produced in Germany I'd call local
For a German however, especially if they are from this area, I'd distinguish whether it was made in our direct vicinity (around 50km radius), our county or further away
But then again, we had different stuff at every event and I was never allowed to taste beforehand, so if anybody had any questions I'd usually make up some bullshit (for those who obviously had no clue and wanted to show off in front of their peers) or sent my manager to talk to them (for those who obviously knew a lot more about wine than I did)
It's the somewhat literal translation of German "würzig" ("spice" = "Gewürz"), that's why many German natives confuse the meaning
Ask them if they like it "scharf".
It's weird how different words for tastes can be
There is no good German word for "savoury", for example
You should probably call your jalapeño-infused food "sharp", to not cause any misunderstanding :D
I'm probably more stupid than you, I don't even know what hurling is
In the city: if it's less than 20 minutes by public transport away, or you can walk there, it's close
Outside the city: Anything with less than one to two hours driving necessary is close, anything above that is far
Honestly, the lack of a commonly used word like "forenoon" is one of the things I struggle with most in English
Morning just feels too early, like something between 6 an 9 am maybe
After that, and up until noon, it's Vormittag dammit
Not quite
It's similar (and used as such sometimes), but it's not the same
There are lots of savoury things around that are not very herzhaft
Pikant
Not really
Take Rindsuppe: it's definitely savoury, but you wouldn't call it *pikant*.
Deftig
Would green salad be *deftig* to you
No, but also not savoury
I give up :)
Plain grean salad with vinaigrette *is* savoury
And yeah, there isn't any good German word for "not sweet". Take that, people who say German has a word for everything ;)
tbh pikant is used in *exactly* that way, with the meaning of "opposite of sweet".
I was born and raised in a small village in South Tyrol, a formerly Austrian region in northern Italy
While I did feel at home, I always felt a bit different
My dad's Austrian, so my surname was atypical for the region; in primary school heritage was really emphasized, everyone knew their family back to their great-grandparents or further back and had at least 1 cousin attending the same school
Meanwhile, I had no idea about most of my more distant relatives and many of the closer ones lived many kms away
(Though in hindsight I'm glad I dodged the incest bullet :D )
Also, regional patriotism that has its roots in the napoleonic wars was pushed, especially by older teachers
Never understood that either
Their narrow-mindedness and focus on their roots may have helped to keep their cultural identity alive after becoming part of Italy, but they've long been granted wide-reaching autonomy rights, so it really feels outdated and out of place by now
I live in Austria now and feel much more at home here
Yes
My valley is extremely rural and traditional
I’m currently studying in the next big city and it’s astonishing how much more open minded people are here
Many people in my valley think it’s the most beautiful place in the world, and yes, it is beautiful but most of the people who say that have never even left Austria
Depends
Austria has a real bad reputation of being Xenophobic, which I‘m 100% not
But with the younger generation this seems to slowly fade-away, so it might just be that
Along with the anti-LGBT stuff (two of our three biggest political parties are against LGBT-marriage (I think it only has been made legal recently, like 2018
)) and, well, I‘m in the LGBTQ+ community
However this also seems to fade because we have pride parades in every federal state, I think, and the younger generation seems to barely care about wether you‘re LGBT or not
I wouldn‘t mind living in Switzerland tho
I kinda love Switzerland
Germany I wouldn‘t like living in so much but wouldn‘t mind either
Edit: I do however love that Austria has such a wide range of nature along with history to it and I absolutely love our culture, festivals, traditional clothing etc etc
I wouldn‘t move to another country just from my free will
May I ask what the social norm on Greece is
Like, religious, traditional and conservative or is there more to it
Do you speak another dialect or do you speak standard German
Can you maybe relate to Thüringen, Sachsen, Hessen, Baden Württemberg more or not at all to German culture
The thing in South Tyrol is, you can also get good italian food
That's one thing they do really well
Oh okay
From what I know German federal states are all pretty different, especially Bavaria because even Austrians often think it‘s more Austrian than German (mindset, tradition clothing, dialect, etc etc), so I thought maybe you could identify with other states
I still hope you‘ll be very happy with where you are and who your are tho
No problem, you deserve it <33
We have the highest Alcohol consumption in the world, its weird if you don't drink
What I've noticed is that the more reserved a country generally is, the more ballistic people go when drunk
Stray dogs
I remember when I was a kid, I had to know the dog-free areas of my city to get around and not get bitten
Now there are hardly any around
Unless you are walking in a remote area (like old railway tracks, disused factories) you won’t encounter any
Honorary mention: old Dacia cars
Sounds similar like the cigarettes here
As an 8yr old my mom used to send me to get cigarettes and there never was an issue, they always sold them to me
When I started smoking at 13 I never had problems buying cigarettes
Today there's huge, huge fines on selling cigarettes to minors
You don't have free public toilets in the UK
No skin on the fish is a great loss, my condolenses
Mebel is super similar to German Möbel, some dialects would pronounce it like that
I think it‘s better to have the fines than get cigarettes easily tbh
I‘d rather have a hassle buying cigarettes for my dad when the cashiers know my dad is (almost) behind me than knowing I, as a minor, can get cigarettes easily
I'm happy with 'love', but a waitress recently called me "my love" and that was a bit startling
That was in Sheffield, and she was fairly young
free public toilets are disappearing here too
Oh certainly
It was incredibly stupid to start smoking so early and easy accessibility helped with that
These fines should have existed much earlier
Sadly, investing in public toilets in France is not something I expect beyond perhaps more optimised (i.e. discrete) pissoirs
The only ones I've ever seen are from our local cult of crazy, founded by American "missionaries". Sadly, my parents were members and I had to grow up with that shit
It's all stuff like "Have you accepted Jesus in your life
" and "Prayer works".
We had one prominent billboard on our german border which said "Grüss Göttin" which translates to Greet Goddess, which is a comon greeting form in german but with God instead of Goddess normally
Other than that I don't think I've ever seen one
Religion is a very private thing
The Catholic Church has done PR campaigns in the past, but that was nothing like the stuff you described
More like "Hey look at us, we're not all old farts or rapists
Here's some slightly younger and vital people smiling
Please continue to pay our membership fees
And organisations that are somehow related to churches, e.g. charities like the Catholic Caritas, the Protestant Diakonie, the Catholic Dreikönigsaktion (little kids dressing up as the Three Wise Men, going from house to house around January 6th, singing carols, and collecting millions of euros in donations for projects in the third world), an others also have PR
But that Evangelical shit is a very fringe thing, and they are very quiet
There's a big banner saying "Jesus loves you
" or something like this on one of the churches, but other than that: no
Our law makers also don't start their session with a prayer
Never seen one
Most billboards I see are about food (aka like 95%)
Never seen huge things like that
&#x200B;
What is somewhat common is a newspaper-sized thing near a church door (on the wall or some sign post etc
), where the have information like the time for mass and confessions, plus some picture with sentence like "Never forget, with his infinite love and compassion, he died for us all" or "Giving to people in need will yield the largest return"
There is a famous one in Vienna
Near the area that was formerly used by many street hookers there was one stating "There is one that loves you, Jesus Christ". on a church wall
It has become a bit redundant when the city forced the women to relocate to other areas
Not only do they want your money, it's also a pretty easy way of making people do whatever you want them to do
Wait, not everyone gets their own personal Jesus
Someone to hear their prayers, someone who cares
Idk if it counts but Standard German
Like, we technically don‘t speak Standard German, we only speak in Dialects and Austrian-German
Other than that: Dutch
It‘s quite easy to read, probably because it‘s so similar to German
Still couldn‘t ever speak it or translate word by word
Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are also understandable to some extend
Like, I can guess many words because they‘re so similar to German
(eg
Huskat or Kat/Katt/Katt - cat/Katze) And if I see a sentence with the translation next to it I can easily guess wich word is supposed to be which
(eg [norwegian] God dag (?) - Guten Tag)
I can perfectly understand written German from Germany, even though they use some funny words now and then
But the farther north you go the more unintelligible it gets
As an Austrian I'm able to read Dutch, although its hard sometimes
German
No one speaks it here, but we easily understand it when reading (just kidding)
Dutch and Luxembourgian would be two of them
Just asking: How well do you understand polish
I have a polish friend and I understand some polish too due to my mother being polish and if he or I speak polish my Hungarian friend sometimes understands a word or two
I think they do - at least Austrians have very much a clue when reading dutch and every German in here says dutch
But I think we can’t understand it as good as the Swiss people
I'm slovak and that's exactly how polish sounds to me
like a toddler making up his own words :D
>Kazakh actor
Sacha Baron Cohen is a Brit
I'm slovak and i don't understand shit in polish :D I'm fluent in Czech thought but that's probably because we were still a single country when i was a kid and we didn't really have any slovak tv channels for some time, only Czech
i wonder how is it with kids nowadays if they understand Czech since our countries are a bit distant now
also i have some experience from recent years when i tried to speak slovak to Czechs and they looked at me like I'm speaking klingon :D so i rather speak Czech when in Czechia
the culture of 'sudern' (=complaining about everything)
Daytime drinking, and events that dress up as cultural or national holidays or festivals so everyone is fine to daytime drink
Festzelte, Kirtage, Food Festivals, Music festivals, Christmas markets etc, etc, I'm looking at you :D
One word: Oida
It can be used in basically every situation
The EU wants to stop us though and they started to tax us even on tiny homemade amounts
this could also be austria
Second that
Well, it is not something I ever experienced abroad, at least not to the same degree
Considering most people don't live in a house, there is a huge reliance on public spas if you wanna go to sauna
You have to pay before you distill
I mean if you don't count semi-detached houses as houses then you're right
Otherwise the EU-28 average of people living in flats is [42%]
was about to write a suder-answer about how everyone here is sudering all day long and that it's not even debatable, when I realised your comment was meant as a joke, and I perfectly fit into the Austrian stereotype lol
whoops haha
Yeah but shared Sauna means it's not only for you hence Corona might cause people to use it less
No license needed
You want to distill x amount of mash, which will turn out to be ~y litres of pure alcohol
You pay taxes on every litre of pure alcohol you will get
[Wurstsemmel]
Käsekrainer
Leberkässemmel
Probably the "Leberkäsesemmel". It's a bread with meatloaf inside of it
Well, I don't eat those, but many Austrians do
Fuck yeah, just had some a few weeks ago and they
are
off
the
hook
Not to forget Schnitzelsemmel, Bosna and Kafka
Bosna
Kaisersemmel -
it is not a fast food (but you can put a cold Schnitzel in the Semmel instead of Wurst making it a Schnitzelsemmel)
Käsekrainersemmel
Not really a thing
Hahaha
Yea
Lüneburg
It is not odd, but just not that wide-spread
I would think that this person is having conservative or right wing political views or they bought it for an international sports tournament
Depends on how it is displayed
No, but it's not too common
Usually found with people who don't have too much else to be proud of
If I see someone fly an Austrian Flag I automatically assume they are right wing or at least conservatives
It\`s sometimes seen in the countryside but I have never seen one in the city I live
&#x200B;
Also, is it weird that I have an EU Flag on my wall
What do you think about that
Same in Austria
I am on the political left and I like the country
I am very happy about being born here and I value the opportunities that were offered to me highly
With all its flaws it still made me, me
I think it's a bit of a pity we let the right folks occupy the flag
I like the top comment in this thread by the danish guy, that it's just a neutral statement that is used by everyone and not just right-wingers
>  displaying a European flag is the counter to this and can be used to neutralise the negative association
That's why I found my new home there
Only on the national holidays, it's usually the municipals which decorate the streets and public buildings with it
Not really
If you count soccer tournaments
then still no because we usually don't make it into them
Only government owned buildings do
The few people who do flag their private homes for national holidays tend to be the uber-patriotic kind
Only on public buildings, if
The action of showing pride of your nation through symbols is somewhat tainted by history in Germany and Austria
It just has a 'wrong' feeling to it (assuming you're not far right)
I bet lots of Germans and Austrians of my generation (early 90s) know exactly what I mean with this feeling
> We use it for private celebrations too, like birthdays
That would be so weird in Austria
Or on their trucks
Eh, I don't really see the point of taking pride in nationality
If I'm gonna be proud of something, it's gonna be an actual accomplishment of mine, not being born within an arbitrary set of geographical boundaries
The way I usually hear people phrase it (me included) is that they're glad to be Austrian, rather than proud
(Some people, that is
A lot of Austrians would rather cut off a limb than be caught offering anything but complaints about Austria
I think for Austria it‘s actually something really unexpected: [Hermann Maiers crash in Nagano]
I guess every Austrian knows this picture
> My personal favorite is a collection of photos by Bruno Barbey that shows Poland during the 80s. My heart clenches everytime I see the photo of the grandma at Auschwitz gates
These are incredible
Some of them look like they're from the 1880s and not the 1990s. Incredible to see how much progress has happend in just 40 years
> (google translate tells me this is the translation but it sounds very weird to me)
Better source for such translations is to look it up on wikipedia and switch languages which leads to (Austrian) State Treaty (or use a proper dictionary like leo
org or dict
cc)
[I think you meant this image
[Also, we should never forget this one
I had [this] in mind, but you're probably right
Mhm actually I know the other one, but I don't recognise this picture
This makes me feel proud of my country and our public transport
For Norway it's special that the king took the tram in 1973, here we have weekly posts of the president in a tram or the metro
> or use a proper dictionary like leo
org or dict
Those are user generated internet dictionaries
I'd say a proper dictionary would be Langenscheidt or Pons or OED or whatever
Which isn't to say those internet dictionaries are bad per se
They are very practical, but sometimes not as extensive as you'd like them to be
Source: studied English, have used my fair share of different dictionaries
Another tip: Wiktionary is a great user generated online tool for etymologies
The non plus ultra for etymology semantic history of words in English is the Oxford English Dictionary, but you need to to either pay for it, or a VPN from certain Austrian unis (Uni Wien for example)
So if you need to know something quickly, wiktionary is where you wanna go
That wikipedia trick is fantastic though, I usually do that when I want to know the name of a plant or animal or something specific like in this case the Staatsvertrag in various languages, because it also features a picture
Your both right
Both are iconic images
I'd also add [this picture] to the list
November 12th 1918, the proclamation of the 1st Republic in front of the Parliament in Vienna
[I had that one mind
The Austrian Republic was reestablished on April 27th 1945
The state treaty reestablished Austria as a fully independent country and ended allied occupation
The last soldiers left the country on the eve of the 25th of October 1955, part of the British forces
On the following day the parliament passed the neutrality law, an inofficial concession to the USSR for their agreement to the state treaty
The only thing i can think of is that we are to small of a country and therefore market for a lot of the biggest companies to care about us
Luckily we have Germany as big neighbor with the same language so we can leech their stuff
Without that we wouldn’t get dubbed movies, websites, operating systems and so on in our language
Other than those first world problems i really can‘t complain except on pricing of real estate maybe
Question: How rampant is corruption in small things over there
Does it start at a "you have to bribe that policeman or that small government official" level or is it more of a "the ones on the top will split things up among themselves".
Because that's how I think it is in Austria: trying to bribe a policeman
Have fun in court, cause you will be in deep trouble
Make sure a buddy will get a good contract while letting it appear 100% legal
Yep, that's the Austrian way of corruption
Ditto on the money department
same everywhere in europe basically impossible for students coming from out of the city to get their own apartment without payment from parents, neoliberal goal achieved
Is het zo erg
Ik ben er alleen maar 2-3 keer per jaar en woon de rest van het jaar in Oostenrijk
Ik vond altijd dat Nederland het schoonste land van alle was
You're already the second Swede I have seen on Reddit to complain about this
Having lived in Sweden, I agree that it is hard to do things with people spontaneously
However, it is quite similar in Austria imo
You often hear the typical "I can't do now unfortunately, but what about next week
Yes, I'm very grateful to live in Austria and basically exploit Germany for all the germanized things
What I wouldn't give to have our own language, so we could watch movies the way they're intended and not with all characters sounding like they're from Germany
Luckily there is a cinema in my city that plays all movies non-dubbed
>The lower wages, compared to some of the neighbouring countries, for educated people and the omnipresent jealousy/disdain for educated people with higher wages
Thats interesting, because i (grown up in Austria) always just viewed Slovenia as the  ex eastern-bloc/yugoslav country with the highest wages Think it was the first fact i knew about it
Used to just think of Slovenia as rich Slovakia (until i learned more about the countries, forgive my ignorance :P )
I pay 16€ for 25GB with 15GB of those usable in EU and Switzerland
It is a youth plan though, I think the standard price would be 25€.
I'm glad I live this side of the border when it comes to phone plans
Gonna add onto that one french guy below me: 48 countries with different histories, technological standards along with academical standards are never the same
its the same in austria, i can basically forget going to university if my parents werent ready to support me which they thankfully are
What do you mean by that
Didn't quite get what you meant, but I don't think Austria gets more international media attention than Denmark, I think they're pretty similar in impact
Oh ok
Daarvan merk ik niet veel
Ben meestal op het bootje boven in Friesland
Misschien geeft het ook verschillen tussen de provincies
The mediterrenean is always bluer on the other side
No I can't think of anything too similar to your story
The only time I remember a death being announced during a TV show was that of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination
It happened at night though (like 10
30 pm) so Golden Girls was on (not a kids show)
It was just an insert and it said more details would be given in a special news broadcast after the current show
Seeing as I still remember it I guess it made an impact on me as a kid but it's not a widespread experience that anybody talks about anymore
The death if the public figure itself wasn't unique to my country, nor was the program that was interrupted for it
But still, the event was special enough for little me to remember it even almost two decades later
On Saturday, April 2nd 2005, the Austrian TV station ORF1 showed Dreamwork's Shrek in their 20:15 timeslot
Roughly an hour later, just when the montage with the song Hallelujah playing in the background was playing, the film was interrupted indefinitely because of an important message: Pope John Paul II had died
Two days later, we'd talk about it in class
All my 9 year old class mates and I *really* cared about however, was that the movie had been interrupted
The event for some reason popped into my head a few weeks ago, and I mentioned it to my friends
Surprisingly, they also remembered that Shrek being interrupted because the Pope died
That time when the Ibiza scandal was made public though :D
I think it is fortunate that we are able to live in such a time
I still think it is exceptional that one of the most important european friendship is between France and Germany nowadays
After having such a long and fierce history of wars with each other, this for me is one of the most beautiful political advancements of the past 70 years
Seeing Mitterand and Kohl holding hands at Verdun still gives me goosebumps
I always get reminded of that fact when I visit Prague
I live in Vienna and what you often find here in the inner districts, seemingly completely random between the beautiful old buildings, are ugly newer ones
These are the places were misguided bombs hit
These holes had to be filled quickly with cheaply built houses after the war
I actually don't see such obvious "Bombenlöcher" that often in Prague, which otherwise feels very similar to Vienna
I actually live in one of those buildings, which I often curse when I try to drill holes in the wall to mount stuff
They are made of debris from the ruins (cheap material found on the streets back then) and would sometimes have huge junks falling out
Anyway, it reminds me that Vienna was bombed more than other cities and I sometimes try to connect this thought with the stories my grandparents tell about that time
Kind of
I can‘t imagine not traveling anywhere and maybe hearing war planes fly over your house/country and being scared that they might come for you this time
But I can imagine my country being ruled by the Habsburg monarchy easily for whatever reason, and war is a given for me during that time
Seeing their weapons, their methods on how they attacked others/protected themself really did give me an insight on how war might‘ve been, and it doesn‘t feel all that strange (I still would never wish it upon anybody)
Memories of Barney or memories war, both sounds terrible in its own way
Imagine how terrible it must be for those Iraqis who were tortured by the US army with the Barney intro song on full volume for hours
For them the memories of Barney and war will be forever intertwined
We have siren tests every Saturday at noon
However they are often used for the voluntary firebrigade and have 2 other uses
Basically just go inside and watch the public television service, radio or nowadays the Internet
Pretty sure it is not effective against air strikes, as of now
Yeah, in Austria it's every Saturday at noon
It's quite short, really just checking if the thing's working
I was quite surprised to learn that not every country does it
For beer we use the Seidl and Krügerl
Nowadays they're defined as 0,3l and 0,5l but they're derived from pre-metric measurements
For firewood some regions still use the Klafter, derived from the arm length
We have the Decker which is 10 grams
It's still fairly commonly used
"Deka"(short) or "Dekagramm" (englisch decagram) for 10 g. Technically it is SI conform (and can even be abbreviated as "dag") but you won't usually see it
Mainly used for shopping, e.g. meat
We sometimes use some weird metric based units like dekagramm (or just deka)
For a long time (farm)land was measured in "morgen" (translated literally "morning") which meant the amount  of land a single farmer could use on a single day
But what kind of stone
Cubic decimeter of granite or something
Because just stone is inprecise
Also Pfiff for 0,2l (or half a Seidl, varies regionally)
Ster for a m³ of stacked wood
Klafter for 3 m³ of stacked wood
We also have dekagramm (dag) , which is 10g.
It's Deka and is short for Dekagramm (10 grams) which is just like saying Kilo for Kilogramm (1000 grams)
A Festmeter isn't stacked
A Festmeter is a m³ of solid wood
Stacked wood is Schichtmeter or Ster
A Klafter is 3 Ster
Then there is also Schüttmeter for a m³ in a pile
Akropolis in Athens, Kathedral in Cologne, Tower Bridge in London, Collosseum in Rome, Red Square in Moscow, Notre Dame in Paris and Castle Hohensalzburg in Salzburg

Seven wonders was the question
Don’t see where Auschwitz is a wonder
And by the way you completely vitiated your own point
You said „cultural heritage“ and Auschwitz is not a cultural heritage of Europe because our culture doesn’t include gassing people to their fucking death
If Auschwitz is what you think of when you hear culture, you should visit more real cultural heritage sites to remind yourself what our culture really is about
We don’t tear the place down, that’s what we do to remind people of the atrocities that happened there
Why else would we let it be there
The thought is that people go there and think of all the terrible things humans did to other humans there, and not people go there to say: Oh wow what a great place it’s truly one of the 7 wonders of Europe
Of course people need to hear about it
But it’s not a cultural wonder
What has a concentration camp to do with European culture
Is it our culture to gas people to death
You have to understand the difference between culture and history
It’s a historical monument, no question about that
But it’s not a cultural heritage
This is really not how culture works but fine, you do you
Living in a catholic country
It's good to have more holidays than the neighboring countries like Germany ;)
Suddenly I'm super happy about our Nordsee stores
Matjesbaguette is great
Am I allowed to mentioned stores that are not originally European
Because then I'd like to have a Chipotle here, so we get at least *some* Mexican food
Be the change you wish to see:
> Leberkas-Pepi from Austria
There's not even enough Leberkas Pepi *within* Austria
I just love it
They used to have a store in London, but I think it didn't go that well
But I could imagine it would go really well in Czechia or Slovakia
They could test the waters in Prague or maybe even Budweis (not too far from the home base in Linz), and then expand to Brno
I have to have a Mohnflesserl with Käseleberkäse every couple of weeks
It's a must
> Also in Vienna in particular its one of the cheapest ways to eat out while still getting a taste of the hearty Austrian cuisine
Käsekrainer is another great option
Even at the most upscale places it's usually under €4-5
Linz isn't that far away from Czechia, so it should be fairly easy to get it to Czechia
No, because nobody says "email". Everyone just says "mail". So you'd replace a shorter word with a longer one, which does not make sense
Also at least here there is tons of other email providers, so it's not like gmail would have a that dominant position
Nope
At work it's still like 100% MS Outlook
And in the private sector gmail and hotmail are like 45:45 in my area
With the remaining 10% being a few local distributors
So the overall market share isn't really that high
And I never heard somebody say "gmail me this". That would be weird
Not a thing in Austrian German
Probably because saying "dschie-mehl" is more awkward to fit into a normal German sentence than the standard "ii-mehl". Most people just shorten it to mail ("mehl") anyway, which can be turned into a verb as well ("mail mir etwas", mail me something)
That would sound wrong with "gmail" though
Also from a usage standpoint: While many people do have Gmail accounts, especially in their private life, still you'd be excluding everyone who uses a different provider (gmx, yahoo, work email address, ...)
So, in short: the original word "e-mail" is already short and has been shortened further to "mail", so there's no reason to make it longer again while also excluding people, and use gmail instead
>Also at least here there is tons of other email providers
A ton
What did I miss
There's the occasional tech illiterate hotmail or gmx user who didn't migrate over yet (read: my mom), but gmail has a clear market lead
Where I live everybody says email and not mail
And also GMX is still quite popular in Austria and Germany
Using other providers than gmail has nothing to do with being tech illiterate, and of course all company email has custom domains on top
What
I get about 150 mails a day, and 90% of them are sent over business servers with the company's domain name as adress
Lots of people use their internet providers mail, especially if they stick with the same company they started with (or it's original name) - tons of @ chello for example
any work email address using your company's domain name, for example
apart from that it's mostly gmail and gmx, hotmail, yahoo though, I'll concede that
You forget all the branded business mail adresses running via Outlook
hello gugu
Not anymore
All new addresses are gmail and have been since 2012 when google gained the rights
People with googlemail do have the option to switch to a gmail ending and I think most do or did, but sometimes I still see the rare googlemail address
oh yeah ... I still got GMX ... and one of their joke domain addresses as well :D
I've still got a GMX account from back when I was a kid
It has just my name so it's not like it's inappropriate to use, but what annoys me very much is the GMX Newsletter you get every couple of weeks and that they build in ads that look like like new mails in your inbox
Honestly, if it weren't for the couple of friends and acquaintances who occasionally send mails to that address I would've gotten rid of it already
yeah, of course, but those are two vastly different cases
If your business uses a gmail adress, that doesn't sound too good, man
haha
I thought this goes without saying, but I was talking about private users
works same for many other things, mostly in the technical sector that is full of loan words
we can call a hard disk just "disk", because we have our own word if we just mean the shape
etc
etc
Just have whatever other email provider you use pull the mails from gmx via POP3
Easy as that
You can unsubscribe the newsletter
For the people I know: because they got these addresses since a _long_ time and there is no nice available name on gmail any more
And before I'd have [some-stupid-username]@gmail
com I'd rather stick with a nice [firstname
lastname]@gmx
at or something, even if it goes to some gmail account in the brackground
How is that obvious
Also ich kenn keine größere Firma die ihre Mails über Gmail o.ä. verschickt
Die betreiben alle ihre eigenen Server (bzw
zahlen wen dafür)
That's what I'm doing currently, but I still haven't figured out how to not receive the spam newsletter
POP
Whst century are you living in
I've tried
I cannot
Viele der grossen US UNis verwenden gmail
Von aussen merkst davon natuerlich nichts weils alls @uni
edu adressen sind aber unter der Haube rennt Gmail
Yeah, that one is a little annoying, but it directly gets filtered into the spam folder for me, so it's only a minor nuisance \^\^
good enough if you just need emails fetched from somewhere
Weird, I've a gmx account, too, and don't get the newsletter ... can you tag it as spam or something
I use a gmx
at account and in my account settings it says (in German) that [I cannot unsubscribe because it's part of being a free user
Is yours gmx
net or gmx
Edit: words
Ahhh that explains it, totally forgot about that possibility
I've got a paid account
Lol, well that explains that
I was already getting really worked up because I thougt some accounts get the newsletter and others don't.
Germany, Czechia, Turkey/Ottomans, Hungary and France probably
As for Austria:
* Germany (duh)
* Hungary probably a whole bunch
* Italy maybe bc of WW1 and WW2
* Russia maybe too bc those guys really
wanted to have our country badly after WW2
* Lastly I‘d say either a lil bit of Serbia or a lil bit of Entente overall (if that counts) bc they equally divided Austria into 4 parts from 1945-1955
Edit: Ok
I forgot that Austria-Hungary also had Czechia (and that Prague was the capital of Austria-Hungary for some time before Vienna) and many parts of Poland as property, so maybe just cross out the last one and insert Czechoslowakia or smth
Germany (are really close to it, nearly ended up as a part of it)
France (culture, whole history of Europe, important aristocratic ties)
Italy (commerce, culture)
Hungary (organizationally the most important part of the empire except Austria)
Czechia (culturally also a very close part of the empire)
As always with questions that deal with both history and nations, this is kinda hard when you want to include some areas that aren't even "countries" right now but used to be back then (Bavaria, Salzburg, etc), as well as all ex crown dependencies
You totally forgot about Italy
But as a matter of fact, I would say that since we used to rule that much of Europe, the whole continent is somehow important historically (not only the regions we used to rule, but also those who were our rivals and enemies during these times)
I'd say Germany, Italy, Hungary, Russia, Turkey
Depends on how we count the former parts of the Austrian empire though
In my eyes this is online gambling
It should be treated as such (which basically means it is exempt from the shared market and requires a dedicated license in each country)
yes
it's nothing more than a way to get ppl to pay more for the mostly full price game
Its a form of gambling in my mind and should therefore fall under those laws
That would *maybe* be true if the games weren't built to make you want those extras
Its subtle but extremely effective manipulation
Heck, I work in a gambling company and its a fucking huuuge pain in the ass for us already (and in a bunch of countries you don't even get licenses because they got a state monopoly - like in Germany or Austria)
And we got nothing better to do with our time, while game dev studios (I hope) actually spend their time developing games
Yeah nobody likes fungus
It's coarse and it's rough and it gets everywhere
Sure, it's from Star Trek
>A good example would be German
Your point is moot, as German dialects are already dying out
Please stop pretending being pro-EU and being pro-EU-federalization are the same thing lmao
pro Europe doesn't mean pro EU federation
South of what
Germany
Ever been to Munich in the last decades lol
When you look at r/okoidawappler and r/aeiou you'll find the expected memes about Austrian politicians and celebrities (like [this one] which is a play on our presidents name Van der Bellen and a soft drink called Fanta) but also memes about fictional characters from different TV shows, books or ads, like Tom Turbo, Kasperl and Baumaxerl
But I can't really think of a specific meme template that stuck around for longer and only in Austrian subreddits
i liked the "cow of the river" memes, but they are just a austrian verion of panzer of the lake
probably every single scene from the very good documentary series "Der Pennymarkt auf der Reeperbahn"?
„Nehmen Sie das sofort herunter
Was soll das
“ / english:
„Take that down immediately, what are you doing
There was a leak in a database and a guy on twitter posted the private adress of an austrian politician, then she twittered the above sentence
It quickly became a meme, the above one is funny because you are not supposed to put gravy on your schnitzel
The only memes I can think of are either german or not really memes
Maybe calling [Sebastian Kurz ] (a politician) [Dumbo]
Austria:
The "Baumaxerl" is just the icon of a wood/constructionshop and he essentially commits horrendous warcrimes
I hope "Nehmen Sie das sofort herunter
Was soll das
" will live on
>But I can't really think of a specific meme template that stuck around for longer and only in Austrian subreddits
Genau das Gegenteil ist der Fall ;)
Mit freundlichen Grüßen
it’s mostly phrases like "Jetzt erst recht" or "THC Strache" that are used ironically they ain’t real templates tho
I've seen Swedish versions, det er fredag mina bekanter
Well theoretically we Austrians could
But we have our own way of saying that
Red deitsch du wappla
Yeah that would be one of the variants
Haha
I would say Switzerland
It's like a rivalry on the same level
Even though the Swiss german is quite hard to understand we can it if we really try
Besides we have also the Alps in common and the love for wintersport
For me Germany feels like the  older brother, we look up to them and know everything about them but in the other way around the just think It the small brother they are just cute with their dialects and nice with the landscape but otherwise the don't know to much
Many would say Germany, but a 100% no
Switzerland seems right although many Swiss people would probably say Germany or France
Not a country but i would say for Austria it's Bravia
We have a lot in common like dialect, culture, landscape and we both hate the rest of germany
I'd say Hungary, but as anyhwere, it really depends on the region
Germany feels really distant to me
Definitely France, because we don't talk to the Swiss and the Germans are our puppet state (just kidding)
No srsly this answer is rather complex for Austria
So I will try:
Language wise: Germany and Switzerland
Culturally: Czechia, Slovenia and Bavaria
Mentality: Czechia, Slovenia, Hungary and Italy
To cite wikipedia on the Austria-Czech relation:
> In 2008, [Karl Schwarzenberg] (Czech minister of foreign affairs) and [Jiri Grusa] who has acted as Czech ambassador and as director of the [Diplomatic Academy in Vienna] shared the opinion that Austrians and Czechs are of different language, but of "the same nation", the same character
[\[2\]] .
Germany
We have a very intimate love-hate relationship
-Austria
>Even though the Swiss german is quite hard to understand we can it if we really try
Except you are from Vorarlberg than it's easy
well you don't even border us so that makes sense
That’s not really true though
Vorarlberg mostly speak Alemannic and they are culturally pretty similar to BW
Vorarlberg is language wise actually closer to BaWü than Bavaria and have a direct connection over the Bodensee
The rest is Bavaria of course
You still have many places in Baden-Württemberg with the Austrian flag in their coat of arms from the good ol' Outer Austria days
That's gotta count for something
I just wanted to say "How does your military help Lichtenstein during an invasion if Lichtenstein is actually invaded BY your military" :D
Well I guess only Südtirol yes, whole Italy definitely not
We regard the Swiss closer to you guys than to us, because there isn't much of a relationship between Austria and Switzerland funnily enough
I think Switzerland is like the guy in the village which is related to everybody but prefers to be alone
Huh
You're either oversensitive or my wording might have been bad, but I didn't want to imply anything like that
I just wanted to say that from my perspective Germany's and Switzerland's relationship seems much closer than the Austrian-Swiss one
Germany is obviously the country closest to "being a brother" to us
A minor correction here: We mostly distance us from the northern part which stems back to the historic rivalry between Prussia and Austria
The word "Piefke" actually refers to the Prussians not Germans in general
Most Austrians love Southern Germans and see them one one footing especially Bavaria
But even with the northern part it's more like a "frienemy" relationship today than actual hate
We Austrians don't take most things that seriously and it's more jokingly
Man könnte fast sagen das dir das Spanisch vorkommt

Ah a Hawara vo Kuitur
Austria and Germany shares a lot of old wedding traditions, but I want to explain a decent, unusual one
It's called "Brautstehlen"  or "Steal the bride".
Normally it is done on the countryside and right before the wedding
Some guests/good friends attempt to kidnap the bride with the groom not noticing, taking her to one bar/place to drink, dance and sing
The groom has to find her, usually until then everyone drank a lot already and the soon-to-be husband has to pay for the drinks to get her back
It's a bit annoying because you have to get ready for the wedding afterwards, but at least everyone is in a relaxed mood and doesn't take everything seriously
Stealing the bride
At some point of the evening somebody "kidnaps" your newly wed wife and you have to do a scavenger hunt through the are that normaly ends in paying a large bar tab somewhere for half the invited people at some local bar
I think „Braut stehlen“ (Bride stealing) is exclusive to my country (?)
I haven’t married nor have I ever been to a wedding, but I think I know the concept of bride stealing - if somebody knows better feel free to correct me
So the couple marries and after the ceremony all the guests go together to a restaurant
However, during the drive there, it may be that the car where the bride is in drives to a different restaurant or bars to basically get drunk
The groom and his car have to drive after them and find them, if they’re unlucky they also have to pay for everything the bride and her friends drunk
The bride and her friends drive to as many different restaurants/bars as they can before getting caught by the groom and his friends
It even occurred once (my parents have a restaurant and the wedding meal took place in that restaurant) that the groom doesn‘t find the bride nor her friends at all and has to search for her the whole evening
:‘D It‘s a quite funny/weird thing and if you own a restaurant you get a lot of money out of it lol
Edit: Sometimes it‘s also done before the wedding
I saw your post after I finished typing mine
In Austrian we do the same, except you always go out drinking with the bride and get the groom to pay for everything to get her back
We have that in Austria too, but it happens during the wedding festivities, so at some point in the night
After the ceremony the wedding party usually moves to a tavern/inn/hostelry (I don't think there's a proper translation for Wirtshaus) and the main event takes place in the "ballroom", the biggest room
The bride is kidnapped by family members to another room in the tavern and to get to her the groom has to fulfill multiple tasks, like walking over the long table and giving a kiss to every woman and having a drink with every man sitting at it until he can reach his bride at the end of it
Like the copperto in Italy
In German, Kuvert means envelope too
You are spot on with the etymology btw
Add a simplified/modernized version of our emblem eagle
Austro-Hungarian flag is pretty nice I think, tho without Hungary it would be very pointless
I wouldn‘t change it much, just make the eagle mandatory
It bothers me that the eagle is only on the flags of the Hofburg and polictians, but barely anywhere else
(Or maybe just throw the eagle out as a whole)
I don't think I would change anything
The red-white- red combo is very very old, dating back to the 12th
century bc
It has since then always been a part of Austria in some kind, be it as official flag or as part of the Habsburg coat of arms
So, no change needed imo
i think that emblem is a little bit too complex to be on a flag
i would remove the one from slovak flag too
but then it's Russia :P slovak flag needs a redesign
Also pretty sure your southern states would not really appreciate that, because they got fuck-all to do with the nordic countries
And even for northern Germany it's a stretch
I like the latvian flag, maybe a little brighter red and a thicker white stripe and it’s perfect
One of the old (K.u.K) double eagles would also be cool ... But not really fitting since we aren't a monarchy :/
Clean it all up with a Union
No, generally kids don't pay rent as a point of principle, especially if the parents own the property
It depends on the economic situation of the parents too of course, but charging the kids rent if you're wealthy as it is and the rent barely registers on the bank account anyway just seems cruel tbh
For poor folks this doesn't apply of course, if the parents really need the money for something that isn't luxury, it's fair enough to charge rent
Don't think that's common
Maybe if you got a job and they want to kick you out but otherwise
I moved in and out of the country quite a lot, every time I move back I stay at my parents place until I find my own place and they never charged any rent
I had to google this because I had no clue and didn‘t find anything related to it so I think, sadly, no, we do not have a national pet
We do have a national animal tho
It‘s the black eagle
Found on our [flag] too
Isn't it rather that there's a Prime Minister at Downing Street in London where the cat lives
Funny, this post is about pets, and then I see pictures of polar bears and octopuses
yes, I learned swedish after learning norwegian, and it was the most surprising thing to hear swedes say that norwegian goes so much up and down with the melody
I think swedish does that even more
though it depends on the norwegian dialect
Well most people hear German in context of military in war movies, plus standard German sounds very different to most of the dialects
case in point, even hitler [sounded nice when he was not screaming]
Well there may be some truth to that: [
Edit: [
Star Wars Episode 2 and it's said by Anakin Skywalker
It's a [masterpiece]
I know, but my sister in law and some colleages, which are turks, also told me that they can easily understand some parts of Japanese, and although I know that the theory is controversal, I hear this again and again
Oh damn it, didn't see that
Thank you Turkey for introducing coffee to Vienna, even if that wasn't the plan
The Soviet Union and Stalin for instigating the talks and using his political capital so that we were able to become a neutral republic and not occupied or split like Germany
Thank you France for Robert Schumann
Is there something I can read up on this ? Because I'm really interested in learning more about this
If I may ask, social role in what sense
Stalin actually tried to do the same thing with Germany
But the Americans wanted to win the cold war, so they were against it
> Soviet leader Joseph Stalin put forth a proposal for a reunification and neutralization (in the sense of being neutral) of Germany, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for "the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly" and free activity of democratic parties and organizations

When i lived in a house with my parents the doors would be locked only during night
I moved to an apartment, and no one ever locked doors except for when nobody was home
Usually not
The door doesn't open from the outside without a key anyway
Growing up, we'd lock the front door at night and when going out, and it would not lock automatically, so you could just walk in
That's common in the countryside
Living in a city flat, the door locks automatically, I only lock it with my keys when going out
My partner's parents in the UK do not have a self-locking door and always lock the door manually AND REMOVE the keys and take them into the next room
I hate it
The number of times I have tried to pop outside real quick only to realise that I have no idea where the keys are and that I would have no way of getting out if there was a fire is scary
On the countryside in Austria this is different
There are almost no self locking doors here
I know everyone has one in the city
We had the same
My parents didn't lock their cars until the cars got the remotes and became self locking
The garage didn't even have a door
Tiny village in Northern Germany
Don’t your doors lock automatically when you close them
I thought that was standard here
On the countryside it's not like that
At least in Austria
If you don't manually lock it with a key, self-locking doors are incredibly easy to get into
Yeah, it is
But you get used to always having your key with you
I once locked myself out of my apartment and had to climb in through the balcony
Luckily the balcony door was open
>If you forget your keys inside you're fucked
If you don't manually lock it, it's not really locked
You can get inside with a credit card or a similar tool
>There are almost no self locking doors here
They are getting more and more common
I don't see any new homes without self locking doors
And people also upgrade their old doors to self locking
I had both
Honestly  i hate the self-locking ones
Opening the lock in case i forget my keys inside is probably roughly as expensive as anything someone would actually steal from my apartment, and roughly 200 times more likely
>The door needs keys to open from the inside
Yes
A properly locked door will always need a key to open it
Regardless of inside or outside
Yes, when locked by key it needs a key to unlock it
Who would
Do people really drop by without calling first
>Wait, you can open your main door from outside without a key
Have you ever seen a door handle
They do exactly that
*Almost* noone has a self locking door
I know the doors of all my ~15 neighbor houses and only one of them has a self locking door
Aber ich kann auch nur das beurteilen, das ich kenne
Also was weiß ich
Das von dem Haus in dem ich wohne ist auch nicht selbstschließend
>So if you walk out of the house without your key, you’re automatically locked out
The door won't open without a key, but its not really locked
You can open it in a few seconds with a credit card or something similar
Even the ultra expensive "secured against credit cards" locks are really easy to open with a credit card
New homes
I have not seen a house built in the last 15 years that doesn't have an automatically locking door
Maybe if the owners really cheap out on the door
Ah ok
Honestly, i dont think that ever happens
Obviously, break ins do happen here, but they almost always target family-homes in villages, when the occupants arent there
They are easier targets, theres more to gain, and its easy to check if the occupants are there
Or sometimes they clear basements and the like
Maybe an apartment if its really obvious that nobody is home
I think the probability of someone just walking into my apartment is about zero
What burglar would be insane enough to just randomly walk into apartments
I understand the feeling though - i always lock at night, not even because i think anything could happen, just because it feels nice
> but I'm not aware of handles installed outside a front door
They were by far the most common option here until quite recently
And they still are in many parts of the world
You had automatically locking doors in the 1950s? On single family homes
Meine Nachbarn haben alle ziemlich neue Häuser ~13 Jahre
Nur einer mit automatisch sperrender Tür dabei
Bin auch in der Baubranche hab jetzt aber nie bewusst auf Türen geachtet
> For most front doors I have seen this wouldn't work
It does
You have to bend the card around one or two corners
Its easier than you think
Even works on really expensive "credit card proof" locks
If you don‘t manually lock the door, it isn‘t really locked
Interessant
Ich sehe fast nur automatisch sperrende Türen bei Neubauten
Nicht selbstsperrende Türen bekommt man eigentlich kaum mehr
Wenn man in die Kataloge schaut sind beinahe alle Türen selbstsperrend
Just as an aside, Austrian English speaker tend to pronounce the initial voiced th (as in "the") as d rather than s. So it would be:
*Dschohn mäid his wäi tu ä täwan zru de dark forest, onli tu feind aut dät hie vorgott* ^(I like how you changed the f to a v, so it resembles "vergessen" more closely) *de manni*
Having ð is like cheating
Well I laughed out loud in the middle of a cafe because of the fanny
I hate you
And thanks for the laugh
> not a translation
I personally would also write "fru" instead of "zru", but that probably depends on if you're used to a more British or American pronounciation
Austrian German speakers tend to replace it with "d" rather than "s"
Yeah true
I'd say that my English speaking skills are pretty good, but the *thr(V)* constellation still is hard for me
Like three or through
Like, the tongue has to move from the very front to the very back of the mouth in an instant
>This why there is Y in Ye Olde

Yanks a lot
I know

And some islamic countries are now actually boycotting french product
You know what
The EU should stick together and start to actively boycot any country that stands against France in this matter
Lets see how much these countries love it without german cars, engineering and other stuff
Unfortunately this is never going to happen, because the EU will never stand together in such a matter
No actions but some words of shock and then going back to normal
Thoughts and prayers of the EU kind, so to say
It´s good for France and Macron to stand their ground
I only wished the rest of the EU had the balls to actively support you
stabbings happen a lot
Just because the killer was a muslim doesn't make it more horrible
The thing in france with the teacher is diffetent
It's not
Was pretty prominent in the news Austria
Where are you from
Really depends
Snow if there is a bunch of it at once and it is cold enough for it to stay, its fine
But what I truely hate is snow-melting-snow-melting if it is too warm during the day and you end up with snowslush and salt-dirt mixture every other day
I'd even prefer -20 to that
It´s not even only Turkey, I think Qatar, Jordan and other countries also removed french products from their supermarkets
As I said, if the EU had actual balls (which we know they don´t have), they would stop exporting goods to these countries as a whole
Wanna see these Qataris squrim when they don´t get their Mercedes, BMW and other luxury cars or even replacement parts
I wonder how the people react now after the pope told to not discriminate the homosexuals
I bet #NotMyPope
In Austria, i‘d say they are all pretty equal
But we have a rather small but special one for technical fields for mountain industries „Montan University“ in Leoben
Which is pretty neat
The TU (Technical University) is one of the most prestigious ones here
It is considered to be rather old-fashioned and difficult, but if you graduate you definitely achieved something in life
Law as well
STEM is mostly done at universities too
Slovenia is nice, but it's so similar to Austria in many aspects that it's kinda underwhelming as a destination
Well if I had to pick one I'd say latvia, but it's more me not knowing much about the country and it's history than the country itself being uninteresting, i feel like it's just overshadowed in a way by it's two baltic neighbours as well
Many people seem to love Ireland but it's one of the most uninteresting countries in Europe for me and I don't really consider visiting it
Please don't take offense to this, but if I had to choose probably Slovenia
But I think that's only because we have a lot of big and famous neighbouring countries, so it doesn't get that much limelight
ah don't sell yourself short, you have great places to go skiing
I think there's some beautiful and super well preserved Byzantine Churches in N. Macedonia
Other than that I got nothing
The best thing about denmark is the small hippie-zone of kristiania somewhere in copenhagen
We had a sea connection, we had plenty of excitement
Hell are we happy we are boring in this age around
Still there are a few things from not so boring times that one could find interesting
I find England to be very dull to visit, but I think that is because I have been many times and there is little new for me to see
British history however I find fascinating
It's history is so distant to the super entwined history of the continent it often seems like a different world entirely
Gor example, the invasions of the British Isles seem much more invasive as, being an island, it has very clearly defined borders
It's a strange little microcosm, with similar historical events as the European continent condensed on to an island smaller than Germany
To be fair, Vienna is probably the most interesting vacation spot in the country
Sure, there's Tyrol and Carinthia with their alps (and probably some others too but I am from that region) and other cities, but let's be real, Vienna takes the win
It's just that there are tons of countries I'm much more interested in
Nope, there are so many countries I'd rather go to
> Austrian Hangarian Empire
> Habsburg Empire
Potato potato
In Austrian German you can replace "bitte" with "schnell" pretty often without sounding rude
At least when talking to family&friends
"Kannst mir schnell das Salz geben"
"Kannst mir bitte das Salz geben"
The Ibiza scandal shows that we're trying really hard, but we're just too stupid
&nbsp;
Sarcasm aside: corruption actually runs deep in Austria's political and public veins, but not the kind of in-your-face corruption you might think of, but a way more subtle kind, the kind where legal grey areas get exploited by those in power
Austria is also somewhat inert to change, so introducing stricter laws against it takes a lot of time
Almost like the people who profit from these loopholes don't want to give that up
The situation is a bit more complex and way deeper than I can possibly describe in a short comment and I'm sure it is "jammern auf hohem Niveau" in comparison to what other countries do, but by no means is Austria perfect and pure
We are only Corrupt in Ibiza
It depends wholly on the government
We've gone from right-wing coke-snorting, money bag hauling puppets of Russia to a temporary technocracy, to an entirely new government
We'll see what the new guys give us
Spoilers: The major party licks the big capitalist's boots and is potentially stuffed to all hell
The only useful constant throughout the past couple of years is our president, Van Der Bellen
This man has kept a cool mind and much needed composure while all this was going on
Have a look at the [Corruption Perceptions Index]
This is no way of talking about your democratically elected president and philanthrope Vladimir Putin
Same here
We call it "Freunderlwirtschaft" ("friends economy")
In many parts of bureaucracy you are getting things done much quicker if you have friends; or get public fundings or public contracts because you have friends
And since I am so grateful that my friend helped me, I will of course help him whenever I can
That's basically the mentality that a lot of people still have
Some of our most famous criminal cases involve deviations of that - for example, a guy lobbied inside a ministry for a bidder that wanted to buy public flats
Somehow* he got information on how high the bid of the competitor was, therefore his bidder could out-bid them and pay the lobbyist a lot of money
)* lobbyist was friends with multiple politicians
Prosecution says that the lobbyist then split the money that he got from the bidding company with said politicians; but there is no hard evidence
Yeah it is not the pay to that clerk to get a permit or to that one to process your paperwork in time corruption
But the finance minister invests his mother in law's money to (with some rich friends) buy that bank from a federal state to sell it to that german bank a day later kind of corruption
Or friends of that minister calling each other to understand what work it was that they got money from a company that bought a couple of thousand apartments from the state after increasing their offer to be less than 1% above the previously best offer
Edit: let me add as a disclaimer: i am not saying anything here is illegal, that would be for the courts to decide
>we're trying really hard, but we're just too stupid
This resonates with me
Why have I never heard that before
Best description of Austrian politics in general imho
Freunderlwirtschaft
And at the same time, if you want to do it honestly, you will drown and not be able to keep up
And since none of that is illegal there is no incentive to change
I don't think that was ever the case
For a long time however, you got a public-owned flat much faster if you were a SPÖ member
its more that people in city are more likely to vote for SPÖ so they invest more into cheap Gemeindebauten and thereby make people in cities more likely to vote SPÖ.
It's definitely a "disappointed, but not surprised" situation for me
Except for their core voters, who will vote for them regardless, they took an image hit
But people should have gone to jail, anti-corruption should have been made agenda #1, etc
You really got a taste of Karma

Serenade No
10 KV 361 by W.A. Mozart is one of them but I would answer with Mozart pieces in general
Here in Austria of course we also have pop music and good music from the 20th century (search for Austropop if you’re interested)
But for me nothing comes close in beauty and genius to Mozart
[Moneyboy - Dreh den Swag auf]
I'm from austria
Choose your favorite composer because there are to many beautiful pieces
Rondo alla turka (Turkish March, Türkischer Marsch) from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
> For my personally it would be Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata
Technically he composed that in Slovakia though
So you could say it "came out of" Slovakia
Amazing piece
I too love it
SILENCE GERMAN, don’t touch our precious Mozart
Mozart is from austria
Ma vlast by Smetana
I really like it
If you like Tallis and Vaughan Williams you have to love Vaughan Williams ' *Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis* It's a masterclass in orchestration and stunningly beautiful
Id say they arent really comparable, they are just way too different
Sorry but that's for a rather niche group
I really don't like that kind of Deutschrap but if you like it I won't judge you
Exactly
Most of them are really catchy tunes
Moneyboy is the new Mozart
Wenn du nach diesem Prinzip antwortest, dann wären auch alle heutigen Österreicher Deutsche, weil man sich vor 100 Jahren noch als solche gesehen hatte
Mozart wirkte aber die Mehrheit seines Lebens am österreichischen-kaiserlichen Hofe und in Salzburg, weshalb er nach heutiger Situation, aufgrund der neuen österreichischen Identität, ein Österreicher ist
Mozart was born in the Independent Bishopric of Salzburg
Seiler und Speer oida
He was, along with Mozart, but they don‘t seem to care
The Reichskreise were created by Maximilian of Austria for administrative reasons during the Reichsregiment and not at all a homogeneous territory
That‘s like saying the EU is a nation
1945
The last time you could consider (besides the Anschluss of course) Austria a German nation was in the German Confederation which disbanded with the Declaration of the German Empire
Furthermore, this confederation was already pretty loose
Are you sure you‘re not talking about the Anschluss right now that happened int 1938 that made Austria be german in the first place
Because in 1945 the Austria we know today, the second republic of Austria, came to life
Austria didn‘t just not exist until 1945 and just magically appeared from the remains of WW2
According to documents Ostarrichi was first mentioned int 996
What a stupid argument and comparison to Hitler
In case you forgot, the German people wanted Hitler as their Führer and he was the Führer of nazi GERMANY when he committed atrocities
How is Austria in any way responsible for it, when the Germans made him big
He was only born in Austria
He served under the German imperial army in WW1 while at the same time giving up his Austrian passport
Hitler is entirely Germany‘s fault
I don‘t want to start a fight, but I‘m surprised you say that, considering you‘re German
So Hitler really was German, thank you for confirming that
Now that I know that, Pfiat di
Toll, das ist genau was ich gesagt habe
Er ist in Österreich geboren, aber beging seine Verbrechen gegen die Menschheit als deutscher Staatsbürger
Inwiefern man das auf Österreich schieben kann, würde ich gerne erfahren
Neither was he in Germany
So what is he then
A Salzburgian
And what is Salzburg part of today
Austria
Therefore he is by modern borders an Austrian
Ok as long as it‘s your opinion I will let you be, because it‘s your opinion
(I very much disagree with it, but I don‘t like arguing with people so let‘s just leave it at that
Have a wonderful day/evening/night
Every German even today considers Austrians as Germans very often, when we in fact have a full on different culture, slightly different language and everything
Also this conversation was 2 days ago, I don‘t want to start this conversation about wether Austrians are German or not while many Germans call Mozart German while Hitler was 100% Austrian all over again
All I can say is that if you are in Austria and say any Austrian ist German you can be happy if you get out of here alive
Have a nice day and goodbye
Vienna pupil here
I don't know how I can describe it
The public transport and the infrastructure in Vienna is perfect
Also I think the city is very beautiful and has certain aspects not every big city has, for example the "old Danube" which is like an oasis in the middle of the city
I can't think of living anywhere else
Too nice here, couldn’t really imagine living anywhere else
It’s cool to have everything I need in reach as well as spots to go to if I need to relax
I also have some friends living close to me, who I can meet
The one thing most noticeable about living in a big city is probably the contact with different opinions, cultures and a lot of different people in general, which is something I really like
I actually see no downsides to living here and don’t understand the people who prefer living on the countryside for reasons other than medical ones (too much stress or noise in the city, maybe bad air quality or smth like that)
On the air quality note, my city actually has quite decent air quality for a city with a population >1m. That is thanks to a wind constantly blowing from the west to the east
Sometimes, however, that wind stops and that’s when it gets real bad
A few months ago there was no wind for days and I was close to needing a breathing mask because holy shit
Vienna expat/student here
The city is beautiful, full of history and amazing for the services it offers
Everything you need for the daily life is in walking or cycling distance, every area is packed with parks, I can walk at night through literally every corner of the city without a problem and the public transit is without exageration the best in the world
Even the motor traffic is a breeze compared to many other, even smaller places I know (although the Viennese would beg to differ)
All this while being decently affordable
Nevertheless, originally moving in here from Timișoara, Romania’s third biggest city, Vienna gives me more of an oversized village vibe rather than a big city one
It is awfully quiet at almost any time, the nightlife closes early and is mostly a let-down, and getting in in any social circle almost always requires some kind of pedigree from you
In my experience, locals while not being mean per se, are disproportionately proud and aren’t by anything in the world interested in intercultural communication, so you’d mostly end up hanging out with other foreigners who usually feel the same
E v e r y  shop is closed on Saturdays afternoon and all of Sundays and even the larger supermarkets have a reduced sortiment than what I’m used to in eastern european countries
It’s not rarely that I find myself travelling through all the city to find a trivial product I’m looking for
In all these regards, my hometown feels way more of a metropolis than Vienna at its almost 2 million inhabitants; and don’t even get me started on Bucharest
Vienna is certainly an amazing city
I just don’t vibe with it enough, so I’m gonna move somewhere else in the future
Also from Vienna
Nice inner city, but due to Corona I only go there to donate blood
Username checks out
There also negative sides
Its very hard to find a good place to live because the prices are ridicolous
The city administration also ignores major problems like over Immigration in certain areas or traffic noise
Vienna isnt a chill and romantic city anymore
Rent and public transport prices are wild in Germany
In Vienna, the year long public transport ticket costs 365€ a year
How do you even survive
In Vienna you can get a 70-80 m² appartment for that money
Yes but it's not like you can't afford a car anymore
Besides, using a car in a city like Vienna makes no sense whatsoever (except if you have to transport something large but there are good car sharing services for those instances)
Totally, I also really like London as a city
It just sucks that it's so expensive to live there and not even the higher salaries compensate for that
And time & space
A working fusion reactor
Even the rail network that seems to be favored in this thread would be much more feasible if energy was essentially abundant and free as well as CO2 neutral
Especially with the current climate change threats ahead, I'm not sure if it would be even worth investing billions upon billions in infrastructure that might very well connect a few desertified ghost towns in 2080
Maybe an atomic fusion reactor
Idk how they‘d do that with the Plasma, but I‘m sure it‘d be cool to have a CO2-neutral source of energy, a big one at that, and nothing will happen if something goes down (aka no country will be destroyed by nuclear explosions)
And idk I like the concept of not dying
Interesting to hear this from a swiss person, I feel like something like this would be an EU-project (like the free roaming that was introduced relatively recently)
Though, switzerland has good public transport and trains, so it also makes sense
But I agree, I have thought about this a lot and it was my immediate first thought upon reading the title
Actually Germany just pulled out of one with Austria as it was unable to build a much needed power line through Bavaria
Lacking this line, the whole net was instable and threatened to overload into Poland snd the Czech republic and might have caused a EU wide blackout
So at least for the foreseeable future wind power from the north and alpine energy storage damns cant work together efectivly
>Alternatively a high speed railway across all of Europe
It's in progress
Problem is while Austria and Italy did their part of digging one of the longest tunnels in the world over the last 20 years, Germany still hasn't even decided where they want to build their railway tracks that are supposed to connect us with Northern Europe
I've seen a video once that said building a dam between gibraltar and morocco to drain the mediterranean and/or build a gigantic hydro-power plant would need more concrete than all of humanity has ever used so far
This sounds like an even bigger project
Just privatize a bit more infrastructure, clearly there's some great business opportunity to be had there
The problem is that all the parties that focus on climate change are extremely opposed to nuclear reactors of any kind
Grüß Gott
Very many of the pretty old train stations are terminus stations which are pretty bad for high speed trains
Having to reverse too much costs a lot of time
Science can imagine a lot
With current mainstream materials it is not possible, with current experimental materials it already might be:
Definitely not fusion reactors, only fission ones
Well, there's a guy like that in the book too
;-)
What
They definietly are opposed to any form of nuclear energry
Fission has come a long way and is incredibly safe and Fusion is still entirely theoretical
> What
They definietly are opposed to any form of nuclear energry
Then they would be even against solar, which I don't see any indication of
I didn't find any strong opinions from any party in Austria regarding nuclear fusion, what are you basing your statement on
> Fission has come a long way and is incredibly safe and Fusion is still entirely theoretical
Nice opinion, yet I'm not talking about fission (which would be anyways unconstitutional in Austria for example), but fusion (which also is not "entirely theoretical" at all, just not practical)
I'll check tomorrow, I think there was one prepper guy that ended up being too suspicious and getting killed quickly because he wanted to defend his bunker
> I didn't find any strong opinions from any party in Austria regarding nuclear fusion, what are you basing your statement on
Read the party line from the green party
If you think they‘d differentiate between fission and fusion, you are wrong
They lead the huge missinformation campaign against nuclear energy in the 70ies
Ahhh, I mixed it up in my mind with a completely different book series
If you read the Expanse books, you'll see what I mean
Sorry for the confusion
A little bit different but there is an saying, when the buorocraty have failed you "your could send your complaints/objections to the salt magistrate" (Salzamt) which doesn't exist anymore
For a long time I thought that Balaton was just the Hungarian name for [lake Neusiedl]
I just now found out that Dora The Explorer teaches kids Spanish in the original (through this comment section xD) - it teaches English in Germany and Austria too
Not an entire show but an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants: There is a part in an episode where SpongeBob speaks German in the original version
In the German version he speaks Bavarian
There is an episode in Scrubs where they have a patient who only speaks German, and the blonde Doctor (I forgot her name sry) is the only one who knows the language
In the German version, it was all changed to Dutch instead
[According to this list] she teaches Spanish in the Irish- and the Serbian-language versions
Spanish for Irish makes sense, since most young Irish native speaker probably also know English pretty well
Don't know why in Serbia they decided to go with Spanish, but why not
In the Kannada-language version (language from India) she teaches Hindi
There's also a Maori-language version, Wikipedia doesn't say what she teaches there
I assume most Maori kids also know a certain amount of English already(?), so Spanish would make sense I guess
It also says nothing about the Malayam-language version (Dravidian language from southern India), I suppose it has to be either English or Hindi
All the other versions teach English to varying degree, some of them sprinkle in some occasional Spanish words
She does include some Spanish lingo at times though
They are ***GERMAN*** in the original
... thinking about it, it did kinda make sense, especially their names
I should rewatch Malcolm in English
This wasn't the first thing that came to my mind about this topic, but this is interesting
In the German version, everybody speaks standard German, but Mr Krabs has a very northern German way of talking
Probably because this is Germany's only access to the ocean and a lot of sailors have this way of talking
The old one or the Netflix one
Yeah it would be, but I never thought about it
I thought it was mainly about teaching little, _little_ kids pronounciation or something like that
(And I never thought about the fact that Dora The Explorer was existent in other countries, because I was a child and didn‘t think about what other countries do, so yeah ^ ^ “)
I still don't understand why they felt the need to make a German dub for what is basically a trilingual movie that is already ~30% in German, with some fantastic German-speaking actors at that (August Diehl just appears in one scene, but it's arguably the second best scene in the movie and he completely steals it)
It loses so much of its charme
Also, they just dubbed the English parts, but not the French ones
Oh man yeah, that was a thing
Thinking back, I remember how in Doremi they showed *very obviously japanese Onigiri* and called them cookies
Yeah, I mean why not
Spanish is a cool language
Yes
Dora la Exploradora teaches English to Castillian Spanish-speaking kids
I think Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Hindustani, and maybe Swahili are roughly on a similar level regarding usefulness
Entirely depends on your purpose
When you grow up in a non-english speaking country, american media all just blurrs together
As a kid you don't really think whether a character from a cartoon has this or that nationality
In german, Swiper was still called Swiper, and as a kid I obviously recognized that this wasn't a German name (neither was Boots or Map)
I knew that a lot of shows came from the US, but I didn't think much of it
Actually, and this is my personal impression, due to the fact that American media was everywhere, it felt more like a fairytale land than an actual place
Growing up also meant losing this perception fo the US, but even today I still sometimes hold on and think "There are actual people who were born and live in the US
I don't think most little kids in German speaking Europe would even grasp the concept of "latino". It's not like they explicitly mention it
She speaks German, teaches English, sometimes drops some words in Spanish, and most importantly, has a little monkey friend
Yeah
I think she's supposed to be "pan-Latino" without any specifications (Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican etc
In Austria, you can get a lengthy discussion about food and how to prepare it properly, with a concentration on two topics: Salads and dumplings
The two biggest are probably whether potato salad should or should not contain mayonnaise (and of course it shouldn't, anyone who thinks differently should have their taste buds and/or mental state examined) and whether potato dumplings or bread dumplings are superior (and again, the answer is obvious since bread dumplings are far better at soaking up sauces and don't taste like rubber)
And don't get me started on the cultural differences in food between Austria and Germany
Dear Germans: Putting any kind of sauce on a crackling, crunchy Wiener Schnitzel is an abomination and should (and maybe even will) get you kicked out of a restaurant in Vienna
Why the hell would anyone do something like that
Oh, and it's Erdapfel
Not Kartoffel, it's Topfen, not Quark and it's Schlagobers, not Sahne
Learn your own effin' language, dammit
(In other words, there are a few words that are used for the same object, depending on where in Austria or Germany you are, and of course, the other one is WRONG and they should start learning the proper word for it)
Whether the meat in the lunch bread is called "Fleischkas" or "Leberkas". That's a big thing here
I am a "Fleischkas" eater
The usage of the preamble "ur" draws a clearer line through Austria than any political party and could lead to civil war
What gendered article to use with "Nutella". Some people are wrong and say "das Nutella" (neutral) and some people are right and say "die Nutella" (feminine)
Then there are people who are just crazy and say "der Nutella" (masculine) but they are fortunately a tiny minority
A big divide in Austria but also in Germany is the way you give certain times of a day
Where I live it is like the slices of a pie
10:15 is Viertel elf (Quarter eleven) 10:30 is Half eleven, 10:45 is three quarters eleven
In other places it is quarter past ten, half eleven, quarter before/to eleven
In other areas there is even different forms like Quarter over ten (Viertel über zehn)
So going from region to region you can confuse people quite a bit if they are not used to interact in the multiple forms of time announcement
Another stark divide in Austria and Germany is the use of different decks of cards for the most popular card games and what those games are
The divide is between those who play with German suited cards (Hearts, bells, acorns, leaves) and those who play with traditional 'French' cards (️️ ️ clubs)
In Austria it is mainly Vienna+surrounding areas which plays French vs
everybody else
The time thing also overlaps with the card divide
I'd go with vinegar and oil
In Vienna another variant is very popular, so called 'Vogerl Salat' where field salad is added to the mix
here it’s the same, but with apple strudel
I actually had to think how I'm saying it
But in the end I agree with you
Now there's the question if you put butter and Nutella on your bread or just Nutella
Die / Das Cola
Der / Das Joghurt
Der / Das Pool
Der / Das Radio
Der Nutella
Der Butter
Das Joghurt
Fight me IRL
Look at him/her using "Erdapfel" for other potato products besides Erdapfelsalat (potato salad) and Erdapfelpüree (mashed potatoes)
I bet you also call Tomaten (tomatoes) "Paradeiser" :O
What also divides Austria in two: Is it called "Fleischkas" or "Leberkas"? In Western Austria we say "Fleischkas" in Eastern Austria it's called "Leberkas". But one thing gets us back together: We all love to eat it
I'm from Austria and a family friend told me about how he once was on vacation somewhere in the middle of Germany and he just wanted to buy a Sömmi (that's how we pronounce Semmel) for breakfast and had to discuss for 15 minutes with the store worker until he figured out that a Brötchen isn't a smaller version of Brot (bread) but, in fact, a Sömmi
We're happy to receive any Kina-saying refugees from the weird Ch Germans who obviously must be sick in some way
/r/SchnitzelVerbrechen/
NSFS (not safe for stomach)
Even on that it's an atrocity, what did that poor pig ever do to you to deserve that
I feel like Obelix when those Brits soaked his boar in peppermint sauce
If you use Erdapfel only for certain dishes but say Kartoffel otherwise you are too far gone
I'm afraid there is no helping you anymore
Paradeiser is correct and always will be, fight me
You're right ,for everything else it's Grundbirn
>And just because you went 'eh, it's somewhat the same shape and comes from the ground' doesn't mean Erdäpfel is a good word for Kartoffel

And yes, we know it's a misnomer because it contains neither Leber (liver) nor käs (cheese), but who cares, I don't wanna talk with it, I wanna eat it

You have been banned from /r/Austria
And people wonder why the Japanese think that we're the German speaking nation with culture
Yes, that too, whether the potato salad should be warm or cold is another thing that divides the country
And of course it should be cold
You need something to balance the onions and the oil
Try somewhere outside the tourist centers and you'll be sent packing if you order anything with "Sahne".
Also, you don't get a "Tüte" for your purchases
A Tüte is something you can smoke here (it's the slang word for a blunt)
If you want a bag for your purchases, ask for a Sackerl
In Tyrol we say "Fleischkas". Did you like it
Together with bread (Semmel) it's our standard lunch meal
It's called Semmi
That's a good explanation that I'll be using when my friends complain about it/me again
Thank you
You understand me
Bread, butter and jam are considered as normal
Bread, butter and honey are considered as normal
Why not bread, butter and Nutella
Dos Nutella
Right
It's so good
I could eat 3 of them if I wouldn't explode
SÖMMI KRUZIFIX
Am Austrian, it's both die and der Butter
Mostly I just say an butter, as in "reiss umma an butta du gschissana".
>I've yet to encounter anyone taking the choice of words serious enough outside of outrage articles
Nah its not serious at all
Say whatever you want
The only annoying people are some German tourists
Saying "Haha they say Sackerl instead of Tüte lol" in an Austrian grocery store is pretty rude
Upper Austria
District of Amstetten, so no but not too far off
If Bulgaria is small, what are we
Honestly, not that much I think
Lots of what big countries expect us not to have, we do
We have a strong east/west divide, you have a Bible Belt,...
How about that app of yours which helps you prevent sleeping with one of your relatives :D
Geographically the Netherlands might be small, but they have quite a large population, pretty famous cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam), and are well known in the world
>I have met far more Germans in Austria than I have actual Austrians
Were in austria was this
Holy shit did i ever fall for a hoax :D
The German name of the edible Dormouse is seven sleeper, which points to his long hibernation period
The German name of the Sloth is lazy animal
The German Name of a vole is pointy mouse
Romans and Gauls
I know it sounds fake but they are really literally called Edible Dormouse or Fat Dormouse because the Romans, Gauls and Etruscan hunted and ate them, usually as a snack due to their size
They are apparently still hunted and eaten in parts of Slovenia and Croatia today
Try it and report back :P
I guess they taste mucy like guinea pigs
I don't really know anything special about the occupation
What I collected as inofficial knowledge is that Austria was extremely lucky after WW2
they basically blamed it all on Nazi-Germany and convinced the allies that Austria was a victim in the war (which is absolutely not true) and that and neutrality is what got Austria its freedom
I think there's even a story about an Austrian and a Russian diplomat having a drinking competition and because the Austrian won, Austria soon got its freedom, but I don't know how much of it is true
My home region was  occupied by  France after the second world War
My great grandmother  told my mother that there were  Moroccon soldiers in their village
She told her, they were quite nice to the villagers and behaved friendly
I never got to know my great grandmather she died before I was born, so I knew that only from stories
Edit typos
It's not talked about much and I didn't learn a lot about it in school
We pretty much breezed through it in an hour learning that there was an occupation, which allied country controlled what areas and how difficult it was for them to share Vienna
More focused on the rebuilding efforts, the Trümmerfrauen and how big of a deal rebuilding the Stephansdom was, for some reason my teacher found it really important to focus on that
My grandma (who was just a young kid) told me the soviet soldiers liked to give out chocolate to kids and the americans always gave cigarettes to the adults, that's pretty much all I remember
One thing I recently learned (late night wikipedia reading) is that the americans built huge TV antennas in vienna so that soviet controlled areas around Vienna could get western news
These antennas were in use until 2008 or so
Pretty impressive
Another thing is that the CIA helped form and financed the far right party now called FPÖ. At the time mostly made up of fairly high ranking NSDAP and wehrmacht officials and soldiers
All for fighting communism, eh
One thing that nowadays sometimes comes up is allied memorials
The allied powers made us keep their memorials intact forever after leaving, and we aren't allowed to remove them
A problematic one is a [Stalin plaque] on a house he lived in for a while, built by the soviet occupiers
There is some discussion about if we're allowed to remove it because technically it might not be not a war memorial, but it was built by the red army
Even Chruschtschow asked Austria to remove it after they went through De-stalinization but so far we've at least put a plaque under it to think of the victims of Stalins politics
My hometown (linz) was occupied by the allies south of the danube and north was soviet
In school we just learned that familys had to go trough checkpoints to visit familys in the other side
Thats everything i know about the occupation
The village I grew up in was initially part of the Soviet zone, and the closest town was in the British zone, so everyone going to town had to cross the zone border, which, as my grandmother told me, was quite difficult sometimes
The Soviet soldiers occupied the school in the village so there was no school for a while, but then again school hadn‘t regularly been in session for a bit I guess
The entire province eventually became part of the British zone and for the most part people were relieved that it was British and not Soviet anymore
In the village, many people didn‘t really „feel“ occupied, mostly because it was so secluded and small
I can‘t really say if there is a lasting influence on my province now, except maybe a strange fixation on British English
Oh, and some children fathered by occupying soldiers
My grandmother used to tell us about the girls in the village that got involved with the soldiers - village gossip at its best
The occupation isn‘t really taught in school in too much detail, the books mostly focus on the Staatsvertrag in 1955, but it is definitely something that has been preserved in the collective memory of the village
My grandfather worked in a soviet factory after WWII during the occupation and lived in the soviet sector
Although he was no Nazi sympathizer (he was too young to "participate" in the war and lost his father and brother plus was displaced from his hometown in Serbia, so he just hated the entire war) he disliked the soviets even more
He told me once that they were very happy when the soldiers left
In general, the soviet occupation forces have a very bad reputation
Unfortunately he barely talked about his experiences, I guess way too much trauma
It‘s quite interesting actually
Today you can still see the aftermath of the occupation when you compare the economic power of our western half to our eastern half
GDP per capita is higher in the former regions of the Allied occupation and lower in the former Soviet occupation zones in eastern Austria
Especially in Burgenland, which is the south eastern state of Austria and also the „poorest“ state in all of Austria
One huge reason for this was of course the Marshall Plan the western states of Austria received
Today growing up I learned _so much_ about WWl, WWll, Austria pre-war, Austria during 1918-1938 and Austria post-war
I can‘t imagine anybody not learning as much as I did
(WWll is in most schools a really big subject in 8th grade
For me it took the time of half the school year
) My teacher told me too that everybody should know as much as possible about it, so that something like this never happens again
Sadly my class couldn‘t go to a Concentration Camp like about every other school does because
Now back to topic lol - Division in Austria - I know that my part was inhabited by the brits
There are probably many cities where you can see that, sadly I live on the countryside tho
And sometimes adults are pissed off about the South Tyrols, but I think teens and young adults just joke about it and say _Those dang italians
_ (Just jokes we love our italian neighbors <3)
My grandma use to talk about them as kids hiding from the Soviets in the woods after the war because they would drive around the countryside/villages and while „inspecting“ houses rape girls if they were in the mood
Don‘t know about the other allies‘ sectors though
When I went to school most adults were still pissed about south Tyrol (now part of Italy), albeit I'm pretty sure it was mostly a joke
Also tbh the military is just ridiculous
18+ men are required to join for a year or something, but we couldn't legally go to war anyways, our country is tiny and they mostly provide flood relief (which is great but
come on, Wehrpflicht in case of Hochwasser
Pretty dumb)
Very weird thread
Just Austrian (and one German) top comments and two very weird Hungarian ones
The myth is about Figl
I heard he won a drinking competition with the soviet representative
Looks like it's all BS
It's almost ridiculous how we got away with claiming to get occupied
People helt parades in the street when Hitler's car drove through their town on his way to Vienna
> I think there's even a story about an Austrian and a Russian diplomat having a drinking competition and because the Austrian won, Austria soon got its freedom, but I don't know how much of it is true
Figl and Renner drinking Molotov under the table might have happened, like in their free time or whatever, but it hadn't to do anything with the state treaty and the end of the occupation
It is most certainly a myth
Your Jonathan Frakes
Wir haben zwar nicht versucht, die Annexion zu bekämpfen, besonders erfolgreich wäre eine militärische Auseinandersetzung mit Deutschland sowieso nicht gewesen
Trotzdem wird uns vorgeworfen, uns nicht vergeblich geopfert zu haben
Dass es österreichische Nazigrößen gegeben hat, ist nicht die Schuld des ganzen Landes
Die Heim-ins-Reich-Motivation ist älter als der Nationalsozialismus
My grandmother told the same story, except the French soldiers didn't behave quite as nicely in hers
My grandmother was about 12 when the war ended
One of their neighbors was shot dead when his window shutter jammed and opened with a loud noise, startling one of the soldiers
There were also a fair amount of rapes, something my grandmother became aware of because her father had her do inside chores whenever he could and occasionally ordered her to hide under her brother's bed and keep quiet because sometimes soldiers came (or maybe the same one each time, I'm unsure about that) and asked specifically for her
THE CIA CREATED THE FPÖ? WHHHAAAT THE FUCK
> My grandma (who was just a young kid) told me the soviet soldiers liked to give out chocolate to kids and the americans always gave cigarettes to the adults, that's pretty much all I remember
My grandma's story was that they were hungry and asked American soldiers for food but they only gave them chewing gum
> by the allies south of the danube and north was soviet
The term "allies" in this context always includes the Soviets
The south was US occupied
And the wall didn't help either
Well, while we did indeed make up quite the percentage of nazis in Nazi Germany, it was Nazi Germany and not Nazi Austria throwing the world into chaos
That’s probably the reason why
Wrong war
To answer your question: the land was divided up along ethnic lines in 1919 (Treaty of St
Germain) and the inhabitants were given the choice in local referenda in 1921
The majority opted to go with Austria, because it was mostly inhabited by German and Croatian speakers, and they wanted to be in the same country as their closest biggest cities, especially Fürstenfeld, Graz and Vienna
Sopron/Ödenburg was planned to be the capital of that region, but opted to stay with Hungary
well we technically got occupied apparently, there should have been a democratic voting, about a connection of austria and germany, but hitler couldnt wait so long, so he drove the day before the voting happened to vienna and claimed it german territory
We got away with it because the allies *decided so*. The idea that Austria would be framed as a victim was drawn up by the allies in 1943 - so that they could build a neutral block in the center of Europe, next to Switzerland
It wasn't that they just believed us, for politics of the allies it was just way easier to "believe" that
It was just easier for everyone
Yes, the "we were the poor first innocent victims of the bad, bad Nazis" idea was common until the late 90s, since then we've pretty much stopped that and stand by what happened
I think it's because everyone knew someone who was in the war or with the Nazis at the time
And I understand it must be difficult to think that your own grandfather could have been one of them
It's easier to just tell yourself he did it because he had no choice
I'm sure there were a lot of people who really didn't have a choice but to play along but on the other hand, looking at [pictures of the crowds] on the Heldenplatz for Hitlers first speech tells a story on its own
[Yep] they helped create it with the assistance of a former Hitlerjugend leader and high ranking SS officer Sturmbannführer Karl Kowarik, who the americans just pardoned because he was useful to them
Mich wundert es irgendwie nicht
Well sch is pretty much one letter
Similar to ш. No idea where the rest comes from though
Our spelling is pronounced like крушчов.
So it doesn't look like the already exisiting words Stadt or Statt or statt
Staat is also pronounced with a very long aaaaa so the double a is warranted
German has plenty of words with double a.
e.g. Aal (eel), Aas (carrion) or Paar (pair)
Yes, it‘s a combination of many different factors
Our military is a joke though, even with the draft
Id argue that a professional military would be more cost efficient
We *could* be invaded just like that, that is the whole issue
Our military is a joke
Underfinanced, undertrained, underequipped and more than anything undermotivated
Yeah, Austria joined Germany because of an Ultimatum from Hitler to Schuschnigg, who ordered the military to not resist the Wehrmacht
But yeah, many people were not unhappy about
I mean also who would object, the left was already suppressed and stayed quiet, the Nazi party was the only legal opposition of the autocratic ruling rightwing Christdemocrats and growing steadily in support since the economic crises
Edit: that sounded almost apologistic, I only wanted to say that the Anschluss hasn't happened in a vacuum
Agreed, it's awful and tragic and just horrific how the war, both of them, really, scarred entire generations for life
Die CIA sind die größten Verbrecher der welt
Yeah I know the CIA has/had their fingers in many many places around the world I was just surprised that they did it in Austria too
Shouldn't have been surprised though
No the map says its american
Look at a map where the city of linz is
Yeah we were guilty, but you can’t seriously blame Austria for Hitler being an Austrian
He became Germany’s dictator, not Austria‘s.
Edit: Well technically speaking he did became Austria‘s dictator too*
While I do agree with that, he still was a failed artist while in Austria and in Germany he was a politician
Granted, anybody could fall for his trap, Austrians just like Germans, but Germans fell for it first
Thanks ÖVP for spreading lies and propaganda when we voted on it in 2013
>the Nazi party was the only legal opposition
No, in fact they were made illegal after they killed the former austrian autocratic ruler Dolfuß in 1934 in a failed putsch
After that a lot of austrian nazis fled to Germany, giving lots of "intelligence" (information) to the german nazi party
Others stayed in Austria ready to take orders
When they anschlussed Austria, they already had lists ready with who to imprison first - basically everybody in any leadership position of any political movement was imprisoned before Hitler made his triumphal drive through Austira
Operation Gladio also had a chapter in Austria, you can look it up online
Konsistenz =~/~= consistency, at least not in most cases (excluding geology)
It's like, a half false friend
Konsistenz usually refers to texture or stiffness
E.g. "Die Konsistenz meines Stuhls war heute sehr weich, ich muss wohl mehr Ballaststoffe essen
Consistency in this context is best translated as Konsequenz, Kontinuität, Konstanz or Beständigkeit
Well I usually just respond with: You elected him, we didn't even allow him to study art
Obviously this is not a sincere statement and just joking comeback to those remarks
Austria had its own fascist government at the time
But eventhough the NADSP was illegal in austria, it had a huge base
So that's why nothing was done to stop the invasion of austria
Basically at the time austrians considered themselves german as well
German being ethnicity
So they said they didn't want to have germans shoot germans
But in reality they thought maybe austria will a get a good status in the 3rd reich, as austrians are the better germans
Yea kinda fucked up
So after WW2, austria changed the narrative
Austrians were austrian and not german
The language difference was made more noticable (not the dialects, they already were)
They were declared illegal before the attempted coup, if I remember it right in 1933 when there was an terror act traced back to them, but rhey were made legal again before the Anschluss, at least through the Berchtesgadener Abkommen when Schuschnigg and Hitler met in person, but yeah that was pretty close to the Anschluss
I thought they were made legal before that but it seems I remember it wrong
Edit:
I thought on the [Juli-Abkommen] which forced Schuschnigg to grand the NSDAP members giving amnesty, but it didn't make them legal again
Yeah sorry for not being clear
I meant the southern bank of the Danube in Upper Austria
The NSDAP was illegal for a while, but Hitler pressured Schuschnigg to make it legal again for a promise to ease the political pressure Germany but on Austria (which he of course didn't do)
After we lost the support of Mussolini Hitler had an easy game with Austria
Ok I will think of that next time we‘re supposed to look into the future :3 (I always sound passive aggressive when I use sarcasm, don‘t mind that, I love you <3)
Another interesting facet that I find is hardly ever talked about is that in the phase before the Anschluss Schuschnigg contacted country after country in the attempt to find support for an independent Austria, but nobody was willing to help
Mexico was the only country in the world that was willing to - verbaly - protest the Anschluss, military support was impossible for them however
>  Austrians are trying to blame it all on them though
That is a straight up lie
Up until the 90s yes, nowadays absolutely not
No they're saying that it's BS to say "he was born in austria so it's entirely austrias fault".
Well but he wasn’t? It‘s not even a lie to say that
Up until Anschluss the Austro-Fascist government tried to stop an German annexation of Austria
He did became chancellor after Anschluss, but the Austrian state did de facto not exist anymore
I've repeatedly heard and read that
Sure, we're far from innocent
And unlike in the 50s-80s, nobody says so anymore
But the constant memes about "actually austria started both world wars because hitler was born in austria" are still incredibly annoying
Cordula Grün in Austria
Played all the time and while it's not really a bad song it got annoying
[Hulapalu]
I do not take any responsibility for possible brain or ear damage
Austria - Vo Mello Bis Ge Schoppornou by Hollstuonarmusigbigbandclub
Also funny because it was sung by people from Vorarlberg, the wester most region of Austria and it was sung in such a deep dialect that if you weren’t from Vorarlberg yourself you had a hard time understanding a thing
But the melody alone was very catchy so it became a hit in all of Austria
[Atemlos by Helene Fischer] and [Cordula Grün by die Draufgänger] are both German, but overplayed here imho
Same with [Holz - 257ers] (/were all pretty overplayed)
A truly Austrian song that was really overplayed imo was [Eine ins Leben by Pizzeria und Jaus] But it‘s quite a good song so I‘m not complaining
same in slovakia
this was a huge hit
Fun fact: Aserejé is actually a dadaist/phonetic "cover" of the the first line of Sugar Hill Gang's [Rapper's Delight]

It's basically the way I sang English pop songs when I was 4 years old
I'm serious, look it up (if you know Spanish you might be aware of that, but it was a huge surprise for me)
I like "Atemlos". I think most people just hate it ironically, because it has been so overplayed
It's a good song though
Alors on Danse
He is such a disgusting creep, I can't even
I‘ve never actually heard Hulapalu on radio, only during festivals
And I hate that thing along with the human that created it with a passion I usually don‘t have
Oh my, mid 2000s German TV Humour
Needs a bit of Stefan Raab with his weird laugh sprinkled on top
Or, you know, because of dementia
Wow, did you guys really have to expose Helene Fischers most passionate fans like that
didn't know that
always thought he was french
sorry
I tend to apologize to even small mistakes nobody cares about due to the fact I'm a rather insecure person who doesn't want to bother anyone
Just want for everyone to have a good time
TLDR; In Austria we have a nuclear power plant
After it was build, the gov asked the people if they want it
People said no
It was never turned on
Wiki: [
Krankenhaus Nord in Vienna
Construction was started in 2010 and the scheduled Opening was 2015, it opened in 2019
The thing that most people remember though is the "Energy Protection Ring".
The city of Vienna paid 95
000(!) Euros for someone to establish a ring of protection around the hospital to protect it from "Bad Energy". Yep high government officials regularly pay for esoteric things with public money
It also costed like 225 Million too much
even better: 50
47% voted against it
&#x200B;
Nowadays it's open to visitors and there is an electronic music festival held annually on the premises of the power plant
[Shutdown Festival]
Today it's used as a quite successful festival venue, so not a completely failed project
I'd mention Kickl's horses though
Germany no upgrading its rail network to account for upgrades in neighboring countries seems like a common theme
We have the same problem with the Brenner Basistunnel
with 5 million people that's around 15 EUR per card, that's not that bad
The real fail I guess is predicting 28 cents per card, shipping is more
> Today it's used as a quite successful festival venue, so not a completely failed project
a roughly 1
6 billion EUR festival venue
Nope
And how fucking ridiculous is stocking up on toilet paper
Like ... do people expect like 2 years of quarantine or what
Having one extra pack, alright, having fucking 10 extra packs ... what the fuck
Well, i needed a dust mask for some home improvement and they are all gone
Yeah, you can barely find any hand sanitizer and no face masks at all, and noodles and flour are almost out in the local store where I live
They still had baby wipes
Those are perishables, so probably those are rebated and it's cheaper than wholesale, and some shop owner went at it
It depends heavily on the family size though
A big family, maybe even with several women, and you use quite a lot of toilet paper in a week
I would say yes definitely
seen many panic buying over the last few weeks
Just flush, dip and wash
They aren't stockpiling, they just started using soap
pro tip: dont shit into fans and you wont have that problem, and can leave some TP for other people
Well, that might be a good a time as any to talk about resource use in the context of taking a shit/piss then
Yeah ... that's the next thing, people stockpiling on mineral water or such
Just why
It's not like even a quarantine means they will shut off your water or electricity or internet
You are just not allowed to go outside
The latter, because that's how throughput works
We do
We're quite happy with it
And you expect anyone noticing that those are three separate links
Women need toilet paper for more than that :)
Really
Shop workers hate it
As a former sales woman I would never ever want to work on Sunday
Not every week then, if you're talking about periods
If you're talking about origami, there's better paper than that
Does not change the fact that basic infrastructure is not gonna break down from something like this
And you think people have nothing else to do
not only period
Some women have a problem with discharge, especially pregnant ones
Oh really
That's interesting
Shop worker is not typically a student job here
Definitely not cashier and the like
Maybe stocking, though not really that either as far as I can tell
I wonder if that directly relates
Like, Sundays have always been closed here in Austria and that's why it never became attractive for students, or if there's a different reason
It is more about having one day they can spend with their family
I can't imagine having a small child but not one full day I can spend with it
Well, there are professionals to deal with the big discharge at the end of a pregnancy called midwifes, but I can see how that'll take a few rolls, yes
Austrian women are pregnant for about a single year in their entire life on average, so I'm not sure that multiple pregnancies at home is a realistic scenario to prepare for
In any case, revisiting and reviewing habits one might have "learned" as a toddler might be in order if you are figuratively burning through toilet paper (in the literal case get a smoke alarm in addition to having a talk)
Having better things to do has nothing to do with being important
Fernweh, is my favourite German one
It is the exact opposite to home sick, the yearning to leave your known surroundings behind in search for the unknown
To me as a German speaking native it is not the same as wanderlust, even though pages try to translate it that way
Wanderlust literally is the to experience the joy of hiking, so I don't feel like the two are describing the same concept
For me in German that would be Heil (or at least it was until the nazis ruined it
Heil describes a state of absolute completeness, health, happiness, well-being and redemption/salvation
The German words for healing, holy and the homonymous adjective (which means safe, unhurt or "in one piece" for objects) are derived from it
It is also still used as a salute among hunters and fishermen (Weidmanns Heil/Petri Heil) or when reaching the peak of a mountain
In Vorarlberg (and I guess in Swiss German as well) people don't use the verb "arbeiten" (to work) but "schaffen" (to create), which I think is pretty dope
Morgenstern
Because has a double meaning
For once the brightest star that‘s seen right before dawn, and also the weapon, Morning Star
I love all of those words ngl
I wouldn‘t even have thought of them
Oh that actually makes sense, thanks for that
It's really interesting how loan words and words in general can change meaning over time
Adolf, just doesn't sound right
Recently somebody told me that they're naming their son Cornelius
It was really really hard to smile and saying that it's a great name
we have more than Adolf
Franz, Erich, Johann, Walter, Karl
I can go on
when my mom said she wants to name my younger brother Julius I was like "Who in the world would give their kid such an old name
", but now I like it much better than Julian
Out of all those, Tankwart still stands out as the worst name ever
Bitte wer wäre das
that is somehow absolutely true
maybe I don't get the question but OP asks for native names, not names from another language converted to your native language, or am I dumb
The Austrian government has that too
I didn't even know that we had a list until I talked to a friend of mine that worked for the government
She also told me that there's a lot of obscure names on it and you even can apply for others, it's just more of a hassle
Technically, not a list
You just have to credibly prove that the chosen name is, well, a name
Source: named a child a couple of years ago
Quite funny for Austria but Josef Ressel invented the world's first working screw propellor for a ship, eliminating the need for sails
Washing your hands after each patient in the hospital, probably
Or Red Bull
One of these
Siegfried Marcus was considered the inventor of the combustion engine
He lived in Vienna during the invention
Due to his Jewish ancestry the Nazis decided that Benz was the inventor
>after inventing whiskey, we took a break for 300 years before inventing anything else
Hardly a surprise :)
uuhm i might be wrong here but I thought the guy who first distinguished the blood groups was an austrian biologist called karl landsteiner
I just realized that Ressel wasn't born in Austria
Frappe is good
According to one of the other posters Ressel wasn't actually born in austria
But afaik the ACTUAL paper clip, the one that is used today (the so called Gem paper clip), was not actually invented by a norwegian [link to wikipedia]
But i do appreciate my cheese slicer
so thank you
And the Rubik cube
Birth control pill and nuclear splitting
For an invention from the "current austrian territory", I think I'd choose the Kaplan-Turbine, which is frequently used in hydropower plants
If you go by that Mozart is actually German
Well, u/Spooodermon did point out "for a ship", so
There was a pretty big push in the 1990s to highlight norwegian achievements
One of the things that the norwegian government highlighted was the invention of the paper clip
They erected a paper clip [monument] and even went as far as issuing a special [stamp] in 1999 (which looks pretty cool)
However both of those dont actually depict [the version of the paper clip that was indeed invented by a norwegian] ended up not gaining traction, because it’s design misses the last bend, making the use of it less practical)
Sauce: late night [wikipedia] scrolling
Interesanterweise sagt die englische Variante der Seite was anderes:
>Current Austrian thinking is that Marcus' first car ran in the late 1880s.[\[3\]] However, early publications suggest that he may have had a petrol powered vehicle running earlier than 1870
[\[4\]]  The deliberate destruction of evidence of Marcus' inventions by the  Nazi regime has left these dates open to debate and speculation
[\[5\]] [Britannica] cites 1864 for Marcus' first car with a 10-year gap to the second, which is consistent with other sources
[\[6\]]
ah ok thanks :))
So robot=slave
Well, not quite
The whole question of „what did your country invent“ is a bit tricky since, as you have correctly pointed out, national boundaries have chamged so much over the years
I get your point, but the difference between Mozart and Ressel is that Mozart was born in what is NOW austria, and Ressel was born in what is NOW the Czech Republic
Based on that, children in the Czech Republic probably learn that he was born in Czech Republic (and therefore consider him a Czech) and kids in Austria learn that Mozart was born in Austria (and therefore consider him Austrian)
No he isn't. He was born in Salzburg, which wasn't part of Germany
That's just something Germans claim
You mean born in Salzburg
Which was not Germany or Austria but its own bishopric in its time
I mean he lived nearly his whole live in Vienna so pretty much an Austrian
Also american
What he's probably referring to is the [Holy Roman Empire of German Nations] which (the Prince-Archbishopric of) Salzburg used to be part of
Still, that the HRE is not the same as Germany
The EU knows the problem and is working on it
But there are many technical differences which would be very expensive to eliminate
Power systems, track gauges, signals, platform heights, etc
There will probably never be a single railway system in Europe
You can only standardize regulations and build multi-system locomotives for certain routes
We already have had so much standardization in the education system
Yeah, university degrees should be comparable - but please dont force all schools in the EU to operate the same way
One of the best things in Austria is that schools have the Autonomy to try out various systems of education
Fuck no
>Are there different track gauges though
I'm only aware of Russia having a different one than everyone else
Spain:
But newer high-speed lines have already been built in standard gauge
Ask your local highway fire department, they likely already have one or two
Isn't it similar to Blockleiter / Blockwart
It's still used as an insult today
I have heard it plenty, especially lately
Even says so on the English and German Wiki
"Blockwart" is literally calling someone a Nazi snoop
I never had the impressions that it's a light insult you'd just throw around
"Blockwart-Mentalität" isn't as bad though
and Kevin
Most germans are begging me to speak propper german, i mean ... why should i speak propper german if i allready speak a superiour version of german
To be real, there are a lot of germans (who don't speak dutch) who understand my dutch better then my dialekt and i find that hilarious
> shit where there's some audio guide I often find the English recording speaks really slowly
That's definitely not an English-only problem
I think that is a general Audio-guide thing
The first two Anno Games and Ori
Not much more I guess
There were some very controversial and very swiftly indexxed [Neonazi games] in the early 90s that came from Austria and Germany
That was among the indicators how soon and how well Neonazis across the world have adopted Computers and the Internet for their organising
Fifa, Assassin's Creed, Battlefield, Candy Crush
But we have both Ubisoft and EA creating games in Romania and there are many more
Some together with other countries (like Sweden), some alone
I backed Kingdom Come Deliverance eagerly since day one
Was a bit disappointed that the main dev is such an alt-right adjacent cunt though
Anno was originally developed by the Austrian company Max Design
Fun fact, the Frontline Gamemod3 for World of Tanks was/is developed by a company in Austria
I visited a university lecture by the CEO of that company
Very impressive and interesting
You forget that [JoWood] was an Austrian publisher
They published well knwon games like Gothic, Spellforce and Inustry Giant
Don't forget slot machines :/
There was Ski Challenge
But I don't think it still works
Probably only well known in Germany and Switzerland back in the days
You smell werse than a dozen ro''en eggs drenched in a burrel of vinegur
It was a cult game back then but nowadays nobody seems to remember
Sometime in spring, I believe March or April, the Icelandic(?) President recorded a message for all Eve Online Players
I believe you can find it on YouTube
The first two Anno games were Austrian actually
Idk which exactly
But we (romanians) worked on the franchise
Sadly Vavda shows a pattern of alligning with [alt-right] [talking points] and [people]
Nero was the old twitter handle of pedophile alt-right firebrand Milo Yinnopolis and the chap in the first pic is alt right darling James Damore
He also really likes Paul Joseph Watson of Breitbart fame
As someone working professionally in history it is a record scratcher when somene makes a "realistic" (which is nearly impossible) game about history, makes sweepung statements about history especially in regards to talking points about whiteness and women in opposition to the opinion academics that are immersed on the subject (who then get nunerous death threats from gamer gaters) and then turns out to like people who are "race-realists", talk about the "jewish question and are in favour of stopping "white replacement" (which basically means holocausting everyone who is not "white")
He is the main dev, his vision and beliefs influence the game
Especially when we talk about something like a reconstruction of and narrative about historical events
And when the visionary behind the peoject has ties to the newest iteration of white nationalism it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth whenever you play
You may declare the artist dead, but even the death of the artist does not wash away the vision invested into the artwork  during its creation
How much closer can you be if you twitter like and repost alt right guys like Milo, Paul Joseph Watson and are an avid GamerGater
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is most likely a duck
Well, still better than Nazi train simulator
Well, for some people you move their destination is literally the final station
Horse meat is pretty good though
Yeah
That's a problem then
Reminds me of Lidl selling horse meat lasagna
Did they know it was horse meat
I thought the deception was on the side of the slaughter houses or the meat distributors, not the retail sellers
If you enjoyed Dark, then you may also like the hacker-thriller "Who Am I". It's by the same directors
I really enjoyed it too, it is also very popular among my friends
I think Germany has some good actors, but most of the series/movies have a boring plot (detective in a rural town style, there are 1000s of these)
Like everybody knows it is some subpar shit, but people just accepted it
I'm very happy that with Dark and Babylon Berlin the niveau is finally getting better
Lupin (fr) is also really good
I'm about halfway into the ahow and I love it
If you like heist shows/liked the feeling of Sherlock, definitely check it out
Thanks Czechia for making such good beer
Thank you Hungary for the paprika and the music, and Croatia for the amazing vacations even though I was almost sent to jail there once
**Italy:** thank you for the food
and the nice beaches and beautiful cities
**Liechtenstein:** I don't don't know what to thank for, but you're cool
**Switzerland:** Our red and white alpine bros
Thank you for the chocolate, the cheese, and for making our dialects look like a piece of cake
**Czechia:** thanks for the beer and the food and the millions of people who came here until 100 years ago and are now Austrians

Also, thanks for having a cheap Airport in close proximity (BTS)
**Hungary:** Thanks for the food and the wine, and the nice people
And the SPAs
**Slovenia:** thanks for having roads, for when we go on our holiday in Croatia
And thanks for your beautiful country and wonderful people
Sorry for how Carnithia has treated the Slovenian minority
**Germany:** Thanks for (unwillingly) always taking the place in the spotlight whenever something fucked-up happens here
Thanks to you you guys we look like the Shiba Inu puppy of nations, when really we always have been more like a really bitter, bitchy, and psychotic old house-cat
We start a world war
You get the blame
A guy from here starts another one
He did it as German chancellor
We get an ultra right wing government
Your extreme right murders people
People from both our countries commit a huge genocide
You pay all the reparations
Thanks for all the trade
Thanks for all the trash-TV that makes us feel better about ourselves
Thanks for coming after us in the alphabet (at least in English), so when the both of us get 0 points in the ESC, we can still say "at least we beat the Germans".
Thanks for losing that one football game that one time in 1978
It really means a lot to a lot of people
Still
You are a weird ass and neurotic people, but at the end of the day you are a really great country
Even though your people do so many tiny things that I absolutely can't stand (mainly linguistically, but also some habits), I can't help it but love all of you
Maybe I feel like I have to, maybe it's just fate
Kinda like a sibling
Thanks for that
And **THANK YOU** for giving us Dirk Stermann
[He's] a [national treasure]
Thanks to Switzerland for Rösti and being my partner‘s homeland
Thanks to Germany for being our bros
Thanks to Liechtenstein for being just the way you are
Thanks to Italy for delicious cuisine and not usually reciting the part of your anthem that bitches about Austria
Thanks to Czechia for delicious beer and having a great captial city to visit
Thanks to Slovakia for having your captial city being so close to Vienna and being so easy to visit and hang out in
Thanks to Hungary for more great food and also an awesome captial city and awesome language
Thanks to Slovenia for the pretty Lippizaner horses and for letting us keep the name Käsekrainer (my favorite late-night Würstelstand snack)
Thank you Germany for taking the blame on WW2 and letting us tell ppl that Beethoven is Austrian
Thanks Germany for taking the main blame for Hitler
But Ljubljana has an Ikea doesn't it
TIL Switzerland is the EU
Hitler never considered himself Austrian and hated Austria and the Habsburg
He didn't even serve Austria in WW1
Doesn't sadly excuse those who collaborated with him
thanks czech republic for the beautiful cities and castles
krumlov is almost my second home
love the Böhmerwald region
No but I only can speak for your gas stations, really
(And supermarkets which are quite lovely)
I imagine their blueprints looking like their instructions
Ah okay
If you like details so much, you shouldn't forget that Hitler lost his austrian citizenship in 1914 when he went to WWI for Germany
So, Hitler wasn't Austrian for 24 years before WW2 started
Isn’t it 20 for 10 days
To be fair if they charged less many people would just use it as a free Autobahn (and the roads are better than most German roads)
Almdudler is already mentioned
[Latella] is a whey drink with various fruit juices
In Romania it’s Frutti Fresh
It’s this highly artificial, yet tasty soda brand, that basically has all the flavours that Fanta doesn’t over here: Grapefruit, Pear, Peach, Grape and of course Tutti Frutti
Almdudler is a sweet carbonated soft drink made from herbal extracts
IIRC second most popular drink after Coca-Cola
There is also Murelli, which comes in many different varieties, which is sadly not as popular as it deserves to be
I particularly love orange & passion fruit and rhubarb & mint
Not from Austria, but [Frucade] is generally considered to be a cult drink in Austria and southern Germany (produced in Bavaria)
Other than that maybe [Almdudler]
Just searched through the comments
Yeah, the Germans and Austrians said about everything we have around here except one I haven‘t seen: [Mezzo Mix] It‘s known as Spezi, except that Spezi is more of a name that is used for all brands (e.g. Cola) whereas Mezzo Mix is more of a specific brand (e.g. for Cola - Coca Cola or Pepsi
Not sure if Himbeerkracherl (raspberry soda) is a common thing outside Austria
[Club Mate] was really popular with IT nerds, I'm not sure how popular its today
Luckily we find Cockta in the supermarket in Austria too
I prefer it over any other cola for sure
A Kebab, spicy with everything and Ayran is probably the phrase I said most often in my life
Also Traubisoda or Schartner Bombe
But those are smaller
Rauch Eistee
Eistee ist probably available somewhere else, but that Rauch quality
Also Makava
Don't forget Frucade
It's a German brand, but the formula they use in Austria is very different (fruiter and sweeter), and 100x better than German Frucade
Is Murrelli even available Austrian wide
Which exists all over the world
Interesting
Almdudler is Austria's national soft drink
But I'd try apple-Almdudler
If I ever get to Namibia, that's definitely on my list
Almdudler already made it that far north
I'm surprised
It's a thing in Austria too
We have it in Austria too
Oh yeah, I totally not thought of Schartner Bombe even it was a favourite of mine as child
Also "Rotes Kracherl" but that's simplt Raspberry lemonade
Yeah, I don't know what they do different, but no other bottled iced tea compares, most don't even come close
They even managed to make the sugar free version taste good
Personally I can only assume they have a contract signed in blood lying around somewhere
I think Merkur has it Austria wide now
At least I have been able to get it in Carinthia and Vienna
And they have an online shop where you can order a case with 12 bottles of whatever you want
When I was a kid my dad always brought a case or two when he was in Murau
I guess the appeal was that it was the most caffeinated drink before Energy drinks were available
Also a looooot of Turkish bakeries and speciality shops
The Turkish diaspora is a mighty fine culinary ambassador
I‘m from Styria, but I haven‘t ever seen or heard of Murrelli
Maybe I‘m in the wrong part or I just don‘t go to Merkur often enough /: (My Merkur in my region closed and now I gotta drive to the next big city to go to Merkur)
You can't buy apple juice and carbonated water in the netherlands
Malzbier is often non alcoholic and I've seen it rarely outside of German speaking countries
But I guess it's not even thaaat popular here
That's cool to hear
I have been to Germany only a couple of times in my life, and I hadn't seen it
Nor expected to see it honestly
Do you have any Italian shops near you
They would probably have it
Unless they are as Italian as "Italian restaurants" in the US
>not in one bottle
I have never seen that either, still that drink is a staple here
It's not rocket science: Grab a glass, fill it half with apple juice and half with mineral water (containing CO2)
Voila, you have Apfelsaft gespritzt, or how they call it in Germany "Apfelschorle"
I've honestly never seen that
Schlampen lasagne
Maybe I just don't watch channels that are big enough to have subtitle translators (because this "feature" seems to be tied to that)
It’s not at all a taboo to talk about it
Yes, there are some people that don’t like it, but it’s not really something you would not talk about
Talking about the Nazi regime is not taboo at all
Glorifying it is very taboo, and in certain cases also illegal
Talking about the Austro-Fascist dictatorship under Dollfuß and Schuschnigg that preceded the Nazi-regime, is definitely more touchy
There's not really any casual discussion you could have about the third Reich
Everyone is on the same page, really
Nice username btw
But tbf we get taught a lot about it in school (at least I did) so it may be touchy, but we still do talk about it
In Austria, and afaik it's the same in Germany, the nazi period is covered heavily in school and while I disagree with censoring Nazi imagery in video games, it's not done to sweep that period under the rug
>While it is perfectly fine to talk about the Nazi reign in Germany, saying sth like "if Hitler was in charge, the trains were on time
" would not be acceptable
I have heard jokes like "I can do whatever I want, because I built the Autobahn
" making fun of neo-nazis and it's pretty much the same thing
Or ironic statements like "This wouldn't have happened under Hitlers reign
", also pretty common
People joke about it sometimes, but it's definitely not a complete taboo
It always depends on who makes a joke, too
The closer you are to a subject, the more you can get away with
I mean, *I* can joke with my husband about our child's perceived flaws
If *you* would do that, you'd not see the next day
Similar with historical trauma
One man's very welcome comic relief is another man's super insensitive boundary stomp
Yes that is right
"Is ja ned alles gut was der Hitler gmacht hat" is another joke I hear, and say, occasionally
For those not in the know:
It means "not everything Hitler did was good" and is making fun of the saying "not everything Hitler did was bad". It's not something I'd say to my boss, a stranger, or my girlfriend's family, but among my friends and my family it always gets a laugh
Another example of german humour
The only game that's really available in my native language is minecraft lol
If I speak the original language then I will play it in that language
With most of my games that is English
German dubs are usually quite good though
I have one game where the main character talks in a cringy fake Southern accent, the German dub is much better
I once set my Steam language back to German to try it out and now play most games in German, here a table for what 'most' means:
high budget: probably good "dubbing" -> german
medium budget: prob
bad "dubbing" -> english
small budget: usually no importantvoice acting -> ger
tiny budget: probably very bad translations -> english
Also puns
Some wordplays simply dont translate
Farmers, people who speak dialect, have an obsession with tractors
A very big obsession
But tbh everybody around here is from a rural area, is a farmer etc etc
Here people who live in a city and aren‘t farmers are considered weird
Especially those that speak no dialect at all
But we don‘t have a fight with each other or smth
>liberal Munich
Did you just use the American "liberal"?
Yes but the only people who say "liberal" when they mean "social liberal" are Americans
So because of you German flag I wasn't sure, if you called Munich a center-right city or just used the American association
Why would you argue it's more correct
It said „liberal“ before he edited it
>And Americans aren't the only ones using that terminology
Canada comes to mind as another country were liberalism almost exclusively refers to "social liberarlism".
Who else does
Latin America and Europe do not
>"Liberal" also has the meaning of being an open/tolerant society, which is also the way I used it pretty much
True, but US politics sadly dominate the internet
I speak a German dialect and for people in my area it takes active effort to switch to standard German
At this point it feels more natural to speak English with my friends than standard German, just because I don't ever use it while talking
Most people are proud of it, but the downside to it is that my girlfriend, who's learning German, can't understand anything anyone here says and it's certainly making it a lot harder for her
I really do think that both her and my life would be easier if dialect wasn't so widespread here
No, this is the first time I've seen either of these
How are you folks reacting to that snow
I mean, you might not be that used to that stuff and be quite amazed, are you
Snow of course is common here in Austria, but even I am still quite amazed about how beautiful it is when there is a lot of snow (I live in an area which doesn't have that much snow usually, but we've got a lot of it on thursday and it was just beautiful)
So, Russian
;-)
Here in the alps sunrise is at around 8am and sunset is at around 5pm
Plenty of day left after sundown
Luckily this all happened on a weekend, right
Are you folks in a lockdown at the moment
This might help ease the chaos too
Imagine this happening on a weekday during normal, busy times
But there simply is something about snow that makes people feel good about it
(if you are not in an area which has snow ALL the time, then you quickly get annoyed by it)
thank you for the information
I have to say that 30cm of fresh snow would even (and have in the past) cause problems here in Austria in large cities
And we all have winter tyres on our cars (they are mandatory for these road conditions)
But they won't help that much when the snow is wet or mushy
(still gets very slippery)
At least the people are also having fun with the snow, which is great to see
They should just remember to stay safe and not hurt themselves
Other than wartime stuff and controlled explosions (tearing down buildings or in mining), probably an accident inside a FLAK-tower in Vienna 1944
Apparently there was an ammunition depot up there, that blew up because somebody mishandled something
It blew a considerable [notch] into this otherwise [pretty indestructible structure] (I'm not exaggerating, those towers are truly and awe-inspiringly hardy)
Several floors are missing
Either that, or some some [gas explosion] but that happens every few years sadly
Guys, if you wanna commit suicide, please don't do it like that
But those are all things that are measurable in my imagination
Like, I can imagine it happening, and why and how big
But that in Beirut is just beyond anything
So fucked up
I wish my country helps, so the Lebanese won't experience a huge famine catastrophy there (a lot of the country's wheat was blown up)
Italy: i love your way of life, your capacity to enjoy good and beautiful things, be it food, cars or fashion
France: as much as i'm sometimes taken aback by it, i also admire the pride you take in being French
We don't do that here
Greece: look at your heritage
Wow
Portugal: one of my earliest vacation memories is going there and i've wanted to go back ever since
And see Nazaré.
Spain: thanks for all the fruit you provide us with
Germany: your way of pragmatically running things right without much of a fuss is awesome
Croatia: as long as we have you, i couldn't care less to go on vacation at some fancy, far away destination
Your country is beautiful, your food is excellent and it's decidedly low-key
I like that
Switzerland: you've got direct democracy dialed
Netherlands and Denmark: your bicycle infrastructure is inspiring
Belgium: your beer is the best beer in the world
You're also home to my favourite racetrack Spa-Francorchamps and of course the best chips
Sweden: i couldn't afford to furnish my home if it wasn't for you guys
Norway: what can i say, you're probably best off of any country in the world
Also fjords
Finland: Saunas are life
Your racing drivers are unbelievable
Scotland: if i only had one alcoholic drink for the rest of my life it would be your singlemalt whisky
Also you're tied for my favourite language with
Ireland: you make some of the most beautiful music ever
You're all poets at heart, so i imagine
England: i love your quirkiness, your humour, your not taking yourselves too seriously
You brought us Lotus cars and Monty Python
And - this is going to be marmite for some - Marmite
If i were ever to move to another country, it would very likely be yours
&#x200B;
EDIT: thank you to u/joelherman for starting this series of loveletters to one another
love reading all the comments
beautiful idea, beautiful outcome
we need more of this kind of stuff
there's so many good things about each and every place, it's important we're reminded of those every now and again
Poland: you have many beautiful cities like Wroclaw, Kraków, Gdańsk and so many more
Also all people are really nice and when I tried to speak polish they were even more friendlier
France: I love the eating culture, French people seam  to enjoy their meals really and are not in a hurry
You also have one of the best culture
Spain: Spanish people are really outgoing and in general easiegoing
Btw I had some of the best parties with Spaniards
Italy: you have one of the most beautiful languages in the world
When you are talking it sounds just like a song, even though I don't understand a word I could listen to it always
At the risk of sounding incredibly immodest: yes
From our point of view, you seem to do everything just a tad better than we are
Not everything of course, but a lot
From the outside in you only see the things that are running better than at home
If you had a good idea in politics, we'll copy that and make it just a little less good when implementing it
If you had a bad idea, well, we probably had it before
Obrigado
Same here
Have done it since earliest childhood and still enjoy it
I usually drink milk/cholocate milk in place of coffee
However, I suspect I may be slightly lactose intolerant because I often feel like shit after
Love Milk
But only normal not light or long life milk
Best is directly from the farmer but thats very hard to get in the city
Unpasteurized milk, yes
But to me it's not a drink, it's food
I'm not fond of the after effects but the taste is good
I LOVE milk, i dink it literwise whenever I‘m home, god do I love milk
thank mr skeltal
"Am Arsch der Welt" - the ass of the earth
or "Hintertupfing", but I dont know the origin of this expression
so Djibouti
aka ADW
Or "Gigerizpatschen"
I work in a retirement home (as part of my civil service)
Situation was kinda bonkers yesterday, the closing of the Slovakian border hit us hard (we have a lot of nurses working in Austria and living in Slovakia)
Basically it's now forbidden to leave the country (I don't even know if that's legal), no holidays, and extra shifts
Also we are running low on desinfectant
So fun times ahead
Edit: Apparently our government worked with our Neighbors on letting those nurses pass the border again (with checks)
Small victories
Well, its definitley legal to close the borders
but the order not to leave the country comes from our Employer not the Goverment
Conscripts can't be sent out of the country afaik, and as we are not in a war ourselves it's not really dangerous to be a conscript
It's just mostly boring work without any benefits for society and shit pay
Hm, can't think of anything
Historical flack:
- Nationalsocialism
Austria didn't exist from 1938-45, and was part of Germany, but many Austrians were high ranking Nazis
A lot were illegal Nazis before 1938 (the NSDAP was illegal under the clerical-fascist Dollfuß/Schuschnigg-regime 1934-38), after the Anschluss those were the most fanatic Nazis, and they were considered the most loyal ones
- Imperialism
Austria never really was a colonial power, still it was a big empire and German Austrian as well as Hungarian elites treated the other peoples of the empire (but also their own) like shit
Also, Bosnia was essentially a colony, even if it wasn't *really* a colony
The way that the Austro-Hungarian elites pitted the orthodox Serbs, the catholic Croats and the muslim Bosniaks against each other in order to maintain power was reminiscent of British rule in India
I remember when I found out a few years ago, I was absolutely shocked that no one even talks about this
I also think that Amsterdam kinda got that rep for how they deal with drugs in general
Well, I think many countries do, just often it's not publicly known
&#x200B;
Nobody can tell me that in countries like China, US, Brazil etc
, no single person secretly imprisons family members for a long time
I dont know about tge rest of the Netherlands
The regular-Josef supporters: most probably became Nazis, otherwise arranged themselves with the new regime, or just shut up about it
So basically what everybody else did
The actual politicians of the Christian-Social Party (i.e. the leading force behind the move to Austro-fascism): they became Nazis, otherwise arranged themselves with the new regime, fled, or were sent to concentration camps along with their socialist arch-enemies
Adding to the other answers, look at eg
&#x200B;
This is the center of a major Austrian city, from above
Of course not the whole city looks like that, but in any case, a skyscraper wouldn't fit in at all
There is simply no need for them
We don't need to expand into the height, because our cities had a long long time to form
Also they dominate the view and very often look like shit
In Vienna, there are designated areas where skyscrapers can be built, but it's made sure they are far away from the city center and can't obstruct the view towards the inner city
Here, there are pretty strict regulations concerning height and overall look as well
I think the main argument is that skyscrapers next to buildings like the Hofburg, Grazer Uhrturm, Hallstatt/Hallein or other historical buildings that are extremely old-style just doesn‘t look right
Also I think the fire department would appreciate it too, if we don‘t have too many skyscrapers
I'm gonna warm up something from 10 years ago: [KROCH MA EINE
Vorder meiner, hinter meiner, links, rechts güts net
Ich komme
Before me, behind me, left, right doesn't count
I'm coming
There are many ways to say it here but the most direct one would be „Fertig oder nicht, ich komme
And it’s worse with the dialect: „Featig oda ned, i kum
>das „Oida“ (*Alter*) wird auch ohne sichtbaren Zusammenhang fast jedem Satz vor- oder hintangestellt
Wikipedia wieda amal faktisch unschlagbar lol
I think it's pretty much the same in Austria, or at least the part I'm from, "Versteckt oder nicht, ich komme" ("Hidden or not, I'm coming")
"sorry, we didn't know your aircraft was supposed to be invisible"
Oida
I mean, we didn't use standard german either, I just used it here for convenience/ease of understanding
What we actually said would be something like "Fasteikd oda ned, I kim/kum". :b
I mean, I get what you mean, but standard german is what people most commonly write in for a reason
I generally want people from Vorarlberg to understand me too, and vis versa for example
Not to mention non-Austro-Bavarians
In international waters it seems like the obvious choice, like, that's what it's there for
Plus, especially for things that are not just used by one (sub)dialect group, like this, I feel it makes sense to use standard as a way to "generalise". I know that the Burgenländer I live close to wouldn't pronounce it the same, for example, but they do use the phrase too
If I wrote in my sub-dialect and claimed it was what was used "in Austria", that would be more incorrect imo than saying that this standard German phrase is what is used
I guess you could add "but in dialect" after everything
But I doubt I'd think of it/remember, because it's so obvious to me that noone actually normally speaks perfectly proper standard German, especially not in Austria, that's weird, who does that
Also, ya know, not everyone can actually write dialect properly, myself included
There are actual rules for that, apparently, and I do not know them well enough to use them properly
Like, I'm pretty sure the spelling of Versteckt should be closer to "Vasteckd" or even stay "Versteckt", but neither properly show the pronunciation, so the point to writing in dialect instead of standard would be lost, while the way I spelt it gets the point across decently but looks wrong and probably still sounds off too
Like, do you actually pronounce "Versteckt" properly where you're from, or is the spelling just the same
And if it's just spelling, why bother
Agree to disagree I guess
Its nice you can read allemanic, but I have had a lot of trouble with it
I am very far to the east and I don't hear allemanic often at all, so I'm barely familiar with it
That's likely different in tyrol
Also, (Austro-)Bavarian has literal rules with grammar, spelling and all, I'm pretty sure they are actually written down and everything
Otherwise something like the Bavarian Wikipedia site would be kinda hard to do decently
Obviously the details for the pronunciation and mild deviations for spelling vary, similar to middle high German, but also like middle high German there are rules and not using them right makes sentences feel kinda off
And that spelling is also usually a lot closer to the standard spelling than what "phonetically" doing it would be
And if the only thing that changes is pronunciation, there is no point in writing dialect
No word I ever write is normally pronounced as it is written and intended
Not even by Germans from what I've witnessed, nobody i have ever met naturally pronounces words the perfectly right intended standard way, even if some of them try very hard
Because that's weird, it sounds weird
But that's also kinda the point I was trying to get at
We do absolutely use words like "ich" and "komme", those are common German words, it's just that nobody pronounces them that way
In written German, "ich", or occasionally "ick", especially further north, have been used for a long time, even though read aloud/spoken people would say "I", "Ig", "Ih" or whatever else
Because the spoken language/pronunciation, and the written language, meant to be legible in the next village over, are not the same
That's why I asked if you actually pronounce "Verstecken" as intended
Because you probably don't. The spelling just doesn't show that
And the "standard" way of spelling in (Bavarian) dialect is not much better from what I can tell
So what's the point in writing in dialect if you can't tell properly anyway because this alphabet can only convey so much
Even when spelling it closer to pronunciation that problem stays, plus now the words look/feel really weird
The only way to half way better get the point across while not looking really off would probably be to write in phonetic script, and I don't know how to do that
Also, my dialect is still not representative of even eastern Austria or Styria
There are too many dialects
It would be just as dishonest and weird to claim any specific dialect as the "Austrian" way as it would be to use the Standard one
Especially because Standard German is just kinda naturally replaced with umgangssprache or dialect in my head, while dialect is just needlessly specific dialect
So since the difference between written and spoken is usually so big/noticable anyway and there are a lot of possible pronunciations because 300+ (sub)dialects, it makes sense to me to use standard spelling when writing a generalised example like this
That's kinda what standard spelling is there for
Standard Austrian German is austrian
It's not the same as German standard German either in grammar or in spelling
"Ich komme" is valid Austrian German
In this case it also happens to be valid German German, but that doesn't change the fact
Also, my dialect is Bavarian, with Saxonian influences (and the occasional mispronounced slavic or hungarian term) If Austrian German doesn't count, neither should Bavarian
To the best of my knowledge, all german speaking children learn their respective standard similar to a foreign language, so I get where you're coming from with that, but to say it's a foreign thing entirely just isn't right
It doesn't sound right spoken because it's not really a "natural" language, but it is Austrian
I am reasonably sure the "proper" spelling for "ollwail" is "allweil" or "alleweil". Less common than "immer", but i am pretty sure it's a real word, like, in the dictionary and all
"Immer" would just be "imma", I don't think I've ever used anything else, ollwail is more something that, like, my grandfather might say if that
I also don't see the difference between pronouncing "aber" "owa" and pronouncing "ich" "I". At least "I" shares a letter with "ich". There are terms I've only ever heard in dialect/that might only exist in dialect or at least wouldn't know how to translate, but non of those are involved here
This is pretty much just pronunciation, which in german tends not to match spelling
It never did, even before standardisation
I generally translate or not based first on how weird or off the standard would sound, and then how understandable the word is
I could see maybe not wanting to translate "kukaruz" into "Mais" for example, since that's literally not the same language, though I probably would still write "Mais" for something like this since variants of "Moazen/Mais" are much more common to my knowledge and used in my region as well so it doesn't sound totally off
Or I'd probably write "Erdapfel" instead of "Grumba". But I wouldn't translate "leiwand" or "oida", even though oida  clearly just means "Alter". Cause it'd sound too weird
If it doesn't sound too off and is semi understandable I generally use Standard or Umgangssprache for writing, unless it's, like, a text message or something like that maybe
Admittedly I usually write in Umgangssprache, not proper standard, too
I just prefer using the standard when giving more generally meant examples like this
Mind it
I welcome it, as long as they don't do it to make fun of us
I am always  happy when a German who lived here for some time adopts the essential phrase " es geht sich nicht aus" I don't know how you can live without it
Edit: fucking English keyboard won't let me write in German
I'd rather have them adapt
But nothing is more annoying than Germans in Austria laughing at Austrian words like "haha lol 'Sackerl' learn German please"
It's more annoying if they don't do it
You can keep your Tüte
I mean, like, it helps, a lot
But not if they use a forced dialect, that‘s just awful
Like, Germans are often fascinated by my (or Austrian in general) dialect (working in a restaurant, during holidays Germans often come here), and I mean, it‘s fine that they are and often fun, that they ask me how we call certain things, but p l e a s e don‘t try to butcher our dialect, especially if you can‘t speak certain sounds
(I‘m thinking of a certain conversation I had: „Hey, what do you call this
*holds up a chopping board* - Me: „ Br-ä-idl“ - She: „br-A-itl
“ — and I tried to correct her and she continued to call it that and god fucking dammit it really annoyed me (I know I sound rude but come on
Again, if they use our vocabulary it‘s fine for me, because especially working in a restaurant, as said lol, it helps, sometimes
Ofc I know the proper german words for the thing, but sometimes my brain just flatlines and I‘m just staring at the person for minutes and forgot what it was
(Apfelschorle, Traubenschorle, Weinschorle are often words where my brain flatlines lol)
And I have to adapt to the German vocabulary when I‘m in Germany too, because they barely know certain words or have never heard of them
Kren, Gelsen, Erdäpfel, Polster, Spatzen (no, not the bird) to name a few words my German friends often ask me about
The interesting part is of this is, that us Austrians often don´t even know that a word is not used in "German German". For example: We use "Jänner" for "Januar". My ex-gf is from Hannover and she needed some time to adapt to certain words that are just normal for us here
Or when we say something like "Dreiviertel Vier" for 15:45h. Or the word "ein bisschen". And then there´s the word "eh" which is a story for itself
:D and that´s just the ones I can think of now, there for sure are many many more
Reminds me when I tried to buy Semmeln in a German bakery
The making fun part is one thing
What is more common in my experience is the condescending way of telling the Austrians and Swiss they don't speak "proper German". Like german German would be the proper one
I find that super annoying
(Never happens with Bavarians, I guess they might be told the same)
I remember one german co-worker being very annoyed because the baker he went to was talking English to them all the time
I wonder why :-D
Yes
I was shocked when I first heard that Germans don‘t use that phrase
Like, how can somebody possibly live without it
I think Portemonnaie is in the German vocabulary/dictionary
But damn, that‘s interesting
Now I have one reason more to be overly interested in hearing swiss german (not speaking it tho, I will 100% butcher it)
nope, not at all
since people would probably recognize your accent anyway, as long as you don't speak 100% in cockney to everybody and expect them to understand what you say, you'd be fine
nope, not at all, since people would probably recognize your accent anyway
as long as you don't speak 100% in cockney to everybody and expect them to understand what you say, you'd be fine
Baasst, gemma mochma, des wird a Hetz
I wanted to ask you if you‘re from Bavaria until I saw the flare-
But yeah, your dialect is pretty similar to ours, so I understand why Austrian won‘t change it, you‘ll probably understand us nonetheless (I think
They basically ask if eg German still as example: A german would mind if an Austrian would speak AUSTRIAN German and if an Austrian would speak German German
E.g. for me - if I would mind a german saying gespritzter Apfelsaft, Kren, Gelsen, Erdäpfel, Polster, etc etc or if a German would mind if I say Apfelschorle, Meerrettich, Mücken, Kartoffeln, Kopfkissen, etc etc
Also, no, that‘s not how languages work
A federal state is not more important than a country
Especially when the country is older than the federal state
Swiss people also don‘t speak Vorarlberger German, they speak Swiss German
Just like Austria doesn‘t speak Bavarian German, but Austrian German
Bavaria probably doesn‘t even learn words like the ones mentioned above in school and it would be wrong to write them down, while for us they’re literally in our dictionary
Surely nobody would call a Krapfen a Pfannkuchen, no
A Pfannkuchen is flat and not filled with anything
I hate it when they pronounce the word "Palatschinken" like this "Palat-Schinken". That´s not at all how this is pronounced here
In Vienna the waiters beat you
Grüß Gott is the normal polite greeting, I would appreciate it
"Baba" is used very informally or towards kids, so better not use that
Even "Tschüss" sounds way too informal to me, always made me queasy when I heard it being used in business settings
Probably because our local variant "Tschau" is only used with friends
If it's strangers, I think the only correct way to say Goodbye would be "Auf Wiedersehen" (Especially if you're not comfortable using the more local/colloquial "Auf Wiederschaun")
I know what you're talking about
great way to put that feeling in words, thanks
I really feel your pain
Due to Youtube, it's really bad with Austrian kids and germanisms these days
Love it how you use 4 words for meat patty in Germany and non of them are used in Austria
Fleischlabberl Masterrace
My ex gf definitely didn´t know the word "Jänner" for "Januar" and asked me about it
And the excessive use of "eh" is not common in northern Germany neither I think
(or at least in Hannover, which I would consider an area with a very strong "Hochdeutsch")
Oh, and then there was this time when I really really insulted a waiter in Hannover when I said that serving the soup and the main dish at the same time was "vollkommen idiotisch" and never before I had to tell a waiter that I would not like to have them served at the same time before as it wouldn´t make any sense at all
His reply "Nun, wenn ich so ein Vollidiot bin" showed me that he did take that too literally, while here it wouldn´t be considered that awful but more as a figure of speech
(of course I apologized and told him that this was a misunderstanding and tipped well afterwards)
Heast, des schreibt ma "Laberl". Ein B.
"Laberl" mit langem "a" oida
Kommt von "Leib"
Faschiertes Laberl masterrace btw
This is also true for the first two things on the list:
Brötchen is Weckerl (Semmel is a certain type of white bread Weckerl)
Metzger is Fleischhauer
I would just say "Auf Wiederschauen". Tschüss is ok when coming from a German though, then it is not considered rude
"baba" is too informal though normally
Not if it's not kids I think
We normally say Tschau, you can guess where that comes from
I wouldn't have spelled it "Labberl" like the other commentor, but "Laberl", as the "a" is long
labbrig is used in this context but „labberl“ als in Fleischlabberl refers to a form of the word „Leib“ or „Leibchen“
yeah, came here to say, that they are called faschiertes laberl
Es kommt von "Laib" Leiberl kommt von "Leib"
> I forget to ask about that, I'm from Berlin and here it means something like "sowieso", does it maybe have a different meaning in Austria
We use it really really much and the meaning can vary
For example: "Hast du das eh schon gemacht
" which doesn´t translate to "sowieso" at all
It roughly means: "Hast du das bereits gemacht
". Just one example that comes to my mind, I am sure there are many others
I think this was the one she struggled the most with
yeah but that's spelled "Laberl" buddy, not "Labberl". or were you thinking of a "Lapperl"?
IIRC Franco changed Spain's timezone to CET to be in the same timezone as the Third Reich, but that might be anecdotally
Did the Spanish always eat dinner as late as now, or do you think that's a consequence of the timezone you're in
You need to watch more Karambolage
Wait, what
Do they really do that
I personally only do some peaceful shopping, buying beer, kofola and some slovak food
They probably started the habit to go to duty free shops between the countries and now that there is no border keep on driving to the next slovakian store
Are they going on a sunday
Then it will be shoppoholics that think of buying stuff as a hobby
It transferring money really such a big deal, don’t they/you all have IBAN/BIC
>All the cashmoney in my wallet after I return from holiday
Hard to earn money under the table if everything is electronic
/s ^^^^not ^^^^really
Yes, that's what I mean
So relative to the sun, you eat at a "normal" time, if you can call it that, but due to the time zone it's "late".
The only Austrians I know who go to Slovakia for shopping are Slovaks living in Austria :D
Because they don't sell this kind of "trash" in austria and it's interesting to try
but driving there solely for buying this stuff is a bit weird
I did it once after a trip to some city with friends and afterwards we hung out at my apartment and tried all the disgustingly sweet food with bad artificial flavourings
Felt horrible afterwards but it was fun :)
of course its the Viennese, who would have thought
i regularly go there by bike or car, have lunch and a walk
It is close enough for a day trip, and the best thing is, you dont have to deal with grumpy Viennese :D
Really

Some don‘t even have german names by deafult, like, I recently googled what chapstick would be in german and the *dicitionary* said there‘s labello and labello only
We call tape "Tixo". In Germany it's called Tesafilm I think
Isn't duct tape just one specific type of tape
The silver one
Son in german panzer band or Industrieklebeband
Tesa is just sticky tape or the brand name scotch tape
Yeah but duct tape is only the big silver one as I understand
It was made during ww2 to the ammunition  dry, but the soldiers realized they could fix jeeps and everything with it
I always though duct tape is the large stuff
I may be wrong, but I don't think anyone refers to scotch tape as duct tape
I don't think panzerband is called tesa, or is it
No worries
I just couldn't resist
But I do hope the information comes in handy some day
In upper Austrian dialect "Pfrundsblodschn" means both kite and dragon
It can also refer to a gullible foreigner
But when spoken there is no chance of misunderstanding as the first meaning has its emphasis on UM the latter on FAHREN

He proceeded to ask me if I find it weird too that he got arrested

Now you finally figured out why we queue for the loos, and always go in pairs or groups
In a recent episode of Rick & Morty, there is a quick line in the original english version that is in german
When watching it I only subconsciously thought "huh, that sounded weird for some reason" and it wasn't until I read reddit about the episode a while later that I realized it's in german
Understanding actually
They knew that was insensitive, but found the arrest over the top
Someone that was with me at that moment asked if that isn't against free speech and all, but - after a brief history lesson - both agreed why we take the Verbotsgesetz very seriously
Well tbh, when I'm abroad, I'd gotten used to saying that I was from Austria and, when I was met with strange looks, following that up with "the country south of Germany
Also, we'd been talking for a while, so the conversation went there quite naturally
I've been there in March

Yes
That's the name
Two friends and I slept at a hosting family house (hope I say it right xD) in Silverknowes street
So we hadn't much of a walk there
I guess "Restoesterreich" (residual Austria) would be one term
Hungary and Austria are quite similar in that regard that a huge percentage of people are living in the capitol (20+%) which is very uncommon afaik
Not really
I mean, there are a few words for rural areas or the middle of nowhere, Provinz, Pampas, Hinterland, Arsch der Welt etc
but it doesn't really apply to other cities or larger towns and definitely not to everything outside Vienna as a whole
"Provinz" in Austria
And yes, it is used in derogatory sense since the country is heavily centered around Vienna
If anything it's the other way around, everybody making fun of poor Berlin
At least these are the jokes I always hear from Germans
Isn´t it always the other way round in austria that all the other states are looking down on vienna and "die gschissenen Werner"? Even "Gscherte" in vienna isn\`t so much used for people from the countryside but more for viennese from the poorer city districts
Well, "Die Provinz" is a much more fitting term actually used by people in Vienna
It's mostly used to refer to lower Austria, but can also mean "anywhere in Austria except Vienna".
Someone coming from the countryside can be (derogatorily) referred to as "Gscherta" (person, who's head has been sheered)

Ganz schön peinlich
Aber ich mein ganz im Ernst, alle anderen hier bekommen es ja wohl hin, auf Englisch zu antworten
Welchen Mehrwert hat dein Beitrag denn für Leute die Griechisch nicht sprechen
Wenn ich Griechisch lesen wollen würde, würde ich ja wohl in einen griechischen Subreddit gehen
Dein Beitrag: unnecessary
Nein nein, ich finde nur die Ironie dahinter lustig
Warning: like all responses in this comment section, this post is full of stereotypes, generalizations, and subjective and biased observations
Don't take it all too seriously
Like most **Central Europeans**, **Austrians** often dress very blandly and cheap and not particularly stylish in general (exceptions exist of course)
Kinda stuck in the late 2000s. Either that or very conservatively, which is a safe bet, but a bit boring
Also, there's barely variations in occasions
Going out, hanging out at home, going to work; the same outfit is fine for all those things
The really "stylish" Austrians always end up looking like what Berliner hipsters looked like 3 years ago
In **Italy** in my excperience it's like this: either you see people dressed like Armani models, or dressed super trashy
There's overlaps, and there's a little room in between, but very little
But whichever it is, it's always lots of brands (fake or real), and there's *always* (even with the best outfit) that one little detail which makes the whole thing completely over the top
Often the shoes or the sunglasses
Italians are extreme tight-rope-walkers and it's really very fascinating
But I guess you can't be fashionable and innovative if you're not daring
Donatella Versace embodies this spirit of Italian clothing prefectly
The basics are relatively stylish and fancy, but then there's that touch that just pushes it over the top towards the brink of trashy
**Spanish** people generally dress well, but often they all look similar, because in the end everybody buys the same Inditex stuff
Guys very often wear long sleeved shirts, and women for some reason tend to have a faible for high-plateaued shoes [like this] or [this] No idea why
This trend has been going on for a few years already
When I see a woman with ridiculously high shoes in Vienna, chances are at around 70% she's Spanish
Also, Spanish people (also Italians) really dress up when they go out
Which is nice
**Basque** people in particular are a bit weird
Especially the borroka ones often look like they're about to climb a mountain
Even when they aren't about to do that
They seem to love expensive functional outdoor clothing from the holy 3: Mammut, Ternua, Patagonia
Either that, or it's everything stripes
Or T-shirts with political messages written in Basque (e.g. Altsasukoak aske)
And when Basque men have to be fancy, a chequered shirt is the solution
And don't get me even started on the hairstyles
**Brits** have some similarities with Italians
Either they're Alexa Chung, or completely off-the-charts trashy and chav
Whichever it is, you can see, they really like to make an impression
You personally don't like how you think all Germans dress
No need to be a bitch about it tbh
my tip would be: wear tighter-fitted pants and avoid certain types od shoes (wear either boots, leather shoes, or fashionable converse)
also you can't really go wrong with long-sleeve shirts
try to dress as what you feel to be "smart". and muted colors
I'd avoid sneakers, sweatpants, or baggy clothes; nothing with logos on it; nothing too casual; and nothing too colorful
good news is that accessorizing  is ok for guys and is kinda fun (nice scarf,  bag, etc)
I live 20 min away from the Italian border and the fact that in the north of Italy, more specific the region SouthTyrol,  the majority is German speaking it doesn't fell like beeing in a foreign country
I ll go there occasionally with my friends or family there just for eating a pizza or drinking a coffee  or to hang out there somewhere
There is a train going every hour to Italy so it is really easy to go there
With the ID i think it is mandatory to have it with you but in realty no one ever checked for it, so its not a big deal if you don't have it with you
In border cities
Very often, I'm sure
A friend of mine lives in Germany near the French border and she does a lot of her day to day grocery shopping in France
The Swiss go shopping into neighboring countries all the time because food is less expensive there
Living in Austria, I have relatives in Germany that I visit 2-3 times every year
I’ve also been to Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Vatican City and France (if Corsica counts)

Absolutely not
I used to fly to the uk quite regularly, so was very much used to the passport controls within eu
Then I flew to Rome, walked out the airport and realised not once did I have to get out the passport

This can vary

I read that as „Persians“ and was really confused what the connection between them and the Arc de Triomphe roundabout was
There are quite a few loanwords in my dialect that don't exist in standard German like "liesnen" meaning to listen
Handy means mobile phone in german
It's just the english word handy, yet in english it doesn't mean phone
So it's a loan word that means something entirely different
My favourite is one “șmecher”. It comes from German Schmecker/schmecken where it means taster/to taste
However, in Romanian it means a cunning/sly person
The story goes that centuries ago, Germans from Transylvania crossed the mountains south to Oltenia to sell their handcraft and buy quality wine
The locals played the good hosts, fed the Germans well and got them drunk with their strongest wine, which they weren’t quite used to
Only then did they start bargaining for the price of the crafts, while also selling the Germans a different, worse wine that the one they agreed upon tasting, without them noticing until they got back home
So next year they return, eat, drink and cheer again with the locals
Only this time the Germans choose a wise guy to stay sober this whole time and only step in when it came to discussing the price and choosing the wine, so that they don’t get fooled again
And so they presented him to the locals: “Das ist der Schmecker”.
So a “șmecher” became a person who is hard to fool
The word evolved further in Romanian, so now you also have it as an adjective = cool, șmecherie=trick/guile/cool thing, a șmecheri - to fool someone, etc
Cearșaf, ciorapi and cișmea made their way into Romanian as well
We also use “musai” with the same meaning in Romanian
I was mindblown when I found out where it comes from a while ago when learning German
Definitely Slovenian, there are a lot of folks who speak Slovenian in Carinthia but not due to recent migration, the so called "Carinthian Slovenians" ("Kärntner Slowenen" in German) are often indistinguishable from other Austrians, since they speak accent-free German like the typical Austrian, (some have a Slavic-like surname but that is all) but they speak Slovenian among them in order to maintain the cultural heritage
Alas, in the Nazi-era, these people were harassed and speaking Slovenian was forbidden
I honestly don‘t know
I‘d say my first guess is slovenian, because of Cyrinthia
(I think at the border they often speak slovenian and sometimes get taught that in school
Or maybe hungarian
I‘m really not sure tho
If you would split Serbo-Croatian in Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian, Turkish would be the on the top
And if we are talking high school level, it's probably French or something ;)
Yes I know, it is like the difference in Austrian German and Norm high German, basically it is the same language, some people may feel offended if you tell them they speak Serbo-Croatian
In the neue mittelschule (Age 10-14) you get thought things like typing, navigating on pc, saving/opening files, basic word/excel/powerpoint , send/read emails and things like that
My old school recently added some big things to what they teach like more advanced excel and even scratch (programmimg language developed to teach young people)
I would say that is early enough for teaching them things like that
You don't really need it for anything befor that
It's a catastrophe here ... Teacher are clueless and the government things the solution are tablet classes ...

Wow, I've never seen someone from French Polynesia around

Ive never heard about it until now, but after reading a bit about it i'm intrigued to hear some stories, if you dont mind :)
I'm from a rather rural area and I can tell you that many young people smoke weed occasionally
It's mostly the older people (like 40+) who are still very conservative
Edit: rural area in Upper Austria
Oh I'm sure about that, you guys smoke a ton of weed to come down from all of the Crystal you use over there :p

Lol
I'm not really into weed or drugs so I don't know anything haha

Welcome to onomatology
put all these stuff away
> forgetting to use articles
Slavic and Turkish speakers do the same thing in German, they tend to omit articles and sometimes even prepositions
Apparently this happens because they don't have those features (well at least articles, they must have some form prepositions I suppose, but IDK) in their languages, so they have a harder time getting a feeling for the appropriate use
A famous example for how Viennese German dialect/slang has been changing over the recent decades (due to the influence of immigrants from Slavic countries and Turkey) is "Gehen wir zum BILLA" (Let's go to the supermarket) turning into "Gehen wir BILLA" (Let us go supermarket)
The fun thing about this is that the basic meaning of the sentence remains, and the informative value is still clear as day
The (dative) article is actually really unnecessary here, so is the preposition, because obviously we are going TO the supermarket, where else would we go; definitely not under it
This phenomenon is still quite prevalent among 2nd and 3rd generation immigrant children, so prevalent actually, that many "autochthonous" people (i.e. at least several generations of German speakers), especially in urban areas, have started using it in colloquial speech as well (I catch myself doing it sometimes, it's just shorter)
A friend of mine, who is a lower secondary grade teacher, once told me an interesting anecdote about a conversation between to ~12 year old students of her that went something like this:
A: "He, gib mir Lineal
" ("Hey, hand me ruler")
B: "Bist du deppert oder was
Das heißt 'Gib mir Lineal bitte
'" ("Are you stupid or what
That's 'Hand me ruler please
'")
While speaker B realized that something was "wrong" about speaker A's sentence, he didn't notice the grammatical inaccuracy, because the semantic meaning of the sentence was clear (btw: the grammatically "correct" way would be "Gib mir *das* Lineal" - "Hand me *the* ruler")
Rather he pointed out the pragmatic inaccuracy, namely that he was missing the "please" as a sign of politeness/respect (which is a very Austrian thing to do)
Coming back to the topic at hand, you can spot *the* native German speakers, but also some *the* Romance-language speakers, by the exact opposite thing, namely *the* overusage of *the* articles, and using *the* articles in places they're not necessary

My mom left Poland about 23 years ago too, because she needed a job
I think if you can speak a lil bit german or maybe learn the dialect of the region you‘re going to, you‘ll be fine here
Much luck to you, hope everything works out
(Especially now with our uncertain future)
Well Eisenbahn is more like "iron path", not "road". But still similar
Iron path sounds like right from a 70's Hongkong Kung-Fu Flick
Iron Path
Works too, yeah
If you go off road, the alps, but ither than that you'll topically see a smaller farming village every few minutes
Parts of the Alps and a few smaller national parks
Otherwise no, we suffer from a very cluttered population, which destroys the natural beauty of the country
In some places, it looks like someone has emptied a giant garbage bag over the hills
Not really untouched but there are some places where you will not see a dingle human for miles
My gf's almost 90 year old great uncle lives almost like hermit, in the Pyrenees
He lives in the outskirts of a midsized village 30 minutes from Donostia, deep in the forest, on a mountain, deep in a national park
He doesn't speak any Spanish, although he understands it a little bit
When I visited, my gf had to translate everything I said
But he understood my question about the number of his sheep, "drenta-tzinko" he responded
He's unable to form a whole sentence in Spanish though
He speaks an old dialect of Gipuzkoan Basque that almost nobody else speaks anymore, like a living fossil
During the dictatorship he used to smuggle stuff from France to Spain for a living, since he lives very close to the two countries' official border
He once told us, how his first job was smuggling a huge backpack full of condoms, because condoms (as well as abortions) were illegal under Franco
But he also smuggled other things that were legal but hard to get, like nylon tights, or random stuff, like alarmclocks
Imagine smuggling a whole bunch of old-timey alarm clocks through a forest in the dead of night, with the Guardia Civil looking for you
I'd be afraid that one of them goes off all of the sudden
Anyway
that guy does not believe in God or the Afterlife, even though his 300 years old house is full of Marias and crucifixes
He says "If there's a life after death, then where the hell is everybody
" He does not believe that the world is 2/3rds ocean, he thinks it is impossible, even if his own brother went fishing all the way to Greenland back in the day, and told him about the vastness of the ocean
He also does not believe that a man has been to the moon, because that's impossible
He never got married, because he doesn't trust anybody enough
I don't think he's ever been to Donostia
I assume he has seen the sea (he lives literally 15 car minutes from the coast), but I wouldn't even be surprised if he hasn't. With his almost 90 years he still has over 30 sheep that he looks after and he leads them onto their pastures high in the mountains
He has a microwave, he got it as a present once, but he has never used it, and uses it as storage room for plates and stuff instead
The only heating in his house is his tradtional old school open fire place
He has two stoves, an old iron one that works with fire, and a new electric one
Guess which one he almost never uses
Now that he's so old, once a week my gf's dad has to bring him groceries from the village, so he doesn't have to go down
There is a road going to that house, however that road is less than 15 or 20 years old, and if you don't know exactly which turns you have to take you'd never find the place
I know I wouldn't. He also has been smoking like a chimney ever since he was 14 years old, but he's still exceptionally fit for his age
He's too stubborn to quit, and he's too stubborn to get cancer
Recently he's made a list of 15 people he knows that according to him should to die already, because they do not serve any purpose anymore in this world
Three of those people had already died in the last two years, and he put himself on that list as well
His family has been telling him in recent years that he's been getting too old to live all the way there on the mountain, all alone, but he's too stubborn, and says, he was born in that house, has spent all his live in that house, and he will die in that house
He is the personification [of this Basque poem] He is probably the most Basque man I have ever met
Had to google that island, I always love geographical curiosities like that
Pretty much all of it are man-made environments too though
You won't find miles of untouched nature in Austria
You can find a lot of untouched land
North and South America have huge untouched parts
Same goes for Africa, Australia and Asia
Just not in most of Europe
Thanks for the info, u/Big_Dirty_Piss_Boner
>How do you feel about the return of the wolf
The wolf has no place in Germany and Austria
Trying to force wolves to repopulate the area is dumb, because they'll never be able to live a natural life in our man-made environment
The ecosystems we created over the centuries in Europe have no place for wolves
There is no point in trying to bring them back
I see what you did there and I approve of it
Fun fact: We had several head of states born in places which were part of Austria-Hungary the time they were born but weren't part of the Republic when they became head of the state (e.g. Karl Renner)
I'm not sure how it's going to be today, we had a minor controversity because the minister of Justice was born in former Yugoslavia and fled with her parents to Austria, but it was really minor
As the president is elected directly at least half of the people should be ok with that
Really depends
If they were born in European countries of similar cultures it wouldn't cause much fuss I think
Generally the more different the culture the more controversial
To be exact it was 3
Karl Renner was born 1870 in Untertannowitz (Dolní Dunajovice) in southern Moravia, then part of Austria-Hungary
His successor Theodor Körner was born 1873 in Újszőny bei Komorn (now part of Komárom) in Hungary, then Austria-Hungary
His successor Adolf Schärf was born in 1890 in Nikolsburg (Mikulov) in southern Moravia again
All the others were from today's Austria:
Franz Jonas 1899, Floridsdorf, then Lower Austria, now Vienna
Rudolf Kirchschläger 1915, Niederkappel in Upper Austria
Kurt Waldheim 1918, St
Andrä vor dem Hagenthale in Lower Austria
Thomas Klestil 1932, Vienna
Heinz Fischer 1938, Graz
Alexander van der Bellen 1944, Vienna
All the 1st Republic Presidents (Seitz, Hainisch, Miklas) were born in Lower Austria (Seitz was born in Vienna, which was still part of Lower Austria)
> a minor controversity because the minister of Justice was born in former Yugoslavia
The only ones really complaining were the ones who like to complain about every fart that comes out of any non-Austrian ass
I.e. the Freedom Party
Alma Zadic got legit threats over this, that's the scary part
Well, our last two friendships didn't work out that great for everyone else, so we decided that to be alone for now
Uhm
well
Italy
Germany
Neither
Hungary
Meh
I guess we're just
Lonely
Kann man fragen warum du dich als Liechtensteiner ausgibts
Probably because the family of Liechtenstein has quite some claims on Czech lands
Not really, even right now Germans are patrolling the border to Austria because of "the refugee crisis".
We like some of you
Like bavaria
and Munich
And upperBavaria
Aufm Austria sub is er mit Vorarlberg betitelt
Er muss Zivildienst machen also ist er österrei hischer Staatsbürger
Es lässt sich laut seiner Posthistory schließen, dass er in Vorarlberg wohnt
Abgesehen davon, dass es keinen Sinn machen würde als nicht Liechtensteiner dort zu leben
An und für sich ist das ja alles egal, dennoch frage ich mich warum er r/Askeurope hinters Licht führen will
I like Germans
I'm from Austria
Nice username
That indeed is rare
Offensichtlich
Liechtenstein is ja ned in Österreich
Und wer sagt, dass es die Wehrpflicht nur in Österreich gibt
That name doesn't make sence
Why would you call us südost-northwest austria
True
Also aus Österreich nach Liechtenstein ausgezogen
Und wie isses dort
Yeah, tons of middle aged guys wear those cringy [Camp David] shirts
That's almost all shirts from run-of-the-mill stores like H&M. Most have something to do with sports, California, surfing, or boats
And some random year dates
Guess the designers figure "surfing on the beaches of California is something unoffensive all potential customers can agree on
I don't get why, but a lot of people wear them
H&M and all the other stores have them aplenty in their stores
If anybody who likes them reads this: Why
Yeah, I have some of them too and honestly I've got no idea what the text means
Its a comic, but its pretty much true
These shirts are literally made with randomizers
Yeah, those are the ones I most commonly see too
"Daytona Beach" with a load of random English words also seems common to me
That's because Camp David is an actual brand sold at Peek & Cloppenburg
Which tells you why it's all middle aged guys haha
> Why
Copied from above: It's because it makes as much sense as other shirts with English words on them, like "University of New York" or "Surfing Championship '85". Any significance in meaning that might have existed over the pond is gone; over here, it's always just words so the shirt doesn't look empty
Once you accept that, it makes a lot of sense, because nobody fucking cares what's on the shirt, as long as the font looks nice
It's so that the shirt is not "just blue", but "blue with some orange details on it" instead
>middle aged men from central/eastern Europe
So basically middle aged Austrians ;)
Supply and demand
So its literally just visual noice
Welp, at least it explains it
We Austrians are Frivans though
Nothing against a pattern or whatever
I just think that nonsense words are an odd choice for a visual
Thanks for the startup idea
I mean we *do have* some of the best tap water in the world
As an Austrian, I wouldn´t know how to define it
Not as far as dry as the German humor, not as witty as British humor
We do enjoy some dirty jokes, but I wouldn´t know if there was any typical Austrian humor
Well, we like to joke about Germans
But that is pure compassion, so that they are least somehow funny
No selfdeprication and if it is in a very anti hero mode
All deflection
And dark, dirty, gross af so everybody backs off
Edit: the goal is to be the most unsympathetic character you can be if you want to be "the funny guy" in Austria
What have black humour and a black guy in common
Both are unwanted
^ that describes it pretty well
Aka the darker your humour is, the better it comes off
Oe just discrimlnatory over all
Me, a closted pansexual, always feels weird when people make jokes about gay people, sometimes even people who _know_ I‘m pansexual and accept it
German humor is no laughing matter
I would add "very sarcastic", especially the typical Viennese sense of humour
If I had to sum it up in one word:
morbid
In media it's generally fairly dark and absurd but played straight
Pythonesquely absurd while focusing not on the absurd but making it seem believable
at least in my media bubble
Obviously this changes, there's everything from light hearted humour to offensive, self depricating stuff
A lot of productions that are comedic or at least have a comedic side are so precisely because of a lack of focus on the comedy
Imagine smth like The Life of Brian if it were presented as a serious drama
Examples of comedy coming from absurd/ dark stuff played straight:
The Brenner films (2000-?)
Fink fährt ab (1999 film)
Aufschneider (2010 tv film)
Braunschlag (2012 tv show)
Toni Erdmann (2016 film)
Drei Eier im Glas (2015 film) and Contact High (2009 film) sort of fit as well although these ones definitely focuses on the absurd much more
Sorry for the wall of text
Italian tales of heroism
Delicious english food
Yes
Jokes about death are always a burner
Id add Muttertag - Mothers day as a classic early 90ties example
Defined punchlines in youth culture in Vienna for years
Wouldn´t the more German answer be: "Why the hell do you knock at this time of the day
MITTAGSRUHE, VERDAMMT NOCHMAL
I will call the police if you knock again
Not really a breakdown but Covid coincided withebthe start of our new conservative/green coalition government
The head of the Green party, Vice Chancelor and upon other things responsible for sport got on a minute long rant about sport clubs not adhering to the covid rules, threatening to remember any who defied him to cut their subsidies next year
It was really funny moment as he had portraid himself as a laid back bohemian up until then
He went full authoritarian on youth sports, trying to outdo his new coalition partner on strict measures
In Romania as well
There were multiple different ocassions, but i remembered about this one
There are 2 senators or deputies one in opposition and one from the ruling party and they are argue about what they did or did not do
Then there are some insults regarding one of the names that sounds similar to "Bidet" (Bideu in romanian - the place neart the toilet where you wash your ass
Then this happens:
Danes seem to have a remarkably bad streak of luck in military matters since the end of the Kalmar Union
How harsh could that sentence be for someone to literally hang themselves
Dude is nuts
How radical-right faux-pas in our right-wing party FPÖ are just one "isolated case" after the other
That we were the first victim of Nazi Germany
Although it's more of a narrative than a running joke
Elaborate
And the democratically elected president for all eternity
Same here, it's probably to give parents a bit of time to prepare, not everyone has a nanny waiting at home
I personally find it funny that the last coalition entailed two parties which both created fascist states in Austria independantly from each other
And that no member of the ÖVP got any flak for their fascist experiment back in their CS days in 34
Not to speak of the proto FPÖ members going all scotfree
I bet [this guy] disagrees
Which worldmap
We are allready closing down schools
Latest on wednesday everything has to be closed
They are even talking about banning all travel in/out of the most infected areas (mostly vienna, graz and innsbruck)
I love your language but everytime I see a polish text I have the urge to send you a gift basket with some more vowels
> It didn't happen/ they deserved it
Schrödinger's Turk
They're sound, when you think about it
Well, not really
High schools are closed
Primary and middle schools will still be open, just not in class
Parents can keep their children at home and look after them, or they can send them to school to be watched there
They won't be learning anything new there
Ah okay
My gf is from Gipuzkoa, and she always says how Bilbainos are all unos flipados and how they are super fixated on Bilbao
I don't know where you get this
My mother is teaching in middle school and they will close down completly
The only thing they do is to give then working material for the next weeks and then the school is closed for everyone
I got this from the official communique by the government
Since primary and middle schools aren't managed federally, they can have other measures put in place
But there isn't a countrywide closedown
I mostly follow politics in other countries when our news outlets report on them so that's mostly the big countries (Germany, France, Italy, UK) or where things aren't going to well (Hungary, Poland, etc
may I ask why you follow Austrian politics in particular
and what your take on it is
I‘m more interested in EU politics than in Austrian politics because I have honestly no clue what the fuck is going on in my country and what all of the politicians are even doing
It‘s like everything is in dutch or smth: I feel like I need to understand it and if I try really hard I can understand the context but overall I have no clue what‘s going on
>  Austrian because it is comedic in a fun way
Sounds about right
It's sad if it actually affects you though
Yeah, the Socialdemocrats did a good job in Vienna
And good luck on moving here (whenever that‘ll be) :)
Actually it all started with Haider, the OG Strache
Ok now you've got me hooked, I will follow czech politics from here on out
Vienna
People there ask for cigarettes, without saying "Bitte".
Wait what makes it scary
The stories
But otherwise its just a hill, or a small mountain, right
Still better than huge ass-spiders
Before Jimmy Page bought it, it was owned by Aleister Crowley
He is said to have some of his demonic rites there
To add to all that, the house sits on the shores of Loch Ness
I recently listened to a podcast about Andrées expedition to the north pole with a hot air balloon, that ended in an usolved mystery in north eastern svalbard
so yep, that fits
EVERYONE does it
I know people my age who drink so much every weekend that they pass out or have a blackout, there are no real consequences and alcohol is also easily accessible
It was only changed last year, until then every kind of alcohol was legal at age 16 in Lower Austria, Burgenland and Vienna
I think now it is the same in all states
It's not exactly a buying age
It's forbidden to "make alcohol available" to kids under the age
That includes buying/selling, but also gifting it
I don't know any parent that would let their 10 or even 12 year old have more than a few sips of alcohol
I think most will start drinking at 15 or 16
Liaben Gruaß aus Öberösterreich an den Nachbarn
In Austria, it's an "Ausschankverbot". Basically, adults are not allowed to give alcohol to people under the drinking age
They may not sell it to them neither gift it
Don't think so, under normal circumstances
We have five main parties:
ÖVP: The Austrian People's Party
Socially conservative and economically liberal
They also are the traditional voice of farmers and rural voters
It's the party of Chancellor Kurz
(last election: 37,5%, 71/183 seats)
SPÖ: The Social Democrats: Socially liberal and center-left economically
They are rather split on migration though
Half of the party take a progressive stance, the other half are more restrictive about it
(last election: 21,2%, 40/183)
FPÖ: our far-right, populist, anti-EU, anti-climate-action, anti-migration party
They have always been a cesspool of corruption and they fail to distance themselves from right-wing-extremist groups
They also have close ties to Putin's United Russia party
(last election: 16,2%, 31/183 seats, they kicked out one of their MPs at the start of the term
That MP is the wife of Mr
Ibiza, HC Strache
The Green Party: They are a center-left, progressive party with a focus on environmentalism
They are the junior coalition partner in government
(last election: 13,9%, 26/183 seats)
NEOS: They are a liberal center party
They and the Greens are the most pro-European parties in our political system
Their core issues are also transparency and anti-corruption
(Last election: 8,1%, 15/183 seats)
Our government is a turquoise-green coalition (ÖVP + Green Party)
They have a lot of differences but they still work rather well together
I'm glad that they are the ones managing the Corona crisis and not the previous ÖVP+FPÖ government
This coalition is, in my opinion, a good compromise between the conservative majority in the country and the more progressive parts of society
A list of all major parties from right to left:
FPÖ: "Liberal party austria" far right coservative party
ÖVP: "austrian peoples party" center right conservative party
SPÖ: "socialist party austria" center left party
Die grünen: "green party" left enviromental party
Neos: left liberal party
Bierpartei: "beer party" wants free beer for everyone and to stop people from working
I see you avoided the part where Sin Fein is elected (in Northern Ireland) but does not take their seats
To add to the confusion of the presidential role, let me mention that there is a chancellor of Switzerland
But it is not to be compared to the German one
They are just the head of some part of the federal administration, and while present at meetings of the federal council they have no vote
Yeah
I understood that
But I also felt that in the theme of OP's question, where they mention parties on the ballot vs in parliament, I thought it was an interesting point: being elected doesn't always mean sitting in parliament
My gym membership
Haven't been there since the birth of my daughter 3 years ago, but cancelling it *now* during Covid would feel mean
Thankfully it's dirt cheap
I also made a generous donation to Wikipedia because the last thing we need is them partnering with corporate or political sponsors
A few years ago I bought lots of *Schwedenbomben* sweets when the company was going bankrupt
I love the stuff, but OMG, the sugar
I have never heard of anyone who ordered pasta
Doesn't make any sense to me
Lots
Most are untranslatable
"Meinetwegen" is probably the most formal
Another option would be "wenn es sein muss" ("if it has to be so")
In local dialect we'd say "na wennst meinst", "von mir aus" or "wenn du des sagst". Those are more passive aggressive though
"Is a schen woam
" - "that's nice and warm too
" (A rather regional expression i guess)
"Passt scho
" - "that fits too
" (a *very* loose translation
i guess it's actually more along the lines of "whatever")
"Na dann
" - "well then"
"Scho recht
" s'ma wuarscht"
Waunst maanst
Eh woah
Jo eh
Scho, oba
In dialect, I'd just say "jo, eh" or even just "eh"
I also think that "Passt scho" is the most fitting phrase here
At least in Austria
German has naja, which Austrians pronounce as na jo
It means no but yes, essentially, is that the same for you
"fair enough" can have that passive-aggressive undertone as well
exactly the same here
exactly the same here
wow
very old-fashioned
Italy is a very very old-fashioned country
I come from an established, high middle-class Viennese family
There's a good chance I would have gone into administration or the army (and probably died in the Napoleonic Wars)
I would be a farmer in the Banat
My family descends from Danubian Swabians which were settled in the region by Maria Theresia
I'd probably be some rural bureaucrat, given my families background
Or if I go down the other side of the family, a farmer
I'd be a farmer
I grew up on a farm, so that's quite obvious
But since I'm now 20 I probably would've married  the son of an other farmer five years ago and would be pregnant with my third child
Dead too
And given all the other answers hre, it's visible well why people liked to have >10 kids
Increases the chance that 1-2 actually become adults
You would more likely be married off somewhere in the 22-27 range depending if your potential husband was able to establish his household
Late marriage was more or less considered family planning
Additionally if you weren‘t middle class, meaning your family didn’t have a lot of land or were merchants you wouldn‘t be married off for gain
There was no point
So you potentially have the option of marrying for love
I would too, and would most likely be called johann
Since my grandfather was a farmer called johann, his father was a farmer called johann, his father was a farmer called johann, ... that goes back 7 generations or so, and the head of my family moved not more then 50 km from the area we lived back then
And that move was only about 100 years ago
Glasses are a few hundred years older than you apparently think
>oh and having to listen to my patriotic dad bitching about getting poland back
Not much has changed, huh
How bourgeois
Depends how old you are
Marriage usually only happened when you were 27+ and could support your own household with a partner
So maybe you dont have to be constantly pregant before 27 ^^
>With the caveat that you'd probably have needed to have your future spouse be ok'ed by your parents
That was the norm back then
Makes sense too as families were much more of an economic unit back then
>But unless you have absolutely terrible taste in women/men, like falling in love with a Catholic girl, that usually wasn't a problem
Heretics can always reconvert
>By the way, early marriage, as in late teens and early twenties, did happen quite a bit, but generally only in the case of an unplanned pregnancy
Yeah, that too and not just in Calvinist Holland
There is the saying that the first child takes variable time while the second one always takes nine months
The standard of living was way better in the Middle ages, especially after the Black Death, when compared to the industrial revolution
Wages were way better and the peasants had more land available
Seems to be a theme in Catholic countries
Have some fun but be prepared to take responsibility
Additionally the child is not a bastard as long as it is born after the wedding
*taps forehead*
We shouldn't extend our dependence on the CCP any longer
Move vital industries back to Europe and recognize the RoC
We have the "Christkind" (basically baby Jesus) instead of Santa Claus
Saint Nikolaus traditionally "visits" on 6th December
He lived in Turkey in the 4th century
Is baby jesus a blonde girl angel in Slovakia like he is in Austria
There's a reason it's Baby Jesus
No holes yet, just an angelic smile and blonde locks
You get "real" gifts for Nikolaus
My kid gets tangerines, nuts, and chocolate
It's an angelic looking toddler actually
Often looks like a girl, but it's supposed to be kind of genderless
Not jesus christ, just baby jesus who brings the presents
Oh, they don't come down the chimney, they are described as kind of flying around outside and dropping things off under the christmas tree on christmas eve, through the window I guess
Awww :)
But I still fill my kid's Adventkalender each day, so there's that ;)
Oh no, the picture is just comparing Father Christmas to the Christkind, it's usually either or, never both together
A better translation would be the christ child, but baby jesus sounds cuter/more absurd
Hahaha, wait till you hear about St
Nikolaus and his sidekick, the evil Krampus
Sometimes :P Not always
But it's always our fault
I was working as a ski instructor and once a German tourist asked me if we wear normal clothes as well in our freetime
I asked him what he meant and he said he thought that we always wear our local costume which looks like [this ]
Edit: If anyone’s wondering the region is the Zillertal
The costumes only look like that inside the valley
Otoh we do wear a lot of Tracht and Loden - Trachtenmode has even made a huge comeback over the last years
> That Leprechauns are like Irish pygmies IE a seperate ethnicity to other Irish people
That is kind of a hilarious thought though
Now I'm sad that this isn't true
> that we have no cities
I mean
Dublin is more like a long-stretched village than a city :P
But less comfy, and much much more expensive, and harder to fix
There are some places where Sunday is the day everyone wears it
My region however is not like this
Sadly
Of course it has
But this guy thought those clothes are all we have
I think certain groups of the Roma people do that in the Balkans (certainly not all Roma)
I think I saw something about that on Vice once
Chippies will generally fry about anything you bring to them as far as I know
I doubt anyone will be able to beat Paris Airport who [had to shut down due to their Windows 3

While not really beeing about technlogy, a citiy level politician of the right wing-party FPÖ was interviewed about climate change
She referred to CO2 emissions to beeing as high as "38 Gigabytes per year".
And she didn't misspeak either, she kept talking about gigabytes of CO2, presumeably instead of gigatones
Vienna wanted to switch the administration to Linux, even developed there own distro [Wienux] for this purpose
It was in the middle of the migration when it officially given up because a software used in the Kindergartens did not run on the distro and then all PCs already ran on it were replaced with new PCs wits Windows Vista for 125
000€
Oh I got another one, worked for a company in the defence industry as a software development intern (must have been in 2010 or so)
The actual development machines were airgapped
USB sticks were of course strictly forbidden but of course everyone used them because you have to transfer libraries and updates _somehow_. Would have been fun to dump a few infected sticks in the parking lot
Machines were running XP of course (not even sure if they had the latest SP installed, but doubt it)
For the single machine in the lab that actually was allowed an internet connection (and of course strictly forbidden to code on) mandated the use of Windows XP and IE 6 with the argument that their firewall is responsible for blocking all the evil things anyhow
I did not try to prove them wrong but I doubt it would have been too hard
In Austria there is a law allowing you to make copies for example of music CDs for your personal usage, e.g. a safety copy
Some years ago they decided that in order for the law applying to you you have to pay a fee (this is the most fucked up legal thing ever, you shouldn't need to pay a fee for a law to work)
So pay the fee, be allowed to make such copies
Now a reasonable person would say if I buy a music CD I pay a bit more and that is to cover that
But those idiots decided that you don't have to pay when buying the music, or the book or whatever, you have to pay when buying (empty) storage
They did a study and came up with a ridiculous number of files that are apparently saved on every storage so now you have to pay some extra euros when buying empty CDs, SD cards, PCs with internal hard drives, hard drives, a smart watch,... and that money goes to artists without them providing anything to the people who pay that stupid fee
Now obviously there is usage of storage where you don't store any of such copies
So you can, if you convince them that you aren't using it for that, get your money back
But those assholes admitted that if you apply for it as a citizen and not a company they will automatically reject it
It's sad but that's reality
I'd love to see either everything completely up-to-date or even that fever dream of running only FOSS in public institutions but in so many cases it's just not very realistic
tbf shes also a city-renowned alcoholic
I don't think windows update was a thing until XP

You got it
I don"t sell swimming pools but my landlord keeps sending me pages files (I'm on windows) and corrupted PDFs
When I send pdfs back they claimed several times that they cannot open it
Sending the same files again apparently fixed it
The word "doch". It can be used in a various of different contexts and is amplifying the speakers point
It is one of the most defiant words I know and is often used by fighting kids
Some examples:
This is my game
- I played with it first
- Give it back
- No
- Doch
Das ist doch Susan
- It's Susan
(in a surprised way)
Du bist doch schon gegangen
- I thought you already left
Also doch
- (I suspected something and it's now proven)
Ich bin doch noch hier
- I am still here (and changed my mind about leaving)
"Doch" in English
Would make my everyday life much easier
„sich ausgehen“ as in „etw
geht sich (nicht) aus“
This is only used in Austria as far as I know, not Germany
It comes in quite handy in everyday conversations
On the one hand, it can mean that there is (not) enough time, but it can also mean there is (not) enough space, or something doesn’t fit
Say the elevator is full for example, you can say „Das geht sich nicht mehr aus, I’ll take the stairs
“ or „my suitcase is not as full as yours, bei mir geht sich noch was aus
More often, it is used in the sense that there is or isn’t enough time to do something
Ex: „The store closes at 6pm, das geht sich jetzt nicht mehr aus“ or „das geht sich noch aus“.
There is a third meaning that is implied as well
When someone treats you poorly, for example in a relationship, you can say „es geht sich nicht aus“ emotionally
„I put in so much effort and get nothing in return
Das geht sich einfach nicht aus
“ (this might be a Viennese thing, I don’t know about other regions)
as a Viennese I gotta say „Oida“! It‘s basically Viennese in a nutshell and is exclusive to Vienna and maybe the sorrounding areas
It‘s derived from „Alter“ which means roughly „dude“.
Now, the beauty of it is that we use it in many contexts and only this one word is suffice to convene so many different layers/emotions, only depending on how you say it
[There is also a video about it, and the person who made it can currently be seen in a campaign against covid, produced by the city
Tja
machste nix
mal, leicht, gar, denn, ...
helped me a lot when learning Japanese, and equating some of their own modifier words with ours
English natives struggled, but for the German-speakers it was just a simple matter of "ah, so 'no desu' is just like asking a question with 'denn' vs
without (Wohin gehst du/Wohin gehst du denn), perfectly clear".
Übersichtlich can be used in so many ways too
From "your storage organization is very neat and easy to understand" to ironically using it like "Die Auswahl in dem Geschäft war doch eher übersichtlich" - "the assortment in that store was rather small".
I nominate Vormittag
Same situation, existed as forenoon, not common anymore though
I always trip up when I want to talk about the time between maybe 9-10 and 12 in a work setting, no it's not morning anymore dammit, it's already Vormittag
I also love regional eccentricities like *epa* and *sochn*, which i have no translation for whatsoever
I think that's one of the reasons my language when speaking English is littered with modifiers like "pretty", "quite", "rather", "fairly", "more" etc
which are rather frowned upon in "good writing" circles
You do however have a word for the solution to Wackelkontakt, which i envy you for: percussive maintenance
I nominate Kreislaufproblem
Health problem with your circulation, that can mean blood pressure, blood sugar, slight fever, or any other ailment really
So simple
I find that 'to indulge in sth' comes pretty close
Well I wouldn't. Maybe it's a regional thing
Now that you mention it, we have kinda the same problem with ärgern in German
Sure, *irritate* works, but that's pretty close to the word "irritieren", which has another meaning alltogether
Probably because most people still grew up with some post WW2 anti-german propaganda (which was justified back in the 1940s, but come on
Also, especially in Hollywood movies, villains tend to still mostly be German/Russian/British, so that stereotype is still around
[r/Austria insider]
The Flak towers of Vienna are the most ugly buildings, but they were never build to be beautiful
nah, Flak towers are awesome in a brutalist kind of way
especially in Vienna's conservative cityscape, they are so bold that it's really exciting
The Dancing House is cool
Gotta visit it next time I'm in Prague
Honestly I only find the TH Nürnburg ugly from those
And the church but it's really cool inside
Who is doing that
The FLNC
It looks like a cache pot for 15€ in IKEA
Well, at least they are not ugly and made of wood
[We've got a similar tower]
It's just the colour, reimagine it it would have a red brick front and then it's good
Fronte National Liberation Corse (don't know about the spelling, but you get the idea)
A separatist extremist organization
Kinda like IRA or ETA, but Corsican
Fyi, Spain is about the size of Texas and there's beautiful places everywhere, and you can do anything from a beach holiday, over hiking, cultural city trips, or even skiing in winter (a little bit at least)
Also, the climate between the sunny Mediterranean Coast, the dry semi-arid interior, and the lush, rainy and mountainous North varies greatly
So plan your trip well, and have fun
Yes, we have a contract with the holy see that guarantees it
Yes, it's an law from 1949 that a child of one of the official acknowledged religion has the right to get teached of their religion in school
The reason of this law was afaik a Concordat with the Catholic church which grands them to teach children the religion in school
Yes, we've religion as a subject in every year
It's specifically Catholic religion too
If you're not Catholic you don't have to be there
However, even as an atheist(not on paper though) I have had mostly good experience with those lessons because I've always had good teachers
They invited people from other regions to talk about theirs, they told us about our religions history etc
It wasn't mindless bible reading or singing religious songs or anything like that
Yes and there is a separate one for each religious group
So you have catholic, calvinist, lutheran as well as jewish, sunni, alavit gettimg their own teachers
Reason is a concordat treaty between the Vatican and Austria that grants the catholic chur h the privilege to teach at public schools
And because all religions are treated equal, this right is also grantef to all other recognized religions as well
interesting, this is *exactly* how it is here, down to all your points of criticism
me personally I had some great religion classes (like a homeroom class, doing stuff to build a harmonious class community) and some not so great ones (teacher came in and put a TV there and turned on a movie, often didn't show up at all), it really depended on the teacher
any kind fo reform so far failed because of an overwhelming feeling of "but that's how we've always done it".
Sounds a lot like the situation in Austria, except that it's 2 hours per week and any students, not just Catholics, are entitled to lessons in their own religions
You can opt out of course
Tell him we are all nudists
So i gave it a thought and my best idea is this: Tell him that Europeans are really freaked out by Americans because they tend to look Europeans waaay longer into their eyes than theyre used to do it and he should be really careful about this not to put people off, because it comes across as rather aggressive here
Tell him in Germany you have to clap 3 times when you fart
Say it has something to do with the gas attacks in WW1
Tell him the Dutch are big fans of Trump, really big fans
It's true
That's the reason why the national color is the color of Trumps skin
America first, but Netherland second
Tell him that toilets in Germany are not separated by gender
Tell him germans like to hear compliments about politicians
The current greatest revolutionist is Martin Sonneborn
If you wants to break ice with germans, praise Sonneborn
Actually he is more like a comedian, who is voted in the EU Parlament and doing funny stuff
Not gonna lie, that's kinda genius
The second one is great
Americans are stereotypically portrayed to be terribly scared of nudity
You're allowed to wear Speedos in Finland
I mean, I guess with the freezing cold and all that, but I can't imagine wearing that much clothes around here
This is actually also impolite in Austria
No, not at all :)
You are supposed to make eye contact while you are saying "Cheers" (or whatever)
Ah, okay, thats pretty weird - youre right
Most Likely [Dornbirn]
It's hard to choose if you have 1 city and else only villages of various sizes
So we would probably just annex czechia or bavaria and use prag/munich instead
(One of those two would probably be very happy about this solution)
Sydney just for confusion
It's not an capital but if we exchange it it will be one
And it would be in Austria and not Australia
So people get confused
It was conected by a tram line so its esentially one city anyway
Twin-city, oida
I second this because of the Brno racetrack, a great circuit
Quiet, Swiss backyard boy
Salzburg or Graz sound like a good choice that actually makes sense
Soon with the power of sect and urban planning Vienna will swallow Pressburg and Slovakia as a whole
Yeah lets take a handful of nations and unite them under one flag, but since i am austrian i can tell you that this empire isn't allowed to be ruled by just one nationality so we give every annexed nation seats in a shared government and make it more of a loose union
I hope the name european union isn't used anywhere since that would be the best name for something like that
I'm pretty sure a lot of brits would be happy to join for some more stability since that weird brexit thing threw everything into chaos over there
Hm this seems familiar somehow, I don't really know why though
Correct me if I‘m wrong:
During the times where Habsburg reigned, Prague was actually the most important city, followed by Vienna
The Habsburger wanted to keep on building up Viennas infrastructure because it was one of the most important cities in the Middle of Europe, _because of_ it‘s Geography
Between mountains with very important  trade routs going through it + the Donau going quite literally through Vienna
Only because the Kingdom Austria was formed Vienna became suddenly capital, I‘ll take a wild guess and say because it was the most important city that still belonged to our land
It was right away taken by Napoleon two times btw
So we should send a politition to germany again
We have a handfull of ~~nsdap~~ fpö members who could do the job
Austriae est imperare orbi universo
We Austrians tend to take us way too serious
Glorious days of Kuk monarchy are over, although I have the impression that Austria is still a link between the eastern , the southern and western Europe, economicly and cultural
Vienna also has one of two UN centers (one in New York)
We are a neutral country and therefore contribute to negotiations especially in the Balkans
Nowadays Austria plays a role in the migration politics of the EU with the well known "Balkan route".
I guess our geographic position between Germany and Italy does make us kinda valuable
There's a reason most of the traffic isn't going through Switzerland
Also we're one of the paying countries rather than the receiving countries
Other than that i guess we're rather one of the "good to haves" than the essentials
Although our chancellor tries hard to become the "friendly critical alternative" to the EU criticism of the (alt-)right and Orban
you have the best female bouldering competitor though
mad respect
I feel like if we tried annexing and stirred things up a bit (near the Balkan of all places), people would be very alert indeed
Wow, never heard about the frugal four
You forgot about the beer
Wait, Slovenia isn't a part of Czechoslovakia
Bit bold to assume that Greek people forgot about their ancient history and not just didn't bring it up in this thread about modern Greece because it's just not relevant at all
don't forget Malta :(
We have a conservative government that likes to oppose big state spending
So they teamed up with three other "frugal" governments to fight the big spending plans of the EU commission
Two other factors:
* Austria pays a lot of money to the commission
There have been studies saying that if you count all business etc that we make because of the EU, we still profit - but if you just count "how much money we pay to the institutions and how much money they invest into Austrian", we're losing money
Since the UK left we now have to pay even more
Do our chancellor was like "we won't double our payments, forget that"
* The Conservatives like to use xenophobia
Protesting against  financial help for southern eu countries helps in this regard to secure votes
Hungry
Aren't there enough Kangaroos to eat
Public health care requires a public health care agency
Whenever there is a public agency it might get complicated
Like wasting taxpayers money, pulitical influence, political parties and all the other typical issues we know
Here it's an public insurance which is mandatory and you can get additional insurances
The mandatory one covers basically all you need(Well dental Work is Not that good covered) and the additional provide more comfort (e.g. a 2 bed Room in Hospital instead a 4-6)
The downsite I See ist there a doctors, who choose to not fully corporate with the insurances, which results essentially in a "2 class health Care". like He is more expensive than their tarife, so you pay him fully and the insurance pays you their tarife back
It's not that bad as you are taken good care Off in the basic insurance, but still there is the posibillity to Cut waiting time for non life threatening issues when you go to a doctor the working men could not afford
I guess some See this even as plus
According to surgery we also have long waiting times
I had a "surgery" on my ear years ago and had to wait half a year back then
But I could leave the hospital on the same day since it wasn't too big of a surgery and I felt well (despite beeing exhausted)
My grandmother also had to wait for her knee and feet surgery
She stayed a night there but my sister and I brought her home the following day since she would've gotten thrown out anyway
Plus: You don't have to pay for a surgery most of the times and you don't have to pay to visit a doctor
Tho you have to buy your own medicine
And some surgeries aren't free (I had a tooth surgery
It took over years since it had to be done step by step
One of the worst things
I had to pay for that
Thanks to an incompetent dentist I had to go through this)
I don't see this as a downside
I know of someone who wouldn't have been near able to get a surgery because they earned basically no money
I think that paying taxes for Healthcare is the best solution to that problem
Well, the "Proporz" is really a very typical Austrian thing
Social insurances (GKK, SVA etc
) all have their political color here and the bosses of the individual branches always had to be affiliated with a certain political party (SPÖ or ÖVP)
BUT, I think our health system still is working very well besides these issues
Could it be more efficient
Well of course, as every system could be
But it still has an extremly high standard of quality and generally you will get a good treatment when you are sick
Building hospitals goes hand in hand with bribery and a political scandal here, just saying
It has, however op asked about downsides
I could image this being less existent in privately run hospitals
Might other things be going in, but here we have the administration being involved in bribery
Which is a different issue as it is taxpayer's money
Well theres also the issue of severly underpaid civil service labor keeping services afloat
I'd say that is otr very well could have been an emergency
I guess whats meant are people clogging up the ER when they just have a cold or other minor problem that could be easily solved by the family doctor
I cut off the tip of my thumb a few months ago
Disinfected it myself, stopped the bleeding and bandaged it
Got a tetanus shot the next day from my the local doc and a better bandage
No need to clog up the ER and endanger others who think they might have a heart attack
Same here in Austria, but for a US citizen like OP it's all the same, "taxes".
Don't you dare to tell me that the "Energyring" for the mere 95k€ around the new hospital doesn't do its job
Bribery also exists in privately run environments
Just as much as everywhere else where money is involved
But you are right, the difference is the taxpayer's money
I know
But I tried to explain the difference to my American relatives and in the end they said "OK so taxes
All the scandinavian languages
I know that "nokken in the kokken" is "fucking in the kitchen" in swedish
And that's all
The rest is just confusing

Austro-Fascism
We had our own fasicst dictator called Dollfuß in Austria between the two World Wars
There are many people in Austria who don't know much about this time
The interwar periode
Just watching an Austrian documentation about what was going in just in Austria, in that was insanly much and many things Not covered in History lessons
I don't know anything about the Yugoslav wars although this happened only 20 years ago
I don't know why it started, I don't know who won or why it ended and I don't know which countries were involved
Everything up north or down south
The Roman Empire, Habsburg Empire and all those Empires is about the most we learn about countries that didn‘t do something globally that affected us or are neighboring us
Austria:
my high school started at 7:25 with 50min lessons
No breaks between lessons except 15min break between 3-4 no breaks after that
10mins between 6-7
If i head more than 7 lessons either 6th or 7th was free
10min break between 8-9
3 times a week 10 lessons a day, one day 8 and one 6or7
Trip to school was about 1h.
Left for school at 06:10 and came home (10hday) at 17:30
The first military operation in both World Wars got commanded by an Austrian born guy
Wouldn't it also be the most Belgian thing if they fail to name someone to be the spokesperson of the group and keep on reelecting and yet just don't find someone to do the job
Austria - Tirol
Not the whole country, but the day of the "Blochziehen" is THE day of the year when it happens (only every 4 years) and villages have their own schedules and not many villages do it
Its a pre-christian tradition whrere a huge tree is pulled trough the village on sleds by masked adults
All masked people signify something: the rooster - fertility (if he jumps you it means you'll marry soon), the couple - marriage (they fight a lot, lol), the moss-man - the woods, the bear - hunting
and a lot of traditional professions are there too
Certain people are meant to catch the bear and moss-man and the tree can only go further when they are caught
It means taming nature to stop the winter and start spring
There are several stops and a large stop at the end
At each stop there are food stands and of course small wooden bars
At the last stop the tree is sold in an auction which pays for everything (buying it is more an act of philanthropy as the tree has to be prepped for being pulled and is basically very expensive firewood)
The party afterwards is the stuff of legends
But even better is the after-afterparty a month or so later when everything has been cleaned up
You see, the Blochziehen is a village affair
**Everybody** volunteers working for it
From the richest go the poorest people in town
And as a thank you, you get invited to that party
Drinks and food are covered
It always goes well into the morning and sometimes continues after that at some friends place for breakfast
It will be the talk of town for 4 years until the next Blochziehen comes along
That’s December 5 though
December 24th
December 25th is considered a holiday bur we don‘t do anything on it
It‘s just a holiday
24th on the evening, Christmas dinner ([noodle soup with Frankfurter] and the meat that was used for the soup afterwards, together with close family, parents, grandparents (sometimes close neighbours)
25th is mostly meeting with extended family, aunties, uncles, cousins and so on
If you´d ask me I´d say no, but my intuition has been right quite a few times when travelling abroad and unknowingly having them around me (before hearing them talk of course, which confirmed my assumptions)
I really do not know why, though
I don't feel like there are any specialities genetically or fashion-wise
How about [him]
In my opinion this could be a north sea sailor selling me the best fish in the world with extra omega-3 on TV
looks very weak indeed hope he got better after this photo
ps I still would love to see the pic of a stereotypical iranian :D
I've found that portuguese people often have these dark areas around their eyes, making them look a bit tired/older than they actually are
not a bad thing at all, just something I noticed
is it genetic, a certain style of makeup, or something stemming from windy/sunny climate
You are right but obviously it's about "the most polish" polish person
So obviously black people for examples wouldn't fit that description because most people in poland are white
It's about the commen denominator in the structure of faces
Belgium is unique of course becuase of the Flemmings and Walloons thing
You mean, you are good at distinguishing between these countries, or you could just tell that someone is from *one of* these countries
Don't forget the all-weather jacket
You never know
sounds all very reasonable tbh
wish I was like that, I never plan that far in advance; but especially things like using enough (=more than you think you should) sun screen is just super sensible and will hopefully protect you from skin damage once you're older
The hotspot is Vienna's center of course
But I am sure some skiing areas (like Ischgl) are in the winter season very crowded by tourists too
Of course Vienna, but that’s more in total numbers, not in relation to size
The county of Tyrol is very touristic, the valley where I live, the Zillertal (Zillervalley) alone had 4,5 million nights spend in winter 2015/2016
I woud say it isn't just or skiing areas but most and definitely all the bigger ones
In my opinion everything in Austria is very nice haha
I know all of them if someone talks about them, but can recite maybe 25 from memory, maybe 40 if I really think about it for a while
All of them
Not a chance
We had to learn them in school, like a lot of other stuff, but honestly, the only reason I remember them is A) movies and TV shows (e.g. Minnesota is where Jack O'Neill from Stargate grew up) and B) because no person from the US I've ever met or talked to has ever just said that they are from the US, they always mention the state, often including the city
If it is a large city they sometimes may mention *only* that
By name, I know (all) 50 states
By location, I tried recently and I got like 10-15
And I *think* I know four capitals
New York - Albany, California - Sacramento, Texas - Houston (???), Washington - Washington DC
Still not sure wether or not Floridas capital is Miami
And I think even people who don‘t know anything about the US and can‘t even speak english can point out the bigger states
At least my dad knows states like California, Washington, New York, Minnesota, Florida, and so on
I assume almost no one could list all of them but at least the more educated people would definitely know that these are states in the US
Don't forget, size-wise it's more like me saying "I'm from Austria, it's a country in Europe". If you tell me that you are from Crook County I also wouldn't have any idea that that's in Wyoming or even in the US
Good guess
It's in the South East right next to France
Dover is in Kent
I only know Kent from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, it was pronounced Cænt the time the game takes place
> If it is a large city they sometimes may mention only that
The only one I've never heard was "New York, New York".
> People really know next to nothing about Wyoming Delaware or Nebraska
Well, the question is: would they know those are US states
Well, its easy
Vienna is the Capital of Vienna, and Salzburg is the Capital of Salzburg :P

Hebrew - it’s a lot of fun to learn but at the same time a lot harder for me than the other languages I’ve learned because of the script and the fact that the vowels are not written, plus tons of prefixes and suffixes for prepositions, tenses and such
Wouldn't have it any other way
Absolutely
Fuck yeah
On the other hand - we now have the option to say on a Friday afternoon "I have nothing to do this weekend, fuck it I'm going to see Warsaw" without any kind of planning
Buy a train ticket, look for a hotel/AirBNB while sitting in the train
I can only recommend spontaneous trips like that
You must promise to to tell anyone but [^^birds ^^aren't ^^real]
E: not it's the proper phrase
Esotericism or whatever its called and homeopathy, especially in rural regions
Also  astrology
Heck, on the biggest radio station in the country there is a horoscope every day
And there's something similar to the Reichsbürger, but in Austria it's not common at all
But they also believe that Austria somehow is a fake state and in reality it's still the first republic or the empire, but I don't really know much about that
Chemtrails are pretty popular
Then there's the theory that Jörg Haider didn't die in a drunk driving accident, but it was a conspiracy by Mossad/CIA/German BND/George Soros/(((the Jews)))
There's also A LOT of people who believe HC Strache and Gudenus were not drunk in the Ibiza video, but they were drugged and somehow led to say all those things, totally not their fault
Whose fault is it you ask
Of course Mossad/George Soros/(((the Jews)))
Didn't help that Strache's wife and Gudenus himself kinda implied so themselves
So like the india superpower by 2020 meme
Birds are government surveillance drones
They were all replaced in the 50s.
"birds aren't real" is a general meme that I think comes out of the hacker community
No (yes)
Yeah, sure, shill
The claim is that there was never a peace treaty after WW2 or something so the whole construct of post-ww2 republics does not exist and such
Weird ppl
Clearly that was a hostile takeover of the Deutsche demokratische Genossenschaft by the Bundesrepublik GmbH
The way I know the conspiracy theory, there was no treaty in either side of Germany
But honestly I don't care enough about the Germans to actually research it
Also m2c it's completely irrelevant because a state is defined through recognition both internationally and within its population (as well as the ability to enforce its statehood and laws), so it's completely irrelevant if there is a contract or not
That's exactly what a government bot would say, don't trust his words
That's what she told you
Not German, but I think so can still answer in the spirit of the question
Yea, one did serve in WW2, I sadly don't know exactly where, and why (if he volunteered or got drafted)
Anyway, he got injured by a grenade fragment in his right knee which gave him an out and made him unable to return into service until the end of the war, which was his luck I guess
Afaik it didn't much affect him in the rest of his life
Also he never talked about his time in the Wehrmacht at all with me or my dad, so that's all I know
My great-grandfather was drafted and stationed somewhere in Yugoslavia
He had a few encounters with partisans, luckily he was wounded sometimes, I don't know why and how but because of that he couldn't serve anymore
I don't really know much about him since I never met him
My grandfathers both were born during WW2 so they weren't old enough to serve
I don't really know about my other great-grandparents
Neither of them talked about it and died before I got curious
I guess there is the unspoken rule of don't ask, don't tell about this topic in Austria
One Grandpa worked at a flight field near Graz as electrician
The other one I've found mainly pics from his company in front of train wagons
One great grandfather got wounded in Stalingrad and flown out with the last plane before it all went down
His two younger brothers had just minor injuries so they had to stay in Stalingrad
He never heard of them again
(Rumor has it that he had sympathy for the nazis first)
The other great grandfather was sent to Ukraine
His sick wife was left behind and had to do all the hard farm work on her own
She died when my grandma was 8 of exhaustion
(Was always a unpolitical man and hated the nazis from the beginning)
Aaand another great grandfather was also sent to the eastern front and became a russian war prisoner for 10 years
When he returned home he had just 46kg despite being 1,90 tall and his kids didn’t know him
(I guess he was a bit fond of Hitler in the beginning hence they were from the same town and he named my Grandpa Adolf, but never wanted to talk about it after war)
Not german, but I had 2 grandfathers drafted into the german army
One was drafted near the end of the war and was then killed by a soviet grenade near Vienna
The other one was drafted in 1941 and was then captured by the soviets and spent many years in a Gulag
Gladly he made it home pretty much unhurt and lived a great life until 1989
I never knew him personally, but there are tapes of him telling stories from the war
Neither of my two grandparents did much during the war
One was way too young, since he was born in 1937
All I know about him is that his dad (my great grandfather), who was a fanatic Nazi, planned to make him attend some kind of Hitler youth school
The other one apparently hid himself in the woods or something to avoid getting drafted
(I don't really know much about him because he died in the 60s)
Only the two brothers of my granny actually fought in WW2
One was at the western front and later POW under the British
Now her second brother probably had it the worst of them all
He was drafted into the Wehrmacht when he was 18 and directly sent to good old Stalingrad
During the battle he almost died due to a grenade (there is still a splinter of it in his body) and later on he obviously was a POW in the Soviet Union
I am amazed that despite living through hell for a few years, he's still going strong with 95 years
Austrian here
One of my great-grandfathers was on the battlefield somewhere in Croatia on the nazi side
As I heard, he looked eye to eye at an Croatian soldier
Both had rifles in their hand
Both didnt shoot
Both turned around and ran away
I'm not sure how true this story is
I think its pretty true because everything else I know about this particular great-grandfather is not that nice (he cheated, was abusive to his son, ...) so I think this story is true even though it's kinda hard to believe
Not German but close enough
Two of my great-grandparents served in the war
The one on my mothers-side was in the SS, don't know how he survived
I was told that he was a horrible man and did awful thing in the name of the third reich
He always said that he was only following the masses but that was a flat out lie
Talking about him is kind of a taboo topic in the family but sometime they talk about him a little
When we cleaned out his old house we found several letters and a nazi flag
On my fathers-side my great-grandpa was only in the Wehrmacht
He was in some of the worse battles on the eastern front and he fought in Stalingrad
He survived and was captured as a POW and sent of to Siberia (not entirely sure) but he later came home all the way by foot
From what I heard he was a relatively good man, altough you never know what he did on the eastern front
If you have any questions, please ask them, I will try to answer them as good as possible
Not my dad, but I work in a care home for senior citizens in Austria and one of my clients told me his story
He was drafted age 17 in 1942
He had to leave his hometown in southern Austria and travel all the way up to the North sea, where he was trained to become a tank driver
He fought on the Western front after the D-Day invasion
During the Battle of the Bulge, his small tank was hit by an allied anti tank
His friend and commander died on impact
Over the radio he was ordered to continue the assault, now alone in his tank with this dead buddy in the same compartment
He lost his will to fight at that point (if he ever head any) but he was afraid of repercussions if he retreated
So he turned the gun of the tank upwards to the back of the vehicle and slowly drove towards the enemy, white napkin hanging out of the hatch
After being surrounded by a British unit he surrendered and became a POW
He spent about a year in a camp in Belgium where he had to dismantle military vehicles
After that, he was later transferred to a camp in France where he stayed until some time 1946, when he returned home to Austria
Not a German, but an Austrian
My grand father served from 1939 to 1945 where he was imprisoned somewhere in Siberia
He was really lucky though as he got released in autumn 1945 without any organs or kneecaps taken away from him
He died long before I was born but according to my father, he didn't want to talk a lot about the war
There is only one situation during the German-Soviet war he talked about once, the one where they were surrounded and forced to surrender
A few years after my grand father returned home, a bullet fraction was removed from his arm
I just know that one hreat-grandfather served and died in an US prisoner camp
Not German, but my grand-father was drafted and had to serve in Crimea
He almost died in the [Crimean Offensive] but he was sent back early to Germany because he had to train new soldiers on how to use a Granatwerfer 34
He almost ended up in a POW camp near Cologne - but since he was originally from a farm he was sent to work on a farm with 4 or 5 other POWs, which was pretty "good" compared to the regular POWs in camps
Not German, but my grandfather had an interesting story
He was an orphan and volunteered for the paratroopers (Fallschirmjäger) in 1940, when he was 17 years old
I'm not sure what he did in the early years of the war, but in 1943 he participated in the Gran Sasso Raid, also called Operation Oak
In this raid German paratroopers freed Benito Mussolini from captivity
Later, in 1944, he was stationed near Normandy (I'm not sure exactly where, sadly
) Shortly after the Allied landing, he deserted and was taken in by a French family
He stayed with them for a couple years (even after the war had ended) and visited them again decades later
I also remember my parents gifting him a flight with an old Ju 52 (the plane he jumped out of as a paratrooper) for his birthday at some point
I know the story of two of my great-grandfathers as well, but they aren't quite as interesting as his, just sad really
EDIT: Something I forgot to mention, he did get the Iron Cross during the war
I'm not sure but I think he may have gotten it for his actions during the Gran Sasso Raid
On my mothers side: great-grandfather was a master carpenter and served in a pioneer regiment
Somehow he became a POW in Switzerland at the end of the war
On my fathers side: my grandfather never talked about it, but it was an open secret that he had been a SS officer
>I always thought that story was impressive, but your relative's sounds moreso
either way, it's insane the degree to which war and devestation can push people
My uncles father walked home from Stalingrad
It's unimaginable for me
Yea, it's a really interesting thing tbh
I would have loved to talk about it with my grandfather, but he passed when I was still in primary school so I could never really talk to him about it
No, he is my half-uncle
One of his fathers is my grandpa but the other one isn't.
Well the German Wikipedia is the 2nd biggest (if you exclude the Swedish and Cebuano one, which are mostly bot generated) after the English one
For some regional stuff, or local celebrities it's better than the English one
I don't use it for much else
It's pretty decent but the community ist pretty akward
I added much pics, mostly self taken of geographic or achictecture content, but I stoped ages ago
Also my account was suspended, idk why, all I'ce done is adding m own pics under a CC license and asked in the discussion pages If there is more Proof to Things I've found online to some topics
The German wikipedia has been the second most comprehensive after the English one for quite a while (don't know if this is still the case tho), so I used whichever happens to have the more detailed article
Sometimes I use both
Sometimes I use the English one as a dictionary for technical/professional terminology
I look up the German term and switch to the English article
Interestingly, in scientific topics the German wiki is sometimes even better, more extensive, or at least has different information compared to the English one
But I usually use the English one
My first search for generic topics is always in English, the German one I only use only for specific local things
And even then, it’s most likely so specificly German that it doesn’t apply to Austria
And Germans gatekeep the German Wiki pretty well, so sometimes a more generic Google search yields better results
German Wikipedia:
&#x200B;
Controversial topics, eg
politics, corruption cases, war histories, etc
etc
As with many Wiki languages, the whole Internet, and all other media, you'll find plenty of bias and lies
Never rely on a single source
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Admins: "Some" people say that German Wiki admins extensively delete everything that doesn't fit their personal opinion
(I'm not giving any statement if this is true or not)
&#x200B;
Country-specific things, eg laws, taxes, government agencies etc
As German is the main language in several countries, sometimes articles have subsections for Germany, Austria, etc
But other times, it describes just one country, and neither from the structure nor the text details it is visible which one
Requiring other sites than Wikipedia, to check which country this applies to, is bothersome
Of course, in principle the same problem exists in English Wikipedia, but at least I have the impression it's much more clear there
I don't have to guess of some information is meant for UK only, another country, or worldwide
&#x200B;
Science problem 1: Link forest
If you want to find a quick overview about what an ABC (placeholder) is, relatively often you'll find descriptions like "An ABC is if combine \[link to DEF\] and \[link to GHI\] and \[link to JKL\] and \[link to MNO\], and DEF/GHI/JKL/MNO are not basic knowledge but equally complicated
So if you don't know ABC yet it's unlikely that you know these other things and first need to learn about these (and they again have links to other topics)
&#x200B;
Science problem 2: Malicious textbook authors
For topics that are usually taught in university courses and schools, sometimes (often
) Wikipedia articles are written by people who also made books targetted at students
If you buy the book, you'll find an easily understandable 3-line description there
At the same time Wikipedia has two pages of complicated text that contains plenty of unnecessary steps etc
, to "punish" people who didn't buy their book
Only after spending hours to understand the article, you'll realize that 90% was useless
&#x200B;
Other than these big problems, articles can be quite useful
The best and worst thing about German Wikipedia is the high quality control
Articles are very neutral, comprehensive and nearly all information is backed by external sources
But that only works because changes are not published until they are through a quality control
I have published for english, italian, french, spanish, polish and danish Wikipedia and everywhere my changes were live immediately
In German Wikipedia you need 200 approved changes, before you can publish changes immediately
For beginners it is very frustrating sometimes, because your changes are often rejected for formal reasons
And German Wikipedians love to discuss and preach their holy rules
Yea, according to [Wikipedia] its 99% bot generated
That's amazing
German makes sense since German speaking Europe had the second largest internet presence after the anglosphere in the early days, but why Catalan
Was there an early wikipedia enthusiast from Catalonia
Our drinking water is so good, I've heard that some people bottle it up and sell it overseas
Like Voss, but probably less expensive
Sure
Viennas water is mostly mountain spring water
Couldn't get any better
Most of the country has the same quality, in some other areas it doesn't taste that great but most people still drink it
Also Voss sold in the US is actually bottled in the US, not in Norway
Also Vienna water is fucking cold
In the summer its the most refreshing drink you can get
It doesn't taste bad, it just tastes different
Like I prefer my hometown water to the water in the city I study, but it is still good
This is actually true for a lot of countries, not just scandinavia
Depends on how old you are, but as far as I can remember we always had great tap water
Here, they don’t even sell these 5l water jugs like they do in Spain and Italy
If it is from a public water network, it is normally perfectly clean
But in the countryside many people still have their own well
There the water is not always good
Before we were connected to public water, we also didn't drink the water from our well
The tap water in Austria is very hard (=has a lot of lime in it)
It is perfectly healthy and also contains important minerals
But some people think that it's unhealthy so this might be the reason
I have never seen anyone drinking sparkling water on a mountain
True
Thats what Vienna water is
During the time of the Austrian empire they built huge waterpipes from the alps straight into the city
LOL, I can guarantee then that it was not the tap water that made your brother sick
Must have been a coincidence
Or someone had some really badly maintained pipes
Berlin going strong as well
It's relaxing, isn't it
Bydgoszcz in Poland (German: Bromberg) for me
Never heard of it
After that I didn't know Plovdiv (BG), Bielefeld (I'm pretty sure they made that one up), and Craiova (RO)
I also came across a bunch of other Polish cities which I hadn't heard of (Szczecin, Poznań, Wrocław), but when I read the German names (Stettin, Posen, Breslau), I realized I *have* heard of them
Valenzia
And down from there all spanish cities
I‘m sorry, I‘m terrible at spanish geography
Poznań in Poland
Also don't know any details about Gothenburg in Sweden which is a few spots above it (bit it does sound familiar at least)
ooh it's one of those cities that are awesome to pronounce in an andalusian accent
zzzzz
> Iași
how about Jassenmarkt :)
Also, Zaragoza is the only city name in Spain, where every single vocal is stressed ;)
Wutsch, I knew it
Nah this is pronounced *Wutsch* (in German)
Build a solid foundation of standard German first then have lots of conversation to learn the dialect
Learn articles with the nouns
But don't stress out about them
Its pretty much a lifelong process to learn them
And be sure to ask to speak German if you ever want to train with native speakers
Because most will immediately jump to English if they're capable of it and notice you're a foreigner
Don't bother
lmao you can taste the irony
Excessive lighting is called "Festbeleuchtung" in my household (Festival lighting) but idk if it's austrian, my mom grew up in east germany
Not tidying your room: It looks like a pig's sty in here
Eastern Saxony it is
Since 1918 it is forbidden to use a title of nobility in Austria
Since then the fine of 20
000 Kronen (the currency back then) has never been increased
So it is only 14 cents now
So you can't call yourself like "King Michael VI
"? Or Duke Of Pöstlingbergbahn"? I hope I understood that right
how do you he is Scottish
We have the same in Austria
I never understood for what it is worth, but since our last Right-Right government I happily pay for it, because without it the public news media cannot be independent since it is not tax and goes directly to those institutions
They tried a lot to get rid of this system and to control the public media (ORF)
For example they wanted to get rid of Radio Ö1 which does a very good news coverage and educational program
But they failed due to popular support of the channel
There are many other countries who have this as well, Germany, France Japan come to mind
You can't change your name to that officially
If you want to use invented titles as a Nickname, I think there's no problem
Also foreign titles are allowed, when I'm not mistaking
As the law has never been reworked, it is not very detailed
It mainly says, there is no nobility anymore in Austria and no privilege of nobility
Even the Habsburg family is not allowed to call themselves "von Habsburg". However, the Dutch "van" is allowed
As a masochistic epileptic I think that's very discriminating
It depends - there are some clear rules how to write words on German and people sure would have a certain success rate in writing an unknown word correctly if they are already good at orthography
But if somebody would tell me a word while speaking in a dialect it would get very difficult
Also Austrians make very little difference between p and b, t and d as well as between g and k.
And the borders between f, v and w are overlapping in German in general
I know it will be gramatically totally wrong, but I just thought of the sentence "near that green glass worm" and thought of it as "vers vert verre ver" :D
(Dialekt) I woas ned wosd moansd, wia lawan e wiama schreim
(Writen) Ich weiß nicht was du meinst, wir labern (is that the standard german word
We would most likely write "reden" instead) so wie wir schreiben
(English) I don't know what you are talking about, we are speaking exactly like we write
Please do not forget that every dialect does contain mostly unwritten work arounds for some words or vowels

Same in Austria
honestly thought that's from Schüssel
I prefer "haisl".
Rural-West Austria: Oachkatzlschwoaf
Oachkatzl is dialect for Eichkätzchen/Eichhörnchen which means Squirrel
Schwoaf is Dialect for Schweif which means Tail
It is difficult to pronounce the hard Ch in this word
German speakers speak the Ch a lot softer and for foreigners, especially English speakers, it is even more challenging as they pronounce it like the C in Car
Oachkatzlschwoaf (Eichkätzchenschweif=squirrels tail)
You forgot your røget ørred med røræg (smoked trout with scrambled eggs)
As others have mentioned, in Austria it would be Oachkatzlschwoaf (squirrel tail)
Not people who don‘t speak our language but Germans, who don’t speak our dialect, actually lol
Things like Oil, moose, an old, not really livable house or smth and other stuff are kinda weird to pronounce for people who only know German (/Standard german)
We here in Styria (at least where I live) kinda say öü/ø-ü (a mix between both, leaning more towards öü) instead of Öl (Oil), which I always think is funny because no German dares to pronounce it the first time
Moose is kinda the same (the El of Elch if pronounced the same kinda) with a ch at the end
And an old house where you can‘t really live in anymore is a Kaischn
And if Germans ask me to pronounce Oachkatzlschwoaf (Squirreltail - Eichhörnchenschweif) I ask them how they would pronounce it first
Sometimes it‘s really funny
So there's the story behind the band name 'Sektion Kuchikäschtli'
That's the hardest one in this thread for me hahaha
Although not as hard to say we have vowel only phrases as well in Austria:
A e? I a.
Is that so
Me too/so do I.
It‘s confirmed: Squirrel is hard to pronounce in any language lmao
My favourite of these in German German has always been "Keule", which means "club/bat".
>These are only used if you talk about them
Talking with them you use their names or pet names
Pretty sure this whole thread is about talking with your friends
Dietrich of Bern, as a mythical version of Theodoric the Great, has more tights to northern Italy and the Huns
(Welsch-Bern is old German name for Verona)
He has also done Cameos in Germanic and Northern sagas (he has even it's own, the Thidrekssaga)
> Welsch-Bern is old German name for Verona
Verona > Berona > Berna > Bern
Nah, king gave it away, she didn't steal it
Rightfully hers
And "Welsch" is an old word for Italian or romance speaking people
AFAIK it comes from the Germanic word for Romans
It means both Romance-speaker and Celtic-speaker, depending on the context
E.g. Welsch is related to Wales, Wallachia and Walnut etc
etc
That word has a complicated and very long history
The opposite to it would be Wends (see: Windische, Windischgarsten etc
) and refers to Slavic speakers
For reference:
Mostly New Year's eve, and certain festivals like the *Danube Island* free music festical in Vienna

This one is from the early times of Austria, during the crusades:
At the siege of Akkon in the year 1191, Leopold V. of Austria got into an argument with Richard the Lionheart, the english king
Their argument ended with Richard throwing Leopolds flag into the dirt, causing the enraged Leopold to travel back to Austria
Later, on his way back to England, Richard was forced to travel through austrian territories
He ended up being captured and imprisoned, and was released for a hefty payment of 6000 buckets of silver
In the end, an argument about who has the right to raise his flag on the tower of Akkon resulted in a new defensive wall for Vienna and 2 new cities being founded in Austria
Ridiculous in a more tragic way, maybe, but I think the way we lost the democratic first Republic might be a good more "recent" contender
Roughly, this is what happened on 4
March 1933:
A vote is held in parliament, it goes through 82 to 79
This turns out incorrect, it was 81 to 80, but still fine sais head of parliament
Christian Socialist Party Members disagree strongly, call for re-vote
First Head of Parliament, a Socialdemocrat, steps down from his position (most likely) so he can vote in a potential re-vote
Second Head of Parliament, a Christian Socialist, annulls vote
Now the Socialdemocrats are protesting
Second Head of Parliament also steps down, probably for similar reasons
Third head of Parliament immediately also steps down for some reason unknown
The Parliament now has no head, this is not supposed or expected to happen and pretty much means it is unable to act
They decide to leave for today, since they can't really do anything, not even close the meeting properly
This situation should be solvable reasonably fast and easy, since the Austrian constitution is fairly well made
Unfortunately the Chancellor wanted to be a dictator, so no
Instead, the Police prevented the Parliament from reassembling and dealing with it and Dolfuß and pals use the opportunity for a coup
The president doesn't stop him
Democracy proceeds to go bye-bye
Honestly, the entire first republic seems to have been just one ridiculous mess after another
Other highlights include "Socialist Uprising, but they can't find their weapon stashes because their messengers are caught and there was apparently no backup plan for this", "Chancellor-Dictator calls Nazis and Hitler Evil, probably for religious and power reasons (and proceeds to be shot by Nazis)" "Vorarlberg tries to join Switzerland but they say no" "Nazi Party has internal disagreement over being democratic (they decide on no and turn to terrorism instead" and of course "Whatever the fuck Schuschnigg was doing in '38".
The [Battle of Karánsebes] Basically the Austrian army hurt itself in confusion
10,000 died
It all started with a dispute over Schnaps
> The army of Austria, approximately 100,000 strong, was setting up camp around the town
The army's vanguard, a contingent of hussars, crossed the Timiș River to scout for the presence of the Ottoman army
There was no sign of the Ottoman forces, but the hussars came across a group of Romani people, who offered to sell schnapps to the weary soldiers
The cavalrymen bought the schnapps and started to drink
> Soon afterwards, some infantry crossed the river
When they saw the party going on, the infantrymen demanded alcohol for themselves
The hussars refused to give them any of the schnapps and, still drunk, set up makeshift fortifications around the barrels
A heated argument ensued, and one soldier fired a shot
> Immediately, the hussars and infantry engaged in combat with one another
During the conflict, some infantry began shouting, "Turci
Turci
" ("Turks
Turks
The hussars fled the scene, thinking that the Ottoman army's attack was imminent
Most of the infantry also ran away; the army comprised Austrians, Serbs, Croats, and Italians from Lombardy, as well as other minorities, many of whom could not understand one another
While it is not clear which one of these groups did so, they gave the false warning without telling the others, who promptly fled
The situation was made worse when officers, in an attempt to restore order, shouted, "Halt
Halt
" which was misheard by soldiers with no knowledge of German as "Allah
Allah
> As the hussars fled through the camps, a corps commander, General of Artillery Colloredo, thought that it was a cavalry charge by the Ottoman army and ordered artillery fire
Meanwhile, the entire camp awoke to the sound of battle; rather than waiting to see what the situation was, everyone fled
The troops fired at every shadow, thinking the Ottomans were everywhere; in reality, they were shooting fellow Austrian soldiers
The incident escalated to the point where the whole army retreated from the imaginary enemy, and Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II was pushed off his horse into a small creek
> Two days later, the Ottoman army arrived
They discovered dead and wounded soldiers and easily took Karánsebes
The [battle of Karánsebes]
Basically two regiments fought over some alcohol, someone thought there were turks, and all of them fled back to the main army
The main army however, who heard the shots fired previously, assumed whatever was coming their way was a Turkish army, so they opened fire
It got to a point where emperor Josef II waa pushed off his horse
Wiener Neustadt-founded via ransom money
> When you go ro live to another EU country you are like and have to be treated like a national of the country you are living now, same rights, same duties, same benefits, same taxes
Exception: national voting rights
You're only allowed to vote in your country of residence  on a municipial level (in most cases), sometimes *I think* on a regional level (definitely no in Austria though) and in EU-elections
On a national level you still vote in the country you're a citizen in, not your country of residence
It is in Austria
If you do not have a job/place of study after 3 months or can't prove you are financially self reliant (meaning you do not need the social security net) you are ordered to leave, if you do not comply you get deported
Main reason for that is that social security payments in Austria are tripple that of wages in some of the poorer parts of Romania and eastern Slovakia, which are quite close
>Similarly some countries stop allowing their citizens to vote if they live abroad for too long
So they can end up having no right to vote anywhere
I did not know that
That is kinda fucked up
The world headquarter of Red Bull is in Austria, in [this Bond-villainesque complex] in Salzburg, owned by [this Bond villian]
The Duke of Austria and his quarrel with Richard I of England gave Austria a few chests of money and provided England with several half mythical heroes  and Villains(Robin Hood, Ivanhoe ...) to populate several hollywood films and animes
[According to this post] and [this list] we have the oldest flag design of any sovereign state in Europe, and the world, going back to 1230
Not the oldest national flag in use by any sovereign state (that would be of course Denmark, going back to at least 1370), but the oldest flag for the region that was the core of today's Austria (i.e. Lower and Upper Austria)
* If I‘m correct (if not, correct me), we were the first european country to banish the death penalty
Sadly, we introduced it again and then years later banished it again, so France was the first country to banish it forever
* One thing I‘m sure about however is that we have the oldest zoo in the world
[Tiergarten Schönbrunn (Vienna Zoo)] It was founded in 1752
It also is one of 10 European zoos that are able to have pandas
The first panda baby of Europe was born in Schönbrunn in 2008 afaik
(Idk how many people know about this, I just love to say it because I love zoos that are able to support endangered species)
In 1976, every Austrian was entitled to buy 1 [„Babenberger Münze“] which is a Gold coin noted at 1000 Schilling (ATS)
The interesting thing is that everyone could buy one in this year without having to pay taxes for it
[Same here
] They have had their house in the center of Vienna since 1222
AFAIK that is even their "global headquarter" since 1809
Don't know if they also own farms/land, but I would assume they do

I‘ve never heard Germany x Austria x Switzerland be referred to as DACH and am wondering why I didn‘t think of that

another interesting one, sushi has only become a widespread dish in Japan since after the introduction of uninterrupted cooling logistics

That‘d be perfect XD
Except there's no fight, it just changes all the time

Not so long after = earliest records of adopting it are from the mid 14th century [according to the official website of Denmark, denmark

I don't hate them
Cashiers use them for change money
I use them sometimes to pay the exact amount, and the cashier is happy to receive them because it makes it less likely to run out of them
So, what's the problem
&#x200B;
Sure, it has downsides
But "everyone hates them and no one uses them" is plain wrong
So the reason why our money is spent on those small coins is so that we can be tricked into spending more money
Got it
Except no merchant will round down, it just goes up
No I don't.
Just multiple spelling errors
Have retailers in Italy, Ireland etc gone bankrupt
So how would it be a problem for German retailers
Some prices will go to 2 and some to 1
How is that complicated
That souldn't be legal
In fact, if a price is 1,99 or something like that I don't let them keep the 1-cent  out of principle: If a shop wants to trick us with those bs prices, at least they should have the expenses of keepin lots of 1-cent coins at hand
Sorry I don't understand what you saying
Sure, but this wasn't a reason why we need to keep them anyways
Just saying that not everyone hates then, and people do use them
Well clearly it is cheaper to pay lobbyists to make sure nothing changes :-)
I think you are misunderstanding something
Nothing about this is any complicated
The price is 1
99, you pay 2
The price is 1
97, you pay 1
There is really no thinking involved there
There is no difference between cash and card from the way it is now
You just don't give out 1 and 2 cents
And old cashier women are typically way better with numbers than any of us young people
>By the way if you have this thing in your country for certain time, you sure don't find this complicated, but for me, who heard this for first time
I get the idea but it would be hard to implement
I have heard Finland and a few other countries are using that
Why do you think its hard to implement
"Hey guys, don't return 1 and 2 cent pieces, just round to the nearest 5
" and boom its implemented
I don't mean pricing 1,99 should be illegal, it should be illegal to say so but then keep more of your money
Which in the end is just a ploy to get people to pay with card instead of cash
Except for those cases where it would round down instead of up
That would be a more or less good system, except I can't see it ever becoming reality, because greed
Well, I am all for discontinuing 1 and 2 cent coins if at the same time pricing stopps that would need 1 or two cent coins
Make it 1,95 or 2€, but don't lie to me
Well, learned something today
If 1 and 2 cent coins are abolished, I'm absolutely sure that not all EU countries would adopt Swedish rounding
There will be governments that go "fuck consumers, retailers can round how they want".
Pretty much the same as you described here in Austria
Boy scouts are Pfadfinder
Yes
Carnuntum probably has the best preserved ruins - mostly just foundations, floor mosaics and such
And the remains of an amphitheatre
Vienna also was founded as a Roman city, so when digging in the city center they regularly find remains
I quite literally live on one
Vindobona was a Roman city where Vienna is now
There are still a lot of artifacts and old buildings (in the ground of course)
There's a museum about it also
Same goes for the city of Linz in Upper Austria
Both Linz (Roman "Lentia") and Vienna (Roman "Vindobona") were fortifications at the Danube, which was the Limes/border between the Roman empire and what the Romans called Germania
Lentia was in fact devastated several times by invading Germanic tribes
If you remember the beginning of the movie Gladiator, where Russel Crow's character goes north to a military camp to fight in a battle against Germanic tribes
It is supposed to take place in  [Vindobona] at the end of the [Marcomannic Wars] which is also where [Marcus Aurelius] died in 180 AD (not just in the movie)
Flavia Solva is a small one, there is a café wher you can look through glass at the Roman foundations
Don't forget Enns or Lauriacum - the oldest settlement in Austria

A bit late to the party, but as I'm reading this the song is played in the background in an construction office in Sweden
some Austrians here, but mostly Swedes and Germans
Still playing that Austrian tunes lol
I'm not a Schlager fan at all but Griechischer Wein is a master piece
You are calling Falco guilty pleasure
Ausbürgerungsverfahren wird eingeleitet
Reminds me of more calm Tropico songs
Now I have
I am speechless
Ah scheiße, i hätt gmoat de woin wissn wos hoid berühmt is
Zu spät, der Abschiebflug geht in einer Stunde
feeling at least somewhat insulted when you get called German is rather universal
And after this horrendous claim we educate that person, that Hitler was born in Austria and because of this, we are supirior to the Germans
For whatever reason
I was thinking the exact same
spotted the Bavarian
Lolwut
I never do this haha
I’m from Austria, we also think putting ketchup on pasta is disgusting atleast I do
I have never seen anybody, beside a German, commit to such a kitchen-crime
Probably also about ketchup on pizza
With Mozart we Austrians are not on the same page
Because when mozart was born Salzburg (his birthplace) was not with "Austria". Salzburg was its own archdiocese
So Mozart is from Salzburg
If you ask someone from Salzburg he/she will tell you this
Thats something i can agree on
I think he means that being German is nothing to be proud of, because it's not an accomplishment, but just pure luck in the genetic lottery
Be proud of what you did, not where you are from
That goes for all countries
Nope, Salzburg is a liked state
I don't know what nutvillager wants to say
With that logic Nikola Tesla would be considered Austrian
And try to tell a Croatian or Serbian that Tesla was Austrian
I only did that once (as a joke) haha
Doesn't take that long, no
German speakers are easy to identify and once you switch to German you can easily tell which country they're from
Yes, it was a few years a ago in Italy, we were  there with our school
On our last day there we got really Drunk with our Italien Friends, to the point,  where I spoke somewhat drunken english with a guy From my school and we didn't realise until we sobered up a bit
Happend to my dad at work
He was having a meeting with partners from Montenegro and they all sat together speaking English
It took a while for my dad to discover that one of the guys was actually from his own company and could speak German
The other guy also didnt know my dad was from Austria so they spoke English with each other the entire time
Happened to me in Spanish
Dude had a first name that is very common in Austria, but a flawless Argentinian accent
He didn't switch to German even though he was aware I was Austrian, so we just kept talking in Spanish for >10 minutes
I just thought, sure if he insists
Turns out we even was from my region
even from their english accent you can tell them apart most of the time
What savage walks over red
You have to respect the Ampelmann
Or, specifically in Vienna, the [Ampelpärchen]
It's usually handed to you personally or to a neigbhour, but since Corona most Services Just leave them now at door
Was never stolen or tampered with, but some services are rather creative and put them at my basement door which I don't use everyday so I find a suprise packaga after wondering why the Status ist delivered but nothing came
Nope, after the second delivery attempt if no one is home we get a yellow letter or an e-mail informing us where to get the package and by showing the letter at the counter we get our package
(usually the closest post office) :∆
no, since packages are normally delivered and signed, or taken back
sometimes they're left with neighbors or in [shared parcel boxes] if any are installed
porches are rare, if packages are left on terraces or the like they're normally not visible from the street
I'm pretty sure it's Mariupol
The main attraction of the city is a statue of the metallurgist
"Soulless" is such a stupid designation to give to a place
Not every single city has to entertain and amaze you as a visitor
To the people living there it is their world with emotional value attached to it
Hannover
Had to spend 2 hours there before going to the airport
Was depressed after 10 minutes
I've never seen a place that dull
Pölten, the capital of lower Austria, is ugly as hell
Berlin
I always thought Linz was a soulless city with nothing but industry and the main shopping street which is compared to salzburg or innsbruck quite unimpressive
After moving to Linz I have found many cute and interesting places which i just never stumbled upon when visiting the city
Now i think Linz is more interesting than Salzburg because it's cheaper and less crowded and it doesn't feel so "stuck up" like Salzburg around the time of the "Festspiele".
nice destination for a bike trip; all the bars having outside seating make the old town a nicer place than Vienna, tbh
Freiberg is nice
the Phoenix park is great
I'd still visit
Mostly because I'd love to finally visit Ukraine, but anyway
Grew up in Linz
I still hate it with a passion :D But I'm happy that there are some people who enjoy it
Same experience, but with St
Pölten (I know, I know)
It's actually very green, things are not far apart and lately the public transport (bus network) is getting somewhere as well
Walking the 10 minutes from the train station along nice baroque buildings and then being surrounded by greenery along the Traisen bike path, I now like it more than Vienna sometimes
Who would've thought
My personal entry for soulless city is "Horn on a foggy day in October".
And overrun by Austrian tourists drinking cheap beer, and full of ugly souvenir shops
Oh I'm happy you liked it so much
I feel like Linz is a little less "in your face" with its attractions so you have to either look for them or know someone for a really good time(or just be lucky)
Yes the old dubliner is a really nice bar but can be quite crowded on saturdays
One of the christmas markets i right in front of my house which means i won't have to cook for the next 3 weeks, absolutely amazing
I hope you will find another reason to visit it again although i wouldn't put too much faith in the LASK
oh no
may i ask what you hate about it
Or is it just a general hate
The fact that I grew up in one of the quarters made up of ugly 70s *Wohnblöcke* (think Neue Heimat) surely didn't help :D It's a pretty little old town, surrounded by a lot of hideousness
Also, I don't like its utter whiteness - it was the Führers favourite city for a reason
And also, I seriously never felt so unsafe in another place, and I have lived in several big cities around the world
oooh yes these are hideous :( They recently renovated a few of them but it didn't help much :D
Whiteness
Well the Führer would luckily be devasted if he'd walk through one of the parks/franckviertel/the trainstation but i guess this changed more since 2015
Really
ok i guess that's subjective as it is very save
guess it also depends on the district you're in
I live in the nice, clean ond town district so it's great but I'm sure I wouldn't like it that much if i lived further away from the Landstraße.
Oh, I was attacked once on Landstraße, and once on the Hauptplatz
By white guys, both times
But maybe it has changed a bit since, I only go there to see my parents
sadly the problems nowadays are mostly refugees stabbing each other
They even introduced a weaponsban in the old town area
Probably it would make more sense to invest in education and social infrastructure than into a militia of half-wits ... but what do I know
I once had somebody say „Das Wetter ist schwul“ instead of „Das Wetter ist schwül“ because they didn‘t have umlauts on their keyboard
Schwül means humid/timid weather, schwul means gay
And I always use it as an example as to why umlauts are important and you can‘t just replace them with u, o and a lmao
knackwurst
kackwurst
knackwurst is a type of sausage and kackwurst is shit
Another nice example is schwul (gay) and schwül (humid)
Perfectly shows that no, you can't just leave out the diacritics
Also in the same vein
Schweißausbruch vs
Scheißausbruch
Schweißausbruch is a sudden sweat attack and Scheißausbruch is a sudden shit attack
Compared to others neighbours petrol and diesel is quite "cheap"
Mobile plans
Cigarettes
I pay about 5€ per pack
Public transport and standing tickets to opera houses (but not everyone knows that:))
I suddenly have the urge to move to Romania
Lol here you barely get 100 Mbit/s for 46€
don't worry he has his own
I have 125mbit for 32€ and could get 500mbit or even gigabit if I wanted
Time for a new contract
I pay less than 20 € for 30GB in Austria, can't imagine the German situation is much different
I love them
I was always so excited as a child when there was a thunderstorm and the electricity stopped working
Or when there were heavy summer rains and I could run into the garden and run around in them
So good
I love thunderstorms
Get a cup of tea
Sit under a roof outside and just watch the show
Lmao if you dont come out sabina will come inside

Lmao if you dont come out, sabina will come inside
I like mine better
Now it doesnt happen anymore, but 25 years ago it was normal to have balck-outs
Strong winds could already cause that
I think "foret noire" or "Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte" is of German origin
At least its namegiver is located in Germany
Yup, exact same thing
I like to do that with idioms
A common sentence if you want to rudely tell someone to leave:
> Hau dich ueber die Haeuser
would translate to
> Throw yourself over the houses
But my favorite is translating
> I'm in a pickle
word for word into German
Grüß Dich, ich bin der Johann, schön, Dich kennenzulernen

Greet You, i am the John, beautiful, You knowing-to-learning

According to kill count: Ticks, wasps & company, parasites, dogs, cows
According to "oh shit that big-ass animal is way too close": wolves (very few though), bears (hardly any), boars, rats, cows
I guess theoretically a lynx could kill a human, but they are so shy, they can go around undetected by anybody for years
I would say a wild boar with piglets
Wouldn´t want to mess with them
Of course, we have bears too, but the likelyhood of actually getting in contact with one is near zero and if you do, they will most likely back off and run away
But I wouldn´t want to have an encounter with a wild boar in the forest
They could really fuck you up big time
Other than that (yeah, ticks may be dangerous too, when you are being infected with FSME, but there is a vaccine for that) we don´t really have dangerous animals here
There might be some very rare snakes (sand viper) in some parts of Austria, but the likelyhood of ever meeting one of them is practically zero
You do have a lot of bears in Slovenia, but have you had any serious incidents in the last years
People here are afraid when a bear is spotted
There are probably one or two bears in the whole country
At the same time, i know several people in my area who got heavily injured by boars, one even died
There's wolves that far west
numbers and proximity to humans
Tigers generally avoid humans while snakes feed on animals that live near humans like mice, rats, etc
Thank you, very interesting
I will keep it in mind next time i visit
Yeah but biologically the Iberian peninsula is almost its own thing
It's separated from the rest of western europe by the pyrenees
Same goes for the Italian peninsula
Also, Iberia is very empty, so wolves are less of a surprise there
But Belgium is such densely settled country, I thought that was kinda surprising
i don't have the numbers - and they may vary a lot for different regions - but it's possible for some regions
I'm rather sure it's not the case here but maybe somewhere else, where there are virtually no deaths caused by other animals :D
In Austria the draft is (still) mandatory so I spent 2 months near the hungarian boarder
One week in one of my colleagues decides it would be a great idea to shoot towards Hungary
The next week someone else accidentally set a car on fire
It was a strange time
You've just reminded me: I think my unit accidentally invaded Slovenia at some point
We were on training in Carinthia and had the afternoon off
My unit leader wanted to show us the mountains and the setting of some intense battle between the Austrians and ~~- no idea - the Turks maybe
~~ Italians apparently
I don't know, but he went on and on about the tactics in the mountains
The thing is, the street we were on was the road to Slovenia, and our driver just drove without thinking (as is asked of you)
Then, we suddenly were in a tunnel, in our military vehicle, in full gear, rifle in hand INLCUDING BLANKS
Yeah, that was the tunnel that separated Austria and Slovenia
Needless to say we were a little on edge about what awaited us on the other end
We quickly turned around then
~~To my knowledge, we didn't cross a Slovenian border crossing yet, but we did cross the geographical border for sure
~~ Since we crossed the border, I think if you wanna be nitpicky we technically invaded
Edit: u/Big_Dirty_Piss_Boner has their facts straight
Thanks
>My unit leader wanted to show us the mountains and the setting of some intense battle between the Austrians and - no idea - the Turks maybe
I don't know, but he went on and on about the tactics in the mountains
I'd guess Italy in WWI
Nobody fought the Turks in the mountains
> To my knowledge, we didn't cross a Slovenian border crossing yet, but we did cross the geographical border for sure
I think if you wanna be nitpicky we technically invaded
There is no Slovenian border crossing
The only border crossing there is at the entrance of the tunnel on the Austrian side
When you are on the other side of the tunnel you are already in Slovenia
I am guessing you were in Bleiburg
I was stationed there for training for 8months (I think
) and there is a famous story there that some soldiers from Slovenia showed up at our barracks
Since most of the people ther spoke Slovenian they quickly found out that they went on a march and got lost in the mountains and somehow ended up here
They just told them the way back so no big fight or anything but I guess u guys paid them back
We had a few disputes with the turks, but those were ~500 years before WWI
Could have been both
The Ottoman empire was a transcontinental empire controlling most of southeastern Europe, Northern Africa and Western Asia
They had wars with European countries from mid 14th century until 1913
Wow, I'm used to all my pro-EU subs so much by now that I was extremely surprised by mostly neutral and some negative answers
Also I knew that in some countries it was very uncommon to show flags or nationslity openly (such as my own), but I never would have thought them to be so many and that the Netherlands would be the exception
I hope our countries will soon be ready to celebrate europe day
There are pushes for it here and there, although small
The 9th May is Europe day
I honestly wouldn’t have known
Also no
Never seen the EU flag on any private property, actually only on state buildings in Vienna for certain occasions
No, its not common in Austria
I think most people have never even heard of Europe Day (what a shame) or are aware that the day before Europe Day is the day the nazis capitulated and may be considered a holiday (even greater shame for this country)
I personally fly the flag on 8th and 9th May
Flying Flags really isn't a thing around here, so hardly anyone has a flagpole to fly one
Some older condo complexes have masts that fly flags on 1st of may (Social Democrats) and on 26th of October (national holiday)
Before I moved in together with my wife I sometimes put an EU flag on my balcony
But as my wife does not like flag flying and has hidden the flag, I doubt I ll do it this year
oh wow that's funny to read
one of the fucking best flags imho, colors, design, what it stands for
personally I would take that flag over any other any day
boring he says, haha
However i just remembered after reading another comment that the tramways in Vienna have little european flags on them in the first weeks of may in celebration of these days
But as i said above most people have no clue why
The usually fly them all year round tho
Nothing special for Europe Day
Francos Spain ironically enough fell so fast because the monarch Franco wanted on the throne also supported a democratic spain and made full efforts to transition to democracy asap
It's not like the Ussr's satellite states had not tried to break away either both czechoslovakia and hungary had revolutions that were brutally put down by the soviets

The Migrumpies for Austria
If people try to tell you you should watch Muttertag - it's a classic, but the migrumpies are waay better and waay less dependent on your ability to understand the Austrian dialect

You need an AUSTRIAN to fail such a project
I'd replace Kurz with Sanna Marin instantly
Nobody needs this slimy wannabe-Orbán.
And she is hella smart
Finished school with the best possible grades and obtained a PhD in quantum chemistry
Isn’t the queen technically also German
next you will tell me you also like trump
Well, yes
I only made the comment because the first argument of OP was a German stereotype
However, we are talking about nobility - whose whole right of existence is based on their ancestry
I love my language and especially my dialect
It just sounds like home
When you hear somebody speak it in an other part of Austria or in general hearing German
It is just like yes I know where you are from
And to oftwn you actually know them, or have at least seen them
I love the thing with the nouns everyone mentions
But also our direct words, like Flugzeug (Fly-thing,plane), Spielzeug (playing-things), Brustwarze ( breast-wart, nipple), there are more but I can't think of any
Also I love the "ch"  and "sch" sounds ( yes I like the way swiss people say it I like the soft "ch")
I certainly have more things but it is late and I am tired
I love how Austrian German can sound very nice and harmless, while being really graphic
Also, it's really versatile and expresses a lot with the melody of a sentence
For Austria you know what I‘m boutta say: the dialects
We have such a wide variety of dialects, I googled how many and according to studies there are too many to count them
And sometimes not even Austrians understand the dialect of another Austrian
It‘s really interesting imo
Also it seems like Germans are suckers for Austrian dialects or are at leats really interested in them
And other than that, I just like (Austrian-)German itself because you can always make up new words by just taking other words and sticking them together
There‘s no limit
(E.g. the german word for towel is Handtuch - hand cloth
Then there‘s Handtuchhalter - hand cloth holder and it could go on and on
) Also how ridiculous some words sound, because everything is literally
Plane - Flugzeug [fly thing], Toys - Spielzeug [play thing(s)], Clothes - Anziehsachen [put on things]
It‘s really funny
>and especially my dialect
It just sounds like home
Fuigas
Es is wirkli sche
In German we have a "silent h" which has a similar function
The hard thing when learning the language is to figure out which "h"s are silent and which are not
Oh man we got way too many offal recipes
Beuschl (upper innards, or specifically lung), Hirn mit Ei (brain with scrambled eggs), Kutteln (tripe - i.e. cow stomach), ...
Not very common, but my great-grandmother had this recipe, which is still getting used:
It's basically pancakes stacked on top of each other with ketchup and meat (not like, steak, but "minced" meat, had to google what it's in english) between the pancakes
Suler yummy to me, disgusting to everyone I've told the recipe to
Bruckfleisch
It's really good though
I do that too
It's super good
Googled
Diaphragm ... ok, that's just a tough muscle, nothing wrong iwth that
But heart arteries
Seriously
That would freak me out too much
Idk, is liver considered disgusting
It tastes way too good for that
It is
You just have to get over the fact that it is brain
My little Brother loaded his Plate with it at a Buffet, ate 90% of it until we told him what it was :(
Said the person from a country where they put sugar into everything, including bread
tbf the inner and outer organs of common staple food animals (cattle, pigs, chicken, sheep) are eaten in most cultures
It's part of using the whole animals and all
I once ate a great Beuschl-like dish in Rome, it had a different name, but essentially it was the same parts
Only in the last decades that got somewhat lost
E.g. in Europe we don't eat pig's ears any more, they are sold as dog food
Or they are sold to China, where they are still eaten regularly in parts of the country
Because more and more people don't like those things, every year millions of tons of slaughter waste has to be thrown away
They look a bit like calamari, also the texture is similar
But yeah, Bruckfleisch definitely isn't for everyone
Never
It has been 9 years
I bet you can find those things also in the US in more rural areas with a tradition of cattle herding, like somewhere in the Midwest or Texas
I agree
Same in Austria
I sure do say oke
There's no y/i at the end
I think almost everybody says "oke" in austria while germans tend to say "okay"
I’d just show him a map and say “You fucked up
we still dont have south tyrol back
Someone from 1919 I think would be pretty amazed about how our country not only survived but prospered
Also he might be weirded out by the Sissi Hype
"There's gonna be ups and downs, not necessarily in that order"
Actually it got called 1st World War as soon as 1918
Let's warn him/her of Greater Serbian sentiment in a Yugoslav project
Maybe it takes
Let's make that after 1938
Timetraveller from 1919: "So we haven't united with Germany
:("
Me: "eeeh
lets just say it didn't work out"
Nah, this person would have lived it in the years after the assassination
They made commemorative Sisi *everything* in the aftermath and flooded souvenir shops in Austria and abroad
Statues and monuments were erected in the countries she often visited in her last years
Coincidentally, the first movie about Sisi (or her death, rather) was made in 1919, directed by her niece
It wasn't released until 1921, so our visitor wouldn't have seen it, but the cult of Sisi is definitely not a recent thing
The Romy Schneider Film was more of a culmination of everything that came before rather than a beginning of the hype
More like „No, but we are kinda united with most of Europe including Germany in some way
What
The internal cohesion of the SHS state suffered tremendously under the prevelance of a Serbia first mentality among a part of its population
That went to the point of parliamentarians assassinating each other over this nationalist mentality
Just ask Stepan Radic
That sentiment was even more pronounced under the 1928 royal dictatorship
Southslavism was severely threatened and almost by that
There's a prehistory of animosity to the Croatian collaboration with the Nazis you know
Tito and the communists revitalized the concept again
However as communist regimes do they coupled it with the man on the top and the ideology and when Tito croaked the Serbian primacy in the federation again became too noticeable and spured much animosity
The Serbian-Croat-Slovene state had quite a bit of negotiating power during the conference but did not get the full extent of their claims still
Ehhhhhh
There were still a load of Ukrainians in the Communist party as officials
The Russian party was of course the head honcho but the Ukrainians still had their place in it - especially in the administration of the Ukrainian SSR
Japanese democracy was heavily guided by the military and navy since the 1880s and alligned with their imperialistic whims
It was all a sham
Let's hope that Le Pen and her partygoes to way of Boulanger or Maurras and theirs
The way in which the Balkans was intermixed made sure that any solution based on ethnical nationstates would end in tragedy
Let's hope but it looks bleak - especially if it continues to go the way of Hungary
Im a historian xD Also helps that I love France
But all in all not very well known outside of specialist circles
You referring to Austria Hungary
Because even Yugoslavia was a nation state (in this case for the "yugoslavs")
In its selfclaimed goal the second Yugoslavia under Tito attempted an amalgation of the various constituent peoples into a single identity
Also being "Yugoslav" and being croatian, serbian, etc at the same time doesnt exclude one another as for example with Bavarians, Hannoveranians, etc all becoming "German"
The attempts to make the Yugoslav ethnos can be seen for example in the curriculum for learning BHS languages at school was unified and the language streamlined in order to create a situation similar to Italy where there was also a need to create an identity after the unficiation
So to put it more succinctly Yugoslavia was a "multinational" state but oversaw the attempt to homogenize the southern slavic peoples into one ethnos
The eastern Adriatic coastline
Especially the time when it was the border between the Ottoman Empire, Venice, Austria and the Italian principalities
The Republic of Ragusa comes to mind
Somewhat of a wild maritime borderzone in the backyard, including everything from Island fortresses to pirates
I didn‘t even know that Austria actually invaded Poland during (or after
) WW1 and that my moms family had to change their last name to something more „Austrian“ to get money or something like that (I think that‘s how I remember the story)
I don’t know about the rest of Austria, but I can speak of Vienna through the eyes of an urban planning student
There are quite a few urban renewal areas that boast impressive modern architecture like Sonnwendviertel/Wien Hbf, Nordbahnviertel, Eurogate, Viertel Zwei/WU University, Kaisermühlen (arguably older), or even smaller areas like Ensemble or star22
However, the most jaw-dropping area has to be the Seestadt Aspern
It‘s basically a whole new large-scale urban neighborhood being built on the outskirts of Vienna and is supposed to be able to function independently from the rest of the city
While it doesn’t really have any skyscrapers, it focuses on vibrant architecture and public spaces, so you pretty much always have some kind of streetlife over there
As for my hometown of Timișoara, Romania, you have Iulius Town, City Business Center and ISHO as the most modern areas in the city
If you’re interested in modern architecture and planning, I suggest you visit any of these places
As a whole complex, the business university WU Wien
It's because we usually add new buildings to really old ones, but this was built new from the ground up, so it all looks really modern
I'd add the DC Tower to that list
And the [WU Campus] Has been used as a backdrop in quite a few Sci-fi-movies already
I‘m studying it in Vienna at the Technical University (TU Wien)
It’s called Spatial Planning/Raumplanung here, so you’d also study other aspects of planning like regional or traffic planning
If you‘re coming from Eastern Europe, then yes, it‘s a perfectly decent university to study planning at
However, since I‘m almost finishing my degree, I suggest you do some broader research and find out what other universities in the west have to offer
In this field it‘s always important to have your study input up-to-date and to keep it international, which hasn‘t always been the case at TU
On the bright side, apart from knowing German, you have no admission requirements whatsoever here
Wish you best of luck in pursuing a planning career
came here for this
Towns with the name [Öd] in Austria and Bavaria literally meaning ~"dull".
We are full of short place names like au (vorarlberg)
But some big citys have short names too wien (vienna), graz, Linz, ...
Many places called Au, translates to meadow
Au is also used as an addition to places e.g. Eckartau, Ramsau, Schwendau
In my valley alone there are hundreds of Aus
Same in Austria
And we have a few "Oed", too
We also have an Au
wanted to comment the same lol
The unigoat looks rightfully pissed off at being endangered
Baggins was translated to Beutlin here (Beutel means bag or sachet)
There was a huge outcry at the new translation of A song if Ice and Fire ten years ago
They translated some surenames and place names to German
Imho that was weird but some names sound funny at the first time but they didn't translated it literally and sometimes it sounded really like a medieval German place and sometimes odd
A odd example would be Kings landing which was translated to Königsmund (literally kings mouth)
If you think about the name you realise it's meant the mouth of the river it's located, but it's odd nonetheless
A more petty example would be Casterly Rock to Casterly Stein
The arguments were that Rock should be literally translated to "Fels" which sounds stronger
But imho that's petty because "Stein" is a common name part of mountain/hill castle in real life
Edit:
I nearly forgot, Lord of the Rings got a new translation too (well that was a biiiit
longer ago) and there the Hobbits use colloquial speech, like calling Frodo "Chef".
The feelings about it were very mixed
As far as I remember in the old translation the Hobbits speak to "clean" compared to the English version but the new one sounded to modern
> The feelings about it were very mixed
As far as I remember in the old translation the Hobbits speak to "clean" compared to the English version but the new one sounded to modern
Oh you mean the first translation of Margaret Carroux (prose) and Ebba von Freymann (for the poems) with the help of Tolkien himself VS
the second translation by Wolfgang Krege
I read the first two parts in the former translation, the third in the latter
I thought Carroux and Freymann did a fantastic job, especially with the translation of all the names and the songs and poems
However the direct interactions of the characters seem a bit
distant
In Krege's translation that is not the case, direct interaction are much more lively and nuanced
However it feels a bit over the top in its try to "modernize" the speech of certain characters (the young Hobbits in particular)
When I first read it in English I was surprised about the emotional depth of e.g. Gandalfs speech, which appeared way colder and more "biblical" in the original German translation
Isn't “reppuli” dangerously close to “ripuli”?
Funfact: Kamehameha was the name of several kings of the Kingdom of Hawai'i before it was colonized and annexed by the US in 1898

> Lock Up - Stallone Prisioneiro (Inmate Stallone)
Now I know Sylvester Stallone isn't exactly a world class actor with a huge range, but that's just lazy
>I guess it's less weird when you're from a coastal region where such names aren't uncommon
It also isn't uncommon in other regions, because places were rivers join each other are often called Gemünd, Gemünden or Gmünd
Yeah, but most people didn't think that far, e.g mouth of the king
What does that even mean
And there was a circle jerk of the translation beeing extreme bad
Imho they did good that the translation sound oldtimey German
It was a bit unnecessary though as there was already an old one whete the kept the place and people names
> An Elfe is more like a pixie in german while an Elb sounds a bit more majestic
Tolkien himself was behind that particular translation
He had the opinion that German "Elf(e)" is a loanword from English "elf", while "Elb" is closer to the "original" Germanic "Alb" (e.g. Albtraum), which makes it sound more authentic in German

Thanks for that insight
Ah okay makes sense
I thought it was their regal name, but now that I think of it, I guess Hawai'ian (regal) naming customs differ from European ones
and for districts in the state Salzburg
Churches have burned down during the war as well, and were rebuilt
And I assume (and hope) that France will do the same with Notre Dame
Yes, it is a hard hit, but it does not have to be the end
I sympathize with the French people to whom this must be devastating, but I personally feel no greater connection to it
Yes, Notre Dame is amongst the most famous, but Europe as a whole has more than enough giant stone cathedrals left
First and foremost, I think we should be relieved no human lives have been lost (so far)
this is incredibly sad
and of course fucking idiots on the news subs are using this to push their racist agenda wtf
I think everybody who appreciates Art ans Architecture feels sad for the loss
I certainly do
I feel no connection whatsoever
It will probably be renovated anyway, so i don't get what all the fuss is about
Not a really fun-fact: today, 74 years ago St
Stephen's cathedral in Vienna was on fire as well
Let's put it this way, I would certainly feel *more* devastated if St
Stephen's in Vienna burned down, but man, not by much
This is horrible
Just thinking about all the love, devotion and work that was put into this building over the years makes me tear up a bit
[St Stephens Cathedral 1945] \- whole album on[this site upper right] corner has an awesome [new roof now]
i second that
Islamist terrorism against a Christian monument
It's quite obvious really
Yes it's absolutely fucking ridiculous, but that never stopped anyone to make uninformed bullshit statements, right
In Vienna, if correcting a neighbor's behavior absolutely *has* to be verbal, then it at least needs to be yelled out of an open window or down from a balcony
Imo, there are a lot of these small cultural details that are shared by "germanic" countries (scandinavia, DACH, maybe netherlands and iceland)
In Swedish, they are called "arg lapp" ('angry note')
Yes, only less German and more Austrian ;)
Luxembourgish doesn't really fit into that group
It's part of the West Central German group, and thus part of the High/Upper German family
Personally, I can understand it about as easily as an Alemannic dialect (Swiss or whatever), which is to say: I have to concentrate, but it's not all too different
All the others are not High German
Flemish is a closely related dialect of Dutch, Afrikaans is a colonial variation of Dutch, and AFAIK relatively intellegible
All three ultimately derive from Old Lower Frankonian
Frisian is completely its own thing, derives from Old Frisian, and Low German derives from Old Saxon
Those two and English + Scots and derivates are usually grouped together as "North Sea Germanic".
I can't really understand any of the latter ones
They sound familiar, and I get some bits and pieces, but overall I can't understand it
Luxembourgish sounds like a quirky German dialect
Iirc it is
Flemish is Dutch
And I understand Dutch good enough to get a rough sense of what a short text is about
Frisian seems a bit easier
Afrikaans on the other hand seems way harder than Dutch
> It refers to the dialects spoken in Flanders
The official language is just Dutch
Thus: a dialect of Dutch

So what is it then
-Herbert Prohaska
That's because you've been to Tyrol
That's not standard austrian german we speak here
You've probably either been to the Zillertal, Ötztal or Paznaun
Which are each known for their particularly different dialects
Yes
But doesn't it sound slightly different to Dutch Dutch
Because that is what I have been told
Yes
And American English is a group of dialects within the English language
Obviously
Saying "Flemish is a dialect of  Dutch" is of course as much hyperbole as saying "Austrian German is a dialect of German" (it's actually 2, 4, 9, or a few dozen, depending how you wanna count it), just as the word "dialect" is not very precise (for the same reason)
But that doesn't make the core of the argument wrong
Sorry, can't help you there
Vienna is definitely disliked by non-Vienna
Not for being a dirty crime-ridden hellhole (it clearly isn't), but for being snotty bullies who lord it over everybody else
For a country this size Vienna is rather large
Its a time honored tradition to hate the capital
Austria
Vienna is amazing
I personally don't dislike vienna, but I think most people do
I mean Vienna is also hated for being a dirty crime-ridden hellhole
Even though it absolutely is not
But non-Viennese Austrians (even some Viennese Austrians) seem to believe it is, because certain people tell them so
Nonsense
I'm Tyroleaan and I love Vienna and the Viennese
What a a shitty reply in a shitty thread
Being snotty bullies is something you also encountet in the more rural parts of the country
The way some farmers treat "Häuslleut" is more akin to nobles treating their lessers than anything else
but you must admit that it *is* a thing to hate on the Viennese
mostly it's done by a certain kind of people that have
very strong ties to their local community, let's put it like that, but it's everywhere and I would even say it's what the majority thinks: complaining about their drivers when you see a W on the car sign in front of you, complaining about their noisy and presumptuous tourists, about the politics, etc
etc

He probably didn't, but half of Austria did in Celebration of the government collapsing
If I recall correctly there even was a concert of the vengaboys in front of the federal chancellery
If you count English, yes that's the expected standard
Since we have English classes from elementary school up, and English is one of the subjects you must graduate in, I'd say yes, especially for everyone under 40-50
In Austria you learn it in school if you want or not
It's not an explicit taboo, but as I would me never ever came into my mind looking into some people fridges i guess it's an indirect one
I honestly have trouble wrapping my head around this concept
what are they hoping to find
I mean unless it's an event where getting food is specified, like a party where there's beer in the fridge or an evening where I invited them over to dinner and asked them to get something or help themselves
but if they're just dropping by
Have fun suckling mustard out the tube I guess
There's also butter probably, and milk

Dude, we're right here
Germany: i love their straight-forward-no bullshit-get to the point-mentality
Also their cars and general technical expertise
Switzerland: I love their language
Schwyzerdütsch is just a gem
Also their sense for democracy, how intensely they partake in the political decision making
Italy: the food, the way of life and how they celebrate all things good about living, the cars and motorbikes (yes, these too, and for entirely different reasons than the German ones)
Slovenia|Hungary|Czechia|Slovakia: honestly, since we share so much of our history with them as one people, they seem so similar to us that i can only say, it's a bit like home (and reminds me of all things good
Liechtenstein: sorry guys, I've only ever met one of you peops back when we were both studying and he was very nice but the cliche was just ridiculously strong with him: 19 years old with a gold watch and a S-class Merc each worth more than a year's salary of mine (now, more than a decade into working life)
Not exactly neighbours, but close enough:
Croatians are chill af
I love the Italian love for kids
Even when you don’t have any kids your own, you just have to recognize that
Kids running around making noise
No problem
The elders don’t complain but instead will interact with the kids in a fun way and enjoy their time with them
It’s really like „the whole village raises the kids“. Seriously, Italy is awesome when it comes to this
Austria is sooooo different in this case
You forgot a bordering country ;)
as Eastern Austrian, I wish

maybe hiking yeah, but the really nice spots are kinda far away
>I like German highways
Well, you were one of the first countries they wanted to bring them to
Well, yes and no
A technical device is easy to break down into what it's made of/for and what it does well/not so well
Whether or not a Champagne is the right for you, no one else can really tell you
Even if people agree on what a certain type/year tastes like, the proof of the wine is in the drinking, so to speak

I would like to say hc strache but then he might go to germany and history showed that that would be a mistake
You're right, we should just let him study art already
Yes there were rules, but I don't know exactly what they are
What I know though is that they basically check if that name has been given to someone before in Austria
If it has it's no problem
If it hasn't then you need to get approval and basically prove that it's a proper name
Funfact: changing your name afterwards is easier and allows for more freedom
Friend of mine had trouble with his son's name and seriously considered to just name him some standard Austrian name and then rename him the next day

It was amazing
I'll never forget the motherfucking [FIRE TORNADO]
Also, I learned the fastest way to empty a full bottle is by twisting and creating a vortex in the liquid
That way there's a constant stream of water outside, while air can get inside in the middle
That comes in handy on a regular basis
Yes
The only other language my parents knew was english so they used that
I'm learning a few less common languages so maybe I'll be able to use something more obscure once I have kids :)
This only works for regions like yours because there it is the standard to speak more than one language
Try Altkirchenslawisch (old church slavonic)
I feel like I'm not going to find that on Duolingo
Now I'm curious what language they speak though
Yes of course
Most people speak at least English here but I’ve never actually heard of someone speaking in a different language so that their child doesn’t understand
What I meant is that for you it’s only natural to speak French besides Flemish, however here in Austria English is not a language people speak here besides German
I worked for some years in tourism - I always liked helping people learning German
But there is one thing that annoyed the absolute crap out of me and every colleague - don't go to people and just greet somebody in their native language
Like going to the ticket counter saying 'Guten Tag
' and nothing more because the polite thing for me is then to answer in normal German but then I have to realize you don't speak (normal) German and everything gets complicated
When approaching people and you don't know the language and you still want to greet in the local language, say a full sentence like 'Guten Tag, I would like to buy some tickets'. And if you are learning German and you want people to talk German to you, then say a whole sentence so we can hear on which level of German you are and react accordingly
My experience in Paris was that most people ignored my French, that was obviously enough to make myself understood and have a conversation, and just replied in English
It was often a bit weird because they let me feel that my French was not good enough . At some point I just stopped trying
I always forget that German is very common among the older generation there, I feel so weird when going on holidays to Croatia and, after me asking nicely in English, they answer in absolutely flawless German
No hard feelings
The country is still spectacular and I know plenty of very friendly French people
Just not from Paris for some reason
Like a cafè/coffee house
The moment you cross the border you get overwhelmed with smells of coffee beans and different cakes and pastries
Or like cigarettes
Schnitzel of course, or the smell of forest and mountain air
Comes down to your preference
Cake, coffee, cigarettes and jagertee or some sort of herbal liquor, because whether you are in the country, I'm pretty sure you will find a place that smells like that
the smell of freshly baked dark bread or a glass of milk directly from the cow
I'd say a mix of expensive parfum, coffee and old curtains in a smokers room
Wait am I just describing a typical Austrian café?!?
And cinnamon
I mistook your flag for a millisecond for an Austrian one and was thinking „What the hell are they talking about
“ when I realized my mistake
Those smells do seem nice
That's a good description, immediately had the smell in my brain
But do you mean the new smell of Railjet, Cityjet, Talent or the old smell of CityShuttle and InterCities
Because I think the differ
Since austria is austria and the countriside shits on everything vienna says if it thinks it is stupid it is somewhat legal in some places
In the sense that you could smoke it next to the police and they wouldn't care
My area is such an area and we have way more problems with drunk people (yes we have way more drunk people compared to high people but still, high people never make problems)
I mean alcohol is way more dangerous and my village would march against vienna if they would try to enforce some sort of alcohol ban so why not legalize canabis
It should be legalized but controlled - i.e. only sold above 18 and in specialized stores
neutral, but I guess legalising it would bring more advantages than disadvantages
Legalized, but with restrictions (age limit and amout per person per month or something similar)
Yes, society and state would benefit from a legalization
The taxes from the sales would create a lot of money which are needed for budgets like health care, education and pension
It would lower the illegal sales and get rid of shady dealers in public parks etc
Maybe there will be an increase in people smoking weed at first, but IMO the effect of curiosity would lay off quickly and people realize the intoxication is very similar to 'common', legal drugs
It would enlighten a lot of (especially older) people
People panicking about teens celebrating 420 everyday forget that this is true for every substance/matter witch is forbidden
Alcohol here is legal at the age of 16, but everyone I know had tried it once at an earlier age (~14y)
Same is true for cigarettes and coffee
When we were old enough to drink, we drank a lot, often way too much, but in the end only you can decide if it's too much for you and how to regulate it
If it's legal or not doesn't matter in this question
And yes, my circle of friends had also people who didn't drink or smoke
The key to drugs is to regulate the usage
If you fall behind on school or get fucked up before work, that's definitely abuse and should be changed
The thing is you can get addicted to everything (sugar, cigarettes, Alcohol, pills, fat/fast food, sports
even working your ass off), but labelling things illegal won't stop people from abusing it
Of course a legalization is bound to restrict the use similar to alcohol usage (forbitten until age of X, no intoxication while driving/work, only sold in special places etc
I guess in Austria it would be sold in pharmacies
Nowadays you can get e recipe for it, but it's very hard to get one and you have to buy it from the pharmacy for 10x the usual price
Me too
They don't care as long as you're looking "Austrian".
If not they're cracking down before you can say Kasperl
Yeah but since the countryside blames everything ether on germans, hungarians, poles or on vienna there will not be a lot for vienna to march on
I mean you can hardly blame the first 3 for it and i garantie you that the city will burn if that happenes
Its really funny if you look back a hundred years
Back then the countryside blamed the Jews and Vienna for everything
The state could have a monopoly or only allow special, licensed shops (like it's for cigarettes here)
Also: Madagascar is not somewhere close the poles
And Tunisia is not in Asia
germany is in central europe, look at the times zones
you phrased it like a fact
> and we don't even use that one much
Omg thank you
Those overly excited Anglos, it's always hard to translate that and having to tone down the excitement level at the same time, but not too much
Also cool article, I've read it a while ago and found our stances quite similar

A friend of mine said the central heating/boiler room of the asylum he worked for was always creepy
Well it was used as crematory in darker times, so may he is onto something
The former concentration camp in Mauthausen feels very creepy, for obvious reasons
It's a big memorial, and a lot of it is still in shape, more or less as it used to be
Another spot is [this big hole in Vienna] were the Wienfluss exits its underground bed in the very extensive canalization of Vienna and then continues to openly flow through a park and into the Danube Canal
I always imagine if you follow the river upstream, into the hole, you'll get lost and never get out again
The Netflix series "Freud" (watch it, it's cool) picked up on that spookiness and included it in the show
As a matter of fact, around the year 1900, [a lot of people actually lived down there]
The fact, that im basically living on a 1000 years old graveyard, but thats only for my village
Fellow viennese here, I saw this hole before but never thought nuch about it, this is so interesting
Do you have any more resources/links on this

How does one even determine what most haunted forest in the world is
It's not like you can take a ghost census
Oh da gibts in Linz auch einen ganzen Haufen

[Other than wikipedia about the river] no, but i heard there's a great guided tour through the canalisation, the "3rd Man Tour" check it out
It starts on Karlsplatz
Also the 1950s Hollywood classic "The 3rd Man" was shot down there, great film
Under normal circumstances they play it once a week in Burgkino
Well, yes
But what with the blood covered sheets and the transparency and the lack of proper address, how do you know you haven't counted most of them twice
What if the most haunted forest in the world is just a single ghost having a lark with the census takers
yes, in dialect you can make whole sentences with it (mostly due to the common dropping of "ch")
"A e i a!" would mean "Oh so me too actually
Austrian-German has a few abbreviated words:
\- i ("ich") meaning "me"
\- a ("auch") meaning "also"
\- e (no real german translation, similar to "ohnehin") meaning something like "anyway", but not exactly
&#x200B;
You can construct a whole sentence with those: "A i e a", meaning something like "Is that so
Me too, by the way
The first "A" is a different comment advert
There actually is a one letter word, "[o]  used in Standard German but it is kind of [archaic] As an interjection it is also mostly used in combination with a second word
Examples, according to Duden (online version) can be:
* "o weh
" (= "oh dear")
* "o Gott
" (= "oh god")
Another example from [Matthäus-Passion] (J. S. Bach) as used in Wolf Haas' "Komm, süßer Tod" (sorry, couldn't resist) as "o" is often used in an ecclesiastical context
* "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden, voll Schmerz und voller Hohn,o Haupt, zu Spott gebunden, mit einer Dornenkron"
(= "o head full of blood and wounds, full of pain and scorn, oh head, bound to mockery, with a crown of thorns")
&#x200B;
EDIT: changed a word in the translation
a - too
i - me/I
I a - Mee too
Standard German itself doesn't have any that I could think of right now
In Austrian dialects though there's
i (short for "ich") which is "I" in English
a (short for "ein" or "auch") which is "a" or "too" in English
Edit: We also abbreviate other words, like "das" ("the") with s, but it doesn't appear without a noun that it's used with so idk if that counts
We do, but just in dialects
"I" being short for ich/I, "a" meaning "auch"/too, "ein"/a

I personnaly believe salaries must be transparent
I would like to know what I need to do to get X or at least why do I get Y right now
Knowing the salaries of people who works longer in the company or higher in hierarchy would help me understand, if it makes sense to stay in the company
It is but we should normalize talking about it openly
It really depends who you are talking to
If you are not exactly friends with someone, it may be inappropriate asking how much they make, or telling them how much you make
It’s not really a thing people talk a lot about
If one of my friends got a new job I do ask them how much they make, but I can’t imagine asking for instance my uncle or my godfather how much he makes
Older generations won't talk about it
Younger ones do
And it helps everyone
Nobody usually talks about it
Maybe if you just got a job (especially when you get your first job) then somebody might ask you „And how much do you get
“ but otherwise nobody really talk/brags/complains about their wages
When a coworker in a similar position asks about your wage, would you still consider it rude
I never find people talking about their wages in my branche which makes me clueless about how much I should be earning and it sucks
Guess it makes companies' lives easier and fills their purse because no one wants to talk about it
Wages are only one part of financial situation
And being open about your salary is generally a good thing since it introduces more transparency into the system

I think that green ones are more common, the most popular type being either filled or unfilled green olives with sour brine sold in glasses
Personally, I prefer black olives since they are often more salty than sour
Source: personal observation
Green by far, I like both but prefer black ones on my pizza

I remember I downloaded belarussian for google translate when I went there and when I was there people told me no one speaks that
> Pretty much everyone who speaks Welsh as their first language can speak English fluently from a relatively young age
Welsh is compulsory in English medium schools and English is compulsory in Welsh medium schools (although the standard of Welsh in English medium schools is lower than the standard of English at Welsh medium schools)
Those who go to English medium schools have to learn Welsh pretty much from the start of education until the age of 16 but many leave still not being able to speak anything beyond the very basics
According to my gf this is very similar in the Basque country
> Once you go further from primary education it starts decreasing as your studies improve
That really depends on the area of studies though
My gf's sister studied medicine entirely in Basque
In my gf's very very Basque home village (i.e. almost everybody speaks Basque all the time, all the Spanish road signs are graffitied over, the parade of the 3 Reyes Magos has been chased out of town with stones once because the tradition is "too Spanish", the government-mandated Spanish flag on city hall is about the size of a sheet of toilet paper etc
) there's a street vendor from Senegal who speaks very broken and bad Spanish, but is incredibly fluent in Basque
He is very well-known and popular in the village, because he's a very open and extroverted guy, so I guess that helps
They also have lots of [Sahrawi] immigrants/refugees, who speak ofc Arabic, good enough Basque and a little Spanish
Latinos usually stick mostly with Spanish (which arguably sounds way more eloquent than Castillian Spanish), but know enough Basque to get by
Their kids learn Basuqe in school ofc, but that doesn't mean that they really speak it
I guess it's a little bit like the situation in Wales in that respect
AFAIK most latino kids go to Catholic schools, that tend to be Spanish-only, with a single Basque language course
However most Latinos live in more industrialized areas anyway, where there's also more working-class people from Spain proper, who came to the Basque Country in the 60s and 70s and never really bothered to learn Basque (also bc it was illegal to teach the language until the 70s)
Nowadays, unless you want to work for the Basque government (i.e. govt official, health care, education, judicial system etc
), you can get by without any Basque just fine
When I'm there I speak Spanish because all my Basque is used up after 2 sentences
My gf's cousins always joke that it's crazy that I speak better Spanish than them, even though they've grown up there
The thing is, they go months without using Spanish at all (they are some very rural, salt of the earth dudes who hardly ever visit the city and are happy spending all their time in the village, on the pasture, or in the woods, I guess in the US you'd call them hillbillies), whereas I use Spanish on a daily basis
Yeah, let's just Habsburg 'em and make them speak German
> German is somewhat less used and more rare, at least in the center-south of the country
I know in the north is a bit different
Tbf most German dialects and Luxembourgish are pretty much mutually intelligbile, right
I can read it well enough at least, and I think after 5 minutes of immersion I could also understand it well enough

If it's a longer way they take the bus
It's a normal bus for everyone not a special school bus
Yes, at least Here in rural place and in Graz
but many people also Take them by Car To school
It's totally normal for kids at around 6 years to walk to school or take public transport
In Western part of Austria Vorarlberg, where my relatives live, even kindergardeners walk there by themselves
That won't work the more East you go in Austria and in Vienna the Kindergarden needs a picture and name of the people allowed to pick up a kid
So if grandma or uncle comes for a visit and wants to pick up someone, parents have to send in the information beforehand
native German; didn't understand one thing
Yeah exactly
Speaking German definitely helps u understanding this
When influencers talk about a photo shoot in English they often call "a shooting" because for some reason we decided to incorrectly incorporate that word into our language
"To get" means "bekommen" in German, so a lot of the time people confuse that with "to become". Very popular mistake in English class is "I became money for my birthday"
I think mother language for native language, because Muttersprache (native language) in German literally translated is Mother language, and if you don‘t know an English word you can just translate the German one literally and sometimes it‘s correct
Or Handy
Everybody gets taught to _not_ use Handy for cell phone
I think if handy is used as a noun and not as an adjective in Britain it could mean Handjob, if I‘m correct
Would be nice if a brit could tell me wether I‘m talking nonsense or not
Generally in German we make everything, we don‘t do
Same in German
Someone being funny and something being fun is described with the same adjective "lustig"
Yup
Same goes for Germans ofc
Handy is the most used word for cell phone, yes
Ofc there‘s Smartphone or Telefon (telephone), but Handy is the most used (aka used by everyone)
Saying "Sinn machen" or "das macht Sinn" is totally normal in Austria, I think germans use "Sinn ergeben" more than us
"Sinn machen" is perfectly fine in Austrian German at least
I‘m not that good at german dialects
I don‘t think so
In English, you can _do_ people (in a sexual way), but if you say that in German it sounds weird af
Except if making a baby counts, because then yes, you can make people
Macht Sinn
I would (in my Austrian German ofc, Idk if it‘s the same in Standard German) say „Ich habe gemacht, dass er das gemacht hat“ which is basically translated „I made, that he made something“
–> So you make people make something
(I‘ve never noticed how weird that sounds up until now)
That works in Standard and Austrian German too
well my mother is from chile, and when i was younger our school sent us out for red nose day(which is collecting money for sick childrens clown, cuz that helps) and i went to  nun to collect a bit of money and she already looked latin to me and i asked her for money for sick children and she responded in more or less spanish that she doesnt speak german, so i asked her in spanish where she was from and she said "De Chile po
" which is a very chilean way to say that you are from chile
that made my whole day because the nun was so happy to meet a chilean in austria
2 years ago I was visiting Paris with my mother
Our visit also included Disneyland (yes 20 year old me insisted)
Around noon the restaurants began to fill up
Predicting this we went there a bit earlier
By the time we were finished with our food the restaurant was flooded with little kids and their parents
Across the room was a woman with a little girl who was desperatly looking for a seat
I waved at her and shouted "Hey Mam do you need a seat
" (Due to my parents having alot of american friends visiting I have a pretty american accent
) My mother followed up in normal volume with "Avez-vous besoin d'une table madame
". Relieved the woman thanked us with her best Merci and turned towards her daughter who was crying for food
She calmed her down with "Es dauert nicht mehr lange
Ich geh gleich Essen holen" (It won't take much longer
I will go to get food right away")
Me and my mum just smirked at each other and wished her a good day in German
We all laughed
That's bad

Not Europe and also not my home country, but I've had a US ID card at some point

It also flips from horizontal to vertical at 21
I found that pretty neat
There is one here in Austria, but I've never even seen one
Reminds me of our old paper driving licenses
My mom still has one like that and it's still valid until 2033
I'm amazed it's still holding together
It's 35 years old and has been through the wash at least twice
yeah it's like that here
there is one, but nobody gets it - why should I pay another 50€ for something that I'd literally never use
if I go to the post office I use my driver's license or student id, if I go abroad I use my passport
ugh, same for driver's license here
I mean they switched to bank card format, but I still have the old foldable one that looks like a little pink book
The backside of the austrian one contains the follwing infos:
* Place of birth
* Nationality
* Hight
* Dates of issue and expiration
* issuing authority
The front side, as seen in the linked article, has
* Name including title
* date of birth
* sex
* signature and photo
I bought one after not being able to board a international bus and having forgot my passport
Super useful to have in your briefcase
"Almost nobody has one" is a bit of an exaggeration, nearly [10% of Austrians] actually have it
for me the most curious thing is that there's a space for two last names :)
ooh we will get that eventually, but it's still a few years out
nice to hear Pt is so far in adopting those e-government things
Passports have it too, was kinda funny when I had my height listed when I got my first passport as a kid and then kinda outgrew that number
;-)
haha, for some reason our pictures always look horrible as well
That makes sense
The ID costs the same as the passport and most people don't see the point in having both
If I didn't travel to the UK a lot I might have gotten an ID instead of renewing my passport
University: University ID (issued by the university)
Travel: Passport, not everyone only travels in Schengen (a very popular destination - Croatia - still is not part of the Schengen area) and a passport costs 75,90€ while an ID card costs 61,50€ (both vaild for 10 years)
> public exams, university exams,
As others said the university ID
But in general you would use your drivers license to ID yourself
The ID card is basically for people who don't have a drivers license
I personally don't understand why the standardized European driving license isn't recognized within the EU as an ID
Now that you mention it, ours is not fabric I think, but it does seem a lot sturdier than regular cardboard
Maybe it's similar to what they use for paper money
As far as I know, that's not a requirement in Austria
If asked by police or something, you do not need to have ID if you're a citizen, they'd just look you up in some national database
Also, to add to that: For general ID purposes in Austria (getting into clubs, buying alcohol), we mostly use our driver's licenses as (almost) everyone has one if they're over 18
Below that it is kind of messy, it's a weird mix of student's IDs, [e-Card] both, passports and the like for getting into clubs
Yes and no, it is a bit more nuanced than this - but in general yes, you won't be fined if you don't carry an ID document as a citizen
Otoh that makes it just more likely to be stolen
A friend of mine got an ID card though to be able to have something more widely accepted in the wallet
Sure you do, that's why people have a passport usually
Afair your birth/citizenship certificate (or documents created from that, such as a passport) + your positive proof that you finished high school ("Matura") and are allowed/able to study
You then get a unique ID number ("Matrikelnummer") from the first university you sign up at and a university ID card with this number, date of birth, name and picture in most cases
As these are issued by the university, they are not national IDs, but in practice they are likely enough to verify your age in a club or to maybe pick up a parcel (haven't tried it and my uni ID is expired by now)
Usually used for checking attendance at tests and to get student discounts
Passport, Birth certificate, certificate of citizenship etc
> What are those
(EHIC + some national stuff, used also to have the ability for a qualified digital signature)
insurance card, some functionality of an e-id was added later on, and was subsequently replaced by Handy-Signatur
the e-id part (and Handy-Signatur) is slated to be replaced by a proper eu-wide e-id though
the e-card was recently upgraded to include a picture to make misuse harder; sadly it's still not usable as proper id though, so that upgrade was kinda useless (and costly; thanks FPÖ)
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say without checking, that Vienna is the answer to all 4 years that have been asked
Most certainly when we consider Austria's current borders, and maybe also when we consider the respective historical borders
Not 100% sure on the latter though, Prague or Buda/Pest/Budapest might have been bigger at certain points in time since 1600, but I kind of doubt it
Now I'm waiting for some proud Czech/Hungarian user to correct /confirm me
I think at some points in the 1800s Vienna was even one of the top 10 biggest cities in the world (#1 being Beijing most of the time until 1900)
It really depends on what you count as "country".
If today's borders are applied when looking at the population in 1600, etc
it will always be Vienna
If we're looking at everything, including the HRE, Prague probably was bigger in 1600
1800 would be a toss-up between Vienna and Berlin with Vienna probably being bigger
It's not all that easy finding reliable numbers for population like that
Well, is this post about present day borders, or about any historical borders that include ones country
I could think of Vienna, if the second one is the case
I have never heard the Slovenian name for Trieste, but it seems fitting that you just took all the vowels, removed them and called it a day
I looked it up, around 1600 Prague had ~60
000 while Vienna had ~50
000
ETA: In 1800, it was already 270
000 in Vienna compared to 70
000 in Prague
Is the name Gradec still in use in Slovenia
Haha I'm so sorry, I removed the BCS a few seconds after I wrote it but you still caught it
I should have realized my oversight sooner by spelling it all out though :)
[In reading up about it I learnt] something new about the relationships between the Southern Slavic languages which was terribly interesting, though
Wow I never even noticed
Yeah i know about Bec
Serbs/ other ex-Yugo folks (?) sometimes use it in graffitis here
We had it in primary school but that didn’t teach me anything
From 10-13 I had this awesome English teacher, she was strict af but after those 4 years grammar really stuck with me
Ever since, I had two other awful teachers so I learned all the stuff through social media, watching interviews of my favorite celebrities,.. What helped me is not only reading and hearing but also writing and speaking it
(I‘m 19 now and my goal now is to improve my skills talking about politics with native-speakers)
I started learning at 11 as well
My dad is an English teacher so he forced me to study my vocab and grammar every evening, read a lot of books with me etc
I hated him for forcing me to do that at the time but now I'm really thankful for that tbh
I eventually started to watch a lot of YouTube, tv shows and movies on my own, and that's basically how I constantly kept improving (obviously through reading books as well) . So yeah my advice would be keep on reading books in English, and watch a shit ton of movies or tv shows
Good luck, you can do it
When I was 14 or 15, our English teacher introduced us to some English books I that I really loved, this got me into reading a lot
Also, as every teenager I was really into music, and wanted to understand what my favourite bands were singing about - that helped me gather lots of new vocab
I began at around age 13, mostly beginning in video games
Mainly CS:GO . Then i started watching youtube videos to improve myself in the game, and nearly all of them were english speaking youtubers
Then, I started watching more and more english-speaking non-csgo youtubers video and (at age around 16) more english netflix series
Today, I mainly watch every series in english
First learned it in school, improved it by excessive internet consumption
You are 31 and it was not mandatroy in high school for you
Wow, would never have thought that for a western european country
It's not actually Erasmus outside of Europe, that's an EU/EEA program
It's also meant to be a cultural exchange, to promote a pan-European feeling in a young, educated generation
If you only focus on quality of teaching, nothing else - just go there for your entire degree or stay home
Erasmus is subsidised, but still quite pricey
Tbh, I think going from Berlin to any place but Vienna would have been more interesting, even if it's to literally any other Bundesland-Capital
At least leave the big city
Going from the biggest German speaking city to the second biggest one is not even close to as different as you can
Literally any Austrian city or town would be more different
I feel culturally much closer to Slovenes and Italians than Northern Germans
Why
Vienna is amazing and if they like cities it's probably the best choice
That's actually interesting, I think because Germany is much bigger, Austrians are aware of the cultural difference, whereas a lot of Germans aren't and are then surprised when they come to Austria or meet Austrians in another country
True
I realize now that my first statement may be a bit narrow minded in itself
True
I realize now that my first statement may be a bit narrow minded in itself
Yes, i can
And i am pretty good at it i believe
I mean i obviously cant tell their citizenship, but i can definetly tell someones ethnicity if they are european
Really
For us its Germans with flip flops on trails where locals would use climbing gear and boots
Good Tips, but for House hold appliences I will say don't fix which isn't broken
Every new appliance we bought is from the build quality and reliability worse then the older ones
In Viennese German, there's the phrase "Ist wurscht", in Englisch it would be "It is sausage".
It's meaning something doesn't matter
This phrase is commonly used
There is also "Über die Häuser hauen" , which is "Throwing over the houses" in English
This means you are about to go away from somewhere
I know, these are more dialect phrases rather than phrases used in the whole country, but I hope someone is interested in these
"Schau ma moi, dann seng ma scho
Translates to "Let's look and we'll see
", Meaning that you just start something to get going and then decide on details during the process
The fun thing about the Extrawurst idiom is that in Austria there literally is a sausage called Extrawurst
This can cause hilarious misunderstandings, or Germans just laughing in Austrian supermarkets
We also have all of those, except the throwing-ham-sausage-thing
And I don‘t think you‘d hear ‚alles hat ein Ende nur die Wurst hat zwei‘ here either
>"eine Exrawurst kriegen" (to get an extra sausage)
Extrawurst is baloney in English (more or less)
>"the a and the o of something" - the most important part of something (stems from greek alphabet)
Thats not a German saying, thats the name of god in parts of the bible and used everywhere in the world
In English you typically say "the alpha and omega
We have the first too, although a bit different: "Wie die Kuh vorm neuen Tor" - "Like the cow in front of the new gate"
Actually, "Pariser" only is another name for Extrawurst here, too
In Austria, Pariser mostly means someone from Paris, or this sausage
Well they might just be older than our modern languages
Lots of those come from the bible and other historic texts
Did you read the thread title
This is about idioms unique to one country
I have never heard an Austrian referring to a condom as a Pariser, which is why I said, that it only means those two other things mainly
I can't answer your main question, as I'm not a Germanist
Not Belgian or Swiss, but I met an Italian guy in London who was surprised to learn that Austrians spoke German
And the guy was from Milano, which is quite close to Austria
And he was finishing his Master of Law in London
I was so perplexed, that I forgot to ask
I really regret that I'll never know what he actually thought
I camped and hiked on Bunes, Horseid and Kvalvika Beach
Each was great and breathtaking but my favourite was probably Horseid since there was no one else around at all
I can only speak for myself but I like Finnish music
For example Käppee by Värttina
I discovered it because it's used in Dj Snake's "Quiet Storm" and in "Colt" by Sierra Kidd
Cari Cari - they make awesome rock music
Parov Stelar - really cool electro swing
Turbobier - awesome punk band
And some smaller austrian metal bands that I really like are Küenring, Venator and Dead Knowledge
[Die Mayerhofner - Schei wi dei wi du wi dei]
Austria: Ankathie Koi
If you like 80s-style music you will enjoy her
Germany: Lilly Among Clouds
She does Indie Pop, her album Green Flash is amazing and her voice is really special
I'm not Danish but there's an Indie Rock band called 'Death Machine'. I discovered them when they played in a pub in my Hometown and they are amazing
Check out their Album 'Orbit'
I enjoy them quite a bit
It really does hit special if you're in a marching band yourself
> I listened to them in the early 2000s with songs like "bon voyage" and more or less skipped everything until I stumbled upon their recent work
It left me a little Disturbed but in a positive way
Same
Lol
I suppose that would be Vienna vs
the rest of Austria :D
Gotta agree on that one :‘D
We're talking international politics here
There is no grown enough there is just grandstanding and the figurative dick measuring competition -_-
Not in Romanian, as far as I recall
We have quite varied accents and dialects (yet always intelligible), but they’re almost never used in media, since it’s traditionally considered low-class/peasantly to use anything else than the literary language
Only in recent years i’ve seen educated people proudly sticking to their own accents, but this is yet to be mirrored in the media
I bin a wunderschener Schmetterling is among those sentences burned into my brain
Sometimes even Austrian
Also dont forget the huge population shuffle as a result of WW2 and the deportations/resettlements
The west has many different dialects and it can differ from valley to valley
Because they were quite isolated in the mountains
In the east, it's not that diverse
In austria, sometimes individual families (especially farmers) have their own dialects
Idk I am from upperaustria and you can soo easily tell from where someone is, Mühlviertel people talk really weird, people from the mountain region are a whole different thing, Hausrucks stretch all the vowels way too long, People from Braunau are basically bavarians and the people in my neighbor village have a weird obsession with öööö. But yes to northern germans we all sound like the same alien language I guess
Are you talking about Færøyene
Because I learned Norwegian, then Danish, and I could hardly hear any differences in Denmark, except some weak accents (like copenhagen, fyn, jylland)
Norway is like Austria though, with real dialects and differences even in neighboring villages/valleys
Wous
Houst dou mei kernööu gseng
Pretty shure he just comes from the west and can't differentiate them because he doesn't speak them
Most tyrolians see most of upper and lower austria as one dialekt while i can tell you at least down to the bezirk where someone from the waldviertel comes from just based of the dialekt
And of course vorarlberger are the worst at differentiating eastern dialekts, most of them think i am styrian even though i am not barking at all
We also can't differentiate many tirolian dialekts, for us they are mostly the same and 80% is the same and the other 20% aren't enough to differentiate if you don't hear them enough
> vastly different shades of barking
*Looks at flair* Sounds about right
Sure but it's way less difference than in deepest Vorarlberg where people from neighbouring valleys sometimes have trouble understanding each other
I agree, you're right
In Carinthia, you can hear that the dialects from the far west at the border to tyrol sound a bit more tyrolean, and in the east (Lavant-valley) sound more styrian
And yes, in the countryside, they can hear when someone is from the next village
I wouldn't have ever heard of anyone "blaming" Americans for pizza Hawaii
Most people just blame fate
And Hitler, while born in Austria, considered himself German, rejected his Austrian citizenship, and his whole career was based in Germany
So I'd consider that pretty much German
Edit: autocorrect typo -.-
That we started the First World War, and blamed it on the Germans
That’s a standard austrian tactic I guess
>Somehow the blame for most things the EU fucks up ends up in Brussels
Really
All I hear is Germany or Merkel herself getting all the blame and hate
>And Hitler, while born in Austria, considered himself German, rejected his Austrian citizenship, and his whole career was based in Germany
So I'd consider that pretty much German
At that time German speaking people in the Austro-Hungarian empire were called Germans
There were a lot of
ethnicities in the empire, but none of that was "Austrian", most people who identify as Austrians nowadays, would have been Germans before WW1
Austrian identity is a thing that only really started after WW2, when we had to distinguish ourselves from the Germans
plus he was born really near at the German border
I don't think you can blame a single country tbh
You voted to remain, thsi would have been ok to say if you would have chosen to remain, but you didn't, you were one of two that voted leave, so you deserve the hate
Even while that was partly true, Hitler went out of his way to become "German", not "Austria". When WW1 startet, he refused to join the austrian army but volunteered for the German army instead, automatically loosing his Austrian citizenship in 1914
So when he started WW2 he hadn't been an Austrian for 25 years
plus he forced Austria to be annexed
Except it wasn't.
If he voted to remain thats fine by me, but wales can be blamed for brexxit (not entirely of course, but they bear part of it), as they, as a whole, voted to leave
So you threw the irish/scottish under the bus because you couldn't properly utilize the benefits the eu brings
Deutschösterreich ist not in any way the same as eastern Germany
The time that Austria was last understood as "eastern realm" were a few hundred years before that
Austria just is its own name since a loooong time
Our "Higher technical" school had a blacksmith, a foundry and machining classes with lathe and milling
Those we're pretty cool classes
I had waitressing classes, as well as restaurant-level cooking, bookkeeping and economics
We even had a few classes on wine tasting, liquor tasting, and bartending
All before I turned 18
I took Ancient Greek in gymnasium and it was definitely my favorite subject, it was as intense as Latin though
I graduated in 2014 and I am pretty sure my school discontinued the offer by now
We were six students in my whole year in this class and one of I believe only 10-or-so schools in all of Austria that offered it
Truly a dying subject
I think I can pinpoint the school you are talking about
in styria
We have it too in Austria - togerher with psychology in the last 2 years of highschool
So it's each for 1 year
It's part of Biology education here
Also in religious education but I don't know If it's part of the curiculum
At least the R.E. Techer obly said basically don't fuck around and If you so at least use condoms and then He let us watch "Kids". Btw Drug education in R.E. was watching "Requiem for a Dream"
Yeah, but I guess other HTLs should have them too
We have somethimg similar but we call it "tourism school"
I hope so
Yeah, there are the Higher technical schools which specialise into mechanical engineering, Electro engineering and/or IT
Those are the Most common
There is also the Business Academies also common
All of them are Grade 9 to 13 (a year longer then the General education Gymnasiums)
Then there are the nursery schools, some of them you can go after the 8th Grade, some require to be 18
Those are also common
Also schools for Kindergarten and elementary school teachers
Then there are many Not so Common one
There are schools for e.g. building technics, for Fashion and Design and so on
Does any country _not_ have those
I think Gmünd is split between Austria and Czechia
There are also a few alongside the border with Czechia, though some of them had their czech opposite become ghost towns after WW2
Where do we have cities/towns like that
I can't think of one honestly
Iceland
Do we
I can't think of any examples in Austria
I meant in mainland europe, but yeah you are technically correct ;)
Looking at the Norwegian border, you don't have _anything_ there to start with ;)
Like ... even those places that show up on far-out zoom levels ... you go in and it's like three hovels cowering together
Surprisingly I couldn't find any either
I would have expected some city on a river being split
Bad Radkersburg wird durch die Mur von Gornja Radgona getrennt
Salzburg/Freilassing, Braunau/Simbach, České Velenice/Gmünd, ...
Giurgiu / Ruse Pyce
Uhm, you do have a land border with Ireland and Spain (Gibraltar)
The only true island nations in Europe I can think of are Iceland and Malta
Romania for instance doesn’t. It looks like when they drew the new borders in 1918 they paid much attention to not dividing any cities
I can imagine that would have caused even more of a clusterfuck, especially with Hungary
There are cities very close to the border (Oradea, Arad, Gyula), but they are entirely in one country
Ah ok das ist interessant, dankeschön
Those are different towns though that happen to be close to each other and a border inbetween
It is not one that is divided by a border
Giurgiu / Ruse Pyce straddle the border for exampl
By that logic, Berlin is two cities, and Vienna, and many other
These cities evolved together
As are most in this whole post
Well, I can remember the Swiss national museum having a gap for WW2 with just a big sign saying "we were neutral so that's cool" and a itty-bitty-tiny sign saying "but maybe we could have helped some more Jews flee, they kind of all died".
I once was in the Alhambra in Granada with some friends, on the 12th of October (national holiday in Spain)
Around noon we were on a tower that overlooked the whole city
At this moment (noon) the Spanish started shooting cannons and gun salutes and fireworks all over the city, to celebrate their "Spanishness". All the birds of the city flew up at the same moment
We didn't expect any of it and were startled for a second
So my Belgian friend said jokingly: "Oh no, the Germans are coming
I said: "Haha, we have that same joke, but we usually say *'The Russians are coming
'* How weird, no
My friend looked at me with a are-you-fucking-kidding-me look
Then I turned on my brain and figured it out
I had always assumed "The Russians are coming" was a Cold War related joke
However probably it's older than that
Not necessarily a historical event, but I got the impression that especially Americans have quite a different view on how we handled the Nazi era and especially the time afterwords
Like banning all Nazi symbols etc
Here we view it as a necessary step to distance ourselves from our past and to not let it happen again or let people portray it differently than it was, like that we were the victims, that the holocaust didn't actually happen etc
My impression is that a lot of Americans view it as us not having freedom of speech and like it is just another form of oppression
He's viewed ambivalently here
A warmonger, aggressor and imperialist (I know, kettle, pot, black), but also an important reformer
Military, Code Civil, organizing the state etc
that triggered certain developments here as well
Well it is majorly a Cold War thing even though it probably is older than that
Funnily enough the shunned phrase "bis zur Vergasung" is from the First World War, not the Second
No respectable person in Austria believes that nonsense amymore and those who do mostly die away, slowly but steadily
That is not something "widely taught" at all
Well that's not true anymore
This might have been like this in the 80s and 90s but nowadays we learn it in school as extensively as you do in Germany
Nobody under 60 would say that we were the first victims
We take our responsibility as serious as you do
I don't know when the last time was that you were in an Austrian school, but that is definietely not what is taught in Austria's schools nowadays
There has been a public debate about this [since 1986]
That's just his French name
In Old Norman the name is Williame
Yeah, Zürich
Otherwise pretty cool museum if you don't know a lot of Switzerland (and need something to do on a rainy day), but that was pretty shite
Also, a tiny plaque mentioning the extremely late voting rights for women in a room supposed to show how progressive Switzerland is
Mislead supporters and willing enablers
Nobody denies the hundred thousand people cheering for Hitler's speeches nowadays
It was kinda glossed over in the years after it, and we put ourselves in the victim position
But that sentiment seems to change in the last 20 years or so, but there is still a way to go
with that
I would say the current view is mostly realistic
There were a lot of supporters although they probably often had no idea how bad it would get (concentration camps etc) they probably mostly supported him for promising them a better future and Antisemitism was pretty wide spread in Europe and certainly also quite popular in Austria at that time
But I guess we can't see our ancestor's as purely evil either
There were some that fully supported all parts, some did not know the full extent or tried to keep out of it and turned a blind eye and there were of course also some who openly critized or worked against the Nazis
I think this more nuanced view is pretty important here as we try to understand how this could happen and that our ancestors were just evil isn't a very good explanation
But obviously we also have Neo-Nazi who would probably give you a different answer
You guys should have taken a page out of Germany's / Austria's book: condense all your historic shittiness into a 10 year period and then apologise profusely for it instead of dragging it out for centuries
I just looked it up and you really have to take that into context
It is a memorial for the first victims of the Nazi and it explicitly reminds us to never let that happen again
But it might not be the best choice of words
Exactly
You're just one major atrocity away from redemption
Have thought about invading France and shipping the French to the Falklands as cheap (free) labour on the rock farm's there
I am not a history nerd, so correct me if I am wrong, but my impression was that a lot of people wanted to join Germany and anyone who didn't probably would not have a fun life
Have you ever seen that [ballot
] AFAIK that wasn't a secret vote either
So we weren't just victims, but it wasn't really up to us to decide either
Is that impression true
>a lot of people wanted to join Germany
So we I guess we agree on that
I am just saying that most people welcomed them, but even if they did not it would not have made a difference regarding the outcome
I speak a Bavarian dialect natively, so German and Bavarian are fluent
English is too
As for the others:
Swedish: Maybe a fourth, maybe a third or so of the words
Norwegian:  About the same
Danish: A bit less
Dutch: I actually know Dutch, but only at like A1 level so I didn't understand all of it
Still got most of it though
The things I didn't understand I could pretty much all get through context
Low German: Same as dutch, though I didn't study this
Luxembourgish: A bit less than those maybe, but still understood it pretty well
Afrikaans: Also understood a lot of this, similar to the former two/three
Islandic: Even less than Danish, maybe every tenth word or so, possibly less
You can understand about every other word
Especially Dutch, Swedish and Danish are pretty easy to understand
I understand a few words in swedish
Absolutely nothing in Danish, Norwegian or Icelandic
Like someone else said: it's elvish
Dutch and Afrikaans are easily understandable in context though it takes some time to get some words
Luxembourgerish is also somewhat understandable within a context
The german dialects I all understand without any problems
German 100%
Bavarian 100%
Low german 80%
Luxembourgish 85%
I'd like to hear some more people's experience with alemannic
I've heard quite a few Austrians and Germans state they understand nothing while I myself understand pretty much everything
(i grew up speaking a Bavarian dialect)
Nope
Home clothes = no clothes
Sure
Usually pajama-style clothes
Comfy, soft, ugly
I'm also barefoot 90% of the time at home
Socks are only for shoes and house shoes only for when it's really cold
Yoga pants, my husband's worn t-shirt
for winter time you got a cozy dressing gown ;)
Radetzky March
One of the most well known military marches in austria, it's even played on our national day, as well as at the big new year's concert every year
Many consider it an unofficial national anthem
In some countries of the former austro-hungary it is better known as "march of executioners" or "march of death".

I barely play any european country if it aint given, but if I have to Germany or France, if the countries have stats (like eg health or battle tactics) I’ll go with the better one
Apparently it's "Pfaffenschlag bei Waidhofen an der Thaya". 35 letters
a name you will say to anyone if you listen carefullyyyy
Out of curiocity, are those towns close to each other
Or did its founders just think "we're in Slovenia, there's hills
let's go with it".
Do all these things still exist there
Have they ever existed
The hallow of the white hazel, the rapid whirlpool, the chruch of St
Tysillo and the red cave
I looked it up on wikipedia and apparently it's a reference to the whirlpools in the section of the Menai Strait called *the Swellies*, which is just a mile down the road
The red cave thing was stolen from another parish about a 100 miles away though
Thanks for explaining

But yeah
i've always wanted to visit vilnius, and lithuania in general

Last summer I saw a very old campervan with Irish plates stop in a back street in a tiny village in Burgenland and to this day I have no clue why
Icelandic plates in rural Austria was really weird
Especially because the car wasn't that special, just some regular Golf that you can easily rent for little money

You can see that regularly in Vienna, the often park close to the harbor
Russian plates always are a bad omen
Best to park your car, get a coffee and make sure that the Russian is far away before you get going
Met Russian cars twice on the road, both times I narrowly abvoided an accident
First time the driver went off his line, second time she almost pressed me down into a ravine when I tried to overtake them (driving 30 where 100 was allowed) and she suddenly started driving in the middle of the road
Butter has nearly no lactose and you're not eating a big portion of it in one go, so it should be fine even for lactose intolerant people
Butter + soy sauce is an awesome flavour combination, by the way
Also Klammeraffe ist für mich ein Heftgerät
Ja, i habs als kind für das heftgerät gehört und erst viel später hab ich von dem Primat erfahren
Daher ist meine erste Assoziation anders ;)
"schnabel" would be german for "beak" (like a ducks beak)
For me it's confusing, that snabel is a trunk xD
Well, usually we cheer against a certain neigbhour country
Well i don't follow football but i cheered for England while i was in England
I usually root for Germany if Austria is knocked out
Austrian here cheering for my beloved northern neighbour, love you, Germany, go get em
Grosso
Grosso
GROSSO
Can confirm, hate Germany for no reason too
We hate you cuz you are too similar
How dare you reject nuclear energy
How dare you refuse to pay with card
How dare you not allow google street view
I'm the only Austrian I know who cheers for Germany when Austria inevitably fails at football
Not that I'm much of a football fan, but in general I like you well enough, neighbor
And then pigs would fly, hell freeze over and the world would end
The taste of tap water in Belgium
I really missed the water quality of Vienna
French coffee – weak as the Maginot line
I even got a lot of that in Sussex, but tbf it was a bit hippie-ish in that area
Worse, they put bread in their coffee
A few years ago I was in Bratislava on New Years Eve
The inner city was completely full of British tourists vomiting and fighting
Not what I expected at all
"Pregame" in English
And „vorsaufen“ in Austrian
still big
mind you I'm saying that as somebody from a village with 200 inhabitants, and the next town of 20k people being 40 minutes away
I don't mean ladyfingers artfully dunked into coffee and slathered with mascarpone
I mean regular baguette with butter and jam on it which is then dunked into a bowl of coffee and eaten sopping wet
>Many cultures have a quiet Sunday, but I don't think anyone takes it as seriously as we do
Austria is even worse
No shops, not even groceries are open on Sundays
~~even worse~~ equally sensible
...nothing in particular, I guess
&#x200B;
In a way I'm glad they exist, and that European countries in general are relatively small on average comapred to the rest of the world, just because not everything needs to be huge like China, India, US, Canada etc
&#x200B;
Some of them have extensive intriguing history ofc
&#x200B;
Vatican especially, plus great tourist target, plus still something noteworthy in the diplomatic world even when many people don't care about religion nowadays
&#x200B;
And since nobody else mentioned it, lets not forget the Order of Malta, as the only territory-less "country" that is still officially recognized by others
As probably some people never even heard of it, quick summary:
Religious group of ca
15K official members over the world, plus more hired people and volunteers
Maintain a curious diplomatic status as being recognized as country by over 100 other countries (many others not, but still), have their own passport system, laws, number plates, etc
Members are usually citizens of their home country too, not only of the order alone
Public activities are mostly humanitarian help for catastrophes and war areas, and regular ambulance and/or hospital services in some parts of the world
I like them
They almost always have a specific reason why they are what they are and that makes them rather unique imo
And they should return to or debut at Eurovision
San Marino's back is hurting from carrying the honour of the microstate status year after year
Indifferent; very rarely amused by their government structure (dukes and princes) and/or annoyed by the fact that they're all fucking tax havens
Liechtenstein was basically an appendix of the Austrian empire for the longest time
When that stopped being the case it was kind of considered not okay anymore to wildly annex any neighbor you see fit without consequences
Also they don't border Germany
Haha the comment I looked for
Slovenia is so weird to define in these terms
It was part of the Austrian duchy (or duchies at times) for  a thousand years while still retaining elements that put it into the "Balkans" category - the biggest being a member of the failed Yugoslavist project
As such it is grouped as part of Central, Central-Eastern, Southern and South-East Europe
And for the Americans Eastern Europe
But that definition is weird
At the end it shows that geographical monikers are fuzzy to the point of irrelevance
Yugoslavia is often counted as part of the Eastern bloc and thus allocated to Eastern Europe (especially in the Anglo American context iirc)
Its a bit reductive and misleading imo but so are most regional definitions
Yuuuuuup
So much yuuuuuup
I especially love the American post ww1 maps where croatia-slovenia is labelled Bosnia or Czechia stretches to the alps
Geographical knowledge: About nil
I think you could ask us austrians how well assasinating a high ranking official goes
I am not a fan of Iran, but you can't just kill everyone of your enemies, especially since you aren't at war
Imagine how the Us would react if another country it is not at war with, shot a missile at the US killing Pence
Instant declaration of war
Sadly that's what I think will happen, because that was an open act of War without a declaration of war
I know, Soleimani caused many deaths, but still, you can't just assasinate him
Also Trump often predicted that Obama would declare War on Iran to be reelected
Nice Irony
... the cynic part of my brain thinks how convenient it is, starting something that could Lead to a war  or fights for us troops (on foreign soil,  not in the usa) with the upcoming elections and then the voters have to rally behind the orange guy and vote for him
And convenient oil
And i am really skeptic believing the reasoning and thinking about the weapons of mass destruction, that where the reason for another war for the us, but never existed
How can a self proclaimed first world country react in such a way and not in a diplomatic way
If they are sure he was responsible for the ambassy fire
It looks like some wild West, shoot first, ask after behaviour and nothing how a modern Nation should behave
And afaik nobody was killed at the ambassy,  but it is the reason for assasination
In what world is this ok
Even if its true and he was responsible
Imagine: the second in command of another Nation .... lets for a simple example choose maybe norway
is believed responsible for planning an attack on an ambassy, for example of    serbia
Would serbia react with an assassination
And for the unreal case it would
there would be a massive outcry all over
I am sure they would choose the diplomatic way
It is not ok for the usa in behaving this way
And it looks really like a Bully would act
I should buy shares of US "defence" corporations
Wasn't this guy and his force sort of keeping ISIS in check
Issue an ultimatum
Trust me
I doubt they'd risk an all out war with the US
They will most likely try to pressure others by raising oil prices in the region or making its export harder
So the world stopped formerly declaring wars in recent times and in the US only formal war has to be sanctioned by the us
So the last few presidents have often send troops and basically acted in "warlike" fashion without it beeing war
Is there any discussion in the us about that, if that is a weakening of the congress or if the president should have the power to make such decisions
Or is the country at large fine with it
Iran already can't export their pistachios to europe because of sanctions
In reality because my last call today was with a nice serbian guy and i wrote my reply on the way home after the call
But with historic context i can say: what happened then was wrong and austrias reaction was wrong and look what happened after, because some people thought it more important to be the though country and retaliate with so much over the top force to prevent to be seen as weak
And the lives and wellbeeing of the normal people where not important
I really hope we learned from our past mistakes
....and somebody could see some similarity to the situation then and now
overreaction, destabilization because of self importance, hurt pride and the need to be seen as strong to overcompensate for insecurity
hopefully not as many dead people as then, but its an exponential escalation and i fear many people will die after it
Thanks for the clarification
The Irak war is over, or am i wrong
And they did not try to capture him for a trial, like a civilized country would
>attack on our embassy
That "attack" where some people outside of the embassy were loud, but didn't even enter the embassy
Stop believing your media brainwashing
Mossadegh was an ineffectual leader and a Kremlin asset
Also it was France&Britan that toppled the Shah with Khomeini (who lived in France) because he stood up for Iran
Don't believe the propaganda
Javid Shah
Iran used to do exactly that in the 1970s and they might go back to it if they feel threatened enough / backed into a corner
There will be attacks for sure, question is if they'll only be against US/British/Israeli/Saudi government targets or against the civilian public as well
Experience tells me: Germany or Turkey
Currently
Russia
It would have to be an equivalent force to the combined armed forces of the EU, so Russia really seems like the only candidate who could in the first place
Well, let me guess
Germany again
Nah
Probably not
Turkey
Maybe
Not sure
Russia
Probably not

Economy colonialism, very likely

Hell yes

[It takes a Russian to take down a Russian…]
I knew it
Didn't stop you before, and you didn't even have cars or planes back then :P
It was, even if a majority was for it, it was still a foreign military marching over the borders of a sovereign state with the intention of occupying it
If that's not an invasion, I don't know what is
It's not 1938 my friend, the reaction would be quite the opposite now
Oh no
A GRAMMAR NAZI *slowly runs away* ^woosh^woosh^woosh
Three times the charm
Well
You're not a Commie (thinking emoji)
I totally can't tell it from your Username *whistling*
No, we dont have that here unfortunately
If you go out to eat traditional food you have to be prepared to spend a lot of money
If you want cheap food, then you have to eat kebap
Well, there are *Buschenschänke* or *Heurige* and they fit the description quite well actually
They are only allowed to sell their own produce (so it's regional), it's typical, simple Austrian food (cheese, sausages, ham, pickled veggies) and it's really cheap so that farmers and the like can get their calories at an affordable price
Now I'm not talking about the bastardisations in Vienna that cater to tourists and are 5 or 10 times as expensive, those (while not necessarily bad in quality) have very little to do with it all
there are lots of places you can buy cheap schnitzel
Schnizelhaus, schnitzelwelt, schnitzelwirt,...
they just aren't as good as the real thing coming from a good restaurant
They are far from cheap though and mostly for tourists and people making day trips or drinking wine in the evening
When was that, the 1950s?
Unfortunately, Grinzing has degraded to a kitschy tourist village
You won't find many Viennese people there anymore
The Heurigen are still a thing though, but their main purpose was never to feed people, but to provide snacks to go along with the new wine (=Heuriger)
Buschenschanken and Heuriger are for hikers etc
though
Such cafeterias as OP asks about are places in the city where you get a menu for a few euro, usually frequented by students and people on their lunch break (or typically single men who want a warm dinner without cooking themselves)
Its like a small place in the third district where you could have a schnitzel and a potato salad for three euro
But their main purpose is not to provide people with food, but to serve snacks to make them drink more
This is correct
Nothing in Vienna's 19th district (which Grinzing is a small part of) is cheap
Ok i didn't see OP asking for places specifically in the city
That would be a bit different indeed
Buschenschänke/Heurige were not invented for hikers though, those just started frequenting them because they were typically alongside their routes, and serving good portions for the money
Well, in the city we have Würstel-Döner-Hotdogstände instead
Don't know which places you've been to but the ones I'm talking about serve platters for 5 or 6 euros which i wouldn't be able to down a shot afterwards for fear of exploding
My point is that Heurigens are places to drink wine, mainly, because they are run by people making the wine
It's not what OP was talking about, even if you can get good cheap food there
don't know about *great*, but definitely catchy: [Seiler & Speer - Ham kummst]
almost all EAV songs
The problem is: their texts are so great, but non-German-speakers won't understand them
: [Märchenprinz] [Küss die Hand, schöne Frau]
How about [this] Italian song made in Austria by a Georgian who you'd think is Russian
Fuerstenfeld, a cult classic
I dare you to not tap your foot to the chorus, when the bassline kicks in:
&#x200B;
More recently, Wanda have been consistent with their good music
They are Austrian, but love Italy:
"Herr Komissar" by Seiler und Speer is overall just a great song, it deserves some attention
and on a less serious note, more or less, we all love songs like these after a bit too much Jägermeister
Pretty sure "Der Komissar" was very famous, Austria's first chart #1 in the US since Mozart
>Its in German and i wouldn't blame you if you couldn't tell
Hah
I knew it would be 'Vo Mellau bis ge Schoppernou' :D
Edith: vorarlbergian "Grammar"
Very enjoyable
I only now by reading your post realized, that the artists don't have to be from one's country
>Austria's first chart #1 in the US
Nope
That'd be *Rock Me Amadeus*.
000 öS = about 1
000 €, or about 2
000 € of today's money considering 30 years of inflation
A 1000 Schilling bill was blue(ish)

>doesn't sound too good
"Lesbische schwarze Behinderte", "Schilddrüsenunterfunktion" or "Kapitalismus" are also great ones - but I like his music in general
Apparently "Saufen" got covered a lot, including some Ballermann-Style versions that seem to not get the sarcasm at all
STS in general have a ton of great songs and translated covers
Welp, guess my citizenship has just been revoked
Also, it was a heavily bastardized version of *Rock Me Amadeus*.

Come on, when has an Austrian expat in Germany ever gone wrong
Edit: thank you kind stranger
Why, thank you
I very much love the UK and I'd love the idea of a swap, but you wouldn't learn much German in Austria, non of us speak it :D
Haha, we do speak, or, at the very least, mumble
There are a number of quite distinctive dialects which technically are all but a couple variations of bavarian or low German as I think it's called
Towards the cities it tends to blend into some sort of standard German, but in the countryside the accents are often quite thick
So much so that a person from the far west of the country (Vorarlberg) would struggle a lot to understand a person from the far east (Burgenland) and vice versa
And we're only talking some 500km distance here
It's got a lot to do with our topography, being separated by mountains influences speech and other parts of our culture a lot
Haha yeah, i must say, watching "Peaky Blinders" and hearing brummy for the first time was eye-opening to say the least
Love meself a good dialect, it really adds depth to people's talk
German dubs usually avoid any strong accents
Maybe in a comedy or satire for added effect
"Schummelzettel", which literally means cheat sheet
Austrians (and parts of Germany) call it "Schummelzettel". Same meaning
>No idea where švinglc comes from
I think it may be related to German "schwindeln" which means to cheat
Or just „Schummler“
Is Spickzettel (glance sheet) a thing in Austria
It certainly was in Germany where I grew up
I don't think Spickzettel is that widely used as a word, Schummelzettel is definitely a lot more common
There's also Schwindelzettel
Similarly, the act of cheating in exams is usually referred to as schummeln rather than spicken
Was it a Texas Instruments calculator
We had to use those for school, and quite a few people wrote their cheat sheets into the inside of the cover
We had lockers
But instead of using them for food we put in stuff like a tea kettle
Our books we just left at home - nobody used them anyways
We had them in high school, but nobody ever used them instead we just left all our books on the desks in our classroom
We have lockers in the hallway for our clothes, though they're used less and less the older students get, and cupboards in the back of the classrooms for all our books and stuff
In my school, we have lockers in the hall for your shoes, jackets, valuables and stuff like that
I never saw anyone put books in them, for those we had a row of small cabinets in the back of the classroom, like those ikea shelfes but with doors
So in my school in austria, we didn't have lockers
However there were shelves in the back of the class where everyone student got a spot to store their books
There were also some lockers you could rent
I  believe my school now has lockers for everyone
Edit: Also most classes are in the same room, just some have special class rooms (music, arts, physics, biology and chemistry)
So you can also leave the stuff you don't need on your desk
The teachers switch between the class room
And the classrooms get locked afterschool, so I just took the stuff I needed to study home with me
In Austria it‘s dependent on the school
Primary schools typically don‘t. Middle schools typically do and higher education varies
Out of the three major schools I know one has lockers (the one with the most students)
„Higher education + middle school“-schools would usually have lockers
Depends on the school
My kid's school has got some, thankfully
In primary school (ages 6-10) no, we just used backpacks and the small compartment under the desk
It wasn't really an issue sinc3 we only had a couplensubjects and 4-6 hours a day
In gymnasium/highschool (ages 10-18) we are given the key to one at the beginning of the year
However every class also had a cupboard with little square compartments the perfect size for slotting textbooks into
Each student was given one, and most use it for everything except for some of the bulkier stuff like arts and crafts materials etc
Might also be important that teachers come to the classroom and not the other way around except for specialized classrooms for chemistry, biology, or crafts
We didn't have them either
But our system may be different than yours
We didn't have to carry our books around all day because for most classes the teachers came to our classroom, we didn't have to leave
And for the few classes we did have somewhere else than our designated classroom, we could just leave our books in little cubbies underneath our desks in the main classroom and just take the material for that one class with us
My friend and desk mate left all her books in a backpack hanging from her desk the whole shool year and only took home the subjects she had homework or a test in
Yes
We took it out during breaks and used it to make tea and instant coffee
Worked very well
Million = 10^6  = 1 000 000
Milliarde = 10^9  = 1 000 000 000
Billion = 10^12 = 1 000 000 000 000
Billiarde = 10^15 = 1 000 000 000 000 000
Trillion = 10^18 = 1 000 000 000 000 000 000
Trilliarde = 10^21 = 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
Quadrillion = 10^24  = 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
All over Austria there are things called "Erdstall", for which there is no translation apparently
They are more or less just holes in the ground, some barely fit a grown up human, others are many meters long but almost none of them allow to stand upright
We know rather little about them as far as purpose goes, we do know that they have been built over the course of at least the past 1000 years, maybe longer
Their high time was between 1000 and 800 years ago
It is suspected that they could have served as mystic places, or maybe they were simply hideaways during times of war and pillageing
Possibly both, possibly neither, we can't be sure as there are barely any traces of artefacts that would explain further why they exist
There are catacombs below many churches but mostly just in the basement
Stephansdom has a more extensive system, but still not as big as paris's
Graz has an air raid shelter network under the castle hill "Schlossberg".
I went there during a guided city tour in elementary school, we emerged from it inside the clocktower
The neighbouring town where I grew up had an coal mine (an old shaft mine, not an open pit mine) and the Nazis added tunnels to it for storage
A problem is that does additional tunnels were undocumented, the town had an problem with an public building sinking because of an cave in of such storage tunnel
First time I'm hearing about this
Actually, under the inner city and parts of the 2nd district, they go as far as 6 levels underground
Some of those cellars are still open to the public, for example the 12 Apostelkeller or the Eszterhazykeller
Famous for not starting any World Wars and Beethoven
Most aistrians would say something about having a rich history culture and cuisine, but I'm just going to add, that of all of the alcohol consumption were to me meassured in pure alcohol, austria would have the highest alcohol consumption worldwide
We started two world wars
We got you covered with the other one
Well well, as an Austrian I can only say: The two of us are Pinky and Brain
And us Austrians have the same love-hate relationship
But somehow we get along with you, Pinky

No, and I've never seen that happen once
I believe here in Vienna even the bus drivers would be weirded out if you did that, but I guess I'll try it next time
Well yes but actually no, some do it some don't, but nobody really cares, so i wouldnt consider it a custom
I sometimes see people saying "Wiederschauen", which means as much as "Goodbye", to the busdriver, when exiting through the front door
I usually do it myself
It is quite frankly ridiculous of a company to cave in like that
I would say I'd boycott their stuff but I don't play any of their games anyhow

Fair enough
What stinks of China's pressure is the sheer excess with which they punished player and casters
China wanted an example and Blizzard gave it to them for that sweet sweet chinese mobile market money
Just underlined my decision to never buy one of their games again
Riot put out an official statement that they do not care wheter the casters call them HKA or Hong Kong Attitude
So who else did blizzard ban for ... Idk ... Speaking out against the US or Russia for example
Just because *we live in a society* doesn't mean people can't take a stance
Last time I checked, no hardware manufacturer spoke out against/sanctioned the Hong Kong protests in may way
This is not about "evil China" (and even less about average Chinese corporations) but how Blizzard makes themselves a lackey of their political agenda

Plot Twist: Czechia is the dick
When I was a kid, I always thought Austria kinda looks like a guitar
It pisses me off
Kurds should get their own state
Also, quite a dick move from Trump to abandon their former allies
Its a blatant scapegoat play by Erdogan who wishes for nothing more than Kurds, ideally the PKK personally, retaliating on turkish soil
If he can play up the “savior of Turkey“ spiel he'll get votes
I will admit I am not very informed about the situation
Maybe I'm being naive here but to play devil's advocate: I can somewhat see Turkey's point of view
They have become fed up with the chaos at their borders and since USA or NATO won't clean up, they are finally doing it themselves
But from the Turkish perspective, a strong, inofficial Kurdish state right in their backyard is obviously not in their geopolitical interest for a multitude of reasons
I don't see why Turkey shouldn't do so:
* The region is still in chaos and under dubious legal status
* A strong Kurdish presence represents a potential danger to Turkish territorial integrity
* The big dog USA currently has a weak, idiotic, and easily manipulated president
* It is a good opportunity to attempt unite the politically divided Turkish people
Even when native German speakers get the pronunciation and the accent right in English, the last hurdle is usually the pitch
German is pretty flat, whereas English is more up and down
So all their words individually might be "right", but when you string them together into speech something's off
It drives me mad, you already put all of that work into your accent and that's the one thing you don't notice
So yeah
Unless someone really worked hard we obviously can tell that they're non-natives
If their accent is really good I might be unsure whether that's an odd local dialect from a region I'm not familiar with - but that's rare
> why does everyone always keep insisting on translating everything literally
Don't go to /r/de
They call reddit "lases", because reddit comes from "read it", so the German translation would be *lases*
We bite the grass
We straighten our slippers
We put the feet up
One thing that's unique about austria is that we are the only country in the world where skiing is considered a national sport
Second thing which I thought could be pretty unique is that our economy relies on both industry and tourism a lot
Although we are not a typical tourism country i believe 10% of economic performance comes from tourism and also we have many very (internationally) succesful companies
and i thought French are weird with their 4 times 20 :D
> 4) Gun and ammunition control is ridiculous, but we still don't have as many gun crimes as other European nations
Check out Austria and Czechia
Here in Austria every adult has the right to own a handgun for self defense at home
Still less gun crime than most of our neighbors
> ...maybe the preference for carbonated water is unique to here
No it's not
Most of Germany's "unique" traits and behaviourisms like that are shared by Austria I think
Except the towel thing
I don't know any other country than the US that also widely allows citizens to carry guns
> Pagan traditions are engrained deep in Catholicism
That alone is not that unique actually
That is something that has happened to Catholicism in particular, and to all kind of religions all over the globe, since forever
Exhibit A: Christmas
Exhibit B: any Latin American country
Exhibit C: Krampus
But I suppose how all that plays out in Lithuania is very one of a kind
Thats not unique to Germany
Yeah I have already heard that from a few Greek friends
I just added to your sentiment that gun ownership rate and gun crime don‘t necessarily relate
If we're counting Austrian Dialect I'd say [Seiler & Speer - Principessa] and [Pizzera & Jaus - Liebe zum Mitnehmen]
The standard German song that comes to mind is [Mark Forster - Übermorgen]
that song was so annoying - a nightclub special
Vorarlberg - the whole country is speaking bavarian dialect, Vorarlberg is speaking allemanic
Vorarlberg
They are separated from the rest of the country by a mountain chain, are the only ones who do not speak Austro-Bavarian German, don't even know where other major Austrian cities are half of the time and are always blushing when Liechtenstein and Switzerland look their way
After WWI, they even held a referendum whether to join Switzerland or not
Also Burgenland because there are 2 names for each village/town
(German/Slavic)
Ja, und wir sind stolz drauf
Also it appears you have a horrible violent crime problem and only one detective to solve everything
Or so I have gathered from the Wallander series
>low German influence
low German
Niederdeutsch
Like in Northern Germany
I dont get what you want to say
Vienna has Lower Austria though, so the borders are afaik way more fluent than with Vorarlberg and Tyrol
At some point in history, it was meant to become a Slavic corridor between northern and southern slavs
To this day, there's a Croatian minority (and also a Hungarian one) in this area
Well, there are towns with three to four official names
For example:
> Oberwart (hungarian: Felsőőr, croat: Borta, romani: Erba) is a city
As taken from Wikipedia

[Melissa Naschenweng] is a close second imo, just (thankfully) less well known
What about [the guy who sings about dumplings from Thüringen]
Thats from austria
Thanks for making him another Austrian people believe to be German, don't mind this one either :)
First he is Austrian and second it can't qualify if it's purely satirical
And he is actually still successful
And kinda underrated:
hooly, I haven't heard that song in ages
forgot it even existed
thank you for bringing up some nostalgia with it
You mean like Corona
Guilty pleasure song tho
Ischgl intensifies
Where you in Schladming
I'ts even worse there because it's his hometown
I mean I THINK they are meant to be taken sarcastically, but the fact that they tried to get into the Eurovision song contest makes me doubt that
Because they're singing in Austrian dialect, nobody, except Austrians and maybe Bavarians, would've understood anything
Do you hear it too
It's kinda different from country to country and the age moving out varies
Some move out already during high school, others move out when they go to university (e.g. in students dorms) and again others move out as soon as they begin to work and earn their own money
I moved out when I was 18
When I had sex at home before that, we just had the TV or music running
> Are the houses built differently
Yes
We built much more massive with a bigger emphasis on quality  and durability
No wood + drywall
It's usually brick and mortar or concrete
What some Americans consider houses would be garten sheds in some European countries
Same here in Austria
> We have an airport without a flight plan that is just barely in use and fund it with 8 million Euros ...
Sounds cheap compared to BER
I don't like it
I think it's generic, inoffensive and boring
Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser was way better
Also it's soooo slow
IMO it sounds ok when a big orchestra plays it, but if you don't have that bandwith of instruments it's just horrible
The melody that Germany stole is much better
Can't we just switch it to "i am from austria" or some new version of the emperor-anthem (after we sued germany for stealing it of course)
pls no anschluss 2
0 in WWIII
You also changed the original text of it
Give us back our anthem or we
, keep making fun of you, <insert evil laughter>
And the lyrics can be basically summed up with "our country is beautiful and we are good at stuff".
Yes, like the Italian or French anthem
"Us vs Them" type anthems are the best
No, that song is nice and all but it was composed by Americans for an American audience and has little cultural or emotional meaning to Austrians themselves
Also, it doesn't really sound like an anthem to me
If it were up to me, I'd take away the German anthem, which is actually a bastardized version of the [Kaiserhymne] the old Imperial Austrian anthem, and make it ours again (with more topical lyrics, of course)
Of course, nationalism, irredentism and pan-whatever-ism were all the rage in the 19th century
The multi-ethnic Habsburg empire was stylized as the #1 bad guy in Europe while overseas millions of non-Europeans were indiscrimitely slaughtered and enslaved
For the life of me I can't remember where I read that, but there was a statistic what country's anthems focus on and it was like:
* 24% Our people best people
* 24% Our military best military
* 24% Our land best land
* 24% Our flag best flag
* 4% Other
I said "if it were up to me" but it's not, so I guess you can keep it
This land is my land is my favorite actually singable US alternative anthem xD
3-6 depending on the season
Jonagold, Breaburn and some green ones Are now available
Too bad Kronprinz Rudolph is only available for a short time
Isn't that the main difference between Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd? Süd being the one which has the big stores and Nord having smaller stores
[Would fit into their country division, too] (in German, but the relevant information is understandable)
Fucking love Pink lady
That makes sense
Was wondering because Hofer usually has big stores but Hofer is a part of Aldi Süd afaik
[Egg harps]
Everyone has one, nobody ever uses it
Seems like they're not very common in other places
[Some cups or plates from Gmundner Keramik]
Probably some "hand-me-downs" from parents/grandparents but I think a lot of households have a few items
Not my country, but the only place I‘ve ever seen flat toasters is Denmark
And in Norway mellomleggspapir – a piece of bread sized paper, that you put in between sandwiches when you transport them
I don't know if [Spätzlehobel] are a staple anywhere except Austria and Southern Germany ...
You might be right - I think the Hungarian one is more intense than what you can get here, eventhough the most famous brandname is "Kotányi", so it implies it's Hungarian
My grandma uses them for fruit salad and ice cream
Often ice cream on top of fruit salad
> Crampons
I remember when I went there how shops had signs outside reminding you to take them off when going inside
But I could totally see why you would want to wear them, it was often times icy as fuck
Came here to see this
It’s an institution in itself, never seen a single household without it
In Austria too
Not in that amounts thow
It is open on the bottom
Almost 50 now and still resisting
Adulthood *and* Gmundner Keramik
While we are talking English ... Who the fuck came up with "hurdy gurdy"? That's such a ridiculous name for an instrument and sounds like it was invented by a drunk toddler
In German it's called Drehleier (turning lyre) which in contrast actually makes sense (because it's quite literally a lyre where you crank/turn a handle)
In Austria, we use 'Sackerl fürs Gackerl' for the bags to pick up dog-"waste". It literally means 'baggie for the shittie', and non-Austrian German speakers will burst into laughter here
Austrian collicual speech has a funny preference for dimunitives
The German language likes to makes nouns connecting their purpose with "Zeug" (thing)
Feuerzeug - fire thing - lighter
Flugzeug - flight thing - plane
Werkzeug - work thing - tool
Spielzeug - play thing - toy
That name came about because on the piano you can play both soft and loud, whereas on its predecesor, the cembalo (harpsichord), every note you played was the same volume no matter how hard you pressed the key
I think it's cute
But it's true, sometimes I can't take Swiss German seriously because of that
We have lots of jokes about that, like your word for condom is "Verhüterli" (which I know it really isn't) and stuff like that
Although to be fair that expression was deliberately created by a PR agency
It's "Blinker" in German as well
no that's bork
nah, that's the mobile phone communication standard
if anything, we would have to call them UMTS or LTE now, and nobody does that
I exclusively say Telefon when talking about my mobile,always did
Weird
I know right
You should start
Personally, I use the -erl diminuitive heavily
I also use other typical Austrian diminuitives like -tscherl, -tschi, -i etc
but very sparsely the Standard German diminuitive -chen
Sackerl is a classic, one of the first words every Germanspeaker from outside learns when they move to Austria
Because they ask in every shop "Sackerl dazu
". And saying "Tüte" is just absolutely not a thing here
Tüte is either an ice cream cone, or a marihuana cigarette (however the latter usually is also diminuitized as "Tüterl")
What is Sackerl in Swiss
Tütli
Maybe it's more of an Austrian thing
I say Telefon almost exclusively as well
Sometimes a Handy slips in but it's the exception rather than the rule
My dialect is way too far gone to even consider calling a handy/smartphone "Telefon" non-sarcastically
Most people I know call it handy without a second thought
"Wos darad ma ohne handys
" or "Duas handy weg
" for example
Could very well be
-sent from my Telefon
Maybe a mixture
I grew up with landline too and didn't have my first mobile until age 20 or so, but I can see your reasoning and it's probably correct for many
Oh poor busted me xD
that's entirely true
As a native German speaker I perfectly understood the last sentence
There are commas-rules where we put thousands of commas in one sentence
Yeah I tend to not use any commas at all in English
That's quite different to German
In Austrian German its really weird, because a "the" in front of a name is completely wrong in written Austrian German, but normal in spoken Austrian German
Not using a "the" in front of a name is really weird in a spoken sentence, but normal in written
You say 50 dollar too
Not dollars
Dollars are single bills
Actually, it's van Go*coughingfit*
Yeah I wasn't sure about that, thats why I was only talking about Austria
Aren't there a few regions in Germany were they never put an article in front of a name
A subtle difference but one a native speaker would indubitably notice
Just yes, really
Hungarian is ... hard
Hard and weird
Totally missed that
Nice joke lmao
We know
It's definitely more civilized than the Austrian one
Granted, the way a lot of things are done in the UK parliament are archaic (like the "ays" and "noes"), but all in all they still have a level of politeness
In Austria, MPs have called each other "peasant twerp", "the one with a behavioural disorder", "lousy creature" or - my favorite-:
"You are exactly the one head short where your brain should have been"
While some of these insults were made during speeches, a lot happens in interjections by MPs that are supposed to just listen to the one speaking
Last year a conservative MP interjected: "You're not in Bosnia, we have rules here
" to a MP who was born in Bosnia
Honestly I think it's rather civilised in comparison
At least they got some etiquette
And when Blackford called May a liar he was immediately asked to take it back or to be removed from the session
In Austria a politician can call union people male genitalia and the speaker doesn't even react
> But you're right
They are more rowdy than in other countries
Except perhaps Ukraine, where I know for a fact, there has been a least two fist-fights involving more than 3 MP's in the last 10 years
[Meanwhile in Kosovo]
There's another version of this, where they also show Vitaly Klitschko - he abstained from fighting, because he thinks that they should make politics with their heads, not their hands
Maybe they're just so used to tear gas at that point, that they've created some kind of immunity
We "go sex"
I secksed ur mum
But you don't often add the tun (doing) to that
Those are stand alone verbs like 'to fuck'
Poppy seeds are used the exactly same way as in Czechia, unsurprisingly
Food
Interesting sidenote: I went to Bolivia, everyone there chews coca leaves, but poppy is illegal (even for cooking) and many people don't even know what it is
We use a lot of poppyseed in traditional dishes
Also, the flowers are really pretty
There is a traditional use for poppy as a tranquillizer for infants though (when they cry uncontrollably), it's called "Mohnzuz" and as far as i can gather it's some sort of pacifier that's made from/with poppy seeds
I haven't heard of anyone using it for ages though
There is the alcoholic equivalent too, a "Mostzuz", which uses cidre
Mohnflesserl ftw
I'm with you
Mohn is best used sparingly
[Mohnzelten] Yeah, no thank you
>Hereitkuchen
The what
Haha
I had to google "flesserl - we call them Mohnweckerl in my neck of the woods
I only learned not too long ago, that Mohnflesserl with salt on it only appear to be common in my area (upper Austria) and not all around Austria
Only heard it because some guy (from Vienna) said that he didn´t know they existed until a branch of Leberkas Pepi opened in Vienna and sold them there
Yeah im a Lower Austrian living in Vienna and we don't put salt on our Mohnweckerl here - gotta try your variant out tho :D
Mohnflessal ghean ohne Soiz
If you like Leberkäse, then go to Leberkas Pepi in Vienna, afaik he has them
And his Leberkäse is really really good
(many different sorts of them)
Kommt drauf an: Wenn man damit Süsses isst, dann ohne Salz
Mit Leberkas oder wenn man damit was Deftiges isst: Dann ist es mit Salz verdammt gut
Nein, ich bin firmly Team salzlos
Aber ich mag auch keine Salzstangerln
Die mag ich ehrlich gesagt auch nicht so sehr
Aber auf Mohnflesserl ist das Salz gut
Passt, du kriegst die mit, ich krieg die ohne :D

And The books of Marx and Engels are often called "Blaue Bände" (blue volumes) since the most common compilation was published in blue covers
Girls in my School used to double every vowel and add a b in the middle to not be understood by us boys

The 2008 football EC group stage match vs germany
if austria won 1:0 instead of losing 0:1 austria would've advanced and eliminated germany at the same time at a euro cup played on home soil
austria would've finally had a football achievement that eclipsed 1978 cordoba
We don't demand such ludicrous shit from serbia after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and therefore don't have a reason to invade them
There was a priest who saved Hitler from drowning when he was a kid, imagine if he just didn't notice it
We have so much shit on our plate
Love your pick
that was a pretty embarrassing loss yes
I lived in the UK and yes they do
also on the sidewalk when two people first walk in the middle and then both get to the left side to avoid eachother
it's not just the UK, I noticed this in most countries with left side traffic that people will generally walk on the left

Nope, we say "das 17

I am not exactly sure about maximum prices for certain goods, but we have what is called "laesio enormis" and "Wucher" which are juridicial tools to void a contract which either means something is very overpriced or where someone is extorted or the desperation is abused
Laesio enormis ("Verkürzung über die Hälfte" "not being worth at least half of it") means that the thing you buy must at least be half of the value of the price (with certain exceptions)
Otherwise you can sue to void the contract or the seller has the opportunity to compensate to match the 50% of value
Wucher (usury) is more flexible when it comes to the misproportion of value/countervalue and it also focuses on extortion or abusing a weak position of the other person, his young age and therefore not being able of proper judgement, or special desperation and so on
It is a flexible system and it also is there to void a contract
It is one of those things, that if someone ever tells you the ‘Allies were the good guys’ or something, that in reply, you should tell them to fuck themselves
In reality, the Allies (especially the Soviet Union aka the second Mongol Empire) were just as bad as the Axis
The only difference is that they won
The Yalta Conference was disgusting
It was what ultimately divided Europe in half for nearly 50 years
Poland should have received the ‘square deal’ the Western Allies promised them, but instead the US and UK bent over for Uncle Joe’s cock
I blame FDR the most for this, since he was a very close friend of Stalin
Churchill, on the other hand, was the most respectable of the Big Three (not that that says much), and he was certainly less forthcoming to the Soviet Union and their demands
If it wasn’t for the US, Operation Unthinkable may actually have occurred (it didn’t mostly because of US opposition to it, isn’t that funny
), and the Soviet Union might not have gobbled up half of Europe after all
Oh well
The Allies were just as spineless and corrupt as the Nazis were
It wasn’t exactly the first time the Allies pretty much sold out an entire country to appease someone
You’d think that, you know, after the end of a large part of a conflict that resulted in the deaths of ~70 million people, that the ‘Allies’ would get together to resolve their differences and rebuild a devastated continent
Nope
Instead they erected a giant fence across half of Europe, from which no former Warsaw Pact country has completely recovered from yet, and then completely turned on each other
Got to love humanity, right
The fact we were basically not mentioned in the conference probably helped prevent us from being split like Germany
Honestly this is a common feature of many Eastern European nations when dealing with their communist legacy
Externalising the countries own collaboration or communist movement and faulting "Russia" as the single responsible historical actor
They are doing a post 1945 Austria in this regard
Roosevelt and Stalin were pretty great friends, as it happened
Definitely quite a few similarities between the two as well
They both also had a personality cult and ruled mostly through propaganda that made them look larger than life
Afaik most Americans did not even know their president of nearly 13 years had polio and was handicapped
Churchill was no hero either but at least he wasn’t as much as a puppet, unlike FDR
Out of the three he was the best by far
He was also of noble blood whereas Roosevelt and Stalin were of common peasant background (yes, the Roosevelt family was rich, but they still had not a drop of blue blood in their bodies
Quite frankly, they were rich paupers)
Poland wasn’t exactly ‘occupied’ between 1795 and 1918 either (at least not in the sense that is being implied), it simply ceased to exist (which is probably even more insulting than being occupied or a puppet state)
Oh, I’m definitely not defending the US or any of their presidents
Literally every US president has been a stuck-up pseudo-dictator who only ever gave a shit about the 1% richest of their population
I also cannot think of any US president (or even US politician period) who was of humble origin
Maybe Lincoln I guess (but he was pretty rich by the time he became president)
You know, I see a lot of parallels between French and Yank culture
Especially when it comes to both thinking their shit smells good and that they are ‘better’ than everyone else (although Americans are still much worse in that regard)
Well, chauvinism is very associated with France after all
Let’s not forget that the Treaty of Versailles was unfair and way too harsh
No country could have possibly paid the reparations that were asked of Germany due to Versailles
It was ultimately what paved way for the NSDAP in the first place
That’s what happens when you back a proud, but humiliated people in a corner
They eventually have enough and want to strike back
Can you really blame them
I would quite enjoy living nearby the sea, even if it means flooding Slovenia ;)

Do that many people in Danmark have a garden
Or are there prepared areas where people come together and plant trees there
Ah, I thought the people are planting them themselves
That wouldve been cooler
That would be [Zirbenlikör] or just "Ziabn", a liqueur flavoured with the cones of [a certain species of pine]
PS: tastes ... sweet and strongly of wood resin mainly
Very medicinal as well if you got a bad stomach or anything really ;)
Gin tonic with a slice of cucumber, crackin summer drink
Heck yeah, "Schliwo" is awesome :D
For Austria, i‘d rather say Schnaps
Either from apple, pear or plum
Everyone drinks it due to peer pressure, and dislikes it for its terrible taste
Every time someone puts a bottle of a selfmade one on the table they say „but this is a good one“. I automatically assume it will be a terrible mixture of petroleum and fruit
Almdudler is also very popular
80er Stroh, literally useable to kill of insects, tastes like death and misery and only used if you absolutely don't want to remember the last 7 years of your life
It's also the German word for distilled liquor
If I remember correctly Gin during that time was very pure alcohol and the poor drank it like water
It got so bad that London's poor were always drunk
Big fan of rosmary or basil in my gin, myself
I made elder flower gin just the other week, it's lovely with some orange
Yeah Zirbenschnaps is not a thing in my region, it's all about the pear schnaps
Kletzenbirn, baby
I'm not into neat liquor, but it can be alright, and I know plenty of people who savour it
Last time I checked, Almdudler is not a liquor
just import it, domestic plum spirits are called zwetschgenbrand
I missread it
I can't judge it very well, because of course like most others I've learned it passively over the years
Once you get over the weird spelling rules [(orthography)] I guess it's not too hard
On another note, I believe these weird dick-measuring contests over whose language is harder are stupid and pointless
Having grown up with a supposedly more complicated language doesn't make you more intelligent or the superior human being
For me it's not hard at all, but I know a lot of people who still struggle with pronunciation, spelling and grammar, even after 8-9 years of learning the language
I just got lucky, my dad forced me to study my vocabulary every evening, to get my spelling down and to read books in English with him when I was in middle school, otherwise I'd probably still be struggling like so many other people I know
I don't think there's a major language with easier grammar than English
Orthography is the biggest mess since French tho :)
As a nativ German speaking person
let’s put it that way, I struggle more with German rather than with English lol
I never learned anything at all, I just watched YouTube Videos in english since I‘m six and I now have really good spelling and grammar
As a non-native speaker, I agree with you
It seems people have a chip on their shoulder when it comes to English and for some reason  feel the need to assert their superiority by bragging how complicated their language is compared to it
What is a common thing on reddit that would never happen if reddit was Europe-only
Once Ive put on Facebook that I got a baby an MLM brigade came after me, it was insane
I think they are just more specific in their target group around here

I think we all know what I meant and you're only proving my point here
Uhm try being Austrian or Swiss on r/de
Not a big difference

Yes, it was all about losing my pregnancy weight, treating my body after a hard time or making lots of money during maternity leave
It was really creepy and annoying until I blocked everybody
Who is us
It's no problem at all in Austria
Same for me in Austria
Austrian - Wien
English - Vienna
Spanish – Viena
French – Vienne
Czech – Víden
Estonian – Viin
Hungarian – Bécs
Dutch – Wenen
Polish – Wieden
Fun fact: there ist a district in Vienna named Wieden
Not a city but a federal state: Carinthia vs Kärnten threw me off at first because all the other states are fairly similar to their austrian name, except this one
(Salzburg, Burgenland, Vorarlberg stay the same, Upper and Lower Austria aka Ober- und Niederösterreich which basically means the same, Vienna aka Wien, The Tyrols aka Tirol, and Styria aka Steiermark, but Steiermark deprived from the name Steyr so I get that one too
Carinthia is the only one that I don‘t get
>German cities
>Vienna
Hab' ich den Anschluss verpasst
Carinthia is Kärnten here
It's funny because Vienna has a district called Wieden
TIL der Bodensee ist Lake Constance in Englisch
Anybody know on who that name is based on
I‘m hella curious now
Give them to Switzerland, we have enough Alpine weirdos already
It's Donau for us in Austria and Germany
I actually started using mapy
cz because I wanted to be less dependent on google
There is Open Street Maps, an open source alternative that I use sometimes
Does it work for Austria
Edit: It does
Nice
Edit2: Wow this is site fantastic
Bergfex has a lot of hiking trails and the weather cast is pretty good too
Sure
There is a lot less on it though
Many shops and whatnot are missing, and street view simply doesn't exist
In czechia is pretty comparable to google maps, here it's just
Okay
I use [AnachB] for route finding
It is really good for public transport, walking and bikes and uses basemap
That would be like trying to stop smoking by changing from Marlboro red to Camel light
Well I have both an Android and an iPhone so I needed something that works on both
I mostly use maps for traffic related stuff (routes, public transport), and it seems to work very well in that area
Has all the Wiener Linien connections
And I don't really care about street view
Because both are big comic villain companies from America who steal your data

Lol i cant even remember commenting on this post, well it seems i had a few beers too much yesterday
I thought Britain = England + Wales
Ah, ok
Thanks for explaining
I think The Troubles lasting for 40 years are an indicator that it's a bit more complex than "England doesn't want to let go". Also looking at elections there's almost a perfect 50/50 split between British Unionists and Irish Republicans
Will be "fun" once Brexit is through
Huh
Never saw it like that
Was under the impression it related to being in favour of the Irish Republic in contrast to the British Monarchy
1 EUR = a litre of discount milk

Wow the french version is one of the worst dubs I've seen so far
You do realize "N" as a standalone letter is pronounced "eN"? So if you say it out loud it makes perfect sense
"eN ist für "eNdlich"
Obviously ... do you really think they make different translations for swiss and austrian german
We learn both but it depends on the school on when you learn which
I learned cursive in first grade primary, then switched school and the new class learned printed-like in first grade and cursive in second
So I personally only learned cursive
I find it crazy that Germans and Austrians regularly claim that they write cursive while they don't. Most ppl write some weird mix of 80% normal 20% cursive
Idk where they learned that
The ppl I went to school with do that too and I can only write pure cursive, because that's what we mainly learned
Exactly this is how it's done here as well
*Exactly* the same how it's done here and how it was for me as well
wtf which exotic school teaches cursive first
i thought first year print letters, second year cursive was universal
Which is normal
You find some "handwriting" for yourself
There's a few letters that you change, just because you get sloppier or adapt because you can never read them
Most people look at me weird when they take a close look at my signature because my "b" is still cursive and not printed-like
But I purposefully changed my r's and n's because they looked like v and u, respectively
Even cursive changed over time, I learnt it differently than my sister 5 years later, e.g. how you write a, o, t, r, etc
Now they're even closer to print letters
Read my comment about the intended learning process [a bit further up] some people are stricter in sticking to what they've been given, others deviate more – it's all fine and part of properly learning cursive
Like always, the Spanish know what's important in life and what's not
But that's how you properly learn cursive
First, you learn how to read and write print letters
Then, you learn a neutral base set of letter forms and the concept of joined writing, you train it for a few years, and then you are encouraged to create your own writing style from it through repeated usage
Back in school (Austria, early 90ies) we used [this set] which officially is called "Ausgangsschrift" (base font; writing from which to progress on to your own style) for that very reason
Colloquially it's just called "writing font", because that's what you use to write things by hand
A few years later they reformed it and now it looks even simpler, [like this]
It's important to note that it is *not* a a strictly defined set of letters that you have to adhere to for all of your life
I stopped writing my capital X's like in the example above sometime in fourth grade I think (I mean just *look* at them
The good thing is, nobody expects that, but the point is learning this base set of letters allows you to develop your own speedy writing style, that's hopefully (at least somewhat) joined-up (which is faster than printing your letters) and universally legible
When Anglos are all "cursive is so difficult, we don't need it anymore because We HAvE TaBleTS nOw", I think they are referring to their own fossilized and cumbersome system that they apparently clung to for a few decades too long (like the [Palmer method] or [D'Nealian] ugh those G's)
I wouldn't like cursive either if I thought *this* is what it was supposed to look like
Sure, let's chuck out 3,000 years of cultural achievements because pressing those buttons is so comfy yo
No seriously, I get the sentiment, but whenever I hear somebody from the "I don't need to write lots with my hands anymore, we do everything through apps now" crowd, I just can't fathom what their life must look like
So you seriously never scribble down notes in a meeting, or write a shopping list, or pen a message to your mum, or put some talking points on a whiteboard
If I had to do all those things in the narrow confines of some app I'd go crazy with how constricted it feels
And I'd feel so bad if I couldn't do it by hand at least somewhat legibly, and efficiently for more than half a sentence
Pen and paper are such a super super super low-level kind of tech: easy to manufacture, intuitive to write with and store, and allows for easy access to the information
I honestly would be scared for humanity if we gave up writing by hand just because for the past ten years Apple has been selling us tablets
Uhm, isn't that the whole point of writing in cursive
(Cursive as in normal "joined writing" mind you, not some special or archaic form; English seems to be peculiar in that it's lacking a proper term for it

most successful scam by far is the Sound of Music
People handing you a flower (usually a rose) or wanting you to take a picture with them, then demanding you pay them for it
Also asking for a signature and then a donation
Not as much tourists, but people trying to move to the city: People offering a fully furnished rental flat at a good price, but requiring you to transfer the first rent "in advance", then never contacting you again
Ticket sellers dressed up as Mozarts, they hawk you and act really aggressively
Beggars with really weird body deformities
Normally they are part of a beggar syndicate
Munich Oktoberfest:  be carful of servers who "self tip", aka not give your change back/give you too little back
Not every server does it but it does happen
The taxi scam happened to me multiple times the same day
I wanted to take a taxi back to my hotel from the mall of Istanbul and the driver wanted payment in advance - he did exactly as you said, I think I handed him a fifty and he switched it for a ten
I said sorry and handed him another twenty and he switched it out again, but this time I saw it
I started to argue with him and suddenly a guy came up to the car, opened the door and dragged me out of the car
I was way too scared to do anything, ask for my money back or even call the police
I eventually found a driver to take me back, who upon arrival switched out the notes too, but this time I just yelled at him that I was gonna call the police until he let me go
Never went anywhere without a native speaker after that
Everything in Hallstadt, I mean 200 gramms of salt for 13 Euros or Restaurants at the lakeside charging 27 Euros for a simple Schnitzel
That’s sweet of you
Istanbul is a gorgeous city and I’ve met many great people there so the rest of my stay was amazing
I'll eat the tentacles off of any cephalopod you serve me and i love octopus the most
Weirdly, i'm also really curious about the live ones
Such intelligent and alien creatures, it's fascinating
Calamari fritti is one of my childhood memories from vacations in italy
Loved it, still like it
octopus and squid
best things I ever ate when in greece
filled with goat cheese and bell peppers and I wouldn‘t need anything else
recommend 10/10
edit: and it‘s not the same everywhere
when I was in croatia it didn’t taste as good, sry friends
pretty normal thing to do, and we don't even have an ocean in this country
It‘s not something I see every day
Or anything I‘d see in Austrian cuisine at all (For obvious reasons
We don‘t have any kind of ocean bordering us
But if I go abroad it‘s not something I‘m weirded out by either
Aka I‘d totally eat it without being disgusted
Uff pulpo gallego is the best
I'd take a bath in the stuff
Lol I thought you were writing about eating live ones in the second paragraph, but then I luckily read the second sentence
Yeah sounds like you're on to something
Calamari
Ich dachte, das ist sehr beliebt in DE, no joke :0
Do you draw a line for types of fish too or do you est fish at all or
Just genuinely curious
So are pigs, and I have no problems eating those
>pulpo a la galiciana
This is *such* an Italian mistake, I love it
I was in Cantabria this summer and the amount of eucalyptus there is crazy
You literally see it in the landscape when you cross the border from Bizkaia to Cantabria, bc those poison green leaves start sprouting everywhere all of a sudden
I suppose planting them is banned in Euskadi
Armie Hammer, is it you
Vienna for the provinces
The provinces for Vienna
Otherwise really local
For example the Upperaustrians meme about the Mühlviertel (countrybumpkins) and especially the district of Rohrbach (countrybumpkins who kill you due to reckless driving)
Edit: some moodsetting for the Mühlviertel
As someone just 5 kilometers away from the Mühlviertel and as a native of the district Eferding (basically farmer central in the upperaustrian heartland) I prolly should also confess that we're also a bit countrybumpkiny
The Burgenland is the incest-joke region of Austria
> Mykonos kind of, due to most tourists being mindless party goers
"Es war der Wein von Mykonos "
Horrible German Schlager
Burgenland is the most stereotypically "redneck" region for me
I think Dialects are also a big meme potential, especially Wienerisch and Vorarlbergerisch
Well there's always Burgenland and Carinthia for memes
Also Amstetten
Aptly named
DieTagespresse always jokes about how nobody would care if we would give the Burgenland to Hungary as long as we could still drink the Wine
heilige makkaroni
Most of them are tbh
Also because it's the flattest region of Austria
And St
Pölten
A city you only visit to die there
Amstetten truly is Austrias sex dungeon
And not the fun consensual kind
Pas de Calais= strait of Calais (= Dover Strait)
About "can" - a lot of people actually can live (for a while) in the USA, but relatively few choose to
I probably could live/move there, but in general I'd treat it similar to moving to the UAE/Saudi Arabia/China/Iran/Japan
it might be nice and interesting to be an expat there for a while, but from what I've seen so far, I doubt that I would want to permanently move
Absolutely not
for like a year yeah why not
like you said, getting new experiences and influences sounds great
also would love to visit some of the national parks you have, it seems insane how much open, uninhabited space you have
I enjoy my lifestyle here
I would go if theres a work opportunity there for me, but as things are there is no reaspn to give up my comfortable life here
I am in the USA from time to time for business, and there are a few places I could imagine living in
Unfortunately, those are pretty expensive, so I would rather stay in Austria
Living 3-5 years in New York as a 20-something with a good enough income could be great - Boston and Seattle would be cool too
And I like the smaller college-towns
I wouldn't want to do it long term, because of the reasons everybody else mentions here
I have the experience that women are very private about it but once you are pregnant everything changes and women don't talk about anything else anymore with you
my mom got, and still gets every time, very graphic when describing the act of her giving birth to her first-born abomination, which is me, who destroyed her nether regions
my brother was apparently an angel
Yeah ofc, my mom told me a bunch of while she was pregnant with me and of when she was pregnant with my brother but sadly she‘s very forgetful
Or she just doesn‘t like talking bout it that much but usually people talk about it openly
We have a saying that goes "3 Bier sind auch ein Schnitzel" ("3 beers make 1 Schnitzel")
Linsen mit Knödel (lentils with dumplings) or goulash for me
If my mom baked and I‘m down I go with her apple pie, but mostly when I‘m sad I either don‘t eat at all or go with [Toffifee]
I think most people go with alcohol tho
Edit: I just now noticed you said „relax and enjoy“ at the end
Then I personally don‘t have one since I don‘t like alcohol and usually just cry in my bed
Most people would probably still go with alcohol
Das bisserl das ich esse, kann ich trinken auch
(The little bit that I eat anyways, can be drunk instead)

German adds -land to a few certain countries, but not to others
Idk what the system behind it is really
Greece = Griechenland (Greek-Land)
Russia = Russland (Russ-Land)
Belarus = Weißrussland (White Russ-Land)
Germany = Deutschland (German-Land)
Switzerland = Schweiz (here it's vice versa lol)
Estonia = Estland (Estonian-Land)
Latvia = Lettland (Latvian-Land)
also
Austria = Österreich (Eastern Realm)
France = Frankreich (Frankish/French Realm)
Most other countries are pretty similar to the English spelling, with minor differences
E.g. longer country names have of course a translation (e.g. Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika for the USA, but "USA", the letters pronounced in German, is used too)
German spellings often have minor differences, mostly based on the pronounciation of letters (Czechia-Tschechien, Chechnya-Tschetschenien, Chad-Tschad, Canada-Kanada, Botsuana-Botswana), or the originally Latin ending *-ia* becomes *-(i)en* in German (Italien, Indien, Spanien, Australien Litauen, Polen, Serbien, Kroatien, Syrien, Albanien)
A few countries have the ending in -ei for some reason (Slovakia-Slowakei, Turkey-Türkei, Mongolia-Mongolei, Czechia-Tschechei (not official, very colloquial))
Countries with "North" "South" and "New" are translated as well (South Sudan-Südsudan, New Zealand-Neuseeland, Northern Ireland-Nordirland, North Macedonia-Nordmazedonien)
Austria - Österreich
Netherlands - Holland (colloquial)
Belarus - Weißrussland
Germany - Piefkinesien
Rakousko sounds pretty awesome for some reason
Hochwähli für Piefkinesien
You have to complete this
Germany - Piefkinesien
Germans - Saupreißn
just been joking, its a cute little [nickname]
It comes from Old High German ['Ostarrîchi']  \- which literally means Eastern Realm
(modern German "East" = "Osten")
Bussi :D
Ich versteh bis heute nicht wie man als Standardsprachler ohne auskommt
Ihr verwendet das "eh" nicht
Jessas na
> Netherlands = Alankomaat
That sounds like Alkomat, the thing you blow inside when they suspect you've been drunk driving
Flag confusion
Jo eh, bast eh so :)
Ah okay
So basically a direct translation
Oh that's cool
I knew Germany is basically Saxony in Finnish, but that is news to me
It's the same in German with barber shops
They either use the German word "Haar" or the English word "hair" in their puns
Not shops but our tash cans on the street mostly have cute little wordplays on them revolving around
well trash
From the top of my head:
"Hasta la mista, baby
" (You got the trash, baby
"Hairlich"
"Hairzig"
"Feinschnitt"
"Head Coutoure"
"Schnittpunkt"
Also, Herr Kutz in GTA 5 :D
Hair ARTner
For the Barber Shop of Herr Artner
Still my favourite
We read the whole thing in Mittelhochdeutsch in German class in high school
Although, my German teacher was in fact a schlagender Burschenschafter, very clearly a pan-German nationalist and allegedly a Kellernazi (he constantly talked about how "unjust" the current German-Polish border was, and how "degenerated" the new orthographic rules were, and how we Austrians are "actually" really Germans, and how there's too many US-TV-shows with black people in them on the "bolshewik" Austrian Public Broadcasting; also he was a linguistic purist and prescriptivist)
So that might have had to do something with it
Still, I liked the Nibelungenlied
It's a cool story
I can still recite the first stanza
Generally we often read stuff that was for school purposes very ... unconventional
Like Ernst Jünger's super-boring and WWI-glorifying novel "In Stahlgewittern". Our teacher was very opposed to reading its more anti-war counterpart "Im Westen nichts Neues", because he thought Remarque was a weakling who complained too much
we studied it in school and I'm from austria haha
It's actually a nice story
> Wtf is a Kellernazi, never heard about that ~~impression~~ expression
Somebody who is an old Nazi, but not in public
They only *really* let it out at home in the Keller where nobody can see or hear it
In the Keller they have a bunch of old swastika flags and a Stahlhelm, and an old Luger, and a signed 1st edition copy of "Mein Kampf". And once a week they lock the front door, go down into the basement, put on their SS-uniform, sing the Horst-Wessel-Lied and "Die Wacht am Rhein" in front of their Führerporträt and shed a salty, salty tear into a glass of German beer for the Downfall of the 1000-year long Reich
And once a year on the 20th of April, they go to their  favourite restaurant and eat [Eiernockerl mit Salat]
So basically Alexander Gauland
> I am astonished that you read "In Stahlgewittern"!
In hindsight, so am I!
> Didn't the ~~Director~~ headmaster or principal [director = Regisseur] have anything to say against that
Not really, teachers are usually relatively free to do what they want
Of course you can't just uncritically read "Mein Kampf" or something like that, but "In Stahlgewittern" is not openly a Nazi-book or anything
It's a "just" a pro-war WWI book, by an author who "just happened" to be very well-liked among Nazis and other ultra-nationalist circles during the Weimar-period
> And when were you in School actually
I successfully passed my Matura (Austrian Abitur) in 2010
So not *that* long ago
> but reading the whole thing in middle high German would probably be a bit much for a seventh grader
Yeah ... we did that in the 5th (= German 9th) grade
Personally, I thought it was very boring
But I thought most things we read in school were boring
Our teacher using teaching methods from the 1960s (taking turns reading out loud in class for *hours and hours*) wasn't really a huge turn-on for reading
Exception: *Die Räuber*. We read that out loud, but "in character", I had the role of Spiegelberg
We really got into it and really acted it out
They are
Ulrich Seidl even made a nice movie about it
[Here's the trailer]
We currently have to defend our garden against a wild roebuck that thinks the things growing in our garden are delicious
Else it's mostly smaller animals that dare to run around in the village
A cat chasing a squirrel isn't that uncommon
I often see hares, frogs and grass snakes which unfortunately seem to love my garage
Sometimes I see deers, more in safe distance on the fields and not near the houses
Weasels too, but some neighbours raise chickens so I guess those attract them
Once I saw a fox, but it honestly looked very meager and desperate
Hedgehogs, rats, weasels, foxes, badgers, ducks, squirrels and more
All of these are fairly often seen in Vienna
I personally have seen all of these except badgers
I live at the border of a city in Austria and we have wild deer, rabbits and Mustelidae in our gardens
Deer do love to eat leaves from our fruit trees
Much like in F1, short term financial gains drive all decisions
Apparently, that means that countries that have a ... different standard of human rights are becoming increasingly popular, as they are also emerging markets, therefore important for sponsors
Many of the decisions in top sports feel very strange to me and i wonder what my tipping point will be to lose the last bit of interest
I hate that it's in winter and I that it's in Qatar
> Many of the decisions in top sports feel very strange to me and i wonder what my tipping point will be to lose the last bit of interest
Qatar 2022 is that tipping point for me
On the domestic (skiing) front it was the whole theater of the Austrian winter tourism mafia (especially the funicular operators) during the corona pandemic, and over the last few years in general ([e.g the completely unnecessary Hinterstoder extension] The ÖSV and especially the unbelievably egomaniacal autocrat Peter Schröcknadel are highly involved in all of this (e.g. Schröcknadel owns Hinterstoder)
> I know my stance on this won't make a difference
It might, if you "infect" others with it
If you look around this comment section, you are far from the only one who is planning to boycott it
> tv channels shouldn’t show it
It won't be all exclusively on pay-TV anyway
Amnesty International is not a controversial source when it comes to slavery and other human rights abuses
Also, the article you linked is paywalled
Weather/climate
There were simply not as much less tasty, fresh ingredients around in the north, so people had to make do with what they had
Before we explored other parts of the world all of our food was rather bland
(As in, all of Europe)
red cabbage has always something festive to me, as it only served with good things like game, venison and better parts of beef
I really ate good everytime in Ireland
Yeah, cooked in red wine and vinegar
Well, it was mostly salmon, potatoes, parsnips and chicken
And lamb shanks
Pasta like pappardelle or most kinds of filled pasta ist easy to make though
Source: I love making pasta
Heiliges Römisches Reich (Holy Roman Empire)
I think in Germany you also put „..deutscher Nationen“ (..of German Nations) after it but I’ve honestly never heard somebody call it that around here
Not even textbooks
(But I may be wrong)
Now, not then
Don't confuse today's "nation" with what they understood as "nation" in 962, 1600, or 1850
The definition of nation has changed many times,  and even today there is no one clear-cut defintion
Note that it also *doesn't* mean "der Deutschen Nation", as in belonging to the German nation
it means "deutscher Nation" as in "deutscher Natur" or "deutscher Herkunft"; so, of a German  type or manner (to distinguish it from the old Roman Empire)
Well in German language (I live in Austria and I don’t really know how it is in Germany) it is extreme
Even our chancellor used the words „outdoor“ and „indoor“ last week instead of the German „draußen“ and „drinnen“.
As I said I don’t know about Germany but if there were some actions to be made it would probably need Germany for that as their are firstly the bigger country and secondly Germany has way more people that speak actual written German
In Austria most people could speak written German but hardly anyone does so as every part of Austria has dialects
I feel like people complain a lot about English loanwords
I am not the biggest fan either tbh (e.g. safe, cringe, etc)
But there isn't really a movement
I've heard "arbeit" meaning "part-time job" in Japanese anime too before
It's interesting, because we German speakers do something similar
A "Job" is most often referred to as some sort of irregular one-time work or a part-time job, while "Arbeit" refers to a full, 36-40 h/week occupation
Yeah I have no problem with Computer, Handy and so on
But if people start using safe, cringe and so one it gets very annoying
Are you aware of the phrase "menj a francba"? No offense, just curious
I thought for a long time that "hash browns" are brownies filled hashish
Turns out it's just mashed and fried potato buns
I get why they are *brown*, but the *hash* part is very confusing
Turns out one is French, and is what we call in German *Haschee*, and is probably related to *faschieren*. The other one, *hashish*, comes from Arabic
I barely/never get any words mixed up, which is surprising considering how forgetful I am
Except when I learn new words, like a year ago with sensitive/sensible
In german, sensitive is „sensibel“, often also written as „sensible“, as I‘ve seen, and sensitive is vernünftig/sinnvoll
Up until a few years ago I also really struggled with pronounciation, like I pronounced tomb and womb like bomb
Or I tried to avoid with anything I have to pronounce thorough out loud because I didn‘t even know how to start
(Now I luckily know how it’s pronounced :‘D)
Edit: and if somebody else makes a who‘s/whose error I won‘t notice it, until somebody else points it out lol
I often call a fan a ventilator
I mean come on, why would you not have a ventilator involved in ventilation
Hah, in my Austrian dialect, we also say hand instead of arm and foot instead of leg sometimes
I think it's just my specific Austrian dialect though, afaik
Saint Sebastian, our dear unfailable leader
Is Shevchenko a common name in the Ukraine or is it just coincidence that two of the most famous Ukrainians have that surname
Because idolizing Popes is inherently silly
Especially when they like John Paul II had serious problems like for example ignoring the child sexual abuse going on within the church
His legacy is not only his anticommunism,earning him the veneration of neocons for decades, but also the enabling and nurturing of a culture of denial and covering up of child diddling within the curch
A saint he aint
I hope his star burns bright and exhausts itself fast like Haiders
We don't need an amoral powerhungry twat in Power for decades only because he imitates Orban and grannys want to fuck him
Too jaded by rightwing poles really espousing that belief to not automatically belief it to be genuine
Better to zealous in pushing that back than let them pass
Ahhhh
Truly, you were right
>It doesn't seem to be as common as in surrounding countries thankfully
After reading that sentence I would have known you're Swiss without even looking at your flair
That sounds bizarre
What was the outcome
Fuck that rich dude
well, yeah, we are neutral since then
When you meaning a more direct issue, today it's cooled down, but 15 years ago the Benes decrees were a still a serious issue in our relationship with Czechia and Slovakia
for first world war, the South Tirol question flames sometimes up but it's mostly resolved since the 90's with the agreement made in the 70's, which was a pet peeve of Kreisky
Carinthia and Slovenia has also still some issues with the "Abwehrkampf", it's also more on the cold side today, but with Haiders shennenigans and the problems with the bilingual place signs Shows the issues are not buried yet
Kinda
Given the fact that we're probably about to get our second far-right government after the first one broke down due to corruption
adding salt here
Maybe he meant the Union xD
>-Faux positivity; when they post what seem to be really forced memes, pictures or stories that desperately try to push through a positive narrative but seem somewhat removed from reality (e.g. "This brave pupper guarding our airport
" or anything from /r/WholesomeMemes [the whole sub feels totally forced and contrived to me
" My apologies for not explaining this very well, but I'm a person who very much values sincerity and straightforwardness and I find myself feeling fundamentally suspicious of people who effect faux positivity
Yeah, this is the worst, that whole /r/WholesomeMemes sub in general is super shit
>E.g. "TIL Beavers won't chew on the sunny side of trees
>"DAMN IT MARK
>"Rachel that's not a toaster
>"This is why we can't enjoy our Wednesdays
Every fucking thread, all the fucking time it's exactly this shit
The only thing you forgot but kinda goes hand in hand with the faux-positivity is their relation with religion
Like how often their stories take place in churches (like in /r/TIFU : TIFU by shitting myself at church or TIFU by asking out  this cute girl at my church) and aparently it's totally normal in the US to regularly go to church even if you're otherwise normal
In my country you have to be seriously weird, old or super religious to go to church at sundays so I just can't relate
Sweet Mustard (Kremser) is the best condiment for fries - fight me
Or the general "thank me for my service" posts where suddenly someone is still in uniform or out of the blue mentions their military background unnecessarily
IIRC there was a survey/statistic posted about this topic on r/europe not so long ago
My voice is softer in german than it is in English
I'm friendlier for some reason but my personality does not change
No, I don't think it does
People get louder
For example, if you sit in a restaurant and some local comes in with a stranger and talks with him English the local is always way louder than all other people in the whole place, at least in Austria or Germany
You can easily follow the conversation even if they sit several tables away
Insecure or showing off
I don't know but it's annoying as fuck
I think I adjust my personality not for the language, but for the people to whom I have to talk to in english
too much Hollywood action movies
Or maybe you only use it for sex
:-P
Idk either, maybe I am just more polite in german

Vienna: diverse mix between traditional/imperial and modern architecture, amongst the cities with the best quality of living in the world, kind of the Austrian Berlin regarding the fact that it's a melting pot for creative people
Salzburg: Mozart, very snobby, best Austrian football club, expensive
Innsbruck: very expensive, paradise for wintersports, sorrounded by mountains, university city (population: 130k/students: about 35k)
Linz: good economy, lots of job opportunities in technical industry, boring and not beautiful
Graz: the only Austrian city where the communist party actually gets voted, also a university city, low costs of living
For linz you should've mentioned affordable

Many Carinthian surnames have Slovenian roots
Many of those typical Carinthian names have a Slovenian root, describe an area and end with -nig(g)
They have a Slovenian origin but are much more common in southern Austria than in actual Slovenia
Blatnig, Sablatnig, Wlatting, Glantschnitg, Glawischnig, Goritschnig, Hribernig, Kopeinig, Lutschounig, Poganitsch, Pototschnigg, Petutschnigg, Verschnig, Wernig etc
There are also many common Slovenian surnames that got "germanized" : Čebul -> Tschebull, Strnad -> Sternat, Šoja -> Tschojer, Čižek -> Schischegg, Černi -> Tscherne
If your surname is "Hettegger" or "Prommegger" you are probably from the valley of "Großarl".
nerdy question, but given Cristiano Ronaldo's last names which are dos Santos and Aveiro, could you pinpoint him from that as being from madeira
And if your surname is "Pfeifenberger" you are probably from the Salzburg Lungau region, especially in or near Zederhaus
Yeah, but I have read somewhere that such Slovenian names (describing a place) are more common in southern Austria than in modern day Slovenia
The interesting thing is that basically every slavic language got their names "germanized" differently
"-ig" is typical for carinthian slovene names, "-ek" for czech ones, and "-itsch" is for south slavic ones
There is probably also some system for the "-ich" ones but I dont know it
Edit: Burgenland Croatian names seem to have "-its" for most, "-itz" for others and "-ich" for a few ones
I don't hope so
I'm German and I've lived in Austria for the past three years
I love it here, especially in Vienna, and I don't plan on returning to Germany anytime soon
Been living in Vienna for 5 years now
It’s allright, but I subjectively can’t see myself spending my whole life here
It simply feels foreign and not like home
However, Romania doesn’t either anymore
I don’t exclude moving back, but I would rather try another European country in the near future before that
Moved in Austria 2 years ago
No intention of going back
Maybe going further west, but not back

lmao why is the first sentence in your text book a robbery
"Hands up

Don't do anything stupid
That's basically the German "One, two, three, Freddy's coming for you" just without Freddy
I understand two words out of those and not one of them translates to "darn".
*esta viejo y podrido
*ser* is for general properties (i.e. the cheese has always been bad and also has had a long and fulfilling life and is enjoying its retirement now)
*estar* is for states and temporal properties (the cheese has gotten old and smelly)
the best way to remember it: Soy ciego = I am blind
Estoy ciego = I am way too drunk ("blind")
My mom taught me that one
Edit: she didn't use it on me - she just told me that they used it in their childhood

No idea how that was chosen, I guess the country of Mozart, Schubert and Bruckner has had a long fall from grace
The worst part though is that I and my friends used to sing that in elementary school, fun times
Austria has the honour of being the first country ever to officially end up in last place
This was in the 1957 Eurovision song contest, which was only the second one in history and the first one using a public points system
We got a total of 3 pity points for [Bob Martin's "Wohin, kleines Pony
"] The song actually isn't that awful, mind you, especially considering that we've had much much worse ones since then
I remember that the 1991 entry, [Thomas Forstner's "Venedig im Regen"] was considered to be a real stinker by everyone around here
It was a horrible song, and the singer didn't even manage to stay on key
Zero points, and rightly so
(Also, that hair
That outfit
I loved Calm after the storm
my answer to this question as well
this song makes me cringe
Don't forget about Alf Poier "Weil der Mensch zählt". Hilarious
fuck I completely forgot about that :(
A true train wreck
ohhh
I remember that song

that whole thing was just awesome and funny
Perfect ESC material
If that's the song I think it is, I have no idea how it goes but I was a big fan
Yeah,german party Songs in the early 2010s sure were
Something
Maybe it‘s for the better
They were actually in their early 20s
Flashback to a few years ago when germany sent in a [weeb girl] on a dark and mysterious stage, but then she sung
a super boring ballad
Like, what was up with that
Did they chicken out in the last board meeting or what
No and I‘ve never heard of that /:
What‘s it about tho
I wanna know now
And where is this primarily worn
And when
This right here
It's quite perverse for certain peoples if you think about it
The Irish, Finns, Georgians, Ukrainians and many more were essentially forced to fight in a war for nations that were suppressing them and actively tried to eradicate their culture against nations that may have given them independence
In Austria its the polar opposite, we still got traditional groups dressed up as soldiers from WWI doing some epic stuff on our streets, but then again we didn‘t have our imperial flag from WWI plagued by Neo Nazis
IMO there should be a remembrance day for both WWI and WWII soldiers in germany, but it‘s probably gonna get ruined by neo nazis again aswell
We don‘t learn much about WWI either, my education about WWI was literally this and I quote: „About 20 Million people died, now let‘s move onto WWII“
It's a difficult topic for sure
The involvement in the war itself is universally seen as bad though, there's no real argument about that
What is occasionally grey is the manner of annexation
Should we have fought back after Britain, Italy and France refused to help under any circumstances already
I'm heavily leaning on yes, we should have
Even if just to prove the guarantees of peace of the victorious powers of WW1 for the sham they really were
The most important question is if a majority of Austrians really wanted the annexation or not
And that is a really difficult question to answer, since there's legitimate evidence and arguments for both yes and no
European unity is a good concept in principle, but the same doesn't apply to imperialist powers of the past who tried to push the perceived supremacy of their culture and language on the people they subjugated
I mean, just look at Ireland, their language was almost eradicated
So separatism can of course be justified if it's against an actual oppressor
And let's be fair, most minorities in the early 20th century had fair reason to separate from their respective countries
Ah, nice to know
Germans usually like Austrians, Austrians generally dislike Germans
At least that's my experience
Non-answer: Hard to say, because within these two countries there are plenty differences too
Germans are not all similar (eg
Bavaria vs Bremerhaven), and neither are Austrians
Vienna is where the devil found his equal
Nuff said
"What divides Austria and Germany is their shared language
It's
Tüte / Sackerl
Aubergine / Melanzani
Wiener Würstchen / Frankfurter
I, for myself, think that the language is connecting the two countries
Also the food quality seems to be better in Austria
I've heard many people complain about German supermarkets
Germany is a lot more "culturally Western European" than Austria; the only exception is Bavaria
We share quite a bit with them, but those similarities are more pronounced in the western, alpine part of Austria
Germans cannot make schnitzel to save their life and they are generally less open to arguments in a fun/casual way
Everything is very intense with them and I feel they are more extreme
The Austrian German is different (and way better) than the Germany german
And We have a particular fondness for blaming the germans for everything
I came to this thread expecting anything from stupid clichees, worn-out Anschluss and Hilter jokes, to people claiming that there's absolutely no difference at all
This is by far the most accurate description
“Wenn I amoi stirb, stirb, stirb
soin mi Fiaker trogn, und dabei Zithern schlogn
austria has only been part of Germany for 6 years in its history
The rest of Austrias history it hasn't.
Historically sure it could have developed with austria being part of germany, but it didn't. No other region of german speaking people had this development, because austria was part of the strong habsburger monarchy and because of politics etc austria just didnt become a part of germany when they formed in the 19th century
And that left a mark on austrians
Austria is the most unique German speaking region in all of the german speaking regions in europe, hence it being it's own country
Ooh look at me, I'm a Brit and I'm hitting se nail in se head
Yes
I was looking for this comment
Waltz is very accurate in his assessment
> and neither are Austrians
I am
Such a great and relevant answer
Agree
We tend to characterize it as "relationships before rules".
I can 100% agree
We gave you the guy that killed Hitler too
You're welcome
So what concretely makes Austria "small Germany" and e.g. Switzerland or Luxembourg not
Maybe read up on "großdeutsche Lösung" vs
"kleindeutsche Lösung" and the year 1848
Our grave yards have gift shops [
As has the funeral museum [
what mountains ?
ಠ_ಠ
I don't (am austtian)
He is right though (generally, of course)
> Those traits sound very specific and personal and impossible to generalise over entire countries
Height is very specific and personal, yet we can certainly generalize it
It's called statistics
I live quite near the border to germany and have contact to both friends/family in rural and urban areas in either countries and telling from my experience, it's absolutely true
Especially when talking to strangers, I could be joking with a shop assistant in Linz, but I wouldn't really do that in even a small villiage like Windorf
Well, the weather is correct tho
Hated the paintings, loved the antisemitism
Well, as I said, same goes for Thuringia and Cologne, as far as my experience goes :)
I certainly love all of you :)
You are similar
Great trade if you ask me
Danke für die Information
Das wusste ich noch nicht
No it is not the same
Frankfurter Würstl are made from beef and pork
AFAIR These were created by someone from Frankfurt in Vienna, where butchers weren't split in the beef and the pork kind (whereas in Frankfurt they were which made the Frankfurter Würstl illegal in Frankfurt at the time)
I guess when this type of sausage made its way back to Germany it came from Vienna, hence called Wiener there (or Wienerli in Switzerland)
Wait who is more direct for you
Well no considering Austrian cuisine has a lot of Balkan foods .
Sorry, I didn't want to imply a "German cultural homogenization" at all
>1200 years
holy Roman empire is not germany
Czech, Slovakians,... not german
>Switzerland by a margin
true
Second then
> 1200 years
Gonna need a source on that, buddy
That's kinda sad, I really don't get why so many Austrians have such a negative attitude towards you guys
Don't forget "Marmeladinger" !
quite
Austria has several official languages
Ich bin ein Berwiener, oder so
Care to explain why you think some of us don't like you
Germans are generally seen as more arrogant and brash, doesn't help that high german is a rather hard language, compared to the dialects spoken in Austria
Alright then, no worries
I've never seen that video, herrlich, Bierbauch vorraus, danke dafür!
There's even a song about how much nicer Vienna would be if everyone would die there:
I'm not saying austria doesnt have a shared history with germany
It obviously does
I just specified in my original comment that it only was part of germany for 6 years
I know Germany has many different people
The narratives that austrians pretend to not be germans is also very insulting
Even just the standard Germany-German dialect (which a lot of Germans claim to be no dialect but "proper" German) sounds overly formal and slightly rude to a lot of Austrians
Which is a weird insult to be honest
If you shit exclusively on a mountaintop it would end up downhill anyways
I somewhat doubt that tabloid article as I'm not sure how/if a slavic expression about a place/mountain in Styria would have carried over centuries into modern German
My suspicion of the term still being popular is more along the lines of the word transporting a feeling of "closed in by mountains" as well as helplessness and laziness
Something like "Already surrounded by mountains and nothing better to do than staying down in that ravine and taking a shit".
Well, a viral marketing group tried to stage someone stealing the top of the Zugspitze a few years back:
Its nearer to the colloquially German name, so yea I do
In Austria, we just call it "Tschechien" anyway, although some also call it "Tschechei", so I think it wouldn't be that bad
Yeah, because we say something similar in German already (Tschechien), so you really notice how unwieldy it is having to resort to "Czech Republic" in English in comparison
There is a dated German name for the Czech Republic, *Tschechei* which is more similar to Czechia
Ah, similarly to what we call "Tschechei" (area name) as opposed to "Tschechien" (the country)
Thanks for your comment
> Tschechei
I always thought that Tschechei is just the name for the region (Čechy) as opposed to the whole nation
As such, it has a strong "austro-hungarian empire" undertone, because it was used back then when you'd talk about the area (like "Böhmen and Mähren"), and not the country
I always considered it slightly problematic for that reason, because it's denying the Czech people its own nation, or at least not caring that things have changed since then
locally and to me personally, I'd say it has slightly historical and dialectal connotations, old people might use it more often than younger ones, and less educated ones more often than highly educated ones
I can attest that it's super common among Viennese workers and in certain regions of Lower Austria (Waldviertel etc
), nowadays used with the meaning of "Czech Republic".
eh, that's just the illogical nature of exonyms everywhere
why is Germany's name in other languages derived from so many different tribes that lived in the area (Germans, Saxons, etc), but none of them are fully grasping or including all historical peoples in their name for the country
I know you jest, but to still give a countertpoint: if a country is not lobbying for and offering a practical name for itself in other languages, it shouldn't wonder when people will find their own, incorrect terms instead
Unitedstatesofamerica -> America, Unitedkingdom -> England, Côte d'Ivoire -> no thanks we'll stick to the local one that we know how to pronounce
I can only agree
I barely hear people say Tschechei
wtf nazi connotations
it has *austro-hungarian empire* connotations, and is the name of certain area, not the country
not seen as particularly tactful in the same way as calling romanian towns by their historical german names
also it's common in eastern austria, and has a strong dialectal/slightly historical connotation there
people with lower education, older people, and people from certain dialectal regions will often say Tschechei instead of Tschechien
Lol, never even noticed that, but you are right
That *is* a lot of consonants
It's because of the two sch mostly
In German you are so used seeing it as one unit, one sound
It doesn't even register as three separate consonants for me and how unwieldy it can make a word look
my experience is vastly [different] Wiener Arbeitermilieu bzw
Waldviertel
it's honestly just because of sch, which is ʃ
Gives me a Mordor-y vibe
I like it
Yes and no
It's true, it's supposed to look like a castle/city walls (has windows and all), and that is maybe also a hint at the CoA of Castilla, but it is at the same time still a crown
This heraldic element is called "[mural crown] and is a typical symbol burgués and/or republican
Basically it means the citizens themselves (the bricks) are the souvereign, not a royal
Can also be seen in our [CoA]
The black-red-golden tricolore in this form stems from liberation wars against Napoleon and can be attributed at least since 1815
The use of the colors itself is of course much much older and is based on the colors of teh CoA of the HRE
Hm I have never thought about it, but this seems to get along well with Ironie, Sarkasmus and Zynismus triplet, also ascending in malignity
German (which has an unbelievable amount of dialects, but there are main dialects for every state so the basic number is 16), Austrian-German (fun fact: Austria has so many different dialects that they‘re not countable
I always learn new words for different things
I have a friend who lives 15 minutes away and she doesn’t even know some words I use lmao
But there are also main dialects for every state, so 9
) and Swiss-German (which has probably just as many different dialects)
The South Tyrols in Italy have a different dialect too and I wouldn‘t be surprised if Liechtensteiners also all have different regions with different dialects, despite its size
Having dialects in my language is so basic to me that I‘m more surprised if a language _doesn‘t_ have big differences between regions
As a non-native Russian speaker I can only confirm this
I talked to many people from European and Asian regions - I understand them all to the same extend
I never once had the thought 'wow, that Asian guy is difficult to understand', they speak the same way somebody from Petersburg does
I think it's noteworthy that in Austrian constitution the Slovenian language (alongside others) is protected and that this paragraph was taken over from the monarchy times
So repression of the Slovenian language was not a constant over time
Also nationalism as we understand it today is a relatively new concept
In the middle ages and early reconnaissance, people who lived in one village didn't understand the ones of the next anyway so people often used Latin or French and nationality was less defined by your ethnicity than rather by your lord
So countries with mixed ethnicity where quite normal back at that time and some of them like Belgium still exist to this day
With that in mind as a Styrian I feel proud about my mixed heritage
I don't see my culture as something Germanic/Baviarian but the product of centuries of intermingling and coexistence of Slavic and Germanic culture and several words in our dialect has Slovenic roots, although there are too many who think it is important to crowbar those things cultures from each other and I also feel sorry for the damage nationalism did to our slovenian brothers and sisters by shaming their language
well, the Russians made very sure that the colonization works and had very strict language programs in every single village
At least that's how it was explained to me
Oh thank you, that is very interesting
Funny enough, we have such a person as well, he writes books though and is called Bastian Sick, also lots of wrong claims and explanations but people are so into him
If you start correcting somebody people will think you are super smart no matter how much bs in your arguments is
Says a Spanish person :P
There is the old saying: "The whole world leads war, but you Austria just marry". The reason for this was that the Habsburgs collected their Lands not by force for the most part, but by marrying their numerous daughters to lords and kings so that after 1-2 Generations it came into their possession through inheritance
So basically they practiced make love not war, before it was cool and more successful
Vienna: tourism, art, music, probably historians (like tbh any other European city), Sachertorte
Salzburg: music probably (maybe some art and historians too
Innsbruck: Winter tourism
Around here Graz is said to be the city of Tech and Vienna the city of Universities and stuff, but idk if it‘s just in my federal state or nationwide
Linz: Heavy industry, steel etc
Ferlach: Guns
Vienna: everything (politics, commerce, culture, research)
Linz: heavy industry and some biotech
Graz: car industry/mechanical engineering in general and mining, research in those areas
Salzburg: tourism, culture
Klagenfurt, Innsbruck: summer and winter tourism (K more summer, I more winter)
Bregenz: don't know, have never been
Eisenstadt and especially St
Pölten: sleeper towns to Vienna
Really
Guns
Probably Glock's?
Mainly yes
But also winter sports fans
I would say skiing is definitely the biggest reasin, but there are other sports as well
And imagine doing a spa weekend while there is snow outside and you are looking out onto the mountains
Or taking a walk in the snow
Going to Christmas markets etc
Lots of things to do in winter
I've been to Eisenstadt once
I think they are a bit for tourism
>Guns
Probably Glock's?
No, Ferlach has been a "Büchsenmacherstadt" for about 400 years before Glock was founded
Ferlacher Guns are known world wide
There is even a gun and a target on the city's [coat of arms] The HTBLA Ferlach is also a famous school for gun smithing
Didn't know that
Thanks
I would say Biontech/Pfizer for Austria while Biontech is mostly put in the first place
Sometimes only Biontech
Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Croatian (and Serbian
), Slovenian, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian
If I didn't forget anything
Spanish, Italian, English, German, Polish, French and danish
German, Dutch, French, Italian, Russian, English, Austrian Dialect (that counts
), Greek, Spanish
Not to say I speak all these languages, but travelling and meeting people helps with basic like "helo", "please" and "thank you". just to be polite
streber lol
Haha, maybe this is the last big mystery that language beholds for me :D
Haha I actually knew it at some point
I was once in Lithuania and tried to learn some phrases, but all I still remember is Dziugas :D
I am not sure about these - I never was in these countries
I mean, of course everybody would understand Russian or could be a native Russian speaker, but I don't know by heart what 'thanks' is on Ukrainian or Belorussian
oh very cool, thank you :)
Mrs

Remembering a German coffee roasters advertised ther new sorts available with "Jedem das seine". Well it means each his own/Suum cuique but this was also written on the entrance of Buchenwald
After the German Jewish comitee complained they removed the ad
Yeah I'd bet they thought of the U2 song without knowing the background to it
You know what the lyrics of that song are about
The only thing I even know about Singapore is that there are quite high fines when you litter
That's it
tiger state, government agencies that work in a very efficient and streamlined manner (everything's offered in multiple languages, things get done quickly, many things can be done online), lots and lots of aircon, clean parks, clean main roads and seedy back alleys, first intelligent city toll system with automatic toll adjustment depending on area/time, awesome new airport, interesting green building exteriors, huge replanting effort to save the trees that had to be moved during some alleyway construction, funny accent and "no pok
" video guy, polite politicians, mahjong, a girl I met that came from there that had *never* been to a proper forest in her *life* before (we went hiking in Japan, climbed a mountain and she asked where the peak was, because she couldn't find the "this is the recommended spot for selfies" sign), cheap and good tailors, kopi tiam and nice noodle dishes, conflict with indonesia about air quality
It's easy for travelers who want to see a big Asian city but are afraid/unexperienced in travelling, because of it's Britsh influence
Clean and safe
I did a two night stopover on my way to Australia
I **really** liked the night zoo
had a stop there when i went to down under
nice airport, impossibly clean
not much else to say, it was only 6 hours
Clean and authoritarian
I heard that chewing gum is prohibited there
Is this true
A song by german Pop singer Markt Forster called "Au Revoir".
Ich brauch Freiheit, ich geh auf Reisen
Ich mach alles das, was ich verpasst hab
Fahr mit 'nem Gummiboot bis nach Alaska
Ich spring in *Singapur* in das kalte Wasser
Ich such das Weite und dann tank ich neue Kraft da
Which roughly translates to:
I need freedom, I go on trips
I do all that things that I missed
Travel by a rubber boat to Alaska
I spring into cold water in *Singapore*
I look into the distance and then I tank new power
Lol, somehow I've heard this only from germans, never from my own countrymen
People who lived through WW2 and the following occupation always told me that gaining independence was the best thing that could have happend
Edit: It is true that after WW1 a majority of people living in the new state auf Austria were in favor of joining Germany
This was due to the fact that the empire they belonged to vanished without a trace, leaving them with no sense of belonging other than a linguistic belonging to the German language family
But why
What could be so bad about chewing gum that they thought they have to ban it
The SA and SS helped you vote and it was far from a secret ballot
It is possible that the Nazis would have won nevertheless but thats what happens when a Nation offers thousands of jobs to an austerity ridden nation (thanks mises you prick)
Austria ‚conquered‘ huge territories and partnered up with many powerful allies by marrying family into royal houses throughout the world since the late middle ages
Known as „Habsburger Heiratspolitik“. Their motto was „war may do the others - you, oh lucky Austria, marry
“. The irony was strong on this one, as Austria was horribly bad at warfare
We even accidentally fought our own men during war agains the ottomans
Wiener ("Viennese") sausages are only called so outside of Austria
We call them Frankfurter
If I may take a guess from which country you‘re from: Greece
Why is it controversial; because of the cost
Hard to believe
hello,
you should be tortured forever

(and yeah, you really know how to trigger us Austrians
Yeah, that's so funny
It's probably one of the biggest honors in chemistry/physics to have an element named after you
And then there's this small town that has *four* named after it, in some unoriginal way :D
afaik that used to be the case, but they stopped, and the tunnel should be the replacement
No, that stands for "All the world is subject to Austria" (Alles Erdreich ist Österreich untertan or Austriae est imperare orbi universo)
But it was also an Austrian Motto, I think at a different time though
I know we were just talking about sausages, but I'm not a guy
What you call a [Wiener] we call a Frankfurter
What you call a Frankfurter, we call a Frankfurter
Basically there's no distinction by ingredients here, and if you buy a Frankfurter in Austria it could be anything from pure pork, to pork and beef, to chicken or turkey
The German name for this type of dough is simply Plunder
The version of it that is used in Denmark seems to be slightly different as to the ratio of ingredients that are used, and pastries made with the Danish variant of the dough would apparently be called "Kopenhagener Gebäck" according to Wikipedia, but I've honestly never heard that before
(I'm guessing it's probably simply too similar to the mainstream Plunder dough pastries here, and it wouldn't catch on from a commercial standpoint to have something that's almost but not quite the same)
I only had the hugs awards but have it anyway because I agree
Joking about how miserable you are whilst actually really being hurt on the inside

The Czechs would be a good opponent probably
Make 10 New ski alpin disciplines so we can finally rival the Norwegians with their 100 cross-country skiing disciplines
(Swiss would approve as well)
I swear, there is no possible way to scan all product throwing items over the counter this quickly

Our battle will be legendary
We just are
Death is inevitable, and life is pointless, other than leaving as pretty a corpse as possible
Well, that is because you aren't supposed to
Haha sure, just wanted to exaggerate
Thanks for the explanation anyway
You might meet lots of older people working too fast for them to put it away, i assume
And are you annoyed when someone picks out coins to pay exactly or dont you care
I remember that time
Those were machines
Okay, this is not gonna be as strange as the other comments, but we have the DAÖ, a party that was created because a few politicians thought it was unfair for another politician to get kicked out of his party for being corrupt, so they created the DAÖ.
Well we have a beer party
In the last election a party called BPÖ (Beer Party of Austria) ran for seats in Vienna
I think their program is rather self explanatory
And here I thought Boris Johnson had a few more votes
Well, between that, Jobbik and Fidesz
i mean, we're hardly one to talk but your political landscape right now is barking mad
I would accept Anschluss if that means I can vote for Die Partei
Please explain

Waiting for some hungarian to comment: would be even bigger if your people wouldn't have shot some austrian dude
So you are saying there's only 6 big countries out of over a hundred
[The projections on maps lie]
Only in long distance trains, not in regional ones
We do, in the trains through bigger cities
But in the ones everywhere else, no
We have them in Railjet trains (high speed trains), but (unfortunately) nobody gave a shit and I think a lot of people did not notice
Now they improved the signs, it is color coded in green and says "Ruhebereich", something you really cannot unsee
It works better than before, but it would be nice if the reservation system would have sort of a checkbox system, if you are travelling with a kid etc
It is in my opinion rather pointless, to have screaming kids in every coach
It would be much better if there was something like special family coach in each train, space for buggys and bikes
In Salzburg, the quiet areas were also tested in regional trains
But unfortunately everyone ignored it
Not to forget the family zone which is the complete opposite of quiet
Salzburg
A bit too much tourists but a beautiful city for sure
Vienna
Has a bit of "big international city" flair, but is actually not all too big
And the public transport is fantastic
Funny to see this pop up here, I've been to Kerteminde efterskole (not as a student)
So basically you're a Northerner, regardless of the country you're in
Especially Norway
Norway has a lot of North
Almost all of Norway consists of North
<3 from grumpy Vienna
When I started travelling to other cities when I was younger, I was so surprised to see how people interacted both with me and among each other
At first I thought it was a specific city where people were so ridiculously friendly, bzt then I realized that no, it's actually us, we are the outlier
Now I'm back though, and thank god, can't stand those smiling assholes
How is the overall Meme culture in your native language
Do you prefer them or English memes
Are there some special meme formats used more in your language/country other than what's "hot"?
r/okoidawappler
I hate german memes in general, the only exceptions are political memes in r/Austria or r/aeiou specifically made for us
Other than that english memes only
There are some good memes but yeah
Most german / austrian memes are rather bad
I have to say I think german memes are awful
There are some more meme pages on Facebook that are not that bad but still overall I don't really enjoy them
Sometimes there are some diamonds in the rough but you'll have to dig in my opinion
I only look at my subscribed stuff, so I dont have that problem
...what would be cool though is if there would be a cooking related sub, thats not 99% American
I couldnt even get the ingredients
r/chefkoch ;)
Hmm
r/KochenundKulinarik hätte Potential
I dont know, most of the ingredients I dont even know
Often its some texmex stuff, Ive never heard of and I really doubt its buyable in my city
And I somehow dont like the idea of ordering food from the internet - I am just not that much invested
For cups you have [these things] to measure
Usually you can get it at kitchen supply stores
Yeah, but maybe thats the American influence
Altough I bought recently an Italian cooking book and almost everything included tons of oil and cheese
I didn't expect that at all
Still healthier than 5 gallons of it
KZ Mauthausen, without a doubt
The day long hiking trip in last elementary school year (from Gaberl to großer Speik and back)
Open air museum Stübing (old farm buildings)
Graz guided tour, we went in a tunnel and came out inside the clock tower, cool the see it once from the inside)
A salt mine and a lead/zinc mine
Bird of prey show in Landskron
We did the Cool trips above all in elementary school
The other were:
Kaprun Hydropower plant
Mellach coal power plant
Yeah, we never were in a KZ
KZ Mauthausen and the nuclear power plant in Temelin
None
In elementary school there were some day-trips but nothing really memorable
And for high school we didn't really do any single-day field trips
Almost everything that was planned got cancelled for us
I can remember some trips with music class to concerts and one to the opera, but that was only some hours and I wouldn't consider it field trips
Also not very memorable
There was a hiking trip in maybe grade 7, but all I can remember is watching Scream on the bus, and some vague things about building a shelter in the woods and doing some team building exercises
I usually got quite a good memory for things like that but seems like nothing was really that memorable
I remember a lot about multi-day trips though
Same
The room with the books with all the names of the people who died there
Scary
>yes, for me too
I was going to say the same thing
We never did that
Every year we would have done a trip the teachers were on strike
Same here
Just being inside certain rooms made me feel ill
School, peers, siblings, parents, the internet (and I mean the whole internet, not only porn
E.g. I just looked up lots of stuff on wikipedia when I was a teen, but maybe I just was really dorky
), youth organizations
some really basic things from my parents, not as a "talk" though, but just as an honest answer to questions I was asking
only some of them are slightly cringey in hindsight, mostly I'm glad it went this way
we had proper sex ed in school of course, but back then (90ies on the countryside) it was kinda lame
kids nowadays have it better, recently saw that they have a "project week" where they'll learn about that stuff from various angles for a week, with lots of room to talk among each other with teachers, ask questions and also talk privately, divided by gender and all together; I found that was really really awesome
Like seriously, I think the importance "the talk" with the parents is blown way out of proportion, especially considering how most parents don't even know how to appoach the topic themselves
And the influence of peers and older siblings (in my case my two older sisters had "the talk" - i.e. penis, vagina, condoms, kinds of sex, you know, the ABC of sex - with me, without the parents, on a long car drive when I was 11) is way underrated
Not because those younger people know more about the topic, but because they are curious themselves, and kids can talk about sex stuff more openly with someone more or less their own age
Because puberty is a bitch, and parents suck
^/s
That said, the importance of good sex ed, where the facts are being set straight, can't be overstated
And that doesn't only concern biology teachers, but all teachers
History, social studies, languages, maybe even maths (like, learning how the pearl index works), or chemistry
Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia, is slowly but steadily growing and given how close it is to Austria, they are now building directly at the border (district: Nesto)
It's conceivable that - even tho some Austrian towns aren't too keen on being submerged - Bratislava will most likely grow into Austria
What makes this truly unique tho is the fact that Vienna, Austria's capital, is actually pretty close to the border as well
They are less than 60km apart
So maybe in the distant future we'll see something like a twin or duo capital city
There is an Austrian-Cuban- and Austrian-North Korean friendship society
It is not officially connected to the state, but some well known politicians are members of one of them
For example former president Heinz Fischer was Board member for the Austrian-North Korean-Friendship society before he was president
I think Austria is one of the few European countries that have a North Korean embassy and for example North Korean passports are printed by the same company that prints austrian passports (company is owned by the state)
And there was a strong connection between Jörg Haider, former Gouverneur of carinthia, and Saddam Hussein and Muammar Al gaddaffi, from Libya, with whom it is said that he was good friends
I honestly couldn't find any information how that happened
Austria and Australia
American post offices keep sending parcels to Australia instead of Austria
We know what you are talking aboot
This is probably the reason why the ship linking the two cities is called Twin City Liner
Or Im just stupid, that's also a possibility
Well it also mentions Austria, but let's not talk about that
Beautifully said
Let's give it time
Slovakia's economy is coming along well
Maybe it will get more attention once it's considered "fully developed" in most people's minds
Heast deppata, s'eh kloa dass des da Grund is
Wos redstn do so gschissn daher
Translation: You're probably right
Good observation
Yeah and that'll stall the process for a while which is why I don't see it happening for some time
But on the other hand the average salary in Bratislava is already on par with the Austria average and higher than in the rural areas nearby
At some point there'll be an economic pull effect
Probably to some extent, but there's free movement between us
I don't think it would be negative if Bratislava grew into Austria
I think Austrians would benefit from the business
Austria thinks the lake belongs to everybody, Switzerland wants clear borders and Germany doesn't care I think
Yes, Vienna is well known to have a lot of international spies and intelligence activities due to Austria being a neutral country and being located between East (USSR) and west (Nato)
Further more there are some big organisations such as uno, opec and iaea, that have offices here
Im not sure if that's the only reason, but it definitely contributes to the whole picture
The difference is that Slovenia and Slovakia are only about 370km away from each other, while it's 14200km between Austria and Australia
That means that parcels and letters will take a lot longer
Oida danke, bist a Hawara
Lass ihn dir schmecken, mein Freund
I feel honoured
I just said said "enjoy your apple, my friend" lol
For me it was le chat mange un pomme rouge
So my mom is Polish, my dad is Austrian, me and my brother were born and raised in Austria and both barely know any Polish (=almost not at all), because my dad prohibited us learning Polish because he thought kids weren‘t able to be raised bilingual and if me and my brother were raised that way we wouldn‘t know „proper German“ (as if he is the one that isn’t even able to write a whole sentence in perfect Standard German and always has to ask us two, usually me, to write one
Before this turns into a rant of my dad: I usually say I‘m Austrian, because I barely know any Polish and was born here
If people were to ask me, of course I‘d say that I‘m half Polish too
And if I were to ever pick up Polish again (I tried learning it for like 4 times but I‘m at the point were every other language I learned/tried to learn, Korean included, is easier to understand for me than Polish so yeah
) and actually know how to speak it a little bit I‘d identify with both too, but at the moment not really
Alright, I'm both an Italian and a German citizen but I live in the home country of my grandmother: Austria
If you ask about my national identity I'd say that I consider myself both Italian and German but more than anything I identify with being European
I’m not really in the situation you described, however, I have a very strong connection to Iceland (I’m from Austria)
Reason for that is that my fathers ex-wife is Icelandic and their children, my two half brothers, live in Iceland and I have a very good and close relationship with them, I even speak Icelandic and go there several times a year
A guy ate a sandwich after failing at his job
But Finland still lost
I know the Soviets had a lot of casualties, but still
Who would win:
Some yeety Czechy bois OR 1/3rd of Central Europe
Pyrrhic victory means a win that was a loss
I personally don't see how Russia lost
lmao what is this shit
We learned in school that the French word for "to kiss" is "baiser".
Well
Seems there was a slight shift in meaning happening after our teachers' graduation
Well I wouldn't say "whom" is not used, it's just less frequent
For example you might say:
"Pass it along to whomever you see fit", "Whom is your inquirey addressed to
Which technically is different than how it would've been used a century ago (where the preposition "to" would often be omitted, also it would never appear at the end of a sentence as that was considered poor grammar)
At least in North America, the usage of the word is still going strong
I do lament, however, the loss of the words "hither" and "thither" which are not only fun to say but convey meaningful information that we have to now express in two words "over here", "over there".
This seems to be common with German speaking teachers
"In English, people are much more polite than they are here, so always use *please* and *thank you* when asking for something
" Then I went to the UK and got greeted with an *Oi, move outta way cunt
* in line at the airport
What's a deutscherin supposed to be
Really
Wow
No, they taught us that in the 1980s ... too bad I don't have my old books anymore, I guess they would be a hoot for you guys
Well, English dialects evolved in pretty different directions
From personal experience, I'm mostly used to the Pacific Northwest (where I have family and spent a lot of time) but hearing other dialects, esp
from British Isles, I often have to strain my ears
I really like the Irish dialect though, especially with phrases using terms from Gaellic like "what's the craic"!
I have had italian for 3 years in school and never even heard about egli or ella
Oh, now I do see ...goddamn lol
"...aber, Pronto
Really
I've never actually heard anyone use kuseng before
Mostly people seem to say 'kusö(n)'
I think Vienna/Wien is the only Austrian city with a different English name
Honestly, Vienna kinda sounds better to me
Otherwise, most bigger Austrian cities don't have particularly nice names
Neither Graz nor Linz sounds particularly good to me
Of course, we got the well-known village of „Fucking“ in Austria
They seriously contemplated changing the name, because they had to replace the name-plate so many times
german pronunciation is obviously the same, except the „u“ sound is without the „j“ sound in English
Then we got places like „Mösendorf“, which roughly means „Pussyvillage“.
Or „Froschen“ and „Schweinern“ which mean „Frog-en“ and „Pig-ing“
And sometimes ppl must have been just lazy, bc you come across the occasional „Dorf“ which means simply „village“.
>Brno
Did you know that Brno is the Czech transkription of Brünn which was the original German name
Wenceslaus I of Bohemia settled German experts there to modernize the Agriculture
He was half Czech half German and did a lot for Czechia
Brno was long time home to German speaking Czechs for nearly thousand years
But back to your original question:
Vienna (= Wien in German)
Graz (this name has Slovenian origin it losely translates to Settling)
Klagenfurt (originally Furt der Klagen which means "Valley of Lament")
[Fucking]
Thal (German old word for Valley; birth place of Arnold Shwarzenegger)
Salzburg (Salt castle in German)
German speakers should pronounce it right too
We stretch the o much more than English does
The german version of Oradea is Großwardein (=big was your)
Pretty amusing
And then there is ...
5121, Austria
open the "o"
The entirety of Burgenland
Some communities try to pay people to settle there
Most of vienna thinks austria has 415km² and has about 2 million inhabitants so a viennese will most likely answer everything outside of vienna
Otherwise it is the burgenland or the austro-czech border
Basically anywhere that isn't Vienna, a but less so in the other bigger cities
Idk, we're pretty dense populated
I'd guess in the middle of a giant forest
Burgenland
Yeah, but some parts of upper Styria feel also so desolate
Rosegger Waldheimat felt really like in middle of nowhere while I was there and that's not even the most  desolate part of it
I don't get why though it's a really nice place to live in
The Waldviertel in Lower Austria too
Lots of forest (=wald), nots of people
Wildalpen it is
Waldviertel kinda as well
But they're trying
Historical reasons still
Burgenland's entire infrastructure was directed towarss Sopron and Szombathely, so after 1918/1945 it went to shit and they would have needed to build new infrastructure but didn't for a long fucking time
So people left and weren't replaced
We use to jokingly say that it's actually Hungary
Just talked about Jämtlandstriangeln with someone yesterday ;) but I get your point, Lappland is definitely internationally known
Lots of people tend to stay close to where they grew up
I feel like many tend to stay with their parents in the countryside and only way later move out to a big city because their job is there
However some never move to the city, especially farmers kids who tend to continue their parents farms
Idk what it is but I feel like  many people are born on the countryside and move to the city because easier access to everything
Idk how the wide countryside of Austria is still alive because it seems like nobody moves there, country people just suddenly exist, but it is
I also have to note that I live on the countryside with my parents, so I may be biased
Please correct me if I‘m wrong
// Also it should be noted that a good percentage of Austrians live in Vienna
I think almost 2 million out of ~9 million people
Still, "Landflucht" is a very big Problem for smaller villages
Lots of people move to the cities
I would not say that this applies everywhere
There are many quite rural regions that managed to build up some remarkable industries that keep even well educated workers in small villages
"Warning: falling cows"
(it's usually just the symbol, but that's its meaning)
Or especially at the nicest most romantic small alpine villages at the bathing places at the river there is a warning sign for flash floods and a wave as high as a man drawn
Not specifically a sign but many signs combined
Close to where I live there is/was an intersection where every year some people died
The first time I drove there it was during night
At first you see huge reflecting signs that say "Warning, deadly intersection ahead". Then your car gets shaken because they put grooves in the asphalt so you are alarmed
Then you see like 10 crosses of the accident-victims next to the road and then you see 2 huge stop-signs on both sides of the road
All this during a foggy night combined with the crosses of the dead was pretty creepy
Fun fact: i spoke to a farmer because i'd noticed a burnt spot on one of the meadows high up and he just casually said "yeah a cow took a fall and we had to burn it right there
I have seen that in Austria too
Much less then in the US for example but if you go hiking off the tourist trails it’s quite common to see street signs with billet holes in them
The greater good
> if any cattle end up chasing us we should be fine
You won't be
Could be both, but it is usually at the high-up pastures or more specifically the sign is put at road's passing at the lower end of a cliff and cows are grazing at the upper end at the high alp
Sometimes they come to close to the edge while grazing or slip and fall
Carry an umbrella
In all seriousness: drive carefully (i.e. always being able to brake to a standstill within your field of vision/ half your field of vision on a narrow road), and keep an eye on the road for dead animals or rocks
The danger is not so much that you get hit (that's just bad luck, and there's nothing you can do about it; but what are the odds ...), but that you hit something that has already fallen and is now blocking the road (can be avoided)
I mean what else is he gonna do
The only alternative would be to leave it for the vultures, which probably would be best
Yeah, that would be better i guess
But from what I've heard it's not that easy doing that in Austria
Typical Austrian overregulation and bureaucracy
The vultures might get sick you know
Not at all, really
I was surprised that we play it at all, to be honest
Not popular at all
There's at least 10-15 more popular sports here, I never hear any reports about it and don't really know anyone playing it
You surely mean you buy  preserved milk  (instrad of standard fresh, pasteurized, milk, which is always in in the refrigator aisle in any supermarket) in France and then put that one in the fridge
Or do you mean you only buy the eggs non-refrigerated
Eggs I put on the fridge,
The raw or pasteurization milk I put always in the fridge, the condensed/coffee milk and the plant milks only when they are open
Yes, both go in the fridge
I've never seen it any other way
Yes to both, though for the eggs mainly because I don't have counter space so the fridge is just convenient for them to put away in ;)
I keep eggs and milk in the fridge
My grandmother doesn't keep eggs in the fridge
I don't buy UTH milk so yes, the milk definitely goes into the fridge
Eggs, no
They are sold unrefrigerated and they stay that way at home
Eggs, milk and cheese
My in-laws don't refrigerate eggs, but keep them in a cooler pantry
How could you not put milk in the fridge
Wouldn't it go off in a day
Ours would
You can do many things with cold boiled eggs
Not really
Especially with older people or people with kids it's common to ask "can you wrap the rest" to take it home
I mean, if you insist on taking home tiny crumbs, it might seem weird, but I don't think anybody really cares
I'm glad of that, tbh
there is enough food waste in the culinary world as it is
I think it is common
Also depends on the meal, a schnitzel or 1-2 pieces of pizza will most likely be taken home,
just wrapping it in aluminium foil works
For other dishes like soup, or stuff with sauces I do not think it is common
It is definitely possible but uncommon
I buy as much food as I want to eat at a restaurant
I don't want to spend crazy amounts of money for cold food at home
In some restaurants with a sizable portion left over I've even had aluminium foil delivered by the waiter with the check unasked
Uncommon in Austria
What
In the rual areas where the portions are almost always huge it is very common
Especially with older people
Hm, maybe my family was too frugal for that
I grew up on the countryside but we kids had to share plates and the grown-ups didn't order more than main course and maybe shared a salad
US International: It's basically QWERTY, but it allows to type ü, ö, ä with just using AltGR+y/p/q (just the button left of the original letter so it's easy to rembember) or ß with AltGr+s
QWERTZUIOPÜ
ASDFGHJKLÖÄ
YXCVBNM
(also known as German QWERTZ)
Glad you asked, I use a modified QWERTZ layout, the [T2 Layout] It's easy to install and doesn't change any of the usual keys, but gives you an additional layer of many more [special characters] (mostly accessed through AltGr/AltShift)
It stays totally out of the way if you don't need it, but makes it easy to write things like a capital ẞ, proper „quotation marks“ and »literary quotation marks«, proper en – and em dashes —, and ð and ſ and ⌀ and æ and ≠ and ‽ and ✓ and ålƚ tħë diăcrīṭiçs you could ask for
It has the stated goal of making all latin-alphabet based national languages fully typeable in one layout, hence it's also called Europatastatur (even though you can write languages like Vietnamese or Hawaiian with it as well)
If you're on a German QWERTZ layout, I can highly recommend it
Additionally, if you want to make little adjustments (like adding more specific characters like ʒƷ), you [can do so] with the (now outdated, but still usable) [MS Keyboard Layout Creator] As something that we use so much each and every day, I think it's totally worth it to personalize our keyboard layout to our preferences
I'm a programmer so definitely US qwerty but i also have german qwerty and slovak qwerty installed when i need them
qwertz is evil and should be purged from this world
like who looked at the keyboard and said let's switch these two characters but nothing else
fuck that person
As Austrian myself I used the German QWERTZ for the longest time, but changed it at home about 2 years ago to QWERTY US international layout, and shortly after that at work too
I am still not completly used to it, but it wasn't too big of a change
And since the US international keyboard layout is the most complete one, I can still use all the Umlaute and every other special chars
Used QUERTZ until I moved to the US
Moving back to Austria now but will continue using QERTY
Much better access to special characters
T2 represent
Well, the [Europatastatur] implementation at least
If you feel like adding more diacritics again, the [T2 layout/Europatastatur] is a viable option (and quickly installed)
I use [the E1-Layout from 2018] and it has almost every Latin-based and Greek letter plus a few other symbols
WTF
That's nuts
Accents don't even exist in German, but I can write È easier than that
And our äöü keys are definitely not double occupied
When I press shift and ÄÖÜ the expected thing happens, capital letters
>But the accent key software implementation is a mac thing as far as I know
Works on Windows just fine: é È É è
Is this really not a thing with Italian keyboards
Dude, Le Pont du Gard is absolutely breathtaking
Nothing i saw in France came close for me except maybe Dijon-Prenois, if for completely different reasons :))
I heard Sardinian is the closest language to spoken Latin
Chains are only for emergency, short usages
so much this
it depends on the party, and the amount of people and food that's left over
and hoarding your alcohol would be seen as very weird here as well
because they will also have a line
Yeah, but hardly if you invite people for dinner
If I invite somebody I of course am going to cook for them
And I also disagree about dinner always being cold
If you are working full-time this would often mean no warm meals during the week
> think you're underestimating our winters
You are underestimating their winters
You can‘t compare Austria, were every road in the valley or flatlands will be free of snow in a matter of hours to Finland, were even the highways will be packed with snow for months
> i don't see the difference in performance to studded tyres and winter tyres with chains
The difference is huge
Chains are made for a short emergency
They suck balls, but are good enough to get you up a icy/snowy road
In Austria we are currently abolishing the tax reduction for light transports and its a drama
But good riddance
Wait, I thought you were against opening on sundays, but its really only being against it if its inconvenient for you
You want that doctors have open on sundays so that its more convenient for you, why should they sacrifice their sunday if you don't want to, same with all the other services that are open on Sunday
Loss di schmeckn, du geiles Fickschnitzel
"Let me kiss you, my gorgeous dear
Owa mit da Panier du Schnitzl, heit wirst klopft

Now that you write it, I think this is a significant line in an Eros Ramazzotti song

>I don't know his songs
How
I don't know about Italy, but in Austria he is/was **hugely** popular
Our only civil war and enacting the first fascist regime in Austria seems like a big thing
I don't know what you are talking about
O right poland, that nation that exists again
@germany and @russia can we partition that one again
And btw, germany you can have our share in exchange for bavaria
Deal
Well, his version of Germany died with him sooo
It's finally time for you to split up
Or find spme other solution but i am pretty shure that currently your nation just can't work
civil war lasted only for 3 days so it was really just the last resistance
No, we have enough conservative mountain weirdos already
How about Berlin
I think slovenia wouldn't be happy if we would try to get a coastline, and italy doesn't even give south tyrol back so i don't think that they would give us the righful austrian kingdom of venice-lombardy
And i mean hungary also holds righful austrian land most noteable the entire state of hungary
Really
Just wieden
Could't you have burned down all of vienna except wieden, in wieden is my university so i need that place, the rest of vienna i don't care about
(Yes i know that you call vienna wieden but wieden is just one district)
"Some kind of wild eastern mountain german" funny, laughed
Austria in German terms: Berlin with only Bavaria around it
Also the merger would result in us getting the CSU
Can you imagine the evil that the CSU-OVP alliance could accomplish
The real question is wether you like my art or not
Are you talking about accents or dialects
I know in English they're often used interchangeably but they're different things
In my own interest I'll say no ;)
It's not like people will give you a weird look or anything but I definitely feel a little bit lost whenever I'm in a restaurant alone, just because I don't really have anyone to talk to
Eat alone with confidence
Show dominance by ordering two main meals AND dessert
I thought this only existed in series, movies and books
I don't know if it's obscure or anything, but I think Hascheeknödel and Grammelknödel should be known more widely
Hascheeknödel are dumplings filled with ground sausage, Grammeln (so dumplings filled with is) are some sort of roasted pork belly fat (I cant't exactly describe it) that is a little bit crunchy and very tasty
I think it is something very underrated in our cousine
[Spinach dumplings]
[Schlipfkrapfen] They're not even that well known in the rest of Austria, but they are so delicious
Dumplings filled with mashed potatoes, spices, garlic and chive, cooked and then served with grated cheese and melted butter
They're so underrated
Hirn mit Ei
It's basically just scrambled eggs with pig's brain
I know a lot of people who love it but let's be honest that's just gross
Hascheeknödel are obscure in many parts of Austria
Try getting Haschee in Vienna
> Canederli
One of my favourite words - Italianized "Knödel".
I never understood why you call it federweißer, as we call it Sturm (just storm)
And it works for red and white wine
I make it myself
Fleischknödeln aren't half as good as Hascheeknödeln
Just make sure that the filling is not too low on fat, because this will make it pretty dry, so add some spicy and more fatty sausage too
I think the word is actually from the russian, but i may be mistaken
It's very a similar dish, only that Spinatknödel usually are bigger
Which probably makes them less efficient for priest-strangling since you can't gobble them down as a whole
Do give them a try, they may look humble but they're really tasty
Some people find bread dumplings (Semmelknödel) a bit hard to make because they tend to fall apart if you don't prepare them the right way
The two most important steps in the recipe are to let the bread dough soak for half an hour, and to not boil the heck out of the dumplings but just simmer them
(That recipe also doesn't mention seasonings
Salt, pepper and nutmeg are the most common ones)
>I don't understand how kebabs and baklava somehow became the face of Turkish cuisine
It's the face turkish imigrants cuisine in Western Europe
My uncle is a retired chef in Rome
I'm blessed :D
Yeah that sounds reasonable
We basically have white, red and schilcher sturm
[Schilcher] is a red or rose wine from Styria and sourish
It is different to what some regions in Germany call schilcher
There is a quote from pope Pius 6
„Sie haben Uns einen rosaroten Essig vorgesetzt, den sie Schilcher nannten
– Papst Pius VI
, 1782[6]
They served us a pink vinegar, which they called Schilcher
We have a few:
> As of 2019, Austria has 10 sites inscribed on the list and a further 12 on the tentative list
Three World Heritage Sites are shared with other countries: Fertö / Neusiedlersee Cultural Landscape is shared with Hungary; Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps with France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland; and Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe with Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Ukraine
In 2017, the site Historic Centre of Vienna was inscribed on the list of World Heritage in Danger due to planned new high-rise buildings
All but one of the World Heritage Sites in Austria are of the cultural type
Ten at the moment
* [Oldtown of Salzburg]
* [Schönbrunn Palace]
* [Cultural region Salzkammergut]
* [Semmering Railway]
* [Oldtown of Graz]
* [Wachau Valley]
* [Lake Neusiedl]
* [Inner city of Vienna]
* [Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps]
* [Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]
> I’d say the most famous is the Aachener Dom
Really
I'd say it's by far the Kölner Dom
I‘m not a believer, but love to have a peek into all kinds of churches, temples and stuff
And Modena‘s Cathedral is my all time favourite
It‘s not huge or fancy, but it has its very distinct charisma
Old and cosy, yet so much inside
Love it
Because there is only one correct answer
Team cebolla
In Austria pancakes are called Palatschinken and the donut without a hole is a Krapfen
Other food-related words that come to mind are tomatoes (Paradeiser instead of Tomaten) and potatoes (Erdäpfel or Grundbirnen instead of Kartoffeln)
Some people also call strawberries Ananas instead of Erdbeeren, but that's mostly old people and I think it stems from the latin name fragaria x ananassa
Edit: And if you chop up Palatschinken to make soup with them they are called Frittaten all of a sudden, and the soup is called Frittaten-Suppe
> Some people would use the word Pfannkuchen for a Berliner
Which is a Krapfen
Why not just pronounce it the way you say cone
Or is that a contentious topic as well
That's why I'm atheist
It has nothing to do with ham dude
Plactenta (Latin for cake) -> palacsinta -> Palatschinke
With Palatschinken at least I thought it's the other way round - sounds more slavic than german to me
Does u/porcupineporridge agree on this
If they do, why make saying scone harder than it needs to be, since there's just an s more at the start
It sure is
Krapfen is quite German as far as I know, but Palatschinken came into German from the latin Placenta via Hungarian, Czech and Romanian
Oh, I've heard German tourists order "Einen Palat-Schinken bitte" in my favourite restaurant
Cracked me up
Easy
I’d go with the word by word translation and call it Eastempire
Fucking fierce and no more confusion with kangarooland
Austrialia
Just to sow more confusion
Austria = Eastrealm
Eastrick or Austrick
Hear me out
Just taking German Österreich is a bit hard and has an Umlaut
The Old High German name of the original core land was Ostarrichi ("Eastern Realm"), that's a bit anachronistic, but a starting point to reconstruct the name into modern English
Austria is the Latinized name for Austria, usually used in Romance languages
English adopted this name for our land, I guess, with the Norman conquest
The Old English name was *Ēastrīce* (East Realm)
Now lets see how the name has developed in other Germanic languages: Swedish Österrike, Danish Østrig, Frisian Eastenryk, Faroe Eysturríki, Norwegian Austerrike, Dutch Oostenrijk, Scots Austrick, Icelandic Austurríki
(I'd add the Germanic language closest to German, namely Yiddish, [but I don't know how to read Hebrew letters]
The "east" syllable seems to be is more or less consistent, and it also appears like this in old English
However the "austr" part also seems to be common northwest Germanic influenced languages
The "rick" part I am taking from the closest languages to English: Frisian and especially Scots
Also, compared the Anglisations of German(ic) names like Fried**rich** to Frede**rick**
Austrian Empire, this might sound like i am a fascist/monarchist but "Österreich" has empire in its name and it makes translations weird (even thought this is kind of true, dont take it serious, i would not want the name changed)
There's a common name in Austria that comes from Hungary called Horvath
I wonder if it comes originally from croatia
The more accurate literal translation would be Eastern Realm
The first mention of Ostarrichi was 996, back then it was part of the duchy of Bavaria, so it was neither a kingdom nor an empire at that time; it was a realm (= Reich), that was positioned in the very Eastern part of the Holy Roman Empire
edit: grammar
Eastempire
I could really work with that
maybe the original east german empire or east Germany
Comment so i don't forget to check for the ragecomment of a moravian that will come in a few hours
Thank you Lowlander
Uhm
Don’t know what you learned in history but this might trigger something
Thank you Vespuccian
yeah that's a *great* idea, make the new name fucking long like the last one so nobody will care to use it, *again*!
Or Netherlish (English)
Again I'm surprised how terrible my written Spanish is compared to my spoken one
I thought it was called "Ne*d*erlandés".
In German it's Krawatte, while Croat is Kroate, but in Austrian dialect we say Krawod, which sounds again like Krawatte
yeah but because L2-speakers always try to overcompensate and don't care to take the same shortcuts that a native would
took me a few years of struggling with "cloth-s" before I realized natives just say fuck orthography, and call it "cloze" instead
not really hard then: clozehorse
Norge sounds like it has an emphasis on the e :/
people ITT: apparently not knowing the option of choosing a weird/fun/interesting name as the second or third name
Actually sounds pretty coo tbh
I also really like that name
I try to avoid them since I'm not a fucking billboard and don't see why I should even pay more to be one
But in general you'll see loads, your ex roommate must've lived in a special bubble if that's how he perceived it
Personally, I don't like them, but I highly doubt that this is true for a majority of Europeans
At least where I live most people don't give a fuck

Apparently
Loads and loads of north face jackets and logo-ed polos here
That's exactly my opinion as well
It's no surprise to me, that items from international brands often are more expensive the smaller/less noticeable their logo is

2 things i take away from here:
1) it's good to have a reality check for your romantic views on other countries
2) expectations towards Austria seem to be really low, if no-one here is disappointed in us :D fits us perfectly
Na they aren't that low, it's just that Austria as a country will never be as idolized as Italy or France for instance, so people won't ever be that disappointed
Get over here and we'll throw a shrimp on the barbie
Pretty spot on :) read the last bit as 'retarded-ish' first
i guess 'retired-ish' is still correct
This "socialist utopia" you are talking about is such an american concept
Almost no-one in europe views socialism as something to aspire to
On the other hand most of us are social-democratic, which is a very different thing but always gets mixed up by americans
I blame your education system
Yes, at least a washing machine
in most apartment buildings people have their own washing machine, not all though
Personally i never lived anwyhere, or seen an apartment, withouth a washing machine
Seems terribly inconvenient, not to have that
I've seen Bernie Sanders being called a socialist so many times by americans even though he just wants a similar system as we have here, so don't tell me nobody thinks of europe as a socialist utopia
A lot of your conservatives call europe an utopia for socialists
I'm 26
Who wants a socialist/communist government is the important question
Of course I'd like a socialist society
That would be very nice
But have you ever looked at any attempt to build a country based on either
All of them have failed due to the greed of a few, which mostly were the leading class/government
I was a convinced socialist 10 years ago, but then I have studied the realities of those governments and where they have failed
And in my opinion a socialist country is just not sustainable anymore
I'm still very much a leftie, I have just abandoned my idealistic hopes and dreams for a more realistic idea of a country with a very strong social net and regulated capitalism
Free market and free capitalism like in the US is not the way to go, since this allows for monopolies that can control the market
I dont See a problem with it either
Have a similar arrangement since my flat is too small for a machine with a washer and dryer in the basement
But it's definitely not the norm
There's some buildings who have a basement like that but most apartments have their own setup nonetheless
just curious: where in italy is the surname Costa from
or where does it appear the most
No, if it is about English alone
Yes if it is about German-speaking people who think it's cool to mix 20% English and 80% German into their sentences
Or ads that are like that
No more than about threads asking if we are annoyed by it
I don't know, i really enjoy the English language for several reasons, one being its simplicity
I find myself even speaking it to myself (aloud or in my head), although i have no idea how or why that all started
Maybe out of laziness to use the German language, which can be cumbersome at times
And it often sounds kinda harsh
So, no, i'm not annoyed at all
I'm happy that's it's the universal language because it's really easy
I don't mind
What does bother me though is people saying English is such an easy language
Sure the grammar is easy, but when it comes to pronunciation it's like you decided "fuck it, we don't need rules". Entitled native speakers really are infuriating
Learning another language is always hard
Or you know, making fun of accents
Our brains are shaped by our first language
If the other language has sounds that are not part of you first language you will probably never learn to speak them correctly
Also a lot of people in this thread complain about English loan words
Of course we use a lot of English words
Just look at how many French words we still use (Niveau, Adresse, Büro, etc) because it once was the lingua franca
And yes some words will be used incorrectly or change their meaning
Just live with it
So many of our German words have different roots, we don't even realise
And it is the same in other language
English has some German words too (Kindergarten, Gesundheit, Rucksack, Poltergeist, Blitzkrieg,...)
Wir müssen die deutsche sprache streamlinen um value zu adden
You know that you use German words too
I doubt that any language in the world uses their own language exclusively
There are always influences from other languages
Spitze of the morgens to ya
I find this very interesting, the spelling of some of those words is extremely similar to the actual pronounciation in Styrian dialects of Austria
Hans Solo sounds like an the name of an Austrian Schlager musician
It's funny how her Adidas is spot on correct and her pronunciation of Nike is just wrong in the same way as the Germans do it wrong
It's like she learned how to pronounce it from somebody from Germany
Given that the company is actually named after Nike then a German, who were to read the company name as any other German word would actually be closer to the [actual pronunciation] of the ancient Greek goddess than any American or British
But as mentioned in the video the founder of Nike can choose to pronounce it however the fuck he wants
Actively at the moment
But Hungary isn't moving in a direction that makes them great neighbours to have

This is no joking matter
I guess you mean the death of Ögedei Khan in 1241
They were also very close to Vienna already, when the Khan died
How the death of one person can change the entire course of history is amazing sometimes
This doesn't exist in Austria, as far as I know (if you don't count Tirol and especially Vorarlberg, where Italian is common due to their geography
I can speak some Yiddish but not school level
I speak a very distinct, small german dialect from the south of Salzburg, yes
So just a regular german dialect like most of us Austrians or is it something special
I got that
But some Austrian dialects (like in Lungau) are a bit special and spoken by very few people
The normal dialects are spoken by nearly everyone and are not a minority language
Germany is the country that is the culturally and politically closest to us
Our nominal neutrality doesn't mean anything
We are a small, ineffectual country that relies on our European neighbors and NATO to defend us
The british are way worse at admiting this
Doesn't matter, Austria (same as Switzerland+Liechtenstein) is surrounded by NATO members and safely tucked into the whole NATO-EU military framework
Completely delusional to think a country in our situation can be truly neutral
I think it was a mixed bag for Czechoslovakia
You ended up with 50 years of communism, but at least we gave you a convenient justification to finally get rid of your unruly German-speaking population
Considering everyone says "not much" and regrets it, why don't we do a cultural exchange thing in r/Europe again

I want the templer ottoman vs the assassine viennese in the second siege of vienna
Templer help the ottoman cause the emperor hiddes some artifact or something
Well, I suppose you could make an assassins creed that leads to a world war
Around 1800, during the era of fin-de-siecle or shortly before, at the height of the Danube Monarchy, when Vienna was a cosmopolitan hotspot
You'd sneak through lavish balls and assassinate rich aristocrats and industry magnates, sabotage the construction of some nobleman's palais along the Ring avenue, blend into the crowd while eavesdropping on some artists or scientists debating in one of the coffee houses, visit doctor Freud's office and go riding through the green and hilly countryside around the city
Damn, now I want this
Uhm
hard question for Austrians since basically everything leads to a world war
My first thought was an assassins creed before WW1 that ends in sarajevo with killing Franz Ferdinand, because honestly there are way to many games about Hitler and WW2 already
My second thought would be a wholesome one where you just go from Heurigen to Heurigen and drink some wine with your buddies
I guess thats what i prefer
1913: Alternate timeline in which some guy in a hoodie kills hitler, stalin, tito, trotsky and freud
I thought the same, it's such an iconic era and would be quite different from what they already did
You could also travel to different locations in the empire, Prague, Budapest, Bad Ischl, Grado
I mean, it's a great era, but it's also *the* wellknown Viennese era
Something a bit more unknown would be great
Someone suggested Nazi era Praha above - I think with AC's map sizes one could easily make a Resistance game that covers Czech and Austrian territories
And could showcase the complicated alliances and networks of people
Ah yes
An AC Viennese Version would be lovely
I want to see some asassin throwing someone out of a window in prag
I myself haven't seen the movie but apparently many people I know watch it on Christmas Eve, i don't know why
Edit: I forgot to answer the other question: a widely spread Christmas tradition for many people in Austria is watching "drei Haselnüsse für Aschenbrödel" even though the movie itself also doesn't really have anything to do with Christmas either
We usually watch any of the die hard movies
Yes, I watch it every year with my dad

* Hinterwäldler (people living behind the woods)
* PS: Mostschädel - most = apple wine, schädel = head (a person who drinks too much apple wine)
* PS2: Schluchtenscheißer (canyon shitters) for mountain folk
Proleten
Fpö Wähler
I heard Schluchtenscheißer only from Germans for Austrians in General
And im kinda disappointed if Viennese People use it, its not very creative
And Mostschädel, well originally its a derogatory term used by the people of Innviertel (which came to Austria with a bavarian density of breweries while the rest of Austria drank "Most") for the rest of Austria or especially the despised rest of Upper Austria
Sandler
What about Sandler
Krocher mit Kapuzenwesten
what
these are surprisingly wrong
a redneck is not the same as a "country bumpkin", in your examples the defining connotation of lower social class is completely missing
one of the examples we don't even use ourselves, it's a derogatory demonym used for Austrians by Germans
keeping in mind the examples that OP gave, there's only one correct answer really: the Austrian version of chav/gopnik/redneck/Asi would be a **Prolo**, short from **Prolet**, a [member of the proletariat] [other example]
Sauproleten
Proleten are mainly low class city ppl though, not country ppl like rednecks
Nope, only for those living in the mountains (i.e. south-west)
Tyrolians, Salzburgers, Carinthians, Styrians
Those four
> Viennese People use it, its not very creative
Never heard it used in Vienna, it's not a Viennese word, we have a whole dictionary of more original Viennese Beleidigungen, so not sure why it made OP's list
Sure, someone somewhere uses it in Austria, but it's probably not within the top 10 mild insults a Wiener will use
it's decidedly foreign, no worries
never heard it being used here
country bumpkins are still called Landeier last time I checked
A Sandler is a homeless person, not the same as a redneck
The English equiv would be hobo, in that case (not redneck)
guess I don't have to ask where you live
Gopniks aren't just rual either, quite the opposite in fact
fair enough
Viennese definitely aren't.
Germans are clearly very bad at local geography

I recently learned some Norwegian and it was surprising how close it was to German (especially Austrian German)
Most interesting was probably bus driver: Buschauffeur in Austrian German and bussjåfør in bokmål.
Overall, I get the sense of longer written texts from the context - but if it's just a few words (like a street sign) and I don't understand of the words it's impossible
Dutch is similar, understand written but listening to it is quite hard
Dutch is german spoken by a drunk englishmen and written down by someone who had a stroke while doing so
You get what it's about but that's about it
But it's a matter of training
I don't decipher Swedish regularly so it's much harder than when you're confronted with it more often
I can tell you what the article is about but can't go into too much detail
But yes written Swedish is actually easier than Danish imho
perfect time to get "sich ausgehen" (eine Ressource, die für ein Vorhaben ausreicht, sowohl zeitlich als auch räumlich etc) under your belt
that's the one that's *always* tripping me up when speaking German-German, along with what to say for Lavoir/Schaffel (... Waschbehältnis
Ah, haven't heard beigehen before, the more you know
How would you use that, "Gehen wir bei Zerglinge zu produzieren
"? Sounds kinda complicated instead of "lass uns". :)
Oh, and [this] is a Lavoir
Interesting, the way you use it, it nearly sounds like the meaning could be defined as "vorbeigehen, vorbeischauen bei". Eventuell noch wie "zur Hand gehen"?

Reasons for dating romanian women: They're beautiful
Reasons not to date Romanian women : They might impale you ass first if you wrong them
Thanks, now I'm terrified and attracted
Fairly common in Transylvania/Western part of Romania
You would usually find schools where they teach the romanian curricula almost fully in German or in Hungarian
In big cities (also in the eastern part) you will also find schools that teach in “international” languages like English, French or Spanish, but locally you’d also find other minority language schools for Serbians, Bulgarians, Ukrainians or even Slovaks
You don’t have to belong to a minority group to be able to study in such a school, so that a lot of Romanians attend them in order to make sure they learn another language in depth
Especially the students of schools that teach widespread languages are perceived as having better chances of attaining a higher paid job, as the foreign language ones are usually one of the better (high)schools in town
Simultaneously, they are also the most likely ones to emigrate
At school level it's quite rare
On University level it's quite common to teach in English
English isn‘t an option here, it’s one if the main subjects every single school no matter what and every class has
From year 1 to year 13
My class teacher back then was an english and history teacher so she quite often taught history in english
But I think other than this it‘s not common at all
Prob because no subject will merge into another or will do stuff another subject should teach
(Eg musical history is only for Music
Not for History
Edit: I‘m going to an engineering school so I barely have any other languages other than english
Maybe people who are going to/went to schools with more languages can agree/disagree with this
Edit 2: Universities that teach in english are extremely common tho
I went to an exclusive german speaking school in Oradea
As an Austrian I was obviously very lucky as a kid that I was able to talk my own native tongue at school :)
Some should have as well
Don't know about the Burgenland Croats, [but there's a least one Gym for Carinthian Slovenes]
AFAIK in German-majority Südtirol regular subjects are all in German and Italian is taught as a separate subject from the beginning and in Italian-majority Trentino it's vice versa
I guess there's also schools where it is 50:50
And ofc both regions have schools were it is vice versa for the respective minorities
Don't know how it works in the Ladino areas though
They are kind of a language minority surrounded by Italian and German speakers who might or might not be a minority themselves
On the contrary
We want to get rid of some provinces, but can't.
We have the FPÖ right wing party, which is struggling to separate itself from common sense
I'd say they're more than half way there
Austrian here, we want to get fucking rid of Vienna but they just won’t leave
;-)
Yeah, but cutting out Vienna will be really hard you know
More of like A Vatican situation in Rome then
Keep it for tourists and it‘s full of weird people in beautiful buildings
Well, I was semi kidding
But our westernmost federal state once wanted to join Switzerland, only Switzerland didn't want them
only as a joke
we really dont want to
no, Vorarlberg is one of the wealthier and most beautiful areas
Some people joke about giving back Burgenland to Hungary
But it has nice Wine and food, it is mostly banter between the states :D
That gives a whole new meaning to the [Pacific War]
My favourite example for this is *dragon* and *kite*. In German both words are *Drache*.
Oh my glob that's cool
I wish we had that in German
adding "Mist" to that; might only be in Austrian German though
Ha I got a better one for English speakers: poison & venom = gift ;)
>We usually just say "fuck it
"Soldier
Take the fuck it and do your job
they do collapse again in informal speech, at least down South:
Ich lerne X.
Ich lerne ihm Y.
"Ich lehre ihm" sounds crazy formal here
Here in Austria both are pronounced literally the same
> Though kinda as a side note; At least for Sweden, the English knowledge is often overstated to my experience
Not the quantity, but the quality
A lot of people have insufficient knowledge in day-to-day topics
That's the problem with most of these "English proficiency" ratings - they usually use the answers of people who already take a test and are willing to improve their skill
If there were an EU-mandated English proficiency survey, it would yield much worse results
Damn Germans with their stupid dubbing
They drag us down with them
I don't really identify with any of that, to be honest
Exploring nature
Riding my bicycle around the village
With my friends back then, we used to build 'houses' in the forest out of sticks
Some of them turned out to be quite functional
At home it was legos or playing pokemon on my gameboy color
Parents were not in favor of videogames back then so time on the latter was limited haha
Great times
Watching tv, playing lego/with barbies, running around in the forest, playing with other children in the village, going around by bike
A real redditor
From head to toe
Very similar
My parents didn't like video games, so we always played at my friend's place
Also, two of my friends had huuuge model train setup, which was cool
Can relate to the seasons being endless
Also, summer holidays seemed to contain a whole lifetime
> trading football stickers to make your sticker album full\
I still haven't recovered from those financial losses
I'm struggling with the "R" in just about every word, I just can't pronounce it properly
For example when I wann say "are" it sounds like "awe", or "Rock and Roll" sounds like "Wockn and Woll"
By now I think I‘ve learned to pronounce most of the english words (sometimes „three“ makes me stumble) but I remember avoiding using „thorough“ for  years because I couldn‘t pronounce it
Squirrel is definitely the one that took me the longest to sound somewhat like a native would sound
well, if you talk to native speakers you'll hear anything from very by the book water to woa-dah
In my dialect it’s „Oachkatzl“.
I had the same issue, until someone told me "Queue" is just "Q" with "ueue" waiting line
maybe that helps you too
Nice I like tom scott, i'll check it out, thanks mate
Der ist nur dabei wenn wir den Deutschen ein Wort geben, dass sie dann nachsprechen sollen

As an Austrian, I feel connected to other "small neighbour countries", like Ireland or New Zealand
They share the language with their bigger neighbour, their culture might be related, but there are some profound differences that seem minor from the outside, but are a big part of the identity
I think it depends
Our rural area seems to be similar to Canada's just without the bears (and whatever else they have)
Of course it is a neighbor country but I have to mention Switzerland
Austria seems to be an in between of Germany and Switzerland
Of course everyone has individual opinions
City-like
I don't know
Like most of European cities I guess
And outside Europe
that's difficult
We don't have many high buildings/skyscrapers (tho some more are going to be built atm) that makes it a bit difficult I think
To the other Austrians: What do you think
Sofia seems eerily similar to Vienna in terms of how the city "feels" like
Prolly mostly due to Vienna exporting their architects there for a while
Costa Rica felt surprisingly close in some aspects to Austria
(Relatively) rich, small but not tiny country in the center of a continent, touristy, relatively strong focus on organic stuff and renewables
Of course there are also quite some differences, but looking at other central american countries in comparison, CR really stands out
Mentality and culture wise countries or regions that used to be part of the Empire are usually also closer than a lot of Austrians realize (often even closer than Germans), the language barrier is real though
I think it’s hard to say, of course the neighboring countries look similar landscape-wise, all the cities that were build during the habsburg monarchy kinda look the same, doesn’t matter if you are in Slovenia or Hungary or Austria, think the yellow churches for example
I think minus the catholic aspect the UK might be similar
Both used to be way bigger empires, kinda dark humor, one big tourist attractor city, smaller industry-heavy cities, lots of space for agriculture but at the same time basically no dangerous wild animals, cuisine is meat and potato-heavy, often when people think about the prime of the countries they think of past times, they share a language with a bigger country and it’s basically the same but certain words are different and people point it out a lot, ... but that’s just my two cents
Oh right
Thanks for the addition
I wouldn't call them "far away" though, with the exception of Mexico (which wasn't part of Austria for very long at all
For me it would be the [Grimming] The highest isolated peak in Europe
Quite an impressive view from the plain
At the border of the last foothills of the alps and the minor hungarian depression
On a good day you can scale one of the hills and see two European capitals, Vienna and Bratislava
Does it have to be in my own country
Across the border in Northern Italy there's the so-called [Erdpyramiden (earth pyramids)] which are quite awesome and unique-looking
One I could think of on the spot is maybe [Der Grüne See/Green Lake]
It‘s special because in summer the ice from the Hochschwab Mountains which surrounds it melts and fills the lake and it reaches it‘s maximum depth of 12m (39 ft)
In winter the water recedes and the lake is almost empty
There‘s a little bench in the middle of the lake where you can sit on in winter and scuba dive down to in summer
I don‘t know why that was the first thing I thought of
And for Austria I will always say Tiergarten Schönbrunn, the worlds oldest zoo
And the first zoo that had a naturally bred panda baby born in the very same zoo
Along with one out of 10 european zoos that‘s actually allowed to keep pandas and protect them
And as for nature only, the alps, for obvious reasons
Immediatly, I thought this must be great for bouldering/climbing
Wow, so far I have had exactly 1online lesson
It was a 3hour lesson about paper production

"Po" means butt in German, so the Po river is the butt river to us
Also Austria, and sounds funny in Austria/German: Kotzendorf (vomit village), Grünz bei Schweinern (oink at pigen), Hühnergeschrei (hen's screams), Einöd (barren/deserted place), there's a few more I can't think of right now
we also have gaming and eisenwurzn wich basiclly translates to ironshit

Our arch dukes chauffeur drove a different way, than he was supposed to
[Kaprun disaster (2000)]
A funicular train caught fire because of a design fault and 155 people died mainly because the doors could only be opened by the operator
Probably the [Kaprun disaster 2000] A funicular burned in a tunnel on a mountain
155 people died, 12 survived
The fire was triggered by a faulty fan heater
A lack of safety mechanisms on the train and shitty escape routes resulted in the high death toll
Weren't more people killed and injured in the train crash of Eschede
Yep
The day I was born
You even ignored the: "never trust an austrian"-rule a second time
Yeah me too
How would history have changed if Ferdls chauffeur wouldn't have gotten lost
How would the modern world be
Hell how even would the fronts have been in the great war - would there have even been a ww2 the way it was
Not particularly
At a funeral I would follow all the religious rituals and whatnot out of respect for the dead but generally no
No not really, I think it‘s the usual „I‘m sorry“ or something like that
When my grandma died my brother didn‘t go to church either because he‘s very non-religious and during her lifetime none of my family had a good relationship to her (she hated all of us most of her lifetime, and when she got into an elder care home (idk what to call it) she did get a little bit better but I believe she still hated my mom and my brother didn‘t meet her either during that time), so it‘d feel insincere to play sad when somebody you had no relation to during their living times died
I wouldn‘t‘vd gone either, if I‘m being honest, if it wasn‘t for my mom and my dad forcing me to because they think it‘d be bad for our image if none of their children went
And also I‘d be a disrespectful bitch [it sounds nicer in our language] if I didn‘t go

It's white outside
But I'm fairly far up a mountain and on the "shadow" side
When I look out of the window and see the other side of the valley, where the sun shines a lot more, they don't have any snow
Went sledding just yesterday
No, and it is absolutely frustrating
I love snow and I have a little child - that its not snowing breaks my heart
Live at the beginning of the Alps, but in a valley
It has snowed three times that were measurable
We still have a little bit of snow on the ground where there is shade most of the day
Pretty terrible winter considering at this time last year we had over a meter and a half of snow on the ground
It has snowed twice here in Vienna but the snow was gone within 24 hours both times if I recall
In my hometown at 600 metres there is no snow
You have to travel around the 1000 metre mark to get artificial snow and 1500 to meet real snow on slopes
other than slopes there's little to speak of
Same here in southern Sweden :(
We live on the outskirts of the alps but we do get our fair share of snow, normally
There hasn't been a closed snowcover at all this year
It's.. weird
Where do you live
I got a closed snowcover in my hometown
Second biggest city
Nice
I live in the biggest Bezirk on 1100 Höhenmeter, but we don't even have much snow here
It's enough to go skiing at least :)
Judging by the incredible amount of teleshopping asvertisement on German TV I would think that this business is doing really okay
Foreign minister Figl [presenting the freshly signed state treaty] from the balcony of the Belvedere palace in 1955
It re-established Austria as a sovereign nation and concluded 10 years of allied occupation
I dont know what to think about Figl
On the one Hand he was a proponent of Dollfuß and the "Ständestaat" but then again he suffered quite a lot at Dachau
Was whipped to a Pulp and was judged to dark and solitary confinment for 6 months for using the word "Austria".
But then he again he drank molotov under the table,
I thought of exactly the same picture
IMHO the proclamation of the first Republic [had a more iconic pic]
While I do appreciate his resistance against Nazi Germany and later redemption as a now democratic figure and supporter of a multi party state I think that his support of Austrofascism, antiparliamentarism and his leadership role in the Austrian variant of the SA were way too easily forgotten
Generally the conservatives in Austria didnt get enough shit postwar for basically serving the nation on a platter for the Germans with them normalizing authoritarianism, political violence and dictatorship in 1934
But then again we didnt even really cleanse actual still ideological Nazis acting as judges, professors and prosecutors postwar
And he pulls a bottle of gasoline, lights the contract on fire and proclaims himself Emperor

My physics teacher really hated me and wanted me to fail really bad - she already managed that I got the worst grade so I had to make a special exam in autumn to be able to stay in my class
Then she asked me there a lot of stuff we never talked about
Luckily there were two other teachers present to which I complained about this showing them the notes of the three best students in class I borrowed
They went through it and told the teacher that this exam is invalid and she had to ask me different questions which they checked in the notes
12AM is noon and 12PM is midnight
This was my high school English teacher, who, upon me correcting her, told me I needed to get my ego in check and just “think about it” then I’d see why she was right
I brought in proof
Didn’t believe me still
She probably still teaches it like that too
I hated her
She was an AWFUL teacher
We were talking about multiethnic states
And she wouldn't accept the US but was totally fine with Spain
I know there are different ethnicities in Spain but still, nothing compared to the US
My brothers history teacher this year:
The Nazis were actually more like the social democrats just look at their party program
They have little in common with the FPÖ (the far right Austrian with all our Neonazis in it)
The "coloureds" were better off because they were colonized because they only got culture through the Europeans
Greta Thurnberg and the climate activists are "climate stalinists"
My physics teacher insisted that work is a vector
I had a biology teacher explain to my class what transsexuality is, but the thing she was actually explaining was intersexuality
I mean it's nice if she's trying to teach us about it but seriously, if you're trying to do that then do it right and don't teach your students who believe everything you say BS
Sadly I didn't find the courage to correct her, now I wish I had spoken up
Edit: spelling
A physics teacher in HTL (school for the Last 5 years of school with more emphasis in tech)
And i do not know, how she passed at uni, but all this is the same person
1) told us, at age 17, and after having two years of chemics at this school already (and mostly At previous school also) a great an new science developement: there are Atoms, and everything contains it
(And was surprised, we where not as as giddy and astonished about it, as she was)
2) the ancient agypts are at fault,  because there are no woods on the pyramids,  because they cut all the trees, that were growing on them (on a human made building
... but she really believed it)
Such ideas centered around the English language are funny
Like when people say that "Slav" and "slave" are related

Ah, yes
Austria, where teachers can literally fail you because they don’t like you
Politics teacher in high school tried that with me too
Our system is fucked
I guess deaf people can't think either
It's still so weird
When you start counting with 1 PM, then 2 PM ... the logical thing would be that 12 PM comes last, not first
To be completely honest, 12AM vs 12PM is retarded
I don't know which is which and I refuse to look it up, but I do remember it was totally counter-intuitive to me
Go find some other way to talk about those times of the day ... 24h clock face, "noon", "midnight", whatever ...
Well, in early days, billiard balls were in fact made of ivory
But it turned out to be not durable enough (and too expensive), so they invented a special kind of resin at some time in the 19th century
You saw it coming ...
She was/is still incorrect
Like, yeah it may be more complex than that, but I was still right lol
She explained it by saying since pm is for late things and am is for early things
Like that's just a bullshit explanation
She was easily the most stupid teacher I ever had, and that says a lot, because I had maybe 3 actually capable teachers in my entire Austrian middle and high school career
That was just the tip of her stupid iceberg
One time she took off points for a correct answer on a test and when I brought in proof that I was correct she just shrugged
But if you look at the 24hr system we use, we start counting at midnight (00:00) too, so then it makes sense again . But it definitely is weird
Oh yeah I get you
I personally would like to strangle any nationalist history teacher in Austria
Most of them are borderline Neonazis or reproduce Nazi rhetoric
many unironic
It's better these days
Back in the day the teachers had to create their own end exams, which you need to go to uni
You can imagine why this might be a bad idea I think
Variation of difficulty was insane
No it isn‘t? Up until the Matura, teachers have ALL the power because the system lets them make up grades based on their own individual made up rules
It’s AWFUL
That’s not what she meant though
She meant early as in light out
She was stupid
I don't know how so many people are so bad at geography
Almost everyone knows austria as a german-speaking country
Almost everyone knows that we got anschlussed by germany during ww2
And almost everyone knows where germany is
But my class was once in england and we got the job to ask a few people a few questions one being where is austria
(We gave them a blank map from europe for this)
The lists of nations we got as answers: norway, nederlands, belgium, luxenbourg, poland, hungary (was the most common answer), switzerland, bosnia, slovenia, belarus, ukraine,(estonia,latvia,lithuania,kaliningrad (this 4 were one guy who was 100% shure that we are trolling him that it isn't one of them, espessially when we said "no thats russia" when he pointed at kaliningrad)) and tunis (north africa was also shown on the map)
Out of 50 people (10 teams everyone had to ask 5 people or groups of people) 3 got austria right (and one of them who got it right was a spanish woman, the other people we asked were english) (technicly 4 got it right but the 4th one got helped by some guy that was asked the question before by another group)
I don‘t know if it can represent my country but I can remember one that happened in 2020:
* Some guy with a Machete and in Lederhosen went to the Hofburg (where our presidents office is) and said he wanted to talk to our president
I think somewhere there was a bomb threat around spring or summer
They were starlings which are a huge pest
Pigeons are annoying and dirty
Starlings destroy tons of food every year
Oof shit really happened in 2020 for us
10°C is "ok, time to put on a shirt" weather in the nordic countries I assume
They mostly attack fruits
Not just monocultures but also fruit trees from small farmers
But yeah, it's obviously not the birds fault
Der Panther - Maria Rilke
I think
Oder der Zauberlehrling
Was willst du mit dem Dolche sprich
This one is pretty iconic as well I think
Fest gemauert in der Erden Steht die Form aus Lehm gebrannt
Das also war des Pudels Kern
Well ,if there is one foreign movie that does NOT portray my county by any means: The sound of music
You're telling me this isn't an accurate representation
Sil Maria and Personal Shopper are insanely good films, but I think it doesn't have much to do with Switzerland at all
Hitler salute at our concentration camp memorial sites
Its stupid, disparages the victims and is just plainly disgusting
Them getting huge fines is satisfying though
Edit: many culprits are not outright neonazis but stupid (mostly male) students visting the sites as part of a school trip
Many others are though but mostly homegrown ones
Don't go into the mountains unprepared
And check the weather before you do
We have deaths every year from people going into the Alps like it's a giant theme park
Don't call us German, you won't make any friends
Refering to us as german is the best way of getting yourself killed
Generally never compare us with germany except if you are comparing us with something bavarian
If you are in an area that isn't a typical tourist region you shouldn't even be german if you don't want that everyone makes fun of you
Stand on the left side of an escalator
It's virtually suicide
A Tourist should never hitler around or order schnitzel with saucer
What also shouldnt be done is returning 60 bottles at once
The people behind you in the queue dont appreciate it
Are your politicians aware of this
I chuckled
Here, you can't go into a public sauna with a bathing suit on
It's considered to be unhygienic
Ok England
"Luxury"?
More like "some good products for average people, and a lot of trash".
&#x200B;
The food is more popular than the rest, yes; some people even regularly go to Ikea just to eat
&#x200B;
I have no idea if they have a slogan here, but I'm pretty ad-blind in general (luckily)
Barely ever been to one, it‘s kind of on the same rank (or maybe even outranked
) by the  other furniture companies like Möbelix, Mömax, XXLutz, etc
But generally, if one of your furniture breaks „Ikea furniture“ is often used to describe it, afaik
> Calling stuff gay
Yeah, that's so retarded
Yeah I really enjoyed it, but it's by no means a masterpiece
it's just an in your face, dumbed down version of films like Taxi Driver for the 21st century audience
It's hollow compared to the films that influenced it
The films message is clearly stated, and at some points I felt the film was saying: "this is what it's about, do you get it you dumb fuck
That being said it's well made and as always Joaquin Phoenix's acting is stellar
I can understand why, I haven't rewatched it since I saw it in the cinema and I went in expecting the usual DC shit
I guess that helps
Have you seen 'the Lighthouse'? It's a 'the Shining'-esque but not in the way 'Joker' is 'Taxi driver'-esque, imo it's the best film of 2019 (of the ones I've seen)
I think it was the scenes with the psychiatrist that felt particularly on the nose
I can't remember exactly what she said, but something along the lines of "they don't care about people like you, and they don't care about people like me" after finding out that he will have to pay for his own therapy/medication
In real life a psychiatrist is there so you can speak freely and be helped through your struggles, but using that in a film to have the main character be able to spell out exactly how they feel, and why they feel that way seemed a bit cheap
Show don't tell, especially as they had shown all that stuff anyway I don't think there was a need to tell it as well
I hope that makes sense haha
My country doesn't have them because we are (ostensibly) neutral
But the fact is that at least militarily, Europe is basically a US vassal
It's our current political world and we gotta live with it
Could be much worse
We don't have any in our own country, but honestly, I prefer to be influenced by the Americans compared to the other alternative
China
We're a small country, so some outside influence is inevitable, so I'm going to throw my weight behind a country that's actually democratic, not some Authoritarian state
[What is our life worth
so glad we have none of that shite
Pfuh, dort wirst ja ordentlich zerlegt ;)
I wish we were more independent from the US
I think they need someone who is equally strong as a counterweight
The US is not reliable enough, especially not with Trump
And they are way too powerful and regularly abuse that power
I definitely don't want them here in Austria
The US doesn't have 'reeducation camps' though
Also the political culture and freedom of the press are basically nonexistent in China
It's just a worse country to be influenced by in every possible way
As an Austrian, I tend to say: "Mehlspeisen". So baked sweets like cakes and stuff
We have a HUGE variety of different sorts with the Sachertorte being the most famous one
If I’m honest I refuse to eat Schnitzel outside of Austria
Maybe it‘s just me, maybe it‘s just the feeling of home, maybe it‘s really better in Austria
Austrian cheese is the best :3
In Vienna, we get our tap water directly from springs in the alps
It's better than many bottled brands
Danish ice cream is second to none
One Word
Mohnnudeln
(sachertorte is overrated)
In German, we sometimes use the word "Aufschnitt" for various sliced meats (sausage, ham, etc)
Its just a trick some waiters pull on annoying tourists
I have never paid for tap water
I guess it has something to do with general tastes
It's also the milder French cheeses that are sold around here
The demand for strong special cheeses is there but not mainstream
The problem has to be your houses pipes
There is no way there is undrinkable water in the water reservoir
The EU law is incredibly strict on that
Go right up to the border, that's what i did anyway, i think it was on one of islands in the Wattenmeer
Quargel (similar to your Handkäse) and Glundner Käse ist pretty exotic and strong
As Kid my favourite cheese was "Steirer Glundner" and you basically can't get it outside Styria and Carinthia (where it's called Kärntner Käse)
People often just prefer what they are used to
I dont think that this is arrogance, but only natural that peoples taste gets shaped by their surroundings
I just dont like most Belgian beers, even through my Belgian friends swear by them
Same for other dark beers
I also dont like strawberry flavoured Ales
I also think that it is unfair to compare big brands to small, local ones
How many beers from small breweries in Austria have you tasted
Probably none, and thats only natural
Bin Kärntner und mag fast alles, liebe fast jeden Käse, aber Glundner
puh
Keiner stinkt schöner
I have a Polish grocery store around the corner
I think there's a lot Poles living in my neighborhood
Never heard of a Polish shop or specifically Polish groceries
Yes, there are a couple in my city
And I love pierogi
It is not a single country and rather a subregion of Europe, but I am very interested in Scandinavian history
It was never mentioned in school
Most countries that were part of the Roman empire some time during its existence
Especially Italy, since it was the very heart of it
Honestly
Our own
Ever since i read "The history of the world in 100 objects" i can't answer this for one country anymore
My fascination of the interconnectedness of all of our history is so much greater than that for single, constructed frames of place or time
To me that's the real beauty of history and i wish that schools would rather focus on how all regions and aspects (technology, politics, health and desease, climate, art, etc) all work together and over time brought us to where we all are now
Nope, never heard of it
I remember the 30 Years' War, the Defenestrations of Prague etc, but I don't remember Swedens role in it all
This may be purely a mistake on my part or my bad memory, but I feel like we only talked about the First and Second World Wars (and the events leading up to both) in school for 2
5 years
I think there is a big focus on them in the curriculum due to Austrias role in both
It's been 13 years since I graduated from school
So maybe the curriculum has changed since then, but during my school days the Scandinavian countries were only mentioned in passing
The Vikings were also only mentioned when it came to the expansion of the Roman Empire in Europe
I guess a lot of my history lessons in school revolved around Austrian history, because
there is a lot to unpack, let's put it like that
I wouldn't even say that WW1 is talked about properly
WW2 is talked about basically every year
Austrian history class is not much better than American history class, with the difference that ours focuses on how shitty our country is
Yep, not gonna argue with that
In 7 years of history classes, I never had the impression of getting a complete overview of the history of humankind, but rather each teacher taught the part that they found interesting personally
let me live with the celts of Bad Dürnberg and Hallstadt, but before they were going south to piss of some romans
i really want to learn more about them, and since those guys didnt write their own history, i probably would see alot cool things nobody knew about them
High middle ages, 1100-1200 type time period
Would just be fascinating
I'd probably visit Vienna sometime during the 19th century, when it was still the capital of a great empire
Can you elaborate
Oof, pretty bad decision in hindsight
I don‘t know a single national anthem
Well, the Austrian one kind of, the first part, but otherwise not really
People don’t flex here at all
It’s almost illegal so to say
Same as Germany
We don't want people to know about our private lives
"Soko Kitzbühel", a police procedural set in the Tyrolean alps
It ran for 20 years, the last episode of around 265 will run in may
Tom Turbo has more episodes
A total of 407
That's rookie numbers
Am dam des ran for 3986 episodes
:O How could I not think of Tom Turbo ...
People from Vorarlberg are hard to understand, but it is usually manageable for me, as I'm from the neighbor state (Tyrol)
Viennese for instance do not stand a chance at understanding them
I have the same problem with the swiss - I understand it, but my brain needs a second to process the sentence I just heard and comprehend what they were saying
So it is possible but not without difficulty
A dialect I and barely anybody I know understands: Vorarlberger dialect
Probably because it‘s more closely related to Swiss german than any other Austrian dialect
And for accents: I‘m bad at accents anyway
If your accent happens to be anything that isn‘t a german accent there‘s a 99% chance I won‘t understand you because I‘m pretty stupid
I speak German
so many dialects i don't understand at all
Joa Wienr künnen üsnmeistens nid verstoh, denn wirds komisch wenn plötzlich hochdütsch reda muasch
Aba I studier in Innsbruck und ihr Tiroler hond o an schwera Dialekt, da rest fu Österreicg vertsnad i jo no guat aba bei eu wirds a jle schwera, vorallem süd udn sot tiroler
Schwizer gond eigentlich meistens zum verstoh, isch jo o allemanlisch
Are you sure that he didn‘t say anything along the lines of juten as in guten (juten Morgen, juten Tag or some shit like that) and not actually Juden
Idk I‘m just making a best case scenario right now while never having heard of Badisch tbh xD
Switzerland is a very weird place when it comes to languages, which makes it the more interesting if I‘m honest here
Now I‘m intrigued
do you actually speak standard german
Because I think it‘s quite rare to find somebody that grew up in Austria and lives in Austria to not have a dialect, like, at all (or overall find a german native that doesn‘t have a dialect at all)
I come from Niederösterreich and grew up bilingual (hungerian-german) and moved to Wien
I don't understand Tirolerisch, Kärntnerisch, Burgenland-isch(?), Vorarlbergerisch und Schweitzer dütsch
I mean what means "Hiafla
Hiafla ist ein Trottel :‘D but tbh I‘ve never heard that either (Am styrian lol)
Yes
"Steiermarkerisch" i don't get either
Steirisch  and I don‘t get lower Austrian dialect on the other hand, it‘s a „I know it but it sounds so foreign“-feeling
It still snows every winter
But in the city, not as much as it used to
Barely anymore
It snowed on Saturday in upper Styria for a day
Now we‘re happy when we see snow at the beginning of January
Sometimes we have snow at the end of February or beginning of March
It‘s sad
South-Eastern Austria here, last year in November we had record-breaking snowfall here
I'm talking once every 75 years
In only one day, my entire district (and some other neighbouring districs) was affected by blackouts, roadblocks, and potwntial avalanches
I've never seen anything like that
But, for the rest of winter we had almost no snow at all
I've noticed this trend over the last few years
Heavy snowfall before and after Winter, but hardly any during it
Which, living in the alps, obviously didn't use to be like that
Yeah I think last year it snowed once in here in Vienna iirc
We haven't got much snow in the years prior to that as well, but at least a few times, even if it is gone in a day or two
I think it really depends on the employer, but as far as I know are piercings not really accepted if you work in a bank or as attorney or jobs like that
From my experience I can say I work in a hospital in administration and so far nobody has said anything about my septum piercing
Pretty much a non-issue at this point
Maybe not in banks and higher-class establishments, but fuck em
It really depends what kind of work you do
In healthcare (think nurses for example) it's either forbidden or at least very much encouraged not to have piercings
Both for hygienic reasons as well as safety reasons (think of aggressive patients trying to rip them off etc
Same for police, guards, etc
They don't wear ties cause they could be joked, same with piercings
Mostly safety reasons
If you work a job that involves interacting with customers it depends
Banks and such probably would prefer if you don't have those, some don't care
If you work some "regular" or "boring" office job behind the scenes it is probably accepted
True, do you show your Septum on your application picture
I am wearing snakebites since 16 and i always showed it on mine
I didn't have the septum yet when I applied for the job, I actually got it one month after I started the job
But I'd probably show it if I had to apply for a new job
Almost all of Europe uses dots and/or spaces for thousands and commas for decimals
Only UK and 1-2 other countries do it otherwise
I am using the German style here
What I never was aware of is my wrong use of the "`" in English
Like: Writing "I´m" instead of "I'm", but that simply is because of the German keyboard layout and I´m too used to the wrong one
no thousand separators because they might mess things up and points for decimal
Although in German you would use a comma
I just use spaces for 1000 seperators and whatever I wanr for decimals
> Only UK and 1-2 other countries do it otherwise
And science and technology
so how do you count
here it's, in steps of 1
000:
Million - Milliarde - Billion - Billiarde
another quick question, do you actually write the currency symbol before the amount
over here it's "1,55 €" (unlike English where it's "$1
55")
glad you asked, I also just thought about that
here the use of the currency symbol is standardized in an ÖNORM, it is to be treated as a replacement of the word, so it goes behind the number and with spaces: 1,55 €
the American way ($1
55) would be incorrect, because you also wouldn't write "Dollar1
55". it is permissible in tables and such, where you're not writing a full sentence and trying to get everything evenly placed, but personally even there I'd prefer to write it with a space (€ 1,55)
Don´t think so
For the correct ' I have to hit shift-# and for the ´ I only have to hit the key next to the backspace
But I guess mainly it´s about being used to it
this and that all the names of functions change, ugh
still can never remember SVERWEIS, think it's SLOOKUP
From a mathematical point of view
Why
10^9 works for both - milliard and billion
Maths doesn't care what you call 10^9, it doesn't change based on what you call it
If you continue that train of thought, it wouldn't make sense to call 10^3 ten hundred either
Either you have specific (in the sense of the short scale) words for each 10^x or you don't. Both are fine, it just depends on what you're used to and if you communicate in another language, it should be clear what you mean, but both work
so the long system, but without separate names for the "thousands of". interesting
also the direction changes, while in English it's 66-99, in German it's 99-66 (that's how it should be, ultimately depends on the font though)
**„example“**
According to the wiki article, specifically the british and the french
Most of us just used what the french were already using
»Guillemets« are an acceptable middle ground
That's an excellent point I hadn't even considered
Thanks for pointing it out
ok I think I want it to be written like 1•000•000„65 now
actually, quotation marks are always quotation marks, and the ones used to just quote are also the ones used to *ironically* quote something
above-above is just an English/internet/keyboard convention, and doesn't have to do anything with the meaning
I think you're just too lose to France ;)
we write them like »this«, not like « this »
only used in literary works though
I guess it depends if you are in a bigger city or in the rural areas
Nobody really cares about it
> I haven't entered a church since I was in lower school :/
Same for me until a wedding some years ago
I was shocked by how brainwashed people react and that I still knew all those things you are supposed to say because it was drilled into our brains at very young age
No one would allow this if it would be a new thing instead of "part of our culture"
Not in the balkans
Beeing orthodox, catholic or muslim is often synonymous for beeing serb, croat or bosniak
Especially for the generation that lived through the civil wars in the 90s.
You can‘t be catholic AND a serb, according to, well every serb, croat, etc
I ever talked to
During communist times people didn‘t really bother with religion, but many kept their religious customs anyways because the Yugoslav government wasn‘t so hard crushing on religion as the eastern block (remember, Yugoslavia was not under the „control“ of the Soviet Union - the army was always prepared for an invasion, be it from the west or the east)
PS: I‘m a serb myself
I don‘t believe in god but I don‘t really care too much about it, and I‘m probably not going to tell my parents that
Why
Well it‘s none of their business and they don‘t bother me with religious stuff anyway
I live in Austria and people generally don‘t care what you believe in
He has big ears, and we often make fun of them
People sometimes joke about Sebastian Kurz because of the cult of personality surrounding him
He and the other ministers communicate very elusively, it's like trying to put a nail in Jello
During the government crisis in May people joked that our president's true love is our Constitution because he couldn't stop praising it's "elegance".
He has giant ears, and, since he is so young, there's often jokes along the line of him still being a student
['member this nice poem
Don't forget the world famous Basti-haircut and the fact that he is actually just 8 years old
[Look how cute he is with his ears
That and hes already twice divorced
I think he looks very gnomy
Private Kyle
Interesting question
In high German I pronounce it with an s, but in my German dialect it's sh, like all s.
Hebrew for sure, absolutely fascinating language
Then probably italian so i could finally take my mum on the trip around rural italy shes always wanted to go on
And i think either arab or maori, also just because i like the languages
I am already learning Italian, but only for about a year and on duolingo, so this kind of counts as my first pick already
Italian is such a beautiful language
Next is Croatian
I know a few Croatians who it'd be cool to impress, also I could finally understand all the serbian dialogue in Vienna (it's not thaaat much, but you hear it from time to time)
Well I guess if I'm already at it, Spanish would be cool too
Sounds great just like Italian and I could watch some films/series without subtitles
Japanese, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese (currently studying)
I'm already pretty fluent in english, german and slovenian are my native tongues, so russian (also currently studying) is relatively easy so far
>Spanish because it can be useful in the world
Also in the worst case you can just pack your things and make camp in the 17th bundesland
> after English and Greek haha
You don't speak English and Greek
Yeah, but that's also kind of cheating
As far as I know sz=š, cz=c(with hacek), rz=r(with hacek) and something is probavly z(with hacek)
Holy crap, I didn't know my keyboard has so few haceks
Edit: Typo
Oh yeah, right ;)
We have to keep and maintaining them according to our state treaty
Most of them are memorials on soldiers grave yards, [like this one near me] it's kinda OK
The one big famous is the memorial on the Schwarzenberg Plaza, always confusing tourists which didn't know Austria was for 10 years occupied after the 2nd WW
We do though
We have memorial stones for the fallen soldiers in WW2 in almost every village for example
Because these were still people, these were someone's brother, father, friend
Even though they fought for the Nazis
So we should *not* celebrate the people who fought all the way down to Vienna to rid Europe of the Nazis
Defeating Nazis was a good deed
Done by brothers, fathers, uncles, neighbours, friends of someone
People
More a café thing, but also applies in bars
Please specify right away which coffee you'd like
If you're not sure, ask right away
Same thing in Austria :( We've got Wirtshäuser, but only old men go there to drink, young people only go there for meals with their parents
Completely different from pub culture
We have got bars, but they're expensive and they play loud music
At least here, the table has a special ashtray with a [Stammtisch sign] Dunno what they're going to do now that smoking is banned
oh, I tought that's how it's supposed to taste like
Since the first of November
Not in this context
More like „the usual table“.
Which is why you move the glass to a more vertical angle once you get towards the end
Perfect crowns every time
All police are armed with handguns in Austria so it's very common to see them
I guess I'm used to it because it's always been this way so it doesn't make me feel scared
Better we don't tell OP that most police cars and stations contain assault rifles too \^\^
Just that they usually stay there, without being used / carried around
Some statistics, why we don't need to be scared:
2012-2018: 37 shots were fired at people
6 people were killed, 13 wounded
The average is about 60 shots per year, most of them warning shots or to scare away animals
Austrian police is commonly equipped with Glock 17 hand guns, indeed they have Steyr Aug A3 Subcompacts and bulletproof vests in their cars and or stations but they don’t commonly carry them
I only saw them at Vienna’s Airport or on duty when protecting embassies
A large portion of Austrian police have assault rifles in the car
But they don't carry them around unless something big happened
I've seen them once when a bankrobbery was going on in town
Well at the moment there are polices officers with assault rifles in public places like train stations
That's because we probably still are in a higher terror alert state
A lot of civilians dont know the difference
Not surprising when the news reports about "fully semi automatic" weapons
There are slings for them
Exactly
Christmas 4 years ago were the attacks on the Christmas market in Germany
Thats what I meant with "something big happened".
They usually don't carry their AUGs unless the interior ministry says there is a real threat
>I don't think it's assault rifles, it's smg's.
They are definitely assault rifles
They have the Steyr AUG A3 in 5,56×45 NATO
They used to have the AUG A1 and a 9mm version of the AUG
EKO Cobra (basically SWAT) have the AUG A3 in .300 Blackout
Europe (There's the discussion regarding Eurasia in some school books
North America
South America
Africa
Asia
Australia (Sometimes, very rarely, Oceania)
Antarctica
Two Americas
Australia is a continent, New Zealand is not part of it
UK, Japan, New Zealand etc
are just not part of any continent (and in the end, "continent" is just an arbitrary human name for "huge island", in a way
Again with exceptions like Greenland)
(Ofc often names refer to vague regions, like Japan is part of Asia
But not part of the continent)
Seven continents:
•North America
•South America
•Africa
•Asia
•Antarctica
•Oceania (although many people just call it Australia which always bugged me)
•Europe
Säd america is sad
Continents are kind of arbitrary in definition
If for example you separated by tectonic plates, Eurasia would be one but India is a separate one
The question wasn't what Google says, it was what your school said
&#x200B;
I think we have established that different people have different opinions on what is a continent, and that's fine
In Vienna it has improved a lot in the last 10-15 years
Still not great but much better
Dunno about the rest of the country
Not so good
Other than all our neighbors we prohibit cycling in the forest
outside of cities it's really quite poor
and you're not allowed in the forests either (unless explicitely allowed, which in 99% of the places it isn't)
The only areas where it's slightly better is where we get a lot of tourism, but the recreational cycling infrastructure is a bit different from one that would benefit commuting
So yeah, we've got a lot to do, but I'm crossing fingers that we get a less right-wing and more progressive government sometime, that will help with that, among other things
I live in the Wachau and there are lots of bike routes for getting around without having to drive on car streets
I don‘t think we have family gatherings
At least I’ve barely ever heard of family gatherings (I thought it was an american thing
) and my family doesn‘t really have contact with my aunts and uncles, since my mom is polish (and none of us, except my mom, can speak polish) and my one aunt on my dads side who lives in Austria lives in a different federal state had a big argument with my dad so now they stopped talking
Is it because your clan holds some secret recipe or something
I always love this:
Wenn Fliegen über Fliegen fliegen fliegen Fliegen Fliegen nach
Word by word: If flys over flys fly fly flys flys after
Literally: If flys fly over flys, flys fly after flys
With the same word 5 times in a row it still makes perfekt sense, and shows how important capitalisation is in German
> Ich bin auf Urlaub nach Italien, das Land der Römer, wo die Sonne scheint und die Zitronen blühen, gefahren
"For my vacation I have to Italy, the country of Romans where the sun is shining and the lemons bloom gone
I made that sentence up
The point is that in German verb forms like "have gone" can be split apart by any number of  dependent clauses
There's other, more reasonable ways to say things,  but the above is a perfectly legal and legible German sentence
Even Mark Twain made fun of it in a hilarious essay
**EDIT:** Alright, I added the comma, hot damn
Stop reminding me
When I miss a comma in German just use one of those I put too much in English, there's plenty to choose from
There is nothing I can say about German that Mark Twain hasn't already said and better in his [*The awful German language*]
Wenn Fliegen hinter Fliegen fliegen, fliegen Fliegen Fliegen nach
In german (and many other languages), when you combine nouns, you lose the space in between
So Obst+Schale (fruit+bowl) makes Obstschale (fruit bowl)
Now what makes this fun is actually adding more than two nouns
You can do as many as you want
My personal favourite from recent history would be the Bundespräsidentenstichwahlwiederholungsverschiebung
(postponement of the redial of the run-off for the federal president)
"umfahren" is the opposite of "umfahren"
Edit: in Austria, "ausrasten" means to relax, in Germany, "ausrasten" means to loose your shit over something
Same in Austria and it makes perfect sense, although there are some people from the country side who don't seem to get the 8:15 part or 8:45 while they use the 8:30 part as "half nine".
Yeah no one would use it
In that sentence there are a lot of pieces you can abbreviate very easily
Instead of saying
>.. eine Kurve, die scharf war, ...
(a turn which was sharp)
you can simply say
>eine scharfe Kurve
(a sharp turn)
You can also rearrange the different parts of the sentence so it's less interleaved
So instead of
>Er sagte, nachdem er das Haus, welches in der Straße, die eine Kurve, die scharf war, hatte, stand, sah, "oh".
you could say
> Er sagte "oh" nachdem er das Haus sah, das in einer Strasse mit einer scharfen Kurve stand
>proper German you'd say "in Urlaub"
Austrian standard German is proper German
Its our standard German and grammatically correct
They are not reversed
"Half nine" means we are half the way through the ninth hour
"Quarter Nine" means we are a quarter through the ninth hour and "three quarter nine" means we are 3 quarters through the ninth hour
Try to read a German textbook on a complicated matter
I am in engineering and professors often tell us to get American literature, because many German professors just want to show off how intelligent they are and how long they can go on with a single sentence
I mean some people in Austria actually say "quarter before" and "quarter after" but yeah, I get where you are coming from, but still "quarter to nine" can also be understood that we are a quarter hour along on the way to nine
No one in Austria would understand "three quarters nine" as 8:15 and the confusion usually is only with "quarter 9" and some people see that as 9:15 or "viertel ueber (Neun)".
General history:
* Habsburg family
* -> Maria Theresia
* -> Franz Ferdinand
* -> Marie Antoinette
* Peter Rosegger (Poet, Author)
* Engelbert Dollfuß (dictator in Austria while Hitler was dictator in Germany)
Music:
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
* Johann Strauß & Johann Strauß Sohn (father & son)
* Franz Joseph Haydn
Psychology:
* Sigmund Freud (even though born in Czechia, he grew up in Austria
Not particularly history but still pretty known:
* Arnold Schwarzenegger (38th governor of California, former bodybuilder, actor, producer, businessman)
* Dietrich Mateschitz (Founder of Red Bull, richest Austrian)
* Daniel Svarowski (Name pretty unknown but the brand Svarowski is quite known)
There are also personalities like **Friedrich Hundertwasser** many people have heard of but by far not everyone
(Also they may be regional)
There are also people like **Sissi/Elisabeth** whom I didn‘t include because even though she reigned Austria and is Austrian in everyones heads, even has „von Österreich“ (from Austria) in her name she was born in Bavaria
(Honestly I just wasn‘t sure if I should include her or not, so I just wrote down her name here
I tried listing as many known names as possible, I may have missed some but I do think I got the top of the top
Maria Theresia
Maximilian, The last Knight
Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico
Sigmund Freud
Alfred Adler
Mozart
Gustav Klimt
Franz Schubert
Haydn
We did it
The Germans finally claim Hitler to be their citizen
Rosegger is someone whom IMO the younger generations of Austrians have never heard of
The problem that any attempt of listing well-known people will run into is that people who arent interested in politics and history do exist
And teenagers don't have much knowledge yet
Maria Theresia and Franz Joseph are probably the "big ones" when it comes to rulers
May as well include Hitler since he used to be an Austrian before denouncing it
Post-WW2 Kreisky is probably the only politician that everyone knows
I would list Thomas Brezina as an example of someone who is well known to young people, but also known to exist to older folk
And, for eccentric reasons, Richard Lugner
Next to Schwarzenegger is probably Christoph Waltz (not as iconic though)
Some sports people probably as well, like Dominic Thiem, or Niki Lauda
Though athletes tend to fall out of public consciousness after a while
Same thing with musicians: Andreas Gabalier is well known right now, and Falco and Udo Jürgens are still well known - but they will probably be forgotten in a few decades
Maybe General Radetzky too
Beethoven
I feel like the vast majority has heard his name or at least a scrap of one of his symphony‘s names
(Not sure if he‘s as known because well, everyone around here knows Mozart and knowing his biggest enemy is kinda - well - a given too)
As for Rosegger: I‘m 16
He‘s well known
For what is kinda unknown, but his name, along with often his birth place, Krieglach, is known
Idk if you meant people younger than me, but he is known
I‘ve heard of Thomas Brenzina once in my life, and that‘s because my german friends talked about him
I‘ve never heard his name before and would‘ve probably gone on never knowing his name up until this point
I think I included the „some are regional“ specifically because of Rosegger
I‘m Styrian
Also I doubt Mozart will fall out of history just like that in the next decades
Ah, yeah the regional nothing could also be true about Brezina, probably more well known in Vienna
And regarding musicians, obviously I didnt mean Mozart :P
I don't think Brezina is regional to Vienna
But I think it's more of a generational gap
I for example grew up with Tom Turbo and the Knickerbocker Bande and I live in Tyrol
Well we never know, maybe I‘m wrong and Mozart will be forgotten by tomorrow :‘)
Weird flex but ok
I think our equivalent are german tourists getting killed by cows
Absolutely
Standard MO: They enter a enclosure with a dog on a leash, come close to a Mother who has calved
The Mother charges at the dog, tourist refuses to let him go (which she should absolutely do, a dog can easily evade a cow)
The Bereaved sue the farmer
It happens a lot
I'm only able to speak it fairly well, because when I was 12 I really wanted to play Yu-Gi-Oh and all the cards were only available in English
Similarly, I wanted to read the newest Harry Potter books as soon as they were released, so I at the very least had to be able to at least read English reasonably well
Nowadays I do not care whether I speak German or English, but depending on the context I might just be more expressive in English than I would be speaking German
I don't like English
The pronounciation and spelling is pure chaos
The sound of the language is ok
Not bad or good
I also hate people who use English words in German
But that is just my opinion, please don't take it personal
I like my dialect a lot more than standard German and I like German more than English
Can't say I'm a fan
English is imprecise compared to German and feels constricting
On top of that pronunciation and spelling are nothing less than a mess
I use it only if i have to i.e. work and internet things
Otherwise i try to avoid it whenever i can, i think it is a quite ugly language
I agree with the point that it's not very precise
Technical instructions for example or law texts are so much better in German for example
Gee, it's almost if it's a German brand name (based on a French (?) name) and is actually pronounced differently
That is one good analogy
I speak an austro-bavarian dialect, but I like every dialect more than standard German
The only problem is understanding the dialects, but for me every one has something special in it that standard German is lacking
I understand that standard German is necessary for communication, the same for English
We had already 2 month of school before summer holidays, was not really a problem
More worrisome is they have no details nor any measurements planed, especially when the flu and common cold season is here again I guess there will be panic reaction from our politicians
Personally I feel quite safe
Going to school with a bunch of 15/16 year olds is really nice, because they understand the situation and comply
Also, I don‘t have any people that are at risk in my family ~~andmydadtoldmehewouldn‘tcareifIdiedbecauseofthevirusbecauseIwould‘vediedanywaysoIdon‘tcareeither~~
I’m a student, my school’s organization for the lockdown as well as the months after was horrible
While kids my age are usually civilized enough for the corona crisis, some of the teachers were a big problem
It’s just horrible to see how issues at school are barely ever treated as real issues just because they don’t cost money
If anything the "solution" is to give the schools even less money than they already get and definitely less than they need and deserve
"Austrians are like [Punschkrapferl] Red at the outside, brown at the inside and always a little drunk
" - Allegedly Thomas Bernhard
"Well, we must recognise that he was not member of the SA, but only his horse
\- Fred Sinowatz's sarcastic remark when it came to light that the former Secretary-General of the United Nations Waldheim was member of the SA (Sturmabwehr; a predecessor to the Nazi SS) and when he was confronted with an [Old Foto] where Waldheim was in SA uniform sitting on a horse and still told people that he wasn't part of the organization
There's also a saying comparing former Nazis who joined the SPÖ (social democratic party) after WWII to Punschkrapferl: “red on the outside, brown on the inside”
Blühende Landschaften voller brauner Blumen more like it
The East has gotten a raw deal because of a boggled reconstruction policy and Germany reaps the rewards for chances not taken today -_-
Here in Austria, we have quite a noteworthy Romanian community (around 80000)
I feel like Romania is generally viewed as a more impoverished country and often associated with gypsies and cheap labor (lots of workers come here)
Both places also share some history, since Romania was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
Despite these prejudices, Romania is a truly gorgeous country
I'd love to visit Sibiu one day
The first thing people would think of are "gypsies", and most of the beggars around here are assumed to be of such origin
So not very good
I visited Romania twice so far, and I was positively overwhelmed each time
Such a beautiful country with a plethora of culture to experience
I met so many nice and welcoming people there
It is sad that although geographically we aren't that far apart the common image about Romania is so wrong
Whenever Romania comes up in a conversation, people also believe it is highly unsafe to go there
I do my best to prove them wrong by telling them about my travels :)
One thing though, your rail network is in dire need of improvements
Source of a steady flow of medical doctors, business(wo)men and beggars that come to Austria
Romanians do the jobs Austrians dont want to
From prostitute to elderly care to farmwork
Thats Austria

Doch
Ist das so
My little village has a castle from first mentioned in the 13th century
In the beginning of18th century it was bought by a (then noble) family which overhauled it in baroque style and lives in it still now
The son of the current owner does ongoing Renovations currently
Graz has many but the most popular should be its clock tower
It has its current style since 1560 and was part of a bigger castle and fortress
But the French sieged it during the 5rh coalition war until the ceasefire of Znaim happened and the fortress has to be given up
It was planned to raze tthe whole fortress with the clock tower, but the people of Graz paid a ransom/bribe that the tower would be left alone
For Salzburg it's definitely the Hohensalzburg Fortress overlooking the city
Stephen's cathedral, Schönbrunn castle, and some more
I'd say the whole barrio del Carmen as well
In dialect there is Schlägl, whichs could be translated to "punchy"
~~The Hammer of a Miner is called "Bergeisen" which literrally translates to "Mountain Iron"``~~
Edit: i got confused, the Bergeisen ist the chisel, Afaik it's the hammer is also called Schlägl/Schlegl
Hammer in German is just Hammer, pronounced somewhat hard
In my Austrian dialect (west Austria) it’s something like „huma“ which is also quite soft
So I guess it’s not German or Austrian dialect
Don't forget about "Fäustel" which somewhat derives from 'fist ' but it sounds close to its diminutive
Austrian German prefers the diminutive
How is „szajs“ - pronounced ? Cause in Vienna we have „schas“ - which means „fart“ or something is shitty
Ah ok - yeah Schas doesn’t have the ei sound
I am 26 and living in Vienna
I am able to save about 400€ a month but I have a lot of hobbys and I‘m not really frugal
I would say in theory with a bit of a smaller apartment and more frugal lifestyle, 1k would be possible
Would love to be 25 again, so this is educated guesswork for the Austrian situation in one of the four larger cities and Vienna
So this goes for someone with a masters degree in a field with higher pay fresh from university
Wage: 3
000 before taxes so around 2
100 EUR after taxes and an additional christmas and holiday gratification of 4
800 EUR ( Austrians get 14 payments a year with a tax discount on the 13th/14th wage)
A municipal flat or condo flat will cost you about 500 to 800 EUR
A privatly rented one about 1
000 EUR
Costs of living tend to be high for food, cheap for public transportation
So I'd guess that you might save around 300 a month if you live cheaply or might just scrape by in Vienna if you are not eligible for a subsidized flat
In western cities Salzburg and Innsbruck it is worse and might need your 13th and 14th wage to come by
I'm 26 and I got my whole apartment and car stuff covered easily, but on top of that I'm saving next to nothing
I did when I was younger but now I can't be bothered anymore and I just *live* instead
Can't really say anything about after university degree, but 10 years ago when I started working immediately after having finished high school, I still lived at home and commuted to the city
Monthly expenses were for the train, food, and chipping in at home with costs for the household, I earned ~1300€+200€ bonus and paid about 500€, so I could save ~1000€ per month
That is 80% of the Western world
Weapons grade consumerism
People buy fucking couches and TVs on loans
It's mind boggling
IIRC Slovenia's economy is among the fastest growing economies in the EU
And they really deserve it
I was earning in Romania around 1300 after taxes while studying for my master degree
Both were full time
As a person with a technical degree from Uni (which is what OP seems to be asking), saving 400€ per month is not much
Definitely this
I make around 1900-2000€ and I'm studying on the side, so that's technically without a degree
Yeah
mylah91 said:
>Some could save a lot, but they spend everything
And I said it's even worse, many even spend money they don't have
Well ofc it depends on the lifestyle, but if you are single & live in a small apartment and have 1 or 2 average hobbies, saving 1000€ per month is pretty standard I'd say
E.g. earn 2300€ net - 700€ rent, 300€ food, 300€ hobbies
Owning a car however means saving a lot less of course
> Already above standard for Austria
as I stated above, I am talking with a technical degree from Uni
> Mostly not a choice either in Austria
What do you mean
That you need a car
If you live in the countryside, yes, but a lot of people (most people
) live in cities, where you can use public transport and bicycles
And no, I am not Viennese
Viennas public transport system is the best, but you can get by with it fine in a lot of cities
And if you are trying to make a point about the Netherlands being better for bicycles, you are right, but again, you can get by fine with a bicycle in a lot of Austrian cities, and in fact, most uni students do
Vienna would actually become bearable
Well, wouldnt be much change in our case
Apart from Vienna being quite empty and Graz would face some serious issues
Austria would stop hating the north and start hating the south
And it would become more nationalistic since now there are those anoying "northerners" on the border
Yeah, suddenly all of austria would hate graz instead
Replacing Viennese with Carinthians would NOT be an Improvement
> riots in supermarkets
Just imagine all the chaos in Aldi
I mean austrians would finally own a beach again
Less friendly nepotism, more blatant corruption
true
Denmark is just Switzerland but from a bizarro parallel universe
Mountain kraut, lol
> it's just that they were young and fearless
It's mostly the 24 hour news coverage
Its not exclusive to Italy, its happening world wide
Its much safer now pretty much everywhere in the Western world than it was in the last 50 years
But nowadays every single rape, robbery and murder gets put on the news and it makes us feel less safe
Yes, same here
I actually like them a bit softer than al dente - but you have to have good quality pasta so it is not mushy (but I know you wrote you like it that way)
When our son just started eating we bought Barilla on purpose because that stuff gets very mushy
Fun fact: Many Austrians believe that good quality pasta contains egg and bad quality pasta does not
Yes
Jtsigx igciz kg igcizit If kg kgigufugjf ich If kg oh kg it t auto moderator dumb
quick question: spaghetti, break them once in the middle or leave them long
might have to add, I learned it from an Italian
As a chef this also bothers me as rule number one when boiling is always to wait until its really boiling
Edit: before I get shit about the inaccuracy of my post to clarify: number one rule when you don't want the taste to go too much into the water
al mascellare
*scribbling down notes*
thankfully our selection of Italian products is really not that bad; what a great country to have as a neighbor
It is because of marketing
There is this brand of egg containing pasta that really pushed this agenda and a lot of people really believe now that this brand is superior because of eggs
Why the hell would you not salt it
Somewhere in between
What I would do is try it with medium bubbles and look at the result and then adjust the time from the same point that you used for your first measurement
So for myself i know that my eggs need 4min10 to be exactly the way I like them from the point where they cook like the way they did when I first made them
Also for eggs you never really want the water to go absolutely crazy as it might crack the eggs
We partly have German television and it's kinda interesting to see the differences and what's basically a copy of the German version
*ahem* Dancing Stars *ahem*
Well why do you not just dig a hole then
I only know of them from US tv shows and movies
Wouldn't make much sense in German, for the same reason most people here already stated
If you hear a German word, you usually know how to write it
There are some inconsistencies, but no huge surprises
It's called 'Buchstabierwettbewerb' in German, and I think it would make much sense with either long composite words or loan words which don't adhere to german spelling rules
There are plenty of either
The President is a popular vote, If No canditate gets over 50% there is another election Just between the two strongest canditate
The chancelor isn't directly voted, the Parties who Form the government after the General election decide who will be chancelor
Usually it's the Party Leader of the strongest Party, but it doesn't have to be
Depends on who you say our leader is
The chancellor of course is the head of government
He is elected trough the parliamentary elections
In that election you vote for a party, and the candidate of that party (usually the head of the party) will become chancellor in case of victory AND if the president instructs him to form a government (which of course usually happens)
But theoretically if the winner of the elections fails to form a coalition to get over 50% the president could instruct e.g. party number two to form a government
If the party succeeds it could happen that the top party is not in the government and the head of party number two will become chancellor
But if something like this happened, it would rather come to new elections, although it happened in 2000 when the negotiations to form a coalition lead by the top party at the time failed and party number two and three formed a coalition and the head of party number three became chancellor
The president, however, is directly elected
To be elected president you need to have the simple majority, so at least 50,1%. In the last election we had 5 (I believe) candidates so we had a first round of voting in which no candidate got the 50,1% so it got into another election where the top two candidates from the first election were against each other so one had to get the simple majority
Sooo something like [that
I really envy our neighbors for their democracy
I don't think our system in Austria is bad, but far less democratic
I really like our dual-leadership system
The government crisis after the Ibiza-Affair showed quite well why having a president besides the government is important
It's always better to split power so that both bodies can control each other
Actually the president alone decides upon the chancellor and ministers
In practice they can be removed by the parliament, so typically a majority in the parliament "strongly suggests" to the president who should be in which position who usually just takes that list and chooses them
>The chancelor isn't directly voted
Just adding that the chancellor is appointed by the president
The President basically can pick any Citizen over 16 to be Chancellor
I have no idea how society views that
I can't say that I myself experienced much pressure from my family but then again I disappointed most expectations they had towards me, so it might just be them giving up
**Vorarlberg**: Weird Swiss people, basically disconnected from the rest of the country
Linguists still aren't sure what kind of language they use
**Tyrol**: Nationalist mountain people who only care about themselves and some weird tiny Italian province
Can't pronounce anything besides kchchchchch
**Carinthia**: Nazis
**Salzburg**: Bavarians
**Upper Austria**: Bavarian Nazis, but on Crystal Meth
**Styria**: Pumkin-seed oil addicted people who think Graz is a city
Their dialect sounds like barking
**Burgenland**: Some incredibly flat third world dystopia
Not much to do there besides drinking wine, being a Nazi or swimming in some muddy lake
**Lower Austria**: Has been a dictatorship for the last 27 years (God Emperor Pröll first and now his proxy Hanni, the mother of a few of his children)
Probably the most generic part of Austria
The guys with basement kids
**Vienna**: Stuck up and arrogant pricks who can't drive and think of the rest of the country as some backwards hellhole
I, a citizen of Vienna, can only endorse the stuff about Vienna
I can confirm
I am a Viennese, can't drive and think that the rest of the country is backwards hellhole
But the rest of the country IS a backwards hellhole xD
It should also be noted that half of the states had only governors from one party since people voting in Austria was a thing
I mean Vienna is a backwards hellhole as well after all :p
Are you stuck up and arrogant
Do you live in 1942
(even though I don't consider Alto Adigians to be Austrians either for that matter)
Ask the backwards hellhole
Vorarlberg, the Tyrol and Upper Austria have been black since the 1870s.
Vienna had CS/VF governors
That's true
Most of us are friendly as fuck
Considering our current politics I wouldn't consider us civilized in any sense, but alright
Good Point my dear third world fascist <3
>I mean why can't you just see Germany as the older brother
Austria is older than Germany :p
>as far as I know most Germans have no problem with Austrians
It's more like they never think about us because Austria is utterly irrelevant to most Germans
And while I don't hate Germans or Germany (pretty much the opposite actually) I don't see a reason why we should work more closely together just for the sake of speaking the same language
Both of our countries are part of the EU already, that's enough
The CS/VF was there to indicate that its basically the same party
I mean it's not like we are any better lmao
>With older brother I meant that Germany is bigger and it's economy is superior than Austria's.
Call them our bigger step-cousin and we are down ;D
>other German people apparat from Austrians and Piefkes as well ;)
All Germans are Prussians
Spoke with my southern tyrolean neighbor
People bad at geography in Italy just consider everything north non-italian speaking German
Doesnt matter if its the Swiss, Austrians or the Germans
I'd choose Czechia tbh
We already work really closely with Germany anyway
I like to go shopping in Germany
It's so close, I can even drive over the border with my bike
Totally normal
In western Austria there is that one region called „Deutsches Egg“ (German Corner)
It’s a part of Germany where you travel through if you go from the state of Tyrol to the state of Salzburg
Many people do it daily as they live in Tyrol but live in Salzburg (or vice versa)
I’m also quite fond of street cycling and when I’m on a long tour (say 200km) I always end up in Germany
I honestly love it
It’s great to hop in your car and just drive and be in another country
It’s also great for school trips
With my high school I went to Switzerland, Germany, Italy (Rome), France (Paris), London and Latvia
It’s great honestly
as to your last question, not necessarily
next capital (bratislava) is about an hour by car, or an afternoon trip by bike away
offers great food, cheaper prices, nice outdoor areas to explore, all in a completely different country and language
and in my whole life, I've been exactly once
I guess when things are that close it's just normal and not specifically travel-worthy
or maybe it's because we're reluctant to travel long distances
saw my grandparents only once a year during summer holidays because they lived "far away", far away in this case meaning you'd be in the car for 2
5 hours
I guess many people just tend to stay in the area they live in, because nobody likes to spend a lot of time in a car
We need a translator (or several) without leaving the country
>I can get on a plane in Atlanta and fly for 6 hours to Seattle, and when I get off the plane everything is more or less the same
Same language with the same accent, same restaurants and cafes, same shops, same street signs and general layout - it’s pretty crazy imo
I can drive 2 hours, stay in my state and won't understand the people there
Dialects that formed over hundreds of years in the mountains are crazy man
wow, really puts it in perspective
I live in the country's capital, and could take an afternoon bike trip to be in another capital altogether: different country, different language, etc
still I hardly ever go, guess what you can easily have is never that special, haha
Europe is pretty much the opposite, at least within the Schengen agreement countries
There are no border checks, you drive down the road, come across a sign "welcome to (country)" and you're suddenly in a country with a different culture, language and the road signs look kinda weird
Dude, no offense, but in some areas of your eastern parts
"If you are an EU national, you do not need to show your national ID card or passport when you are travelling from one border-free Schengen EU country to another
Even if you don't need a passport for border checks within the Schengen area , it is still always highly recommended to take a passport or ID card with you, so you can prove your identity if needed (if stopped by police, boarding a plane, etc
Schengen EU countries have the possibility of adopting national rules obliging you to hold or carry papers and documents when you are present on their territory
Driving licences, post, bank or tax cards are not accepted as valid travel documents or proof of identity
([source]
Those are incredibly common in Austria as well
I've one too, I love the Coffee from it and could simply Put in the wood stove If it's currently burning
I prefer the heat from these to the central heating
I do agree that the central heating is easier in your own house
If you a in a house with multiple flats, it gets more complicated
We've socket protectors as well
The [old ones] are glued into the socket and you have to twist the plug 90° to be able to plug it into the socket
The [new version] is prebuilt into the socket
My Austrian grandmother had a bidet, and apparently it was quite modern when she installed it somewhen in the 60s. At some point it fell out of fashion and I don't know any lately built house to have one
It gains a little bit more publicity as a zero waste alternative nowadays
One issue with my grandmothers bidet might have been, that it was a seperat thing
So you would have to wiggle with you pants down and your bare butt exposed across the bathroom (toilet and bidet still in the same room next to each other of course)
I never used it, because no one explained how to use it and I wasn't eager to try it out as a kid
It is fascinating that in Italy it is now mandatory to have one installed
You have to push both pins in at the same time for it to open
There's some plastic blocking the entry and push down by a spring
I tried forcing one open with a screwdriver (the one to check for electricity) and couldn't do that
But plugs work easily
Teabags are very, very common
The one thing we don't get around here are circular teabags, and those huge 100 bag boxes
Sounds like a Swedish answer, haha
Jk, I think we would just use sponges or brushes to clean the sink
Also reusable
edit; I guess it's not to clean the sink
Not really
Most just have two holes
I can recommend GommeHD
net and Rewinside
tv (Hypixel-Like), play
timolia
de (JnRs and straight PvP mainly), uwmc
de and nocoords
com (survival), NeruxVace
net (hardcore Bedwars)
It is
150-200 ping here in Upperaustria
Maybe it's me, but I can't stand the lag
Additionally Hypixel is sometimes somewhat buggy, wich is why i stopped playing anything but Skyblock
Proper building regulations to tackle land consumption
We have horrible [suburban sprawl] where you can't be in nature without seeing a building (except mountains and north eastern Austria)
After Corona: wearing face masks like the japanese when you are sick
To show you respect other peoples health
I work as a receptionist and I am so done being coughed at and getting sick because desinfectting your hands after shaking them is/was frowned upon
I'd like to see a Vulcano in Austria, like
Etna or Fuji-san
I do miss a lot of reptiles here
You cannot get some snakes like western hognoses (I know of exactly one breeding pair in the country) or garter snakes here, but they are super common in the US
The same with milk snakes and BCIs but they are occasionally on sale(maybe once a year)
You can get reticulated pythons, burmese pythons, Green tree pythons and most tarantulas (even exotic ones like a P. striata) instantly
We also cannot get reptiles shipped
You need a licensed company(there are close to none), you need to inform the state administration, city administration and veterinary Department and the city districts administration
It is basically impossible unless you own a pet shop
I realised how fucked up your system is when German politicans and expert started to praise our system
Sorry for the German Youtube video, but I need to plug this because it's just so important
It's a clip from a German satirical show that shows how the insurance lobby persuaded German politics that private insurance is "much more efficient" than one single governmental insurance: [Die Anstalt - Versicherungslobby vs
gesetzliche Rente]
Austria's insurance lobby is trying really hard to go down the same route as well and that scares me
A lot
Agree
I don't think I've ever met any other Austrian who was even aware of this issue
It funny because the opposite is true in the west (in the mountains)
There just isn‘t enough available land that housing is allowed to be built on, yet there is a ton of open farmland/pastures
I wish the rules were more open that farmers could more easily sell parts of there land to build housing
>water fountains with sparkling water
This is the real unpopular opinion here
Like, what
At a certain point something has to give
A square meter of buildable ground is going for at least €700 (upwards of €1000 in the right location)
And I don‘t even live in a city
Housing prices have gone through the roof and it has become extremely difficult for a normal family with kids to afford housing
Even renting an apartment is crazy expensive
Austria doesn't have a mandatory insurance system like the other countries you listed
Germany has a "Versicherungspflicht", but Austria has a "Pflichtversicherung". Depending on where you are employed, you are automatically insured with a certain state owned insurance body
For some dumb reason, we just have a bunch of those and not one single insurance body for everyone
The house I live in was built in the 1880s ... and it's just a regular house of many, nothing super special
Living here (Vienna, in my case) is great, I don't see any problems because the city is "old". Infrastructure works really well and is looked after regularly
That's what happens when you have a socialist city council ;)
One of the biggest problems city developers face is how they have to build around ancient ruins when they want to build new stuff, especially in the center
But I hear this is much worse in Rome
Traffic Planing and Management usually sucks, the city centers are not made for Car Traffic
even in old cities there's newly built up areas and new buildings, but if you buy or rent an apartment in one of the old buildings (typically from the 1800s), you normally know what you're getting: possibly hard to heat and shoddy plumbing/heating system/windows installed, unless it's been completely renovated
parking space probably not included
often not wheelchair accessible, and no elevators
the stairs right behind the entrance make lugging up your bike each day to put it out in the back yard cumbersome
depending on your situation, the advantages can make up for it: nice wide doors and high rooms, central location, historic and nicely designed entrance and staircase
city-wide there's difficulties for traffic, parking space, and I guess also things like building sewage systems and subways, high maintenance cost of cobblestone roads, but these are things that you'd normally not really notice as a normal citizen (only indirectly through longer time for construction projects etc)
many of those "problems" suddenly become no problem at all if you're willing to get cars out of the city and return them to what they're intended for, pedestrian- (and bike-)friendly spaces
It creates some limits to public planning
You can't route modern traffic through medieval town centers as there might not be enough space
Creates bottlenecks on the one hand but also is more pedestrian friendly as at least the town centers are compact, naturally designed to have walkable distances
Though that clashes with modern suburbia
Apart from that having old buildings around creates a great atmosphere and sense of community
We have an old church around here that dates to the 960ties, the space around it has been the meeting place for young people for decades
Have a beer, view over the whole region, great place
Then there is a medieval castle thats a great place to take a hour long walk to
Only if you are reporting it
I guess the only time you would hear this argument is during the election for president (head of state)
Because during this election, the two people who get the most votes, face each other in a final election
We have one political party most people hate
Die Grünen (the green ones), because they‘re known for not doing the shit their party is supposed to do/stand up for
They‘re kind of in the rise right now, but even so, people really don‘t care
Well that is the effect modern media logic has had on politics
Politics is condensed to a they vs
us logic, parties are condensed to their respective leaders, the actual political movement gets sidelined
And parties have embraced this as it is much easier to sell a nice looking charismatic guy or gal than a political program
And hell do party leaders love it to be the pinacle of attention
So it is the logical conclusion that people vote for or against certain faces
It also makes political debate ever more difficult if the supporters of one side accuse the other, that they are just sheep following their leader, disregarding the opposing sides interests
You can't have political discourse if neither side accepts that there are differences of oppinion and a differences of interests
It's deeply troubling and social media amplifies it
Where you once could have a civilised debate with acquaintances over a glass of wine or beer, you are now electronically screaming at each other
No, it happens in pretty much all elections
Strategic voting is absolutely a thing
lmao
Tons of people love the green party (I don't)
And a huge part fo the country absolutely despises the openly racist FPÖ.
The Polish party system really is a weird one with both main parties having spawned from the same voting block
Apart from the rampant nationalism and revanchism (both internal and external) PIS aint't all that dissimilar from Christian Social parties in the rest of Europe, if you go back 50 or so years that is
Take Germany, the CDU/CSU basically is KO and PIS united, moderating both wings and finding commin ground
How come
I think that due to the proportional representation, you don't have to vote tactically (except for the very small <4% party voters)
So I would be grateful if you could clarify
I knew about the FPÖ but around here people are more open about hating the green party than the FPÖ (idk may be because of my dad), and I kind of assumed that that‘s the same around the country, sorry for that
The CDU is nothing like PiS
The closest equivalent to PiS is the AfD
You can criticize a lot about the Union but they would never ban abortion, destroy rule of law and endanger the neutrality of the courts
There are multiple reasons to vote strategic
Here are two examples:
Imagine you are left leaning and you really like WANDL, you could vote for WANDL and hope they get into the parliament
Or you could vote for the SPÖ to get them into the coalition
Because even though you agree less with the SPÖ you'd rather have a left party in coalition than your favorite party in opposition
There is also a ton of people who don't fully agree with any party
But they rather vote for the "smaller evil" than not at all
Sounds like you live in a pretty right wing bubble to be honest
The green party is pretty succesful in all bigger cities
In rural places not so much
They are more popular with more educated and younger people
There isn't one (major) party most people dislike
If you are in the center or left, you will dislike the FPÖ and ÖVP
If you are on the right you will dislike the Greens and SPÖ. NEOS are the odd one, because they are neo-liberals, they attract progressive people from the left and economically liberal people from the right
I see, yes I also believe that there is a shortage of a true left wing party in the parliament
The greens have become more centrist and the SPÖ is a bit too old fashioned and not actually that left wing
You‘re absolutely right that I live in an extremely right wing environment, and believe me, I hate it with my whole being
And I think my dad is the center of it with always screaming his opinion, which doesn‘t make it any better
Especially his choice of party, because I really believe he‘s homophobic and yeah, I‘m in the closet
But thanks, at least I now know what the rest of Austria is up to
One valid objection that I understand is aligning the Swiss direct democratic and federalist systems with the EUs legislative process
Either it would mean the EU had to wait until there was a Swiss plebiscite on certain topics and then the 8,5 swiss would dominate decissions for 440 million people or the Swiss would have to give up certain democratic rights
Both aren't really acceptable outcomes
Schappen: On 28th December (Feast of the Holy Innocents) kids go around the village with twigs and canes and whip grown ups while chanting verses
It's supposed to keep the people healthy and fertile
The children get money or sweets for the "blessing".
It's a thing in small parts of Austria and Slovenia, but I haven't seen kids do it in my village for quite a few years now
I think I heard of that and actually did it once
Idk I know back then my brother always had those big
idk how to call them made out of twigs (Usually Palmbuschen I think
) and I had one too I think
I don‘t know if it was actually for that day, but I do know that it was around christmas or at least the holidays
I‘m really not sure, but ever since I got to do it like twice or thrice I‘ve never seen,m or heard of it again and since I was young it slowly vanished from my memory
I agree and it‘s very sad
And since english is more relevant in our daily lives denglisch also slowly becomes more popular
And I‘m not really against it, hell I‘m using the shit out of denglisch myself because I see as I slowly forget how to speak actual german, but I still think it‘s sad
Both dialects and a part of our language is vanishing
cringe
absolute cringe
In Austria it's still baby Jesus haha
Santa Claus is very present in the media, but for children it's still the "Christkindl" (baby Jesus) that brings the presents
Christkind is still around in southern germany and Austria
We even have "no power to santa" stickers
>Idk I know back then my brother always had those big
idk how to call them made out of twigs (Usually Palmbuschen I think
Yeah, we also always made them out of white willow (which become Palmkätzchen in spring)
Palmbuschen are those things you make during Easter where you combine Palmkätzchen and 6 other kinds of twigs
Oh, thank you, I forgot the word for that and just assumed it was all the same
There are different traditions
In eastern Austria it tends to be a male childlike angel, though the young woman form is also found
Because Halloween is a fully commercialized holliday that is getting pushed so that some people can profit of it
And its killing other similar traditions that are not just about money
Yes, my mom is American and I have lived in the US and we used to celebrate Halloween
While Halloween is already incredibly commercialized in the US, it is nothing but a money grab in Europe
We already have our own holidays where we get into costumes and stuff
And Halloween isn't really that "amazing" or "special" when you don't have nostalgic childhood memories of it
I usually drive "auf Sicht", which means "on sight" - so if I can see far enough to stop within a reasonable time I drive the speed limit, sometimes faster
If I can't see around a tight corner I adjust my speed so that I'm able to stop in a reasonable time
> especially in areas with blind corners or hills
You have hills in Denmark
It's tought to drive so you can stop within half the distance of your sight
How do people actually drive
Some very slow, some very fast and the vast majority at adequate speeds, i guess
I'm currently living way out in the countryside in Brittany (France)
Most people do 100 km/h (legal limit is 70) on very narrow country roads bordered by bocages
Two cars can fit side-by-side but both would have to have 1 tire practically in the grass
Every corner is a blind corner, sometimes there are tractor and bikes too
Often in the morning the area is covered in fog
None of my colleagues seem to find it strange/dangerous
>Is there a "law" in Germany where you have to give priority for the car going upwards
I live in a hilly area and I rarely see this happen
It's not law, but in the alps it's common courtesy to give the car going upwards priority
I remember in india in the mountains before blind curves, they had road signs telling you to honk
# Rainhard Fendrich - I am from Austria
It's basically like the second anthem
I read that as "morning wood" and was ready to compliment your liberal attitude
When I was little, the one cliché song for Italian settings always was "O sole mio", preferably sung by a gondoliere
Also "Funiculi, funicula".
Although I have to thank "Funiculi, funicula" for actually understanding what the Italian tourists want when they ask me for the way to the funicolare around here
The first thing I'd say when asked about an unofficial national anthem would be the [Blue Danube Waltz] especially since it was used in lieu of a de facto national anthem when Austria declared its independence in April 1945 because we simply didn't have one for the newly established Second Republic of Austria yet
Came here to say this
It absolutely is our second anthem and sums up a lot about us Austrians
The only Dutch song I know is "Zeven dagen lang" and I love it
When I was a little kid, Sweden was [Pippi Longstocking] land, but I doubt the theme song is iconic enough to represent a whole country
It's hard not to love that one, it's just so legendary
Surely Scotland the Brave should be on that list too
Song of the Volga Boatmen too, to mention another memorable and well-known Russian folk song
I really have no idea where the cliché even came from, but I remember reading somewhere that "O sole mio" gets requested by gondola tourists so often that a few years ago they considered banning it officially because it's just not a song from the region and some Venetians were quite pissed off about that
I can assure you that while people may criticize Wagner as a person, his works definitely aren't being dismissed from a musical standpoint
They're still regularly shown in venues around the world, which includes Germany of course ([Bayreuth Festival] for example)
From my own experience they are less popular with our audiences here than operas from other composers though, which may be partly due to their heavy pathos and lengthiness
several times where there are two places with similar names, except one name contains Big (Groß) and one Small (Klein)
Usually the "Small" has more people
&#x200B;
And plenty places with names that are not accurate "anymore". Eg
references to industrial places or nature things that don't exist anymore
[Fucking in Austria]
Let me tell you, it's not encouraged
Burgenland means "castle land/country", but the castle it refers too are nowadays not in Burgenland anymore, but in Hungary and Slovakia (depends what you count, it was first named "four castle country" but after Pressburg (Bratislava) became a part of Czechoslovakia, it was renamed to castle country refering to 3 castles which stayed in Hungary when part of it became Austrian)
Schneeberg, meaning snow mountain
Guess what kind of precipitation is kinda rare there (at least compared to other surrounding, higher mountains)
In Upper Austria there's town called "Leonstein" (lit
Leon's/Lion's Stone), [there's no lions there]
The Lower Austrian town of "Wiener Neustadt" (lit
Viennese New City) is not in Vienna and not that new any more, it was founded in 1194
The Styrian town "Judenburg" (Jew's Borough) has only one Jew left (afaik), and that's the one in their [Coat of Arms] The others were killed, converted or expulsed in the 14th and 15th centuries
The Nazis considered to rename the city to Adolfburg, but then the whole business with the war came in the way
>And plenty places with names that are not accurate "anymore".
Österreich (Austria) itself kinda fits that
It just comes from "Osterrichi", initially just meaning "place in the east (of the Empire)" iirc
(Though I think its also taken as "Eastern Empire/Empire in the East" on occasion
) Either way, at this point it's not an Empire, not in an Empire and it's not really the noteworthy farthest east of anything in particular either as far as I know
Styria too
"Steiermark", comes from the city of Styer and it being a "Mark" (march
), an outer border region (of an Empire)
While it is still a border state, Styer is no longer in Styria, it belongs to Upper Austria now, and there is again no Empire
Also I'm fairly sure marches are usually fortified, which isn't quite accurate anymore either
And Burgenland
Got its name for three important(?) places with "Burg" in their name, all of which are in Hungary and not a part of Burgenland
and Frauenstein does in fact allow residents of any gender as well
At least not in public
Residents do get free pornhub subscriptions though
I'm not joking
Actually 4 ..burgs, back when it was part of the Hungarian part
Pressburg (Bratislava)
Wieselburg (Mosonmagyaróvár)
Ödenburg (Sopron)
Eisenburg (Vas)
Now that region is part Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia
Also, Vorarlberg should be Hinterarlberg
There is also the town Groß klein(big small) and klein klein(small small) in southern styria
> Österreich (Austria) itself kinda fits that
It just comes from "Osterrichi", initially just meaning "place in the east (of the Empire)" iirc
(Though I think its also taken as "Eastern Empire/Empire in the East" on occasion
) Either way, at this point it's not an Empire, not in an Empire and it's not really the noteworthy farthest east of anything in particular either as far as I know
Partially correct
Austria at this time was part of the Bavarian duchy and Ostarrichi certainly was the most Eastern part of Bavarian controlled land
"Richi" didn't refer to Empire in the classical sense but rather land directly controller by a ruler
> Styer
*Steyr
The exact etymology isnt known, as far as I can tell
It's true that "richi" can also come from "realm" (as in "Herrschaftsbereich"), but it's not necessarily so and still doesn't clarify which one, though it meaning Bavaria is probably the most obvious/likely
But it's not a proven thing, exactly
The only thing that's really sure is that it was first officially mentioned as "the region that in the common(ers) language is called Osterrichi", with no further explanation (regarding what that word means, etymologically speaking) and that it is very likely (but not 100% for sure) an old Bavarian term
Like I said, it's been translated different ways over the centuries, though some of those are more likely to be right than others (Empire in the East is definitely not it, for example)
The most likely one is probably just "A place in the East of the Realm", either generally the Imperial or specifically the Bavarian one
Admittedly after checking again, Bavarian seems somewhat more likely
But to my understanding both "rihi" (ahd) and "richi" (mhd) can mean both
("Herrschaftsgebiet/bereich", more likely to be Bavaria, as well as generally "Reich", more likely to be the Empire)
I'm no expert on medieval document language though, so maybe I'm missing some detail that clarifies it for sure, but to the best of my knowledge it cant be said with complete certainty
You again
First you reject the Leberkaskrapfen and now that
I actually do
Sorry
Maybe these ppl are from countries where regional minorities seem to have a hard time
Looking at you, Spain
I am not talking about the language but the region
There have been again huge protests the last few years due to the central government trying to enforce things there
I am not talking about languages but regions
Catalan sovereignty is a huge issue of contention
yes, but my wife isn't currently working so she cooks fresh meals everyday and usually we eat together with the kids when I come from work
Imho that's the great difference from the 90's, that one income families were more common
Remember back to the 90's, my father was 3 shift working in a mine and later in glass works, which meant I didn't see him at all on some school days and some days we had the whole day time
But honestly it's also much self induced hurry, when I moved out and working in the early 2000, I took the time to cook a prober meal after 10 hours at work (paid overtime)
As someone who started working in the 1990 - I have much more quality time at my hands now than back then, tbh
Granted, we don't have that many family meals - but that's mainly because husband and I both work from home, so we're together a lot anyway
Wearing Dirndln or Lederhosen wasn't much of a thing in my part of the country until fairly recently
Same here
We have teams of de-lockers regularly visit all the bridges to cut them off to prevent bridges from collapsing
I'd say Vienna feels the most foreign to a majority of Austrians
It's much bigger than any other place here (over 1,5 Million inhabitants more than our second biggest city, Graz) and unlike most other bigger Austrian cities it's quite far away from the Alps
There's also a pronounced multicultural and especially slavic influence in Vienna due to history
It's strange as it couldn't be more Austrian but as somebody from an area close to Salzburg I would say that Vienna feels foreign, at least for me
It's so disproportionately big for a small country like Austria
It almost feels like its own city-state with its own (social/cultural) rules
Also many many small things add to this personal feeling
Zebra crossings look different in Vienna than in the rest of Austria, the climate is dryer than where I live, in the east it's really flat, there are grapevines growing (which I always associate with holidays), the trains are different (e.g. ÖBB 4020), the infrastructure is on a much bigger scale, etc
Once an old lady in Vienna asked me where I'm from and then she said "Ohhhh, Sie sind aus den Bundesländern" ("ohhh, you're from the districts") which felt like somebody from the capital of Panem said "oh, you're from one of our districts".
It feels like there is Austria and then also Vienna
Like they would be separated
Technically the Vienna Forest, particularly Leopoldsberg, is the very last northeastern tail of the Alpine Arc
So *technically* Vienna has Alps within its city limits
But I know what you mean
You mean actual mountains, not wine-hills
Still, I wouldn't say it's "far". Schneeberg isn't that far away
I was in Rotterdam, the Hague, Amsterdam and a few smaller cities and Texel back in 2019
Rotterdam was my favourite place
Yeah but most bigger Austrian cities like Graz, Linz, Salzburg and Innsbruck are in Western Austria and therefore much closer to the "real" Alps than Vienna
the second one; the first one is a general phenomenon in all german speaking countries i think
Linz is in fact much further from the Alps than Vienna
Linz is very close to the Bohemian massif (which begins beyond the Danube, but also reaches south of the Danube in the Kürnberger Wald in Leonding)
But you need to drive around 50 minutes to the south, over the great Voralpenland plain, in order to see some Alps
The people were the nicest and the weed was cheaper
The beach was pretty nice and the food was good
Overall I've enjoyed my two days in rotterdam very much
I also enjoyed Apeldoorn very much for pretty much the same reasons sans the beach
I mixed it up I meant the beach at the Hague
German is the most spoken mother language in the EU
German is just messed up Dutch
>Most other Europeans fought 2 world wars to stop this from happening
Well, not me
Mostly because I wasn't alive during that time
quick idea: let's use latin for that again
Also, a lot of Gastarbeiter already speak it (at least a bit) - so it's a good base for learners in Eastern Europe
proposition: update your *whole* orthography and we're talking
Wer sog „dös“?
Pretty sure english is one of the youngest languages
A mixture or french, germanic, norse and a tad gaelic
Latin is really hard to use in everyday life
With the verb at the end of sentences, you're listening to someone and your brain is constantly like "Spit it out, what was Cindy doing to her dog
Walking
Cuddling

Worse
giving an ultimatum to Serbia I suppose
Letting an austrian painter move to germany
Not letting that guy get into art school, twice
the Anschluss
Should be obvious
Ya'll ever heard of World War 1
ik zie het als een absolute overwinning
...and thinking we could actually fight amd win a Balkan war without it becoming a World War
This seems somehow familiar, i dont know why though
Keeping him as a bum in Vienna would be a more fitting occupation
I would say not having a general strike and bigger insurrection in 1934
Because there is no chance in hell that the Social Democrats in a democratic system would agree with the German demands
German-Catholic fascist in the conservative party trying to create a fascist state of their own and failing hard on the other hand
The alternative would be trusting the Soviets and letting them move army units to the German-Polish border like they wanted
Preferable to the Germans who tried to eradicate the Polish nation (again) but this time to the last person but still who would trust Stalin, massive prick that he was
Also, going back 50 years: allowing Franz Joseph to go full-out Neoabsolutism after the 1848 revolution
There was a referendum and all that
What definitely was our fault was the whole situation leading up to the Anschluss
Austria was weak in 1938
Well, people tried to not allow him that
The thing is, the reactionaries had a bunch of battle-tested armies (bc of wars in Italy, Bohemia), with heavy artillery and some seasoned generals (Windischgrätz, Radetzky), the Ban Jellachic's marauding Croat troops, and the support of most of the Slavic lands *and* the support of Russia (which was a secret tool that would help them later
in slaughtering the Hungarian revolutionaries)
The revolutionaries had Vienna
With the dead Minister of War hanging from a lantern post
And with some rifles
And a few cannons
And newspapers
Looots of newspapers
What I'm trying to say is, they didn't stand a chance
Basically, yes, but it was a bit more complicated
Comparing it with the Crimea referendum is not really appropriate
Illegal Nazis (the Nazi party had been illegal under the Austro-fascist regime) had already infiltrated the Austrian government
Then one day before the "Einmarsch" happend, the Nazis, Arthur Seyß-Inquart to be precise, completely took over the government
On the 12th of March 1938 Wehrmacht and German police took control of Austria, with people cheering them on in the streets
On the 13th of March, Nazi-Chancellor Seyß-Inquart officially signed the "Anschluss"-law
This was possible so fast and easily, because as chancellor he had a too high amount of competences, due to the preceding Austro-fascist regime
Pogromes ensued: Jews were harrassed, shops and synagogues burned down
This happened **without** the official directive of the Nazi party, Austrians (Nazis, Anti-semites, thugs, regular people) did that all by themselves
The governement in Berlin had to send out a directive to their party officials in Vienna, to chill the fuck down and control the situation
However, the Nazi-leadership also got inpired by those riots, they were a main inspiration for the "Kristallnacht" in November later that year
In order to make all of this look a bit more democratic on the international stage, the Nazis organized a [referendum] in April 1938
The new German citizens in the lands of former Austria were supposed to answer [this double-question about the "Anschluss" and about Hitler as the leader] (observe the size of the two circles tho)
Jews, "mixed" people, and political prisoners were not allowed to vote (=8% of the electorate) 99% voted with "Yes". There was also a parallel referendum about the Anschluss in "Old Germany", the result was the same
You can imagine how "democratically" that whole referendum went down
With SA-thugs waiting in the polling stations and people filling out the form in front of the officials in order to disperse suspicions of being "against the system" and stuff like that
In reality it is estimated that "only" about 60-80% of Austrians probably were in favor of Anschluss at that time, while probably around 30% where actual supporters of the NSDAP
But we can't be too sure about those figures
> in Germany we learn that we forced it onto you through pressure from our armed forces but I guess that's just half the story
"Opfermythos" nennt man das bei uns und war bis zur [Waldheimaffäre] in den 80ern die gängige Meinung in der Mehrheitsgesellschaft in Österreich
Da hat sich seither aber sehr viel geändert und getan
Heute wissen die meisten Österreicher, dass nicht "die bösen Deutschen" die Täter waren und "wir" die Opfer, sondern dass "wir" Teil der "bösen Deutschen" waren, und vielfach Österreicher in führenden Positionen im NS-Regime bzw
in der Durchführung des Holocaust tätig waren
Und dass der Anschluss nunmal keineswegs eine feindliche Übernahme war, sondern für die meisten Österreicher ein Freudenereignis
"Endlich ist der Führer da
Jetzt wird alles besser" hieß es damals
Es ist in den Jahrgängen 1938/39 auch ein deutlicher "Spike" in den Geburtenstatistiken zu verzeichnen, weil wenn sich die Leute freuen, dann budern sie auch mehr
Temperature isn't a good indicator on that
5 degrees can be warm with the right amount of humidity and no wind
5 degrees can also be freezing with a bad amount of humidity and much wind
There are days I can comfortably walk around the city at -5°C in my thin wintercoat and then there are days were I am freezing my balls off at +5°C in the same coat
Fuck this shit, I ain't leaving the bed: -20 downwards
Cold: 3 to -19
Chilly: 4 to 14
Nice: 15 to 20
Warm: 21 to 25
Hot: 26 to 39
The Apocalypse is nigh, may the devil have mercy on our soul: 40+
Cold: below 5
Chilly: 5 to 15
Nice: 15 to 25
Warm: 25 to 30
Hot: above 30
But in Austria it also heavily depends on what height you're on, 0° feel a lot colder at 2500m than at 250m.
Cold -10
Chilly  0
Nice 15
Warm 25
Hot 28
Tyrolean area
Cold: -20C - -5 C
Chilly: -5C - 10 C
Nice: 10-20 C
Warm: 20C - 30C
Hot: 30C+
so, 27c to 30c is "why can't I spend the whole day in the kiddie pool while you kill me"?
I think it also matters at what height you are
0°C at 2500m feels like - 5°C at 250m
Is snow en la Concha that common
I thought it's more of exception there
Like sunshine
or anything else that's not rain
It's ok, we know you Danes aren't so good with numbers
I'm thinking alcohol
Lots of it
48° ... close enough ... it's fine, really
You get used to it
Sundown today is at 16:03 google tells me
Where the name comes from
There's theories, but ultimately, no one knows
Same with the flag, but people chose their favourite myth in that regard
That time when Austria became an Archduchy, something never heard or seen before
But the Emperor thought it was a good idea to make his hereditary titel on par with the Arch Bishops and the Imperial electors, so he forged a bunch of documents providing him with many new privileges and consolidating several he already had
So from then on we had Arch Dukes because normal Duke wasn't enough
Took them another few centuries before they dropped the ducal facade and just declared Austria an Empire by itself so they could keep that title too
The name Österreich (German word for Austria for those who don't know) came from "Ostarrichi" and was first mentioned like a millennium ago
It doesn't literally mean "Eastern realm" ("Ostreich") in modern German nor in the language that was spoken at the time afaik, but that's the mainstream theory of what the name most likely means
However, no one knows who came up with the name, how long the region was called that, if it really means eastern realm and if so, what "eastern" relates to here
Is it the eastern part of Bavaria (the settlement area of the [Baiuvarii] tribe) or the eastern part of the [Frankish Empire] which existed before and/or roughly around the time Austria was first mentioned by name, or was it something else entirely
It connects us to Turkey
Both our flags are drenched in Turkish blood
The HRE didn't yet exist at the time
But yeah, most likely we were just called the eastern realm of east Francia
As far as I know Ostmark was only used by the nazis as an attempt to weaken the Austrian national identity
So Ostmark was really only used officially from 1938 to 1945 and maybe inofficially a short time around that window
Almost any bit of Italian got me a smile in Italy
While I am probably still capable of ordering ball bearings with a business letter, my spoken Italian unfortunatly rusted over time to the point where I can order a bistecca at a restaurant
Similarly some words of Germanic origin are very obvious for German natives while they may seem impressive for English natives
Like saying whom instead of who, which is just like German "wem". So for me it's the most obvious thing in the world but Anglos tend to be quite impressed by it
I remember when I was at a restaurant in Napoli and I wanted to order the bill but I didn't quite remember how to say it in Italian ("Il conto per favore")
So, I just said "l'addizione per favore", which is just the French "l'addition s'il vous plaît" translated into Italian only that it doesn't make much sense in this situation
They instantly broke out in laughter but they absolutely loved it
Very funny situation

I‘m a huge fan of Juventus‘ redesigned logo
It‘s simplicity in a pure form
Old fans might disagree,though

I have to agree

Just let the government run religious institutions and look at how stale and backwards it will become
That's the reason why there aren't that many religious people in Europe
Officially most people are catholic in Austria and they might even claim to be religious but most just believe in a god but not the christian god
If people ask me if I am religious and my answer is no, they immediatly want me to clarify if I just don't believe in the church or generally in no god
Fewer and fewer actually believe in the religion portrayed by churches and those who are left will die with their beliefs, no matter what the church is doing
A mild version would be an improvement

In my youth, I used to ride my bicycle right past [Mozart's birthplace] every day on my way to school but I've never actually been inside
I live somewhat close to Hallstatt but up until last year it was always so overrun that I never really bothered to go there
I went there twice last year with friends
Was quite pretty actually
I live near the KZ Mauthausen and wanted to go there, but because of Corona I didn't get the chance
I have been living for more than 12 years in Vienna now and I have never been to Schönbrunn
I lived in london for a few months
A visit was quite obligatory
As a regular tourist its horrible
You cant go there by bus, and the fees are exorbitant
Fortunately with a car you can just stop by
Sneaking in wasn‘t too hard as well
But i dont recommend to pay 50gbp for this
Kohlmarkt and Freyung are just streets, you've not been there
Never been at Naschmarkt
Hinterbrühl isn't in Vienna, neither is Burg Liechtenstein
All in all you could do with a bit more culture in your life
Last summer the Bundescard, which gets you into a fair few of these places, was only €20
It was totally worth it
I'm not even viennese and I've been to a lot of those places
Du bist ja no jung ;)
Ehhhhh bester Stand Josefstädter U-Bahnstation
I thought too but it was in Google's Vienna sightseeing list so I put it in anyway
Yup, those streets never were on my way tho
I guess they will sooner or later
I also thought that I might have been to some on the list but I can't remember
That's kind of the point
If you live in Vienna you don't have a Wienwoche :P
Kommt drauf an aus welcher Sicht :)
Where to go during quarantine
But before
I barely went outside
I have a problem
Never heard of it
But I have to say that I dislike clubs/bars
So what do you guys do
Geh wäh, den find ich gar net gut dort
When you're living here you miss some sights many want to visit
It's not that I don't like to go there
It's just that you have a live here and easily forget that you actually could visit those places
Tho you get to visit mist of them sooner or later (in school, excursions, work, etc
No, I meant instead of Wienwoche
What excursions did your school do
Ja, genau, so ein kleines Standl das tut als obs zum (sehr superen) Lokal daneben ghören würde
Tuts aber net
I guess just the typical ones
Going up the Stephens Cathedral, visiting some museums (Albertina, Mumok, Naturhistorisches Museum, Kunsthistorisches Museum), visiting Schloss Schönbrunn (plus it's park), going through the city center (first district) in general, some history lessons outside, etc
Geb ich dir recht :)
Ich mag den vom Kebabhaus in der Faulmanngasse recht gern
Allerdings mag ich nur Lamm-Döner, da wird die Auswahl immer enger ...
We just start from 21
The word „einundzwanzig“ (and „zweiundzwanzig“ (22), „dreiundzwanzig“ (23) and so on) perfectly fits in a second if spoken properly/not too fast
I guess the Montan-University with it's specialisation in a bit niche but demanded fields like Tunnel engineering, Mining and Petrochemistry is a good candidate
In STEM, aka one of the best paid job fields and also one where most people will get a degree in, telematics is really looked up to
Engineering/STEM jobs overall tho
I almost exclusively know engineers
Most of them actively seek out higher education and some get a degree
There are many universities that teach any kind of engineering too, as far as I know
(Have to add: I‘m an electrical engineer currently in higher education
I don‘t have much information about degrees in any other kind of engineering other than the basics
Teachers too
Professors specifically since you have to get a bunch of degrees to become a professor
And teacher because nobody wants to deal with some of these disrespectful pre-pubescent teens
All STEM fields
Especially Chemical Engineering
We are very good with that but it is a super hard field and , at my university, only about 20 people a year finish the BSc, most go on for a MSc and the Phd
It is very difficult to learn but you get paid a lot
Not me but a friend who almost never travels out of the country: Smoking in restaurants and bars
For a while now we've been one of the last countries in central and western Europe that allow it
He was really surprised other countries banned it many years ago
That will change soon however, from November on it will be banned here too
I think it kind of sucks but I suppose it's better that way in the long tern
also Radler
but you're fine if you go to a somewhat typical german tourist destination
just been to lago di garda and got greeted with apfelschorle
We have that too
At least both my grandparents
Most people don't do it at home anymore
But if you are getting lunch in any restaurant there is always a soup included
In autumn you will see cars parked left and right on rural streets
All from city people who drive into the forests and go mushroom picking
Even fucking Italians come here and pick our mushrooms
We even introduced border controls for mushrooms, because the Italians are picking tons and selling it in Italy
Austrian chiming in its a shame that Tracht seems to go away except for those few weeks where Oktober fest is happening in munich and the smaller one here in Vienna
In Austria it's "Apfelsaft gespritzt" --> long live Austria-Hungary ;)
We do
Until next week
The problem is still that the workers have to work in smoking environments
Workers protection is strong here
One of the things the country is built on
Vienna is different though
You can’t compare Vienna to the countryside
Here in Tyrol, our Tracht is very common and seen on feast days, weddings, birthdays, ...
Every valley/region has its own typical Tracht
We‘ve also got the [Tiroler Schützen] and every village has its own marching band
They‘re marching through the villages on feast days ([procession] weddings, birthdays, funerals (of a member)
Sometimes the Schützen wake me up on sunday mornings, since they shoot with blanks to salute
Okay yea sorry for the oversimplification, I'm from lower Austria so I tend to wear Tracht on those days you mentioned as well, but tbh I only see my generation putting on a Dirndl when it comes to these October fest events, where you're more attention-grabbing if you don't wear Tracht
What I meant was when given the choice between Dirndl and a normal dress for a wedding most women I know (20 to 25yrs) don't even think a Dirndl would be appropriate
Probably Turkey: they colonized large parts of Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia and ran a huge slave trade but nobody seems to care
Brits were the worst, but Belgium is up there
Related to that: [A father stares at the hand and foot of his five-year-old daughter, severed as a punishment for having harvested too little rubber
May 1904, Congo] Humans can be so, so cruel
No offense, but how are we any more responsible for WW2 than the Germans
And why didn't we exist
Well, but the whole opium thing and the amount of people who starved in India adds up kinda
Except we don't act as if we were innocent
Our attrocities in WW2 and the reasons leading to the rise of National Socialism are the biggest topics in history class for instance
Which kept the Swedes from being invaded and getting their cities turned to rubble themselves
For them cooperation was the only reasonable choice
Austrias Gold helped Hitler, he needed it to continue with his plans, wasnt just a strategic question
The one with the little moustache was born in Austria but lost his citizenship when he joined the German army
Technically when he rose to power he wasn't legally Austrian
He didn't acknowledge the Austrian state nor it's institutions
But yes many Austrians were fanatic Nazis
And how we treated the Balkans and Italy 100 years before wasn't quite too nice either
Do you consider communist elections in Czechoslovakia also free and fair
It's not like they were open elections and soldiers with guns weren’t posted in front of the election buildings
Well we are a federation of nine countries, so each one is somewhat autonomous
AFAIK other places like switzerland give their local countries even more rights than us but still
There are areas of Austria (mostly along the sothern/southeastern border) that have special provisions like bilingual schools and kindergartens and signs for the Slovenian, Hungarian and Croat minorities
But there are no autonomous administrative regions as there are no majority minority areas
The Austrian states are not really autonomous
That's why there's a "somewhat". That's the point of a federation - some autonomy, some central government
Austria would be thicc again :)
edit: No wait
if we didn't regain the old lands we would be even smaller than now D:
Napoleon (I don't know the how manyth) would probably invade Vienna every Monday morning and leave again by late afternoon
"glad" to hear Austria is not the only one doing that
Really appreciated the relatively consistent measures that Sweden had, spent the first half of the pandemic (so far) there
Are apricot (or other fruit) dumplings a thing outside of Austria
So, here in Austria we got dumplings made from either potato or [topfen] dough filled with whole apricots ([Marillenknödel] They always come with "Brösel" (a breadcrumb and sugar mixture roasted in - ideally - clarified butter), which are nearly as important as the dumpling itself, and plenty of powder sugar
These are considered a great classic of Austrian/Viennese cuisine
There is also other fruits that can be used, like plums or strawberries, but these are not as "classic".
However I don't think I ever heard of similar dishes elsewhere, especially not that they would be held in nearly such high regard
So: are fruit filled dumplings "a thing" elsewhere
Do you also have "Brösel" with them or some other side
Yeah we have a lot of shared (cooking) history, that's for sure \^\^
But how does it work with blueberries, these dumplings must be tiny
> Aprikosen
don't even get me started on your German food terms ... \*cringes* ;)
Maybe they have them in eastern Galicia
Seems to be a pretty widespread thing in both Poland and former Austria-Hungarian territories
cinnamon ... ginger ... currants ... sounds nice
Somehow reminds me of Kletznbrot ("bread" with spices and dried fruits mixed in), though they sound softer (Kletznbrot can be quite hard)
> My first thought; what does something like this even look like
See link in op
> Second thought; are apricots grown in Austria
Yep, along the danube, especially in the Wachau
[Wachauer Marille] is actually a protected geographical indication
Only difference: in Germany they put mushroom sauce over top ;)
Get potato dough package from store, take core out of apricots (and if you are a grandma replace with a cube of sugar for that extra sweetness kick), make potato dough as per packaging and wrap apricots in it, boil as per packaging
Crumbs: get some butter into a pan, throw in some breadcrums and sugar (I'd say about 2-3:1 ratio should be _plenty_ sweet), roast until they are nice and golden brown
It's really not hard
Unless you want to make the dough yourself (though that's mainly because I got zero idea about it)
But the dough is made from potatoes
With the similarity to the German word "Knödel" or in Austrian dialect even "Knedl" I would be shocked if they were much different
I have actually seen them as "Marillenknödel" on the manu in Saxony, close to the Czech border
Only because by pure coincidence the English picked up the same word stem ;)
You've been banned from /r/aeiou
Außerdem, Quark vergessen (Topfen haßt des
Baked
Yeah if you'd boil the dough I can imagine it getting nice and soft
8 pc Apricots
800 	g  Potatoes (the kind you would use for making mashed potatoes)
100 	g All purpose flour
80 	g Semolina
1 pc	Egg yol
1 	pinch salt
60 	g 	Butter
200 	g 	Breadcrumbs
120 	g 	Butter (für the breadcrumbs)
If you can't get Semolina, in a pinch probably even corn meal or polenta will do
It's corn, not wheat, but I think it should still work
1) Wash and throughly dry the apricots
2) Boil the potatoes until soft and mash them
3) Add semolina, yolk, melted butter, flour and salt and mix throughly until a soft, smooth dough forms
This is similar to a Gnocchi dough
4) Form dough into a roll and cut off discs
Put Apricot in the middle of the disk and form dough into a ball around it
You have to go with your gut here, the size of the roll depends on the size of your apricots
You are looking at an even coating of dough, maybe half to a centimeter thick
This is the kind of thing grandmothers fight about, it depends on what you want your dough/apricot ratio to be
5) Melt the other butter in a pan and roast the bread crumbs until golden brown
Stir constantly, they burn very easily
I would recommend that you also add a good amount of sugar to the breadcrumbs
As you can see in the recipe, there's no sugar in the dough and you can't always depend on the sweetness of the apricots
6) Bring a large pot with lightly salted water to a simmer and put the dumplings in there for about 10 minutes
7) Fish them out, let them dry for a bit, then put into the pan with the bread crumbs and coat thoroughly
Eat while still hot but not too hot because the apricots will burn the roof of your mouth off
Oh the pain ... here you can get [potato dough powder] in any supermarket where you just add water
It's not the greatest but a whole lot less work ;)
Actually if you got to make dough on your own anyhow, you should definitely make the curd based dough from /u/little_bohemian's recipe (from the 1st link)
It's way more fluffy and nice, but always has to be handmade (which is the reason why it's rarer, I guess)
> Italian - albicocca
Ironically because Marille actually comes from italian armellino
Dammit, this guy might be right
Not for speaking Hochdeutsch, for speaking the germany-version of Hochdeutsch
What infuriates us the most is that you assume that our nice austrian Hochdeutsch- expressions like Topfen or Marille might be just dialect words
Go tell an english person that "autumn" and "trousers" are provicial dialect words
No problem
Oh, and you can remove the pit of the apricots by poking them from the top with e.g. the handle of a wooden spoon or something or just making a slit on one side (though the larger the opening, the more juice will escape)
You don't have to, it's fine to leave them in, but you can
One of my grandmothers used to replace the pit with a bit of marzipan
You do you :)
Probably a Döner, 2nd choice would be some Asia noodles, 3rd choice McDonald's
Yup same here
Not leaving before they throw me out
Second this
The good thing about eating McDonalds while being completely shitfaced: When you inevitably throw it up again, it still tastes exactly the way it did when you ate it
We might have a Döner or Pizza-slice as well but if you feel real Austrian you'll want to get a [Käsekrainer]
You guys have gay spars
I rather have myself a hot Burenheidl, at my local neighbourhood Hurenbeidl
And have another beer with it
A Krainer is a sausage from Krain, i.e. Slovenia
"Käsekrainer" is the Austrian variation where you infuse the Krainer with cheese
In 2012 Austria and Slovenia even had a whole court battle over the naming rights
My guess: Because the neighbours want to sleep
And the owners of the garden don't want to constantly pay police fines for noise disturbances
I hope someone will google that :D
its not cultural nuances between northern and southern germany, those are the nuances between germany and austria (and austrian influeced germany aka bavaria)
It's not, as it is extremly Austrian
The Käsekrainer was invented in Upper Austria in the 1960s/1970s. But the base sausage Krainer (i.e. without the cheese) is traditionally Slovenian (Krain = Slovenia)
[That one is for you only]
Tatsächlich
Das ist schön (und amüsant) zu hören, aber wenn man es sich recht überlegt auch nicht allzu überraschend
Es war ja doch nur eine Frage der Zeit, bis die zahlreichen deutschen NC-Flüchtlinge bei ihrer unweigerlichen Rückkehr in die Bundesrepublik unsere dem jahrhundertelang vorherrschenden altösterreichsichem Vielvölkergemisch entsprungenen kulinarischen Schätze in den hohen Norden mitbringen
Wohl bekomms
I've always wondered why americans call them steins
Where did you get that word from
Gösser Radler ist mittlerweile fast Standard im Hamburger späti
Da wäre es wirklich spannend, ob das von den nc-flüchtling-heimkehrern mitgebracht wurde, oder mehr das "exotisch- importiert" und urlaubsgefühl dazu beigetragen hat
(abgesehen davon, dass der/das Radler einfach gut ist)
Vll ein bissl was von beidem
Probably [St
Stephen's Cathedral]
or [Schönbrunn Palace] both in Vienna
The first building that came to my mind was the [Hofburg] in Vienna or the [Museum of Fine Arts]
But to be fairly honest right now, I barely know foreigners that know anything about Austria, so finding a building people know is really difficult for me rn
Edit: Also saw somebody else talk about Schönbrunn and St Stephens Cathedral and gotta agree with them too
Just the view from a foreigner (who never saw Star Wars): La Sagrada Familia is the only one I _didn‘t_ have to google, because I knew right away, but the other two are pretty iconic too (I didn‘t know the name but I they did look very familiar)
I always thought the Poles hate that building because it remembers them on the soviet time
From a foreigner's perspective I'd say that the first thing that comes to mind thinking of the Netherlands would be giant windmills surrounded by tulip fields
So maybe the windmills at Kinderdijk or even De Gooyer could do
Really cool but it's the first time I've seen/heard of it
It stands at the very center of the city
For Viennese and probably most people from the eastern part of Austria it is the defacto symbol of the city
The other sights are important, but the church has a special place
Not only due to beeing the central point to which most larger streets lead to  in the inner city and where the Emperors are burried, but due to it beeing a symbol of rebuilding the country after WW2
Apart from that it is also associated with some of the few acts of Austrian resistance against the Nazi regime
> where the Emperors are burried
Only the Emperors' intestines are buried there
The Emperors' bodies are buried in the Kaisergruft in the Kapuzinerkloster at Neuer Markt
Their hearts are in the Augustiner Church
Don't forget about [St Mary's Basilica] in Krakow
Both the exterior and [the interior are mind-blowing] and I believe it will be the first thing to come to mind for anybody who's visited Poland
Palace of Culture and Science is also iconic and arguably the most popular, but just like many other landmarks in Poland it reminds of sad times in the Polish history and I just wish the rest of the Europe saw more beauty in this country, as it surely deserves it
Disclaimer: I'm not a bike commuter (yet)
This is highly different
Here in Vienna older (steel) road bikes seem to be a bit popular
A few years ago there was a hype about fixies and single speeds
I also know of people who commute with their 2000 € carbon road bike and carry it up into the office
Also a relative of mine lives on the countryside and rides 30km with his E-Bike (he is nearly 60) to work if it isn't raining
Most important feature might be a bell and lights if you also ride in winter
Also your bike should be conform to road safety regulations because police is checking a lot of bikers in Vienna
I don't know why one should veer into another lane
There are bike courses in ground school (I don't know if every ground school does this) and you can get bike driver license (which allows you to ride your bike alone before the age of 12 if I correctly remember)
I live in Vienna, where a lot of people commute with bikes and/or public transport instead of cars
My bike's a 26" mountainbike
I like the flexibility, and the suspension fork :)
> How do you learn to ride in traffic without veering into another lane
Serious question: Why on earth would you
Riding a bike in a straight line is really not hard
I would say city bikes are very popular, especially among students who can't afford road bikes (das sind Rennräder oder
And if you have to leave them outside then usually those bikes are rather cheap ones or old ones, because they occasionally get stolen
I think one of the most important equipment is a helmet
Riding a bike in heavy traffic is dangerous
Not every city has decent bike paths
I think it is important to always expect other people to not see you and especially don't count on them stopping for you even if you are in the right
It's just a matter of practice I guess
I couldn't imagine living in the city without a bicycle
It’s becoming a problem in the alps
Especially accident wise as those guys thing that forrest roads are super easy to navigate and then are surprised that things like cattle grids and drains are not 100% bike friendly
And I am not even speaking of the real downhill trails
All of them except Nazi and Allied occupation I guess
9th-13th century: HRE Prince
13th century-1918: Great power of Europe
1918-present: Small European country
same
Plus the 10 years of occupation by the Allied Forces after WWII ending in 1955
Yes "we" (i.e. our grand and great-grand parents) were, but "Austria" didn't exist during that time i.e. it wasn't sovereign
I can tell you, he definitely didn't want to play the victim card here
It's not like I was disappointed, but I'm not a big fan of Paris
I was actually pretty disappointed by Paris
It's smelly, the traffic is whack and it's just not as special as it's always portrayed
I guess you should've ventured out of the Inner City a bit then
2004 and 2018
Not a bad place per se, but I didn't find it all too appealing/interesting
It's never warm in England tough
It's sometimes jokingly referred to as 'ottacrime'
But all jokes aside - otk is alright
to give a bit of a different answer than most, I think it's totally fine
as long as you act a bit apologetic about it, or at least marginally self-aware that what you're asking for is probably not in the best interest for the bar owner (you trying to spend little money instead of a lot)
doesn't mean they won't be happy for the business they get with you, doesn't mean that you have to be all I'm really very sorry or not dare to ask for it at all
but in my experience NA Anglos often try to be friendly by being open and jovial, and while that alone can sometimes be good or a bit much depending on person and situation, having it combined here with a situation where it would probably be better to act a bit
subdued, it can probably happen that you'll be scoffed at, for having the gall to ask while acting all proud of it at the same time as well
this goes in general by the way: if you have to ask, don't be all naive and friendly about it, instead act like you're sorry for having to ask
the reactions you get will be much better
I can only guess as to why, but suspect it's because we culturally put the responsibility of reading a situation correctly/getting social cues/just generally knowing stuff more on the learner, and not as much on the teacher
- A little bit of Mesopotamian cultures
- a little bit of Egypt
- *a lot* about Greeks (in all their shapes and forms), Romans and Celts (the ones that lived here of course, not the island Celts)
- a bit about Phoenicians/Carthago
- quite a bit about the tribal migration period in the late Antiquity/early Middle Age period and its various protagonist peoples/tribes (Hunns, Goths, Vandals, Langobards, Franks, Alemans etc
etc
- in religion class: ancient desert peoples that are featured in the Old Testament
That's too long to remember, we started history lessons with Schliemann and his discoveries about Troy and Mycenaean Greece
I'm pretty Sure the Curriculum changed since I've went to school, I was pretty sad that we learned so little about the celts, a bit about Hallstatt culture
[The aqueduct

We say it like, sorry for the weird example, the guy in the HA

Except not this short, it‘s more like hhaa, so you can really hear that it’s a h. That‘s for the alphabet, if it‘s in a word like idk Höhle [cave] then the a behind is unheard
Sounds kind of like _huh
_ Sometimes it‘s also a silent letter
E.g. word Höhle [cave] again, the first H is pronounced, the second is silent
And in the alphabet A and H aren‘t really similarly, maybe a lil bit, and in words not at all
Edit: Pretty mich pronounced like hurry or hide, I just read the comments below and found this example :‘D and for A, it‘s pronounced like the A in „darn it

I'll go anywhere
The only countries I'd exclude are some for safety reasons, traveling is great but you don't have to be stupid about it
But I'm happy that none of those are in Europe
Ramsan Kadyrov and his stance on LGTBQ people is enough of a reason not to go
Not saying its a bad place overall but the leadership is atrocious and I won't support a government like that
That's why I said (if you count that)
He doesn't know what he's missing, your country is grand
>  the Greek government
I'm confused
The southern Cypriot government, or the Greek governemnt of the country Greece
Cyprus isn't part of Schengen though
Okay, I understand
Djibouti and Timbuktu are used for that in (Austrian) German
My grandma always refers to Gigritzpatschen, an imaginative village in the middle of nowhere
Gigritz evidently mimics the sound a crow makes
Also, Hintertupfingen (behind-tupfing,a fantasy word) in Germany and Austria
Also “Schasklappersdorf”
Which
would be “fart-rattle-village”, I guess
Wait, "Dripsdrü" isn't a word my mum invented
Haven't heard that one before tbh
Really
I was surprised no one had mentioned it, because it’s so common around my family and group of friends
Maybe a Viennese thing
Idk
>Maybe a Viennese thing
While I'm not born and raised Viennese I've never lived further than 30km from the city (and currently live in Vienna) ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
A young American+British couple asked me whether there are mountains in Austria
Granted, they where hitchhiking in the Danube valley but you could even see the first alpine mountains from there
I have endless amounts of fun encounters with (mostly) Americans
Probably because they are the most likely to approach you
One time this elderly lady with a heavy texan drawl asked me where the Fortress Hohensalzburg is
I said “well, let me think“ and started staring at thw huge castle looming on a mountain above the city
When they realized what I was getting at her husband laughed
I think she was less amused
Another time an american family from Minnesota asked if they could share a table at a beergarden
We got into a conversation and the father of the group could not get over the fact that my friend lived in an apartement in the 800 year old housr next to the beergarden
He apparently believed those were all just kept for decoration
two girls (late teens) from the us were completely astonished, we have fridges in austria (i do not know what they thought we use - ice
nothing
) but they were so amazed we have fridges (and not only for shops or so, but in our houses
Two American ladies were waiting in line in front of me to get a Döner/Kebap at a kebap stand
When the kebap man told them that they only could pay with cash they angrily turned around and asked me where to get money because "in this fucking country you can't pay anything without cash".
I just entered "ATM" in Google Maps on their phone and they were amazed by that
In the same night a French girl I talked to said that she can't wait to get home again because she misses good tasting food
That hurt a little bit to be honest
There are a lot of mostly American tourists who like greeting/thanking/etc
in the language of the country theyre visiting
Like "Gooten Tawg, Id like to buy these souvenirs, Danke, Awf Viderrzeyn
The amount of tourists that get the language wrong though is quite weird
I was often greeted in French and Italian
*vaguely gestures at everywhere*
That doesn't suprise me, there are people who are super dissapointed when they come to Austria and see we actually have cars, not horse carriages, like they saw in the movies
Time for a revolution
Do you have those in your country
Our english teacher once told us when she visited  the U.S (20years ago) they wouldn't believe her we had washing machines over here
It just baffles me
well in Vienna it's not called Eiskasten for no reason
best reaction would probably be to start explaining to them how it works, pretending to think that they don't have any one home, considering they're so excited about it
I mean, we often tell Americans that they should at least learn hello/please/thanks in the local language
So you can't blame them for that
My buddy invited him to see the flat
While the guy was ecstatic and *would not stop gushing about how cool it was*, his daughter and son were mortified
Good times
Preach it, pastaboi
As somebody who works in tourism its nothing but annoying if somebody greets you in your language but doesnt speak it
Its our only hint which language this person understands so naturally if somebody says Guten Tag to me I start talking in German - only to realize a minute later that this person can only say these two words
If I could change one thing about tourists it would be that they stop doing that
That theres way less spontanious singing and dancing going on that expected just adds to the dissapointment
Still haven't seen it, and don't intend to ever do

Local language, no
A very commonly understood foreignlanguage, yes, but not a local language at all
Noted and same
Well, the French are sure something else
Usually a French talking collegue takes over
Otherwise I have below the counter the standard sentences written in French (and Italian)
97% of the time
I have a some coworkers who need switch to English for technical topics because they're immigrants and aren't as fit with our language, otherwise I very rarely speak another language
Edit: I'd also like to nominate this as "the weirdest or funniest thing a foreigner said".
Americans really know little about foreign countries/cultures

But only because I make it a point to regularly exit my filter bubble and go looking for different news outlets

Completely up to the courts to decide if something was self defense with appropriate force
But generally they will likely rule in favor of the defendant if it was defense against bodily harm
Defense of property, not always
It says that use of force is not appropriate when there is "only small damage", so you can't shoot someone who stole a few euros from you
You have a right to self defense and defending others but there is also "Excessive Self Defense" when you go beyond what is imediatly necessary to mitigate the danger to yourself or others
In the end it boils down to a case by case decission by a judge
There have been cases of a trespasser beeing shot that were found to be within the law and others of a broken nose to be beyond the right of self defense
Also, in Austria every unblemished adult person can own guns for self defence
Thats unheard of, in most European countries
It's interesting to look at cases where people defended themselves
There was a case where a guy shot and killed an intruder through a closed door
It was ruled to be appropiate self defence, because the defendant announced that he was armed and the intruder still tried to open the door
On the other hand, if you are not at home and get attacked, and you defend yourself with a knife, it's extremely unlikely that it will be declared self-defense
>I just don't fear burglars because they're after my stuff only and that's a nuisance, not a danger
Nobody should fear basic burglars, but home invasions are becoming more frequent in Europe too
> It was response to paneuropean law banning extended ammunition clips and other stuff, that has no reason to be owned by civilians
The European law banned normal sized magazines
Not "extended" ones
They claimed it was to fight islamic terrorism, but there hasn't been a single terrorist attack in Europe performed with a magazine or gun that would have been effected by that law
>which is why almost all armies reserve them for specialist units, and use semi automatic rifles with reduced propellant, called "assault rifles".
Which armies are you talking about
Almost all armies issue "select fire" rifles to general infanterists
Select fire means, you can switch between full-auto and semi-auto
Militaries generally don't use reduced propellant either
NATO loads are pretty high compared to most civilian loads
NATO militaries use the 5,56x45mm cartridge which is a "intermediate cartridge".
Switzerland, Austria and Czechia have gun culture and I don't think anything is wrong with that
But in my opinion, American gun culture has become very toxic
Yeah
Austrian and Czech gun laws are pretty liberal
I don't know any EU countries besides them that allow self defense for every citizen
I'd say theft and robbery usually
But sexual assault, murder and kidnapping are also in the realm of possibility
When the occupants are inside, the invaders can force them to tell where the valuables are or make them open the safes
I am not saying it's a common occurance, just that the rates are increasing
Still not anywhere close to American levels
The law came into effect very recently
No islamic terrorist used legal weapons, neither before or after the magazine ban
Not if there has never been that kind of attack before the law was passed, which is what I understood the comment to mean
>We kinda do, yet also don't. Here you are allowed to use a gun to defend yourself, but I don't think it's allowed to carry guns
What I meant is that, self defense is a viable reason to get a gun (for the general population)
The law here specifically says, that every unblemished adult citizen shall be issues a license for 2 guns for self defense, if they apply for one
Carrying is another license though
>So in essence if you carry an illegal firearm and use it to kill someone in self defence, you will be fined for the offence of carrying an illegal firearm, but you won't be punishment for (reasonable) use of said firearm
Yeah, thats how it works here as well
In Austria for example there hasn’t been a general magazine limit before the EU wide ban
And there has never been a crime or attack comitted with a legal magazine that has now been banned
For hunting the limit is 2+1 here
The EU ban was specifically targeted at islamist attacks, according to the lawmaker
I don't think its working and it is unnecessary
They are not going to reduce terrorist attacks or gun crime by banning magazines above a certain size
Neither terrorists nor criminals used those kind of weapons
They are not effected by the law at all
What the law accomplishes is harassment of legal gun owners, a huge strain on bureaucracy and legal confusion for all involved parties
The problem is, those magazines used to be completely free to buy  and sell
Now they became "illegal weapons" over night and suddenly you have to register every single one of them
Government agencies are overwhelmed with work, jurists and lawyers are not sure how to apply those EU laws and law abiding citizens might become criminals over night due to weird new law
And no additional security is gained
Our rural police was called Gendamerie as well until they were merged with our urban police (Polizei) in 2003 or so
They weren't a part of the military though
We had two different Polices before they were unified but none of them were Military Police
However one of them, the "Gendarmerie" Doubled as militia during the occupation time after WW2 until we were allowed again to found a "prober" Military, that showed also im the Name of the Ranks and the hirachy which was more Military like
We had a separation of police and Gendarmerie until the 2 decades ago
But the Gendarmerie was no paramilitary formation in contrast to France
Both forces were unified as police with much of the Gendarmeries tradition beeing integrated
Especially in the training of officers
In 2005 (just looked it up :))
Austria has a quite good one:
A "Grubenhund"(mine dog) is a letter to the editor written to troll newspapers into publishing nonsense
It comes from the word "Grubenhunt", which is a mine cart
It came about when an satirist got fed up by journalists writing incompetently about technical topics; he wrote to the "Neue Freie Presse" a letter which contained phrases like "variability of the pressure thickness" and "cosmic earthquakes".
A few years later an engineer picked up the idea and wrote them about an earthquake:
"I sat alone in the compressor room, when - it was exactly 10:27 - the 400 horsepowered compressor, which fed the electromotor for the steam-overheater, showed a noticeable voltage fluctuation
Totally unexplainable, on the other hand, was, that my mine dog, sleeping in the laboratory, showed signs of extreme nervousness, half an hour before
Later examples from other people included fireproof coal, square circles and the senator Duca Melbista-Berso-Thum(Du Kamel bist aber so dumm / You are a stupid camel, though)
In Austria, especially in Vienna, we call undertakers "Pompfüneberer". This is of course the butchered version of the french phrase "pompes funèbres", "great funerals" - the name one of the biggest funeral homes in Vienna around 1900
Medieval tales/epics are in general shared between the "Frankish" countries (France, Germany, Lowlands, Alps, and sometimes England, Italy, Spain)
Judging by the development over the recent years, nobody is learning even about things that happened a hundred years ago
Most historical events are glossed over, sadly, and WWII is spoken about for far too long (to the point where at least half of the students don't even care about the topic, because they feel that they are being lectured at for something that is out of their control)
I had a really great history teacher, and they spent a lot of time talking about Vienna between the bread wars and red Vienna, which was nice and really interesting, but my other history lessons often revolved around Rome, and things like this
In Austria, school starts when youre about 6 or 7 and is just mandatory until you're roughly 15 years old (9 school years) where about [1/3] start an apprenticeship and the rest continues with school until they are around 19 and then go to uni
So technically you could already work by 18
England has 11 years of compulsory education, ending at age ~16
There's then 2 years of specialising before starting university at ~18
University usually starts at 18 for women and 19 for men because of the mandatory military/civilian service
Yeah, as much as there's to critizise about our education system, we have apprenticeships pretty dialed
If i were to make a decision again (being 15 and knowing what i know now, about what kind of work i want to do) i think i'd take that route rather than the academic one
**Linz** -> The Celts first settled the place and called it *Lentia* = curve, because the Danube makes a big curve here
Then the Romans came and built a military castrum, took the Celtic name, and "latinized" it by just using a similar sounding Latin word instead, i.e. *lynx, lynces* (like the big cat)
That eventually turned in Lintz or Linz
**Vienna** (= german: Wien, Austrian dialect: Wean) is more complicated as there's two separate etymologies:
-> the first to settle here were also Celts
The name comes probably from Celtic *Vedunia* = "forest brook", and refers to the river Wien
Then it is believed that there might have been a Slavic version of this name for a while, because Slavs settled in most of modern Austria in the early Middle Ages, before German speaking Bavarian settlers arrived a few hundred years later
But the Slavic name is not known, because they didn't write a lot
Then we find the Old High German name *Wenia* in a Latin text from around the 9th century, which certainly derives from *Vedunia*. That eventually turned into *Wien* or *Wean*.
-> *Vindobona* was the name of the Roman castrum in very center of today's Vienna (right in the oldest part of the old town), but it has no known etymological links to *Wien* (or at least it's disputed)
It also derives from Celtic and means "white settlement" or "white soil" or "property of a man named Vindos", and probably originally referred to some kind of manor of a Celtic noble
*Vindobona* later changed as well, and eventually turned into *Viden/Widen/Vieden/Wieden*, which is still the Czech, Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian name for Vienna
The relation with the name of the 4th district of Vienna, *Wieden*, is disputed
*Vindobona* is still used today sometimes, e.g. in Latin texts
The University of Vienna is officially called *Alma Mater Rudolphina Vindobonensis*.
Neither of the etymologies have anything to do with wine, which is a common misconception
Fun fact: the opening scene of *Gladiator* is supposedly set close to Vindobona
Marc Aurel actually came here
From my birth town it's Bear's creek, but nobody is sure if it's named after literally a bear or an noble named Pero (which is old high German for bear)
Graz where I lived for a Long Time comes from Gradec, has slavic Origin and is the dimutiv of Castle, so it's little Castle
Salzburg - directly translated it means "Salt Castle", the name stems from the salt trading and manufacturing in the region
This took place in the time when the former roman city of Iuvavum was refounded (696 A. D.) as Salzburg around 200 years after the collapse of the roman empire
Kirchberg am Wechsel
Well first part translates to Churchhill cause there is literally a church on a hill
Second part means "at the Change" where the "Change" (Wechsel) is a mountain that is known for his quickly changing weather conditions
At least that's what my grandpa told me :)
As a life-long Wiener I learned a lot from your post, thank you
In my experience, people from Copenhagen do this
People from Jutland not so much
We say that "Katzen schnurren" (Cats purr), but we don't have a word or sound for the purring itself, as far as I'm aware of
It's the same in Austria
I actually don't even know which university has the best reputation for my studies
That's not really something people care about
Also the private universities have a reputation of buying yourself a degree when you can't make it into public university
Most studies are actually not restricted regarding the amount of students
If you want to study law or chemistry e.g. you just sign up
Only for medicine, psychology or Fachhochschulen (universities of applied sciences) you have to do an entrance exam
So I only know 2 private universities and they are for psychology and medicine
When looking for a master's I found out that we actually have a surprising amount of private universities for business studies
All of them are paid degree mills that finish with an MBA, but still, there's more than one would think
Almost every university (theoretically) has entry exams now, I had one to get into the University of Business and Economics
You usually have to sign up for the test in spring or so and it only takes place if there are enough people applying (didn't take place for law this year for example)
That cant be the reason,
We are Team Catholic since the release and we still have tons of folklore including the mentioned "Wasserman".
That cant be the reason, We are Team Catholic since the release and we still have tons of folklore including the mentioned "Wasserman".
they sitting on the rocky Islands, AFAIK they are often depicted with Eagle wings and claws
The most famous mentioning would be in Homers Odyssee
AFAIK mermaids have the same origin and they do basically the same, luring and seducing seaman to join them and then kill them
(also in 20th century paintings they are depicted as nude woman in the sea)
Any movie-plot that requires an in-country coast line
Anything involving road trips
Between high gas prices, short distances and crowded roads, they're not really a thing here, you either go by car for short distances, or you take the plane or train for longer ones (anything 3-400km+)
Connected to that, anything involving highway/freeway culture, specifically diners and mom-and-pop highway rest stops and quirky small-town sights like "biggest chicken statue of Texas". Our rest stops are all professionalised chains that serve fancy buffet style restaurant food at overly high prices (not much competition on the freeway), the equivalent to highway truck stops are probably the cafés adjacent to gas stations, but they're always sad smoky places and only good for coffee, a dry sandwich, or some greasy sausage or kebap
And even though there are local sights like some old castle or maybe a farmer's market, there's hardly any attractions with the sole purpose of attracting passers-through
Any zombie movie where people use lots of fire weapons and finde insane amounts of ammo
I wouldn't even know where to look for those
Homeless people carrying their alcohol in brown bags, or people getting pulled over and passengers having to hide that they've been drinking in the car (as long as the driver stays sober, of course)
Also people having to stay in the car and blinking into a blinding flashlight that's shining in their face, I've never experienced that here, also staying in the car is more a convenience and not a safety thing
Anything involving real estate agents and selling and buying houses, and families moving cross-country for work
It's not as prevalent here, people are more connected to their hometowns and families, and most people stay in one place, especially when they have kids (there's always exceptions of course)
And estate agents are never of the "driven soccer mum" type here, they're all of the "sleazy car salesmen" variety instead
Criminals fleeing across state borders; police not having jurisdiction across community borders; sheriffs protecting "their" town
Normal police is all federal police here
Also, people trying to get away from somebody by buying a car in cash, and just getting in and driving away
You'd have to go and get it registered before you can drive it here
In generall, less of a "just go and do" attitude here, everything needs some kind of permit and sign-up and two weeks of application procedures here; examples include going fishing (need a permit and take an exam for that), buying a car, opening a business
People being on federal land, and also people being chased from rural private properties by shotgun-weilding grandpas
All land is owned by *somebody* here, but in return we get to enter the uninhabited parts that are used for agriculture/forestry, as long as we don't damage anything
And getting a weapon pointed at you like that would be enough reason to get the police involved, and the pointer getting in trouble, even when it's on their property
Anything involving university campuses, campus police, frat life or high school or university sports teams
Over here, university works more like a government office, you go there to get your education, but you wouldn't want to spend any of your free time there
Also no sports facilities and teams, and no "XY university" sweaters
Deparment buildings can be located all over the city, there's no one big campus
And since students are not all in one big pile, parties are not as "mardi-gras style" insane
You *can* see that type of partying on music festivals here though, and on alcohol-fueled all-inclusive trips that recent high school graduates go on
Because I just saw Stranger Things S03: Anything involving fathers getting upset about their teenage daughters dating, or parents not allowing boy-/girlfriends to stay over and being intimate
And people assuming that high schoolers don't have sex
That's all not a thing here
Any wedding drama
Doesn't mean people don't celebrate it, but it's not such a big deal here: normally there's no engagement rings, there's not such a big divide between genders where the guy has to "prove" his love by buying something expensive, girls don't assume that this day has to be the best day of their life, bridesmaids and groomsmen are just your friends coming over and celebrating with you but their clothes don't have to match, and even though stag nights are a thing, that's kind of a lower social class thing here
In total, less preparation, more just spending a nice evening with your friends and family
Anything involving strip clubs as places to go to and hang out in
I mean I'm sure they do exist, but I guess they're mostly along the border to Eastern European countries, and I imagine them to be smoky and sad places and closely linked to prostitution, and not something that you'd just go to with the guys to be manly
Definitely a place though to meet up with the local crime scene, as it's also sometimes depicted
Anything involving country bumpkin incest stereotypes
Rural areas, while sometimes poorer and less developed, are never *that* far off from civilization, what we see as "out in the sticks" is always at most one or two hours by car from the state capital
Also some rural areas are quite wealthy due to tourism
People are more conservative than in cities though, that's the same
Breaking Bad:

I always wondered why they don't just walk to the next town
Don't get me started on that goddamn Austrian gas station
Can confirm
We teachers have to be really civil to students lest we be fired
Where do you live
It just would be like game of thrones, but only the parts north of the wall
You can get a country flair on the right
Obviously not
But your voter's notifcation card does
It works easily for Austrian dialects to switch to Austrian Hochdeutsch
Although it is more challenging for people from Vorarlberg, especially older ones
Their dialect is more related so Swiss German than the rest of Austria where the dialects are related to Bavarian
Austrians understand each other if they try to speak hochdeutsch
It could be more challenging for non German natives or for Germans the further north you come
There are some words or sayings that are only common in Austria
If you learn German as a secondary language, you will probably learn a standard Germany German
So someone from Austria could seem similar to what you described in Manchester
Younger Austrians are usually more adapted to standard German through media and it is more enforced in schools nowadays
My parents had their non language subjects teached in dialect and that is not common anymore
In Austria, we will usually switch to standard-German
We don't like it, though
It's really awkward to us
And we are very thankful for it :) I love the Scots Dialekt but if you talk too fast I am doomed
I’m from the south of Austria and i didn’t understand a word of anything when a Swiss person talks to me in Swiss German
To me its like a completely different languages
When I went to Switzerland I realized that their TV moderators, radio moderators etc all spoke Swiss German, whereas in Austria they‘d speak a kind of „High Standard Austrian German“ but not in dialect
So I think media plays much of a role here- I‘ve also realized that children/teenagers in Vienna these days talk in a veeeeery high German manner, like they‘re straight out of Hamburg
I don‘t know where they picked that up, but I guess social media
Austrian German (our standard language) isn't declining at all
Austrian dialects are declining
I was startled by this, too
It was at the supermarket and these just-turned-teenagers spoke more with a German German dialect than Austrian German
So I gave it a thought and it must have something to do with all those German YTers and streamers
Absolutely annoying, if you ask me
I wanted to slap that kid right then and there
Don't know what to say I have a considerably younger sister and she speaks way more "high" German than me
I always thought it has to do with the German TV channels etc
Even grammar differs
Eg " I hab einen Einser bekommen"  and she says " Ich habe eine Eins bekommen"....
Haha thank you
Every time I complain about that to my friends or family most of them tell me it‘s not that bad but ffs it just ain‘t the way we speak here
Ois Piefkegschroppn
[Gebrüder Marx - Piefkegschropp]
Aaah finally, a song about my deep dark fear
Although I personally speak a mixture between dialect and Standard Austrian (depending on who I‘m talking to), the thought of having children that speak like Germans is so hoat meier
Buying and selling cars within EU should be easier
It's just a pain in the ass when I want to buy a car from Bavaria (100km) from me, to get all the paperwork, different taxes, import regulations etc
Cars a a lot cheaper in Germany than in Austria because of the bigger market, but with all the additional costs it will be about the same
It just seems a bit weird, everything in the EU is free market etc
but when it comes to cars you have to buy it in your country ....
The method for billing highway tolls
Even if we allow that some countries have tolls and others don't and some have them for some highways only, and the prices will be different too, there should be a uniform electronic system for billing
And let's not even think about parking meters, they are not even standardized within each country
Crazy
SCHUKO everything
I'm quite sure that God wanted paper to be red
yes, for when you have to exit your car in dangerous spots like a highway so you don't get hit by nearing traffic
also that's why the French "yellow vest" demonstrations (that was about fuel taxes in the very beginning) used those, they were readily available and a  symbol for motorists
Because it's butt ugly while offering only negligable security benefits
Schuko ftw
**Marillenknödel (Apricot dumplings)**
Made with either potato or Topfen (idk the english word)  dough
They are then rolled in crispy fried sweet bread crumbs
They can also be filled with plums
**Potato/Bread dumplings filled with:**
- Surspeck, Idk how to translate it, but it's [basically bacon with >90% fat]
- Grammeln, greaves
They are made by cooking bacon (like the one above) in water until the water has evaporated, then they are heated until most of the fat has melted and the remains are fried until they are golden brown
- Bratknödel, filled with minced cooked beef and pork, however there are several different variants, that's just how my grandmother made them
**Germködel**
A fluffy yeasty dough filled with "[Powidlmarmelade] plum jam
The dumplings are steamed instead of cooked and served with a shitton of butter and poppy seeds mixed with powdered sugar
It's a traditional meal after skiing
**Leberknödel (Liverdumplings)**
Minced beef liver mixed with bread crumbs and spices
They are then baked and served in beef broth
Although not a filled dumpling like you asked I just wanted to include them
We have many different dishes that would fit, but I'm gonna use this opportunityto talk about one from my region that is pretty unknown in the rest of the country: [Schlipfkrapfen]
They're made with pasta dough and filled with mashed potatoes, garlick, and other spices
Boiled in salt water and served with grated cheese, chopped chives, and melted butter
You can also roast them with or without eggs
Edit: [Kärntner Kasnudeln] are similar, but filled with quark
They're definitely inferior tho
These are insanely delicious
They are really popular in Austria too - Zwetschkenknödel
Kärntner Kasnudeln
Germknödel
My eternal enemy
I hate that stuff with a passion
It's the only food where I would stand up and leave if you eat one next to me
I cannot even stand the smell
I know others love them, but to me they are totally gross
In general we have many different kind of dumplings in Austria though
Not only the ones you mentioned but of course also: Hascheeknödel (dumpling filled with ground sausage leftovers), Speckknödel (filled with Speck/Ham), Grammelknödel (what is Grammel in english
), normal Semmelknödel (made from bread), Tyrolean Speckknödel (same as Semmelknödel, with added Speck), Kartoffelknödel (made from potatos) and I am sure there are many more
I think we Austrians just love our Knödel
I'd say your special dumplings are those bohemian dumplings that get served to svickova
How dare you say Kasnudeln are inferior
I think you're the first person I've seen who doens't like Germnknödel
I forgot to mention that there a many different regional variants, I just listed the ones I eat most of the time
However I did mention Speck und Grammelknödel
AFAIK dumpling bread and potato dumpling originate in Austria/Bavaria/Czechia
Traditionally they are served without vanilla sauce, but it's often added
I'm sorry, I don't speak wrong
vanilla sauce more common with Buchteln
Whether Kaiserschmarrn is a full meal or just desert
People who put jam/nutella on whole grain bread vs people who put it only on white bread
Raisin buns are much better
Such chocolate buns aren't very good
Krapfen is the only correct word
>Puntigamer vs
Gösser
a classic "Pest oder Cholera" situation
Tomate and Kartoffel are German and not Austrian words in my opinion
I think one could also add beer vs
wine for Austria
But that would basically just be East vs
West
I dont think I ever met an Austrian who eats it for desert, for me this is a tourist only thing
I am sad that they seem to exist
I had this discussion very recently with colleagues in the university cantine
They complained about the lack of main dish and how Kaiserschmarrn alone would not make them full
I was utterly confused
Du los mei Pitti
Viennese beer (Ottakringer) is utter shite tho haha
That's not true at all :) they massively improved in the last years imo
Both of them are worse than Ottakringer in my opinion
Open the beer with another beer
Then open the second beer with the cap of the open beer
The Netherlands
My boyfriend and I went on a roadtrip to the Netherlands a few years ago and we loved every second of it
I understand that going on holiday and actually living somewhere are two completely different things, but still
I love the language, the general "feeling" of the country, how friendly everyone we talked to was, the landscape, etc
I'd love to go back again once the pandemic is over
Right now I have 4 crushes
My first one is Switzerland
Landscape wise it's basically Austria on steroids
Since more than a year I have been trying to find places in Austria that match those of our western neighbor
It's a hard race haha
So Switzerland is an envy-crush for me
Next one is Netherlands
I just love how organized everything looks there
As if one person sat down in the early 2000s and planned every centimeter of the country
My third one is the Czech Republic
I have also never been there but I do the same as you
I roam the streets on street view and I read into history and places
The crazy thing is that I study 40 mins away from the border
But due to Covid I can't visit our neighbor
This makes me  want the country even more
My last and biggest crush is Germany
I literally have feelings for this country
Not love but nostalgia
It reminds me of my childhood
As a kid I consumed a lot of German media and kids shows
The cities, the places and the technology (like Bagger 288) have always fascinated me
German cities have an amazing flair/vibe and I am sure I want to live for some years in a German city
The only thing we are missing in Austria is the sea
That why enjoyed Nice so much
You sure have many beautiful cities in your country
Also the quality of your food is amazing
Nice a favorite country of mine writes positive stuff about a favorite country of mine
And that's why we shall recreate the Empire to take back what rightfully belongs together
Pula here we come
Definitely do that ;)
I also hope to visit your wonderful country again soon my friend, had nice times there
You're always welcome here mate
Depends a lot on the countries
;-)
German:
Kopf und Schulter, Knie und Fuß, Knie und Fuß.
Kopf und Schulter, Knie und Fuß, Knie und Fuß.
Und Augen, Ohren, Nase, Mund
Kopf und Schulter, Knie und Fuß, Knie und Fuß.
I also never heard it in German
I googled it out of curiosity because of this post and found this text
Same
This one of the first songs we learned for our English classes, along with the other classic "If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands".
It is common to sing the English version however
I do remember singing it in kindergarten
Kurt Waldheim were once Secretary-General of the UN and became a persona non grata in the eyes of USA and Israel during his Austrian presidency
Only because he forgot to mention he served for the SA and may or may not participated in some war crimes
Prob Haider or Strache
-Engelbert Dolfuß
Our first fascist Leader
-Adolf Hitler
Our second fascist Leader
-Jörg Haider
Some fascist who wanted to get into power but drank to much and died in a car accident
-HC Strache
Some other fascist who got all the fans of the 3 guys mentioned before
He and his party just nuked the government coalition
A video (they didn't know they were filming it) showed him trying to sell our country to Russia
Also the video showed some coke, and him acting like low life drinking and smoking
Depends: alive or dead
Alive: Heinz-Christian Strache
Former Vice chancellor and ex-member of our far right freedom party
In June, a video was leaked that shows him basically trying to get a Russian oligarchs niece to buy our largest newspaper to advertise them
He also explains how to smuggle too high donation past the regulations and mentions multiple other people who have done so, including some of austrias most wealthy industrials
Dead:
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Basically our Basti and the one for whom you need obly his initials: H.C.
H.C. was vice chancellor up until a couple months ago, when it was found out that he tried to "sell" the country to a "niece" of a russian oligarch
The meeting was recorded (they were obviously tipsy and there was reportetly coke on the table) and leaked
H.C. was impeached (I guess you'd call it) and new elections were held in September
The problem with Basti is that he's shacking up with the right wingers, who H.C. was a part of
Also he's part of the conservative party, wich is also disliked by many
Now we'll see if we'll have a blue(right wingers)/turqoise or green/turquoise government
ImmEverybody in here should know him
Well who could that be ...
Actually he even denied it
We definitely count that one for our most disgraceful too
And the ÖVP denied it as well
With the argument that its a Jewish plot against the guy
So it's really just the same conspiracies from the övp today as it was back then
Silberstein
It was more still lingering Nazi antisemitism and having ex Nazis in the party
Yeah it was the whole "yeah just stop talking about the past" which this party still employs when their crimes from a few years ago come up so
yeah nothing has changed then
I personally often call the ÖVP  by their old CS name
Never forget who first ended democracy in Austria
Can we actually list Kurz here
Destroyed two governments in less than 24 months, and is the first person to be mistrusted enough to get thrown out as a chancellor
Of course he doesn't fit with the mass murderes from the top comments here however
He's just as is a disgrace for our country
Wait 5 years
I'd hope the country wises up before then
If he cons himself through another election he's probably going to get 45% and we are truly fucked
Kurz will sizzle out like Haider and Schüssel
Hes first and foremost a Machtmensch with no greater ambition than maintaining power
As soon as the facade he needs to maintain his popularity begins to show cracks hell lose popularity again
We all know that the ÖVP has no clue and no ambition to fix the fundamental issues of Austrian society and that it has like the FPÖ big problems with cronyism, dirty deals and (better hidden) corruption
But as soon as they slip all comes crashing down
I believe Kurz has hit a high as of now that he's not going to top
If he now panders to the left he will lose the voters of the far right that he has cultivated but If he moves even further to the far right the moderates are going to jump ship to the Neos
ÖVP dying to the Neos would be hilarious, I have to admit
At least the övp still pretends to have social ambitions
>	Her rent is slightly lower, but she lives in a small apartment (and has a deal that isn’t available to the average person), and I live in (by European standards) a medium sized house
But you live in Arizona which is one of the cheaper states to live in
I live for a while in NOVA near DC and the place I have now in Vienna is much cheaper if I would rent for approximately the same size
It’s a bit hard to compare if you don’t tell us where she lives
>	She gets about 1 week more vacation per year than I do
Then you are lucky
I didn’t have many colleagues in the US that had 4 weeks of holidays
> I work 40 hours per week, she works about 45
>	I work 40 hours per week, she works about 45
That sounds a bit weird - the normal work time allowed by law in Germany is 48 hours - yes
But most companies have work weeks with 37
5 or 40 hours nowadays - especially in the better paid fields
>	I own a car, she doesn’t. I could bicycle and use public transport to get around, but I don’t like to
She exclusively uses public transport
I could own a car in Vienna - but what for ? It would cost me around 300-400€ a month to own a decent one and I would use it only to go to work - being a public commute down from 45 minutes down to 35 minutes
>	I could bicycle and use public transport to get around, but I don’t like to
Once again you seem to be incredibly lucky - when I lived in Virginia I could literally go nowhere without a car - work was too far, shopping mall was too far, and the suburb my company put me in had no other option for shopping then that
>	I pay nothing for healthcare (covered by employer), neither does she (covered by the German taxpayer)
First - it’s covered by her employer too since the social security payments the company pays are exactly for that
But minor details
The big difference is (and that’s the game changer in my opinion) if you loose your job, you loose your insurance - if she becomes unemployed she still has insurance
This comes with so much peace of mind in difficult times
>	another major difference - SPACE
There is just more room here
My shower is made to hold a whole grown human
Hers seems to be designed for oompa-loompas
It’s the same on the road, at the store, at work
There is just so much less space where she is
No there are just more people where she is - especially in comparison with arizona
I have friends who live in Boston and New York and their places are tiny compared to what I have in Vienna and I would pay about 1/4th of what they pay if I would rent
> If you say for example you have to drive 5 miles a day that means nothing to us
And you think 5 miles a days is a big journey in Europe or what
lol
Rural areas exist in Europe too, you know
Just look for pics of US grocery stores
They have everything we have times 5(?)
Like 10 different types of milk, 200 different types of cereal, etc etc
Take the variety of products all across europe ant put it in one store - you just creates an american grocery store
I remember looking for salt and there was like two meters of aisle full of different types of salt, I just wanted simple salt damint
I‘m sure most mothers could be this „tough“ if they had to
But luckily they don‘t have to in Germany and Austria e. g.
As kids we played rock, paper, scissors, well
We just added the well but did not drop the rock
We have two different games
Rock paper scissors and Schnick Schnack Schnuck
Schnick Schnack Schnuck is basically the same but it has everything, from the normal rock, paper and scissors to towel, big rock, big paper, big towel, hole in the ground, big hole in the ground, laser gun(s), black hole and supernova
The discussion on what beats what was always fun, but somehow most of the time everybody knew what beat what (the discussion still happened lol)
PS: Idk if that was only for my school and my town or for the whole country in my childhood
(Now I barely hear Schnick Schnack Schnuck anyway)
I only knew it used from the annoying Kidw ho always wants to win, as it's the only thing which beats two other things
Naturally He didn't declare it's legal to use it beforehand
But then paper also wins against two things, so it's kinda even
Still annoying though haha
We just say „Schere, Stein, Papier“ (Scissors, Rock, Paper -the order of the words is different here)
If you add a well, paper also beats two things --> rock and well
So it's actually evened out, but I still prefer the version without well
Yeah, didn't thought in that way, but scissors still Beats only Paper and  Rock only scissors
you need an odd Number of things to choose of to be fair
Yeah that's why Rock Papier scissors Spock lizard works, but it gets complicated
Yeah, but replacing Rock with Well doesn't add something to the Game, so why should you so it for other than flavour
It's a mix of things from historical reasons to recent political decisions
The historical background of Southern Europe is a late or non-existent phase of industrialisation
The reasons for this are different for each of the south European nations
**Historical Background**
For example Spain is thought to have declined because the abundance of silver and gold from their colonies made it cheaper to buy a lot of "high tech" goods from England and Holland
Craftsmanship in these countries improved and made it possible to accumulate a capital stock to be used during the industrial revolution
Spain's craftsmen class on the other hand declined
Spain basically suffered from success
Portugal on the other hand had the issue that they were forced to sign a free trade agreement with England in the 18th century
Portugal had a thriving cloth industry during that time but the Portuguese Empire was in decline during this time
Their golden goose of Brasil, their biggest and most important colony became independent and they were at risk of being annexed by Spain
Thus they had to increasingly lean on Britain to survive as a country
The perfidious Albion exploited this by forcing a free trade agreement that included cloth on Portugal
While Portugal had a thriving cloth industry their cloth wasn't as cheap and good as English cloth and with no protections and support from this competition the industry completely declined and Portugal was thus unable to create an industrial base
(Edit: A famous thought experiment about comparative advantage came from this when the famous economist David Ricardo used the example of Portuguese wine and English cloth to advocate for free trade
That this deal was highly unequal with very different benefits should not be forgotten, it has implications to this day
Southern Italy was and is shaped by its plantation economy and its history as a foreign cash cow
Plantation agriculture on good soil in mild climate has historically been a very profitable business
Sicily for example was a bread basket of the Roman Empire and even 1200 years later Aragon, then Spain, exploited its Italian holdings fully
By the time Italy was unified in 1870 North Italy had industrialised while the South was still stuck in an agricultural economy
As agriculture mechanised more and more people went north to find work
Lastly Greece only became independent in the 18th century and even then it was a rump state largely reliant on Great Britain and other European powers to survive
Centuries under Ottoman rule weren't kind to the region as the Ottoman's rule was extractive instead of transformative
There wasn't a large burgher class nor were there any really big cities beside Thessalonica, which wasn't conquered until the 1890s. Athens at the time of Greek independence in 1830 had 4000 population
Half of the ten million people of Greece nowadays live there and it should not surprise that the city is the focal point of the modern economy
**Modern Times**
What all four countries/regions have in common is that from the 70s on credit became cheap for these governments
Portugal, Spain and Greece all became democracies and joined the EU making it an attractive investment
Politicians in these countries then used the cheap money to plaster over structural deficiencies with deficit spending
When interest increased too high a lot of times Italy for example devalued its currency
The interest rates only decreased more when the Euro was created
Credit became unbelievably cheap and fuelled spending habits even more
Add to that a housing bubble and you have a dangerous mix
That's not to say that there were no attempts to alleviate the situation
Under the Franco regime Catalonia became the economic powerhouse of Spain and Italy tried for decades to industrialise the South
In Italy however subsidies resulted in an insular economy as  Northern firms simply constructed and operated works which got their resources from the north and which sent their products to the north for further processing
When subsidies ran out these factories often simply closed up shop and moved elsewhere
**The crises of 2008 and Austerity**
When the Great Recession started in 2008 the whole house of cards began to crumble
As the crises spread interest rates for for the PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain) began to rise but through the Euro these countries had no way of helping their economy by for example devaluing their currency
2010 was a time in which state bankruptcy of all PIGS was feared and discussed
Greece especially was in a bad position
What then happened can only be described as an overreaction from Germany and other Northern states
All PIGS countries were forced to endure harsh austerity measures
This is nowadays considered a huge mistake as the austerity measures prolonged the crises and solidified unemployment as government investment was needed to end the crises quickly and jumpstart the economy
Nowadays one can see a lost generation of people which were never able to obtain a stable job for a decade or more
It all starts with corruption
Lots of corruption
You raise a lot of good points I, myself, have thought about (I study economics)
A transfer union is necessary for an integrated economic bloc like the Eurozone, however I (and basically every other observer of EU politics) currently finds it highly unlikely to push forward such further integration for the foreseeable future
The other option of trying to create infant industries in these countries is highly unlikely as most subsidies and contracts have to be written out EU-wide and protectionism is de jure and de facto impossible
The four principles of the EU forbid this
I personally consider the last option you speak about most realistic
The current trajectory of most Southern and Eastern European countries is to slowly bleed out of human capital until there are only a few urban regions left with wilderness around it
Spain and Portugal will suffer less because they have former colonies from which people migrate because of the shared language but Southern Italy and especially Greece will suffer
That is not to forget how Eastern Europe is the most screwed region of all
/u/LXXXVI has mentioned it in spirit but the region bleeds out of human capital in exchange for subsidies
The only way for Eastern countries to stabilise in population is to poach it from others in the region
Without Ukrainian refugees as a labour force Poland's economic growth would choke and die
PIS may want for Poles in the UK and Germany to return to the fatherland but that window may have already passed and a good proportion of those migrants may stay permanently there
The Baltic countries will probably atrophy into de facto city states as population decline will empty their countrysides and the remaining population moves to the capital or abroad
Romania and Bulgaria both suffer from the fact that a lot of emigrants are those that have not yet reproduced and if they never return both countries are stuck with bad demographics
That's not to forget that currently a whole generation is growing up being primarily cared for by their grandparents
As for the Balkans they aren't that much better off
While Slovenia can rely on other Balkan migrants Serbia for example bleeds human capital as many educated and learned professionals from craftsmen to doctors are leaving the country for Germany or other greener pastures
Unless women in these affected countries suddenly bear 3-4 children each their fate may be softened but not prevented
Spain is both Western Europe and Southern Europe, one could call the country's position South-Western in Europe
Thank you for your praise and if you want to ping someone you have to use /u/, like /u/Ragadast335
As far as I know at least in Czechia an important reason why the population decline is less of an issue is that not many people left the country in the first place and the natural decline of the population is nowadays evened out by Ukrainians
not sure about Slovakia but about those I do know is that a lot workers commute to Austria for construction jobs and other work
Austrians spend on average 325€/month on food
How about your country
> on average 325€/month
Man some people must live really cheap, because sometimes it feels like I spend this in a week
Since my work has quite cheap but good food for very little (€3-4/meal) I get away with spending less than €150/month
However, I usually don't eat breakfast, so it's mostly just dinner (I usually just a "Jause" instead of a full-blown meal) and Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays
560€ total, so only 140€ per person
That would seem very low
idk, 325€ seems about right for when I lived in Austria, but I'm surprised how many people from similarly priced countries spent only like 150€/month or something like that
Well in my last job I went to lunch every day, so make that 10€ per day for that alone (so about 200+€ per month)
Then I got two fixed appointments per week that come to at least another 100€ per month (10-15€ per night in drinks), Leaves me 25€ which is barely enough to get pizza delivered twice
So at least in my last job I'd hit 500€ a month easily, and that's without going out for fancy dinners
Just the drinks at my farewell party for the team were like 250€ or so
[George W. Bush thanked then Australian prime minister John Howard for visiting the Austrian troops in Iraq
Putin recently made fun of this, when he said, that it's hard to talk seriously to people who confuse Austria with Australia
\*looks what trump might have said about Austria*
Man, i cant find it but i am halfway sure that some south korean Politican on visit, said something like “Germany should consider itself lucky that it doesnt have to endure the pain of a divided nation“ in front of the Bundestag
That was before the unifcation
[... there are kangaroos in Austria]
Doesnt matter, we are used to it
I mean technically Poland was independent, although heavily influenced and controlled by the SU
He has the best words
But it makes more sense for Germany (or Austria, dont worry) than the Netherlands
I mean its stupid anyway but he clearly didnt knew about netherlands history while saying this
Generally yes, but only if those people meet the same obligations as my countries inhabitants (e.g. conscription)
My brother lives outside Austria and has the citizenship of the country he resides in and Austria
He is not allowed to vote but also doesn’t have to spend 6 months in the Army like other male citizens
If he were to be allowed to vote, in my opinion, he also should have to join the Army
After long residence in the country yes
People shouldn't have to go through all the hassles of getting citizenship, especially here where you can't get ours without giving up your previous one
Yes of course
In Vienna more than 30% of the population can't vote in their state/local elections because they are not citizens
That's a huge democratic deficit
Everybody interested in this topic should check out [Voters without Borders] , this is a european citizens initiative calling for full political equality of EU citizens using their freedom of movement
Noticed the same trend
Then they should become citizens
Just a little heads up: EU citizens can vote on a local level *everywhere* in the EU, if they have their permanent residence there
It's an EU law
And force them throw away their current citizenship
Not good
In a united Europe and a globalised world it only makes sense to allow multiple citizenships
As long as that's not the case: allow them to vote
Not very
In former eastern block countries you used to be able to get by with German and Russian but with younger people it's just English
Recently went to Norway and actually quite a lot of people spoke German and even at a museum the descriptions were in Norwegian, English and German
I've had it the other way round, I hat to talk to Swiss people in English because I could NOT understand their German at all - same with some Alemannic dialect speakers within Austria
Isn't Hungarian somehow connected
Well yes that's the whole point of Schengen, isn't it
I unintentionally crossed the Austrian-Italian border by car with only an Austrian learner's permit (L17)
We only switched drivers when we saw the sign "Galleria non illuminata" and therefore noticed that were already in Italy
Because Italy doesn't allow under 18-year-olds to drive (I was 16 back then) we had to change
> Is it completely painless
By car: Depending on the country, you either have to buy a sticker to put on your windshield to use the Highway (Like in Austria and the Czech Republic) or you have to pass through a toll gate and pay to use the highway (Like in Spain or Italy)
Besides that there are no checkpoints
By train: Nothing happens at all
On the OEBB RailJet, when I crossed from the Czech Republic into Austria, the displays switched from displaying stations in Czech and German to German and English
Some trains might give an announcement the station before the border (i.e. "This is the last station in Austria")
By plane: You land, grab your luggage, and leave
Thats it
The only other hassle that I can think of is that you might have to change currencies
> Do you need to slow down
Only if the speed limit changes from country to country, or if marked
Trains can slow down as well, but that is usually due to rail quality changing
> Are there occasional controls / roadblocks
Very rarely
It can be that a country temporarily suspends Schengen and enforces border checks, like Germany did in 2015
Random cars can be stopped as well, though this is relatively uncommon
> Is it moving in the direction of easing up or hardening
I don't know, but the EU recently allowed Croatia to join Schengen, which I presume is a good sign
> How does it affect you and other residents
Schengen allows you to do a lot of things which would be harder or even impossible to do in other countries, like
Work in country a and live in country b, as living in country b is cheaper
Buy groceries in another country
Take a day trip to another country
etc
Often the only way to notice is because you get a text from your provider that says that you crossed the border
Usually when I go to Croatia the border control guy is too busy playing candy crush to even look at my face/plate
As long as you're not traveling with a vehicle that can transport a large number of people/goods you practically wont be bothered, and when you do they just ask for a passport (have no experience as a truckdriver/drug smuggler so can't talk about that part)
It's the other way around, Germans "closed" their borders to Austria due to human trafficking
Depends on which border we're talking about
In the countryside, I've crossed the border without even realising (and ended up in Hungary or Czechia) several times
On the motorway, however, it can be a real pain in the ass, especially during peak travel times
You won't hear disagreements from me
Sorry, It
Nope, borders are "open" there
Just the Germans that are controlling us

It’s not German and I’m not used to it
I’m a religious Weißbier drinker but maybe on a road trip sometime I could try it
Germans ofc
I am Austrian and many people here make fun of Burgenland, which is a state of Austria
Germany, obviously
Sonetimes the Netherlands because if the tourists
Wait
you guys are only joking
I wouldn't say that
The typical 'neighbour joke" in Austria is usually about the next state, not another country
Like Carinthians have the Styrian jokes for example
The hard-on for German jokes on /r/Austria and /r/aeiou are mostly just a Reddit thing
I mean Austria is probably one of the most irrelevant neighbours for Germany after all
Yeah, the tings we say about germans aren't a joke
>I mean Austria is probably one of the most irrelevant neighbours for Germany after all
Are you drunk
Bavarian economy has a shit ton to do with Austria but ok m8
Is it still a joke even if it's true
I mean, we did make a movie called Piefke Saga and called it "satire"
> Or not joking but generally thinking that something Austrian is German
Oh you pesky Prussians :P
>Are you drunk
Unfortunetaly not
Dunno, I live in Eastern Austria and we never interact with Bavarians at all, so there's that
Can confirm, our diaspora is a whole lot different compared to that of Western Austria
Less Germans, more Eastern Europeans
We Eastern Austrians don't really have mountains, and I wouldn't say we are culturally closer to Germans than to Czechs here, so there's that
>the food is like German Food
Now that's the worst insult I've heard in my life
And last time I checked, Bratislava was not a part of Czechia :P
>I was in Vienna a few weeks ago, your bread is like German bread, the food is like German food, the beer tastes like German beer and your towns look like German towns
Well I could say basically the same about my visits to Prague (besides linguistics of course)
>You just don't wanna acknowledge the fact that the idea of Austrians not being Germans was fabricated in the last 100 years
Our nationality being an artificial one doesn't change the fact that only the worst kind of right-extremists would still consider us German
(Hope I didn't sound like I dislike Germany either; it's one of my favourite countries for travelling, but I can't say I feel all too close to it
But then again I don't really feel close to the Alpine Austrians either)
>Point was, 40km to the east seems like a bigger change than 1000 km to the northwest

Thermostat in my apartment is always set to 23° but I think it's off, feels more like 21-22°.
Under 20° would be cold to me
Except in the bedroom, I like thick comfy blankets so I keep it at 18-19°.
19° - 20°, that's comfortable for me
At night, 17°. 15° and below would be cold, if I'm not moving around
23°C below that and the madame gets cold feet and conversations tend to get monotopical until I readjust the setting
Sweatpants and t-shirt usually these days
They don’t want to, like Switzerland
Is the fact that you have to follow EU rules without having a say in it not a big deal for you
Because thats the tradeoff for it and you still pay into EU budget as far as i know, but i dont know if you would pay more as a member
Is there any kind of discussion about it or people people complaining about it
Hard to find anything in in English about it, when i look for it, I only find stuff about how the British would feel about a deal like that
Scandinavians and making up "trendy" new words for universal everyday concepts, name a more iconic duo
We have a word if you feel shame for somebody else - it's called "Fremdschämen"

No, why
The German use "Handy" as a word for "cell phone" is a [pseudo-anglicism] completely unrelated

Sure there are some areas where the drunks hang out and whatnot but Vienna is as safe as can be
Vienna: Totally fine in every part of the city
There's one or two spots close to party areas that I know can be filled with drunk and rowdy people at certain times at night (Stadtbahnbögen, Bermudadreieck), wouldn't want to be among them if I can avoid it but more for convenience considerations (loud, obnoxious) than for those of safety
Same during the day, there's a few spots (Bim-Station Westbahnhof, Praterstern, Gumpendorfer Straße) where drunks/crazy guys hang out and it's dirty, but it doesn't feel unsafe, just annoying
There's also spots with high percentage of immigrants (Reumannplatz, Brunnengasse) and those can feel busy/dirty in their own kind of way, but are completely safe day and night
(guy in his 30s for reference)
I only had one scary encounter in Vienna but that was in the city's poorest district
Other than that I've never had a bad experience and neither did my friends as far as I know
Very
I see older women (60+) walking by themselves at past 23:00
I’m a woman who lives in Vienna
I’ve never felt unsafe being out and about alone at night, but obviously I always keep an eye out for suspicious people nonetheless
~290k, have always felt very safe when walking late in the evening or at night, everywhere
There are some parks where the drug dealers hang out, which can feel a bit unpleasant sometimes, but it's not like they're interested in anything than selling their stuff, so
It's as safe a city as any
Wow, I realized I'm totally new to the concept of mugging
Does it normally happen at gunpoint, or with a knife
Or is it just the implied violence that makes victims cooperate
And are there normally more than one muggers, if there's any "standard" way of mugging that is
Oh and finally, would it make sense to carry decoy wallets with less cash/cards in them
When I try to get home fast at night, some women are still afraid and tend to speed up although it's in the 6th district which is kind of upper class
Seconded
Never had any problems, and I used to live in  generally "not so nice" area and I never had any problems walking Home
This
I grew up in Aschaffenburg and there walking through the city at night was no issue at all
Frankfurt was definitely scary though
Yea that's still rather common unfortunately
If you can just change to the other side of the street or something like that
Makes them feel safer, for basically no effort on your side
I wish it wasn't necessary though
Very sorry to hear that
Yes, that's something I try to do, but it usually takes me to long to realise, that she is almost running because of me
What I saw being mentioned in one of those threads where girls were replying on how to deal with this is to take out your phone and pretending to be on a call
For some reason it's way less threatening if you know the person is occupied/minding their own business/not being sneaky
Haven't tried it yet (because pretending to be on a call is awkward as hell, haha), but might give it a go if I'm in that situation and need to call somebody anyway
I would say traditional music bands often have a Hammered dulcimer and a Zither
I'd say the [Zither] :) You might have heard the [Harry Lime theme] from The Third Man
Quintessential Vienna, it features a lot in the city's own musical genre Wiener Lied, but also in Alpine song
I once watched a BBC production where they used that melody to introduce the Rhineland and I was utterly outraged and finally understood cultural appropriation - it's not German goddammit
Another Alpine instrument is the Hackbrett, but Styrian Accordion, Violas and Guitars also feature a lot in traditional music
I like to picture the Alphorn as some sort of Swiss didgeridoo, it makes both instruments infinitely more funny (maybe it's just because i'm easily entertained)
Don't forget the most amazing instrument, the [Txalaparta]
That's a very viennese thing to say
For me it would definitely be either the Sterische Harmonika or the Hackbrett
Fun fact, the modern harmonica/akkordeon/squeezebox was invented in Vienna (Cyrill Demian had the first patent in 1829), and made it's glorious and incredibly rapid spread all over Europe and into the New World (including the folk music of the southern US and Argentinian tango music) from there
It's really fascinating how this instrument is considered "typical" in so many different places
France, the Basque country, Argentina, Russia, Hungary, the Balkans, the whole North Sea region, the whole Alpine region, among Ashkenazi Jews, among Romani, in the American Deep South etc
It is
It's on the border to Slovenia but Styria is also a historical region, the border wasn't always as it is today
I'm not actually Viennese :) My very countryside dad plays Zither and Bratsche, so those are naturally the first folk instruments I thought of
Sounds familiar :)
Probably the Sieges of Vienna by the Ottomans (plural because they tried two times)
I think it was kind of important in Europe history generally, because it would have made a difference if the Ottomans were able to control Vienna as it was a important city that time
I grew up and live in a small village, the most notable event would probably be the explosion of our powder magazine in 1782
Another notable thing is that our village had it's 1000th anniverary in 1930
So in 10 years we will have our 1100th anniversary
I live in a small village, so not very much has happened here
But there was this one time when during ww2, a small hall was to be built, and before the building process started, there was a ceremony
At said ceremony, the commander of the villages Wehrmacht soldiers should "bless" the upcoming building process by hitting the first of the foundament plates to be laid down with a hammer, something along the lines of "three hits for the Führer". In his enthusiasm, he hit the plate so hard that it broke apart
Of course yes, forgot to say that :)
This is Austria, good sir
Traditions are held higher than progress
Oh there are tons, so this is by far not a full list but just some examples:
* hut - (Hut = hat)
* arm - (poor ; however: **A**rm means the same as the English word)
* list - (List = trick)
* mode - (Mode = fashion)
* pole (Pole = Polish man)
* rat (Rat = advice)
* roman (Roman = novel)
* sense (Sense = scythe)
* see (See = lake)
* toll (toll = great)
* wand (Wand = wall)
We also have lots of 'false friends' between English and German, so words might ot be identic but since the pronunciation of certain words or phrases are the same it is easy to get the translation wrong
I suggest a quick google search if you want to take a look at some examples, you will find hundreds of lists
It's not an actual word in German, but thanks to the LEGO-like properties of German (compounding), "Sausage" can mean "pig-tale" (like a tale about a pig, not the hair style)
Vater means father in German, but in Spanish it's toilet bowl
Yeah, both words are also related, English gift is related to "give". And German poison is Gift, because it's something you "give" someone (without their knowledge ideally)
The original meaning (something you give) is preserved in the old-fashioned German term "Mitgift" (With-gift), which means "dowry".
Die Bart, Die
You are correct
Mentally prepare yourself that a lot of things will be different, even things you didnt expect and which are really annoying (for example costumer service here)
Dont complain to locals about it or tell them how its better in the USA, if you need to complain rhen text your friends or family about it, they will share your discomfort
Europeans will just think youre an ignorant jerk
Also, use your inside voice outside and your outside voice inside
>How can I travel to Europe without annoying the locals
Well the question itself is kinda annoying already
Europe isn't one country and in every single country you can have different regions with different cultures
It's like asking an American how to behave in Mexico
But overall: don't speak too loudly, don't tell us how everything is better in the US and don't expect customer service to crawl up your ass and you'll be fine
Source: Been here most of my life as an American
Don't stand on the left of an escalator
Don't block any exits staring at your map or your mobile phone
Respect and also:  don't go to big tourist destinations and expect deals, be disapointed when you don't get them, and complain about the local prices
(Have seen this several times from backpackers in Italy)  Also, go to the South of Spain if you want to go to the med
> Also, use your inside voice outside and your outside voice inside
This so much
Especially the "Thank you
" is very important IMO
A Trailer Park Boys reference
Well, but mainly they support the international chain that owns the hotel they're staying at, or the fastfood chains they're eating at, the airline, etc
Not much the general population profits from
It's a norm in Austria and Germany, don't know about other European countries
How wild would it be if the Pope was a shitposter
My Russian husband wanted to give me constantly money, I had to get used to that
My boyfriend is Colombian and oh my, he eats a lot of stuff that makes my poor Austrian heart crumble
Like rice cooked with pasta, or cheese with Arequipe
But thinking back to my first time drinking hot chocolate with marshmallows I had the same feeling
*Shouldn't* go together, but it does
I'd be willing to try hot chocolate with cheese
You left out the important information here: *Do you like it

Yeah, Austria is on your side here

"Europe is utopia so let's walk there"?
each and every "untranslatable expression" is like that, to be honest
yes, I might need more than one word to fully convey the meaning, but no, it *can* be translated
and no, it's not gonna be a totally alien concept to you, just mildly interesting
but who would click on that, right
US-Korean friend of mine has such a hard time getting work as a language teacher in Asia (she's mostly in ML China), even though she has extensive education on the subject and is really knowing what she's doing
People would rather hire random Caucasian people that are tall and blonde, and while their English isn't horrible, it's not at a native level either, and they definitely don't have a language teacher education
Seems what people actually want is not a good teacher, but a tall blonde clown to make your school feel cultured and worldly
this one is my favourite by far
just the perfect mix of cute and stupid
imagine you have a restaurant next to the Eiffel tower and you allow tourists to use your toilet for free - congrats, you're now running a toilet, not a restaurant
You gotta admit that's hilarious though
"Blackensippen"
You're right, I wouldn't be surprised if that happened here as well
To be honest I'd expect the opposite to happen more often though, that people don't really want to have anything to do with darker skinned people
idk where you went but in most places its really easy
tourist area (does not have to be a tourist trap, just a place that gets tourists) = pay toilet
non-tourist (meaning residential or rural) area = free toilet but rather dirty
exceptions might be made for busy train stations or areas frequented by lots of homeless folks or junkies
I honestly can't remember the last time I paid for a toilet around here or even on holiday elsewhere on the continent
anyway, I don't really get whats the big deal about paying 50 cents to keep the place clean and junkie free
I think you are a bit too far west if you exclude Hungary, but include the Dutch parts of the low countries
Vienna, in my current district, a 50sqm apartment seems to be the best you could get
A literally mansion
I bought my big House for about the half of it
Edit: at the Border of Styria and Burgenland , near a big city 400
000 is quite the Standard prize for a 120m² House
Innsbruck, Tyrol: with 400€ you can have a 40-60 sqm flat together with two roommates
Of course each one of you has to pay 400€.
Edit: Sorry didn’t see the K.
For 400K you can buy a small flat
In the city 50sqm
In Linz (the 3rd biggest city in Austria) you can get a 90-100ish m² flat in nice condition, which is slighty more expensive than Vienna due to the freer housing market here :/
In my town I get one half of a newly built house (=shared wall with an identical half): 120 m², 5 rooms (3 bedrooms) and a smallish garden, no cellar, carport for 1 car
Or an equal sized flat with 2 garage spots, but without garden
Yay
In Austria it depends
In my area (countryside with no city nearby, touristy region) you get a flat with about 80m^2
A empty lot of like 400m² to 500m².
Or  50 - 60 m² flat depending on the quality of the flat
In my middle sized town
Northern Tirol, smaller town:
Apartment wise: - new built: a 60-70m2 two bedroom modern apartment with a garage spot and balcony/garden
- a goodcondition apartment about 10-15 years old, 2-3 bedroom, with 80-90m2
Most will have a garage spot and a balcony/garden
- an older apartment that may need some work, 3 bedroom, 90-110m2
May have a garage spot
Land: roughly 500m2 of land to build on
This is just the land, nothing else
House: pretty much nothing
If you can find a house for the price it will have very little land, be small (under 100m2), and/or need complete renovation/tear down
A nice appartment with about 80m2 if you're lucky
No houses are available in that price range though
where do you live if I may ask
a quick search and I found around 2
800 results with the parameters >50sqm and <400k€ all across the city
My brother found an 80sqm apartment for 320k. 13th district
But i have to say it was a lucky find
Maybe in Burgenland
Try to fine me something like this near Vienna or Salzburg
So 500k gets you a house but 400k only a one bedroom
yeah i reckon there are not that many areas where 400k can't at least get you 60-70sqm, unless you want some luxuries like a balcony or a garage, then you'll be passing that number fast
19th is generally considered to be a rich district (there is affordable stuff as well though), has a lot of greenspace and is on the outskirts of the city
So yeah it's pretty nice
I live in one of the inner districts, I don't want to specify exactly which one
haha then your uncle must be loaded if he‘s living there
I live in the 9th, too, and can confirm that both districts are pretty neat for living
There is some affordable stuff there too, it's not only villas and shit like that
Yeah, usually utility closet doesn't count as well
I'll give you his adress, but i'll pm it to you, i'm a cautious person
Not a "trap" per se, but the whole inner city of Vienna has become a huge luxury mall full of international brand stores you can find in ever other bigger destination, too
It's just so utterly boring
I've never been there, but this restaurant is said to be a legend in Vienna for being the pinnacle of overprized with bad food and even worse service:
You can also check out their google reviews
They even had the "honor" of getting an article in a major newspaper:
I actually thought that price per 100g was quite common for the region
However it always was directly noted with the price, not the small print
Please provide the links
I have been to Barcelona (as an incentive by my company) for (only) 3 days and instantly fell in love with that city
I know it's very touristy, but the mixture of the old part of the city, the olympic part and then the huge beach is just something very special for me
I definitely plan to go there again on my own terms after Corona
Btw, I know this is totally weird: but I really had the "luck" of getting the worst food in Barcelona
It was horrendous
I mean I KNOW you have great food, but whereever we went to, it was awful
So I need to catch up on this part massively
In German there's a type of tree cricket that's named *Weinhähnchen* (little wine cock), maybe that has the same reason ... whatever that might be
There are subs for each country and those are mainly in the native language
See /r/Austria , for example
we read and write in english
most of the european countries have to have english in their curriculum, so most of us speak it
so it isn't really a problem, there are subreddits for speficic languages or countries, like r/Austria
I’ve never had the idea to translate my posts
I want other people to tell me about my mistakes so I will get better
Just speak French and hope for everyone else to either speak it or just don't give a fuck that they don't understand you

works best for newspaper articles and the like, they're so good it's kinda scary
mostly because there still are _some_ mistakes but the rest is so good that you wouldn't look for them, since it reads *exactly as if a real person wrote it*. but at the end of the day, they're the same mistakes a human translator would make as well if he's not super careful

Jakob Schuldverschreibung - rolls off the tongue so nicely
We do have the "Parterre" or "Erdgeschoss" which is the ground floor
Some houses instead of the "Parterre" do have the "Mezzanin" which is a bit higher than the ground floor (4-5 steps)
After the Ground floor you have the 1st floor - or "Erster Stock" etc
The house I currently live in has a Parterre (ground floor, there's two shops there), Hochparterre (slightly higher ground floor, you walk up about half a level to get to the first flats), a Mezzanin (normal height, more flats) and only then there's the first floor, which I live on
The lift buttons go cellar (K) - Hochparterre (E) - Mezzanin (M) - 1 - 2 - 3
A mezzanine is pretty typical for old buildings in Vienna, Hochparterre aren't terribly uncommon either
Outside of Vienna I'd expect an Erdgeschoss and then first floor
The floor on street level is the Erdgeschoß or Parterre or Ground floor, in some buildings have a Hochparterre or Tiefparterre a ground floor that isn't actually on the level of the street (above or below)
Older buildings also tend to have a Mezzanin a kind of floor between floors, normaly an area in 19th century buildings that was often used for commercial purposes
After that you have the first floor
There is a nice book by a German born comedian who describes how he moved to Vienna
One of the little stories was that he had to carry a friend from a 3rc floor party down the staircase, which actually entailed carrying her down 6 floors
So wie es in allen zivilisierten Ländereien ist
> However if the basement is half underground (súð) then that might be considered the first floor instead of a basement
Even if you don't enter the building through that basement
Anywhere I've lived the Mezzanin was just the first floor
The few steps up I'd call Hochparterre
Bis Wien mit dem Mezzanin daherkommt
that's because Geschoß ≠ Geschoss
~~former is floor in the context of building levels; latter is projectile~~ see below
Erdgeschoß, Halbparterre, Hochparterre, Mezzanin, Erster Stock – or, as other countries would call it, fifth floor
Wenn man es nicht erster Stock nennt, ist es auch keiner
yeah
it's an Austria/Germany thing
I made a mistake though, here *both* projectile and floor are spelled and pronounced Geschoß [ɡəˈʃoːs], and in the North *both* are spelled and pronounced Geschoss [ɡəˈʃɔs]

Kind of erroneous to say the Cyrillic alphabet is from Bulgaria

[Blood types] were discovered by  [Karl Landsteiner] though
Don't goggle it
It started as a joke and now some grocery chains are selling it (allegedly)
We're born with it
However in order to activate it, you have to get a job as a bureaucratic public official
>the polio virus
Holy shit, we invented the polio virus
It always depends - the political theory ? So Marx and Engels ? I would be proud about that since this is still the base on which things like social - democracy and social reforms were based on and developed from
I wouldn’t be proud on the execution in ex soviet block states though
Well, then China
TIL
So Landsteiner discovered blood types before Janský, but only discovered three (A, B, O) and not four, which led to the American medical commission officially acknowledging Janský's discovery over Landsteiner's in 1921
It's been a running gag in Austria over the last year
A Krapfen (very similar to a Berliner), filled with jam but then also with a slice of meatloaf in the middle
It's disgusting
Ah okay
I thought you meant to write "polio vaccine". But that also makes sense
If Plague Inc
has taught me anything, then that identifying a virus is the most important step to eventually finding the vaccine
In Styria we have a community called Grossklein (bigsmall), right next to it there's a community called Kleinklein (smallsmall)
Sadly there is no place called Grossgross and I was very devastated finding it out
Lots of villages called Oed here, which directly translates to dull
In lower austria we have a very friendly thing to say about viennese:
when wiener (viennese) reallised there city is shit they started immigrating to lower austria, but lower austria didn't want them so they founded a new village, threw all wiener there and called it wiener neudorf (new viennese village), but they kept coming and soon wiener neudorf was to small so they foundad a new city, threw all viennese there and called it wiener neustadt (new viennese city)
I feel personally attacked
Lol, except "Wiener Neudorf" has existed under the name "Neudorf" for a lot longer than it has been called "Wiener Neudorf". They had to differentiate it from all the other Neudorfs when they organized the postal system
Similar story for Wiener Neustadt, it was Neustadt for several centuries before they decided the name had to become less generic
Not Quite
I think it gave all the populist parties another very good argument they can use to further their anti-EU sentiment
So basically they would create the problem and then use it as a strawman
After all, the most pro-EU Austrian parties (NEOS, die Grünen, SPÖ*) all voted against article 13 while the popultists either abstained (FPÖ) or voted in favor (ÖVP)
Not saying you're not right about your assumption, they're gonna milk this cow as much as any, but when it gets there, we should remember that
^^*voted ^^unanimously ^^against ^^except ^^one ^^representative, ^^who ^^abstained
Don't forget Article 12 (or whatever it's called now) - which takes away creators' money and gives it to publishers
>So basically they would create the problem and then use it as a strawman
Yes, that's exactly how they work
Compared to all other parties FPÖ abstains the most votes, so no surprise here
This way they don't piss off their coalition partner but they can say that they didn't vote for it and EU = bad to the voters
Win Win all the way for them
Wanna bet that when it comes to implementing the local laws we'll hear a lot of "we're so sorry, we really didn't want this, it's the big, bad EU that forces us to do this"?
Until Instagram blocks the upload of your photo of you and your spouse in front of the illuminated Eiffel Tower because apparently that needs to be licensed
Not for private citizens but the filter won't make a difference
Also, within the next 2 years EU companies that are affected directly will just move abroad and new ones won't pop up in their place because why would they
And in the end people will say "nothing has happened" and we'll never hear about it again, also mainly because major media and news outlets are to profit off the directive so they're inclined to keep it that way
I agree it won't be the end of the internet
I agree that we'll most likely not hear much about it again, although for other reasons
However I do recognise that it's a stupid bill
It's a shame Art12 didn't get more spotlight
Tells you who's behind the whole thing
Who is behind it
You have a link for me where I can read it
Besides major publishers, for example the Austrian Association of bookshops and the Association of Newspapers
Also collecting societies like the AKM or Austro Mechana are naturally in favour of it (probably less concerning Art
12)
The loudest advocate for it was arguably [Springer Science+Business Media]
It's phrased in a particular way so that if a member state says "no money for you, publisher, I want the creator to get it all", that's ok
But in a case like Germany, where courts ended the old regulation, and the legislative hasn't put a new one into law, it reintroduces the very old principle that courts had abolished
And it definitely gives publishers the argument of "look at the directive, the EU says it should be this way if we can't agree on something else
It depends how Germany implements the directive on their national level
But basically everyone who has insight into this has told me that it is indeed possible

I only know that we have that word in german because I walked past the museum for abortion and contraception
I don't think anyone does it illegally anymore
Verzweifelt ("Desperate"..... I am only joking
There is no "word" for women who need to make an illegal abortion because abortion is legal here so there are basically no illegal abortions)
Call the Midwife had an episode set in 1963 where an au pair from Hungary realises she's pregnant and is shocked she can't have an abortion
All the midwives and the doctor are appalled at the thought of legal abortions even though they know the impact all these pregnancies have on women
In a later season there's a story line where the aunt (or grandma
) of a midwife is caught performing illegal abortions and they are all beyond livid (though to be fair, those were not sanitary conditions)
So interesting that that was then only a few years from the legalisation of abortions in the UK
Has Northern Ireland finally legalised it too
I know ROI repealed the 8th a few years back, but I thought NI was still forcing their young women to seek help elsewhere
> Vienna is really interesting even while being sad, morbid and enraging
Austria in a nutshell, really
The problem is that many anti-choicers do not care
They think women who have abortions deserve to die for it
In Austria it's officially illegal EXCEPT in certain situations, such as within the first three months of pregnancy, or if there's danger to health or life of mother or child
It's still in the Strafgesetzbuch
In Austria it's technically illegal, too, but there is no punishment
It's called "Fristenlösung".
They don't give a rat's ass about the fetus, they just get a hard-on from policing women's bodies

I know everyone has heard this song on the radio 1000 times, but I still think it's an American masterpiece

Against Austria
Except you've recently made it a heck of a lot harder for yourselves
Most famous
In recent history it might be the collapse of the Reichsbrücke (Imperial bridge, located in Vienna over the Danube) in 1976
On a regular morning the entire bridge all of a sudden collapsed due to a structural failure
As disastrous as it looked, fortunately it "only" cost one man his life and the bridge was rebuild later
To make matters worse, on the exact same day in 1976, the late Niki Lauda (one of Austria's most prominent sportsman ever) had its infamous crash at Nürnburg ring
It was a rather turbulent day back then
post WW2 it would be events such as the [Kaprun disaster] or the [Galtür avalanche]
As far as i remember, not only was almost everything (including several churches) destroyed, but the red light district was largely unscathed
Wow i didn't know this was the same day
Unbelievable
Wasn't there a bus on the bridge when it collapsed that was repaired and used again
Somebody already mentioned Kaprun
Also the [Lassing mining disaster]
[Salzburger Nockerl] I grew up in Salzburg and I don't know anyone who's eaten it more than once, and many people who've never tried it at all
I have a Schnitzel maybe once or twice a year
I can't be bothered to make it at home, and there's usually something else I'll rather get when going to a restaurant
Chinese tourist groups and travel agencies often request restaurant in Vienna to serve spare ribs
They apparently think this is a typical viennese dish, but nobody here knows why
And nobody here (or anywhere else in the world) would consider spare ribs typical for Austria
There must have been a chinese movie or TV show where somebody eats spare ribs in Vienna
Fucking Baumkuchen
Same here, some countries think it's super common, I had my first one at 30+.
Can confirm, I have never tried it
But it looks delicious
I worked in a restaurant that served it
It is such a pain in the ass to make and really isn‘t all that great
Looks cool though
I tried them twice
They are good, but definitely not a must have
Had onion soup couple of times
My farts became chemical weapons two hours later
I love eel, but I never realized they were a British thing
Out of all things I found out about my country because of this subreddit, I think this one surprised me the most
Spare ribs are an american dish in my mind
This reminds me of a YouTube video about what is considered prohibited/bad/a sin in each persons country and everybody said like religious things or something similar (like sex before marriage or running around without a burka (am sorry if I miswrote that or that isn‘t true, if it isn‘t please say it)) and the italian dude just started a monologue about pineapple on pizza and other foods lol
>Germans like to eat their Schnitzel with sauce, like mushroom sauce, pepper sauce, etc
/r/SchnitzelVerbrechen
They don't. They eat Petteri instead
Don't believe the other guy
They are quite nice - like a combo of Windbäckerei and Kaiserschmarrn
And they're far easier to make than everyone says
Can confirm
Sauerkraut was a big part of my grandmothers food
Thanks for taking care of that before they get even further south
Austrians eat proper Jägerschnitzel, without breading and with mushroom sauce
Man I miss Eurovision
Is there any hope we are having one this year
You have been banned from /r/Austria
No washing/Air drying of white clothes/bed sheets between Christmas and Epiphany
I didn't knew it but appearently it has something to do with the Wild Hunt
they will curse the house If they get cought in it
The "Rauhnächte", the nights between Christmas and Epiphany are in some superstitions, they should be the time were the Realms of the spirits and the living are the closests but Most of them are neither still believed Nor widely known anymore
If you clink your glasses across the arms of two other people clinking, you'll  have ugly kids/bad luck
There are also "beliefs" on how to clink with different types of beer
Normal beer is clinked at the top of the bottle or glass, wheat bear is clinked on the bottom
In Austria you get an angry mother in law
Was zum Teufel
I'm assuming you mean at school
And by folders, do you mean those loose-leaf binders to collect printouts in
Or the plastic covers for notebooks
In both cases the answer is: mostly could be any color, and if the color was mandatory, it depended on the teacher
For main subjects (German, Math, English) we often had two homework notebooks that would be handed in in an alternating manner, in that case sometimes the color was mandated by the teacher
We had such things mandated in such a detailed manner up to maybe half or end of Middle School (= 6th-8th grade), most of the time you could have any color you want though
After those grades we stopped using notebook covers altogether I think
Loose-leaf binders (as often used for "side" subjects like Biology etc) could normally also be any color you liked (at least after elementary school (= first 4 grades)
Green: Biology, Chemistry
Red: Maths
Blue: German
Yellow: English
White: Latin
Orange: Physics
Just to name a few
Maths = Red
German = Blue
English = Green
Minor subjects = The transparent one

In Austria I would say it is the so called "Freunderlwirtschaft" which means something like "friendship economy". Most of the solid job opportunities you only get if you have a good network of contacts
You especially see this phenomenon in the public sector which is one of the biggest employees here but still they hardly write out job offers
It's all about knowing somebody who knows somebody
Of course if you have a degree in a highly requested field like computer science this does not count for you
The people
South tyrol, yes i triggered the most of italy with that but south tyrol is the only austrian region that isn't hates by any other austrian province
Probably Graz or Innsbruck
Haven't heard too much hate about them from anyone around the country
For regions, probably yes
For cities: What about Innsbruck
Does anyone hate that
What can be said is that the provinces hate Vienna and Vienna hates the provinces
Otherwise, I think Salzburg gets the least hate
Lol, so you are saying the only thing we all like is the thing we can't have
Yeah, that sounds painfully Austrian for sure
Also East Tyrol
You can't hate it, when you always forget about it
Bilbao is not the capital of the Autonomous Basque Region
Vitoria-Gasteiz is
Bilbo is the largest city though
Also: the best Spanish region is Cantabria
Miguel Ángel Revilla told me so at least
damn rich jet-set mountian dwellers showing off their sportiness wherever they go
oh I can rant about Innsbruck allright
>provinces
So I guess you are from Vienna
I'm in Vienna and I hate Vienna too ;)
Overall the whole Salzkammergut is liked I think
rich conservative sissies the damn pampered lot of them
carinthia wannabes
best dialect though, I'll hand them that
You know that north and south tyrol don't like each other, wouldn't it be obvious then that the same is the case with upper and lower austria
Upper Austria actually
But "privince" is a common deragatory term that is employed
What we can summize from this is that we Austrians don't do the like thing very well, instead Just having several Levels of dislike xD
Accurate
I do not hate this comment as much as the other comments
I was in Tromsø last winter and while I wore Longjohns under my Jeans and thick winter boots with thick socks I saw a girl walking home from school in Adidas Sneakers ankle free
But I guess you just get used to the cold if you’ve grown up there
We went past a school and it seemed like PE class was held outside (it was something like -5 or -10°)
Also: get some Touchscreen gloves
They‘re great
What is it with these exposed ankle trend that's been going on for a few years
I mean it's totally fine during the rest of the year but when it's winter that looks just stupid, like these people don't know how to properly dress themselves
Just a lowly sysadmin writing scripts for infrastructure automation, but always English for me
English of course, I'm not a monster (also our coding standard and common sense demand it)
Either that, or emojis
I code in English, comment in English and if possible document in English too
The only exception is that I know no good translation of the word "Datenträger", so I use that as a loanword in code (as "datentraeger")
>Geraeuscheemmision
It's Geraeuschemission tho
See, that's the difference between Austrian and Swiss German ;)
Am I being whooshed
It's wrong in Swiss German too
It isn't in the marketing department because they don't know basic spelling
Among the 3 discounters in our country, which are Lidl, Hofer (Aldi Süd) and Penny, I'd say Hofer is clear nr 1, followed by Lidl and Penny
&#x200B;
The bread & stuff is pure trash, you can actually tell that they are selling products that used the cheapest flour, fruits & vegetables are also meh
But in some categories they have good deals
Hofer, Merkur and Spar are better
For me its the worst of the supermarkets and its almost only in the bad districts here
Havent been in one in more than ten years though
I know
Your merkur is a building material market, i don’t know why
Adeg, Billa, Bipa, Merkur and Penny all belong together
Boys and girls meaning kids
Rarely I'd say
Men and women as adults
Sure
I lived for seven years on and off in Hungary - never had the impression you are describing
Cricles of friends there were very mixed
A Hungarian friend was very close with his ex-girlfriend back then and nobody considered even that weird
In Austria there are people qho say that men and women cant be friends, but I think theyre the minority
How should I know
I'm lonely af :(
Yes, absolutely
Yeah I would agree, even though I have also met people in smaller villages that would disagree saying that there is always sexual tension between men and women, making true friendship impossible (which is obvious bullshit)
In Austrian schools we learned that this is part of the child development phases (may be an outdated concept nowadays, not sure)
Basically the idea is that kids in kindergarden don't care about the gender of their friends, but between ~8 and ~13 they segregate into their gendered peer groups for some reason (that's also the age where kids show a lot of tribal behaviour elements)
After that it's common again to have friends of the other gender
How do you answer the phone
For private calls in Austria most people answer the phone by saying their family name
How is it in your country
> For private calls in Austria most people answer the phone by saying their family name
Imo this only applies to numbers you don't know/recognize or people you are not on a first name basis with
In any other case (non-business calls) it would be a regular greeting ("Hallo", "Griasdi", "Servas"....etc)
I let the caller speak first because he/she is the one I assume that wants something from me, and then decide according to that, what to do next
More formal conversations are often like that: [Other person: "Hello this is ... . Am I talking with ... ? Me: "Yes it is ... here, what is it about
Casual conversations are more like: "Heeey wasup
It's meee
I stopped saying my name for numbers I don't know long ago
You called me you know who I am
So a "hallo" has to surfice
Living in Switzerland there is also those super annoying calls about health insurance or other call centers
When I suspect one of those (i.e. it is a land line) I usually don't even say hello and just wait
Puts them off their script every time
well the first written record of the name Ostarrichi was in 996
thats whats usually taken as the founding of Austria
1024years old
The name *Ostarrîchi* (Austria) has been in use since 996 AD when it was a margravate of the Duchy of Bavaria and from 1156 an independent duchy (later archduchy) of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation
Persian culture and history is amazing
Always sad to see "hurr durr Iran, sand and terrorists" comments
i dont really think that counts, as the magyars werent really a country but a horde until they christianized
* A region named Ostarrichi existed probably since 976
* The oldest written record about this name etc
(that still exists) is from 996
* 1156 A separate country (at least a duchy within the HRE)
* 1451 The duke became HREs emperor
* 1803/1806 Austrian empire, now independent from HRE (which stopped existing)
* 1955 Re-founding of the state, in it's current form
I still like the argument that Austria is actually the last remaining piece of the HRE
I know that argument requires a little bias, but still
You forgot 1918, the dissolution of the monarchy and foundation of the 1st republic
The "region" that existed was a march of the HRE (under Bavarian overlordship), so it seems it was a separate entity but didn't necessarily have a name related to Austria
Usually I rent a trailer
If it's to large for a trailer i let it deliver by a flatbed
Furniture stores often have a "Pritsche" (small flatbed) to rent too
Most furniture stores offer light trucks or trailers for rent, depending on how much you buy it might even be free
Alternativly most offer delivery
BTW drywall isnt something you will find all that often in most of Europe
having a van in the family, this would be way more common than somebody owning a truck (also you'd not be able to use it to transport stuff in winter or when it rains
chances are higher with relative who own a business or are tradesmen
alternatively, you own, borrow or rent a trailer
if things are not too big, you'd probably try using a normal station wagon with the seats folded down (because of storage space, station wagons are quite common here, don't know why that's not the case in the US), or putting it on the roof of a normal car with some bungee straps or tension belts
if things are really big, nothing beats renting a dedicated car
rental's close by, and it's cheap enough for a few hours
all that being said, if you get construction material like a pallet of bricks and order a sizeable amount, you'd normally have it delivered to your home
it's normally free, so why deal with it yourself
also we don't do much construction with drywall
The vans are always white and unmarked and the men that come with the can never speak good german
But they're the friendliest and most hard working people I've met
>But they're the friendliest and most hard working people I've met
Except a ton of them are scammers :D
Really
Only problem I had was them not understanding what I want them to do
Was the grill preassembled
I bought one toolast year , fit nicely into my mid sized car
But I had to assemble it at home as it came in parts
Also people do not move that often in Europe on average
Same anywhere in the world when people realize you are Austrian instead of German they become nicer
people used to call them Tante (aunt), same as with kindergarten teachers
not as common anymore nowadays I think
"Hauptschule" has cooking lessons, "Gymnasium" not
The cooking book you get there is really good, my wife use it still today
Only some very basic things
In my 5th grade, yes, we had a cooking class, they showed us how to do simple thing, gave us recipes, it was a cooking class, and it was "mandatory" (isn't enforced or something but you have it as a subject)
Yes we had, but only one year in secondary school
Some of the damn best recipes ever
We had a cooking class in primary school
I had cooking lessons in gymnasium
A working knowledge should be required
Official business and everyday interactions should be possible to master
I dont mind at all
As long as somebody has a job in which he doesnt need German, I dont see the necessity of it
I don't care about people learning our language or "integrating" as long as they respect and obey our laws
Honestly, I coudn't care less about citizenships in general
I think it would probably be good for people living in any country to know the country's language, so they can communicate - for their sake
I figure it must be pretty hard to live in a country if you don't speak the language
But apart from that I really don't care
And I also don't think I should have any authority to decide whether people should gain citizenship in my country or not - after all I've just been born into it
Pure chance
The whole idea of citizenships is a bit absurd in a globalized world
I realize it is still a necessity since different citizenships grant you different rights, unfortunately
But we - humanity as a whole - should probably get over it
I think it’s a difficult question
One one hand yes - I want people who want to become Austrians to be able to communicate with their future countryman
I mean this is also the basis of communal participation - starting from doctors / school visits to elections
So yes - some German should be required
But now there is the question : how much ? And should there be an age limit ? If someone comes here as refugee and is 55 he can obtain citizenship with 60 - is it realistic that he learns the language on the needed level for that at such an age ? And is it needed ?
In the end a B1/2 Level can be archived fairly easily - but does that mean that they speak the language ? It just means he sat in a classroom and a test was taken
I suspect that with *some* countries including Austria the concept of "citizenship" will be watered down in the following decades until all it means is the obligation to do military sevice (for males only ofc)
At that point nobody will want to become a citizen any more
Following that, the very principle of having an official language will be dropped because it won't be workable any more
Having any sort of privilege connected to citizenship or trying to enforce a national language will sound like nationalistic madness to future generations
I'm conservative enough to not like this one bit, but I think it's in the cards
There's a golden visa program
You don't even need Spanish language with that
Just money, although Spanish is a beautiful language imo
Thats sad
I studied art at an international summer academy, and all of our projects were ours to take home after we were done with them
The one thing we were not allowed to do was to sell them during the final exhibition because this was just for showing off everyone's work and not a commercial thing
We had to provide all of our own art supplies, but with our student ID from there we got a discount in some art supply stores
>In my university (in Scotland) the code/programs we write belong to the student not the university,
I assume you are talking about undergrads/not employed
I haven't seen a university yet where research output from employees (includes PhD students) does not belong to the university
> your university is not even aware of their true legal power, they could claim 100% without even passing a new regulation
Very common in academic research but not so much in terms of copyright, universities rarely care about that, but about intellectual property (patents, licensing,...)
However, (undergraduate) students are often not employed, so there are also no work hours
have something similar, but not on the beginning of spring but instead in summer near the end of the school year, after the grading period has finished and there's just a few days left before the holidays
Well today spring skipped the day around Vienna and Winter said:"Nah, I'm not done with you yet, here have below zero temperatures and some snow".
ooh that's a good one, we observe that here as well
yeah and still people skip classes near the end of the school year
don't make this a bigger thing than it is
If you count neighbors as the guys to left and right of you:
The first neighbor is my cousin, the second one organized me a job that i needed to finish school and his wife is related to the wife of my cousine (the one on the other side)
If you call everyone near your house your neighbore:
There are another 3 cousines living on the same street the brother of the one neighbore is living next to the first cousin i mentioned, the son of that guy is also living directly next to him, opposite of my place lives the woman that was my babysitter when i was small, then there is a good friend living next to them
I would say my street is really really close
It's funny if someone from my family celebrates his birthday because everyone is celebrating twice, one time with the family and one time with the street so you celebrate them twice with them in case of the ones living in my street
You yry to avoid noise, mind your own business and only go to him if you got his delivery/need something trivial like sugar or salt
All of my neighbours spy on each other but are not covert about it
We are all living in a small village so things like this are really common, basicly most of my family lives nearby with the exception of 2 living in vienna, 1 living on the czech border and 1 living in poland
There is even a joke that if you are not related to me or my neighbor you don't belong into the village since 80% of the village is related to at least one of these families somehow (but many are related like: my grandmothers cousin married the brother of the wife of his grandfather)
(The village has 300 people)
The reason why many live so extremly close and not more spread out over the village is because the area was farmland and owned by my family, after my grandfather died my uncle decided to not continue the farm so everyone in the family old enough just got a piece od land, under this people where my father and a few cousines

45-60 min bus ride, then a few stops with tram, then a few stops with bus
Commute was about 1 hour in the morning and about 1,5 hours in the evening
Currently unemployed so I hope the public transport connection is better at my future job, because it was a fucking nightmare
Either about 12 minutes by metro or half an hour by tram, I prefer the latter if it gets really crowded on the metro
I don't need to switch lines on any of them so that's super convenient, but I need to walk much more for reaching the tram (which doesn't bother me much, at least not in summer)
20 minute tram and metro ride
5 minute walk, 10 minute bus
About an hour
15mins on the bus and then 35mins on the train (alternatively: 35mins in 2 Metros) finished by a 10min walk
Add waiting
Or: listening through my 2 favourite records for commuting to and from work
~4 minutes walking to the tramway station
~15-20 minutes sitting in the tramway, reading a book, the newspaper, browsing reddit or watching random people
~1-2 minutes walking to university (essentially I have to cross a rather big intersection
The 2 minutes include waiting at the red light)
et voila
Or I take the bike, which also takes around 15-25 minutes (depending on the wind, my motivation and my form)
One hour with country roads, primary roads, and city driving
I could also use a highway most of the way, but that's too risky
If something goes wrong there and there's a jam, it can take somewhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours
5 minutes by car or 25 minutes on foot - would be 10 minutes by bike, but the hill at the end is a problem, and I have to cross a wide, busy street at rush hour
Walk to the subway/tube, ride 2 stations, exit, walk 1 min, takes about 10 min total
Or i can take the bus, takes 10 min or walk 15 min
I walk down 4 floors, walk about a minute to the subway, have a 8-10 minute subway ride and then walk up 2 floors and I'm there
About 20 to 40 minutes by car, heavily dependant on traffic
Still better than 1,5 hrs by train and bus
Go across the street, get into my tram, exit my tram, cross a bridge, done
40 minutes by public transport including walking (mostly due to the early hours), 25 minute bike ride (or 20 if I'm really trying)
I like some parts of it, riding along a park and on the ([newly finished] "bike highways", they make you imagine what riding a bike in the Netherlands must be like: straight, spacious, little to no disruptions
other parts are still in more of a patchwork manner, require stopping at traffic lights and riding next to cars, etc, but overall I'm happy
most importantly, by bike the 15 minute walk from the tram station to the office at the end turns into a 4 minute bike ride, so that's great
also it's my exercise, I normally try to be fast and get my heart rate going
now only if I would have an office that offered on-premise showers and proper bike parking
oh and in winter, wearing high visibility clothing is important, have had a few close calls already
I have a foreign name and I really love it (it is also a great conversation starter with Bulgarians)
I actually really like the spanish version of Joachim, Joaquin
My second name is Wolfgang, glad to hear some people enjoy hearing it
My second name is Friedrich, nice to see someone who's not making fun of it ;'}
And then there’s my family who named a child born in the 2000s not Wolfgang but Wolfram
Yeah that’s fitting
Imagine being a fucking high school kid named Wolfram
Early 20 I would say, but at rural areas old houses tended to build in mind with multiple generation living in it, so people safe rent and stay there
It varies
Some move out with 16 others with 25 and again others never
Are you sure stayed properly in the lineage etc
all the way to 2019

On another topic, you king seems to be one of the many people who call themselves "King of Jerusalem". The last Austrian emperor was another one
(And many others too)
Of course
The point I'm trying to make is, that many of such titles are basically just lies
One of his precedessor just started to call himself that, without any legitimacy
Napoleon lost 3, more or less, bigger battles
My family and I were visiting the Harry Potter studios near London and we wanted to take a picture in front of it so my dad went up up to a woman and asked her if she could take a picture for us
He was in the middle of asking her politely in english when she just answered in an Austrian dialect and we were all pretty surprised
I'll admit that the Harry Potter studio maybe isn't the most unusual place but it was still nice meeting someone in Great Britain who's also from Austria
Wait Sean Connery is the voice of Draco in the original
Holy fuck that was my favorite childhood movie, gotta rewatch it in English now

Same thing with Austria btw
Aye mate
That's not a Schnitzel
Most people from countries with sizable Roma populations are racist against them unfortunetaly
I could be wrong but aren't Strigoi kind of like vampires
I can't not, also love the ballet scenes and the little historical tidbits, because many of them I don't know usually
Sure, breakfast + new years concert is the best start in a new year
I never did it, even though I like classical music
My mind is just not up for it on New Year's Day
We always listen to it while having lunch
I am currently lying on the couch waiting for the Radetzky March
I love it
I'm in Salzburg today for the Salzburg Philharmonic Orchestra, so no viennese concert for me :)
Of course I did, no New Year without the Neujahrskonzert
If you wake up on the 1st and it's not already over, you know you're getting old :D
Enter the lottery for seats next year before february - cheapest tickets start for 20€.
Btw, I much prefer watching this concert on tv - relaxed, while having breakfast
If you are interested in hearing a concert in that same concert hall, there are many more opportunities - at more convenient times
For exaple I once attended the final exam for conduction students there - free entery and fun to watch
You can have breakfast on Jan 1st
I'm usually much too hungover ...

**proper** bread
sweet dishes as the main dish
dishes containing poppy seeds
having three or four beers over the evening and thinking that's not really drinking, apparently
I do ...
popular here as a "healthy" food option, together with all types of more exotic grains (spelt, einkorn, amaranth, etc)
Legal drinking age for non-distilled beverages being 16 as well
I went on vacation near Pula in Croatia with friends from Romania
Didn't know how many opportunities for dick jokes there are if you're really dedicated, what a week
Topfen ️
calling the DACH region to report in: /r/de
no but seriously, proper bread seems to be one of the things you can only get here
This happens to me way too often
Hell no, that would be ... weird
It's was once called "Heiden" and had a tradition as poor man's food
Heidensterz for soup is on of the last still cooked dishes
Seeing spelt as exotic is a bit a hyperole, you can get nearly everywhere and it's grown at 15000ha here, compared to Ameranth which is more often found in gardens as ornamental plant (Fuchsschwanz)
so that's what it's called there
really popular in Austria, we have that instead of baked beans quite a lot
sauce is way better as well
hard agree; and have a cutoff date at around 70
heck make little 4-question quizzes on general knowledge about politics before a vote mandatory, with the amount of points gained influencing the weight of your vote

Tgere are 20 years old having no clue
So you speaking about about a stupid stereotype

Croquetas are life
aah I miss the soft and lifess Japanese welcome hug
solely done because they try hard to adapt to your greeting style, but are weirded out hard by it because they've not hugged anyone except their partner since they were 10 years old
I've never touched people and felt less touched at the same time
might not sound like it but damn I miss Japan
ooh yes, wouldn't know what to do without Topfen
certainly not have Topfenkolatschen, that's for sure
we don't see it as cheese here, more like its own thing among milk products, like cream or yoghurt
We have the same
It's just called Apfelsaft g'spritzt
i have family in drenthe and snackbar is the only term for it i know
yeah I should've put exotic in quotation marks; meant to say that lots of grains are sold under an umbrella term of being organic/natural/healthy/traditional/original
the sauce they're in is weirdly sweet
the packaging in cans makes them feel like an artificially-flavored "unhealthy food". if there's sausages in them, they're the soft, canned, sad kind
they're a weird choice for breakfast when you're used to muesli with milk
finally, because when we're in the mood for white beans in sauce, we normally have [Serbian Bean Soup] instead, which is basically the same but differently flavored (with paprika and spicy)
schorle has to be my least favourite german german word
I know - and I really dont like it
>Apfelsaft
Süßmost tho
I loved it
And then
I drank too much of it and now it disgusts me
But I still love sparkling water
what do you mean with "because they don't like the german one"? we didn't just invent them recently to replace german german words
Well it's Hungarian, but part of our Cuisine:

I might be very mainstream with choice but Sacher Torte is my absolute favorite
The Original Sacher-Torte is probably the most famous cake of all time and the result of several lucky coincidences
In 1832 the Austrian State Chancellor, Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, was expecting guests and instructing his kitchen staff to create a special dessert for the occasion
On the day of the event, however, the cook was sick and so the tricky task of conjuring up “the dessert of the evening” fell on the 16-year-old apprentice chef Franz Sacher
"That he doesn't shame me tonight
" Said Prince Metternich to the student on the way to the kitchen
Franz Sacher knew that this was a unique opportunity for him and thus created the icon of all desserts: The Original Sacher Torte
This must have tasted excellent, because from that day the cake was considered “presentable at court” and was regularly on the menu of the imperial court

For me that would be the "Kardinalschnitte".
Zabaione, panna cotta, Pandoro, ...
That Beethoven was austrian
He was german
That Austria-Hungary was doomed to fail
It wasn't and the whole narrative came about in the 20s when all new nations had to justify their own existence
That Austria started WW2
All the way since Jan Hus
Never really got the whole Beethoven situation, never heard anybody call him austrian

This is the real "common misconception"here: Austria never attempted to convince the world of either
Indeed, but he was german
American and british strategic bombardement caused a lot less damage then the allies anticapated
Most german military and civilian industries were still intact towards the end of the war
Rather have no humour than shit humor, like Slovaks apparently
In Austria we have the Stefanibock, a strong beer brewed in honor of St
Stephen's feast day on December 26th
Yes, Weihnachtsbock
It's not all that famous though compared to Glühwein
Yes, Samichlaus from Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg
Only brewed on the 6th of December and then stored for 10 months before it's sold
With its 14% it's AFAIK one of the strongest lagers in the world
Yes, we do, and at Easter as well: Weihnachtsbock und Osterbock
It's stronger than usual
Not for Christmas, specifically (someone will correct me)
We actually do, it's called Weihnachtsbock
I'm sure some breweries something like this, but it's not a broad tradition
Glühmet and Glühcider as well
But it won't overtake Glühwein anytime soon
Not trying to hinder your search, but it might also be a British thing
Honestly cannot remember where I had it
It was nice though
Some people use it, either in original form or pellets, but for most people wood stoves are a nice extra they put into their living rooms for that extra cozyness in winter
In Austria it's pretty common in villages and farm houses
In rural places in Austria, yes
I have central heating with wood or oil
I usually use oil to heat up before I wake up in the morning and then start heating with wood when I come home from work
I also have a small tiled woodstove in the living room, but its not connected to the chimney at the moment
My neighbour has a 400 year old house with 4 masonry heaters
One huge tiled one for the big living room
One for the kitchen which is the cooking stove at the same time
One for the small living room and the hallway (its basically a woodstove and wall at the same time)
And a smaller stove for one of the upstairs bedrooms
Amazingly the house only has one chimney, despite the stoves being ~15m apart from each other
I will never fully understand how that old house works
My grandma has central heating with oil and a big woodstove that heats the livingroom, kitchen and dining room
She usually lets the oil run on really low heat and does most heating with the tiled woodstove
What
>A wood stove is not that enviromentally friendly
Burning wood is climate neutral
It's not a part of the greenhouse effect as long as new trees are replacing the ones that were cut
>but just burning wood without any filter can't be that good for mother nature
There are filters in reasonably modern stoves and as long as you don't burn wet wood there isn't a problem
>Fireplaces make a comeback currently, but they are just for heating one room
If built smartly you can heat 3-4 rooms with one stove
>I usually help my father chop wood in the spring, then it dries over the summer and is used mostly in the winter
You burn the wood you chopped in the same year
You should store coniferous wood at least 12 months
Hardwood you should store 2-3 years before burning
In your climate you might even have to store it longer than here
Burning wood after storing it for such a short time makes it really ineffecient, you are burning much more wood for less heat
It also drastically increases the amount of toxic stuff thats being released
Furthermore it ruins your chimney
You mean ... a [Kachelofen]
Your Kachelofen has no Kacheln dude
>Yeah, but most people just use it to heat a room
Depends
In rural places were people actually use woodstoves for more than looks, they are arrangend more thoughtfully
In all of the houses in my area I know, there is just one woodstove that only heats one room
And thats the stove for heating and cooking at the same time
Most we learned about the Austrian Empire was in context of how various Habsburg monarchs affected Austria itself
Overall I think there wasn't put that much importance on it
In contrast to the Nazis, WW2 and the holocaust, I remember it being very factual and without any politicizing (not that I am necessarily against that, Nazism is rightfully condemned in our schools)
Personally, while I wouldn't say the Austrian Empire (and later Austria-Hungary) was a force of good, it definitely wasn't evil as it is sometimes portrayed
For a multi-ethnic, absolutist monarchy, it was pretty tolerant and peaceful, and towards the later years there was increasing equality among the peoples
I think it was a fascinating country with a unique overarching culture that is now lost forever
And I like to believe under certain circumstances and with enough reforms, it could have survived and even thrived, possibly to the present day
Most of the crown lands weren't too happy with the representation and being ruled by a country whose language they didn't even speak but in comparison with how the Belgians ruled in the Congo or things like that, we weren't that bad
Was a bit more ambiguous than that with plenty of groups being really invested in the Empire and its system
The only groups that reeeeaaaly were pissed and wanted out no matter what were the Italians and Romanians
Ahh yes and nothing ever happened to the Armenians;)
Spreading FREEDOM^(TM) with military - always a great excuse
when i was in krakow poland I heard that back when Poland was Split up between germany, russia and austria the Part that was in Austria-Hungary had the most luck relatively
Austria built beautiful theaters and did not push the german language through them
The polish theater showed polish stuff
This was not the case in the russian or german territory
On the other hand the Polish were some of the most invested subjects of the Emperor
Especially because Russia proved to be an everlooming hate figure
Did you miss the whole "hungary-being-so-unhappy-they-split-into-a-separate-kingdom-thing"?
Same day as napoleon even
Yeah but after that the desire for getting rid of the Habsburg subsided immensely
Generally it was more of a "I really really want some more autonomy like the Hungarians have" and less " A las barricadas"
It was to prove that they were better than Napoleon, with their mechanised Infantry and everything

Are you a weeb or did you google
That would be [Otto Clemens] although he is a narrator rather than a presenter
He's not that well-known by Name, but anyone who has ever seen a nature documentary ([UNIVERSUM] Terra Mater) on Austrian TV knows his voice
I wasn’t familiar with him, but now that you’re saying it, it does ring a bell
Nowadays documentaries are always foreign ones, thus subtitled, so no iconic voices that I’m aware of
And new Romanian documentaries are afaik nonexistant
>The most iconic would be, in my opinion, the guy who travels around and eats stuff, Jumbo Schreiner
His shows aren't documentaries
HC Strache
Exactly a year ago a video was published of him trying to sell contracts to a (fake) niece of a Russian oligarch, as well as trying to convince her to buy the "Kronen Zeitung", Austrias most popular newspaper
He also explains in detail how his party gets funding without the court of auditors knowing about it
This blew up our right-wing government, made him loose all his positions and income, and there's multiple investigations going on
(afaik, his house has been raided 3 times during the past year)
He's now trying to get back into politics by trying to become mayor of Vienna
Unsurprisingly, it's not working
The strangest thing is, I think he will still get a few percent of the votes in the Vienna election
And I'm not even sure if I should be that mad about it since that's going to cost his old far-right party some votes
I'm not sure he is the most hated nowadays, he is thankfully too irrelevant for that
And after all that, he still had the audacity to name his newly-founded party after himself
Don't forget Kickl
Okay but what about Rita Barbera
I know she's dead already, but I have never met anyone who actually liked her
Which is kinda baffling to me, [how can you NOT like a woman with such class]
Probably Bernd Höcke
Why are they hated
The only positive aspect of HC building a new party is that the FPÖ will lose some voters wich makes both parties pretty weak
He definetly is the most hated because somehow he still finds a way to feud with every otger public outlet or person
Not even his old mates at FPÖ wish him well anymore
I'd say he's the most hated
Everybody loves Kurz for some reason, only the left hates him, or at least doesn't like him, and everybody else is unknown and/or irrelevant
But *everybody* knows Strache
The left has hated him for *decades*. And even though he didn't really take any damage with his fans after the Ibiza scandal, the subsequent "Spesen" scandal of him misappropriating official party money (=tax money) and buying Gucci handbags for his wife from that money, and paying his rent with money from his political party etc
really made him hated among a significant portion of the right half of Austria too
Ironically that's not correct as Kurz got the most resistance from his own party
Some background on this: The ÖVP is traditionally a federal party where power is distributed over State Leaders, Chamber Leaders (all except Workers Chamber) and the Main party
Kurz throw these principles out of the window and disrupted the power balance among the states by making him the sole leader of the party
This is also the reason why he gets so much critique from the heads of states like Tyrol or Vorarlberg (except for his bootlicking friends in Styria and Upper Austria)
Also when he wanted to dissolve the chambers he earned a lot of resistance since most chambers are lead by the ÖVP
When the Kurz-Strache government announced to reduce the influence of the chambers I had to chuckle because I knew he had no real chance against the ÖVP leaders in the chambers
We also should not forget the resistance in the Ministry of Internal Affairs which has now a long black tradition and suddenly was colored blue
The reason why so many scandals leaked out were the ÖVP people fighting against Kickl
Last but not least we have the part of the ÖVP which does care for workers rights, because many people inside the ÖVP value the work of their clubs very high (Volunteer Fireman, Musik Clubs, Veteran Clubs etc
) and with the introduction about the "Flexible Worktime" a lot members of the ÖAAB resigned due to Kurz
The most gain got Kurz from people which went away from the FPÖ. True is he has a lot of followers also in the neo-liberal wing of the ÖVP, but he has many opponents in the conservative and left wings of the ÖVP
But those will vote for him anyway, because they never would vote the SPÖ, Green party or Neos
Of course it is
> But those will vote for him anyway, because they never would vote the SPÖ, Green party or Neos
Yeah that's the point though isn't it
Those people are opposed to him for various reasons, but they don't really *hate* him, which is the whole point of this thread
They depend on Kurz, and even if they oppose him, they like him the way a beaten dog likes his master, because he can bring them the votes they need to do as they please
To a degree no ÖVP-head has been able to do since the 1960s, or at least since Schüssel
> Esperanza Aguirre made sure nobody took her seriously while she consolidated her power
Ah the old "BoJo maneuver". Very clever
No there are a lot who really hate him, like many of the old party members who resigned or [this old lady] Nevertheless these people still vote, because they see it as the vote for the party not the person, and since they see all the opposition as even worse
There is a difference between hating a person and voting for a party
I give you an example from an acquaintance of me, who was part of the ÖVP for 30 years
He was denounced personally by a high functional several times within the party
When voting came his wife still voted for the functional, because she always voted black and she can't vote red
A similar thing holds for Victor Orban
Ö1 made a voters survey several years ago and checking how well perceived Orban really is
Result was that many don't like him at all, but the alternatives were communists and far right wingers, so most voted for him
Hating a person, and voting for the party is for many people a different thing
Some do, but no one should

Is someone who leaves and becomes chancellor in a neighboring country, then annexes his former country and gets rid of its name considered a traitor
Then Hitler
That guy who went to Germany and then invaded us
Hitler
Strache and Gudenus, you might know them from Ibiza
I think so, but I haven't seen it
Technical it was, Hitler gave chancellor Schuchnigg an Ultimatum how Austria should be hand over to Germany peacefully with more demands as they negotiated before, else they move the Wehrmacht to Austria
Schuchnigg gave in, but Hitler gave the command to move in anyway
This resulted in the famous "Gott schütze Österreich" Radio Speech and it was decided to don't resist Wehrmacht
But yeah many were happy about it
Our vice chancellor H.C. Strache was forced to step back, because a video of him in Ibiza was leaked, where he made some suspicious “deals” with a reporter disguised as an influential Russian woman
The leader of the party of "the small man" pretty much trying to sell our country to Russia for financial help during elections
Oh, no wait
The same guy using party funds to pay for his lifestyle while earning a fortune in his position anyway
Oh, no wait
The same guy's wife earning politician's money for her work as the "honorary" commissioner for animal rights within the party (and she managed his Facebook presence
Oh, no wait
The same guy trying to get manager positions for close party friends within the country's largest casino corporation in trade for new laws favoring the casino
Oh, no wait
The same guy's party constantly being tangled up in neo-nazi shenanigans
Shall I go on

Oh, and people still vote for them, of course
Because they save us from the big, bad, immigrants
Ibiza Scandal
Are we doing Ibiza again
Something with Casinos
Honestly, I've lost count and overview of our current scandals
What
the
fuck
There must be people alive to explain this, right
Did they purposefully kill those children
More recently, another corruption scandal involving the same party and the national Casinos company surfaced and is pretty big news right now
Sounds like every right-wing party in the EU is in bed with Russia
I haven't heard anything about "large scale shootings" in Sweden, care to share a source
The Vengaboys even un-retired for a week and gave a concert in Austria as a result of this
what I still can't fathom after reading through many articles reporting on the details of their WhatsApp conversations (because of course, they, including a prospective candidate for finance minister, were all stupid enough to just talk about it openly on WhatsApp), what I still really can't understand though is: why did the FPÖ try so hard and against all opposition and better judgement, why did they try to install *that guy* as chairman of the board of the Casinos Austria
surely they must've had someone equally corrupt at hand who would've been a better fit
who is this guy and why did he deserve this strong lobbying push, and what did *he* do in return for the FPÖ?
Now that's comparing apples to oranges
I don't know if I'm ready to be this depressed on a wednesday morning
Exactly, it's the wish for a "strong man".
Woah, what the hell

What i have heard from a croat who moved first to germany and then to austria (and speaks german really really well) he says that the austrian dialekt in vienna is more different to the way most north german speak then croatian to serbian, and holy fuck if viennese is allready more different then i am declaring austrian it's own language
(He basicly said, if austria and germany would be in the balkans we would not just make fun about each other but instead stab us till noone is moving just over the question if austrian is a different language or a dialekt)
Viennese don't know "dem land tirol die treue" (loyality to the state of tyrol, or something like that, it's hard to translate)
In lower austria (which is basicly next door to vienna, it even surrounds it) thats basicly the austrian equivalent to country roads
(It's of course well known in most of austria and even  in parts of bavaria but espessially lower austria is crazy about it)
In super rural areas people will greet you as they walk past you - It always takes me by surprise :D
First time I heard of this song
Yes, am Viennese
I was born in Vienna, and I know this song
Well, uhh
my father is from Tyrol though
Never heard this either
the fact that catholics are more "fun" (and probably progressive) than protestants always amazes me about the netherlands
it's kinda the opposite in austria
German/Austrian beer is generally better than Belgian beer and the stuff they call beer in the US
Why
It is refered to as the inofficial anthem of tyrol but it is not the state anthem
It's a marsch/volkslied played basicly everywhere where marsch and volkslieder are played
It even run in discos on countryside festivals and theres no other marsch who achieved to be played in discos on a regular base
It is even played on the münchner octoberfest and i heard it in a linzer disco so it isn't just the countryside that knows it
It also made the news some years ago because some italian said it is a ride-wing-propaganda-song
(because of the second verse which starts with:
"ein harter kampf hat dich in zwei geschlagen, von dir gerissen wurde südtirol" )
(a hard fight has slain you in two, south tyrol was taken from you)
yeah
I only came across that song by coincidence like two years ago
has zero importance in Upper Austria imo, so if what he/she says about lower austria is true, then that would be kind of a culture shock to me
I am from Upper Austria and heard that song many times at public events
Majority of people here know it
Craft beer is
also not good
I like Weißbier, helles and Pils
And beyond that I don’t drink anything made outside of Czechia/Bavaria/Austria
I do early don’t even think the other stuff tastes like beer
(And nothing beats Augustiner & Stigel as one other poster said)
Oh wow ... Thanks for the explanation
We're very spoiled with public transport where I live
What
It’s my preference
I don’t care what you or anyone else drinks, and I don’t have to because I’m not drinking it
Yeah, it’s not and that’s my opinion
Taste is absolutely subjective
Please don’t be so hostile, it’s nothing against you personally I just don’t like the taste of craft beer
You have to understand the beer making tradition of Bavaria pre dates your country and for some people this is the only source of national pride they are allowed to show (football/bread/beer/other gastronomy)
Imagine if everything you liked about the US could only be distilled and expressed through something like a food (Oreos for example because they are delicious)
Of course then, despite how you feel about your current politics you fight tooth and nail to prove that America has the best dried cookies, or whatever
I’m waiting for a train so I’m unable to perhaps express myself properly but I hope you understand what I’m saying, for us it’s more than just beer
Also, it tastes amazing and is the best
In Austria  it's "Ministry of defense" (Bundesministerium für Landesverteidigung)
It used to be ministry of war back during the k.u.k. times though
Also "ministry of the countries defense". Makes sense since we're neutral and don't do offense
We had that too for some years
Well, it kinda makes sense
If we actually need to use our tanks to defend ourselves anytime soon then there are two options:
The EU has collapsed and our economy is fucked
Our neighbors have been overrun
In either situation there isn't much we could realistically achieve anyways
At least with a focus on cyber and disasters we can actually make a difference
Though I do agree that it is kind of ridiculous, they could be saving money elsewhere
I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t eat meat
Skiing is the devil and mountains are meh
I don't do cocaine in Ibiza :(
I'm not a big fan of mountains and I regard skiing as incredibly boring
So far there is nobody who enjoys Schnitzel with sauce
Good
How do I "activate" the flag thing
I can't ski (probably
I never tried, could be a natural talent but the world will never know
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ )
I'm not a big skier and normal Schnitzels aren't that good (Surschnitzel on the other hand
Oida
Don't overreact O.o (Ps
you forgot the coffee ;))
Heresy
You have 5 days to leave the country
Does it actually matter in Hungary though
It'd be the only central European country to take it seriously
I literally would in a heartbeat
I’m leaving Austria for much flatter places in a few years as soon as it becomes financially smart for us
That's only Vienna and some other bigger cities
In rural areas there's no way you get something vegan at a restaurant that's not just lettuce or potatoes
Oh yeah, coffee is gross too lol
Cheers mate !
The "Russian solution" for when a solution isn't beautiful, but works
Pretty fitting, if you ask me
Plus most of the other things from German-speaking countries mentioned here
In Austria:
To take a French shower (wearing perfume instead of actually washing yourself)
Polnischer Abgang (to leave like a Pole - leaving without saying goodbye)
Rather self-explanatory, but if something is in "Djibouti", the thing or person referred to is very far away
Oh, here something very Austrian/Bavarian:
# "KRUZITÜRKN
A combination of "Kuruzen" (a group of insurgents in the Hungarian kingdom) and "Türken" (Turks)
It's an expression of disbelief and frustration/anger
I guess it stems from wars with the Kuruzen and Osmans
"Do a polish one
" - Not paying at a restaurant
That's a good one
Heute gestohlen, morgen in Polen
I vaguely remember them using this saying in an advertisement
(English translation at the bottom)
Ma soit gfölligst stoiz aufm dialegt se
Da tirola dialekt moc t and tirola zum tirola, da steirische an steira zum steira, da fränkische an fronkn zum fronkn,...
Wonsdt den dialegt nima lawast don legst an däu fon dena cultua ob und wiasd zum stinknoamalen preisn wie jeda ondre
Everyone should be proud of his dialekt, the tyrolian dialekt makes a tyrolean a tyrolian, the styrian a styrian to a styrian, the franconian a franconian to a franconian,...
If you don't use your dialekt you don't use part of your culture and you are going to be just another prussian (north german) like everyone else
Austria too
That whole "stranger danger" is mostly media induced mass hysteria
There seems to be a nude/none-nude border towards Italy: I have been in a spa in a northitalian skiing area - there you could differentiate the austrian and swiss tourists from the italian ones easily by seeing who was naked and who wore their swimming-cloth in the saunas
I hob koa schimma wohea dea dialegt kumt owa dea is supa
Can i insult you and say that dutch is basicly a german dialekt
The first time i talked to dutch people (it was on the tyrol-salzburg border during my holiday 5 years ago or so) i thought that they spoke some north german dialekt and they don't understand my dialekt
So i started talking with them in english (i don't like high german because i swap to dialekt within one sentence, so it is easier for me to use english in such situation, nowadays i am better at speaking high german over an extended period of time but back then it was almost impossible for me) while they kept talking dutch and it worked really well
I needed half a hour to realize they were dutch and i only noticed because they asked me why i understand dutch but aren't speaking it
If you asked me how that even started, i asked if i can  play table tennis with them and they said to each other: "wat wil hij van ons
" Which is really similar to the german: "was will er von uns" Which i understood so i repeated in english and we just kept on talking like this
(The version in my dialekt: "wos wüdan vo us
" Is even more of from the high german version then dutch so you can't blame me from thinking it was german)
And yes i started to speak and learn dutch a year ago so now i could even apeak with then in dutch (at least to some degree)
Pretty much every lowsider will land you on your knees first

["Das Fest des Huhnes" ("the feast of the chicken")] is a very good analysis of Austrian habits, especially for rural regions
It is mainly about way of life, traditions and rituals
(/s)
For Austrian history Hugo Portisch (a recently deceased journalist) made a very good summary of Austrian history in the 20th century)
"Österreich I+II" is more or less the standard documentary for Austrian students to watch when learning about the 20th century
Unfortunately I couldn't find a free link to watch it
(and I'm not sure if it's available in English)
I saw the 6 DVD Box of Österreich 1 for 30€ at Thalia ,recently, I didn't hesitate
I don't think it's available for streaming anywhere
Afaik there are some Episodes of it at YouTube, but Not all
[Edit: yeah, one of the later ones]
Österreich I alone has already 12 episode á ~90 minutes
To get a feeling of how it is [here's the episode 7 on YouTube] It's about the Anschluss
Sadly there's no subtitles and sadly the other episodes are not online
There is Schuachblattln
And then there is this drinking sport where people stand around a tree trunk trying to nail nails into it while getting drunk (någln) for reference:
„Schappen“
On 28th December in Carinthia (Austria) kids go around the village and strike older people with rods while saying a magic spell that rhymes and should keep the old people healthy
The kids are then paid by the people they have hit
In Austria we have "Fasnacht" which is basically a carnival held every 4-5 years from November to February
Every town and village has its own tradition
The main goal is getting extremely drunk (like every austrian tradition) and people are organised in groups with different nonsensical themes (like Bears, Guys wearing women clothes etc)
But the weirdest part of it by far has to be the musician group
It basically consists if the local traditional band and one day in February they take a goat to every restaurant, hotel and bar in town
They stay there and get everything for free until the goat shits on the floor for good luck
Then they move on to the next bar
Is this an authentic [video]
Can‘t believe it
Nagln is fun though, although I am terribly bad at it
Every time I think I have heard the weirdest thing about Austria, I learn something new that’s way weirder
Absolutely
I love to see how people get better the drunker they are
Oh my fucking god, yes
That is probably the most random thing we do
I feel incredibly bad about myself right now and will chastise myself for it
Will you ever be able to forgive me
I will have you know that Tampern/Schellenschlagen whatever else they call it is WAY weirder and also the worst lol
What about that time of year when when a bunch of people get together to dress up as monsters, set fire to stuff, and hit girls with sticks while Saint Nick's handing out presents in the background
Hot take: Bernd das Brot was peak millenial humour before being a "millenial" was a thing

I actually never did that

My American wife straight up thought I was making that shit up until she moved here
I wish I had made it up, it’s awful
yup, my grandmother is dutch and it took me a few years to realize that having these calendars isn't normal in austria
In Austria as well

Austria: 1938 Supporting Nazi-Germany to take over Austria country in the hope to have a better life

If you're writing this from an Austrian POV, I think it was actually brilliant
If you are writing it from Richard's view, it was preeeetty dumb
That's not really a dumb thing tough
At least in Civ the units get pushed out of the borders on declaration
**yes**
As far as I see it, they started
I mean
harbouring the killer of the heir apparent was kind of a dick move
Yeah, we got some sweet loot outta that, financing fancy new walls for Vienna and a few other cities and even founded an entire new city (Wiener Neustadt) with it
It was planned to send the little that was left over from it back to England so Leopold didn't get excommunicated but the english people sent to pick it up refused to take it for fear of getting robbed on the way home
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
IIRC, technically that money was never paid back
Let's see how the Brexit unfolds
If the English become desperate enough, they might come back to it
It *was* a shit ton of silver after all
You're absolutely right
It was about the conspirators, not about the assassin (and a few other things)
But in contrast to WW2, every major European nation wanted WW1
Germany was lobbying for the demands to be unfulfillable
Russia had growing aspirations in Eastern Europe and alongside the Black Sea, France wanted revenge for losing Alsace-Lorraine a few decades back, Britain had no bilateral obligation to join the war but did anyway, Italy wanted territorial growth itself
So that one is only partially on us I suppose
I might be biased but I like the Austrian plates most
I particulately like that we have our national flag as the outline of the numberplate and the clean design overall
[Example]
The first one or two letters indicate the district where the registered possessor resides
Then there is the heraldic emblem of the federal state the district belongs to
Firebrigade, Police etc
have their own heraldic emblems
Then there is a three to six-letter/number sequence
Usually it's three numbers and two letters
For normal districts
I think only very big cities deviate from that
[I also really like the Slovenian plates with the green outline] and the [Croatian plates which also use the national flag
] But I don't like the Croatian font as much
Ok, bit of a different topic, but I like to rant about this:
The Austrian plates are the ONLY standardized EU-Plates, that aren't the actual standard size
For some reason we thought it would be a good idea to add little strips of our national flag on the top and bottom, making the plate about 1cm higher than the standard
Learned it the hard way ordering standard size plate holders
I really like the "official" ones, like police, military and some government cars, that have the [coat of arms]
And obviously, the district and letters make great number plates, like [PE*NIS 20]
I like our [license plates for electric cars] even more
The green letters look great together with the red stripes
Don't bring up [white numbers/letters on a black background] It's still a sore point for us Austrians filled with nostalgia and not wanting to let go
With a little refresh, those could've been on par with Liechtenstein
Edit: Ooh
They're on that website you linked
Cool
>Liechtenstein
>In a nice reversal of the usual design theirs are white numbers on a black background
Agree
Looks awesome on black cars especially
They were really pretty :(
Fun history fact:
(sorry, only found a German link)
>It's still a sore point for us Austrians filled with nostalgia and not wanting to let go
I've never heard anyone express this opinion, not even very old people
Is this really a common sentiment
Also, I've seen about three cars with black plates in my life and all of them were extremely shabby
Yes
Also, I'm pretty sure German police has a few Porsches too
Oh wow that's even prettier than white on black
Not for young people, I may have really over exaggerated that - as one does
But back then it did cause quite the controversy, I think it was in the media for almost a year
Even Hundertwasser was played a role in that discussion
u/lila_liechtenstein posted this link that summarizes it quite well: [
Very interesting
I had no idea
It's like with currency since I never used the old one I can't be nostalgic for it but older people will still talk about it sometimes
Speaking of Hundertwasser, I recently learned that he was a monarchist
Wouldn't have taken him for a nostalgic type based on his art but I guess he was
I really like his license plate design

It differs I’d say
I myself have a pretty old-style handwriting, like my grandfather has
He and I both make the capital Z with a line and the lowercase z without
But there are many people that don’t make a line at all
There isn’t really a standard handwriting here
Of course when we learn writing in elementary school, everyone at first follows the teacher’s example
But after that most people change their handwriting to their liking and comfortability
And combined with an 's' beforehand you get the [Eszett or 'ß']
Most people have one (or 2), but they are not used much
Not common, but also not too uncommon
very common, they're just your second(and third, etc) first name and can legally be used as such
rarely people use them all, I don't even have them in my passport (they are on my birth certificate though)
traditionally, names chosen were of older relatives (dad, grandma, etc), also common were certain Christian names (it's a Catholic country after all)
but contemporarily, the freedom is higher, and I actually like the system
it's a way of giving funky or interesting names to your kid without fucking up their future, because you were sensible enough to  name them "Stefan" before "Romulus Esteban Zapotek".
Yeah, it's pretty common if you ask me
Yes, and the most I know is someone with 6 middle names
Yeah but guys don't give your kids a second first name, right
same here
traditionally, names of older relatives or certain Christian names (Catholic country after all); contemporarily, a way of giving funky or  interesting names to your kid without fucking up their future because you were sensible enough to  name them "Stefan" before "Romulus Esteban Zapotek".
I was the only kid in my secondary school class who didn't have a middle name, but many of my friends would rsther die than reveal their middle name for some reason
First spending hours in the kitchen cooking an awsome breakfast for your kids and then being ok with them only taking a bite before they leave

i have a keychainthing thats mostly formed like a coin, but then it has a rectangular piece - so i can insert it in the coin slot - get the cart free - and pull the keychainthing out
(i always put the cart back and on the chain - but its easier for me to have not fumble with something after putting it back or coins i have to put away - so i take the cart back on the chain and drive off without something (coins or else) to stuff somewhere
> Good morning is almost like saying "this is a good morning to spend with you," unless it's just a one off thing and then it's naturally "I wish you a good morning

>  "What do you mean
" he said
"Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on
we have those rather seldom - mostly the ones where my keychainthing works fine :)
(only a slot for the coin nothing to close) - downside for them is, sometimes coins pops out when taking the chain back in  - or are a little stuck and are harde to get out - so my keychainthing helps me with these a lot
The [University of Economics] in Vienna
The [inside of the library] looks like a spaceship
The whole [campus] looks really cool in my opinion
And the stations of Vienna's [U5 metro line] (as soon as they're done)
The [Unipark] of the University Salzburg is also pretty cool
But the best thing about it is probably [the view]  onto the fortress
The [Graz Museum of Modern Arts] is considered as a shining example
(I personally don't like it, though)
That library reminds me of the citadel in mass effect

They're pretty good and expanding over even more of Europe
Ah, okay
I was guessing it might be "megameter" but I'd never heard of that
Makes sense though
Thank you

In the case of ÖBB/DB it's more that the DB is a factor that's dragging the performance down, rather than enabling the full potential

I mean with [Sissi] we have already one
I‘d make them baroque and habsburgian kind of style, for obvious reasons
Aka just take Sissi/Princess Elisabeth but draw her in disney style and that‘s it

Imho all Adaptions other than the older Anime are already really lacking, I really don't want to know what Disney would do to Heidi

You know that in the Disney version, her sidekick would be a wheel of cheese
Anastasia was a Fox movie, not Disney
We have the movie poster in our office, and from afar it looks like it has a [big glowing penis] on it
It would be awesome to have a Disney movie with artwork inspired by the Ivan Bilibin illustrations of Russian folktales
It would feature a soundtrack with Elton John trying to yodel while singing the tragic ballad of Alm-Öhi
For sure, she was always more popular in Hungary
Happy to share with any of the former crown lands :)
Oh, didn't know it
Don't know what I should think about it
I mean the old movies are quite average, it's more nostalgia
Yeah Romy Schneider looks great in it
She was an Bavarian duchess, yeah, it's even the movie
I just had a horrible mental image of the movie soundtrack being an endless remix of the Nokia tune
Would watch movie about Princess Holger
Would probably be confused and intrigued
Is- is one of her names really Tanpon in French or is that a typo
She still needs a sidekick though
Maybe a [Lipizzaner] horse
They'd fit in with the Austro-Hungarian empire theme, and they already featured in an old Disney movie
And the real Sisi did love horse-riding
> The scenery is mostly Austrian
I have no idea why everybody keeps claiming that
Austria doesn't even have a coast, let alone a mountainous coast
Also the name Arendelle -> Arendal (Norway)
It depends on your definition
Disney Princess**** is an [actual franchise] after all, which is why Moana and Pocahontas get to be princesses even though they're not royalty, and why Elsa from *Frozen* actually isn't a Disney princess despite being a princess and in a Disney movie
She travelled a lot but [Gödöllő] was one of her favorite places
It would have to be a double-headed eagle to keep things Austro-Hungarian
I can see potential for comic relief there
But if we pick Sissi (Sisi) as a pincess, then a horse would make most sense as her animal sidekick
Sisi was an excellent and avid rider and even took lessons in circus horse riding
Pfff
Barely
As if that 800-inhabitants-town hadn't way too much tourism anyway
I wonder how they'd include her crippling depression, her ano-/ orthorexia and her out of control coke habit into a Disney movie
And the whole incest thing
I'm sure they'll do fine, and turn it into a suitably catchy song for the soundtrack too
There are so many - St

The L-Tower in Arenbergpark is used as a shed by the Municipal Department 42 - Parks and Gardens
Yeah the one in Stiftskaserne, the partner of the Haus des Meeres one
AFAIK it's also an emergency bunker for the government in the case of an attack
Real estate agents, followed by journalists
Ordnungsamt
And teachers for some reason
Everybody has an opinion about teachers, but nobody wants to do it
I got nothing
The biggest scandal this year, the [Ibiza affair] which subsequently led to the dissolution of the government, was exceptional and a huge scandal and got exactly the international attention it deserved
Which means for a small country like Austria: 2-4 weeks of major attention by foreign German-speaking media, and 2-3 articles each in foreign-lanuage media
Can't really think of anything small that was blown out of proportion
Usually nothing happens much in Austria
It's worse when your family from other parts of the country tells you these "stories" about the city you live in
Even as a joke that's pretty *yikes* IMO
Probably stuff like "Germany is majority muslim already, No-go areas in German/Swedish cities, the numbers of rapes have rises because of dirty muslim" etc etc
You see this kind of shit regularly on reddit
I heard Bosnia has lots of Muslims nowadays
Damn immigrants ^/s
Bernie Sanders would fit in sorta well with the Social Democrats in Austria, and they're centre-left
Go on from there
The latter part is kinda funny coming from someone who's from the UK right now
But yes, I'm aware of what you're pointing out
That's why the Bernie analogy works pretty well - he's pretty representative for the left(est) wing in the Dems
Of course there's still people further left of him, but he's a pretty good ballpark in general
Europe in general has advanced in the left tech tree further than the US and it shows in the political landscape
I found myself sitting in the garden of my favourite neighbourhood restaurant with a glass of tap water, a spritzer and a schnitzel ... within an hour and a half of touching Austrian soil after four months abroad
Drinking beer while wearing Lederhosen I suppose
Klingt komisch, is aber so
Did you fall off a balcony or piss in someone's doorway
If not we're good ... I guess ;)
Bread, like dark bread, or bread rolls
Because we eat Schnitzelsemmeln on trips too
On a Playground, in the garden of some family i dont know, in an empty House and once in Czechia, about 20 km beyond the border
Thats about 170 km from where i passed out
Bis grad eben war ich noch felsenfest überzeugt davon, dass Peter Lustig die Sendung mit der Maus moderiert hat ... ich bin alt und es ist spät. Du hast natürlich recht
Haha, same
Dual citizenship is only allowed in some exceptions
I think that's good
One can not be a full worthy citizen of multiple countries
Citizenship comes with responsibilities and many can't even properly fulfill those responsibilities for one country, no matter two
I'd be in favor of lowering the requirements for getting our citizenship though, I think the monetary requirements and 10 years of residence make it too hard for many to go through with it
It's not very popular because of A) envy (why should someone get to have 2 citizenships and vote in 2 countries while I can't?) & B) right wing parties fear mongering that Turkish/Arabic citizens infiltrate the society and change the country into a caliphate or something like that
Personally I have no problems with it and find it pretty stupid
A close friend of mine is from Poland and has strong ties but at the same time after going to school abroad they studied in Austria and consider Vienna their home just as their childhood home in Poland
However the Austrian state makes them choose between the two countries
Now a lot of people see that justified, I personally don't. You wouldn't wanna choose between your two parents (given it's a happy family)
But it is what it is
With 2 EU citizenships their votes count twice when it come to people sitting in the European Council (which is more a theoretical issue, but still)
I would support it, if there is a way to mark one citizenship as your "main" one with some massively easier way to switch that one for one of the others you have, at least when it comes to other rights than pure travel
Evading citizen duties like military service and in some cases taxes while still being able to influence the life of people living in the country massively by voting in elections even though the outcome of these barely influences your own life is unfair
Especially if people that are residents here but are not citizens can not vote
Lastly it is a good test on how serious you actually are, similar to a marriage (which also often is considered quite singular in western societies)
Don't want to give up your current citizenship even if it wouldn't make much difference either way
Well, then why should you have both instead
Clearly you don't feel THAT connected to this place after all, just somewhat enough to also be willing to influence elections
>The USA, famously, doesn't care so you can just renounce your American citizenship and live in stateless bliss
The USA does care
If you don't pay thousands of dollars and wait months to go to the process of renouncing your citizenship you'll stay a citizen and will have to pay taxes
we had the first official case 1983 and in 1985 the "Aids care" was founded with the help of the ministry of health, which opened care centers in every state where you could get anonymous tests and info material
I remember much of sex ed and drug ed was focused on the danger of it and you should always were an condom and never share a needle
I can't remember being discussed a lot in public about it
French sounds soft and sexy, russian sounds strong
I love both languages and could listen to them for hours
My least favorite is portuguese
i don't know, it kinda sounds like a mixture of spanish and croatian
I don't like it
Edit: Oh, and i forgot scottish
I just love how it sounds, although it's a little bit weird
I love the sound of Italian, Portuguese (pure music), cheerful Russian, and angry French
Special mention goes to Basque, which sometimes has a certain German feel to it (because of the tz tx (tsch) and k sounds), but in the next moment sounds completely out of this world
Absolutely love it
I used to love the sound of Spanish, and I still do, but ever since I speak it fluently, the feel is different, because there's so many other things I can concetrate on other than the sound
Excuse me
Have you seen Goran Visnjic in "Santa Clarita Diet"? When he spoke serbian it sounded so damn badass that my panties flew off
German can sound badass if spoken by an angry man (i.e. Christoph Walz or Till Lindemann) but serbian always sounds badass and sexy, no matter who speaks
I think a lot of people like german because of Rammstein
Which part of Germany
I know, but in the show he was from Serbia, so i guess he spoke serbian
Yeah that's certainly different than Hochdeutsch haha :)
Well, i kinda liked it
It was a little bit gory, sometimes gross, but all in all entertaining
There are better shows, but it's ok
If you have nothing better to do, you can watch it
But i got incredibly angry when they made a huge cliffhanger at the end of season 3 and then decided to not make a 4th season
I hate when this happens
Belarus and Russia
I don't think Germany deserves all those Nazi jokes
We do
But they don't.
Japan, Indonesia and Iran
Picking some underdogs here (esp
the latter)
As little kids, we sometimes got referred to as „kleine scheisserl“ (little shitlings)
And i kind of liked it
Literally: „Kluane“ –> „Kleine“ [Shorty, Tiny, Little One] in standard german
They still call me that
I‘m the youngest out of the family and have been the shortest for a long time, right now I‘m a little bit taller than my mom tho
My grandpa is from the southern state of Carinthia and he used to call me "Lota" which means "large man"
"Has", which means a rabbit or bunny
Even my uncles and aunts called me by that name
Not my parents but my grandma calls me "kara dana" which means dark/black bull in turkish because of my hair colour
She calls my bigger brother "sarı dana" (yellow bull) because his hair colour is blonde
Never heard anyone else nickname their grandsons or granddaughters like that, but i find it very sweet
Cant wait to visit them in the summer this year
I read Minjung as Mischung and was confused as to why your dad calls you an alcoholic drink (wine + mineral water/soda, I think it‘s called Weinschorle in Germany)
mies bruder
Haha mine was Merlin, which was our cat's name
What I can think of is that the "lein" in Fräulein or Kind-lein is used to belittle something, similar to "Chen"
Where in Austria do people call it Mischung instead of Spritzer
I didn‘t know that, that‘s actually very interesting
Yeah Mischung is traditionally often given out at (traditional) festivals or traditional wine taverns we call „Buschenschank“ (which doesn‘t exist in Germany, if you are interested you can google it)
The word „Schorle“ doesn‘t exist here, at all
Apfelsaft gspritzt eg would be Apfelschorle (Only Weinschorle is called Mischung (I have heard people call Johannisbeerschorle - does that exist
- Johannisbeermischung, but if you say Mischung and nothing else you specifically mean Weinschorle
Both exist
I‘m from Styria if that helps, but usually when I went around about anybody who works for stuff (????) that have Spritzer/Mischungen they‘re usually familiar with both names
I work in a Buschenschank and hear Mischung and Spritzer about equally as often per day, maybe Spritzer less, if not many people came around
I mean, why not
is your uncle fernando torres by any chance
Somehow I completely understand all of what you said and also see how you can differentiate between Muesli and Müsli in spoken language perfectly but at the same time I think this is nuts AND very interesting
Thanks a lot, I'd never heard Mischung before
Idk dude I don‘t drink alcohol, it‘s just kinda become a tradition or become our culture, I can‘t give you reasons as to why some old people who don‘t live anymore decided to do that
Maybe if another Austrian who does know sees this can answer you
For us it‘s both red and white wine
Red wine is more common with the „skinny old dude“ and sometimes older women, whereas white whine is more common overall
Interesting to know that in Germany it‘s only white wine tho
It’s ok for learning vocabulary and how to use it
Grammar is a big issue
I refreshed my French with it, and for that it was ok
But I knew the basic grammar from Highschool
A friend of mine and I both started Spanish on Duolingo at the same time
I took Spanish classes in high school where we started off with grammar, so I've got a basic knowledge of that
And while I believe I might have an easier time understanding why a sentence in built in a certain way because of this, I don't think he's lagging behind all that much
From my limited experience I don't feel like doesn't help you at all
Concerning grammar, the thing is that if you learn Spanish from German, you don't get the tips you would get if you learned it from English
Tips are where the grammar is explained and it's just not available in German, for whatever reason
I took a brief look at the tips for the first few courses from English-Spanish and if they were available in German-Spanish too I don't think there would be much missing
There's also a forum where people can ask questions, but it's not available inside the mobile app
But, of course, you're not gonna become a C2 in a language from using a FREE app
If you master a course though I'm sure you could find your way around on a holiday
Sauce on schnitzel
Here it's not commercials *for* gambling, since those would be illegal
Instead they have commercials about what a great time people have at casinos, socializing, drinking and smiling
While I do agree that it should be illegal, I do also understand why there's more of a focus on female circumcision
There's a reason it's commonly called Female Genital Mutation instead of circumcision - it's far more horrible and aims to completely destroy the function of the genitals instead of cutting off a, let's be honest, pretty useless part
Finally
Jessas
The same is true for female genital mutilation though
To serve vienna schnitzel with fries is also really common
And i'm surprised that your wiener schnitzel is actually made out of veil'isch meat
If you order one in germany more often then not it is made out of pork (in austria you would then serve it under the name "schnitzel wiener art" (schnitzel the viennese way))
And my biggest problem is not with the sauce itself, you can eat your schnitzel with sauce but you do not poor it over the schnitzel like most do it
Just put it in a seperated part and just dip it
Why make a wonderful crispy schnitzel just to make a soggy mess out of it by pooring sauce over it
Did you really think we hate the germans for no reason
Incomparable to FGM
Not having it doesn't inhibit function though
What do you not understand about "I agree it should be illegal"?
All I'm saying is that it's not as much of a big deal when compared to FGM
Still barbaric
It's sadly more common than you think :/
Yes it does, the penis is less sensitive and sex doesn't feel as intense
There's a higher risk for inability to orgasm
I already said above that I agree it should be illegal
It's barbaric
I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me
Doesn't change the fact that FGM is far more horrible
So that's the reason Americans and Jews don't have sex eh
Yes, in some cases there's a problem, and that's bad, don't get me wrong
Again, I'm FOR banning it
Doesn't change the fact that it's not in any way comparable with what they do to women
Uh what
Who's hostile
There's lots of mythological creatures, but one that is on my mind occasionally is the [Håbergoaß] a humanoid goat-creature and with glowing eyes, that roams fields and forests at night and snatches little kids in the dark in order to eat them
Its bleat is so loud and terrible, it goes through marrow and bone
My aunt told me scary stories about it about it when I was 5 or so, which then I told my best friend, while I was sleeping at his place
We couldn't sleep until very late, and constantly looked out of the window to check if we could see the Hobagoaß somewhere in the dark
Scary shit
I'm a grown man now, but still, sometimes when I walk alone in the dark I still involuntarily imagine it waiting for me behind a tree or a corner
I think in my mind this archetypical figure is a representation of the primal fear of the dark and the uncertain
It's like it's burned into my brain
A few more noteworthy would in our folklore would be
* Perchten in general (the Habergoaſß is one of the Schiarch-Perchten)
* Die wilde Jagd (The wild hunt): Warriors which hunt ghosts over your head
* Lindwürmer (Wyvern): Klagenfurt has even a statue
* Krampus
* The Devil himself: We have a lot of places where it is said you can meet the devil at midnight
For example we have a stone which is said that the devil has dropped in our village
* Manderl: Small creatures which live in nature
Most famous would be the Wörthersee Manderl which created the Wörthersee by filling it with water from an infinite water bottle
don't worry, totally unthinkable here as well
it is not the whole world that lives in un-confucian anarchy
reverse TIL, the notion that somebody would find that "racist" really surprised me
it's a tradition, it's paint
what do people do when somebody dresses up as the Grinch, claim it's hurtful to The Hulk
that discussion is still unthinkable down in the Catholic south (we have a similar costume on Jan 6th), and I'm honestly glad, because I think it's mostly based on painfully ethnocentrically ignoring the context, and on forcefully implanting a discourse into a surrounding where it makes no sense
[highly relevant link]
I can just tell you about my personal experience from about 80% of the house parties I attended: The host fills his bath tub with water and puts in a "base" amount of alcohol, like two trays of beer (2x24 cans) and the leftover alcohol from the last party
Every guest would then bring something along with them as they arrive, be it beer in cans, bottles of wine or something like vodka/gin/schnaps
The alcohol gets put in the bathtub, stronger stuff would go in the freezer
There's a *mild* expectation that heavy drinkers would bring more alcohol, and people who are planning on staying more or less sober would bring only a bottle or so
Some people would skip out on bringing anything, but nobody's really checking that closely
Close friends of the host are expected to definitely chip in
Oh and depending on the party, alcohol debt can partially also be paid in food (something like noodle salad, cakes or hummus dips)
During the party, it's a free-for-all, everybody just drinks whatever they want or can find
This is like the majority of parties I attended worked here, the ramaining 20% only with the difference that the hosts didn't fill their bathtub, but the fridge instead
I sat under them at school (while being in the tropics, mind you) and hated them
Way too much wind, would always have a hurting neck/shoulders because of that afterwards
I actively looked for spots in non-airfanned corners
Neither proper AC nor ceiling fans are common here
Even greener
strawberry I know, but cherries is definitely new
Not every Austrian lives in the Alps

More like, for an adult native speaker no everyday word is really new
&#x200B;
But loanwords aside, "technical" jargon of any subject (be it biology or naval things or whatever) might be a problem
Sometimes it's clear, like a specific word for male animals is always "der", and for compound words it can be derived from the parts
But there are cases where we need to rely on a feeling/guess or don't know it at all
Pretty sure it's a German German thing, never heard this word before
Also, when I read your post title, I thought it was the parking lot somehow wandering about :D
We have parking lots at more frequented places, but in general if you want to go for a walk in the forest or in the mountains you can just leave your car on the side of the road
I do not know if its perfectly legal but if there is enough space such that traffic can pass by no one will complain, and everybody does it like this
Exactly
Also, "Die Wanderhure"... will never get this one out of my mind, unfortunately
And your username makes me hungry :D
Austrian TV hasn't had to a acquire anything new in 15 years
Every day, they show two episodes of Scrubs, followed by two eps of Malcolm in the Middle, followed by 2 How I Met your Mother, then 2 Big Bang Theory, 1 Simpsons, and now apparently they throw in a Young Sheldon and The Goldbergs
Sometimes they treat us to some episodes of The King of Queens or The Nanny
Oh, and in the morning they just show exactly the same things they broadcasted the previous afternoon
&#x200B;
EDIT: Another channel shows five episodes of Two and a Half Men a day, followed by three episodes of Navy CIS (that are then immediately repeated)
Yet another channel will show FIVE episodes of Criminal Minds in one go this evening, followed by repeats, which means TEN HOURS of Criminal Minds
That channel also shows Jane the Virgin between 4 and 5 am
Scrolling through the programmes I was impressed when I found them showing Black-Ish on a Saturday, as that's the newest series I found
Is Inspector Rex still running
German crime thrillers often aren't that bad
It's okay, I just watch a lot of Netflix instead
It‘s a reference to the show Trailer Park Boys
Nope
Its a Canadian show
Intetesting fact: the first known condoms were invented in Wales
They used the intestines of sheep (much the same way a sausage is encased in animal intestines)
It was the English who finally decided to take the intestines out of the sheep though
Well the Lederhosen and beer thing is true tho, we do have lederhosen and dirndl as traditional clothes, and the second highest beer consumption in the world, but the exaggeration of it annoys most people
Also I fond the complaining stereotype amusing becaise it's honestly true
Same here in Austria
> and most people in Spain are against it
So why is there no vote or something like that against it
You are not
What about the "everything tries to kill you" stereotype"?
> The stereotype I hate is foreigners thinking we’re all rich
I don't think people really think everyone in Switzerland is rich for Swiss circumstances but compared to what people make in other countries
Friends who moved to Switzerland make about double for a similar job
No it's definitely not an American thing
Lots of people from many different countries have told me that "Omg German sounds harsh". Then after hearing me speak it (e.g. with my mom on the phone) usually they were surprised
But I agree, probably Hitler has something to do with it
[Trevor Noah, whose father is Swiss, has a fun skit about that]
> I don’t care “who is receiving the action”
I imagine that can lead to some misunderstandings in bed
That stereotype was like 20 years ago at this point
Happens all over Europe these days
Good to hear
Yes of course
But that's kind of the point, everything is so much more expensive there so people have to be "rich", right
People simply (and wrongly
) ignore the difference in buying power and compare those values to their own income/cost of living
Idk what is in your English genes that makes you guys so resistant against cold temperatures :D My Friends from Birmingham brought a denim jacket as a coat when they visited Vienna in Winter ...
I'm hardly ever cold, but short sleeves without jacket
Around 16 to 18° Celsius, minimum
This reminds me of how the inhabitants of my village knew when there was an english boarding school on a ski trip: after they came home from skiing, hoards of teens would roam trough the streets wearing t-shirts and shorts
in February/March in an alpine valley mostly covered in snow
I’m from the Alps and my absolute comfort-temperature is 15-19°C.
If I‘m going jogging, 5°. If I‘m walking/sitting, 15°.
But are you familiar with us Waldviertler
I would personally, for myself, say 2°
Lol my Husband is a Waldviertler in fact
He always talks about the *Permafrostboden* up there
But he's always colder than I am
Its the year 230

Humanity is long gone
The squids who now roam the earth partake in an odd ritual where they swim from the temple of Londonoria to Brussalantis to ask for an Ex Ten Tion from the Old Ones
Nobody knows the origin of this ritual, but the prophecy says that the realm of Londonoria will fall to ruin if the ritual is missed even once
Archduke Johann is very popular in Styria for his investments in there
Andreas Hofer is popular in West Austria for his resistance against Bavaria and Napolean
Mozart is pretty popular, idk if you coun't that as hero
There are tons of war heroes from the Empire times which aren't really worshipped anymore, e.g. Radetzky and Tegethoff
more recent heroes could be: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hermann Maier, Andi Goldberger, Wayna Pawiasek ([what a gwoup]
Radetzky March
Enough said
Team Mira Lobe
>Wayna Pawiasek
UwU
He grew up in Prague at a time where it was considered mainly German town
He also spoke German almost exclusively throughout his career and resided in Vienna
If he's Czech he's a Austrogerman Czech
And his adolation also was mostly centered im Vienna
Ethnicities in the Empire, especially in the cities were just too mixed to portray them as one and one nationality alone
That is especially true for the nobility
Iirc he woke up but is still potato
I dont think thats something you recover fron
Problem is that we can't really speak about nationalities like you do before the middle of the 19th century when the concept was entrenched within the population
Being of the Czech nation in an age before narionalism meant very little - especially in the framework of the multiple personal unions of the Habsburgs
There was only the concept of the House of Austria which subsumed the population under the ruling dynasty
Radetzky was a member of a cosmopolitan class of people within the empire who are not easily classifiable
But the point remains that the center of his life was Austria proper and Vienna in particular
And if Mozart is German because hes a HRE citizen then so are all Bohemians and Moravians xD
But its fun talking about this
Nationalism and nationality before the spring of nations is a very fuzzy topic and also quite contentious and thus quite fascinating
No I did not refer to plans for German unification
Radetzky grew up in the 1770s - a time were the national genesis of most of central Europe was far from the spring of nations 80 years later
Which he by the way helped to put down enthusiastically
Look Radetzky throughout his life refused to define himself ethnically and only ever identified himself as a soldier of the Empire
He didnt care a bit about his childhood home and instead saw the Austrian army as his home
He was an army man through and through - in the end his maxim was: Legio Pater noster
My grandpa fought in WWII and was captured by the russians (as war prisoner), and came back after the war
My other grandpa was conscripted just months before the end of WWII and could go practically go home right after being called in
My Grandfather fought in Stalingrad, got wounded six times before they sent him home
Interestingly enough, he was in the french foreign legion before he got drafted into the Wehrmacht
Other Grandfather was only 12 when the War ended, had to hold some russian Soldiers at gunpoint who tried to rape his sister though
My great grandfather fought in WW2 (idk where tho) and he got away from the front after he got shot where the heart is
Luckily for him he had his metallic box of tobacco right where he got shot so he stayed undamaged
I mean we lead a country that called itself holy ROMAN EMPIRE for one or two years
Non sugary food
The idea that all humans are equal no matter the race
Ha, I had an Santa Fe Superchief toy when I was a little kid so I fought US was the land of cool trains, the whole Western movies turning around trains and tracks didn't help to correct me
Some old songs should gave me a hint, "I'm the train called City of New Orleans, don't you know me, I'm your native son"...
*no matter the wallet
Lidl has the better meat selection though
I don't know, whenever I hear American political debates, everyone refers to Black people and White people and how they should be treated differently
This type of racial categorization is almost non-existent in Europe, at least in public discourse on television
Diesel
There are diesel locomotives all over Europe
>Why not usual gas, though
What
Why would anyone try to run a train with a gasoline motor since diesel was invented
Sweden still has diesel-electric locomotives in use as well
Range extender vehicles are somewhat similar in concept
Ever heard of mechanical efficiency
JuSt ShIfT gEaR lol
>I'm a mechanical engineer
A mechanical engineer who asked why trains aren't run by Otto engines
Just started your first year of your bachelor
>And if diesel is more energy dense, why don't we mainly use that in cars
Thats exactly what we do in Europe
more than half of new registered cars are Diesel
>I don't think scale is relevant, though
So whats your theory why pretty much every huge ship, electro-generators and trains are run with diesel
Or you know, like, maybe the highest effective efficiency of all combustion engines, low fuel costs, high energy density, good exhaust-emission behaviour and lack of high voltage electrical ignition system are some other compelling reasons

Fiaker (horse carriage) ride in Vienna
Just don't. Spend your money on food or museums instead
If you are in Vienna and you wanna go to a concert or the opera, don't by tickets from those guys running around dressed up like Mozart, in a baroque red jacket
They are usually next to the opera or next to St
Stephen's cathedral (tourist hot spots)
Those are not offical vendors, their tickets are not for the opera
It's usually a random orchestra in some random places (schools, rented gyms) playing those 2 Strauß pieces everybody knows, and that's it
For the low-tier experience that this is, you pay way too much
Last-minute opera tickets are available at the ticket office *in* the opera house at the left side entrance (you'll have to wait in line on time), and are quite cheap, other concert tickets at official vendors, usually at the respective houses, NEVER in the street
Also, don't take those horse carriages
They are really expensive and the horses barely have rights or good working conditions
If you really have to do a tour like that, take one of those electric cars in an old timey look, it's virtually the same, or take a hop-on-hop-off double-decker bus
Vienna:
City-Airport-Train - regular trains can be used fort like 1/5 of the price
Ring-Tram - see above
dudes in Mozart costumes selling concert tickets - mother of all scams, the concert is some random crap
legit concerts don't have their staff wear costumes
Wiener Wiesn - for some reason (aka money) Vienna decided to rip off Munichs Oktoberfest
the whole thing is tragic and its actually more expensive than the original in Germany
shame on everyone who goes there
double shame on the locals who go there
Plachutta, Figlmüller - two tourist trap restaurants who both claim to have the "best Schnitzel in town". if you fly into Vienna the arrival hall at the airport is plastered with advertisement from those two, which should make one think if they really are as authentic as they claim
any random restaurant will have quality Schnitzel
Cafe Sacher, Cafe Demel - I regularly see lines outside those two Cafes because they are so overrun by tourists who think they need to buy this one specific piece of cake because their travel guide told them to
first, Sachertorte is very dry and pretty shit
second, there is like a million cafes and bakeries everywhere, all of them offer amazing pastries
poor horses
No, Sachertorte is good, but you can get it everywhere
meh, its kind of boring and needs tons of cream as lube
the amount and variety of pastries and cakes are pretty much the best part of our cuisine by far, but for some reason this specific one gets basically all of the attention
I certainly wouldn't spend precious vacation time standing in line for it
Yes it does need a lot of cream, but it does taste good
Yes there are many good pastries and cakes here, but it is one of them
Yes it is stupid to stand in line for it, tourists should just get it somewhere else (you can get it in every café) if they want to try it
When it comes to universities
that you can get only jobs in the university if you are deep in somebody's ass
The two class system
If you fail to get into a Gymnasium after elementary school your life will change dramatically not only because you are in a objectively worst school but also bc your friend circle will be a lot different
Oh boy, my favorite topic lol
• The hours
Forcing 7 year olds to go to school in the afternoons is wild
Also, not even high school kids need to be in class after 4pm
It’s pretty impossible to learn anything after spending 8+ hours at school
• Teachers have way too much power
• Not enough time is spent on truly important things, instead we have art class, music class, PE and fucking RELIGION class
All things that should be completely optional after elementary school
(for example, if you can prove that you are part of a sports team etc
you should be able to drop the class at school)
• Unless you are middle of the road smart and middle of the road ambitious, you’re screwed
Having a hard time
So sorry, the system gives no fucks about you, go fail until you get sick of it and then go into a trade
You’re exceptionally gifted
Also sorry, here be bored for 12/13 years because there is no way to challenge you beyond the current curriculum
• Quality of schooling 100% depends on where you live and how good your teachers are
The curriculum is not truly enforced
There is no sort of quality control
Teachers can do the same shit for 20 years and people just go along with it, even if it’s complete bull
I could go on about this for HOURS
Our school system is built for mediocrity, awful for students with mental health issues or learning difficulties
There is no room for individuality or greatness, just like there is very little room for failure
And whether any of it was worth the struggle all hinges on ONE set of exams
If you’re not average and neurotypical, Austria‘s education system was not made for you
School until 19:00 O'Clock 4 times a week
We have a subject called "History and politics" but the politics part has been completely ignored
In the past five years that I've been attending my school, the teacher decided it would be more use to the students to know which pope lived in the 16th century rather than actually explaining politics to students who are reaching an age where they are allowed to vote for the first time amd have no clue who to vote for
It's not built around interests or skills, the people who can memorize stuff easier than others are good students, and a student who might be good at doing art and may not be as good at doing mathematics is considered a bad student just because art is not considered as important as mathematics
I've learned so much more about the English language through the internet than I ever will in my English class, my English teacher sometimes makes basic grammar mistakes and every lesson I'm just completely zoning out because everything my teacher is going to tell me, I already know
I'm just physically present but only because I have to, I don't think I've learned a single thing in those English lessons
We have to attend subjects that I am certain, we will never EVER think back to unless we are going in a very specific direction in our career
An example that fits me personally: Chemistry
I couldn't give two shits about chemistry, I am certain that I am never going to use it again but still I have to sit through all these boring ass classes, when I would much rather be doing something different that would actually help me pursue my dream career (that 100% will not have anything to do with chemistry)
This might be a thing at my school specifically, but some teachers just read entire pages of books and working sheets to their students
I just feel like they don't trust 18 year olds to be able to read
Plus, what do the students gain from the teacher just reading everything to them
I don't get it
The list goes on but I think this has been long enough
Edit: I forgot to mention that my English teacher talks to us in German most of the time
WHY THO
It is - but there are two different kinds of secondary school
Mittelschule and Gymnasium
One gives you the ability to go to university
The other doesn't ( only if you put in extra work and do a night-matura or go to a higher vocational school)
Not true at all
As long as you get into a high school and get a Matura of any sort, you can go to Uni, regardless of what you did from ages 10-14
HOWEVER, the education at a Neue Mittelschule is definitely not at the level of an average Gymnasium
i second this
Tbh, to make Gulasch authenic hungarian you just need to add wayyy to much Paprika and spice
It's not a copy, it's a different version (and there are at least 4 very different Gulasch variants in Austria)
The [Kruckenkreuz] symbol of the dictatorship 1933-1938
And no, it has nothing to do with the Nazis
However, the black white red is way cooler
The Arrow-cross is so ugly
It looks like the logo of a medium sized regional shipping company, owned by a guy named Laszlo
There actually is A LOT of austrian history in the interwar period that is often forgotten because of WW2
I mean, we had to figure out how to do this republic thing and voting, we had a very struggling economy, socialism started to take root in Vienna, we had a civil war, we had a fascist dictatorship
Even here, many people don't know very much about all that
No, not at all
That's what they're called
They tried to imitate Mussolini, the OG fascist
The ruling party in fact was very strongly anti-nazi
Many of them were put in concentration camps after the Anschluss
They were fascists trying to imitate Mussolini and not much better than the Nazis, but had nothing to do with the Nazis
I like it
It looks much better than the Dutch flag
It's a really fascinating time in our history, to be honest
The Schlossmuseum in Linz had a really cool exhibition about it until last year
There is so much we either don't learn or that gets glossed over
> Seriously people I'm just a fan of /r/vexillology, not a nazi
FYI those two things do not necessarily exclude one another
>  The St George's Cross in England generally either means a sporting event is on, like the World Cup, or the person flying it is quite right wing
*looks at flair*
Isn't Franco's grandson flying the fascist flag on his house
I remember seeing it on TV when they removed the body from the Valle de los Caidos
Yeah, exactly
What happened here between the wars had very little impact on the rest of the world, and it's easily overshadowed by 1938-1945
So of course it's not really taught elsewhere
I still think it's fascinating
I personally am quite interested in the [Red Vienna] period, how it came to be, what they accomplished and how it impacts our lives in Vienna until today
Fun fact: We still have the longest residential building in the world
The Karl Marx Hof, a prestigious municipal housing complex from that period
(The Wikipedia page for longest buildings is misleading, they measure around corners too)
Dollfuss was around 1,50 and got a nickname for that: millimetternich
"Bluatschilling" basically you sat down as a group and had to keep a coin spinning
If the coin stopped spinning or fell off the table, the last person that had to spin it had to put his knuckles on the table and got the coin flicked at his knuckle by each person in the group
We had a lot of bloody knuckles at that time
My friends and I still do that today lmao

Germany just for how they pronounce things
The farther northwest you go the bigger the grievances
Might even bring them to court for continued verbal cruelty
And almost everybody else around us for using nuclear power and building plants close to our border
Only redeeming point about Germans that they decided to shut theirs down
But that really does not solve the cruel distortion of their pronounciation
Thats for taking Silesia and for what you are doing to our common language
Looking forward to the times when Austrian will be like a second Dutch language
Well you include parts of Austria in your greater Hungary/St

I am a big supporter of minority rights regardless and wouldn’t mind a regional economical self-governance for the area which is overwhelmingly Hungarian, if that’s really what they want for the territory they live on
However, even now, they have every right imaginable for a minority
Schools in all stages solely in Hungarian, public institutions ranging from the town hall to courthouses, cultural associations, tv/radio/news, shops, etc
They can just go about their lives and not hear Romanian for weeks
The only right they don’t and can’t have is to live in Hungary right where they are
I'm a German living in Austria and I'm already on it
good idea - i mean we could do it but then no one north of the Danube would be able to pronounce it
Sounds like a deal to me
I know for a fact that a lot of Romanians in Transylvania that have to deal with Hungarians daily would be mostly ok with this
The ones that are the most vocal against autonomy are the people in Bucharest, who have never seen a Hungarian in flesh their whole lives, let alone visited Székely Land or know some real history apart from propaganda
Ähm I might be mistaken but I think there actually is something called ‚Austrian German‘, at least my dictionary says there is
[Mensch Ärger dich nicht] ist the local Pachisi game variant
Fuchs und Henne the local fox game variant
"Mühle" is Nine man's Morris
[DKT] has an interesting history
It's original name was Spekulation and is based like Monopoly on the landlords game
But it was renamed after the Anschluss because Monopoly was already banned for beeing to Jewish
They renamed it to "Das kaufmännische Talent"
"Leiterspiel" is the local snakes and Ladders, popular with kids
Speaking of a kids game, ["Tempo kleine Schnecke"] is not that old (from the 80's) but as it's easy to play every kindergarten and day care has it since then
Jassen
It's a game with cards
I forgot the last game existed until just now
Brought back some memories
Thank you for posting this, honestly
Guilt edition
lol (Can't watch the vid :()
I think our 2nd and 3rd biggest cities, Graz and Linz respectively, are generally more unknown than our 4th and 5th biggest, Salzburg and Innsbruck
I always say that Klagenfurt is our biggest city nobody knows about
Most people know our Top5 (by population): Vienna, Graz, Linz, Salzburg, Innsbruck
Klagenfurt is the 6th biggest and many people outside Austria have never heard of it
I don‘t know how well our federal state capitals are known, but maybe those
Idk how many people know about Linz, St
Pölten, Graz, Eisenstadt, Salzburg, Klagenfurt, (Lienz,) Innsbruck and Bregenz
I think Salzburg, Innsbruck and Linz are the more well known bunch of those
Pölten is also pretty well forgotten
Makes sense
Both Linz and Graz are quite uninteresting compared to Salzburg and Innsbruck
I was born and raised 5km from the Czech/Polish border (I'm Polish) and we made trips to Ostrava every other weekend to do some window-shopping
The city isn't breathtaking tbh (just like any other Silesian city), but it's quite a big one that everybody around here knows, because it's closer than Katowice and has almost as many shopping centres
Every Austrian who has a 24 hours nurse/caregiver knows about Kosice
Hey, I stayed shortly in Waterford last time I was in Ireland
Linz, Lienz, Liezen, take your pick
They often get confused with ech other
Lienz is barely a town to be fair
Yeah, they stripped it of its Schwarzenegger name back when he was governor and signed execution orders of death row inmates
I wish I could forget St
Pölten
Please teach me, foreigners
Pölten deserves to be forgotten
Pölten has a population of about 7
I mean most 10th biggest cities (especially of smaller European countries) are rather obscure
Of course, since you live right next to Carinthia/Koroška that doesn't really apply to you
Just like Hungarians probably have heard of Eisenstadt but our other neighbours haven't
These fuckers kill more people than guns, that's how delicious they are
Was born and grew up there, can confirm :( All there is is tourism and some industry, that's it
Ear plugs for the first hour whenever you take a train west from Vienna help somewhat
Austrians are in general quite bad at geography
Three towns in Germany
Berlin, Cologne, Munich
They should manage that
In Italy
After Rome and Lignano, they might remember Pisa or Bologna or Naples
For any other neighbouring country I'd say "no chance that a majority of Austrians can name three towns".
It could be Bucharest
Technicly all the answers here are wrong since the official name was never austria-hungary (in german: österreich-ungarn) but "the kingdoms and lands represented in the imperial council and the lands of the holy hungarian crown of st
Stephens" (but in hungarian and german)
But i can understand why everyone calls it austria-hungary
Österreich-Ungarn
What we getting taught in school: *Doppelmonarchie Österreich-Ungarn*
Not my native languages, but I thought I could add two interesting ones:
Indonesian: Kekaisaran Austria-Hongaria
Japanese: オーストリア＝ハンガリー帝国 (Ōsutoria-Hangarii teikoku)
"ungern" ist actually pretty funny
K.u.k. is an adjective/prefix applied to various things, not an informal name for the Country
I.e. K.u.k. Monarchie for the monarchy itself, or K.u.k. Hoflieferant for companies that were chosen to deliver to the royal court (which was a huge badge of honour and proof of quality)
So English is your language
&#x200B;
I'm pretty sure Österreich-Ungarn would be better here
There needs to be a hyphen: Österreich**-**Ungarn
He decided this name will be the official name in international relations
Thats far from an official name of the country itself
Most nation nowadays use there english name in foreign relations, that doesn't change the fact that the official name stays the one in the native language
I imagine tourists taking a walk on a sunny summer day when suddenly from the woods they hear yodeling: "What are you doing in my ALPS
Ungarn hungern ungern
He asked how the name of austria hungary is translated and technicly the name is the one i mentioned above (just in german and hungarian) so they have to translate the above
56% of our people voted for far right parties
When
And I would only call the FPÖ far right
The old ÖVP was right
The new one is far right
I disagree but respect your position
We agree on disagreeing
Constitution laws are changed all the time
They need 2/3rd of votes in parliament to add or alter a constitution law
For decades our big parties have added all kinds of irrelevant legislation to the consitution
In some cases they knew that what they wanted was probably unconstitutional so they added it directly to the constitution
The heart piece of our constitution has never been changed since 1920 afaik
I would say the changing of the B-VG for joining the EU would be considered a change of the "heart piece" as it was a so called "Gesamtänderung der Verfassung" in 1994 and therfore needed a referendum
> The heart piece of our constitution has never been changed since 1920 afaik
[Except for a significant amendment in 1929] which significantly weakened the role of the parliament
Another input from me: You might want to distinguish between the constitution itself (which mainly is the B-VG and the StGG 1867) and laws that have constitutional rank
(Gesetze im Verfassungsrang)
The last ones are simply laws that were pushed into constitutional rank by special quorum (and also by naming it to be in constitutional rank) but I wouldn´t consider them to be the "constitution" itself
So they were not "added" to the constitution technically, they were just "elevated" into constitutional rank to have special protection from being changed (and to make it impossible for the VfGH to overrule them)
Also the way the president gets elected

We love using this word to throw off foreigners
oachkatzl is the animal, but its tail is called oachkatzlschwoaf
In some alpine parts of Austria ( Bavaria I assume too) we call it "Oachkatzl". Oach is the dialekt word for Eiche, and Katzl means cat
Austro-Bavarian has some surprising similarites to English sometimes
Eiche -> Oach -> oak
That's fucked up
This has to do with Catalonia right
The first 3 points probably come down to their own history with Basque or Catalan independence
In Finland they managed to build a safe storage for nuclear waste

As an austrian, I don't put them in the fridge
Fridge
As with cheese and milk
In the fridge, both in stores and at home
I always put them in the fridge
In the supermarket I usually go to theyre in the fridge as well
I eat 7-8 eggs daily and my blood is fine
I don't use any oil and very little to non salt, sometimes cooked, sometimes scrambled
LDL in eggs is not linked with a higher LDL/HDL ratio and the ratio is what matters
I even read a study which also mentioned a 80-90 year old man who eats 25 eggs daily for most of his life and his cholesterol was normal
My LDL is 100 mg/dl and my HDL is 50 mg/dl
So a total of 150 which is very good and a ratio of 2:1 which is also good
Maybe you just ate other unhealthy food
1) if the smoking ban should be implemented or not (bring it on finally
2) if traditional winefarmer's eateries (Heurige) serve only cold cuts with table service (of course) or also hot food buffet-style (heresy)
3) in cities: if parking fees should be introduced and parking space managed/limited, or not (parking fees and city toll, bring it on baby
Whether the orange or green part of a Twinni (very popular popsicle) is better
This is for all German speakers, not only Austria: what you call the "safe zone" when you play tag (fangenspielen)

In Austria, "I am from Austria" from Reinhard Fendrich
It always happens
That song made my heart skip beats when playing in the national stadium
I'm really spoiled with my countries location, I could go anywhere without being bothered by taking the train
The federal railway is planning to expand it's night train network further in the next couples of years and I'm very pleased with it
When traveling with train is either too expensive or it takes longer than a 24h day
When the trains don‘t go straight there (from an Austrian city)
Like how trains go directly from Vienna to Slovakia, but I highly doubt that there are trains going from any Austrian city to eg Norway without having to switch trains at least once
Or another explanation: Neighbouring states by train, anything else I‘d tell people to take a plane
Price and availability of overnight trains for longer distance stuff
Spending a whole day in a train can be nice, but it gets less and less exciting very fast if it essentially means that your 2 week holiday lasts only 12 days
From Vienna for example I would say the limit for trains is about Belgium in one trip
I'd take trains to about Luxembourg but probably not to Brussels (depending on connections etc
I guess some high speed routes could widen this to some degree, but I'm not sure if getting from Vienna to e.g. Lisbon for let's say ~200€ in current purchasing power in one night by train is realistic any time soon
Towards the south-east and Balkans the issue is rather with non-availability of trains (buses are king there)
Everything over 8 hours by train (or a lot of changing trains) I'll take the plane
Yes it is
>have the Swiss be in charge of it
Have the Austrians in charge
Extremely reliable and reasonably priced at the same time
It has a few different branches but it tends to be a center right approach to centrist approach with christian trade unions
At it's core is the concept of subsidiarity with selfresponsibility at it's core
And from there everyone has a responsibility for the common good, starting at the family, through the cocal community up to the state level and beyond
Where there is equality and solidarity on the left, there is responsibility for oneself and others in christian democracy
Sometimes this leads to very similar results, sometimes they are completly at odds
What do the movies misportray about your country
As strange as it may sound, austria isn't just one big mountain as some seem to think
And not everyone lives in a chalet and eats schnitzel or something like that every day
I'm told the sound of music is a crappy depiction of Austria, but I haven't seen it
Other movies don't really portrait us at all
(A standard Austrian chancellor appears in MI, but he could have been from anywhere
Lederhosen are generally not worn in everyday life
It’s the same in German - what pisses me of most is that they don’t even get the declensions and conjugations rights - it’s not “ja meine Herr die Auto ist da” it’s “ja mein Herr das Auto ist da” - I mean - I don’t expect a translator to go through every movie script but I am sure there are enough native german speakers in Hollywood that this can be solved with a simple phone call

Before Elementary school
My kids learned it between 3 and 4, they had those pedal less bikes before I guess those helped them with the balance
6-7 too, don't remember well
&#x200B;
Not driving people includes too young, too old, too fat, and/or (other) medical conditions
But other than that, I don't know anyone who can't.
I had a small pink Tom&Jerry bike
My older siblings had already learned how to ride on that bike, and I think the bike is still circulating somewhere in the extended family
First I rode it with side wheels, then by papa took them off one day and held me, until he didn't hold me anymore in one moment, and that's how I rode the bike
I think I was 4 or 5
Of course I also fell multiple times, but I don't have clear memories of that
I think nowadays it's more common that kids have those training bikes were they don't have to use pedals yet, but can learn how to hold the balance
Instead of side wheels
My 3 year old niece already can go around 10 meters on a regular bike because of that, it's very impressive
I think most people here can ride a bike and children are allowed to participate in traffic with 12 years, 10 years if they do a kind of "driving license". I remember I did that in school, a police officer came to school, we did a theoretical multiple choice test about traffic rules and certain traffic signs that are relevant for bike and foot traffic ("give way", "STOP" etc), and had a practical test (hand signs, looking for traffic correctly, taking a left turn etc
We had a "freshing up" of that theoretical knowlege with 11 and 12 years, also in school
Of course, cause that's how literally everybody ever learned how to ride a bike as a kid
1880s Austria as a city builder/tycoon game

„Tschusch“ in Austria
But a Tschusch can also be everyone else living in South Eastern Europe except of ex Yugoslavia, those people are called „Jugos“
Here in Austria its basically the same
Almost only about the nsdap, the holocaust and the Anschluss
We learned a little bit about the war, like the battle of France, operation Barbarossa etc
But almost nothing else about the Military factor
Same
HOLOCAUSTHOLOCAUSTHOLOCAUST for at least a whole year
You make it sound like that's a bad thing
Considering our current politics it probably should be taught even more extensively tbh
I'd say learning about our many attrocities is much more important than individual battles but alright
I'm pretty sure there are many FPÖ voters who wouldn't mind that, yes
Its not like they wouldn't do it
They just (currently) can't do it
Well we thoroughly learn about those as well obviously
We thoroughly learned about the events and reasons leading to that horrible shitshow as well obviously
The Austro-Hungarian Empire
I admit, access to the Adriatic sea would be pretty dope
Mostly 1934-1945 for the hardcore nationalists
Especially the period of 1938-1945
When it comes to less disgusting nationalists appreciating Austria and not the Ostmark its mostly the reign of Franz Joseph, and especially the Gründerzeit which gets romanticised
Chicken definitely is the most popular poultry meat, both in traditional cuisine as well as everyday cooking
Turkey is very common too, though people mostly just use the breast meat
Actual whole roasted turkey is very rare
Goose is mostly something for special occasions, for example [St Martin's Day] Duck is somewhat similar - unless you include Asian cuisine, then it's quite common since nearly every Chinese or Asian fusion restaurant and takeaway will offer some variety of crispy duck
As for the much more uncommon poultry options, there's quail or gamebirds such as pheasant and partridge
The meat is usually pricey though, so it's more of a gourmet food thing and not something for everyday cooking
And for the non-native option, we do have a bunch of ostrich farms in Austria, if you want to classify those as poultry
But this is also more of a fancy gourmet food thing
St Martins
We've got Martinigansl too :)
I never saw pidgeon around here either tbh
[Wels
] It's boring, ugly and insignificant
For some reason, this reminds me of the movie 'Yellow Submarine', during (or around) the time when *Eleanor Rigby* is played
Thank you
I was looking for the Austrian comment, fearing somebody would write something other than Wels
Wels is indeed a horrible horrible city
I hate it with a passion
Literally the only redeeming thing about it is that old tower, and that's it
I always say that every city has its bad districts while Wels as a whole is the bad district
I also like to say that Wels is like somebody would've cut out the bad parts of Linz and made it its own city
And like philzebub666 already said: Attnang Puchheim is the small version of Wels
I realize I apparently have a strong aversion against those two cities
Attnang-Puchheim is even worse in my opinion
>I also like to say that Wels is like somebody would've cut out the bad parts of Linz and made it its own city
As a Linzer, I gotta say that is an apt description
>I realize I apparently have a strong aversion against those two cities
You have every right
They are just terrible
That whole area along Traun and Ager, between Marchtrenk and Attnang-Puchheim is terrible
And Wels is the pinnacle of that area
I've been to Winterthur once, it wasn't that bad in my opinion
Pölten is also a strong contender
I've never been there but isn't St
Pölten only boring amd not ugly
I'm tyrolian and I feel like all the other Austrians like my accent as it is quite harsh and sounds a bit brutal, compared to the eastern Austrian dialects
People from northern and central Germany probably just see me as a peasant if I'd talk in dialect with them, as they won't understand anything
I would say that as soon as I arrive at the southern border of Munich, I have to speak standard german
Otherwise no one understands me
For sure
I get shit from other German speakers because of my dialect and from my international friends for my accent when speaking English
All in good spirits though
I sound a bit slow when I speak standard german
Its just because the harsher sounds of Hochdeutsch just don't lend themselves well to what my tongue is used to, and I have to on-the-fly translate some words and phrases that are not normally used in standard german
So, of course, this leads to Germans often making fun of it
I don't feel like they "mock" me, but occasionally my Southern Upper Austrian dialect comes through quite heavily so then I've got to tone it down a bit to be understood correctly
Recently was at a party in Berlin and they found my accent charming, so there's that

Why would you say that your dialekhkht sounds harsh-kh
Can confirm: am from "eastern Austria" and love the dialects in Tyrol
I wouldn't say that it's just because it sounds "brutal" though
That's one part maybe, but it's not the first thing that comes to mind when I hear it
I honestly don't ckhknow :D
If you rise the sea level by 900 meters austria would become a island group but still exist to 50% but 99% of germany would disapear
I see this as an absolut win
I think if the sea rises 900m we have bigger problems then a few germans moving to austria
Das/dass, seid/seit are mistakes easily made, but the only thing that drives me crazy are certain English grammatical rules invading the German language, like writing words apart and apostrophes
So the other day some people had a political discussion and someone came to the defense of a certain vice chancellor and he used the word "Bevölkerungs Austausch", more like "Gehirn Austausch", am I right
And you can very easily write German until the day you die and not use a single apostrophe ever, it is especially not used in the possessive form
Ever
That's the same as lie/lay and sit/set, isn't it
I think every Germanic language has them
yes, the good old *Idiotenapostroph*
Ah okay
Yeah, it's the same in German
I am in Engineering and my internships paid 1200-2000€ per month

For pensions I don't really know how it works, sorry
What are some funny movie translations from english into your native language, or vice versa
For example, in german the movie "Die Hard" is called "Stirb Langsam" which translates to "Die Slowly"
> Die Bart, die
doesn't really make any sense in German any more
Translating is Mega Hard you know
>"Despicable Me"
We just translated it into "i - Simply Incorrigible ", but ngl "I'm a little bastard" wins this
Well it can be a family activity if you really want
Many fans will never forgive Netflix for "Money Heist
" At least in German they translated it to "Haus des Geldes" which I can get on board with, even if it loses some of it with only being "house of money
Nice translation that is, in german it's "Das Schicksal ist ein mieser Verräter" which means "Fate is a lousy traitor"
Monty python and the holy grail: Ritter der Kokosnuss which translates to Knights of the coconut
Apparently we couldn't pun on "High Noon" either and just called it "Shang-High-Noon"
Yeah makes sense
ich is I in English

Nope, never

(It was definitely malicious, not a honest mistake
And while that offer can be an advantage for customers, it's only under very specific conditions, and in my case only the bank would have profited from it)
Didn't sign it anways and switched banks soon after (and because many people were dissatisfied and leaving, this particular branch of the old bank closed 2 years after that)

-My deck of Yu-Gi-Oh cards was stolen in school when I was 12
Someone once broke the front door lock trying to break into my parents' house
Didn't get in though
About 15 years ago, my mother had her wallet stolen while in Madrid for work
I once broke into my own apartment after locking myself out
Other than that, no
Burglar broke into house once, I think that might be the worst one because you don't feel safe in your own home anymore
Also I got my Phone stolen, Bicycle stolen, got beaten up once
Also just yesterday my wallet was stolen
-\_-
It's a lot of bad luck I guess, in general it is really safe here
Just saying, robbing and stealing is a difference
Ehrenmann
Sandu Ciorba - Pe cimpoi
If you‘ve ever been in the weird part of the internet in the last few years, there‘s a high chance you already know it
Honorary mention, of course: O-zone - Dragostea din tei
And before our eastern brothers start commenting, yes, I know the song is actually moldovan
Dragostea din tei is one of the biggest bangers of all time
Well then ... nobody is stopping them from going home to their beloved Führer
That is not "super advanced", that is completely normal
Looking up and down my street at the moment and there are only two windows that aren't like these and that house looks like it will be torn down soon
While I don't try out any window I see, I know exactly one that is not like that - it was built in more than 70 years ago
So, I'd say very common here
Browsing some websites of companies gives the same impression, I don't see any single-direction ones
Ordering Windows that are not like that will probably be more expensive because they don't make it otherwise (if they accept such requests at all)
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Normal windows since the 80s
Currently living in France (> 1 year), it's possible to get them but they arn't popular
Instead people have horizontally opening windows and exterior shutters
I often wish we had up-down-slide-windows because installing and aftermarket AC is so much easier with them - and quite frankly, the summer in Vienna is so hot that you really start to need an AC to cool your flat down below 30° C
[We have to deal with abominations like this]
I would guess they are the norm since about 40-50 years, it is really rare to see any house without these (unless there's a good reason of course to not have them, like a sliding door)
I have never seen anything like it in Brazil
Just moved to Austria and found these windows very clever
How do you clean the leftmost and rightmost windows on the outside if that's in the first floor instead of on the ground floor
They must really hate those old windows
Haha those were awesome, I think I remember one where that lever actually shifted the window over in the frame instead of disengaging a bolt
But that must have been from the late 70s (i.e. was already old when I was a child in the 90s)
trucker Cassie is pretty cool
I like that one too
I quite enjoy Michael Buchinger's monthly "Hassliste" (he's very good at ranting and being humorous while doing it)
If I were from Germany I would have said Coldmirror as well, glad to see that people still love her videos
Tapakapa
Makes interesting drawn videos about random stuff
Also, I have a love-hate for Michael Buchinger
Which is quite fitting tbh
Also Maschek and Peter Klien, but that's conrent primarly produced for TV
Tapakapa
Also things that are on youtube but are no youtubers like peter klien
There are people named "furze"? Lol
Agree
I also like JanaKlar
Etzala fliegst du
MaiLab is undoubtedly one of my favorite channels a d is probably the channel people are missing out on most
Well, next to Coldmirror, that is
DIE BÜESTE
I will definitely do that
100% the norm, formal and informal
Yes it's pretty common and expected to shake hands when you meet
Depending on the social circle: very common even among friends
Although it should be added there's a range, it goes from the famed "shake everybody's hand once you arrive and don't forget anybody" to "oh we normally just wave in the general direction of people and hug our closest friends". I've noticed it is more common among younger people (<40) who grew up in Vienna and who might have picked up on Turkish customs in school (heavy conjecture); seems not to be as prevalent among younger people who moved to the capital for studying or work
Also Northerners tend to hug more than shake hands, I think
Traditional locals who grew up on the countryside are more reserved than all of that, they would often just nod or wave at people
Oh and all that is for up to the millennial generation, can't really say how it is among groups of older people (40+)
It's common for men and women
With close friends as well
Think of a normal handshake
I personally never do that, we always either use informal shakes (like half-high five or double-shake, I don't know whats the proper word) or do a half-hug
Or if it's a big group, just a nod or a wave
Cats, most people I know have had pet cats before so there's that
I like cats
I think Austria is pretty 50/50 on this, maybe with a slight preference towards cats bc everybody I know had at least one cat (or no pet at all)
Europe I think is pretty dog-person
Personal: Cats
National: Kinda both
Continental: Both I think
And I thought I was the only crazy person doing this
Thank you for being such a caring and wonderful person :)
Burgenland Croatian, it's the language of the Croatian people a Hungarian magnat invited to settle on the land the Ottomans devastated during the siege of Vienna
The land they settled became after the first WW Ro Austria
Nowadays it's a special protected language, where it's taught in schools where the majority of the ancestors of those people live
[I love Platt]
You forgot Aranés, a Gascon dialect of Occitan spoken by a few thousand people in the Val d'Aran in Catalonia
Mea culpa
Oh boy, we have a lot of unknown companies in Austria that are actually pretty big in their sector
Let's start with ZKW, they produce LED and matrix lighting, especially for BMW for example
Then we have Rosenbauer, they are the biggest fire truck manufacturer in the world
Of course we have a lot of ski industry companies, Doppelmayr for example is one of the biggest ski lift producers worldwide
Then we have Peak Technology, they are currently creating a heat resisting shielding for the European space agency, in the past they also worked with NASA
Böhler Udeholm and Voest Alpine are big players in Steel Business
Andritz is big in powerplant business, from turbines and generators
AVL List is quiet large into engine Research and produceing test Equipment and powertrains
Rosenberger produces fire Trucks and Special utility vehicles
Rotax produces 2 and 4 Stroke engines, mainly for Bombardier, but also other Businesses
Edit: Nokia sells directly to their customers, I've bought a Phone from their Website ;)
Never know ASML was Dutch
"Alpla" : apparently they are among the world leading companies in plastic packaging
Especially plastic bottles are their main field
"Magna" : very big automobile manufacturer, I think mainly Mercedes and BMW are its customers in Austria
The company is half Canadian, so not purely Austrian
It was founded by an Austrian who went to Canada and later merged with a Canadian company
there is a head office in Austria and several factories, thats why many consider it as an Austrian company
And I would throw "Rauch" into the discussion
The are well known as B2C in Austria for a variety of fruit juices and ice tea
But what a lot of people don't know is that they produce Redbull and sell it to - of course - Red bull
Red bull does the marketing and sell it internationally
* Plasser & Theurer make rail track laying machines
* Frequentis makes air traffic control systems
* ISI Group makes CO2 capsules for airbages, fire extinguishers, emergency rafts and emergency slides and whipped cream
* Lenzing has gotten some attention lately, but they're also huge in their domaine
* Palfinger is one of the biggest makers of truck cranes
* RHI makes fire proof building materials
* Greiner AG makes lots of stuff from plastic
I'd like to add two
Wienerberger - world's biggest manufacturer of bricks and roof tiles
Also producing pavers and piping systems
Ams Ag - Microchip company, specialized in optical sensors
Apple Face ID totally depends on their sensors
Last year they bought the german lighting giant OSRAM
> Doppelmayr
they also made the longest cable car in the world in Phu Quoc if I am not mistaken
I would add Voest Alpine to that
Vorarlberg seems to punch way above it's weight
We also have with *Wolfram* one of the biggest producers of the element wolfram/tungsten
Oh and *Glock*, but i'm not sure that qualifies as unknown
Dont forget the "ams AG". If you own an iPhone, you probably have one of their sensors in it
The are one of the leading high-accuracy low power sensor producers
Andritz is huge and mostly unknown too
> Doppelmayr for example is one of the biggest ski lift producers worldwide
In what world is Doppelmayr unknown to the general public
I would totally add "Blum" to it
They make hinges and other stuff for kitchen manufacturers and you find them pretty much in every kitchen
I had never heard of them until they nearly became a customer of ours
I was suprised about the size of the company
From personal experience I would add "Wittmann-Battenfeld".
Producing Injections Molds, Automation Robots and other equipment for producing all sorts of plastics and synthetics
FN sells to consumers and is quite well known though
> ThyssenKrupp
People do not know them
Their elevators and escalators are pretty common
>Schenker (logistics)
You see the trains and trucks everywhere
Talking about Heidelberg, Unzer, formerly called Heidelpay
One of the the biggest credit card payment  processors in europe, after buying much of the competition like Austrian mPay
Thought the same :D. Not that I begrudge them
They make quality products, so why not advertise that
But everybody who owns a pair of skis probably knows them
They also installed a ski lift in North Korea
I think Glock is the complete opposite of unknown
However most people probably don't know that they are based in Austria
Oh, i know some people working there, they hate the puns with their company name (AMS is also called the unemployment Agency Here for None Austrians)
Always thought Infineon was Austrian, but it seems they are German but have their production Sites here
ZF is from Germany though
Is it so strange that when NK wants a ski lift, they get an well-known ski lift company to do it
>However most people probably don't know that they are based in Austria
It's very prominently Austrian
Even Americans know its from Austria (even when they wouldn't be able to point at Austria on a map)
Well that backfired
No it's interesting how they got a Austrian company to do it even tough there was a trade embargo at that time
It is not just a German thing but there are a lot more of these companies in Germany than in most other countries
It could be that most of these companies are founded and run by a family that were formerly trade people
From my point of view Craftsmanship and trade is more institutionalised in german speaking countries and therefore they don't want to sell their company to a bigger one, because they "know what they are doing" compared to a ceo with just an economics background
Or it could be that all the smaller companies dream of becoming Bosch one day
They still don't contribute to the stock market and are just run by one family
I'm not reliant on a car in daily life and mostly use my bike or public transport
I wouldn't want to live without a driver's licence though
I drive a lot when on my travels or weekend trips
I'd have missed the most beautiful places and scenes in my life without a car
When exploring (whether it's the surroundings or another country), public transport is inadequate
Also, it's nice to be able transport larger items without a hassle or to rent an Ikea truck to move homes
Yes and no
I have a kid and I have a busy life, so when I am in Berlin, yes
Vienna is another story, because my apartment is on the canal facing the most central district so I can almost walk everywhere
Weekend and day trips out of the city still require the use of my car, though and my husband also had a car
Yep
I live in Vienna and I sometimes drive to other cities/villagers per train
I don't need a car license
I will do one if I need it
If you are under 15, you cannot ride your bike without an adult, unless you got a bike license
Same here
Arnold Schwarzenegger is glad that you specified the type of oak
The Styrian Oak would care
The point is tha Balkan carries cultural weight
It is not a purely geographic definition, it is more akin to say a state is deep south in the US or dixie
You will get a bunch of oppinions that may vary over time and shift
The Balkans is where two big christian churches clashed with Islam, where Empires and nations influenced by western, eastern European and the muslim world met and mixed
A region that saw very different influences and in which very difficult nation forming happened in the 19th and 20th century
So as there is no clear set border of what Europe is, there is no clear border on what the Balkans as a region are
>We learned that the balkans are bordered by the Mediterranean, Marmara sea, and Black Sea
North border is the Danube and Sava river
So technicallly only half of Croatia is in it
The definition isn't as clear in real life
Yes, you can just learn the borders of the Balkan peninsula, but the cultural/political definition of the Balkan is not as clearly defined
The whole discussion in this thread isn't as much about geography as it is about politics and culture
Homestly no, Greece does not come to my mind when thinking about Balkan
There is a saying in western Austria, the Balkan starts in Vienna
Viennese say it starts in the 16th district
On a serious note there is the distinction between West Balkans which mainly is former Yugoslavia and Albania maybe minus Slovenia and estern Balkan that is oriented towards the black sea
But then again, what is Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe not even the Scandinavians can sort out what ultimatly encompasses their region
The geographic term is well defined, but Balkan is more a cultural concept around here, associated with music, food, ethnicities, culture etc
Vienna has quite sizeable communities from most of the Balkan states, so for many people it is also back home or their families place
It carries weight
Of my direct four neighbours one are a croat couple another a mixed austrian/serb one
The first documented mention of Austria dates back to 980ish
Houses from the 1800s are quite common everywhere and quite a few across Austria are (at least in part) considerably older
We have numerous Roman sites (Vindobona, Aguntum, Carnuntum even had a miniature Collosseum), Celtic sites, dating back a few thousand of years, also pretty much all over the country
Salt minery has been big in western Austria for thousands of years too, creating massive wealth during the bronze and/or iron age
And of course one of the most famous mummies "Oetzi" is some 5 thousand years old
So yeah, there's been a lot going on here and there's written history if a lot of it, much of it due to the fact that we were center to the Habsburg Empire
Only Thing people I know found by digging around are Nazi stuff (I know two people who found a SS dagger in their Field) and Unexploded ordnance
My town's history goes back quite some time
It's happened a few times that construction work had to be stopped because they dug up some old structures or artifacts that then needed to be evaluated by archeologists and historians
I once had a side job on one of those archeological digs on a construction site right in the middle of town
It was mostly stuff from the 16th to 18th century, but while we were working there we also found some pottery shards in the deeper layers that were around 2000 years old, which was a minor archeological surprise
The shards are thought to be proof that this region had very early settlements
Depending on where you live, it's very very easy
Example: I live in the 3rd district of Vienna
If I walk down my street there's [a carpentry] at the corner, in a half basement
When they built the house in 1910, they found copper melting ovens in the floor of this half basement, as well as old roof tiles
The age of those ovens and tiles was around 2000 years
So there was a Roman metal working facility there
The Romans stayed there until around the 4th century, then the *Quadi* came and fucked shit up
The facility burned down around that time
My whole neighbourhood actually is a historic area as there was not only a Roman civilian settlement for a long time (right outside of the military city Vindobona, now in the 1st district of Vienna), but before that it had been a Celtic settlement since the Bronze Ages
But not only my neighbourhood, is like that
In the center ofc there was Vindobona, so they find a lot of stuff there always, and west of that was another civilian settlement
So whenever they dig up something, or build new houses anywhere in those areas of Vienna, they find some antique shit, and then a team of archeologists come and take a look at it
[City Hall has its own team of archeologists] They find interesting stuff beginning from the late neolithicum until the most recent decades
But since you can't reconstruct a Celtic/Roman city on top of a living contemporary city, they are doing it virtually
Every little piece they find in some construction site hole, completes the puzzle a bit more
Right now they are building a new subway line, and expand another, inlcuding a big station where both lines will cross
That is a huge deal for those archeologists
&nbsp;
As for my hometown Linz, it's very similar really
Also lots of Celtic and Roman stuff
Like, [there's this little earth wall/ rampart] in a park on a hill, right next to the old city center
The rampart looks like a natural hill, but really it's an artificial earth wall that was constructed by some Celts ~3000 years ago
They had a kind of earth, wood, and brick made castle up there, but it burned down at some point
Well, I live near a road that has gotten its name because there were a lot of ancient roman coins found there
Our oldest documented building in town was built sometime before 1164 and the oldest church, along with a castle were built in 1438
This castle and church are standing to this day
We had a castle at the city center built in the 13th century but it was destroyed by the french in the 19th century, except for two buildings
&#x200B;
Also, in my state, we regularly find old roman artifacts, and a couple of years ago they found some roman ruins near our airport
When in Rome
Hate to be the nitpicker, but isn't that an artefact
The German word for bunker is Bunker
Blockhaus is a house made from blocks of wood
Its also rarely used as a special kind of small military building
We learn about the different institutions of the EU in the Gymnasium, when students are between 14 and 18 Years old
There are entire chapters dedicated to it in history and geography class
I would say our educational system is in tune with the europeam elections as well
Same here
Specialiced on European institutions and policy making in my studies before I vered to general public management
Hadn't I been interested in the topic in school beforehand I would not have known anything but the most basic stuff
But that's also due to Austria joining the EU only a few years before I finished school so most teachers were completly clueless about it
But I doubt that it changed too much as schools in Austria are generally bad on teaching people basic stuff on any political institution - many people are clueless about political and state institution in general not just the EU
My experience was pretty different from yours
We learned about the institutions, how they are made up, what their job is etc
Of course we didn't go into the hard details of how the EU works, but its fair to say that we knew:
* What the institutions, such as the Court of the EU, the parliament etc
are and what they are responsible for
* How they are elected/formed
* How the EEA (Switzerland and Norway) fit into the picture
* The history of the EU, starting at WW2
* Some stuff that was important at the time
Which basically comes down to TTIP/CETA and why the EU is responsible for trade in the first place as well as the refugee crisis
So yeah, definitely enough to get by I would say
Edit: I went to a "Gymnasium" and then a "HTL", just in case this makes a difference
I went to a Gymnasium then HAK
We actually had 2 hours of civic education, which was a jokebin retrospect
But that was very much the teachers fault
I think that was in 1998
Only thing we got into any detail was the currency union but that was in our economics class
But I am happy if it has changed to the better
To be honest looking back at my time in school I am surprised how much special knowledge and trivia they teached us, while omitting the basic stuff it built on
IMHO many things were never of any use as they had ecome obsolete by the time we left school
It is too often teaching to then test meaningless trivia, while omiting real capacity building
Cash or per App
Or in a ticket shop in advance, where they take everything
I like the ÖBB app for train travel
For small bus trips I prefer cash, when I commuted I paid a half year card in advance
App usually
Online, with card in the shops and in cash
I prefer the online method
Cost are 365€ per year for the whole city (Bus, Tramways and Metro/Underground) (!! I THINK, I COULDN'T FIND THE ACTUAL PRICES but that is what I remember !!)
70€ a year for students with a valid student id
The student ticket also includes Lower Austria and Burgenland making it possible to go to a school in Lower Austria or Burgenland
Cash, credit cards, or app (which also accepts PayPal, **finally**)
I personally prefer using the app if I need to go outside Vienna by train, while I use my yearly ticket to travel within the city
Never change a running system is the unofficial slogan of Austria
Can't you still get paper tickets in Tallinn when you buy directly from the driver
I think you  still could when I was there some years ago
Personally I'm not mad that there are still methods that don't depend on smart phones (I still know many Seniors who don't own one) or involve ones every move (potentially) being tracked with every swipe of a card
Though that's probably just my paranoid, reward-card-hating heart talking
But it's not like the paper tickets are the only way
It's just an additional option
The machines are already there, probably more expensive to get rid of them than keep them ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Huh, I guess they haven't updated the English text [on this official website] in quite some time then
>Paper ticket wich you get from the driver you do not need to validate
The annual ticket is a personalised plastic card like a credit card and shows up in the app
And every other ticket is directly availablie through the WL app
So yeah we have those paper tickets but those are for tourists who don't want to install the app and old people
Jugendtickets are different
They are either e-tickets on the smartphone ,print at home or paper tickets
Considering what I saw from a colleague of mine I understand why, children loose them way to often, so they are easy to replace
Last time i did this i was still in elementary school and itwas for a school photo, teacher told us to say "cheese" but we chose to say "Ameisenscheiße" ("ant shit") most of the time
Sam here, also the classic "Cheeeeese"
„Oh so you‘re from Austria
I always wanted to go there and see some Kangaroos
Or even worse: „Austria eh
So basically you are German
You don‘t know how fast (the always friendly) Austrians can get mad at you with these questions
"Sou you're basically german right
" Noooo please no
"Nice, I actually know someone from [insert random German city]"
.. I feel you
people thinking that Austria with its 1000 year long history, that clearely seperated itself from Germany after the Austro-Prussian war both in culture and language would just be a part of modern days Germany
I have a Slovakian friend who is a sound engineer
And I have a Czech one two, Czech one two
We have the first female chancellor in our history
Gay people can get married now (old news), even if one of the partners has the nationality of a  country where gay marriage is illegal (new news)
I think usually you say "child pornography". Some people online call it "kiddie porn", but I think that's a disgusting and trivializing term
Karl-Marx-Hof in Vienna is the longest (1
1km) residential building in the world
I stick with my solution
50 walloons, 50 from flanders, 1 from that german area
Drop them somewhere in siberia, give them guns, last survivor decides the government
Beating out Iraq, no less
Nope, never heard of that guy, I barely ever use Youtube
I can't even remember how I learned about it, I'm just very interested in Red Vienna
So far i have only heard of french, swedes, polish, austrians, turks and germans freezing to death in russia
So we can't really say if belgiums or germans are better at dealing with the russian winter
If that question would be in german i at least could make the joke, i don't eat "kartoffeln" (german word for potatoes) i only eat "erdäpfel" (austrian word for potatoes) so nothing changes, but no you ruined that opportunity
I'd weep for my tuberous friends; then increase my parsnip, sweet potato, and cassava intake
And *what* the fuck is going on in your kebap shops
"doners woefully incomplete"? Who puts *potatoes* into a Döner, and in what form
Who puts potatoes in a Döner
Outside of fries I don't really eat potatoes
And we can improvise for those
My Balkan colleagues agree with you
Yes and austria (and some south german areas, mostly south baveria) isn't the only nation that does that
The nederlands calls them "aardaaple" which also means earthapple
The french call then "pomme de terre" which means apple from the earth
Austrians definitely have Kapsalon
The most bland of all the breads
And if not bland sweeter than goddamn brioche
yes
You dont have to go the US for that
Ireland is really bad as well :/
No diversity in flour types if you want to make bread yourself for example
And where I was (Meynooth) they had only White bread
Austrians can definitely go crazy about skiing
[Here's] the atmosphere at the  night race in Schladming every year
Ski jumping can also draw large and passionate crowds as can Formula 1 at our annual race in Spielberg
As for violence, no, there is no hooligan culture around other sports (AFAIK) like in football/soccer
Just a lot of partying and drinking
>As for violence, no, there is no hooligan culture around other sports (AFAIK) like in football/soccer
Not as bad as football, but Icehockey has some pretty hardcore fans
No, we're going crazy about Alpine Skiing, which in its modern form was invented in Austria
It all fell apart since Marcel Hirscher retired, but hey, we were the best nation at the World Ski Championships 2021
Norway is always winning nordic skiing
We are talking about alpine skiing, which we are the best at
Yes that one
Not the "cross-country skiing". The "skiing-skiing".
Hardly
The most successful alpine skier in history was indeed a Swedish man, not Norwegian: Ingemar Stenmark
He won 86 world cup races during his career
He's followed by the Austrians Marcel Hirscher (67 wins) and Hermann Maier (54 wins)
The most successful woman was the American Lindsey Vonn with 82 wins
As for the most successful Nations overall, Norway has the 14th most wins in history of women's races (9 wins), and 4th most wins in men's races (143 wins)
Austria of course being the very clear #1 in both cases (370 wins for the women, 490 for the men)
Yes that's the word
I know you are talking about cross country skiing, we are talking about downhill skiing
In German there are totally different words for these two
I think he is talking about cross country skiing (Langlaufen)
The Norwegians are definitely better in that one
In German the downhill skiing is called "Schifahren" and the cross country skiing is called "Langlaufen". I didn't even know until today that there is no extra word for "Langlaufen" in English
We would try to argue with germany while getting ignored by them
While smoking at the table
So the same we would do with south tyrol and italy
Is the US even old enough to drink beer yet
O.o
In Austria we do that too
With the difference that we are way older and raised you, so you are more that teenager that doesn't listen to his parents anymore
The time our army lost a fight against itself because it fought over some alcohol
Thats basicly the most austrian thing ever and i am surprised it only happened once
Noone is 100% it really happened this way
But something happened thats for sure
The Germans had one like this called "Die Deutschen".
It was entertaining enough but not very objective and definitely a headscratcher
Historians almost universally loathed it
The story is apocryphical and never once mentioned in official documents
It only crops up in some newspapers well after the fact
Most likely its just an embelished story that soon became a modern myth
Theres an incident on the frontline which may have been the inspiration for this in a report to the Austrian court occuring on the 23
September 1788
It claims that the Austrians sent their supplies to the city of Karansebes while the cavalry should keep the Ottomans at bay
When the people on the supply train heard the shots by both the Austrian and Ottoman forces some of the leaders of the supply carts panicked and fled without the supplies
Some of these supplies were then captured by the advancing Turks while the rest of the supply train was reorganized and went on
Total casualties among the cavalry were 150 men
The Spanish Republicans are close to my heart
Always especially sad when I see the placques for the Spanish Republicans murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp near where I live
Oh absolutely
History classes as a whole should move away from "national" and great man history with battles, high politics and the like and focus also on technological and societal history
Things like the introduction of a new crop rotation system or the invention of new milling technology or the developments of city and town structures were way more important in the development of a region than the guy that extracted the taxes from them
>Ionian Islands
Don't forget them being Sicilian before that
Takeshi's Castle, do I even need to say more
Good thing you added the same quality prerequisite
I'm a bit gutted we didn't get our own version of 'The Office'. Then again, it might be too similar to the German one
once again, we are too close to Germany for our own good
any big-budget special effects disaster/blockbuster movie like armageddon, independence day or a marvel movie
let other cities be the center of the alien action for once (also I think it would be a lot of fun to see places you recognize in all these explosion scenes for a change)
I really enjoyed the first Bourne movie for that reason (the European setting)
alternatively, give me GTA5, but situated in Vienna
I second this motion
THIS
it would also teach people a bit about the inner workings of the EU, something every citizen should know about
just make it have good actors, and let there be some good guys (mostly in Parliament) as well
the Commission can mostly be the bad guys for all I care, haha
not necessarily rural (which Shoplifters also isn't?), but imho there's various good "chav life" movies, [Fish Tank] being among the best ones, it's a gut-wrenching mix between Kids, Cuties, and The Florida Project
and if you liked Shoplifters and would like more of the same Japanese setting, you'd probably also enjoy Tokyo Godfathers by the great [Satoshi Kon] good Christmas movie
but why yes there is
or have you never had to fill out an application with our dear people at the MA2412
I always dreamed of a assassin's creed in Vienna around 1900
I never saw it that way but i guess you're right
although having rewatched some of it recently i have to say it didn't age all that well
I've encountered quite a few people who unironically said that Austria is fully responsible for WW2
We are obviously only 98% responsible
That we don't have kangaroos
* [Just recently they caught an albino one]
* [Here's another one even out in the snow]
* [This one was close to Bad Ischl]
You do
Paul Joseph Watson
I heard in the US there's a lot of dry counties
Especially in Kentucky and Tennessee
It's that also because of Shakira law
> I've seen countless comments on /r/TIL that British accents used to sound American but we changed them as to not sound American
Wouldn't the other way round make much sense
Early American English sounding a lot more like British English and then it started to change because of the large distance between them and stuff
Similarly to how [Texas German] sounds nothing like any German dialect around in Europe today
That’s the same in every large city
I live in bangkok for around 1/2 year and the amount of people who complain about their newly chosen / forced upon them home is staggering
>Another one is that we have somehow overly low alcohol-taxes when infact they are one of the highest ones in Europe
First time i hear that one
Everyone know you're nordic and nordic alc is expensive
Where are you from again
Whats a finland
Lol
What are the maltese authorities gonna do
Attack me with their one battleship
Joke is on them, i live in a landlocked country
Not for much longer
Aaww really
You guys listened to our radio
I feel so appreciated right now
Shh
Rather Kurz getting into the EU commission in 10-15 years and deploying heavy military forces to the Turkish border because of climate refugees
Literally taliban
How much is 0
5l of finnish beer
No u
Interesting
So you're saying a fleet of old timey galleons with enough cannons could take Malta
now kiss
1,95€ *without* taxes
in a supermarket
Ah okay
I've never been to Malta
You should be fine then i guess
That's really expensive
Here I can buy 0,5l of low quality beer for 0,6 - 0,8€ in a supermarket, given there's no special offer
Mineral water is about the same or more expensive
Quality beer is around 1€-1,10€ (everything including taxes)
That explains a lot about nordic people's behaviour when they are here
I'd say Jack Unterweger
Guy murders a woman, goes to prison, becomes an very successful author in there, convinces people he changed, has a celebrity fan club that helps him to get out on parole, starts a serial murder spree on two continents WHILE reporting on those exact murders for the radio, getting caught again and finally hangs himself in prison
I'd guess the ["Ibiza affair"] when a video of our then vice chancellor was leaked where he was drunk, in a tank top, on a Finca in Ibiza, trying to sell Austrian water and our largest newspaper to a faux niece of a russian oligarch
Is that blur Xavier Naidoo
>having sex with a prostitute and beeing caught red handed in a police raid
Bless god I live in a country where prostitution is legal
The Nordic model is a failure and many experts and most sex workers agree
Sorry for the off topic rant, but I did quite some research on that topic, and I mostly found that most laws protecting prostitutes only improve the conscience of feminists and conservatives, but the voices of sex workers mostly get ignored
Here a very good video on the topic by philosophy tube, featuring the speaker of the American sex worker association: [
\-rant over
I'm still wondering why this is called "incest" in the french media instead of "rape" or "child abuse"... like, was this a consentual relationship
How old was the stepson
Complete sociopath but a highly talented one
People wanted him as an example that people can change in prison and become successful and worthy members of the society again
He knew that and he played them
There is one, but only a small Austrian one:
Swedish model aka Nordic model which makes buying sex illegal but only for the one who buys it, look it up
It is celebrated by feminists and loathed by sex workers with many studies showing that it's effectiveness is questionable, and violent assault against sex workers raising by a factor of then in France ...
Yo, flag-thief, we don't know who you are referring to
:D ;)
But that one's boring
We have so many other sociopaths that never get the recognition they deserve lol
I don't post a scientific link history on reddit, I have other work to do as well ... but before judging 1) Watch the video it's well researched 2) Google up sources about the problem beginning with remarks of sex worker societies world wide, but let me help for a start:  The main reason I got aware of this problem was the blog of the Austrian Sex Worker Society:
3) Yes I am male, so what
Stop your prejeduces and do some research
My main concern is that everyone talks about sexwork, but virtually no one cares about the voice of the sex workers themselves, they have no lobby and are between conservatives and progressives alike who still think that all sex workers are basically slaves although the truth lies in the middle
Yes ... this is the reason why I explained it to him
To be fair, the basement-owners weren't celebs before
If it weren't for that part of OP's question then yeah, there'd be a lot more Austrian examples
For me it was „Sweat (A La La La La Long)” by Inner Circle
I used to sing it all the time as a kid, even in front of my parents
I think I was like 16 when I first paid attention to the lyrics
The song "Bobby Brown" by Frank  Zappa is still played rather often in the radio
Which wouldn't be the case if people knew what it was about
He once was invited to the German TV-Show "Wetten dass", where he had translated the lyrics into German beforehand so everybody knew what he was singing about
Transmission was cut after a few seconds
I realized how *Brenda's Got a Baby* by 2Pac was about a girl who got raped by her cousin, got pregnant, had the baby in a public bathroom and dropped it into a garbage container because she was so overwhelmed, only to retrieve it later and then start dealing with drugs to make a little money
My all time favourite: The Divinyls
I don't want anybody else, when I think about you I touch myself oooh
You fucking what when ???
Because of similar experiences nearly every time I actively look up the lyrics of a song I like, I normally make it a point of *not* listening to lyrics in songs anymore
More often than not, they ruin a perfectly fine song for me
The opposite experience of being touched by "profound" lyrics has happened to me maybe once or twice in my life, at most, and it's just not something I go and look for
If I want emotionally touching words, I go read poetry (and I normally don't, because I find the whole concept kinda cringy)
If I want intellectually stimulating statements, I'll go read non-fiction
If I want the joy of using language creatively and word play, I go and read authors that are good at that, or do it myself
Listening to music, I mostly want to enjoy nice beats and interesting rhythms
Vocals normally are a distraction to that, and I try my hardest to listen to them as just another instrument (which is made easier tremendously by the fact that most songs are in English, and as a non-native, I can choose to kind of blend out the meaning of words most of the time)
It's gotten to the point where I really have to strain to hear words and not just sounds, and have to look up lyrics if I really want to know what a song is about (and normally, promptly regret I did so)
An exception to all that are songs with creative lyrics in my mother language, which I appreciate especially when they're using local dialect
But there's hardly any songs like that, and I listen to them very rarely
Mostly it's music without vocals, or vocals in languages I don't understand, or tuning out the lyrics I *could* understand
Works fine for me
it was more popular in the past, I can remember the "Kinderfreunde" always had adds for their camps in the alps
Hello everyone :)
Definitely one of my favourite subreddits :D
PogChamp
Twice a year
Always make the next appointment when I am there, because otherwise I know I wouldn't go
Also made the experience, that there is waaaay less work to be done when you go regularily
Only going there when in pain simply means you went there too late
May and November each year, for as long as I can remember
That's the most british comment in here
By the amount of people who think ww1 was startet by germans i think there is a small detail about austria many nations don't teach
Austria was a christian fascist country before Hitler invaded
Hitler was Austrian not German
Hey we learn about your history
from the moment we annexed you till the moment we lost you
r/me_ira
I mean Slovenia was part of the HRE after all
>Before that Austria was just one of many German states and pretty much all Austrians considered themselves Germans
Austria was several german states which together where the Habsburg Corelands, you know
Haus Österreich
>Austrian as a national identity distinct from German was only born post WW2 when everyone wanted to distance themselves from Germany and it's Nazi reputation
The Idea of a "Austrian Identity" was formed about the same time as the Idea of a german one
There were a lot of ideas discussed during the Dawn of Nationalism
It was focused after the Austrian Prussian War
I know it's a shame
Why was it deleted
The first time 1787, with some exceptions and modifications over the next hundred years
All pushed by a scientific comittee and the emperors personal will
In WW1 it was allowed again
In 1920 when the first republic was established, they abolished it again, the country was trying to be modern and liberal in general
In 1933 the Austrofascists allowed it again, and the Nazis kept it of course
In 1950 it was abolished again with some exceptions (that were never used) and since 1968 it was completely abolished
The last execution was 1950
There was one small extreme far right party (National Democrat Party
nothing suspicious about that name eh) that called for getting it back but they were irrelevant
Otherwise it's not a topic at all
Don't forget Frank stronach, who suggested reestablish it in 2013, when he campaigned for national elections
(he just gained enough votes to win some seats in Parliament, partly due to this)
The Last one was 1955 but under the juristication of the Allied forces
Kinda depends on where you're from
Switzerland/Norway/Iceland/Australia/New Zealand
Cool
USA
50/50 I'd say
China/Korea
There's definitely some reservations
If you're coming from Turkey most people won't look at you as an Expat but most likely think you're an immigrant worker
I mean it brought us Coffee
I think most people are grateful about that ;)
Not necessarily
There's a lot folks with Balkan roots that are indistinguishable from locals
My former boss has a name I can't even say out loud
My bank representative is from the Balkans
In both cases people are kinda surprised when they realise they aren't born here
I think the Balkan community in Austria is much bigger, has a lot more history dating back to the monarchy and is much more diverse in the public reception
But I must say: these are my personal experiences living in Vienna and moving in the circles I do
This might not be 100% accurate
And of course if you run around looking like a low level drug dealer people will treat you as one
Because pnany people are idiots
There's for one stereotypes
you know like arrogant unfriendly Frenchmen of which I have never met any outside of Paris
But these stereotypes exist and some people believe them
Obviously not every American weighs 270lbs, owns 6-8 guns and while they can name their president in 1834 don't know that Africa isn't a country that's bordering Russia or fail to do simple maths
But some people do believe firmly in stereotypes
The USA just doesn't have that kind of laid-back, chilled image of Australia or NZ
And then - and I say that in the most neutral way I can - the USA have been burning their reputation for decades now
During the cold war it was kinda cool to have someone to have your back and afterwards starting with Clinton there was a lot of diplomatic capital that got burned
During the Kosovo War in '99 the US interfered without UN mandate so Austria, as a neutral country, didn't allow the US Air Force to enter our airspace for bombing runs from German NATO airfields to Kosovo
But the US Air Force didn't care and violated the airspace nonetheless
Then there was this whole Bush Jr
thing which from an Austrian perspective was mostly the supreme court deciding that their friend's son should become president although he lost the election
And after 9/11 the "war on terror" quickly became a vehicle for US imperialism, further destabilising an already volatile region
This led to some pretty strong anti-american sentiments for some people
Then there was Obama who continued the bombings and the war in the Middle East
And the one thing people around here could get behind that he did -- working out some sort of general healthcare for at least for those who couldn't afford it -- was publicly torpedoed by even some Democrats
The Snowden leaks and the NSA scandal didn't portray the USA in a favourable light either
Thus the political image of the USA being the school bully who takes what he pleases and thinks he's popular
And then the era of Donald Trump followed and I guess I don't have to tell you that this generally didn't reflect well on the USA as a whole around here either
Now combine that with the already existing stereotypes that leads to some people not only thinking that every American is a fat dumb gun-nut but actually now seeing Americans as representative of the USA's foreign policy
This leads to the sentiment by some people that all Americans should just leave Europe - no matter if you're in a military posting, a diplomat or just some random guy that some company hired and sent to Austria
Now I don't say that's all people
And most people I would say have no issues whatsoever
But the US kinda lost their favourable image and sometimes you have to break the stereotype and specify that you do know how to use your inside-voice indoors, that you don't think it's a good idea to arm teachers, that you can actually find your current location on a globe and that Arnold Schwarzenegger was in fact the greatest action movie actor of the 80s ;)
But as in most cases it depends on whom you're talking to
I'm Austrian so you can imagine the amount of Nazi and Hitler comments I sometimes get online
And most of them are very poor effort even
Also what I would say especially for Austria - can't really say that for other places - is that casual racism is kind of prominent
It's something many especially slightly older people don't even do consciously or with any kind of malicious intend but they sometimes are curious nor just don't know how to deal with being out of their comfort zone and experiencing someone 'different' and I know from some international friends that they at least at first feel/felt rather uncomfortable because of that
Especially since many Austrians are rather private people and are really bad at small talk which doesn't make it easy, especially for expats here
The arrogance and ignorance of about 50% of the country
(not op)
You can use every East-Asian nationality instead of Korea
I'm not sure a lot of people would be able to tell whether someone comes from Korea or China unless they explicitly tell you
And you know
many people are kind of afraid or on edge of everything that is highly different to what they're used to and what they're unfamiliar with
Korea and China certainly are places with a highly different culture
Well you're welcome to become my neighbor ;)
>many other countries
There's only 9 countries with a large number of orthodox Christians
>I sure hope my rent transfer will be processed in time
I'm still fascinated that in 2021 banks still aren't able to process payments 7 days a week
I'm OK with no 24/7 but come on
There's definitely a reason why paypal and Venmo are that popular
Winter 0
5-1 time per day
Summer 1-2 times per day
usually 1x a day (before going to bed)
If I do sports in the morning and I cannot combine the after-sport-shower with my evening-shower then it's 2x.
In summer I might also shower 2 or 3 times to cool off or to get fresh when I have a meeting or something
After doeing something sweaty or once per day
I can see where it comes from, I guess I would sweat in Brazil climate the whole day,
I'm a bit suprised many here don't take baths, I try to get one once a week, usually it's just I don't have enough time for it or I'm to fucking tired
Wheel, or just a knife
I don't get the idea of scissors because that means you have to lift the pizza up to do so which potentially results in a mess
This is
Oh my, how can you, this is
...actually pretty clever
Where are the Italians
As far as I know, in some parts of Italy (especially Napoli), pizza is cut with scissors
Many people in Austria use [these] Some of course just use a knife
I’ve actually never seen or heard of someone cutting pizza with scissors
But I will do that the next time I don’t have a pizza cutter
I have a friend of mine and she‘s one of the food sinners, as we call them lovingly in our Server
Also she‘s german so ig she doesn‘t really count for Austria
Around here I never heard of scissors
You never had a good pizza wheel then
Its not that bad
You use a long pair of scissors and gently slide under the pizza while holding the scissor almost vertically
Much quicker and easy to use than a pizza wheel
Three words:
Dedicated kitchen scissors
I use the old fingers and knife method
It guarantees uneven pieces and messy hands and sometimes even a cut pizza
> Much quicker and easy to use than a pizza wheel
I'm really wondering if people ITT have never used a sharp pizza wheel/knife, because cutting a pizza with a sharp wheel takes like 2 seconds
Don't tell me that's faster with scissors
But even if you don't use the wheel, just cutting it with a sharp knife is super quick, you don't need to lift anything up, and you are having an easier time cleaning
I'm really trying to understand what advantage a scissor has but I just cannot see how scissors are better than a sharp knife
I'll try it tomorrow but I'm pretty sure the knife is easier
> squashing force of a knife
Do people not have sharp knifes
Did you never encounter an actual sharp knife
A sharp knife cuts even through soft things and doesn't squash anything
You don't "push the surface down before the cut", the cut starts as soon as you touch the toppings
Are you really claiming that scissors do less squashing on for example a cooked grape tomatoe than a sharp knife
Basically pay up a doctor (that was of very dubious quality) or die
Austria jokes mostly about Vienna about nearly everything possible
There is a common saying, "Wien ist anders", which is used most of the time to swipe away how absurd Vienna actually is
Just Like in Austria
Only they Look especially down on "Burgenland"
Also there are some jokes that Vorarlberg is the Austrian version of New Zealand just because it gets forgotten sometimes
Or the popular jokes about Fucking
sorry
Fugging
Don't forget the general pity that is given to Burgenland always
I get why:
- It's flat as fuck (highest elevation 800m)
- it doesn't have *any* cities, and its capital town is in Hungary
- they either talk weird German or weird Croatian
- half the people who are from there leave because it's so boring
- you have to constantly drink wine in order to stand the boredom of living there
- the public transport is shit, there's like one train going there per day
- the only slightly cool thing they have is a huge and extremely shallow lake that is really more like a puddle of dirt + lots of storks
- Gottfried Küssel lives there
The ones joking about Vienna are just jealous because they don't live in the world's most livable city
My experience:
Counties people joke about: Vienna, Burgenland, Carinthia
Counties people don't joke about: Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Styria
Counties nobody cares about: nö, oö
I think it was renamed to Fucking because the local sign was vandalized to say Fucking all the time lmao (don‘t quote me on that one tho)
Austria's least livable village is still better than the world's most livable city
>Counties people don't joke about: Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Styria
Gsiberger Witze are very common in all of Austria
As they are the only ones with an Alemannian dialect
Styria jokes are are very common in states that border Styria
The opposite
It was renamed to Fugging because people stole the Fucking- road signs all the time
If you're a yodelling hillbilly
Wous houst du groud gsogt
I thought I saw a post of Fucking being named to Fugging and later being renamed to Fucking because people vandalized the sign to say Fucking again on the r/Austria subreddit, but I think I was wrong
Sorry for that one
I am
Fair enough
Honestly I love Vienna, it's a beautiful city with a lot of grumpy people
I just could not live there, I'm not made for any city
I need mountains and rivers and less people
Right
Would make sense especially for the alive and well French movie industry
Maybe it doesn't get its own name when it's just situated in the capital (as I assume is the case in France)
That's how I think it is here, everything movie-related happens in the dominant capital, but nobody goes around making up the name Viennawood for that
Oh I see
Cannewood it is then, or Forêt Canne or something similar
Vienna (1
9 Million): Completely oversized for a small country like Austria (~8
85 Million)
It's the only big city we have and is politically really important
Graz: (290
000): A nice looking city
I don't know a lot about it
As it is cut off from the western and northern parts of Austria by the mountains so you normally don't visit it too often
Graz is a lovely looking city with an intact and cozy old-town
Living there is extremely cheap
Graz is a student city
Linz (207
000): Industrial city, many joke about that it's a steel-factory with houses built around it
Of course that's not entirely true
But the whole region and metropolitan area (<700
000) is an industrial and production hub in Austria
Most of Austrias exports come from here
The thing with Vienna is, that it was not intended to be capital for tiny Austria but it was built to be the centre of hapsburg empire
The land around it crumbled and therefore it fell out of proportion
I would say Vienna tries to hold up old standards with high culture such as museums, opera and theatre, but mainly for tourists
They try to position itself as a wine region; there is a surprising big area used for winemaking but compared to other regions in Austria it is not that big (in the other wine regions there is hardly any other stream of income big enough to mention)
By the rest of Austria Vienna is seen as unfriendly and arrogant
Viennese leave the impression of not being in touch with the rest of Austria and people complain about decisions being made "by Vienna", referring to the head of politics
Although the Bundesländer and counties are much more powerful it sometimes reminds me of French people complaining about Paris, since all decisions are made there
There is a common attribute used for viennese: "großkopfert" or "big headed". Since more than a hundred years some critics referred to Vienna as the "wasserkopf von Österreich" literally meaning "hydrocephalus" since it was already big for the capital of hapsburg empire
Completely off topic, but i got hungry by just reading about debreziner sausage and szegediner goulash
Bless you my hungarian Friends
We truly have inherited many great dishes from hungary
I've been to Bolzano a few times because of the cultural ties it has with Austria, but other than that I wouldn't really know why anyone would rather visit Bolzano over for example Milano
It's not that nice of a city I think
I think we don’t have mandatory vaccinations - but to have access to a lot of social services you need to have an up to date “mutter kind pass” (mother - child pass)
So everybody does the tests and vaccinations in the pass
Ifs basixally a stick and carrot approach and works amazingly well
Yes, we used to do that with most foreign monarchs
Louis XIV was Ludwig XIV (still is) and Henry VIII was Heinrich VIII
It was also done with popes, except with the current one everybody agreed that "Papst Franz" sounds silly, so the media went with Fraziskus instead (which is half Latin half German)
For ancient history we tend to use Greek/Latin names for rulers that are now more commonly called by their names in their own languages
Thus German scholars often call the pharaoh Akhenaten Echnaton instead
Slovakia
Vienna isn't as horrible as people from other parts of Austria think
And vice versa
It's a pretty popular thing to think here since seemingly so many of them immigrate to Western Europe
Yeah, but you're from *Russia*.
It probably has a better reputation in Austria than most of Western Europe
Moreso in general it seems to be usually stereotyped as your average small shitty post-communist country
Don't get me wrong, I don't think Slovakia is super exciting or anything, but I just barely notice any difference when crossing the border apart from the occasional commie blocks like in Petržalka
It's a nice and cozy country with chill people
I mean it's basically our fault because they are catered to us, but the border region is filled with cheap brothel's and street prostitutes
Ask Austrians about it
"Yes, it's the best city for the rich expats they interviewed
" & "They just didn't set foot into district XYZ" is what you are going to hear
That Russia is (and I know that's not true - the entire comment was a joke) a hellish hellhole
Compared to it, everything would seem nice
From the Gopniks eating Semechki to crazy Lada drivers ...
I am *very* serious about making generalizations based on stereotypes
;) I actually read that comment before posting that one, didn't realize you were the guy
Most people realize it's not that simple and that most people are not dicks
I think I only worked in "unconventional" companies so far - each had their own traditions that nobody else ever heard of
At one, drinking beer at work was totally normal
Whenever someone had a birthday, or a important project was finished, or whatever, the whole department got together for a few beers
Just in the middle of the day and back to work
On normal days too, if you felt like it, just grab a beer and keep working
I suspect my department lead came up with that, afterall he lead the IT department in a big brewery before
Some startups do this with their "beer fridges" for late night crunches but that was different
And quite a while ago
Oh we never got actually drunk at work (tipsy on Friday afternoon maybe
), it was almost always 1-3 beers max
It was about the beer and the coworkers, not alcohol
My department lead was pretty impressive, you could give him a beer in an unmarked glass and he could tell you pretty precisely what part of the country it's from
Always brought fun new beers to try too
I guess you don't become a certified beer sommelier, and work for a brewery, without a reason
Would say Vodka Juniors but their songs are in English
But worth checking out
Heathen Foray - Mei Laund
That's pretty much what you asked for, sans the local instruments
Judging by your rules, absolutely not what you're looking for but [a national treasure]
I've never heard anyone else mention Van Canto before
To those who don't know: they are an acapella (drums are usually the only instrument) with a bunch of original songs as well as great covers of classics
Shit rocks yo
Since Adolf would be to obvious, I'd nominate *another* fascist dictator of Austria, [Engelbert Dollfuß]
You can say he was a bad and dictatorial ruler, but insane
How do you justify that label
He wasn't insane in any clinical sense
He defiantly wasn't insane in any clinical sense
true, but I would still a prefere a nickname like Fairhair
Dude was only 1,51m tall lmao
I'd say every fascist is insane
Then the label is meaningless
Do we know what are facts and what ottoman propaganda
Pretty sure he didnt make a deal with the devil or smth
as long the infected people are outside and doors well shut
Well the Grasser Corruption case was in the media a lot
It took forever
That was banned in Switzerland
Just seems to discriminate poor people, without any real gain
I imagine there were fines for those who begged, which they couldn't have paid anyway
Also the Case of the Franz Fuchs
It's more famous because of his rants and paroles he shouted out during the process
>Just seems to discriminate poor people, without any real gain
A ton of "beggars" are actually begging for a crime organization and only get to keep a tiny amount of money
>social welfare that helps the poor
Of course, but tell me one place where that works perfectly
Begging should always be the last option, but to outlaw it just forces them into criminality
From where do they cross your border
That stuff would be as profitable in Germany/Austria etc
Why make the effort to get to Switzerland
The train ticket back home thing is just a scam
It's something, some beggars do here as well
I know a guy who needs a train ticket back home for about 10 years+ now
There are definitely easier places to smuggle people in to, I don't think Switzerland is the prime destination for that
Netherlands = bikes
Luxemburg = money
Belgium = waffles and chocolate
And I have a picture of the way cities look in Netherlands in my head
Not as a standalone, no
Ooooh I just grew more fond of Greek because it's a language where you can leave out the subject
I love that feature of Spanish and hate that German conjugates **and** needs subjects
To my knowledge, wel just means good
So you will most likely be able to use both just like you are able to say "good bye" or just "bye" in english
Edit: it also makes sense
In german you can also say "dank dir schön" (word by word translation: thank you well) and "dank euch schön" (thank you (plural) well)
But is mostly used in dialekts
[Not surprising in a world, where Pepsi once had the 6th largest navy that included 17 submarines, a cruiser, a frigate, and a destroyer
And then they sold the whole fleet to a Swedish company
Maybe they had a few too many interwar fighters
The "Königlich bayerische Greifenreiterkorp", of course
As an Austrian, I can't relate
We've read Faust (Goethe), Die Verwandlung (Kafka), Jugend ohne Gott (Horvath), Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum (Böll), Der Besuch der alten Dame (Dürrenmatt), Woyzeck (Büchner), Draußen vor der Tür (Borchert), Kein Platz für Idioten (Mitterer) and Die Leiden des jungen Werther (Goethe) among others
Additionally to general German works like Goethe, Schiller, Kafka, Mann ... we read Austrian literature like Grillparzer, the comedic plays of Nestroy and post war works of Thomas Bernhard, Jelinek etc
But there is also room for your own reading lists
I comprised myself one including 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World and wrote my final essay on SciFi dystopias
We also read an originally greek work "Antigone" in german class
Also a lot of plays - some from Nestroy, Schnitzler, Ödon von Horvath etc
I had to read most of them too
We also read "Die Schachnovelle" (Hesse) and "Die Physiker" (Dürrenmatt)
I really enjoyed reading most of them
Was ich mich noch erinnern kann (wahrscheinlich manche falsch geschrieben)
Die Nibelungen (Novelle)
Das Parfüm
Das Bildnis von Dorian Grey
Jackyll and Hide
Die Schachnovelle
Die Wolke
Ein paar österreichische Bücher, die längst nicht mehr in Erinnerung sind
Bahnhof Zoo (hab ich gehasst)
Tschick
Die Welle
Und ein paar zweite Weltkriegsliteratur
For me it was George Orwell and Shakespeare (Animal Farm,  Romeo and Julie, Macbeth)
Edit: British in Austria now; educated in England
I've read that too
I was so confused at first, because "Tschick" is an Austrian word for cigarette
In the book it's just a name for a character
We read and analysed each entire book
We read Macbeth in class - with individual parts read (played
) by individual students - and analysed it together as we went
Same but less intense for R&J. Animal Farm is more novel so we read a chapter between each lesson and then discussed
This was 1993-1995

Good question
Also I think it's hard to know what you'd actually miss without having had the experience of being abroad and really, really *missing* some things you know from home
Of course this is often really basic stuff or things that you can't really physically *take with you* per se, but I'll just call this list "what I can't live without" so that it fits the first part of the question:
-**easy access to wooded areas (forest etc)
** that means having to drive no less than 30 minutes to go somewhere where there's no people, just nature
would like to bring it if I could, or travel to places where it exists anyway
-**good drinkable tap water
** ooh boy, I miss it every time I go abroad
I even brought it with me on occasions, but sadly never more than the one bottle I fill at the airport after the security check
-**proper bread
** and by that I mean dark sourdough rye bread, none of that fluffy stuff or toast bread (we don't even call that bread; just *toast*. it's not bread if your teeth don't get a workout eating it
-**clean air
** missed it sorely in big cities in south east asia
hard to bring with, sadly
-**big bowl of salad or uncooked greens
** it's really rare in some countries to eat uncooked crunchy veggies
I start to crave it so hard after a few weeks, sadly never managed to bring it with me
-**sweet dishes as the main dish
** this is more a piece of culture than an actual meal, but one I'm really fond of
I've actually brought relevant ready-made meals or ingredients (like [Germknödel] [Mohnnudeln] [Kaiserschmarrn] with me to show them to friends
-**cozy relaxed dinners with friends
** at home, going out for dinner normally means that we'll stay at the restaurant after dinner, have a drink, talk and in general have a good time
and while I can accept that things work differently somewhere else, and people might just eat and then continue on to their next destination for the evening, I really really miss just staying where you are, relaxing and enjoying each other's company
I'd say I manage to do this by bringing **my friends** with me though
And thinking about the second part of the question, a list of more things I actually like to physically *bring* on my travels (and excluding basic things like electronics, standard clothes or toiletries because that's gonna be the same for everybody anyway), I can think of the following:
-**proper leather hiking boots
** yeah I know ultralight approach shoes are super popular right now
I also use them on hot summer hikes in the flatland
but there's just something about [proper handmade leather shoes] the ones that you put wax on once a year to make them near indestructible, and you own for ten years or longer with just needing to resole them from time to time
the leather conforms to your foot over time and makes them fit like a pair of gloves, and also makes for a much better foot climate than crappy plastic shoes as well
-**certain toiletries
** we like what we are used to I guess, and there's this specific brand of shower gel and tooth paste that I really like and could never find anywhere else, so I normally bring it
the tooth paste is actually light red and tastes salty
-**standard bag of medicine
** same with medicine; when you're sick and stuck in some seedy hostel where everything's weird and unknown, there's something really comforting about just taking what you know (like a bag of Neocitran) and feeling like you're properly taking care of yourself
-**proper electrical plug or adapter**. and by proper I mean type F, long live the Schuko
no but really, I honestly miss those when going abroad and having to deal with the other variants that are all either too flimsy or humongous
-**bike
** yeah I wish I could take this more often
-**barefoot shoes
** one more shoe category
I just really like walking in them
2 or 3 of my favourite Freitag bags, Kaweco travel pen, notebook, kindle, the watch my husband gave me, favourite lipstick, favourite earrings, cinnamon mints
>šajtrga (Scheibtruhe : samokolnica)
Do you know "kajola"? Thats what we say in southern Carinthia and it supposedly comes from Slovenian
They're not mutually exclusive
Well, there's another German speaking country between you
Italy is closer to Austria you know
Würstel / Wirschtl is normal here
When i was a kid i always wondered what a "Palat" is and what ham has to do with crepé. Now i know better ty
Schraubn or Schraufn in Carinthia
Germans use it aswell
Not common, but also not super rare
And nobody cares about them
Not so common
View of the society Imho changed, in the 90's and early 2000's it wasn't really viewed good by the majority
Nowadays most really don't care
I mean I’ve had long hair and most people don’t care
Some elders may look funny or think that you are a girl (maybe they have bad eye sight)
You know what's even more practical
Short hair
Get a haircut you hippie
No just kidding, kind of
But looking good and well groomed with long hair is definitely more work than with short hair, talking from my own experience
Gottesanbeterin - woman that is praying to god, (female) worshiper of god
Yes praying mantises are specifically female here, even the males get called Gottesanbeter*in,* which is weird now that I think of it
Same in German
"Gottesanbeterin"
Has to be "I am from Austria" from Rainhard Fendrich
Everyone knows it and sings along when it's played at any public gathering
I would say nowadays its Parov Stellar, at least in the electronic genre
Other than classical music,
[Rock Me Amadeus - Falco] and [Egoist - Falco] are two I think are pretty known globally
Nah
It would be Mozart, Falco, *Live is Life*.
Italy has a shitton of classical music everyone instantly recognizes (maybe not by the name but by the music), e.g.:
La Traviata - Libiamo ne' lieti calici
Il barbiere di Siviglia - Overture and Fígaro
Nabucco - Và Pensiero
The Four Seasons - Winter
Aida - Triumphal March
Dies Irae (Verdi)
Adagio in G after Albinoni
Ponchielli - Dance of the Hours
O Sole Mio by Eduardo di Capua
Boccherini's Minuet
the four notes from Beethoven's 5th or Wagner's Bridal Chorus are probably even more recognizable
or Life is Life by Opus
Oh, I misread the question, I thought it meant in my own country, my bad
Of course more people know Falco outside of Austria
Little Germany
Anything to do with Germany
Also, that the empire was small
Hahaha, I kind of expected this one to be top comment
"You're just like Germans right, just a bit slower and less tidy
I met one guy hitting on me and telling me he is from Slovakia and I asked him about it, you know small talk style, and I noticed he always used Slovenian as an adjective to Slovakia
I was super confused and at some point I told him straightaway to tell me where he is actually from - turned out he was from Chechnya and was ashamed about that
Because Austria lost against Prussia in 1866
Are you from bavaria or baden würtenberg
:D no, I married a way creepier guy
We didn't do nearly enough
Some were imprisoned and so on, but Denazification was a lot better in Germany
"Oh noes we were the first victims we didn't do anything".
Sadly really badly
See Waldheim affair as an example
Hey
We didn't do nothing
People who were a bigger deal in the Wehrmacht or SS weren't allowed to join the military
Hence our general defense plan against a Soviet invasion was developed by a civilian consultant (who formerly was a prominent member of the OKH I think)
...okay we did nothing
I don't think so but I don't know
Our defense plan is just a less effective version of the swiss plan tbh
> developed by a civilian consultant
[a pattern emerges] ;)
Nobody ever claimed Beethoven was Austrian though
Also birth place means nothing
doesn't make it less bullshit though
You can continue to add stuff, still does not change the truth
I'm not upset about anything, you are just babbling along unrelated things, that's all
All of them
That is an excellent question
No idea
Not *that* many I think
I'll try to recollect:
In Upper Austria I've been to the Schaumburg ruin, Clam, Altpernstein (I've slept there numerous times), Leonstein ruins, Schloss Klaus (I've slept there too; originally it was a castle), Schloss Linz (also used to be a castle, and used to be even a Roman *castrum*, and before that a Celtic one), various of the fortification towers around Linz, Bergschlössl Linz (I used to go there with my friends to drink beer), Schloss Freistadt, Kaiservilla Bad Ischl (if you wanna count that), Schloss Puchberg Wels, and a bunch of others I can't remember the name or the exact location of
Other Austrian states: Dürnstein ruin, the historicist Franzensburg in Laxenburg (if you wanna count that), Perchtoldsdorf, Landskron by the Lake Ossiach, Hohensalzburg, Hofburg in Vienna (yes it's a palace, but it's at the same time a castle and originally it very much fulfilled the purpose of a castle), Schlossberg in Graz
Other countries: Bratislava, Prague, Cesky Krumlov, Cracovia, Buda, London, Stuttgart (more of a palace really), Madrid de los Austrias (I guess
), Alhambra in Granada, Xativa, the gate towers of Valencia (they kinda castle-like), Alcazar in Cordoba, Alcazar in Sevilla, that old castel thing on the hill in Malaga, batteries on the Rock of Gibraltar, Castillo de Almodovar del Rio, Castillo de Javier in Navarra, Palacio Real de Olite in Navarra, Uxue in Navarra, Castillo de Carlos V. in Hondarribia, the castle on Urgull in Donostia, Castel Sant'Angelo, the Vatican, I think there used to be a bunch of palaces on the Palatin Hill (thus the name *palace*) and I've been there, some place close to Verona, Akkon, Knossos, some other place on Crete, some place on Kos, some place on Corfu, some place in Girona (?), some place in Barcelona (?), Limassol,  and probably a bunch of others
Lots
And then some more
The difference between palace and castle is often not very clear cut, since many old castles (in the sense of miliarty fortifications), later were trasnformed into palaces
Take the Hofburg in Vienna for example
It's a huge rennaissance, baroque and historicist palace complex, but at its core there is a medieval castle, that originally had very much the purpose of a military fortification
13th/14th month of salary (with additional tax benefit)
up to 2 years of maternity leave (fathers can consume part of it instead of mothers)
comprehensive medicare for all employees
Those are just some of the basic ones every employee gets regardless of what you do
Some industries have venefits of their own and espexially start-ups are developing good incentives like 30hour weeks on full salary
Austria is pretty cool like that
I get a phone for personal use from work (it's not declared as a work phone but as a goody and I can choose to pick up or not and can't be forced to carry it with me) and working for an ISP and phone company there's no limits regarding voice/data use in Austria and quite generous limits in Europe + I can use 2 complementary products (the portfolio includes Spotify Premium, mobile TV, newspaper epaper, movie theatre rebates, 200mins of telephony in a country of my choice and a couple more) for free
Of course other products of the company are available for way cheaper as employee
Lunch is subsidized, a 3 course meal of totally acceptable quality is around 3
Company pays for the metro ticket or offers you a parking spot
They finance 2 company football, a volleyball and some other employee sports team, as well as vouchers for a tennis court iirc, they offer on campus massages and shiatsu for like 10€/30mins
There's furthermore a couple of healthcare benefits I haven't looked into because frankly I haven't needed it yet, the option to have lunch with the CEO on your birthday (which is kinda fun truth to be told), an extra paid vacation day a year, child daycare, and some other minor stuff I don't recall
Oh, and you can use the mail department for receiving personal packages although they are telling you they won't accept the 85" TV you ordered off Amazon (but from experience of a colleague they're fine with ~50" TVs
) but considering the performance of DHL & FedEx in my area that's very convenient
Overall I think it's not too special but I can't complain
There is a joke in Austria about that, that nobody here will find funny, but anyway
What city has AEIOU in its name
Laeioum
Actually the city is called Leoben, but in the ridiculous local dialect, people say it like that
Do names count
The Dame *Aiuóla* of the fantasy story *Neverending Story*
(Yes the ó is in there even in the German version)
&#x200B;
Otherwise, maybe Mietauto (rental car)
> and sometimes y, which can act as both vowel and consonant
When is y a consonant in German, not counting English loan words
As far as I can tell it's always pronounced as i or ü, or something in between those two
At least in German place names that is always the case
Sylt, Pyhrn, Steyr, Weyer, Speyer, Schwyz ...
> estadounidense
Also, that one has 3 Es
Ideally you have each vowel only once
~~I didn‘t know Laeioum is a universal Austrian pronounciation but I‘ll gladly accept this reality~~
> What city has AEIOU in its name
Laeioum
That's hilarious
Gotta remember that one
>  Heizölrückstoßabdämpfung
Nice
No idea if that even actually exists, but a nice word nevertheless
Exactly
The pronoun, in this case ei/ele oleiau, is (like in Italian) optional and mainly used when you need to avoid a confusion in the sentence
True, didn't think about good ol' Yacht
Never seen anyone drunkenly sing at any point anywhere
I don't hang with crowds like that
*laughs in Austrian* what colonies
Absolutely - at least for the older generations
The heavy accents of *German West Hungary* are a pain to understand ;)
Wos moanstn hiatz domit
Eure Kolonie
Wappler oida
The balkan was where our "colonies" were
But our language didn't spread there
Some words did
I've seen a number of words from Serbian or Polish that look like German words phonetically spelled in Viennese dialect
It's either 1866 and Austria's end of German hegemony after losing the war to Russia, the civil war in 1934 or the time after WW2 with a distinctive non-German identity and the eternal neutrality associated with it in our 1955 state treaty
For Austria I'd say it's both world wars
But for my region in particular it would be the Tyrolean Rebellion against the bavarian and french troops in 1809
Obviously WW1 did more damage to my region as we were split in two parts but the rebellion is very much what defines and unites the people of north and south tyrol to this day
WW2 too
Austria has had a long history and many changes
But if we are talking about how modern Austria got it's identity it was the aftermath of WW2
You see Austria was in a bad spot after WW1
We lost most of our land,economy and all of our prestige and power
So it started a huge movement where Austria wanted to be apart of Germany and viewed themselves as Germans
(I am of the opinion that Austrians are as much Germans as Irish are British, Austria had been independent for many centuries at that point, never was apart of Prussia or the German Empire and, until recently, was a Great Power of its own)
But the Peace Treaties and general politics after WW2 forever entrenched the idea of Austrians being Austrians and not Germans
Then the eventual "Staatsvertrag" (National Treaty) of 1955 cemented Austrias "everlasting Neutrality" (that was how it was officially called btw) and future political endeavours
Staying out of the Warsaw Pact and Nato, givigng Austria the rare oppertunity to trade with both sides
Albeit Austria stayed western-oriented
&#x200B;
Nowadays we mostly hang back and don't really do much politically outside of hosting international organizations or treaties
Or local politics with our neighbors
Dont forget the battle for Vienna
> secular republic
Is this still the case, not in theory but actually
Eh, it was one of the bricks that build up to today
But Austrias identity doesn't really have anything to do with the Battle of Vienna
Yeah autocorrect
It was rather small
But the time between the burning of the palace of justice in 1927 and the transformation into a dictatorship 1934 was a wild ride
It lasted 2 days or something
My bad
Sauerkraut
I never liked it and can barely get that garbste down my throat
Beuschl (a stew made from innards) is absolutely vile
Already made my own comment, but omg same
Krautsalat is wonderful and tasty, but Sauerkraut tastes like unwashed moldy socks
The Krampus thing
Where do you get free buckets
What else are you going to look at tho
Can't just ignore everyone
Which Krampus thing
The one were drunk people try to pull each other over a table and beat each other other while wearing a Krampus costume, or the regular thing where drunk people only beat each other up in Krampus costumes
Meh, around here in Middle Europe people wouldn't give a fuck either
We have kids dressing up as a black guy (one of the three wise men) every year for after-Christmas celebrations (6th of January)
It's not offensive in the slightest, just a tradition
Kinda like in India
What are you, an Anarchist
Hellweg sometimes has free buckets too
Huh, I don't know
[The former] variation is only practiced in Osttirol afaik
The thing with the tables starts around min 2:22
When I did Erasmus and met on a weekday with my group of friends from all kinds of European countries, I realized how more alcohol I usually consumed than anybody else
Like, I drank 3 (small) beers  while others only 1
In Austria however, I often consume less than most of my friends
Made me really think about our drinking culture
That's the trick tho
You can look at people while pretending to look out of the window
You are right, its a thing in Germany as well
But Southern Germany
> But since Bavaria is more Austrian than German
Take that back
Du rüttelst am Watschenbaum, ~~Saupreiß~~ lieber nördlicher Stiefcousin
Our kangaroos for our people
Do you mean
*A backl watschen san glei aufgrissn
Can't even speak the dialect named after your state properly, unbelievable :p
Well Salzburger (and Upper Austrians to a lesser degree), who are Bavarian in all but name are included in /r/aeiou after all
Many, all for different topics
[There‘s actually a website] where you can see all of the museums in Austria
I apologize in advance that I‘m listing so many
I chose 4 for Vienna, and 2 in Salzburg along wit 2 in Styria
If there are any Austrians here, they should feel free to add more that are either in their home state or also well known
So here are the ones I think are pretty significant:
Vienna:
* [The Hofburg] (the former home of the Habsburg family, currently our president lives there and all of our political debates are in it, but it‘s also classified as a museum)
* [The Kunsthistorisches Museum] (Museum of Fine Arts or literally translated: Museum of Art History)
* [Schloss Belvedere, specifically Upper Belvedere] or more specifically: [The Österreichische Galerie Belvedere] And wikipedia can explain why I chose it better than I can: _The Belvedere's art collection presents an almost complete overview of the development of art in Austria and, thus, an insight into the country's history
The world's largest collection of Gustav Klimt's paintings lies at the heart of the presentation of Art around 1900, on show at the Upper Belvedere
* [Schloss Schönbrunn] - A really beautiful castle and former summer residence of the Habsburg family
With it comes a beautiful Tiergarten (zoo) in the gardens of the castle - which is by the way the oldest zoo in the world and has the first naturally bred panda baby born in captivity in Europe
Salzburg:
* [Keltenmuseum] - I was there actually and it was damn amazing
I was in Hallstatt too, where you can go into the salt mines
All of it was so interesting
* [Bergbau- und Gotikmuseum (Mining and Gothic museum)] - Ijust think stuff like Gothic and all of that is very interesting
Also, this collection is unique throughout europe
Styria:
* [Universalmuseum Joanneum] - Fun Fact by Wikipedia: _It is the oldest museum in Austria as well as the largest universal museum in central Europe with over 4
5 million objects in 13 departments and 12 locations in the Styrian cities of Graz, Stainz, Trautenfels, and Wagna (Flavia Solva)
* [Admont Abbey (Stift Admont)] - Fun Fact by Wikipedia: _Admont Abbey contains the largest monastic library in the world as well as a long-established scientific collection
It is known for its Baroque architecture, art, and manuscripts
My absolute favorite in Denmark was den gamle by
Aros in Aarhus is also cool
Wennst vor jedem Stern einen doppelten Absatz machen würdest, hättst eine wunderschöne Liste
Also, I'd add the Ars Electronica in Linz
Damn, universalmuseum joanneum is the biggest in Austria AND Central Europe
I've been there once and wasn't blown away
I guess I didn't see all departments or something
The Kunsthistorische & Naturhistorische in Vienna seem so much bigger
Edit: German wikipedia says that the Kunstistorische (museum of art history) is bigger
In Vienna: Naturhistorisches Museum, Technisches Museum, Schatzkammer, Foltermuseum, Narrenturm, Haus der Musik, ZOOM Kindermuseum, etc
Then I know that Swarovski Kristallwelten and the Brotmuseum
Trying my best, formatting on mobile is an absolute pain in the ass /:
Probably because the 4 locations are counted as one
Edit: also idk if it‘s the biggest, it‘s just one of the biggest in central europe and the oldest in austria
I think they wanted to expand but there are still only 8 in Austria and half of them in Vienna
Never have been in one tbh
There are 8 of them in the country, 5 of them are in Vienna
As a non-viennese I never had KFC
There are 8 in the whole of Austria
And not a single one in the west where I live
So if wanted to go to a KFC it would be shorter for me to go into another country cause I live closer to the KFC in Munich than to every other KFC in Austria
I didnt even know we had one
But honestly, why get KFC when you could have styrian backhendlsalat instead
We have two (I think) here around Linz and I don´t think they get that much business
In the end I think they are just way too expensive for what they offer
I didn't even know there was that many
I thought it was like 4 overall 2 in vienna, one in Innsbruck and a last one somewhere else, Salzburg maybe
There is no KFC in Ibk, There are 5 in vienna, 1 in Linz, 1 in Graz and 1 in Ansfelden
[Source]
There's one in linz
How have i never noticed that one even though I'm in linz pretty often
I don't know, I'm hardly ever in Linz
But since there is also a leberkas pepi in linz I don't think I would ever even think about going to KFC
I’ve had KFC in Romania, Austria, Germany, Czechia and Slovakia (haven’t been to Poland yet, nor to the US)
But my foreign friends and me agree the romanian one it’s vastly superior in taste than any other we’ve tasted
I can’t explain why, but I’m assuming in Poland it’s the same
I live in Austria now, but I hardly ever go to KFC because it’s just soo bad
Whenever I go back home, waiting in a big line for KFC is always on my bucket list (pun intended)
McDonald’s is considerably better in Austria though
It‘s very probable
A lot of eastern european franchises are polish-owned
Now you can add one more thing on your to do list when you go to Romania
I sure added the KFCs for Poland
Don‘t forget to order the Glenn garlic sauce
It‘s an experience in itself
Beware though that sometimes KFC has meh days
Food’s still better than in the west, but it‘s not amazing as usual
But don‘t limit yourself to chicken wings, Romania has a lot of other good things to offer ;)
That‘s actually a good point
Afaik prices in Poland and Romania are equally low
Even our currencies the złoty and the leu are almost 1:1 in parity
Exactly the same here, although I don't have any hard numbers to support my impression
But I have the same feeling (and I think it's like that among my family, families I know and circle of friends) just like you said
What counts as "being able to cook"? Like ... what level are we talking about
Wennst ned krandln konnst findsd en Lebtog long kan monn, so yes
> Fresh meals are healthier and cheaper than takeaway
so takeaways aren't fresh meals in your opinion
I've got several restaurants in my area that have takeout that is much better than what most people could cook themselves and it's "healthy" food
>  full English breakfasts, Spaghetti Bolognese, various meals with Chicken and rice or chicken and potatoes etc, made fried chicken and fish and chips and burgers during the lockdown too, homemade pizzas etc
That doesn't sound too basic
Not sure about the part about the men
Men do cook waaay more than it was common in earlier times but I wouldn't say that men are usually cooking more advanced than women
That being said from my point of view it is absolutely true that cooking becomes less important
I don't know a single person who likes to cook, everybody I know is eating no breakfast or something cold, eats lunch at work and then eats bread for dinner at home
At the weekend they eat out
I have a DINK couple as friends, they use their kitchen about once a month
And thats not even the typical "I am like that so my friends are like that too" situation
I personally cook and bake a lot
But I think it is not that easy to find Austrians that cook dishes from scratch
My foreign husband realized that at some point and he thinks it is really weird how little Austrians cook in general and when I am abroad (of course not when I am just a tourist) I notice it too
> Till the 90s the "traditional norm" was for a women to cook for the family and pretty much expected
Yes, except if it comes down to BBQ, men did that while women prepared the salads
In my family my mother cooked most of the time, but my dad made the Schnitzel
In my experience, it's like the society has shifted into 2 groups - people who cook and those who don't, very much like people who read and those who don't.
You sound like a peach
Dear readers: Cooking and experimenting with new reipes and types of food is a very common thing among women and men in Austria (equally in my experience), enjoyed by many, countryfolk and city folk alike
Cooking and baking some nice treat when friends of family are over is widespread, basic cooking skills are taught in school, girls and boys equally
As you (probably) know, eating is a **serious** past-time here and we have a huge variety from Corinthian Kasnudeln, Lower Austrian Mohntorte to classic Viennese Schnitzel, Influenced by the former countries of the Austrian Empire all the way up to to Asian Cuisine
When I was a student, making marmelade was a really big trend among my fellow Uni peers (and is ofc still today), today making your own sausage and curing meat seems to be the latest trend with the young hip crowd
For example, a couple of weeks ago, the volunteers (high school age) on night shift at our local EMT station point baked several cakes for the staff when the calls were down, just because they could
Which was super lovely of them
I have rarely met anyone in Austria who hasn't had at least average cooking skills
> selling all kinds of premade packs of herbs and spices for specific meals that require minimal thinking from the one who prepares the food
If you are only cooking occasionally (and only for one person) these premade packs make a lot of sense, if it comes down to things that can go bad
I'd rather buy something that is measured out to be the amount you need for a portion than throwing away stuff I don't need
We used to have it, but it was removed in the 80s or 90s I think
I also don't think it's necassary in the age of the internet, where instructions for any dishes or techniques are available online
>I don't know a single person who likes to cook, everybody I know is  eating no breakfast or something cold, eats lunch at work and then eats  bread for dinner at home
What the fuck kind of weird social circle do you both have, lol
You have no aunt or friend or neighbour who cooks like
normal people
Your Mama and Oma don't cook and bake
And I even googled that if anyone did a study on how much Austrians cook at home
[Unsuprisingly alot] which alligns with the emphasis on things like wide-available orgainc meat and vegetables, local (regional) products, the popularity of having your own vegetable garden, the tons of country cooking magazines and books, that you couldn't buy a single cube of yeast for weeks while quarantaine, because everyone was baking like galore
and everything else what I always considered normal here
I think that's a level that most people manage and is kinda expected
Lebtog bedeutet das ganze Leben lang
On the countryside it‘s still common in middle schools to teach cooking and housekeeping
Here in the US most restaurants have a take out option and there are a lot of healthy options, at least here in California
And well even if it's not healthy on an absolute scale, I don't see how the food from a restaurant would be necessarily less healthy than the same dish made at home
But that statement about the UK fascinates me
Indian food is big there and there are definitely Indian dishes you can fit in a healthy diet
Or do they not offer take-out
Well, I dont know my neighbors - otherwise no family or friends who *really* cook
Of course sometimes they are cutting some mushrooms into the pasta sauce or they are frying meat and then they eat it with some french fries from the freezer section, etc
Once in a while they maybe cook a soup or a rice pan (if you can say it like that in English
But regular cooking
That is a very uncommon thing here imho
Especially if you compare it with other nations where it is normal to eat every day a self made meal in the evening, maybe even with a self made soup or salad or combined with left-overs from the previous day
Like I said, I dont know any Austrian who does that
Cooking is only a hobby in Austria
> I know very little women who are able to cook advanced meals (cooking  noodles and throwing in a can of tuna or making an omelette is not  cooking in my book)
It's mainly men not only knowing how to cook but  wanting it, trying out new things and so on
That's what you said
Also, then you are talking from a very individual experience, because in my social circle (VERY big family, located all over Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol and Vienna) as well among my work peers (medical field) and my friends and aquaintances, average is the standard and advanced at least a hobby
I know nobody whose standard meal is "Mikrowelle und Kebap".
Where do you live
I know alot of Austrians who do that
I do that
My Mom does that, my friends do that, the ones with kids alot, my aunts do that, my neighbors do that
the weird lady who sits the entrance at my workplace and who lives with six cat brings her homemade casseroles in a Tupperwear box
I mean she told me she shares the plate with her cats, which is insane, but she throws that ones together herself
You mom never cooked or baked whatever is typical for the federal state you grew up, or Austria
No fish and game, which is just delicious
No homemade Rindssuppe, where you eat the beef cold cutted
Nix Strudel und Weihnachtskekse
No big family gatherings where it's Oma kocht + pot-luck style dishes from the rest of the family/relatives
Nothing of that
Lol that's sad
On the other hand I definitely also know people who would burn water
Strange, my go-to indian restaurant here has quite a lot of option that I would consider on the healthy side
Their aloo gobi is amazing
I live in Styria and I am in my mid-thirties, so I know lots of families too
And of course there are people who *occasionally* cook or bake
Like I said, it is a hobby and some people like it
I do not know a single Austrian person - my mother included - who cooks really regularly, if they are in the mood for it or not
And therefore I don't know anybody who thinks cooking is an important and basic life skill
No, I have no idea, because that never happened to me nor did I experience that -  when my 12yr old cousin invites her school friends over to hang out, they often cook or bake something they found on social media or YT, just for fun
And I am not a lucky person, I am a average person with average experiences
We're the same age and I live in Lower Austria, close to Vienna
Weird then;)
Well, I am glad it is totally different in my family and among my social circle, because I love trying out new culinary things, inviting friends and being invited, high quality ingredients and all the joyfull, gmiadliche package
And my mom cooks six days out of seven and even her Restl dishes (left-overs) are delicious:D
And I do honestly think it's a bit of typical Austrian "sudern" involved here, because there's a pattern with you and the other poster: Both of you say "Austrians can't cook", EXCEPT you both (that other dude included also his friends and granny, but no girls lol), who are indeed Austrian, and claim to love advanced cooking/cooking and baking alot ...;)
I actually never said I love cooking :D not a big fan, but I find it necessary
But this kinda proofs my point:  in Austria typically only people who are into cooking cook regularly
I said I cook a lot and you assumed I must love it then :)
Pity you don’t do then:) Maybe we should also add it’s also a Family Background thing: I grew up with a mom who was food-concerned and cooked meals for us everyday and the big family gatherings, like at Christmas, were and are joyfully full of great homecooked treats
it’s a thing you take into adulthood
It was the standard with my family and also with my schoolmates families
I do see that not everyone has that
Croatia and, to a lesser degree, Poland
AUT - FR, NL, LUX - BEL in some way too - DNK
Scheanan cake day
Man
It's lonely
&nbsp;
^(my goodness, that should be their new official tourist slogan)
Mainly because of Silesia which I kind of view as a "next door"-region to Austria
You might thank Sobieski for that
There's many descendents from Galicians in Vienna
You can still see the cultural ties with last names and cuisine for instance
Why in the way
Our southern most province is never in the way
Now go to sleep lower styria
You're just the slavizised Austrians to our austrianized Slavs
see it more like, in the middle
you're only not mentioned because of the "no common borders" requirement in the question, mountain brothers
And Austria did not exist after WW2 - so guess it does not feel the same anymore :D
Nah
Sobieski isnt that important for that
Its the influx of many Polish and historically many Polish Jews that seriously left their mark in local culture eg in Vienna
I at first really had to think what you even mean by that
And I don‘t think it‘s a thing in Austria, sure everything is christmas themed, but it usually isn‘t a traditional or national thing
I‘m not sure tho, so it would be nice if another Austrian could confirm or deny that
Btw merry christmas in advance to anybody reading this
Hope all of you have been staying healthy and that your christmas and new year will be awesome (:
Can't tell
I was too young to remember
Was in Berlin with my class last year
We were at the "S-Bahn" station and a teacher lost his second trousers on the tracks
He jumped off and took them back
I know it's dangerous but we all found that funny at that moment and the people where like "Those teens are weird and the teacher isnt a good role model"
I don't know why but I like to watch the people there
I was in Sarvar several times and it's kind of calming to see the people there
Don't know why
They don't get that much salary as we do (No, I don't mass shop in Hungary because it's cheaper there for us)
Visited Etna
It was my first time exploring a Vulcano
I love Vulcanoes and I was like "OMG I'm gonna see a Vulcanoe" And it also was my first time on an island
Visited Winkelgasse
But I also visited a bit of the beautiful Scottish landscape and a Loch (I think it was Mormond but I'm not sure)
(Had the accommodation in Edinburgh near the sea :3)
Breathtaking xD
The longest Rodelbahn :D
If you need the name it's Zinkenstüberl ^^
The first time I come to a city I always take a day to just walk around as randomly as I can without ever looking at a map
Can only recommend it
Sometimes you end up admiring the posh area with all the embassies and sometimes you end up in a pub in a weird area with locals who speak very little English
Good times
Just read up on him, how lucky us Austrians have no connection to him whatsoever
Vorarlberg once wanted to join Switzerland but Switzerland doesn't want them
Otherwise there simply are not separatist movements
Is it a secessionist movement if the other parts of Austria want to sell burgenland
Probably Vorarlberg to join Switzerland cause they share the same dialect and actually tried once
Alternatively, Burgenland or Kärnten
mostly because we would sell them to Hungary and Slovenia respectively
I think they should join Austria, together with southern tyrol
I mean there isn't really that much left of Austria
Who knows, maybe they regularily even try to do it now too, but it's just that nobody in the rest of Austria understands them
They should try Liechtenstein, maybe they want them
Remember the time back in 2012 when a small island of Greece wanted to become a part of Austria
That would have been weird
[Article] (in German)
We were kinda seperated from 95% of our land already
But where would we keep our Burgen
also south tyrol
Time to take back Hungary so we can also have seperatist movements
"The rest is Austria"
There's plenty of cellar space in lower austria
You can have both
A half eaten fleischkassemml and a six pack of the cheapest beer you can find, as well as the fact that slovakia with burgenland sticking out of it would look hilarious on a map
Shhhhh
Taking the first numbers that come up in Google - Germany has a gdp of 3
8 trillion
Bavara a gdp of 600 billion and BaWü of 500 billion
Jesus, that map would look disgusting
There are no stray dogs in Austria afaik
I also remember the super surprised look on a Romanian exchange student when she asked what is being done about stray dogs in Austria and I told her that there are none
In Austria too, we started writing practice with pencils and then switched to fountain pens
After I'd moved on from elementary school, teachers didn't care anymore so most of us switched to regular pens within a couple years
Granted tho, that was 20 years ago
I don't know whether this is still relevant nowadays
The problem is the ink
Writing right to left, your hand will smear the ink when you write with the left hand
Here it is the same
The only parents where from the birthday child
Some Parents Like to stay, some Parents Bring only the kids, both is Welcome at my Home
My Kids are small enough that the Garden is fun enough to Entertain them without additional Input, I Just watch over No Body gets hurt
I had 2 parents stay once for my kid's party
It was ... awkward
> I have a bonus question: is it common in other countries to have one “kid birthday” with friends as described in this post and then another “adult birthday”/“family birthday” with family
Yes
Very common
Most of us wouldn't even have the space to host that many kids
We live in the capital, right in the center
Kid went out on her own (with her friends, but without adults) since she was around 9 or 10
It's really like how safe it is here
I suppose it's only a problem for classic suburbia or in big car dependent cities
Not really too much
It is part of some Austrian literature and depends heavily on the German teacher
There is some emphasis on Austrian standard German in distinction to the German standard German  (which colloqially is called Bundesdeutsch) - iE not using the Duden but a distinct Austrian dictionary in school
Dialects though are a central part of local culture both in every day life, music, theatre ....
"Das österreichische Wörterbuch". It is distinct in that it uses Austrian words and gramatical versions that are unique to Austria
iE Singular/Plural and form of file
In Austria it is der Akt/die Akte in German it is die Akte/die Akten
Leberkassemmerl, Bifana and Kebab
Leberkassemmel mit Gurkerl
Mustard, soft cheese, capers and sliced picled onions
Preferably in dark rye bread
Or just a Leberkassemmerl
Leberkassemmel has been mentioned here before
What I personally love to prepare for myself is a sandwich which is built like this:
- Tramezzini bread with a thin layer of mayonaise
- chili flakes
- salami calabrese (spianata calabra to be exact)
- gouda (just normal, young one, the cheese shouldn´t be too dominant in taste in this sandwich imo)
- pickles (essiggurkerl, bevorzugt scharfe) (just make sure to drain the liquid with kitchenpaper before you put them in)
- and then the same stuff again backwards
[this one] from syracuse
([second video] faster but worse picture quality)
keep watching until the omelette part at the end
Kaiser roll, butter, raw sliced onions, thinly sliced smoked salmon
Done
Leberkassemmerl ftw
(und als Linzer: Am liebsten vom Leberkaspepi
Oh, it is senor
[Here is some local folklore about it
] <3
Sure, there’s also Kasleberkassemmerl and Pferdeleberkassemmerl (my personal favorite, because horse meat is great)
Search for the word in /r/Austria and there are quite a few posts
Hab in Wien a nu koane guadn gfundn
Oba in Portugal war‘s guad
Well, yes
A Döner Kebab (or just Kebab for short in German)
It's basically very finely ground sausage meat in loaf form, baked in the oven, cut into slices and put in a Kaiserroll
You can get this hot in most grocery stores, many bakeries, butchers etc
as a to go meal or, if you are that hungry, to eat in the store while you shop
But the taste is seriously addicting IMHO
Sure, there are differences in taste depending on brand, but while I like some less than others, I've never met a Leberkäse I didn't want to eat
The taste is not really that similar to regular sausage
I don't know what exactly they do with it to make it taste so good but I suspect lard is involved
The name is a bit misleading
Translated it means livercheese, but it contains neither liver nor cheese
There are variants that do contain cheese but they are called Käsleberkäse (cheeslivercheese)
Apparently the liver part of the word is from a word meaning leftovers and the cheese part refers to the loaf shape
It's leberkäse or leberkas - semmel means breadroll
I haven't heard that song in ages
Aaah, the song of my people
reminds me of [this one]
I would rather compare it to a slightly fattier and softer/spongier Frankfurter/Wiener sausage in serious formats (a full block of Leberkäse has a few kg and about the size of a packaged sliced square sandwich bread)
Maybe also a bit like [this song about Schnitzl]
„Benutzername prüft aus“ darad ma drüman auf /r/de jiatzad song
It’s not in German
Frankfurters are made from finely ground sausage meat :)
It's all Brät - ground meat, but the texture depends on how fine or coarse it's ground and also how fatty/lean the meat is

I guess it is that the last government got suspended and the so called “expert government” is the first in years to actually make wise decisions
The conservative party (whom I personally dislike more than the far-right) under Sebastian "Ohrban" Kurz is having some fuckups that might influence the election result in September
They are still projected to gain, so I'm not holding my breath
IIRC the EU already banned plastic bags starting somewhere in the 2020s.
sadly that will end way too soon
and one of the biggest asshats is finally out of the game which is also nice
>might influence the election result in September
Don't kid yourself
Their target group believed every ridiculous spin on such news stories so far and most of them are older, so may not even know what a hard drive is
Stand up comedy, that is
I am sure he will return somehow, they always find ways
Logic and facts at work
Because with the far-right I think many at least genuinely care for the future of their countries and Europe
With the current conservatives I never have that feeling
They literally have no reason to exist other than make politics for themselves and their wealthy backers (i.e. "the rich", cliche as it may sound)
Much moreso than the far-right, they stand for erosion of the middle class, dismantling the welfare state, and privatisation
They are literallly *the* enemy of the common people, in my opinion anyway
"Er ist wieder da"
>Because with the far-right I think many at least genuinely care for the future of their countries and Europe
Lol
It's been, like, 2 months since Ibiza
Of course some of the policies he is pushing for more less reality in Europe but overall I think he is still a fair bit more left than most European politicians
I haven't heard of them gaining any political relevance
Taking a look at their website, at first glance their party program actually looks pretty reasonable (apart from the obvious, ridiculous pipe dream of Habsburg restoration)
I would unironcially be in favour of restoring the monarchy if there was a real chance, but that ship has sailed forever
Calling yourself a socialist=/=being a socialist
Austria is a republic because after the fall of the Habsburgs and being forbidden to join Germany, there really weren't many other options
The proclamation of the republic was a "guess we're doing that now" type situation
But in my opinion the mentality of Austrians is very much still "monarchist", even if they don't consciously realize it
We like to suck up to authority and stick to a "traditional order".
If it would magically happen with a nice job and everything, then Switzerland
Just for fun
I'd probably prefer Switzerland as a country in general but I could imagine myself living in Hamburg or Leipzig
I wouldn't mind to move abroad for a while to work
But with these options I would stay in Vienna
I love that city
Germany, Altschauerberg
I'd stay in Vienna, why would I move
If I had to choose another place, I'd probably go to Hamburg
For a moment I thought this was a dig at Swiss German, then I remembered
riiight, *French*.
The "hate" thing isn't that much better in Vienna, even though I'm not sure that I'd call it hate
I mean in sports we usually cheer for the team Germany plays against and you might get some weird looks for using words like "Quark" or Schorle", but mostly it isn't meant completely serious
The only thing we're not joking about is sauce on schnitzel
I mean, I'd say most of us are closer to the sea than most Germans
A so a bledsinn, mi vastead awoi jeda
Where have you been, if I may ask
Slovenian is even an official minority language here, so you get a translator if you need one
They've got a very large Portuguese community in Switzerland though
Mh, after over 30 years something new would be fun
Altough living right next to Slovenia rocks of course :D
I really love doing weekend trips and theres only so much you can do and so far you can go for a weekend
I would love to be in Switzerland and explore the region and the neighboring countries
Hungarians (and czechs, slovakians and croats, tough not slovenians) are our national bros
At least from what I expirienced, you just go over the border, adapt to the language or switch to english and youre right at home
Now kiss
Bei uns dadat ma eh nix lernan miassn

Ok wow I took a long time to understand that
I'm ashamed of myself
If a little reality-altering makes you happy I say go for it
I guess it comes from history or then it is a typical love hate relationship some countries share, especially when one country is considered like a sibling but gets more attention for being "fancier, more famous" or whatsoever
I found Finns share the same sentiment towards Sweden, for example (but correct me if I am wrong)
It could very well similar to the feeling certain regions share with the capital (Wien vs
Tirol for example)
Anyway, I wouldn't say Austrians have a stereotypical dislike for Germany as a whole
Austrians will often stress that Bavaria is different to the rest of Germany, maybe because it is culturally same same but different
And then I wouldn't call it hate or dislike either
For most people it is more like teasing your sibling
Btw
I also heard Germans making fun of Austrians for our dialects
Even though I know that it doesn't occur to the same extend I feel like this stereotypical jokes are somewhat mutual
Lakes are just as lovely
I mean, Graz is kind of awesome
I went there three times with friends and we always met a lot of people and had amazing experiences
Also in Vienna there is a fuckload to events
May I ask what did you do when you were here and also where you are from
Slovenia is indeed lovely
Although I‘m not kidding unlike those [Brexiteers]
Ive actually been in Slovenia just yesterday and had a great time :) apart from the unfortunately not that good prekmurska gibanica
Well I mean, sLOVEnia has love in it

You are definitely right
Finding interesting events or happenings is quite difficult when you are traveling and craving for something not that touristy
It often takes knowledge of a city or the right pages (facebook, instagram) where to look
It probably really depends what you compare it to and what you expect
I am originally from a village with 700 people so going to Vienna or Graz was always an adventure for me
> I love Budapest
\- Brits, probably
The word you are looking for is „oligarchy“.

Not very common
There's a plan to move more institutions away from Vienna, but currently only 5 (National Environmental Office in Klosterneuburg, National Office for Water Management in Scharfling, the Austrian National Forestry in Purkersdorf, the National Office for Viniculture in Eisenstadt and the National Center for Language Competence) of 68 National Institutions are not in the capital, and 2 of those are in suburbs
Relocating the Environmental Office to Klosterneuburg was one of the most obvious "lets do some stupid shit that makes our promise technically true" that I have ever seen
Yes, you moved it out of Vienna - but only by one mile
Yes it’s true

There are lot's of more examles on the tip of my tongue, but at the moment I can't quite think of them
Maybe somebody else can help out
Good point
Every second hipster shop that's remotely connected to producing something is calling itself a M A N U F A K T U R nowadays
Other good examples for hipster lingo come to mind, mostly in English and especially in connection to the whole "art of manliness" movement: bespoke; artisan; anything else
fun fact: the chinese wanted to bring comrade (Tóngzhì) back into the political sphere, but stopped once they realised gay chinese men already used the term as slang for themselves
You don't. There's no other word, but to talk about honor *at all* sounds dangerously right-wing reactionary to German ears
It was replaced by Anstand (decency), Würde (dignity) and some other words
There isn't and there's nothing old fashioned about the word
Don't know where he got that from
Had kind of a renaissance due to the influence of Turkish notions of honour though
At least that's where I feel the whole Ehrenmann thing is coming from, together with "Küss dein Auge" etc
More proper would be "Es ist mir eine Ehre ..." and then the other person can reply "Die Ehre ist ganz meinerseits
In any case, such phrases are so old-fashioned (like powdered wig old-fashioned) that anybody who uses them does so ironically

What is the point is that guns aren't "personal freedom" for everyone, but kind of a sport to which you have to be trained
and  are very good reports of the daily show
I'm Austrian and it's not easy to buy guns here, but in my community many people own guns which they got from their grandfather
But when I see somebody holding a gun, I'm totally chilled, because a) almost all (male) Austrians are trained on guns due to milliary service, b) they're not holding guns to "defend" themselves, but to go hunting
But if I go to any other country without a shooting tradition and/or universal millitary service, I'm actually scared of people wearing guns, even when it's the police
I'm not saying, that America should make an universal millitary service or that they should steal the chilled culture, but they maybe should reevaluate what can they actually do better without saying "in Switzerland it works too so we can have our guns wherever and whenever you want". Even in Switzerland, nobody is wearing guns
Lot of people has them at home and they use it in competitions or in the woods, but often they don't even have munition at home
>The problem is American culture
I wouldn't exactly say culture
Most of it are social and socioeconomic problems that have to be dealt with
Also the lack of (mental) health care makes it even worse
Banning the guns won't stop the massacres
You gotta tackle the problem at its root
Its actualy very easy to get a gun here
Category C, D are unregulated, you just need to be over 18 and without a criminal record
For category B, the test is easier than getting a driving license
Oh like "a well regulated militia"
Damn, it seems like developers aren't even building small apartments 'cause if you can afford to buy one, you can also afford to buy an expensive one

"and it has these four, down there, you know

Icelandic is super cool IMO
Icelandic
It's in my personal opinion and I mean this without any offense, the most elegant and melodic of the languages I've crossed paths with
Danish & Swedish both sound too much like a very weird twisted version of German with some uncommon sounds, while Finnish is just a bit too far from my Indo-European expectations
Norwegian is quite nice actually but has imo the same problem as many sequels in movies
The cypriots over at r/AskEurope always tell us that you guys basically feel at home in Greece anyways :P
I'll be here for Liechtenstein
Do you feel at home in Germany
Liechtenstein can into mircostate that is part of GB
Austrian here: The *new" ss-ß rule
And by new I mean from around 1996
Until then you basically had to know which word you write with a double "ss" and which one with a sharp "s". Then they made it simpler: If "ss", the vocal before is spoken short; if "ß", the vocal beforebis long
Only that people got completely confused and write how they want
Especially in the last years you keep seeing the word "Strasse" more and more, even by big companies, although it is just wrong
C'mon people, it looks horrible and it is not that hard
We're sharing borders with 8 countries, which is the closest
Ok, let's get started
Germany: instant war about who is better
Czech Republic: remove your fucking atmonic litter from our border
Slovakia: (I know too less about Slovakia)
Hungary: welcome back :)
Slovenia: (I know too less about Slovenia)
Italy: give us Südtirol back, then we are cool
Switzerland: oh that would be great for us but bad for Swiss people :0
Liechtenstein: Well
still protected by Switzerland but a small cutie :3

I don't think a country stretching from Bregenz to Ushgorod without the same distance north-south could work in any way

As a kid I was 100% sure that Sweden is where Switzerland is and Switzerland is where Sweden is
I thought, that there is no good beer in southern countries

Idky, it just sounds french
I thought (until now) that only in Germany they limitless
It's simple : there are no kangaroos in Austria ;)
Well, in a way they do, it's just called Swiss german

Yes

If there are enough kids to justify an extra table, it's common
If there's not enough space around the main table, yes
At my grandma's it was always in the next room, though only five meters from the main table, really
That way the kids can be louder and talk to their cousins rather than get bored/annoy the adults
Around 13/14 or so each of us decided we were grown and wanted to sit at the adults' table, only to quickly regret as we grew bored
So now, when all of us are grown, we still insist on sitting at the kids' table, though usually Grandma joins us now
She's a kid at heart

Be careful with the not dying

Austria: No, it's not an issue, as long as it's not smelly food and not eaten too close to other people (on public transport or the like)
Answering for some other countries I know: It seems to be an issue in France, Spain, Indonesia, Japan
Mostly not for the food itself, but for lack of grace or seemingly "not having your life together" – after all, who in their right mind would want to eat while walking even though it's a) unhealthy b) hard to enjoy your food that way c) kinda sad and lonely and lastly d) dirty and kinda disorderly
Interestingly, some of these countries (Indonesia, Japan) on the other hand have not problem with wolfing your food down like you haven't seen any food in a month (seriously, in Japan the parents are scolding their skids to eat *faster* because they're eating too slow)
This shows that in the end what's acceptable is very arbitrary and culturally defined, and that "upsetting your stomach by eating too fast" is probably a made-up "issue" just like that as well
Note that also in these countries, a continuum exists from accepting to condescending from city to countryside and from younger to older people
So, among your teenage friends in the city it might be ok (althoug I'm kinda sceptical for Japan on this one; they *really* don't eat on the go), for your grandma in some rural part of the country it might me highly disturbing
Leberkäsesemmerl sales would hit rock bottom
It would kill the Leberkäse industry
Idk sitting on a bench and eating a Leberkassemmel is totally fine, but walking and eating would be considered inappropriate
At least by the old people in my village
The horror
But they have the Leberkas recipe
"The major problem—*one* of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them
To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must *want* to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job
" - Douglas Adams
I thought it was quite befitting for our relationship with leadership
"Austria is the only country that gets dumber from experience".
-Attributed to Karl Kraus
Odd choice
who said that and how does it fit your country
In Austria there are three Supreme courts
The „Supreme Court“ - OGH, Oberster Gerichtshof
The „Constitution Court“ VfGH, Verfassungsgerichtshof
The „Administration Court“ VWGH, Verwaltungsgerichtshof
The first is responsible for civil and criminal cases, the second one decides wether a law, act or sentence is in accordance with the constitution and human rights and the last of them is responsible for all trials regarding the city, county, state or federal administration, this also includes traffic fines or construction projects
Most of the time you can not call one of them directly but have to have a trial at one of the “lower” courts first
Only the constitution court could be called nearly anytime you think a law is not in accordance with the constitution
Court decisions in Austria can not develop the law which means all of those courts could literally decide differently any other time and they can and do disagree on each other’s decision
Austrian dialekt numbers are of course build like the german ones but we have other bullshit when it comes to numbers
Counting from one to twelve (in dialekt):
Oans, zwoa, drä, fia, fümf, segs, siem, ocht, nä, zehn, ööf, zwöf
The name of the digits
Add mostly an a to the end except for fia and nä who change to fiara and näna since else it sounds stupid
If you know the exact count of something you use one of two versions
If you add what you are refering to after the number you use, like the germans, the counting ones (one is the exception, both high german and dialekt specify if the thing you are refering to is male, female or nether by using one of three versions of one)
If you don't add what you are refering to to the end but it has to be figured out from the context you use a new number system that standard german doesn't have (technicly it was once part of the standard but noone used it in standard german so they removed it)
You add an e sound to the end for a count of 1 or between 5 and 19 (except for 7) and a ge for 20-99 (from where it skips 100 and restarts at 101 from the beginning), seven changes from siem to siewane for some reason, 4 changes from fia to fiare,  two and three don't have such a form (and therefor also 102, 103, 202, 203
), 100, 1000, 1000,... also don't have such a form
And now comes the biggest bullshit, there are special words in standard german for 100, 1000, 10000,... that also are just 100, 1000, 10000,... with an e at the end of the word, these words have the meaning, significantly more then 100, 1000, 10000,... , and the dialekt versions also have this meaning, therefor you have numbers that are build like the words that reference an exact number of things but don't reference an exact number
And thats bullshit as fuck and i had to explain that hole number mess to a german student who was fucking confused about the numbers the professor in front of him was using and why he was using "multiple versions so inconsistently".
Thank you for coming to my rant about numbers
In Romania all military establishments belong to the Ministry of Defence
Old bases either are continued to be used, or are left abandoned
However even for the latter the ministry almost never ceases the right of property to local municipalities for further development
There's the Arsenal Vienna which was built as a military base in the 19th century after the 1848 revoultion, in order to control future uprisings and revolts
Basically, the 19-year-old monarch Franz Joseph had it personally commissioned, so he could bombard his own people in case they became "unruly" again
[It's built like a fortress] and stands on a hill, [commanding the entire inner city] You could literally shoot 19th century artillery directly into the city from there
Nowadays the main building the museum for military history and houses decommisioned old artillery, tanks and airplanes
The surrounding buidlings (orignally barracks) are partly used by the Austrian military, partly as civilian residential houses
The flats are quite nice there, and it has a lot of open green space around and between and it's right next to a big park (Schweizergarten)
There's also a huge workshop of the federal theaters there, where they produce big stage set pieces, and they have rehearsal stages there
The building complex is quite nice actually, has an Arab/Spanish touch, with lots of Arabesques
[This is the gatehouse of the front building] the [Arsenal church in the back of the complex] the [frontside] and the [backside of the museum] one of the [residential buildings] that's the [tennis center] and here's a [historic illustration] (I think a number of objects were bombed away in WWII)
Since I live nearby, I like going on walks there
I’m most surprised with the small percentage of conservatives
Opus (even from my home town) and Falco
Darius and Finlay, Falco
Let's not forget the magic that is Lordi
Aren't they Moldavian
I haven't heard about any of those tbh
Well then they aren't from your country as of 2019 nevertheless
>Haven't you heard this
Nope
I'm neither into Metal, nor into (modern) Pop, so that might explain my ignorance :)
I didn't know that most of them have Romanian citizenship to be honest
I guess it's also a different way of thinking
For instance I'd never consider a German-speaking South Tyrolean an Austrian, even though they are basically indistinguishable from "our" Tyroleans
I actually knew at least one of the artists mentioned in all the other replies, yes
Depends if your in the city or in a rural village
I grew up in a rural area and you’d just greet anyone everywhere
It’s considered impolite if you do not
Now I live in the next city for University purposes and it’s kind of the other way round
If you greet someone you don’t know you get a weird look
> In Flemish Dutch ‘poep’ means the butt and ‘poepen’ is the verb for having sex
Uh, what would buttsex be then
Poeppoepen
Grab em by the pussy
Theres also "laufen" which means "running" in Austria and "walking" in Germany
Its so confusing
"Ich laufe zur Bibliothek" --> my first reaction is to think of a burning library or something
Also "anfahren" which in Germany means starting to drive and here driving into something
I scheiß mi au
I had no idea that this isn't said in Germany
I would say my favourite false friend is "laufen", which exclusively means "running" in Austria, but is walking in Germany and "rennen" is running
In Austria, "rennen" is also running and my brother was once instructed by a German acquaintance to walk "laufen" somewhere and when he literally started running the dude shouted "ich hab gesagt laufen, nicht rennen
" (I told you to run (ie walk), not run
Which was hilarious
TIL and TIL for both of these
One more thing I want to add is "sich ausgehen", which is a super practical expression with the meaning of "to suffice". It's not used (sometimes not even understood) in Germany, and while it wouldn't get me in a tight situation, I often struggle trying to replace it with other words because it's so common here, for anything from resources ("der Einkauf geht sich mit einem Zehner aus" - our shopping will be below 10 euros), to space ("geht sich das im Kofferraum aus" - will that fit in the trunk), to time ("der frührere Zug geht sich aus" - we'll make the earlier train)
Isnt laufen running and rennen running fast
I dialect or imprecise speech it is commonly used though: "Was hat dir der Lehrer heute gelernt
" sounds much more natural to me than "Was hat er dich gelehrt", that would sound quite formal, maybe even a bit archaic
It's because Austrian German is more conservative than German-German
So apparently it shares a bunch of older vocabulary and other traits with Dutch
Many Germans have told me that a lot of Austrian vocabulary is understandable, but sounds really old-fashioned, like middle-ages old-fashioned
Like the word for *clothes*: *Gewand/Gwandl (*A-G) vs
*Kleidung/Kleider* (G-G)
I thought that "geil" for a food was about being overly fat, not overly sweet
Pretty popular
It's a very common sight if you walk on the streets
Quite popular with males from ~20 to ~40
I feel like 40 is the age, where the popularity drops slightly, but in my age group it's very popular
I think only 1 friend of mine is really "clean shaven", everyday
It ranges from a few days stubble to quite a full beard
Nothing crazy in my circle of friends though
I'd guess most are just to lazy to shave every day, since it's such a nuisance
In Greece, where I grew up, it's pretty common
In Austria, where I live now, it's not THAT popular and I might get some comments like "Taliban" which I reply that most philosophers and scientists of the ancient world had beards
But it is mostly acceptable and women like it
A bit of „salt“ looks really good though
I'm optimistic only to be disappointed later
As always
I don't think we'll make it into the knock-out stage
What Sport are we talking
Or is this just a joke where everyone just pretends to know
(apparently I don't get it
Our squad is pretty strong, but Foda is just an idiot
We should still be able to get out of our group, but everything more would be a huge surprise to me tbh
Everything other than a complete humiliation is a win in my book
We have a chance this time around
Ukraine is doable on a good day and well beating Makedonia is a necessity to advance
Not seeing any points against the Netherlands
Honestly I think 3 points may be enough to advance and 4 is almost a safe-call for knock-out stage
With our performance lately you may really have a chance
Scotland definitly has seen better times but the Austrian team has had them too
I'd say they are roughly equal as has the draw in the first game shown
Probably will be a fight between Denmark, Austria and Scotland
Denmark might be a tid bit stronger than the other two but all three are roughly in the same category of B-List countries
Our coach is a fucking idiot, so there's definitely a chance you'll finish above us (although drawing against Israel doesn't really help Scotland's case either)
Honestly I think in your group only two will advance, I have a feeling someone will lose against the other two world class countries and will end up with to few points to advance as third
American-football, Fistball, indoor athletics, volleyball, baseball, triathlon, enduro, gymnastics, rallye, Kanu, basketball, ...
On paper not, but considering the performance of Austrian teams in Euro and World Cup, you cant't be certain ;)
Last time around we went into the Euro with overconfidence and were shot down by Iceland and Hungary
Well Portugal got its feathers ruffled too and only qualified as 3rd for the Knock Out Round but they went on to win the Title
On the club level there were a few hickups in the past years but I would be a real surprise if Austria would be able to pull it off
The Oranjes always were a good competition team, Austria had its last good showing in 1954 and its last semi decent one in 1978
Yeah that was a national embarrasment
Especially afteg we kicked out the Germans 4 years earlier
The team was booed out of the airport when they returned in 82, in 78 they got a heroes welcome
French
Also French people speaking German
Hungarian
I think it's a beautiful-sounding, fascinating language which I have a personal emotional attachment to, as my grandfather is from Hungary and I'm kind of a Austria-Hungary fanboy
Spanish, but the one spoken in Latin Amerika and Central America
It's just a really beautiful language and I also enjoy visiting the different countrie there
I also like English, because it helps me talk with so many people around the world
I love it so much when I hear someone speak with a real scottish accent
Also Finnish
I Like English a lot
It has a great flow to it and it's very effective
Italian, Spanish and Japanese sound the best to me
Greek and Russian
They are a mix of beautiful and harsh
Spanish, especially if it's with a southern/Andalusian accent
The way they lisp the s's, swallow the d's and labialize the v's... so fast and rolling and fluid, yet soft
Always makes me excited to hear it, but I got a huge boner for Spanish culture in general
I love hearing people speak in korean, it just has this melody to it that i like
This
Hungarian almost sounds like a waltz to me and it’s quite deep and sensual
Feels quite comfy too (if you're from eastern Austria)
The way they darken their vowels in general, and pronounce a and á... feels right at home
Metternich was a dick to the Hungarians and Italians
John Rabe, a Nazi businessman, is celebrated as a hero in China, and had his former home repurposed as a memorial hall
He lived in Nanjing (formerly written as Nanking) during the Invasion of the Japanese army, which would be later known as "Rape of Nanjing". Before the massacres started, he, along with 14 foreign nationals (americans and europeans), formed the "International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone" and created the Nanking Safety Zone to provide Chinese refugees with food and shelter from the impending Japanese slaughter
John Rabe was elected leader and tried to stop the atrocities of the Japanese by using his rank in the NSDAP, but could only delay them
It is estimated that he saved around 200
000 - 250
000 Chinese people from certain death
He documented everything in his diaries, took films and photographs, and showed them in public lectures, but the Gestapo quickly shut this down
After the war he lost his work permit and lived in poverty with his family
Even after he passed the denazification the family lived of wild roots his children found
When the Chinese People heard about this they sent them a large sum of money and monthly food packages, to which he replied with a personal letter every time
After his death his grave was relocated to Nanjing
The public stance on all that in austria is rather .... subdued
He clearly did good with his deeds, but also was an active member of the Naziparty
As many things concerning fascism and nazism in austria, we acknowledge it, politely smile and change the subject
I was actually quit astonished when I learned that Emperor Franz Joseph is negativly viewed in Hungary, but I would guess that's  also the case in other former parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
i don't think that he is seen as anything remotly positive in austria as well
Who considers Metternich as a national hero in Austria (other than Kickl maybe)
I mean, Radetzky, yes
But Metternich
He was ousted by the German Austrians themselves in 1848 because he was so hated
But I wouldn't say he is seen positivly in Austria
For everyone with common sense he is a disgrace
I wouldn't say he's a villain here, most people probably don't know him
And although he was a member of the Nazi Party, it's safe to say he did far more good than bad stuff
After all, he saved hundreds of thousands from death and rape
He's often called "second Schindler", rightfully in my opinion
> Is he viewed positively in austria
not at all
Well he did do the austro-hungarian ausgleich, transforming the austrian empire into the austro-hungarian empire, and atleast at the end of his reign, he was generally beloved by his people
Also noting that the great cities in his empire prosperd harboring great artists and thinkers
Maybe from a modern point of view but during and after the occupation he was surely not seen in a positive light
I mean, there are memorials built for those who fought against the french occupation
No, I don't think this will ever happen with any of the official languages of the European countries
English will always be a second language
While there is more media available in English these days, people's everyday conversations are still in the countries' languages, as is TV, school, all the laws, etc
Plus, if there was a danger of English taking over I think many countries would take measures against it in order to preserve their local language and culture
That is the most Romanian way I can imagine to answer this question
If it's any consolation plattdeutsch lives on in Canada
" In den 1870er Jahren siedelten viele Mennoniten von Russland nach Kanada und in den 1920er Jahren von Kanada nach Paraguay und Mexico
Unter diesen Mennoniten wird Plattdeutsch noch als allgemeine Umgangssprache benutzt
In Kanada steigt das Interresse an Mennoniten Plattdeutsch besonders unter den Nachkommen der 1870er Russland - Kanada Ansiedler mittlerweile wieder an

I never heard about this
Given that I understand Vorarlbergerisch better than Spanish, can I now claim two additional languages
Like those people saying "I speak Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian,..."?
It was a joke but doesn't surprise me that you thought I'm serious
Good old you afterall lol
I know but no one in Austria (and to a lesser extent Germany) calls these languages by their official name
If you tell people from my area they are speaking Bavarian they'll be laughing their ass off
We refer to the area the dialect is spoken in like I did with Vorarlberg
Same with "Wienerisch", "Steyrisch", "Kärntnerisch" or in Germany "Fränkisch", "Sächsisch",..
Senner
Mountain man or woman (strangly it's regionally different If it's a men or women Jobs) who lives during Summer with the cattle of a Village on the alpine meadows and cares for them and makes cheese from their milk
Victual Brothers and Likedeelers, Pirates and privateers of the north and baltic sea
Rightfully so
In some parts of Austria Senner were mostly women
They became a symbol of freedom and free love, because the church had no rule over them when they were in they mountains
My grandfather originally learned to be a Handzuginstrumentenmacher, which was/is the profession of people who build accordions, bandoneons, harmonica and melodicas
Also a job that's very much tied to folk culture
Auf der Alm gibts keine Sünd
Apples and oranges
No, actually it's not even even that
Apples and ... battleships
Funnily as little child I always thought that means the Alm is a serene and untainted place
I don't even wanna know how many 1970s German Porno movies have exactly that title
The present's still pretty great, all things considering
Nice self-own
I have family there who I visit a lot and so many people are "apolitical". younger generations especially are sort of detached from politics
its depressing, especially in a country that had to endure so much to even have a vote
I mean its not like people talk politics and enjoy it all the time in other places, but in Poland "all politics suck and they will suck forever thats why I don't vote" seems like such a common stance to have
my honest opinion is that Poland, and this might be true in some variation for most of former "Eastern Europe", expected so much more from the EU
things improved (honestly Warsaw in the mid 90s compared to today is like night and day) but from what I remember the promises and expectations were so much bigger - wealth, freedom, equality
all of that and more
there was excitement in the air, fundamental changes for the better coming
people had this anticipation and then they got a couple new banks and supermarket chains plus some shiny office buildings and thats about it - or at least thats how its perceived
so the EU never won the hearts of people
not that other countries love the union all that much, but Poland feels like the guy who finally gets into that cool new club in town only to find out that its expensive and the music kind of sucks
people in the "West" always get mad and point to the money chart when this comes up, which to me kind of shows that there is at least some truth behind the sentiment
Hopefully no more fascist asses, that's my thought
One of my best friends is lesbian and autistic while in Poland
From what shes telling me atm I hope that it doesnt get any worse for her
Its really bad as it is
PISS, amazing name for a nazi team
that's what she said
I personally don't really see ideas of the authoritarian left (ie the marxist leninists) in the lefty parties of Europe though
Could you elaborate on what you mean by that
Thanks :)
But that's not them turning to authoritarian policies
Far from it
I do see the SocDem parties not turning a blind eye to intersectional problems really positively
But the main problem of todays social democratic parties is them buying into the neoliberal turn of the 1980s and them stopping to address concerns like housing, equal wages, etc
seriously
The SocDem parties that did fared rather well like in Portugal and Labour in GB before the whole Brexit debacle
In Malcolm in the Middle, Grete and Otto are both Scandinavian, with their accent changed accordingly (and quite hilariously: "Sieh mir in den Augeenn")
I feel they did a good job there; apart from that there's a few dubs that actually improve on the original, Kungfu Hustle comes to mind ("Ich will n Stracciatella"), as well as Leslie Nielsen and Bud Spencer/Terence Hill movies, where they add a few jokes that were obviously the result of ad-libbing, and even if it doesn't give you 100% of the original movie experience, those types of movies often fit the additional silliness
Then there's other examples where jokes are just not translated because it's either hard, or the translators are incompetent and don't fully understand the original, for example with the Simpsons ("bürgersteigsurfende Kubikstrahler", ugh)
In german it's  "mit Wasser
No idea what you watched, but it’s Schweinebacke in German
I remember one other really wierd scene from the episode "Eight Misbehavin'" (just googled it)
In the English version, Homer said "Don't worry, I've brought chloroform", and Apu says "You idiot, those are colored forms
And in German, they literally translated "colored forms" it to "kolorierte Förmchen".
Üter
The Umlauts are not optional
It's still not a real name though
Sounds very North German to me, like Lars or Ingo or Hugo
haven't heard it used in real life, though
I'll try as an outsider:

Austria as a whole has 8 IKEAs, which is more than I thought tbh
No Markus
I saw a black guy back in the early 2000s and someone screamed banana eater at him
Still makes my blood boil when I think of it, it was horrible
I also watched a few black YouTubers who shared their opinions on racism in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and it didn't sound very optimistic
One of them was even spat on
> because it can be confused with Romania or Rome
Not really a problem in German: Rumänien, Rom vs Roma & Sinti
Name me a country that is more Central European than the Czech and us
It is not always clear cut since there is always a gradient, but i think we are very clearly in central europe, geographicly and culturally
People here are getting heated over pointless arguments imo, since there is never a clear border but a gradient from one country to another
It also depends on your relative Position
Calling Trentino or Alto adige southern europe sounds silly to me
I would also never think of Slovenia or Czechia when people say Eastern Europe, but a Spaniard or Portugiese would maybe think otherwise
I would say that we're part of the DACH region
D Germany
A Austria
Ch Switzerland
I would consider Switzerland a Western European country
Or you know, being a part of the Austrohungarian Empire for about 400 years
lol
And one of our favorite past times is sit down with friends and have a mug of beer
Best trips around the time when I finished school were to the czech republic
The beer was great, the guys were funs after a few of them and the girls ... well thats another story
The girls were hot, they know
If you have weed on you in munich and the police sees you, you get a cavity search
If you have weed on you in prague and the police sees you, they wish you a nice day
Yeah back in the late 90ties going to Moravia, a mug of beer cost about an eighth of what it cost in Austria
Prague was a bit more expensive but still very affordable, and a great city to visit
Nowadays it has become very touristy and priced while still a tad bit cheaper have almost caught up
Well all prices except beer which is about half what it costs here
Yes, of course
And I do expect guests to take off their shoes too
Yes of course
I know in the Basque Country it's more common, but far from being the norm
I don't care if it's rude
My hardwood floor was expensive, you better not make scratches in it
Over here everybody is prepared to take their shoes off, it's seen as quite impolite to leave them on, so most people dress accordingly
And of course I offer guest slippers to everyone
And it always makes me feel icky, like I want to clean the floor after they've left
>What if their feet smell
I don't understand that argument at all - feet start smelling if they spend too much time in non-"breating" shoes, so you make your feet just smell more if you keep your shoes on
Especially when the feet heat up indoors
Rocks, pebbles, stiletto heels
Most of the classics that don’t use fancy meat cuts are basically „poor people food“.
So for Austria that would probably everything with Dumplings, Gröstel, some types of fish dishes, things with offal and so on
If I offer those dishes to my friends from the US or Asia they mostly are a bit skeptical but like it after a few bites
we call them "poor knights" here
You mean [Pofesen]
Arme Ritter are the half of Bovesen
The [mcdonald's on Schwarzenbergplatz in Vienna] is in a pretty fancy building
It used to be [way uglier] with big red signs and whatnot
I have one example that beats that
Although it's not fast food, but fast fashion, so *almost* the same
[The H&M on Graben is the fanciest H&M you'll ever see
] It's all marble and hardwood and Art Noveau
[However, the smaller one on Mariahilferstraße has a really fancy interior]
This is my favourite building in all of Austria and I live like 4 mins away
I doubt you can paint our buildings
At least I‘ve never seen/heard of anybody painting our building without just full on renovating them
And idk if you can legally paint them (idk the rules)
We usually just powerwash them
Maybe I missed it, but I found the first questions a little bit difficult to answer (was that the anxiety inventory
) because I wasn't exactly sure if it meant in general or at the moment
At the moment I am actually rather anxious, but about an upcoming exam, not COVID-19
I guess I answered the questions as intended though (little anxiety regarding COVID-19)
So maybe a control question about other life events would make sense there
I think trust in the government might also be a factor here, whether people believe the government is in control of the situation, so there is less need for personal control
Countries are handling this quite differently and I am sure this (and the extent to which each country is affected which can change in just a few days) makes a difference in the perceived anxiety
I am sure I would have answered this differently 3 days ago and I probably would answer differently 3 days from now, because the situation is changing so rapidly
Just be careful if you try to compare answers from different points in time
Good luck
There is not supposed to be a big difference
The questions are repetitive to make sure it does not depend too much on the phrasing and also to see if you are consistent with you answers (some don't actually answer the questionnaire they just pick the same answer over and over again)
Of course [I Am From Austria]
And I don't know if these count, because there's no text, but also [The Blue Danube] and [Radetzky March] for some reason
Hulabalu by Andreas Gablier ️
Nein
It was common in the past nowadays not so much
Wouldn't say very common, but not unheard of
Sadly, rabbit has gone out of fashion somewhat
Its something special, to be sure, but not unusual
Unsurprisingly our cuisine isn't very different in that regard
But i think with the spread of Asian cuisines throughout Europe eating ducks was normal everywhere
I have to say, they also make for a good Schnitzel
adding this for others: both types get eaten; bunnies raised by humans for their meat as well as hares as a type of game meat, the latter mostly as a festive dish in autumn
Do you have horse as a regular dish as well
We do eat it here but mostly in form of Leberkas
I was about to write Austria and Germany, but its really just Austria and Bavaria
I was shocked how much Carinthia reminded me of Austria
It's called Liechtenstein btw ;-)
It helps that a lot of Turkish people descend from assimilated Greeks of the region
Yes do this but please give back south tyrol first
Austria are slavic people with german language and germanic culture
Slovenia are slavic people with slavic language and germanic culture
Nah, they only hate it when you say they are similar to those damn Prussians
Yeah me too
I would argue that Vorarlberg ist closer to Switzerland and Baden-Württemberg, and the rest of Austria is closer to Bavaria, since Bavarians after all are only lowland Austrians
Northern Germany might just be more like the Netherlands
What the hell was the "und" supposed to be
If that was a "stand", how in the world did your autocorrect get to that
I'm baffled
The funny thing is that most prussians did never see much of austria except maybe vienna and so claim that we are almost the same
That many million people cities have a lot in common is completly ignored
Yes vienna is similar to some cities of germany but vienna isn't similar to the rest of austria
Its always the damn nationalists ruining the day for everyone
Yeah I think there we have the problem of definition
Greekness wasnt tied to genetics and one genetic group until very late
I was basing my comment on the more byzantine definition of greekness which also included the Anatolians and (oftentimes) the Armenians in the greater cultural sphere
They all were for all intents and purposes "greek" as that definition was mostly related to religion, language and looking to Constantinople culturally
Through this we also have many Turks being described as Greeks when they were in the service of the empire and spoke the language (the emperors "greek" general who accompanied the crusading forces during the First crusade for example is suspected to be of Turkish origins, which may explain why Tancred and the other crusaders hated him so much)
Modern day Greece on the other hand and the modern definition of greekness is mostly a result of the making of modern Greece after the revolution and the age of nationalism
It also didnt help that the unifying institutions of a "greek" empire had been increasingly shattered
So less of a genetic link to modern day greeks but more of the modern day Turks being descendentd of a population in a largely culturally "greek" (read culturally, religiously and also linguistically influenced) multiethnic empire
I dont know - I am from Southern Styria and feel no connection whatsoever to Bavaria
I can hardly understand them and the food seems weird to me
I think only the Bundesländer at the border can identify that much with Bavaria
Lets say it like this: if you look at culture a nation made out of austria, bavaria, czechia and maybe even slovenia would make more sense then germany
Germany is basicly made out of some states that all don't have much in comon
Areas like schleswig-holstein and thüringen have less in common then austria and switzerland
It depends from which part of Austria you are from
No but the culture of slovenia is way closer to austria and bavaria then to the other ex yugoslavic countries
Czechia is also cultural closer to austria then to most slavic nations,
Since czechia and slovenia were part of austria and even before that part of the hre and controlled by mostly german nobels for most of history they picked up a lot of germanic culture
Yeah you are right
I would also say that Tyrol (where I am from) is closer to Bavaria than Burgenland or Wien for example
Descendent from germanic tribes are people from north germany, the nederlands, north belgium, england, norway, sweden and denmark
South germany, austria and switzerland are mostly not descendents from germanic tribes but by slavic ones
Over time these areas just came into the hands of nations like east frankia which were majority germanic so the culture and language spread south
It basicly doesn't matter anymore since it is itrelevant after so many generation which tribes someone descent from but since austria loves to show how different they are from north germany we know little things like this
But we have way "better" differences we can show north germany to annoy them
No and no
Not really, from reading the title alone I could be super hyped
I definitely ain't though
Jo, wos zum teifl sogts eis iwa se
Also, it's not even true
In "other demographics" you can [see] that the number of more men to women is insignificant
A simple google search yields the total amount of men in millions to be 2
67 to 2
63 for women
It seems to me like OP has spent a bit too much time in the incel subs, especially as there doesn't need to be a woman for every man
There are also gay people, lesbians, people with no interest in romantic partners and, well, straight women that are *not* competing to get a girlfriend as soon as they enter Norway
If you speak both english and german I think all of the except Gold (Au), Quecksilber/Quicksilver (Hg), Blei/Lead (Pb), Zinn/Tin (Sn), Silber/Silver (Ag), Kupfer/Copper (Cu), Eisen/Iron (Fe) make complete sense
If you speak only German there are a few more like Wasserstoff/Hydrogen (H), Kohlenstoff/Carbon (C), Stickstoff/Nitrogen (N) and Sauerstoff/Oxygen (O) for example
I Always wonder which of the Sn and Zn is Zink and Zinn (tin)
It makes more sense in German than English
Sodium (Na) is "Natrium". Potassium (K) is "Kalium".
Then again, Nitrogen (N) is "Stickstoff" and Oxygen (O) is "Sauerstoff"...
I guess it evens out in the end
We got the rare earths down, but you got better gasses
Another thing that matches up: (K) *Potassium*, which is *Kalium* in German
(Hg) Mercury is *Quecksilber*, which is a cognate to mercury's older English name *quicksilver*.
Stoff isnt stuff
It can mean fabric, or material or even a substance
The best one is Nitrogen - Stickstoff -  suffocate substance
come to think about it, we do that for C (Kohle) if talking in an abbreviated manner about the components of chemical bonds and molecules sometimes
never for other elements though, for some like H it would get confusing (Wasser), for others like O (Sauer-) it's just not customary
and the official names always contain -stoff
yeah but we don't go around calling O2 Sauerzeug
see what they mean
extremely based germans, as usual
and in that case, that includes us
I don't know anyone who doesn't speak in dialect, people who speak standard german here get joked about
Arguably, for Austria the difference between language and dialect is very important
Dialects
Very
Very
Common, even though a lot of it is slowly being eroded by standard German words
Distinct languages we don't have any, but we have minority languages from the neighboring countries in border regions which we collectively tend to forget about very often
Sometimes those were even politicized as "foreign" (Slovenian in Carinthia - "Ortstafelstreit"), even though those ethnicities/language groups lived there since hundreds of years and even have a constitutional right to be treated just like German
Yeah just saying moin probably does it ;)
I have to give the croatian speaking minority in Burgenland a honourable mention since croatia is not a neighbouring country
As far as I know there is less of a political exploitation and Radio Burgenland even broadcasts partly in Croatian
Hey, already the second American in Austria here on askeurope, welcome :)
The thing is, Austrian dialect is not "official", so whenever you want to write something, you need to use Hochdeutsch
Dialects differ from Bundesland to Bundesland, and from village to village
So it's something you have to just try and pick up from talking to friends, unfortunately
If you do learn from an Austrian teacher, and your pronunciation becomes very good, chances are still that Germans will recognize that you learned it in Austria
The distinction is mainly political
There are different languages which are 99% intellegible and dialects of a language where you only understand 30-50%.
Even linguists dont agree, imo its up to you to decide :)
Another extremely interesting historical figure from Poland was witold pilecki
After the invasion in 1939, he went into auschwitz concentration camp voluntarily and organised uprising and resistance against the german occupation
He is the only recorded person to go into a concentration camp voluntarily and make it out alive
In 1946 he was hung by the Soviets for anti-soviet behaviour because he joined the polished partisans and fought against the soviet Union
Döner Kebab
Italien and Chinese Restaurants are common, even in pretty rural areas
Greek comes imho afterwards
Indian/Pakistani food is not that uncommon
American restaurants with steaks and hamburger can be found too
I mean, it makes sense that the German food is the most spread of all
The last sentence, no, a real Döner is with lamb/mutton and cabbage
Spitzen Liste
For all those without any clue (like me) here's the groups:
* Group A: Turkey, Italy, Wales, Switzerland
* Group B: Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Russia
* Group C: Netherlands, Ukraine, Austria, Play-off winner D (A)*
* Group D: England, Croatia, Play-off winner C, Czech Republic
* Group E: Spain, Sweden, Poland, Play-off winner B
* Group F: Play-off winner A (D)*, Portugal, France, Germany
I'd say we are pretty fucked
by far the easiest group so we're gonna be the champions
Pretty good, the Dutch are probably the weakest (or at least most beatable) team from pot 1, Ukraine isn't a great team either and the potential playoff teams should be manageable as well
We still have a shit manager though, so it probably won't matter
Aren't Netherlands really good
or am I confusing them with someone else
It's so fitting that of all the months in the year Gay Christmas is in May

ah, so maybe we got a chance you think
I‘ve heard many from Hufeisen-und (horseshoe-and), to litararisches und (and of literary) or kaufmännisches und (I think that‘s the german name for it: business/businessmans and)
I think most times it‘s just referred to as „und“ (and) or „et“ (and)
This weirdly looks like how our & came to be
[here‘s a picture of it‘s evolution on the german wikipedia site
] It oddly looks like half of the first stage, just a bit reversed
Does anyone have a solution to this
Peace in NI is based on the Good Friday Agreement, as far as I know
So now, that's out the window, because NI is either part of the UK or part of Ireland
What would cause less uproar if Brexit happened, in your opinion
Getting back together with Ireland or staying in the UK
People being constantly negative
Academic titles
You can practice something for an eternity but people will not accept it unless you went to an university and get yourself a fancy title
It does not even matter if it's the same subject
Same here
I hate it
I love how every actual Italian restaurant that is run by actual Italians in Vienna is always full of Italians, most of which are tourists
Like, try something new for once goddammit
And no offense, but personally, I don't like the average Italian's sense of fashion at all
I know many Italians feel superior because of their style, but it's just too *Italian*. It's too flashy and cocky
Sometimes I see a well dressed Italian, nice suit and everything, cool glasses, but then he wears like, neon-green gucci-shoes or shit like that

I've made the experience that Italians are even louder
The Spanish get louder than Italians only under the influence of alcohol
Then it gets crazy, especially when Andalucians are involved
They start singing and clapping and stuff
When abroad, Spanish people aren't as loud as Italians
By far
That has 2 reasons
Unlike Italians, the Spanish don't travel in huge groups
Naturally there's less need of speaking loudly
Most Spanish people try not to scream (especially in quiet countries like Austria), because the are afraid that someone might tell them something in English, and then they'd have to respond in English, and they are embarrassed of their English (this applies more to older people though)
Italians tend to give less of a fuck
The loudest fucking people are still drunk English lads though
correct

Honestly thanks for the Wikipedia hole I just fell into, my knowledge on medieval Austria was getting way too rusty
Originally taken from the Avars by Karl the Great, the *[Marcha orientalis] was part of the [Duchy of Bavaria] (itself part of the Frankish empire ruled by Carolingian and Merovingian dynasties, and later part of the HRE)
After having been recaptured from the Magyars in 955, it was ruled by a certain margrave Burkhard
Burkhard was part of a failed uprising against [Otto II] and deposed of in 976
That is when [Leopold I] became margrave, the first in a long line of Austrian rulers from the House of Babenberg
Advancing from the fortress at [Pöchlarn] he started resettling the east of his holdings along the Danube river and its [Wachau] valley, from the original Eastern border somewhere near St
Pölten further downstream up until Fischamend
He also had to secure his lands against internal dissension, and as such reduced the fortress of [Melk] that was still controlled by supporters of the old margrave Burkhard, and subsequently made it his new residence
One of his successors, [Leopold III] made **Klosterneuburg**, the older part of Neuburg (one of the dual cities of [Klosterneuburg] and Korneuburg that had developed by slowly evading the flood-prone plains along the Danube) one of his residences from 1108 onward
After rulers up to his father had resided in Klosterneuburg, [Henry II] (Heinrich Jasomirgott) finally made **Vienna** his residence in 1145/1155 (conflicting Wikipedia entries‽)
Henry II even became Duke of Bavaria for a short while after the Duchy was taken from [Henry the Proud] for not recognizing Conrad III, current King of the HRE
As such, Henry II moved his residence to [Regensburg] capital of the Duchy of Bavaria
After Bavaria was given back to Henry the Proud's line and was therefore taken away from the Babenbergs again, Austria was elevated to the Duchy of Austria as compensation in 1156
In 1192, Leopold V captured Richard Lionheart (of Robin Hood fame) while he was returning from the Crusades, and kept him hostage in [Dürnstein] in the Wachau region
The hefty ransom was used to build a coin mint and finance the first big extension of Vienna as capital
Having already enjoyed economic significance due to its position along the Danube, that intensified in 1221 when the city was given city privileges and [staple right] along with tax exemptions, making it an important commercial hub
In the 14th century, Vienna prospered due to clever policies of [Rudolf IV] (Rudolf the Founder), among them the founding of the University of Vienna (1365), who in doing so tried to compete against the local importance of Prague
Austria subsequently grew and dominated the area (and its capital with it), absorbing the Duchies of Styria and Carinthia that had been founded after the diminishing of the Duchy of Bavaria during emperor [Frederick Barbarossa's] reign in 1156, and ultimately became the [Archduchy of Austria] in 1453
It survived the [sieges of Vienna] by the Turks (1529, 1683) and even the capitulation against the [Hungarians] (1485)
**TL;DR:** If we take Marchia orientalis and Margraviate/Duchy/Archduchy/Empire of Austria as the continuous entity, the capitals were Regensburg, Melk, Klosterneuburg, Wien, Regensburg, Wien
Other important residences were in Steyr, Graz, Linz and Wiener Neustadt
Shifts happened mostly for administrative reasons and because of shifting spheres of influence, and the city gained importance before being made capital because of economic and geopolitical reasons (location, trade) and good economic policies (attracting commerce) as well as investments in infrastructure and research
It managed to stay important even throughout military conflicts due to fortifications, political support by surrounding areas, and sheer luck
Also, in medieval times it's sometimes hard to state what the "capital" of an area is when there's multiple residences with shifting importance, and no administration of the nation state in the modern sense yet
always found it interesting that the Russian capital is so far west, considering the enormous dimensions of Russia
thank you for doing so
this thread has rekindled my interest in late medieval European history
In Austria the most common thing to say would be:
"Das ist mir Wurscht
" / "That's sausage to me
"Das ist mir Powidl
" / "That's plum to me
"Geht mir am Arsch vorbei
" / "This goes past my ass
I had a teacher who would say "das tangiert mich nur peripher" (english: _"this touches me only peripherally"_)
Still my favourite expression of all time
In Austria you may alternatively say "Blunzn" instead of "Wurscht" (both things are used though)
Blunzn is slightly more intense than wurscht (both IRL, the taste, as well as metaphorically the degree of not caring)
Blunzn is a blood sausage, and also a pejorative expression for a stupid or annoying woman
> "Wat weis ick
Woos waß i.
I don't know why everyone (german) forgot "Egal/Mir egal". It is a word apparently only we use and it means I don't care
It's important to note that "Wurschtigkeit" is an Austrian philosophy
Like Alfred Dorfer once said: "The Chinese have Yin and Yang
But we Austrians are developed much further
We have Yin, Yang and Wurscht
Am Arsch, im Arsch oda ins Oarschloch eini
Ned mein Kaffee - not my coffee
Bad teacher then
Wurscht is one of the most used words in (southern) German for that reason
The word is also used in Spanish though
Egal = igual
Me da igual
Is ma blunzn
Sehr gängiger Ausdruck
That is entirely possible
A very very large part of our Austrian kitchen language comes from Bohemia
Because overproportionally many 19th century Czech immigrants worked as cooks
I say me importa un coño, estoy hasta el coño etc
all the time, but I'm a man
I learned most of my Spanish expressions from my girlfriend, so that's what inadvertently had to happen
Ich glaub du hast ein bisschen zu viel Curry auf deiner Wurst gehabt
If you ever learn Spanish as a woman, remember the word coño. It's very important
Golatschen, Palatschinken, Kukuruz, Murken, Kren, Marille (might be Croatian though), Datschi
I think it's Latin>Romanian>Hungarian/German/Czech
The placenta (the things that feeds the baby in utero) is called Plazenta (duh) or Mutterkuchen (literally mother's cake) in German
I've always thought that's such a weird term
Yes yes, that was my point
It's a direct translation because placenta apparently was a kind of cake in ancient Rome
I'm gonna open a beer on that
Prost *clink*
I heard that it was given up when the army realized that as a neutral country they could only use nuclear weapons as a defense on their own soil, and using a nuclear weapons in a small country like Switzerland might be a bad idea
Is that true, or a joke
Not really, they did it themselves
My sub of Skam literally only said to google it rather than trying to explain
Im not convinced

Stefan Zweig - The Royal Game
[The Wall] as it fits the setting ;)
His book "Nachrichten aus einem unbekannten Universum" was great too
It consists of all the scientific facts that didn't fit in "Der Schwarm", very well written too
Schlafes Bruder/Brother of Sleep - Robert Schneider
Well, the word already existed before and described the work/period that a serf had to work for his feudal lord (Corveé in English)
Historically it was used like that in German as well, as a loanword from Czech
But he gave the word the meaning it has today
Ah okay
In German it's just "robot"
Thanks for the clarification
It aint Democratic if it violates the spanish constitution
Why was Bosnia okay but the Crimea isnt

> When you have to jump through this many hoops to pretend you've won, it makes you wonder how strong the case for independence really is

Thing is, if it turns out that the Catalans want independece it would be pretty obvious that its you who is jumping through hoops
Am i right
Calling female kids or unmarried women "Fräulein" - a deminishing form of "Frau". For girls it's outdated bordering "old creep"-vibes, using it for grown women is insulting nowadays, because it carries the message that a woman isn't a full woman if she hasn't married
But still some people seem to be tought that this is the appropriate word to use
Funny you mentioned the word "seldom". We actually learned that in school and used it quite frequently in class but I've never heard it in real life
Fräulein, as direct translation from "Miss".
I still had to say it to the elementary school teacher, but nowadays it's only used ironycally (and/or degorative)
German has some grammatical tenses that students have to learn but are really useless
You can live in Austria or Germany for 10 years and never once come across Plusquamperfekt or Futur II
I'm also assuming students are trained to use the Genetiv case much more than natives, because in spoken German it's kind of dying out
That is the only thing I remember from French at school lol
Yeah, they actually taught us this at school
I've only heard it being used in old movies or series
I remember Jeannie in "I dream of Jeannie" use it once lol
my GF is from abroad and studies in Vienna
Whenever she writes a text, I have to correct her phrases with "das Bild von dem Künstler" and put them in genetive (i.e. "das Bild des Künsterls"; "des Künstlers Bild" is too hardcore, even for me)
Not using genetive in written academic German just sounds terrible and wrong
Language schools are not wrong to teach genetive
Even if the case is unnecessary strictly speaking (like so many other things in German), and it's slowly dying out in spoken language, it's still found heavily in written lanugage and it's still an integral part of German
How weird would people look if I just said извини, где библиотека? Would that be rude or something
My Russian is pretty limited
To adress a waiter "Fräulein" is oldfahioned but somewhat ok, if you use it by itself, but don't combine it with the name "Fräulein Mayer".
Our french teacher told us to pronounce it like "J'ai pas"
> I‘m quite sure that I use Plusquamperfekt almost every day
So does Heidi Klum
She OVERuses it actually
It's quite funny actually
Once you know it, you can't unhear it
Plusquamperfekt is a past tense form
There's Perfekt (I have gone), Präteritum (I went) and Plusquamperfekt (I had gone)
Futur II is for looking back from a future time
I will have gone
Both are rarely used in speech, although they occur in books
But when learning a language you want to avoid sounding like you're reading from a book
I probably do in English
Too many latinate words
Yes
Nothing wrong with teaching a bit of "Lokalkolorit" in my opinion, but basically I agree
Im Deutschunterricht, Hochdeutsch
crazy opinion, but I think they should teach *both*. imho it sucks how the everyday spoken language is always treated as an add-on, as something that "can't be studied, you have to experience it", bullshit
and missing study material is not an excuse, I want vocabulary lists for dialectal expressions and proper grammar sections dealing with the differences between standard and colloquial language
I think it's funny
A bit annoying, yes, but funny

How is a Mobile Device defined
Could companies like Apple get around some sort of restriction by dodging some incredibly specific definition
Like it matters at this point
The only one company that doesn't uses USB C for their new devices is Apple
Might as well call this law the Fuck-Apple Law
Not that I don't enjoy Apple getting some pushback for their shitty closed-off approach, but this still doesn't make this vote any less corrupt
But I thought the EU would hinder innovation by forcing everyone to use USB C? Have I been told lies by these paid shills and apple fanatics in all threads on this topic
What do they use
Because they are either paid advertisers/influencers/astroturfer/whatever they are called these days, or there's already 5% apple kool aid in their bloodstream and they don't want the EU to hurt their good friend Apple
Wow, ok

What an idiocy
Do cars drive themselves or are driven by people
> The problem is if the city is built with cars
A city built with no cars in mind would be a 3rd world village with no need for logistics, ambulances, garbage collection and fast transport to other places
European cities are pretty nice and sane in this regard
U.S. cities are not build specifically with cars in mind, but with large single-family homes in mind
>  It just that it takes arguably the best metro system in the world and spam of buses, vans, tramps, trolleys etc
I don't think you can repeat it in every city
The public transport system isn't sufficient
The more people live together, the more logistics and services needs they have
The plumber needs to park somewhere, so does the Amazon driver
Especially now that people shop online more and less in the neighbourhood, the need for space for logistics cars will increase
Here in the center of Vienna, during the day I already see more trucks, Ubers, Taxis, Amazon/UPS/other delivery cars than private cars and this trend will continue and increase traffic
Idk without the ads it kinda looks bleak and empty
Maybe I‘m just used to them
The whole debate about "straws" being banned is just so fucking dumb
Unless you're disabled you can easily just not use a straw at all
I really can't remember the last time that I used one
Maybe with a cocktail or something
But then again, just drink beer, so you won't need a straw
Plastic packaging of food items, or non-reusable cups (like in OPs picture) are a far bigger threat
And an even bigger threat are all the one-portion-packages that are being used by greedy companies like Nestlé, etc
in SE-Asia
They sell almost everything portion wise, e.g. Shampoo, coffee, coffee creamer, sugar, etc
etc
And these packings all end up in the oceans

The interior of the north tower is now on fire, [pictures from France 24]
This is unfortunate
I used a break of a few hours to visit Notre Dame on the way between train stations but had to cut that short as i had to catch the last train towards Scotland
Now at least parts of the Nave seem to be gone
The [photo on the frontpage of La Liberation] shows the Rosette window of the transept burnt through, so the interior, not only the roof seems to be burning
As the BBC had to quote some American on water and airplanes, I switched to the [livestream of France 24] which is actually understandable with moderate French skills
man this is a tragedy i hope they are able to rebuild it after this
Thank you for these clarifications
It's horrible what's happening
The silver is from me
The ceiling seems to be intact towards the towards - here is an image for [comparison] It's however difficult to guess if the spire fell through the ceiling but if this was the case, there would be flames coming from the windows of the Nave itself
You can see the rounded structure of the vault, that forms the ceiling, here is [a picture for comparisson
] If the interior was on fire, it would be visible through the windows at the side of the nave or the large rosette window of the transept
There was this very unfortunate episode where Daesh amassed hordes that pushed back the Syrian troops that had recaptured it and then went to complete the destruction of some of the historic sites

Welcome to the Club
Sebastian Kurz, the (ex- and- not- yet) Chancellor of Austria is 33 years old
Kurz is not currently Chancellor of Austria, [Brigitte Bierlein] is
Bella gerant alii, tu felix Austria nube
However, Kurz will most likely retake the position as chancellor before his 34
birthday
except if the coalition talks take a huge amount of time (his birthday is next august)
yeah, same with Germany
politically and organizationally it's the same thing, just a different name for the position; or rather, for some reason a specific English translation exists for the position
take ireland for example, the position of Taoiseach gets translated as "prime minister" even though the position is only comparable to that of a prime minister in Anglo countries (and nowadays, often doesn't get translated at all)
soy to summarize:
translation to the English term of prime minister is always only an approximation, actual responsibilities might differ depending on country
heads of state that don't have a presidential system (like US, France, since recently Turkey) could *all* be translated as "prime minister"
for some reason, countries with a Chancellor get their own translation
other countries' top leader positions seem to get translated less nowadays as well
Because its just a "temporary" government
They cant get laws through our parliament like a normal government can
Well, they voted for his party - chancellors in Austria are appointed, not voted upon
I never understood why the Turkish are so stubbornly denying the Armenian genocide
Just admit it ffs
I mean pretty much all of our grandparents and great grandparents were pretty much a bunch of assholes, commiting all kind of atrocities, especially during WW 1&2, and tbh it won't be a big loss for the world to see a generation raised by racism and overflowing nationalism gone
But their actions neither define me as a person, nor do they represent the modern day progressive country I live in
I will only be accountable for my own actions, not those of others
So if you're not a racist lunatic yourself, you shouldn't have much trouble accepting the evil deeds of people that are all long dead by now

Maybe it was just the feeling that a wonderful piece of our culture might have been lost
However hopefully we all will help together to rebuild it as beautiful as it once was

Oh, I'm not bothered
I'm rather questioning myself how much longer the UK strives to compete with the Trump administration in terms of who can manage to come up with the more laughable and embarrassing political disaster
And of course the people of the UK should be bothered, because their livelihood is at stake and their ruling government proves to be completely clueless as how to further proceed, but toodles, amirite
> Political disaster
Europe is now full of far-right nationalist populist parties with prominent positions and even governing
And surprisingly, none of them are even close to doing anything so incredibly disastrous that it has made worldwide headlines for several years at a time
When your government is doing such a terrible job that they even make fucking Matteo Salvini look like a competent person who knows what he's doing, something is seriously not going well
> and you think the UK having difficulties leaving an economic union as laughable and as embarrassing as Trump
Well, there's a reason why Trump and Brexit are by far the biggest laughing stocks in any relevant political comedy programme around the globe
It certainly isn't for their incredible success
> Austria in particular, c’mon, glass houses doesn’t even come close…
Considering that the elections are due in five days, that things are presumed to go back to business as usual pretty soon, that the moron causing the trouble in the first place has had his career squashed (instead of being elected Head of Government like Johnson was), and that the shitshow here isn't even close to taking as long or being as much of a global embarrassment as Brexit is (it is a pretty hard facepalm for the local population, I'll give you that one), I do think the comparison is quite a bit unfair
This is a clever way to say that democracy doesn't actually exist
I'd love to see a second vote just because I want to see how the pro-brexit guys wanna make people believe it is a good thing this time
Since most of the shit they told last time has already been proven wrong
I do genuinely hope for you fellow people in the UK that you get another chance to vote
Not because what I just said above but because of the distribution the vote showed
The old people said leave, the young prefered stay

Dude, Kosovo is recognized by almost every EU country and even if it isn't, it's certainly not ruled by Serbia in a way that would make the data applicable
No, she actually did choose the thug life, she wanted this job
Question: why not look for a planet b?
Yeah but it's going to be the only long term solution anyway
Why not push for space exploration
Yeah it's pretty obvious that speed alone won't get us far but the general public doesn't seem to care about it anyways
That would need to change
There are many ways we could still travel there in seconds
No of course not,  I mean we don't completely know what is possible and what not but wormholes and similar theories about changing space itself leave a lot of possible ways open

That’s just another one of those „My COVID-19 project“ bragging pictures
I’m from Vienna
When I was a child, we always kept  a shovel in the car from ~November - March to shovel out parking spaces due to the regular snowfall
So far, we had snow twice this year, maybe 1-2 cm and all gone the next day
This January, we only had below freezing during daylight hours for maybe 4 or 5 days
Just had lunch outside without a jacket since it’s 13 degrees
I’m only in my twenties, but even I can definitely feel in shift in climate over here, and it’s not just this year
The changes are getting more pronounced every year
Glad that there is no climate change
At all
*sarcasm off*
12°C in Vienna, it's absolutely insane
A few degrees less in the countryside where my mom lives - but usually, they'd be buried in snow there this time of the year
A few flakes around Christmas is all we got
This is fucking disgusting to me
I just want a few damn weeks of winter and snowy weather
I was in Edinburgh last week and it was snowing quite a lot even though I lived right next to the sea where it is apparently not so common to snow
Also, Edinburgh Castle was closed for a day because they deemed it unsafe because of the weather
Now I am back in Vienna and it is like 12 degrees
probably not global warming, probably

Last year, February was probably the coldest month in the winter season while January was very warm and this year we can drink our coffee outside
It is flabbergasting
Edit: spelling
This is the NEW normal
No, this will no change back during your lifetime
Whatever you do, it will likely not change it for the better - at most it will get worse more slowly
Yeah but we would all have to spend more money on air conditioning in summer so it's a stupid conspiracy
How many people really have air con installed in their flats and houses
(We bought a mobile unit last year)

Dude, in Austria, our Health Minister has called off a resolution that would have banned cigarette smoking inside bars and restaurants, citing "freedom of choosing". That same person is the Social Minister and said that 150 Euros a month is "well enough for a sustainable life". Sometimes reality is the best satire
Well, let them special snowflakes be special
Incredible caricature

What if you didn't go in the wrong direction but were too far away to reach France
This way also wouldn't annoy /u/thebarfly1
Austria numbah one
The big fight of our generation is starting
Right-wing parties really are the same everywhere
Exactly the same shit was rushed through the Austrian parliament recently, with the same arguments: "It enables people to work more hours if they want to, VOLUNTARILY
It took maybe 2 weeks before the first reports came of people being let go because they didn't VOLUNTEER to work 4 hours more per day
And it's always the parties that disguise themselves as the "party of the small man".
*surprised Pikachu face*
Exactly
Always be wary of the police, even though they are blue-collar ("What is a riot
A bayonet with a worker at both ends" -Lenin), they consider themselves an elevated class of society and have historically *always* been the defenders of the status quo, from the Roman Slave Empires to Nazi Germany to the Segregated South
They are not the friends of progress and they certainly aren't the friends of the downtrodden and destitute
Oh, thanks
Well, that’s kind of a problem, no
Policemen of the Weimar Republic swore an oath to uphold its values and constitution
Once the Nazis came to power, where were they
Already rounding up political opponents
Does he know that that's not a lady he's holding
Is he aware of it
The first blood moon I had in that game was the scariest shit ever
I went out of Kakariko and along a long stone path, and at the end of it I saw a Lynel, a monster I'd never seen before (At that point it basically just looked like a miniature Ganon)
It was walking around in the distance, so I thought it didn't see me
Suddenly, it had a question mark over its head
Then an exclamation mark
I swear, as soon as it spotted me, a blood moon happened and I had no fucking idea what was going on
I thought the Lynel somehow caused the blood moon
well it's called iceland, not snowland
Would not be different in any other country, including the US
From the russian point of view he tries to destabilize the government with fabricated stories about an assassination (honestly, that phonecall was too much
It was so obviously staged that it's even ridiculous that so many are believing it
Just as the Gas-Container-Stories in syria from bellingcat)
And i read in our newspaper sentences like: he was threatened with violence if he did not let himself get arrested
What do people expect
Police: you are arrested, please come with us
Person: no
Police: ok, if you don't want, you are free to go
Bye
(And yes, i know that I am collecting downvotes with my opinion, but I don't care - something is wrong here with the People's ability to question the narrative)

To be fair, the French eat Pepes, so not really a surprise
Austria, Netherlands, now France
all got away with an black eye
Only UK and US went full retard
Thank you france
A good day for the EU
Americans, you can stop pretending to speak French now
You have time until fall to learn German
Thank you France
So, let's recap
Hofer didn't win in Austria, Wilders party came second in the Netherlands, Le Pen lost in France
Next up: Germany where the two biggerst parties are led by Merkel and Schulz, a former President of the EU Parliament

Its funny
I thought my post is going to trigger t_d, instead its a bunch of salty Brexiteers
Cheer up guys, your side won and you've successfully fucked yourself with a cactus
Enjoy
I can get a flight from Vienna to Amsterdam and back for <100€. The whole thing takes ~6 hours if you account for getting to the airport, security, the actual flight, then getting out of the plane and going from the airport into the City
The train costs ~120€ one way and takes 12 hours just for the train ride
So unless I can get a train both ways for <50€ they are gonna have a hard time
Currently I don't travel by train because it's so expensive
One person driving from let's say Vienna to Venice costs more than 2 people flying there and back again and it's much longer
Just not worth it
Please fix czechias railway first
Thanks
Problem is, you would need consent of every member state the get rid of the VAT exemption for air travel and that is no very realistic
If you look at the graphs for European countries and the US, the difference is just extreme
In Europe, you have a slow rise to a frighteningly high number and then a sharp drop after measures were introduced
The US, at its lowest point during the last few months, was still at 2/3 of its peak
They just haven't fucking been able to get quarantine working
Now they've got a second wave ahead without even having beaten the first one
Buuut where is Austria D:
Hasn‘t improved since WOMDs and Guantanamo (looking at you Obama) for me
Oh no, I hope he is alright
> He won with a 73
3 turnout in 2016,
Do you believe he won previous ellections legitimately, or were the outcomes altered in his favour
Of course they do it is tradition
What are these fucking protests even about
Don't get me wrong, I like a good protests to put the fear of the people into politicians, but you got to at least know why
How many were chopped up while still alive
I recently learned at my University that you can see on the thickness of the guidlinebook (or whatever it is called,basically the book that tells journalists what they can do or else they get jail time) how free the press and freedom of speech in that country is
Look at Turkey it got bigger over the Erdogan years and look at my Country for example Austria it is a fairly slim book
lol no
We don’t like our dictator, nice try
But it's good, feel attacked, because on normal roads you should drive like a sane person
> but anyone still Pro-Brexit after three years of learning what a catastrophically bad situation this is for everyone is someone I'm not concerned about alienating
but in a way this whole process reaffirmed them in why they wanted to leave in the first place
I don't know how far parliamentary immunity reaches in Poland, but in some other countries they do
This is what really triggers me, the EU had this issue once, it was solved, next issue
The USA however shows its true colours with this
It's what, the fourth or fifth time now the King's of the USA are trying to murder NN, and they just keep trying until people grow tired of protesting
Any democracy that has any worth would have seen the massive protests the first time, and accepted that the people don't want this(for now anyway, I expect it to show up again on the EU agendas in a decade or so)
But the USA gov
Doesn't serve the people, and NN is a perfect example to demonstrate that
Also, I'm really sick and tired of being told to call my congressman
I did(I specifically voted for a party that said it would vote for net neutrality), we cemented NN(well somewhat, zero rate is still allowed) and just because the American Royalty won't accept it, I still have to see this shit everywhere on my internet, that is safe in a proper NN accepting union
End rant, stay safe Americans, and I hope you can power through this *attack on your freedom
Until Oettinger comes around

For people who are interested, here's the shortened, [actual hymn version] with English lyrics if you turn on annotations
There's also an interesting [alternative version with Latin lyrics] that I also like very much, it just sounds awesome (for a translation check out the video comment)
Last but not least, check out this nice [non-vocal flashmob version] that illustrates quite nicely on an emotional level why we can deem ourselves so happy to have something like the EU
You're totally correct, the Council of Ministers and any EU body representing the governments (like the Commission) is as shit/corrupt/lobby-influenced as the single country's governments
But that is especially why the EU has so much potential, because it is something greater that the single governments - take the European Parliament for example, time and time again it has shown that it's [voting with the best interest of the European people at heart] (unlike the commission, which is representing the EU's governments)
That is actually remarkable
I think it has to do with the way EMPs are sent there, and how they don't feel as much pressure to vote in line with their party/coalition as they would at home
Seems like independently voting MPs are really not so bad after all
Here's also a [great article about Margrethe Vestager] one of the good people in the Commission
She's a prime example of how the EU can be great if we send the right people there; freed from the pressures of national politics, they can actually work *for* the people they represent
It's kinda sad that this has to feel so surprising
but even more so I'm happy we have people like her and [Ansip] in the Commission
So very different from people like Oettinger and the Agriculture guy, I guess that's why shit like the Monsanto story still happen
[Here's something to feel wholesome to, we're all in this together <3]
On a more serious note, here's a nice article about [Margrethe Vestager] one of the EU's politicians that I think would just not be possible on a national level
Working *for* the people she represents, fuck, why does this have to feel so surprising
Here is a [version with English lyrics] if you turn on annotations
Or, just because I'm guessing you're speaking Italian, you might be interested in this [alternative version with latin lyrics] with the Italian down in the comment
Yes that's correct, sorry if I wasn't clear about that; it's an alternative version, a fan project if you will
Still sounds nice I think

OP, you phrased that as if it should be a joyous anniversary
You do realise that you are speaking about a Part of Roman MYTHOLOGY

A pillar stone of modern civilisation but quite the meanies
Can we now get back to something about Europe
I don't go to a European subreddit so I get informed about the god damn American election
He's not and people will soon find out
But they voted for him only to get rid of Trump, not for his own merits, so they won't feel responsible
For now, Americans don't like losers and Trump has lost
What's "wrong" in your opinion is that he is for due process and not this crazy "whatever the media say" thing
There's nothing crazy about the lawsuits
If the situation had the parties swapped with all the irregularities we've seen, you and all other bigots would be screaming about it
And politicians are just being polite
But to be honest, I don't really care how many ignorant people are cheering about the corrupt, unsafe near children and senile guy (whose VP basically called him a rapist a while ago) who has just been called projected president elect
The proof is in the pudding as they say, your comment and all the others will probably be readable still when the world realizes how Biden actually is
Oh, tell me more
What's indicative of the alternate reality
The Joe Biden everyone can see and hear on video, or the bubble deniers like you are living in
Do you need help finding those videos or are you happy to just believe it's all not true
So, your only argument is that you are ignorant and rude
Good job
Muslim from a european country here, this is bullshit
Edit: I just read that you meant the ones in the middle east, not in europe
Pardon me, I would have to agree on your statement
The fact that european muslims support terrorists
every single muslim I've met, and I've met about 50 or more, despises ISIS and other radical muslims
Not sure about your sources tho
Eidt: I've actually misread something, Pardon me
After meeting People in Egypt it is true that some hhave hidden sympathies for ISIS, unfortunately
I corrected my comment
Nah it's just that every single one of them is on this protest /s
ahhh, da old country
Americans tended to name cities after the places they came from, sometimes even entire countries
So maybe they thought that Italy, France was just as normal as Norway, Michigan

I love it
Love it when our system works
Next step: stop people from getting sued for memes
As an Austrian, I think it should be noted that Ms
Zechner wasn't chosen because shes's a woman but because she was closer to the SPÖ party
Franzmayr didn't get the job due to his ties to the FPÖ party
And of course doing a numerical rating of qualification on a quarter-percent scale is completely bonkers (i.e. this rating is an accurate measure of the candidate's aptitude for fitting in the rating system, which probably has some kind of correlation with the candidate's aptitude to do the job in question)
But if a ministry does use such an absurdly fine scale, it is obviously bound by it, duh
Really good comment
I hope more people see this
As you describe it people don't think these things through
It feels like an impulsive decision based on current politics about gender
I'd like to see them defend their position against other factors like height or attractiveness, because we know people treat others differently in regard to those attributes
We should just stop all road construction unless 50% of workers are female
Suddenly, many more well paid female workers
But in politics and media it's only about high paying white collar jobs
Or we have ~~slave labour~~ a conscription military, which only the men have to slave away in, nobody is asking for equality there, making this sex/gender irrelevant would be a landmark decision towards equality
It's just hypocrisy and sexism all the way down
I just wish we wouldn't import all this gender extremism from countries like the USA, and instead work for actual equality
Meh, nothing special here, same shit as everywhere

Austrian citizen since 1984
The final court decision was not only about the difference, but that the former minister insisted on hiring the woman over him because she wanted to have a female for the job
you can now also say that if a company hiring a male over a female they are more careful and never official say that the decision was because of the gender and not qualification
It would have been different if they would have used other arguments
The court just said now that preferring a less qualified person because of gender is discrimination no matter if the person is female or male
Hey, we got proper healthcare and low crime rates, don't chuck us into the same bucket like those crazies over the pond

The whole political process in the US is a clownery through and through
I don't want to make this point a "Europe good, US bad", but damn, the US system is horrible
So why is Austria almost always missing from these lists
You misspelled Austria
Poland and Hungary think the system works well
What a surprise
Also the complete lack of Congress and Senate term limits, almost completely unlimited freedom for social media providers to control public opinion and spread false information without repercussion, the fact that elected officials are sparsely to not at all held accountable for corruption and spreading lies and conspiracy theories
the list goes on
The reasoning for the US election system has been outdated for quite over a century
At this point there's no reason to still cling to the electoral college
States don't elect the president, people do
It doesn't matter where the people come from, as long as they're eligible to vote, their vote should count as much as everyone else's. The people of New York or California are not a monolith, just because they have bigger numbers doesn't mean they should handicapped in comparison to other states
How generous, you are allowed to take unpaid time off so you can try to figure out how to magically pay for your ridiculous medical bills
>Try being a software dev in Europe compared to the US
Now try being poor in the US compared to Europe
Sure, your "economy" might be better but at the expense of the people
If you are well-off the US may be "better" individually speaking
But if not, good luck
The US is a very individual-focused country and I don't think this is good for the majority of people in the big picture
But that's exactly what it does
Every vote should have the exact same value, because the people vote, not the state
The electoral college makes sure that they don't do, attributing different values based on the state
It shouldn't matter whether the winning 75 million votes came from one state, ten, or all of them, what matters is that that many people voted for a certain candidate

Fuck man you're asking alot from me
I'm gonna try to translate the last 5 posts from his instagram page
* the terror attacks are based on Islam (he's saying not all muslims are terrorist, but the people doing the terror attacks in europe are muslims)
* making a law against "political islam" (no fucking idea if that's a real word), basically making it illegal to be a radical islamist
* making a sort of list of radical imams (I think, could have understood that wrong)
* Keeping a big eye out on the people that where released after "not beeing" radical anymore
* taking the citizenship away from terrorists
* taking away their drivers licence
* the possibility to close mosques
* making some symbols illegal
I think that's all
If someone here speaks german they can try to translate it if they want

The funny thing is, there are a lot germans with let's say rather "right-of-center ideology" in parts of eastern germany
He did nazi that coming
EXTREMLY terrible
Innocent people getting punched by extremist terrorists
Should be met with a prison sentence, unbelievable
You can't go around punching people because they have other ideologies
That's even more nazi-like
It's not a political thing though
In Germany being a Nazi is outlawed, so punching someone doing a Hitler salute is not any different than punching a robber
We have a saying: "Fascism is no opinion but a crime"
>And I'd argue that doing a Nazi salute does not make you a Nazi
Only a fucking idiot if you're doing it in Germany
>The yank most likely thought it would be fun to do the Nazi Salute in Germany
If you're commiting a crime because you're an idiot you are still commiting a crime even if you don't know any better
>> so punching someone doing a Hitler salute is not any different than punching a robber
>I'd argue that there is a massive difference
A robber has the potential to harm you
An idiot doing a Nazi salute does not
Criminal is criminal
If the thing you believe in is outlawed then it just might be that you deserve some punches, the same as a robber or a thief deserves it
Most of the countries in Europe give much more to their state television annually, they just don't get bad press for it (instead they get bad press if they want to spend less on government propaganda)
The "instead of cancer treatment" is an interesting framing, as if they didn't have any other money
Very disingenuous
Watch more ARD, ZDF and you'll probably discover it isn't any different from what the Germans get these days
Inb4 it was the state that funded the attack because one lord one bought a drone and didn't have fun with it
When I look at America all I see are the black dots from this chart

I don't think the stereotypical European parliament has that many parties because some won't make it in countries that have thresholds
Austria - our thunbergistans are only going to be part of parliament again after the next vote
in america you got racist and less racist as options so
Well it can be really limiting in certain situations
Its like a chaos stability
You have Stalinists
What the fuck
Not really as populism actually means that the party is just using it to get voted and do not really believe it (like some left-wing parties are doing it to overcome right-wing dominance)
Calling those right-wing parties populist is kind of dangerous as people could get the feeling that they don't really mean it, which is not true
I like to imagine Paris being the eifeltower

TIL Arnie war auch ein Schwarzkappelzwerg
Austria is a nice looking country but the politics are just dogshit, corruption everywhere
I wanna leave Austria after my uni as well
Another reason for me to leave Austria is, I'm studying engineering and there are not many jobs (except I accept one with like 2-3k/month)
Even as an Austrian, his Styrian accent is quite amusing
The thing is, there isn't really such a thing as "Austrian accent" since the dialect vary so much in Austria
Arnie has a typical styrian dialect, which for example is totally differen from a tyrolean dialect
And of course totally different from the Vorarlberg dialect, but nobody in Austria except for themselves understand the people from Vorarlberg anyways
size-wise, yeah it's a village
but categories of distance and remoteness work differently here
I grew up in an Austrian village with 200 inhabitants and we'd call it going "into town" when we took the car to drive over three hills and past two villages to make it to the next one that even had a bakery and an ATM – but in this community we're still mostly university educated commuters working in the city, nothing bumhicksville-esque about it
but on the other hand, the "city" itself is only a town with 20k inhabitants and probably fulfills more characteristics of a US suburb than of let's say NYC
in short, things are hard to compare
>except I accept one with like 2-3k/month
What do you expect
You are fresh of the Uni, you know shit
Why should you earn more then a worker with decades of experience
Politics wasn't always that shitty/corrupt
It was on a very okay-ish level before Kurz got govermental responsibility
The politics in the 70s/80s were also very good for it's time, especially under chancellor Kreisky
I would never want to leave Austria without a good reason
We have high standards in medicine, social security and labour rights (way above EU minimum standards)
Also compared to other western european countries good wages and a high GDP (#5 in the EU)
Heast Oida
Bussi
Not the one you ask, but as an Austrian myself, I find that many people around here think quite fondly of Arnie
He rarely comes up on like the news or anything, and many people probably do think of him as more American than Austrian, but at the same time he is seen as a great example of being able to do whatever you want as long as you put yourself out there and are proactive
Yes
Austria isn't even particularly bad in that regard
(Rank 15 in the corruption perception index
Tho we might be in for a drop because the government is having a corruption scandal right now
Idk how correct that is but the starting salary is around 4-6k so why should I pass on money that would be dumb or
I'd also say that while politics could be better, they could also be much worse when looking at other countries
Kurz fucked up a lot
I not happy with our politics atm but I hope that it will be better when he leaves the government
That's true, I'm extremly happy about that we have such high standards, I dont hate Austria by any way, I love it but I'm not happy how things are at the moment, I can't really change it sadly but tbh I always wanted to leave Austria and explore new countries .
Yeah, but then you're in the US
with all pros and cons that entails
Around 50k in Austria
But the DACH System of workforce education is so completly different from the US (and many other countries) i have given up any comparison
I am pretty sure that a lot of the stuff that american engineers do is often done by normal worker (Facharbeiter) in Austria or germany
I mean most workplaces hold someone with a "Meister" title in higher regards then a fresh engineer and rightfully so in my opinion
Poor you
20 years and you ended up in the wrong (bigger, but worse) part of Austria
Wish you all the best still
Yeah, get used to that
We dont like germans

> The Austrian conservative party ÖVP said that they’re going to reject it a week ago, and now voted in favor
As I expected
Always expect the ÖVP to vote against the best interest of the common worker/employee
How is this in _any way_ sursprising
I wouldn't really call NEOS neoliberal
Sure, that might be fringe part of former ÖVP members, but neither Strolz nor Meinl-Reisinger are excessively right-wing, economically speaking
Is that why they oppose the 12 hour day

What most people care about however is the children they selfishly brought into this world, and them not having to subsist in some kind climate war hellscape
And that's the angle they should be communicating from - save your *kids*, and by extention the planet

[Thank god they didn't go with this design]
Didn't the ECB try to tell us that we should get rid of 500 EUR notes because only mobsters use them anyway
There are higher value banknotes within reach of the EU (e.g. 1000 CHF), also due to inflation it will need to get reintroduced anyways within a few decades
Felt it easily in the area of Graz, Austria
Whoof, some of these look like a WW2 scene
Fuck, that looks terrible
Let's hope the casualties don't go up

this *always* comes up; yet in reality, Burma uses its own system, and Liberia just doesn't have a nationally defined standard (yet has strong economic ties to imperial-using countries, therefore that system is often used, among others)
Other countries "use" metric but are stuck somewhere in conversion limbo
this *always* comes up; yet in reality, Burma uses its own system, and Liberia just doesn't have a nationally defined standard (yet has strong economic ties to imperial-using countries, therefore that system is often used, among others)
on the other hand, many other countries "use" metric but are stuck somewhere in conversion limbo
Do you have a source for that
A couple of days ago I read that top is Japan with 13 ICU beds per *1000 residents, my country (Austria) is in the middle with 7 beds per *1000 residents and the US ranges quite low with 2
8 beds per *1000 residents
Edit: numbers were per 1000 residents, not per capita
Edit: So, I figured why the numbers were so different from another
Apparantly what I read considered all hospital beds, not ICU beds
I think it was necessary because most people don’t instantly think of the US when you talk about countries with poor infrastructure and health care
I read your link and it really doesn't look good for the USA if you consider that you spend more than double the amount on healthcare than most other countires
it’s more the inaccessibility of health care that’s made fun of, not necessarily the quality
and as europeans i don’t think we can quite imagine how bad it is, because we are so used to accessible high quality health care
I know you guys are very patriotic and you definitely have good health care specialists and all that, but the health care infrastructure can’t be compared to europe
i spent 16 days in the ICU with a life threatening situation, got a ride in the ambulance, got a shit ton of meds, 2 MRIs, 2 cat scans and an angiography during that time
guess what, it was for free
then there are americans i met through my self help group concerning my disease that couldn’t even afford to call an ambulance (despite working 2 jobs AND having insurance
) as they were suffering from an active brain haemorrhage that could’ve killed them
is that good health care infrastructure in your eyes
Please, the US looks at Europe like we’re a lost cause and shows 0 respect
Saying that the USA are an example of worse health care is just the truth
It would be worse if Norway wasn’t making it clear and lots of their students end up surviving COVID 19 in the USA just to come back with crippling debt
we’re far from that clowns level, the statement seems tactful enough in my eyes considering the situation
but that’s just my opinion
Entertainment Propaganda works
USSR should have invested into movies
Sovjets suffered the most but it led to more suffering afterwards
There are some very dark stories about the soviet occupied regions in austria very oppose to the other regions under us uk or french reign

No, it definitely would have been different

LEBERKAS
:-D
best in the world
I really have to make a Leberkäs-wednesday again (getting a few kilograms of different sorts for lunch, being spinach-garlic (alternative: ramson) my personal favourite, presenting them at the office and watch the co-workers dive into it like hungry lions on a fat gazelle)
Yea, it's a Meme-abomination stemming from r/Austria
The marmalade is still in there, but they probably added mustard and pickles to it
who knows
I'm an Austrian and the popularity of this meme is beyond me
Probably it's because i'm far older than the average Austrian redditor and as such see combining massive amounts of sugar, fat and meat of questionable source more as a major health risk than a good idea to put in your mouth

Dude, why are so pessimistic
First of all, money doesn't automatically equal a (harmful) use of ressources
If I buy a bottle of wine for 60 instead of 5 Euros, it's the same ressources that go into making it
Second of all, what swiss people are doing happens, happened and will always happen all over the world - just on different levels
Striving for more
But that doesn't mean, humans are shitty / terrible
It's our nature
Why is it soo hard for many to accept this
If we don't turn this passion into environmental protection on a lot of levels, we're screwed
Not only in 3rd world countries, but globally
But this is probably where I and you differ in our expectations
I truly believe that mankind will manage the turnaround
A lot of grass will be burned,a lot of suffering
But this is inevitable
And it always has, throughout all stages of history, even before humans emerged
We're in the transition phase of adapting to a self inflicted rapid change of our environment
If we can't adapt and/or fix it, we will be like dinosaurs, but there's one big difference: We have the means to do sth
about it, and humans will
There is just not enough panic yet
Ok - there is the unchangeable difference in how we believe the world works: I truly believe that disparities are necessary for the world to work
You think it's a glitch in the system, that should be overcome
From my pov, if we delete disparities, the world would stop existing after a few hundred years
I'm a true believer in evolution - biological, social and economical
And yes, I am very well aware of how unfair this is, and that both of us live on the upper side of things
(Aka our privilege)
1st) I have 2 masters, 1 in economics and the other one in communications (that's the lesser one
) - it's probably hard for you to understand how I could possibly have the opinion I have
Actually maybe this helps: I grew up around left-wing politics my whole life (my parents are both politicians) so I know this game inside-out and I am very well aware of the weaknesses of classic left policies (as well as classic right policies)
2nd) I don't consider myself extreme in any kind of way
Actually pretty centristic
I am absolutely pro social-state politics and helping people in need
But, and this is a big but: We (as a country / group of central european countries) have already reached the sweet spot
It doesn't get any better
There are details here and there, that need to be fixed, absolutely
But the general level of redistributing whealth is just about right
If you think this is a right wing position (that I don't want more redistribution) then please open a history book and compare actual numbers, laws, etc
Today vs
the decades before

In english you say "are xx (years old)" instead of "have xx years".
so where do the cars go now

Nope

There is no need to paint Putin as anything, he is bad enough
Moscow is a place I want to visit and don‘t want to visit at the same time
So, following this logic:
I can do 200km/h, have a cigarette break / time out instead of getting a speeding ticket and then continue to do 200
Nice
that's why I think we need different measures: section control, temporary impounding of offending vehicle for repeat offenders

And then there is Austria with their red representing the heathens they slaughtered in the name of god
Deus Vult, I guess
Same in German "Weißrussland"
But Austria still had the idea first and having 2 flags that similar will just confuse everybody

Except for Vienna
Sadly its raining at my place :(
While in Vienna, no signs of snow
And Here in lower austria we got nothing ;(
Its totally fine, we once had more snow almost 20 years ago, and i loved digging tunnels as a kid
Vienna can't complain
Bitch, where
I haven't seen snow in a year
Just like in Vienna
Just take it to eastern austria, we are dry too
Luckily, maybe
We had plenty of snow a few days ago, getting more would be difficult to manage
It's only great if you go skiing
The snowpack probably not entirely sedimentary snow, but of aeolian origin
But yeah, the past week was pretty sick snow wise
Although, if you presume you've got five overweighted individuals sat in there (500kg), plus something heavy in the trunk, it's not off by orders of magnitude

Very moderate, nowadays that's already a win
They started a poll, people except Germans didn't care to participate
Yes, the demographics were lopsided, but the result was quite clear
And the Commission only introduces bills
It's still up to the Parliament and the Council to ratify its suggestion
Presumably, if only Germany wants this, it'll never come to fruition

There have always been political differences between the US and Europe; under Obama, Bush, Clinton,... But until Trump, the trustworthiness and reliability was never really in question
If stability was ever considered important the US wouldn't try to destabilize Russia on every occasion

Putin likes to kill with low dose Polonium 210
There basically is not a dose that that is non-lethal (1/1000 of a gram, invisible to the human eye

Crazy how important German tourists are for many economies
Some of our Ski Resorts announced tgat it is not worth opening this year if germans are not allowed to come
Then again, I kind of understand that
Prizes for skiing skyeocketed, many locals dont want to spend that much so you are bound to tourists willing to spend that much because its their holiday
That's a crow

I've spent about a week or so reading through frugal opinions here, trying to figure out if they might know a thing or two I didn't but I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that it's just indignant talk you can hear at your local pub
the fuck do you expect your economy to grow without massive public spending
Exactly
We should have all laid back and watch our economies go down the drain
once their debt reaches a critical level they'll have to default but honestly, this concept of repaying debts is so 1920's.
Frugals really are confident idiots
He's been on my TV screen way too little
It was planned to reintroduce face mask requirements on Sunday, but either Kurz is against it or, worse, he just wants to be at the press conference personally announcing it
that's not how fiscal policy works
Public spending always works as an imprest
>he just wants to be at the press conference personally announcing it
Search your feelings, you know it to be true
He desperately wants to be the strong and stable leader during crisis, so crisis gets to go on until it fits into his schedule
Doubt he's against it after the lockdown and previous facemask requirements
At most some industries will get exceptions but i have my doubts even there
that depends on how much money you collect in the end
No economy ever rebuilt itself from austerity
can't stop the bleeding with an arrow in your stomach
how dumb do you think I am, austerity is the wrong tool to deploy in a crisis
You were taking austerity as a metaphor to stop the bleeding, i.e. stop the indebtedness and the lowering of creditworthiness, at least that's what I got from it which is why I pointed to the fact that it's useless if you don't even get the opportunity to rebuild the economy in the first place
Hmmm
maybe people don't like seeing their countriemen get blown to bits or decapitated

Get some Belgian towels instead and swap them with them
See if they recognise the difference
Or as an Austrian I would just use one of these chairs and when they complain, I would tell them, that even though we don´t want a reunion with Germany anymore I appreciate their thought of reserving a place for us Austrians too
Seeing this you'd think they're good at invading
You know it's your obligation to throw all these towels on a big pile, then watch them fight each other to their deaths
Throw it in the pool
I don´t think anyone would care about that disrespect
It´s not like in the US where they make such a fuss about the flag
Quite the opposite actually
Reveering the flag like Americans do would be considered creepy
just burn it and replace it with austrian towels to assemble doninace
But it's a rule that basically gives you the power to ignore others, so it's fine
now I'm wondering about the required thickness of cloth that makes a flag not a flag, or makes a towel a flag instead
I don´t think hardly any German (unless he is extremely patriotic which is rather rare) would even bat an eye if you tossed an actual flag into the pool
Of course it is suprising but we will accept your surrender and start to integrate you into our Austrian empire

The most mind-boggling thing is that so many pro-Brexiteers were, and *still are* of the opinion that the UK has an advantageous negotiating position
Honestly, props to Boris Johnson & Entourage
Such a level of brainwashing has rarely been reached
The best thing was when they compared EU exports *to* the UK and EU imports *from* the UK using absolute figures - completely forgetting that the EU is 27 countries and the UK one
You have *got* to be shitting me
The EU's immense bureaucracy has so far managed to be way more effective at communicating clear divorce guidelines than May's coalition of disaster
44% of UK exports, God damn it
Imagine half of all exports suddenly becoming subject to high import tariffs
We're talking about a recession of Great Depression proportions
And again, the EU is the larger bloc
Mayne it's slightly slower at negotiating than the UK, but still from a more powerful standpoint, since it makes up pretty much half of the developed world
See as an African-Australian that seems so odd
30 degrees celsius is like what, 86 farenheit
That's a good day here in Rio
It was a solid 105 degrees F/ 41 degrees Celsius for an entire week this month

We also use "It's a spanish village to me" (like the balkans)
Maybe it's just me but the railway thing sounds very much like Germany
At least in Austria we are also saying "those are bohemian villages to me".
"Das sind für mich böhmische Dörfer"
but German speakers *do* have a language-related idiom (Spanish, just like the Balkans and Hungary) - we just happen to also have the railway station one
We also have "Am I talking Chinese or something
" when we feel like we've sufficiently expressed ourselves and are still not understood
At least in Austria we use both
I only understand railway station and
It seems spanish to me
Not sure if Germany is the same
Why is the Chinese character for Love (愛) on Russia
Smells like propaganda
Seriously why *is* it there
It's oddly fitting and completely out of place at the same time
Germans and Austrians use spanish too
Stop fucking putting Austria and Switzerland into the same "pot" as Germany
Germans have their own ugly stupid language and the example given is a prime example on why its stupid
Nobody in Austria would say that
If you said that, people would laugh at you and call you stupid german
Interestingly, we also have Kauderwelsch in German
I always thought of it as a north German expression
Didn't know it came from a Swiss city
Although the spelling of Volapük is not correct on the map, ‘volapyk’ is definitely wrong in English

It just doesnt work
Exactly my thoughts
Here is the video I stole this from without a license:
Yeah, but you don't give up on democracy in your country because some politicians voted for a shit law
You vote for politicians who will best represent your interests
Only if any of them have content filters according to EU guidelines
Much more likely is them just blocking any european IPs
It is way too expensive for sites like Imgur to either manually or automatically review every single one of their uploads for any copyright infringements
Yeah, you can criticize democracy all you want, but I'd be interested in the alternatives
Because the EU parliament is democratically elected
Yeah, of course, is that too complicated for you
Who voted this bill into law -> European Parliament
Who did we vote for -> European Parliament
"Europe broke, how could this pass, so bad hurrdurr" is in essence calling this democratic system broken
It seems you've somewhere along the way missed the connection between my first comment and the following chain of comments
You can criticize politicians for their decisions, you can't criticize the whole of the EU for decisions of a number of democratically elected politicians without also attacking the whole process by which they were chosen

Strange
When I am in my car or on foot, most people on bicycles seem like idiots, running red lights, speeding in pedestrian areas, driving over pedestrian crossings
Hawara
Everyone is shitty
There's a link from a week or so ago over on /r/fahrrad quoting a study in, I believe Germany, that over 95% of all citizens asked (pedestrians, cyclists and motorists) said they regularly break the law
Just today as I was going out on a ride, I almost got hit by a car cutting me off during a turn into a bike lane as I was leaving the regular road
This week I did a bunch of cycling in the center of Vienna and counted several cars, bikes and pedestrians not following various rules (almost hit a ped because of their flagrant disregard for the rules)
Everyone is bad
The police need to enforce lights on bikes at night (almost hit a few bikes while on my own bike because of this)
The police need to be better about enforcing speeding of cars
Pedestrians need to be especially aware of their surroundings when using paths marked for both them and bikes
> Everyone is bad
The thing is, the idiot traffic planners today make things worse because instead of working to prevent conflicts, they actively encourage them with their measures
Many bike lane crossings with streets are very difficult to look far enough into to prevent accidents with fast-riding cyclists, for example
Or painting bike lanes next to parking spots, or on already very narrow streets, is just asking for trouble
You have to remember that there are also lots of places in Europe that are simply very old and trying to bolt another generation of infrastructure onto something that is already a few hundred years old isn't very easy
That is not an excuse for doing stupid things
Take away: we're equally stupid, we just need longer to start the stupid
I guess its time to flatten the curve again

No, its --4-20
It surely has downsides, but on the other hand I think it's also nice because you can get out of the city and have a lot of nature
Germany is pretty densely populated everywhere and there are hardy any vast nature reserves, that's pretty bad too imo
Do you have to pay for those
you never heard about the netherlands didn't you

Russia wants to weaken the EU to strengthen Russia, while China wants a weak everybody-but-China
Sure, but I don't think they have the need to mess with us on that level
The Copyright Bullshit in the EU Parliament is certainly US Fuckery
Dude, if that Copyright reform goes through I'm also against the EU, but on the other hand I know enough history to know that next to the USA, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and China it's really important to have some close friends, or we'll all learn Chinese, or Russian characters in our schools by the end of the next decade

I just want someone to look at me the way trump looks at putin

I visited Helsinki this summer and expected to see this
Not even once I was able to experience this traditional finish culture
Maybe everybody felt like they were in the sauna due to the heatwave
Actually everybody I talked to was very helpfull, especially the readhead bus driver who usually works on line 14 or 39
Without him I would have never got my lost phone back
Besides that
at the old market I was pushed, yes, PUSHED by locals who wanted to get on one of the tourist boats
I recon that summer wasnt normal for Finland, was it
PS: the berries they sell at the market there, are they really handpicked in Lapland

The new Austrian health minister on his way to his swearing-in
Why does shit like this get 11K upvotes
In Vienna a lot of them do it
Especially of the Green Party
[this is our president last summer]
> Sneakers
Oh the tabloids are allready making fun for him for that
Den neuen Gesundheitsminister als "shit" bezeichnet
Anzeige ist raus
Health problems, was close to a burn out and he and his family got numerous death threats
Probably not that experienced in wearing suits and has to look absolute perfect in a few minutes
Just a wild guess if I had to wear his shoes
It's more likely the stress and strain of the job that might do him in
That's what happened to the last one at least
Thats not how that works
It’s common even for high ranking politicians to use public transport in Austria
Resigned because of health reasons (burn out) and because he received numerous death threats
In Austria they really aren't rare
For example, this sub has seen Van der Bellen countless times in public transport
The green party has its fair share of hypocrites too, it's  pleasantly surprising I'd say
He's been seen in the U1 (subway line) too
He's a medical doctor, so most likely vaccinated by now
Also the smear infection risk was grossly overstated in the beginning of the pandemic
to not touch the handles, even without a pandemic raging I rather not touch the handles if I can avoid it
I know how often you have to refill the soap in the men's room, and it's not nearly frequent enough for every 3rd person to use soap in there
Because of the Covid restrictions he implemented
They were necessary of course, but not everyone agreed on that matter
Some idiots disagreed even more and threatened him
A minister is not directly elected by the people, so he doesn't care for votes
At least thats how it is in Austria
No they are not
And don’t say that I’m gullible to believe that
It happens in many countries that way
Yes, but if I was that concerned (and not vaccinated), I would rather ride my bike there than taking the tram
If you view it like that yes you are right
I didnt think about that
This is the most idiotic thing I have ever seen a country do
How much did it cost to do this
How about we pay health-workers the amount they deserve for the hard work they are doing
Idiots

Can we also talk about how the EU budget is not a black hole
You pay into a budget that also has things in it FOR YOU
The 215bn were not lost
A huge precentage of it came back into the UK as science-, agriculture- and infrastructure funding
Sure you dont get everything back as a net contributor, but lets stop pretending that every single euro (or pound) paid into the EU is lost
Its just plain wrong
/rant
The UK really should just form sort of economic union with Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
The UK never belonged in the EU, and that is fine, but BJ also should not force the UK into some deal with the US
Bad idea
Strong relations with the Commonwealth Realms are much more important
The US will want to screw the UK over and destroy the NHS through privatisation

We could have been gloriously a mix of nuclear and renewables but alas by a tiny margin the country went the wrong way and banned nuclear :(
Austria for the win
And yet we're getting flak by the EU for not "reducing" our carbon footprint fast enough
I can see all the French and demi-French smiling in nuclear (Sweden and Slovakia too)
Fun fact: Austria actually got a nuclear power plant
But it was never used for enetgy production
The goverment allowed to build it, THEN they made a referendum if the people actually want nuclear power, people said no
As far as I know it is now used for training purposes
This makes me weirdly proud and happy
Look at that, Austria is actually leading a positive statistic
Nice
I am not satisfied at all with how things are going
We had a huge head start with hydro and don't produce enough of wind and PV energy
Sehr stolz grad
Yeah, but we don't want to feel bad about ourselves so there is that
Those two don't really cancel each other out
But isnt that a bad excuse
You only need hydro-power etc for peaks (daily and year over) and in order to get a nice average, but for the base load you can use renewables
&#x200B;
The Netherlands have access to the ocean for offshore wind power and they could use biomass too
Also you say that the Netherlands are not connected to Scandinavias grid
Why not
They could use their hydro dams then to help out
What I noticed in the UK as Austrian is that the UK seems to lack in the whole grain bread department
In Austria (and Germany) you can get tons of very good whole grain bread, in the UK there's hardly any, you see some mixed bread, but it's mostly white bread (which doesn't taste that good, except for bagels)
They do, but much less than Austrian shops
Yeah, but with reduced calories you will have to think about nutrition at some point sooner than later
If you eat food with low nutritional value but you eat a lot of it, chances are you will still sort of get enough of what your body needs
But if you eat less and still keep up the same low-nutrition food, you are going to run into trouble at some point
Not that Burgers and Pizza are inherently bad, but there's a huge difference between a Burger stuffed full of veggies on top of the meat, or bacon
American pizza is a calorie bomb with all that fat dripping off and the fat bread
Yeah, I saw after I replied
But that wasn't the implication in your original post and I dare say that was on purpose to make it sound cooler ;)
True, I like Italian pizza most, which isn't that hard to get with the amount of true italian restaurants in Austria

They do their job as passive reflectors, but they'll never be a substitute for an actual transceiver on the 457kHz rescue frequency
Those are more common amongst possible civilian first responders (or at least I never saw any private person actually carrying a Recco detector around)
That could, if you're lucky, buy yourself time for survival if you find yourself buried
Since the reflectors work differently, having both on you can definitely help, especially if you consider the recco a fallback plan (should you forget to turn to "send", should its electronics fail, should you lose it due to some reason)
But a transceiver is a must
As you said, renting it is a good option

Just wondering, because there might be a misconception in Eastern Austria
I am sure there are more cities, either way
I also think this map is incomplete without adding the names

I thought the Romans never invaded them
Is this just modern cities
Because I know the Romans founded at least Vienna (Vindobona) and the way larger abandoned city of Carnuntum in modern lower Austria

In fact, your "wealth" increases the moment the share increases in value
Buy low, sell high
Right

How can you secure them against people breaking in with such huge windows and what looks like thin walls
Not break but get passt the locking mechanism which usually is weaker than the one of doors, and it is not like those doors look like they are steel plated
You can't really but bars or exterior metal blinds on those windows

I remember from an exam in constitutional EU law that the administrative apparatus of the whole EU is roughly the size of that of Munich
It's a bit missleading because a city needs to manage many more things like waste disposal, energy, housing, etc
but overall the administration of the EU is rather sleek
&#x200B;
Much of the missconceptions about the EU came from UKIP propaganda which was mostly just factually wrong and Nigel Farage apparently was on a russian payroll
Definitely, but UKIP specifically had ads about EU legizlation that was made up
There was an ad about a hotel room with labels on everything, saying stuff like "EU has regulations on pillow size" and "EU has limited the number of threads in the linens" and "EU limits the number of curtains"... etc
and that was a lie
Every country had rules about the quality of cucumbers before that, the EU just unified those rules to be the same for the whole EU, making it easier and more efficient to trade
Also no cucumbers are "prohibited". They are just categorized in Class 1, 2 3
Every country agreed to the ruling and could have prevented the legislation with a single vote in the council back then

Hey
This is not the US
> he should be able to express the view while others should be able to comment on that view
Saying historical documents are falisified and thus extinction events have not happend is not a view you can comment on
It's moving the goalposts by taking a view and crossing out all evidence that doesn't support it
This is what most of the time happens i you "debate" a genocide denier

History is not as set in stone as you would think it to be
History gets rewritten all the friggin time
The only defense is to keep the people from trying it
> Would you mind to give an example
If someone claims that historical documents (that have been researched and found to be authentic) are forged, you can not meaningfully comment on that other than to point out that they are not forged
But since the perception of your opposite is already that they **are**, you can certainly comment, but all comments will fall on deaf ears
> Why would we take this chance away by deleting and banning people with certain views
Because the typical genocide denier does not care about discussion
They care about instilling doubt in historical evidence
All they ever do is call into question established facts
How would you discuss chemtrails with someone who believes airplanes are used to disperse psychoactive substances over the broad population
You can't reason with that
The very nature of the fact that you even discuss with them is evidence for them that you are either unwittingly or willingly part of a greater plot against them
**This is the MO
Giving these people room to express their views takes up time, space and resources that could go against something productive as well as actually ligitimizes their concerns about the evidence presented
Nothing about discussing with these people is worthwhile
There is a remedy
Exposure and education
If they have to touch the doors to the gas chambers
If they have to talk to actual victims
But you just can't reason them out of their mania
> Any truth should stand any discussion or opposition

My parents are from Romania and they always tell me this too
I basically grew up with stories about how negligent and irresponsible people there are
Unfortunately, that made me always see Romania in a negative light and I feel like I'm kind of biased in that sense, which I'm still trying to overcome
But whenever I mention anything interesting/nice I learned about Romania, I always get a string of "yeah but this and this and that and look what they did and wow what a shithole run down country that is" from my parents
I always wonder how much of what they say is true and how much of it is bias, so I find it interesting to see that you seem to have a similar impression as they do
Hope you're never getting sick
Thanks for sharing that
It's funny that you mention that Romanians complain a lot about their country though, because I usually hear the opposite
Both from my own experiences and from what my parents say
I guess most Romanians I've spoken to are also immigrants though, so that would make sense to take pride in one's origins in that case, but the same can't be said for my parents and people they've spoken to
They always told me people are very nationalistic, so I just assumed that to be true

We had school-done skiing weeks
FPÖVP killed them in an impotent attempt to save a few cents, and long term damage the local tourism with it because teenagers didn't learn skiing anymore through school, which meant they had a chance to learn it if their parents didn't care

I was in school at that time and still to this day have friends that can't ski because they never went with school

Absolutely nobody is arguing that Mozart was born in the Archduchy of Austria
I mean, its very nice of you all to explain my Culture and History to me but its getting a bit tiring
Yes, Salzburg was not an Austrian Coreland but always was deeply connected to House Habsburg
Salzburg is now a Part of Austria and an important Part of the Austrian Identity
Also, the Archduchy of Austria is not the modern Nation of Austria its Part of the Austrian Past and Heritage
You did imply it
He was born in Salzburg and had his Center of Life in Vienna
he lived his Life in the Austrian Corelands, that Area that goes on to Form the Nation of Austria
He is very much Part of the Austrian Heritage
Why is it important to you to proof that he isnt Austrian
Which is so weird, because tourism is big business, and this shifted the whole thing more towards foreign skiiers, but now that is drying up and the reckoning is coming, the whole winter tourism industry is completely in the gutter, it's filthy expensive, it's already quickly 1000€+ for a single person for a week, imagine a family of four, nobody wants to work for them anymore, and they're already getting special work allowances to be able to get people from Ukraine or even further east because not even eastern EU wants to subject themselves to these working conditions
It's just a first class clusterfuck 20 years in the making

The fact that they are banning people that have been to Crimea is ridiculous

Same goes for the modern, flat glassbuildings
I live in Vienna and i don't feel like everything repeats itself
Maybe because most were build from private investors so there was a natural will to differ you building from the other
Interesting topic, but i know too less about it
But people often forget that modern architecture doesn't have to be repetitive
After all, it's mostly free of normes or symetry, so you really could build anything you want and let your creativity roam
But most of the times money has to speak a word
There is simply not that much money for great architecture available, at least from the government - there are all for cheap housing (which is important too)

Correct
It's important to remember that turkey does in fact not own northern Cyprus, even if they like to act like they do
TL;DR: Turkey invaded, claiming to protect a Turkish minority, and then just kept their troops there in violation of international law
Historically Cyprus used to be a British colony
However, most people weren't happy about that as they shared lots of culture and language with either the Greeks or the Turks
Under British rule both population groups received individual administration and were, willingly or not, separated
This let to them slowly drifting apart, even though relations had before been pretty close and peaceful
Then, in 1923 the greek-turkish war happend and the relationship between these groups got even worse
Starting in 1930 the Greeks began small revolts against the British who were still holding on to the island, however they were mostly unsuccessful
After the second world war Greece began supporting Greek independence groups on the island and turkey did the same with Turkish groups only shortly after
The British managed to put those two groups against each other and it escalated into a civil war that nearly dragged Greece and Turkey into another war
After lots of negotiation it was decided to release the island into an independent state
Back then Greece, turkey and the UK all agreed to do their best to ensure that Cyprus remained an independent country and was not annexed or integrated by any of the other nations
The new constitution attempted to give both the Turks and Greeks equal rights, f.e. by giving the Turkish minority a veto power
However, nobody was truly happy
The Greeks had wanted to rejoin Greece and the Turkish had wanted to split the island into Greece and Turkey
This let to the two parties constantly vetoing each other and nothing getting done
After bloody riots and small scale skirmishes between militias the UN send peacekeeping forces that more or less separated the island between the Greek and Turkish population
Then in 1974 Greek militia tried to overthrow the government and join Greece
Turkey intervened and landed troops on the island
Nobody wanted a full-blown war, so the rebels decided to hand back control to the previously overthrow government
However, the Turkish government refused to withdraw troops
So today the UN troops station in Cyprus in practice just make sure that the Turkish military doesn't cross into Cyprus in an attempt to somewhat keep the peace on the island
While the south of the island has remained a democracy and has joined the EU the north is de-facto a regime
It has not been recognised internationally and turkey has repeatedly been ordered to leave by the UN

Author explanation of that map:
>Europe has repeatedly been broken down into major regions where physical/geographical and often national and political criteria and considerations have figured prominently including human geography
This will be an attempt to develop a faithful model of cultural spaces excluding national and political intentions while applying factors that (1) leave perceptible effects in the cultural landscape, (2) have a co-determining effect on the attitudes and behaviour of people, (3) are critical factors for today's social, political and economic situations, and (4) provide a spatial breakdown that don't change rapidly
The concept of Central Europe is the point of departure because it has been under discussion for a long period of time and has flared up again on the debate on the end of global and political antagonisms with a particular impact on Europe
Eight criteria will be applied for narrowing down this concept in spatial terms: (1) The historical impact left by German and Jewish culture (as specific characteristics) in addition to Slavic, Romanic and Hungarian layers of culture among other (that are also in evidence outside of Central Europe) (2) The coincidence or temporal succession of Protestantism and Catholicism while orthodoxy and Islam play only a minor role
(3) The early development of an urban system and middle class in comparison to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe as a counterweight to nobility, gentry and church (4) The early existence of a free class of peasants who were not subordinate to a lord of the manor (5) A tradition of local and regional self-administra tion as a result of early political particularism (6) Cultural (i.e., linguistic and religious) diversity including ethnic diversity within states (7) Always tending towards the continent in political and economic terms (not overseas) (8) Late industrialisation in comparison to Western Europe, but early industrialisation in comparison to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe This allows the conclusion that these territories can be subsumed under the term of South-Eastern Europe because they are under Byzantine influence, although the long Ottoman domination has also left sustainable traces
In contrast, Ea stern Europe means the portion of orthodox Europe under Byzantine influence that was only marginally impacted by the Ottoman Empire and hardly transformed by it
Furthermore, Northern Europe is the part of Europe that has remained totally Protestant with a low development density
Western Europe is subsumed under the concept of former colonial powers and territories that are orientated towards the Atlantic and sustainably impacted by the Reformation with an early urban structure and early beginnings of industrialisation
Finally, Southern Europe is the Catholic and essentially Romanic countries with a major seafaring tradition
The regional concepts defined according to these criteria are shown on maps that is supplemented by structuring

Always weird to see this kind of map

Do you guys normaly get much snow down there
I would say we are doing fine
Corona could be better and we had some embarrassing (goverment) IT projects lately
Snow is as every year, some parts dont get snow some are drowning in it
Which is impressiv considering our size
Where I live there was like a centimeter snow that was gone after the day and the rest of the days it feels like spring
And other parts of Austria are fighting with the snow
So a year like the last few it feels like, although the contrast is more apparent to me this year
Because of corona or in general
Yes same in Vienna
But it's normally like that
Usually on the second or third wave sticks
I guess its because the ground is still a little too warm
OK fair enough
But I didnt even know that you guys get much snow at all to be honest
I personaly would prefer some more heavy measures to be honest
I feel like out measure are a litle bit to easy going and since today they are even more
I fear a christmas/new year with a big spike incoming
Do be so obessed bro
It's only snow, not covid
Confirmed cases are not infections
Graphs like this are useless without knowing whether testing has increased at the same pace as confirmed cases or not
An explanation of what these figures mean:
>What you see slowing down is the second derivative, i.e. the rate of increase of the rate of increase (for example, day-over-day: +500, +510, + 509, +508 etc
) So the US is still far away from an improvement
It's also not clear whether the figures are accurate, as the US has not been administering as many tests as other countries
What Italy having "turned the tide" here means is that its rate of growth is decreasing (i.e. day-over-day +500, +495, +490 etc
I think this chart should properly show the US somewhere 5 pages above everyone else instead of making the jump from 50 - 100k show in a single line

Good old Zensursula
It's really weird to see that von der Leyen is an actual human being
I'm in
We did our part for sanity: France you're next
Van der Bellen is clearly the better choice
In order to explain, i copy a previous comment of mine:
Hofer (the right wing candidate) is by far the most disgusting person on the political stage
Never before has a campaign been operating with that kind of maliciousness, that Hofer and his supporters have shown
They had less arguments for themselfes than rumors about their opponent
At first, they started spreading rumors about VdB suffering from Chancer and Dementia
In the later phase of the campaign, they started calling VdB a nazi, a communist, a spy of the eastern block (while always claiming that Hofer had better relations to Russia) and a neoliberal
This right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out
In an earlier debate, he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in Jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of Israel
The TV station found out, that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack Hofer claimed to have witnessed
He and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate
It later became known that while Hofer was at the temple mountain, someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police, but this was not identical to Hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns
He was not near that, but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack
A few weeks ago, he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses
When beeing called out for that, he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim
Telling lies with a straight face is what Hofers campaign is based on
Hofer tried to make himself look sympathetic, but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling "lies" when VdB started citing him
There is a real danger that should he get into office, he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view
If he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate, he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness, taking Austria as a hostage with him
The really dangerous thing about Hofer is, that he is working against the EU membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to Russia and Serbia
Both of these countries are economically unimportant to Austria
Hofer would cause economical damage by trying to severe relations to countries that are the most important to us while bowing down before a country that offers no perspective for us except how things looked 50 years ago
After Brexit and Trump, it's nice to see even a small victory over populism
And I'm very glad this country has at least some common sense left
In theory it's still open, this is just the first projection at about 60% of votes counted, without postal ballots
However it is very unlikely that anything is still going to change
Last time around the first projection showed Hofer ahead and VdB still came out the winner in the end
The current results are mainly from rural areas
Urban areas tend to be more left
hooray
today im glad to be austrian :D
Oh, wie ist das schön!
I'm surprised to find reddit to be rather left wing oriented according to this topic

Ehhh
It's not so much about overall turnout but about voter mobilisation
And it looks like Van der Bellen was better at this
[People were prepared]
FPÖ said that they won't contest the election, so the glue's OK
Austrian solutions to Austrian problems :>
Especially because he is usually doing better with postal votes
And this result is without them
It doesn't count if you only do it once, it's a best of 3
He did win with a much greater lead this time around though, so that's reassuring :)
You are welcome
I think many people were pissed off that they had to vote for a 3rd time becasue the FPÖ appealed it
This is my personal theory on this
I think it shows that people are trying to maybe get more involved in political process since they can grasp that real change (represented by the FPÖ) can happen
This motivates their own voters as well as everyone who wants to prevent it
Thanks for getting occupied and taking one for the team
I still have a tab open, one of their last posts was: "Remember the President is just a figure head and doesn't have any real power
What matters is the Chancellor which the FPO party needs to win in 2018 which they're leading by almost 10 points
It won't be close as today but be ready for that
" by user ZodiacT10 (ZodiacT90 is the founder of the_hofer, maybe a sock puppet or just an alt-right meme name
i can already tell you how that will go
övp and fpö will have about the same % and will form the next government
god help us
Actually more people voted this time
That's incredible
Center-left won over far right, so good
Nein
Das waren nur wir
Gott hat damit nichts zu tun
Just reducing it to immigration is a little simplistic I think; also van der Bellen is not really pro-immigration while Hofer is definitely anti
Hofer: Right-wing, presents himself as anti-establishment, plans an active presidency (and unconventionally so), talks about change in broad bold strokes, definitely anti-immigration
Made inquiries about chemtrails in parliament
van der Bellen: Left-wing, environmentalist, plans a more traditional moderate presidency, wants reform but with level-headedness and calm discussion
Says he wants to be a president of all Austrians
Might motivate both sides more to take part in elections (increasing voter turnout) - the ones that are pro-populist right wingers to "prevent another disaster" and the progressive ones (or anti-populist right wingers) "since there still is hope out there".
My hope is that this leads to a better climate in total, with right wingers realizing that just making outlandish claims and spweing hate is not enough to win elections without some actual program behind (Hofer was actually quite good in this regard most of the time) and the rest of the bunch being a bit more motivated and actually approaching their base again a bit more openly
Nothing will change
Even if the eurosceptics would win in some nations
There is no Eu exit movement besides the one in the UK
And other than in the UK most nations require a super majority in both referendums and the parliament to leave the EU
This is impossible for eurosceptic parties to achieve as for example our moderate parties and the dutch moderate parties refuse to go into a coalition with their respective far right
We'll carry on
I wouldnt say that, thats way to generalized
Basically, to become president of Austria you have to get 50% + 1 vote
In the first round there were 6 candidates:
* Alexander Van der Bellen, former leader of the Green Party, running as an independent
* Norbert Hofer, from the right wing FPÖ
* Irmgard Griss, former judge, running as an independent
* Rudolf Hundstorfer, from the social democratic SPÖ
* Andreas Khol, from the conservatice ÖVP
* Richard Lugner, TV-personality and millionaire who was running as independent
Because none of them had more than 50% there was a second round with the winner and the second place of the first election
This was then ruled as not valid and had to be held again and then also the date was changed because the postal votes were flawed
This means, that a lot of conservative voters or voters from the social-democratic party voted for either candidate because there was no candidate of their own party
Austrian parliament is at the moment split between 6 parties with 3 major ones (SPO, OVP, FPO) and 3 smaller ones (Grüne, Team Stronach, Neos)
I think if was less amazing then people thing VDB was well liked across the left spectrum and also within large parts of the liberal conservative voters
He was the best candidate for a extremely polarizing election
And I doubt that the Green Party would find a similar candidate soon again
If you look at it like that it was an extreme feat but not unexpected
We have a whopping 6 parties in our parliament now
Especially if you consider that we're only 7 million people
It's one of the few feats I think is genuinelly good about us
...by a margin of 6%, no less
*sigh*
Austria has never really been in favour of Turkey joining the EU
Polls in 2006 showed, that as much as 81% of Austrians disagreed with Turkey joining the EU
That figure is probably even higher today
Obviously, after Erdogan imprisoned critical journalists and said that he was thinking about reinstating the death penalty there was no way that Austria would suddenly support Turkey joining the EU
What shall he do
? He has almost 0 executive power
Learn about our political system before you say something - please
There are only the mail votes to count tomorrow and they won't be able to change the result
Hofer already admitted defeat
For a change, we do the Anschluss the other way around now ;)
THey did say that last time though
No, this result includes a projection of postal votes
In real numbers he's about 100
000 votes ahead at the urns
9 million votes for Hofer vs 2
0 million for VdB
Are your coalition parties capable of working together
Because here in Austria they are essentially like a disfunctional marriage and one of the two (ÖVP) has been eyeing the FPÖ as their new boytoy for the past year or so
(They also had 7 years of coalition from 2000-2007
Hofer is far-right, but not a Neo-nazi
3rd
Did I miss one election
Kickl is even worse TBH
Repeating an election because of faulty envelopes is not enough
That was some overplayed media bullshit
Sure he can
he could even give his party an order to form a gov
And then what
The power in the national council remains unchanged, leading to the most impotent gov in the 2nd republic
Next election the FPÖ might even vanish under the limit nessecary to get into the parliament
The only votes in there would be constant votes of non confidence against the new FPÖ govs members
And if hed also dissolve the council
Then a new general election would be held, and imagine how THAT would turn out for the FPÖ if they pull that shit
No real fringe views, he's a very moderate left
Then what do you call a party that uses election posters with solgans like "Daham statt Islam" which translates to "(At) home instead of Islam"
or "Heimatliebe ansatt Marokkaner-diebe" - "Love for your country insted of maroccan thiefs"
A party with tens of covicted politicians - a lot of them because of sedition or "Wiederbetätigung" which stands for "re-engagement in national socialist activities" - alone in the last 5 years
What do you call them if not racists and bigots
Every since "polarisation" has become a thing
My side: Everything good on this lovely green earth
The other side: Everything bad in this fucked up world
Between: Doesn't exist
Open discussion of ideas: Go fuck yourself you [opposite side label here] bigot
I have never met a left-wing racist
Not all right-wing people are racists, but all racists are right-wing

Austrians just don't like frivolous elections
Any party that provokes reelections gets soundly blown out on the day of decision
To be honest, I don't think many people care about Trump
Brexit was imho the bigger factor
No, it did not
They just had a different result which included the projection of postal votes
One guy said that in 1991 in a heated debate
A guy that's dead for over a decade
Deshalb rennt er mit ner Kornblume herum :\^)
Na, aber in meiner Denke is die 2 ausgefallen, und nicht einfach verschoben worden
I voted 4 times, because postal vote
I was about the send out my ballot for October 4th when they postponed it
> Kickl is even worse TBH
Kickl studies philosophy since 50 semesters and just doesn't get smarter
But he's the playwright, not on the stage (mostly)
And what a poet he is
BIERZELT STATT SHAKESPEARE
Idiocy knows no borders, also there is a difference between sharing values and exercising them
What's globalist about it anyways
thanks for also caring :)
As you can see, I posted this 6 hours ago when the national broadcaster said that 1% more people turned out to vote this time round
I'm sorry for not having accurate data right after the polls were closed
If they didn't fly to Austia to vote in person, their vote isn't even counted yet - postal ballots must stay closed and uncounted until tomorrow
Because zero tolerance policies are not popular or realistic at all
Right now the FPÖ seems to be more nebulously claiming that there are "too many" (without giving any indication how many would be fine) and that they are "dangerous" (again: no actual measurables given)
Hofer wanted to be seen as more likeable, taking a harsh stance wouldn't have helped him
6 yrs
no, half of the country are not environmentalist
but then again there are also nazis who recycle ;)
I know
Look at the image
It clearly says "Hochrechnung inklusive Wahlkarten-Prognose".
In theory, everything
Full control over military (hah, funny, as if we had one) and the government
However, the president is expected to never use those powers except for emergency situations
In practice, the position is just for representation and a advisor/mediator for the day to day government
However, Hofer has announced he'd use those powers
And he certainly could have helped his party in the next elections
Aja stimmt, hab ich voll verdrängt
However, the ORF included the postal votes in their projection
We have a larger spectrum, our conservative, center right wing party is the ÖVP which I guess is more in line with your believes
The FPÖ (party of Hofer) has focused on one subject the last couple of decades and that's problems with foreigners and immigration
A lot of their members have ties to far right organisations, for example one organisation Hofer is or was part of doesn't recognize Austria as a country and sees it as part of Germany
Aside from that they may hold some solid conservative views, but it is behind a very questionable shield, which is very very hard to overlook
It also doesn't help that we still have to deal with shit from the time they were part of the administration in the early 2000s.
It's not just a guy it's a party, but what would you call Le Pen for example
Yes maybe not all right wing politicians are like this, but in the last years we see a rise of these politicians and their supporters
No, not here
Let me introduce to the accepting world of *[Burschenschaften
>A frequent accusation is that Burschenschaften have an elite social understanding
In various publications, during events and demonstrations, the traditions of the Burschenschaften and other groups are often put into a right-wing context by their opponents
In particular, the Burschenschaften of the Burschenschaftlichen Gemeinschaft are politically often at the right edge of the student connections
Basically, a collective of elite students, often sons of lawyers and entrepreneurs, who get together and exchange mostly right-wing, nationalist ideas
It's a little hard to explain
What's not hard to explain is that every politician from the party Andreas Hofer is in is either a current or former member of a Burschenschaft
Hofer is in one of those groups and proud of it
Sounds like he'd make a good, neutral president, right
Since it's South-German it is very close to Austria and reports on us more frequently than others as far as I am aware and it is also widely respected (iirc it was the newspaper that was initially approached with the data from the Panama leak)
I'm stupid, sry
If you would get called a Nazi all the time you would just out of spite just as everybody would
After being called a Nazi over and over again Haider said "well at least he had some proper economic policies (unlike the current government at the time)". It's a quip
Kanns dir nicht verdenken \^^
I am not surprised about that and I am also not satisfied with the slow and insufficient reaction from our politicians regarding the refugee crysis
That doesn't change the fact, that a lot of the right wing parties have no agenda except - let's leave the eu and close the borders and even for this one point they have no plan
Brexit showed us how that works out
So why shouldn't we be allowed to call ultra nationalists racist
See you also think you are clever by quipping but you're falling into the same trap he did
That's exactly what I'm talking about
It hasn't happened because the pro Brexit side doesn't have a plan
It's the same with our right wing party
A lot of talk but no actual plan and that is different from caring about your country, because caring would mean to have at least a rough idea about every political matter instead of some slogans regarding foreigners
That's not what I said but nothing you have said sofar would lead me to belive that you are a guy for nuances anyway
Well than we have something we can agree on, I am also pro Brexit because I think it's better for the EU

but so many issues coming together in such a massive outbreak, feels like somebody has been pouring gasoline on the little flames to turn it into a huge firestorm

Finally a time to plug my subreddit /r/flagsinreallife
Used to work as a receptionist at a hotel
Something that needs the be said especially about people from France is: They speak english pretty well but only once the tried to speak french to you for like 10 minutes, not believing that neither you nor any of you colleagues (which was usually 2
) speaks french
Like, literally, they stood there talking to me with words that I had no idea what they meant
After 5-10 minutes they SUDDENLY remember how to speak english
Sorry by the way that I just plainly said "people from France" I know its just a minority but stating that in the sentence above would have overdone it
As a little "repayment" I also think that people from France where among the most friendly, topped only by Japanese and Swiss
This kind of speaking is giving me a circleruntogetherbreak

Would that do anything

Because there were significantly more people (illegally) demonstrating against the covid-lockdown in a 2mio city (Vienna, or basically every major city in Europe) than there were demonstrating for Navalny in a 12 mio city

The problem is actually not the fact that they want to be no EU member
The problem is _leaving_ the EU
It'd be comparable with Texas wanting to secede from the USA, the legal, regulatory and economic systems have become so intertwined that leaving is a big mess of trying to recreate all that legislature
**But wait
** We haven't even gotten to this
The UK is now arguing, how deeply integrated into the EU they want to be
There is Norway which is deeply integrated but not an official member, then there is Switzerland which is less but still heavily part of some institutions
And then there is basically Brazil with no ties at all
This is what the UK is arguing about
Also, there is a whole border conflict with Ireland, because Northern Ireland (part of the UK) only remained peaceful, because there was no border between it and "real" Ireland because of the EU
This would now create a border again, which around 50% of Northern Irelanders are going to be _really_ mad about
It's not just random people on the internet jumping on the "paid by Soros" thing - it's actual politicians as well

Do they wait for 5:45 h before shooting back
Austrian here - short update 10:40
- 5 dead people so far -  one terrorist, four pedestrian now (09:25)
- ~12 injured (all gunshot wounds), 7 of them in a pretty critical state
- the dead terrorist was 20 years old, born in north macedonia and did have the austrian and macedonia citizenship
Back in April 2019 he was arrested because he did try to join IS
He was released on 5th December
(10:40)
- the dead terrorist did wear an explosiv belt, bomb squad had to come and take care of the body
He did have a rifle, a pistol, a machete and lots of ammunition
~~Atm (02:10) they analyse if the explosive belt was real or just a fake~~ 07:10 it turned out the explosive belt was a "fake" and would not have worked
- the dead terrorist has been identified, ~15 house searchings happend 2 or 3h ago, few more people arrested during this house searchings
(09:25)
- police and special forces are searching the city atm and arrested 4 more (but atm its not confirmed if they are involved or not)
- Jagdkommando (military special forces) taking over the protection of special buildings (like embassys) from police, so police can focus on the search for other terrorists
- its still not confirmed if the nearby Synagogue was the target or not
The whole area does have a lot of bars, theaters and other stuff and this evening / night was the last one before the new Covid Lockdown starts today
Interior Minister is just being interviewed and he confirmed it is a terror attack with multiple attackers and multiple people dead already
Operation is still ongoing and all the special forces are being activated
The Austrian Jagdkommando has been deployed in Vienna, followed by "good hunt

God damn that shit hits different when you see those videos of places you’ve been hundreds of times
A second civilian has apparently died
A woman succumbed to her injuries
I missed one of the attacks by a few minutes, it was right on the usual path from my garage to my apartment
Police closed the bridge to the 1st district as I was going in that direction
I waited 5:30 hours to get home (with police escort
) and have to say: they're very well organized, extremely friendly and helpful
It feels very safe despite the situation since they're well-equipped and secured every sector of the area
The current government however, is a bunch of incompetent losers
One Thing that has really become apparent is how different our news sources are
On one hand you got our state news "ORF" wich Reports on facts and confirmed statements
And on the other you got the shitshow "Ö24" wich plays all the videos that are being posted against explizit Orders from police on loop, even the graphic ones, uncensored
At least one police officer was confirmed dead, currenty 15 people in hospital, 7 of them severely injured
Source: Vienna hospital official statement and reports from our most important TV channel
Edit: the police officer was hopefully wrongly confirmed
Latest reports say one dead attacker, on dead civilist
Vianna hospitals report "several dead and severly injured"
Edit 2: reports still only confirm only 2 dead (1 attacker, 1 civilian)
Chancellor Kurz just confirmed that the police officer is not dead but severely injured

The first terror attack we in Vienna experienced for 40 years
I hope nothing else happens, thank god rumours about hostages and a detonation were fake

Interestingly enough, Synagogues have 24 h police protection in Austria

It doesn't take much to do these kinds of attacks
Sadly true, Vienna's mayor just confirmed it on national TV

Last updated speak of 7 deceased, there are multiple videos online
A shame, used to rely and pride itself with neutrality :(
6 shootings, we don't know yet if those happend at the same time by 6 or more attackers or one after another
and we don't know what weapons they have, we only know that the attacker shot by the police carried explosives
And the live-ticker the newspaper Der Standard: [
Only speculation right now, also they are posting videos despite the explicit plead by the police not to
Still unclear
They said 6 locations
1 killed, 4 maybe arrested and 1 on the run
Would make sense, but could be only 2 attackers as well
It were probably humans
This won't end until we stop letting them in and deport every single asshole that shows even the slightest sympathy for attacks like this
I hope they keep lists of those cheering on social media, whatsapp and so on
Enough is enough
this is not local news but the boulevard showing stuff the police has asked not to show
stopp posting stuff like OE24
Absolutely agree
Funnily enough I know the founder of OE24
He seems like a nice man
But his news channel is trash
Judging from the footage it didn't look good for him but it hasn't been disclosed who the victims are
Won't ever happen here
Too many people against this
Atleast one attacker is confirmed dead
One perpetrator is supposed to be dead, one arrested
Might be the same person, everything is pretty much in limbo right now
police only confirmed "long guns" until now without any more details
It's not
Might be flash-add-"walled" but you can just click that away - or use an addblocker
The change since 2015 is tangible, people are slowly waking up
Me neither, Vienna is supposed to be one of the safest cities in Europe, this was the first terror attack we had in over 40 years
Let's hope it stays that way and that the last attackers get caught
I have faith in our anti-terror-unit
Vienna is still one of the safest citys
if you are better to judge those things or have more information than the police, you might should tell them (the austrian police asked to not upload videos here to help them [
otherwise those are just rumours what people might have seen or heard and not knows facts
hm strange, I never noticed a paywall

I would honestly like to know how many Power Plants are close to complete failure
Judging by the complete incompetence of some EU countries, I fear what their reactors look like and how they are maintained
Yes it's clean energy, but we do not live in a competent enough world to utilize it
I can agree with that
Still think building new ones is not the way to go
Austrian here, hes name is Alexander Van der Bellen and he is boss of the fraction who is green and they dont use cars

Good riddance
A friend of mine recently came back from being in the States for 5 months and basically what he told me is that going to church is something which he enjoyed much more there than here in Austria
There he learned a lot, it was fun and he always looked forward to meeting people there
Here it's something boring, you don't learn a lot of stuff which you wouldn't learn in religion in school and it's something old people do
Here the church is something old and many even hate it
Disclaimer: I can't accurately say how the church is here out of first hand, only from what I've heard from many others
> Why does it seem like many in this sub will attack anyone for being religious like its a terrible thing
I see very little personal attacks against religious people on this sub
Attacking someone's religion isn't equivalent to attacking someone's persona
If you equate the two then you're wearing into dangerous territory of shielding religion from critisism and outside opinion
> I know plenty of very nice, intelligent, non-delusional religious people here in the States (yea, I know, it kinda sucks)
That being said I also know many nut-jobs from both deeply religious and atheist backgrounds
Now you're complaining about people's hatred for religion itself
What is it you don't understand
Dislike for religion or dislike for believers
And yes
Obviously a nut-job is a nut-job no matter whether he's religious or not
That's not exactly something people are denying
> Why can't atheist just let the Christians be and vice-versa
That's what everyone is doing
Voicing your distain for somebody's belief itself doesn't impede their ability to stay religious
Nobody here's physically forcing people to lay down their belief
> Why does one have to dance on other people's faith for being fairy tale and the other lambaste someone for not believing in their God
Criticizing faith is allowed
It's what we call free speech
And in this particular case it's more than understandable
Would you take issue with someone dancing over Greek Gods and their Mythology and calling them fairy tales
> Particularly why does this sub think that a complete lack of belief is the best thing ever and many (not all) commentators shame religion
Why do religious people think they're right
Why do atheists think they are
The answer to both questions is obvious
Both groups think of themselves as the moral high-ground
Nothing annoys me more than people getting into heated discussions about pizza toppings
Pizza is Pizza, I welcome it in any form that it may come, and if you don't, you are a whiny nuisance
If you don't like the topping on your pizza remove it, but please dear god, shut the fuck up about it
Why the hell is Austria the only country on that map which is empty
Yes, we do speak German but we certainly aren't Germans
Btw
: We say Ananas as well
Ananas or death
We've got elections coming up in May, we should really be able to do this
If we don't, we're fucked anyway
me2, but the small pools are fine too
Funfact: If you look at the border between Belgium and Germany you can see the lines to some wierd overlap thing
This is called the Rennbahn or something like that
Its a strip of belgian land about the size of a small street that "cuts" through the german land
Yes, if you run you can go from germany to belgium and back to germany within seconds
Basically, after war when terretory was being declared, belgium insisted that a specific railway that both starts and ends in belgium, but passes german land, has to stay completely belgian
Which germany agreed to
At some point the railway got obsolete and was replaced by a cycling path, but the land remained belgium
There is even a place where only a single house is german and everything surrounding it is belgian
what a twat
plus they got Irn-bru, what's not to love
I applied to a Scottish uni two years ago and they said I was only considered an European if I had lived the last three years in Europe (I hadn’t), which is so fucking fucked up
"Damn Scots, they ruined Scotland
"Scotland cannot discriminate against citizens of other eu countries
" English are not citizens of "other EU country". Basically, denmark could say: All EU citizens except Danish citizens can got to uni for free". Of course nobody does that
And people wonder why the right is having a resurgence
Can only hope something will happen to deal with this problem
Oh yeah, this thread will go great
Edit: Which was to be proven
At this point it's pretty much safe to assume that the ones who don't support this shit are the outliers
No such thing as a "moderate" in that death cult
Maybe that will happen I don't know can't look into the future
But people feel helpless and they fell enraged when they read about a teacher getting **beheaded** because he showed a picture and when people feel threatened with no help in sight then they will turn to extremes good or bad be damned

I think German astronaut Alexander Gerst jamming with Kraftwerk was pretty cool
Do they plan to cook meth in space or what
If ESA put together a manned mission to the moon, Mars or even an asteroid that could happen, but as cool as the Rosetta mission was, that's the only major ESA mission I even heard of
I know China also has a space program because it's featured in The Martian movie/book
According to a German EMT, 112 works in the USA and 911 works in the EU
Just in case visitors need to call for  help
This worked for me in Spain - I called 911 in the hopes of getting someone new  who spoke English, as I do not speak Spanish
I got a Spanish speaking operator and a translator on the line, which wasn’t bad
911 also works almost everywhere
doesn't sound so backwards to me; calling to have a fire put out (and being asked for relevant details) is something very different than reporting a heart attack (and being given first responder medical support)
but maybe I'm just saying that because I'm so used to also havinv three numbers (among a few others nobody knows about or remembers during an emergency)
would one single number actually be easier
but they would still have to put you through to the relevant emergency service, no
I had no idea lol just the other day I wondered how fucked I'd be in an emergency bc I've been watching too much US TV and my mind immediately goes to 911 while my brain is also eternally confused which number is for which emergency service in Austria
(if I had to dial quickly I mean)

Good guy Dublin Airport selling bottled water after checking-in for just 1 €. Shame yourselves all other airports ripping off thirsty travellers
And by not having to pay an employee they probably still make money on this, even though some people might just take water without paying for it
But in all honesty, I wish more airports would adopt something like this
Why don't you drink tapwater in Europe
It's perfectly clean in practically all the places
I highly disagree
Shame on all airports that don't provide free tap water (or filtered, if tap water isn't drinkable there) behind security
Thanks
Definitely
I doubt that they have to pay much more than 10-20 Cent per bottle when they buy them
1 pay roughly 10c/m³
Yeah
Quite a nice markup
Servas
Probably more expensive
Upkeep, more complex restocking, buying the vending machine, etc
But you don't need a technician to do it

Huh, now that I'm thinking about it like that it's really kind of weird, in a gross way
Nope, not the nose
See the upper lip
It has a dip in it, sort of like a half-circle curving inwards
That looks like a mouth to me (with a really derpy expression), with the gaping *real* mouth being the neck
Funny austria isn't there, seeing as Conchita once won
No we Are not on the shortlist yet

In a more serious note - he has no real power afaik ? And the parties in power are apparently not so eager

So 5 years and a few months in Austria
Our politicians always wait until Germany does something and then copy it
Because the state values the stabilizing effects people in long-term relationships have on society as a whole
Marriage is a show of commitment to such long-term relationships, and as such the state chooses to reward it
Coming from another single man btw
I would've suspected Austria to be way more sceptical of their children dating a muslim
Not ok, just a lot more understandable given current tensions

I already voted nobody in who is for this bullshit, what else can I do but not vote for these madmen
Shouldn't there be a purchase/price icon beside the links as well
Same
Basically, it's just wasting a vote
Yeah I can only vote for the greens, and they are so out of touch with reality they aren't even in our national parliament anymore, but at least they are so far removed from reality that I can vote for them there, as someone who loves in reality has to actually implement their ideas from there
And the big parties either voted for it, or didn't vote at all (which is just as bad as voting for it)

Let's see where this is going
Personally, I don't really know what to think of the green surge in countries around Europe but let's see what they are made of
Pray for Germany
Damn, Liechtenstein
The most murderous country in western europe
as a Slovak who works in Austria who likes to travel, euro makes my life significantly easier :) have you ever been in Prague
i have a feeling everyone wants to scam you there
even freaking ATMs scam you
90% of these scams would be gone if they had euro
Its funny how countries who are benefiting so much from their EU membership hate on the union so much
It gives individual states more options regarding ~~fiscal~~ monetary ~~politics~~ policy by manipulating the value of the currency
also there is no such thing as a non-bank atm in slovakia
i've never seen one, maybe there are some in bratislava
if you come from slovakia you have no reason not to trust an atm
you don't need to say that to me
i think i'm smart enough not to get scammed ;)
well that may be easy in your country
since we have euro the exchange offices are practically non-existent in slovakia
and banks take too long to get you the money and it's just too complicated
it's easier to come to the country and get the money there when needed
many people also don't feel comfortable walking around with big amounts of cash if you go abroad for longer periods of time
so no
it's easier to just come to an ATM and take out smaller amounts
also as i mentioned since non-bank ATMs in slovakia don't exist you have no reason to not trust an ATM
This is real summer weather
You're just not used to it anymore after all those extremely hot years

He was actually not wrong
Don’t forget Africa, yugoslavia, greece and so on
Yes minor fronts, but in the end these, the Atlantic wall, and so on bound forces
The assessment that Germany can’t wage a war on multiple fronts by the soviet generals was imho not wrong

Fuck I thought that was modern day Cersei Lannister
Kant lived in the 18th century so any implication of racism in the modern sense is ridiculous
He could only ever see the world as it was to him and of course today the circumstances would be vastly different and he would accept other ethnicities as being acceptable and necessary
„Handle so, daß die Maxime deines Willens jederzeit zugleich als Prinzip einer allgemeinen Gesetzgebung gelten könne
“ implores the listener to to act in a way that could be the basis foundation of a universal legislation
As multiethnicity is a basic reality and a basic necessity of modern societies, acceptance of other ethnicities is needed for a modern society to funtion
Thus Kant already tells us how he would act
Good thing you mentioned the soruce

Thats 6 buckets of Sauerkraut right there

That stuff holds months, if not over a year if you store it right

I was bored during the lockdown and created a "how to divide Austria" map
As an Austrian, absolutely everything about these maps is accurate
Explanation:
Territory: [South Tyrol]
West/East: Eastern Austria is influenced by Balkan-countries
Unfortunately this is not only being used as a compliment
In the eastern part of Austria the economy is weaker than in the west and the mentality is also more relaxed
There is a saying that the Balkan always starts 20km east from where you live
Famous exports:
[Ski lifts]
[Covid-19]
Red Bull
Josef Fritzl
[Antifreeze Wine]
Dialects: I'm sure a lot of my fellow Austrians will complain about this map
It's really simplified as often every valley and village has its own dialect
Krkrk: Tyrolleans pronounce words like Innsbruck or lecker with a "kr". Innsbruckrr, leckrrr, etc
Diminutive:
"Inselen, Schallalen, Gabalen". (Some) Carinthians like to make words cuter
It's like saying doggie instead of dog or ringlet instead of ring
Prolonging the words: "Heaaaast oidaaa, hosd a boa schülling fia de haaaazung"
In the east they like to prolong the pronunciation
As an upper-austrian living in Vienna I can absolutely confirm the language parts of upper austria and Vienna
Immerhin wissens endlich wos a Mohnflessal is
Btw, Austrian tongue-twister even difficult for natives:.
"Er hot s'Bsteck zspät bstöt"
(He ordered the cutlery too late)
The West/East comparison is totally not accurate but the rest certainly is
Vienna “ Wannabe Standard German” there is no way you can count yourself as Austrian after that
Beim ersten Bild hast Bayern vergessen sonst schöne Arbeit
Gotta say, this is pretty accurate
Except for maybe the "politics" part
I grew up in eastern Styria and it's very much ÖVP country, not red
Thanks a lot :)
Haha yes I know them
The saying in Tyrol is that everything east of Tyrol is the Balkan
Short explanation: Jörg Haider with his FPÖ-party was one (if not the first) modern right-wing populist in Europe/the world
Salzburg is attracting mostly Americans and Asians
They often expect and like that stuff unfortunately
Oh and it's easier to rip tourists off with those things haha
Depends on the Viennese you speak
The "original" dialect is really sweet
People who speak Schönbrunner Deutsch make me want to swim face down in the Danube
> viennese is hands down the nicest german dialect
Disagreed but apparently i bark (though graz isn't quite as barky as the rest)
May I introduce you to A[ustrian Standard German]
It's shocking how many people - even austrias - aren't aware of the fact that there is an official, well definded correct way of österreichisches Hochdeutsch - just as official as the german standard german they speak in Germany
Nowadays most people in Vienna don't speak Viennese anymore, instead they use a more standard German with remnants of the dialect here and there, the extent of which may vary for different districts and social classes
Its more about new viennese which is very piefkenesisch
Thank you :)
Your words mean more to me anyway ️
As someone living in said area, I would like to apologize
A few minutes earlier somebody criticized me for using Lwiw :(
Been there, done that
Didn't work out
The Balkan always starts 20 km east of where you live ;D
Sorry :(
A lot actually
Here is one:
I love your enthusiasm about Austrian men
Scchwarzenegger is from the region where it says "barking dogs" on the dialect-map
Only people in this area talk similar to him
I would say everybody in Austria understands this Styrian dialect
Jaaa das war ja uuuur leiwand
[Watch this video] and tell me again that this is not a "wanna-be High German"
It's more comparable to how you pronounce "ayyy" in English
At least that was not intentionally haha
Always true
Except on those days when wine>beer
it's just that we in the east see people in the mountain regions as mountain hillibillies
Gut, dass du fragst
Ja, ihr seid wirklich wo angrennt ;D
Ernsthaft: Da gings mit um diesen Neu-Wiener Dialekt
Den sprechen leider immer mehr und der klassische Wiener Dialekt geht verloren
just listen to schwarzenegger german interview in the 80s
It's comparable to the sound of an "ay" in English or an "ou" in German
A good example would be this [video between 10 seconds and 12 seconds]
The state of Upper Austria
So the one with Hitler and Hallstatt
Before the town of fucking got renamed I originally had the village in the Tourism-map
As Fucking(now Fugging) and Hallstatt (the small red dot below "All of Asis") are only villages I didn't know how to do it better than just write cities under quotation marks
Basically [free market capitalism]
Lord have mercy
Exactly
Instead of Insel they (sometimes/often) use Inselen
Similar to doggie instead of dog or ringlet instead of ring
1) It's beautiful so please stay
2) Culturalle they are still close to the rest of Austria (although ther are differences of course)
3) Please don't

The funny thing is:
I originally had Fucking in the Tourism-map
[Here's what it looked like (it's the one where it say Brits and Americans]
As they renamed it removed it from the map :(
Es gab bis vor Kurzem ein Dorf in Österreich mit dem Namen "Fucking". Es war ein beliebtes Ziel bei englischsprachigen Leuten
Im Dezember habens das aber in Fugging umbenannt
Als ich diese Karte erstellt hab, hieß es noch Fucking und war im "Tourism" Teil eingezeichnet
Da es nur ein Dorf war, hab ich Cities unter Anführungsstriche gesetzt
Jetzt vorm Posten hab ichs aber noch entfernt, das "Cities" lies ich aber so stehen
Of course ️
Haha it's okay :)
It was crossposted to r/mapporn I think, maybe that's where you saw it
99% of us are
It's just harmless teasing
ok my bad
Pretty sad that you don’t learn your own history apparently since Italian irrendentism claimed Corsica, Nice, Savoy, Istria, Dalmatia, Malta and so on
All of this lead to the reintegration in WW2
It's been pretty much the most beautiful, magical part of the country, simply cut out of it
I mean, what do you expect
But with the EU it's all history anyway, or at least should be
"Austria" and "Italy" should be a thing for the past
Was ??? Ja peinlich ka wir reden alle scho so im classic Wienerisch aber ja Großstadt hat halt immer weniger Dialekt :/ eh schod .
Ah yeah, the "Heurigen" of the Danube region are a thing of beauty
Glad you liked it
Glad you made it to a good Heurigen - nowadays there are those tourist-traps-"Heurigen" as well, with overprized mediocer food and kitschy music
Ja echt extrem schade:(
I will piss on your beaches next holiday for that

Yeah
Not in Vienna atleast
A childhood without Asterix & Obelix must be a very sad one
I was able to read them before I was able to write my own name
Austrian here, totally grew up with Asterix and Obelix
My Dad opposed pretty much all other comics and considered them to be worthless literature, but he also love Asterix and we had all books
My favorite one is "Asterix in Britain".
"Can I have a spot of milk in my hot water please
Or when they drive the romans crazy by having their tea break during the battles
"Oh, it´s time". :D
We used Asterix comics in school to learn Latin
I personally prefer the old animated feature films, they were fantastic
I did
Austrian here
Asterix and Obelix, very funny
Verleihnix (Ordralfabétix) literally means "lends-nothing", which I actually find quite fitting for that character
It's our privilege
Switzerland with female suicides looks pretty  nice
I totally mis-read the female graph
I think the crime rate per capita is actually quite high due to tourists and the low absolute population

Sad to see us Austrians missing, as our beer is clearly above all ;D
I'd be interested what that means in a per capita way
It's far easier to be a huge country and being a huge producer, but that doesn't necessarily say they are the most industrious in that endavour
As an Austrian on the proud second place, i tip my hat
That's quite a lead you got there
I thought that we were close since Austria is number 2
Holy shit
Looks like CGI
damn nice
What did we do again
Austria is neutral, so unless you're counting Afghanistan I don't know when they ever went to war
In which war did the neutral austria participate since ww2
What
Austria
What war are we talking about
Iceland participated in [ISAF] in Afghanistan, which seems to count here as war (same thing for Austria and Finland)
There is always a bit of grey zone with peacekeeping and other UN sanctioned security missions (such as ISAF)
Finally Iceland also seems to have had 2 soldiers in the Iraq war
Welcome to the Club (Austria, Finland - perhaps others)
It seems they count some UN mandate missions (such as ISAF) as wars
Has to be selective somehow, as Switzerland also participates but they are listed as 0
> Welcome to the Club
This map is hot garbage
The one in Afghanistan was a peace keeping and humanitarian mission tough
If you were to include this one you would have to include all of them (e.g. Bosnia, Kosovo, Mali, Lebanon, etc
) - [here's a list of all foreign deployments by our military]

Interesting that Germany imports way more from the EU than outside of the EU

Americans can be lucky, that they don't bring the good, cheap European cars to the US
They don't even sell the VW Polo or Skodas over there
Somebody needs to repeat that to Americans everyday
American cars are shit, pure unadulterated shit
Except for Tesla
There's one American automaker who's quite prevalent on European streets: Tesla
After Snowden leaks, Software or Hardware (Firewalls) with "made in the USA" should be less popular
But its not and this is why we need to create more awareness
I see them relatively often
About 1% of the cars I'd say
Though, they do stick out because of their sleek design

A lot of countries don't have a system of dual education and in some you get a Bachelor (counting as tertiary) for a job that is only availabe via Apprenticeship (secondary) here
Using international/US based categories for regions with a system that very different results in "bad" prejudices even if the education itself is better
Yeah, probably the map doesn't account for different education systems at all
Holy shit

Abortion and especially abortion after rape is not forbidden in Islam
I was taught that it is indeed allowed in the first few months of pregnancy

Most conservative parties do have programs and members that are homophobic, sexist and racist

No worries, MS is doing much of the invasive stuff in W10 also in the EU

A particular german news outlet tried it
Google just stoped linking them and in the end they got less traffic and less income
But let's try it again
maybe it will work the second time right
The entire link tax just won't work out as expected
If I would be FB or Google I would simply block everyone which asks for money ONCE
Nothing simpler then adding the link into a database which blocks it on my site
Guess whut happened to a certain german news outlet after google blocked them
Their traffic broke down suddenly
who could have guessed that
And with this also their income form the online website

British cuisine isn't "shit", it's just very unremarkable

In my local supermarket eggs are in the refrigerator

I once went hiking in the alps and one of my new colleagues was coming with me and some friends - he was from the Netherlands - so we start walking - an easy hike from 1500 to 2500 meters in 7 hours or so - he forgot something in the car and I told him that we will wait - he said no - we shall go ahead since he is running marathons - well - let's say that the thin mountain air even on just over 1500m was a bit more then he expected
I think he might be referring to the largest war theatre and highest casualties in world history when those countries were at war for almost half a decade
Slightly more relevant, no
So is this really how it happened, they built those beautiful solid structures for an Expo only to be removed 6 months later
Man that's something else

And yes, Germans ARE in fact morally superior than Americans for the most part
How many millions of people did the US slaughter in the past
You do realise that the establishment of Indian Reservations in the US were an influence on Nazi concentration camps, right
Germans are morally superior to Americans
You know why
Because most Germans today do not cling to stone age beliefs and religious propaganda like Americans
The US is a nation that executes minors, even to this day
You cannot get much more ‘morally inferior’ than that
Let’s not forget the ‘morally superior’ denial of medical care to people who lack the money
Those are all surely signs of a truly ‘enlightened’ society

hehe, first I had to look it up to make sure there was no special u-after-g-but-not-ü rule coming into play; the finer points of Spanish orthography can get tricky for me (especially when you throw Catalán into the mix)
Looks quite straightforward to me now though
Maybe it is because in the Austrian variant of German, we also tend to do "lazy" g's like in Spanish ("In Austrian German, intervocalic /b, d, ɡ/ can be lenited to fricatives [β, ð, ɣ]" conf
"The phonemes /b/, /d/, and /ɡ/ in Spanish are realized as approximants (namely [β̞, ð̞, ɣ˕]")
I can already hear it in my mind though how it would sound in a more North German, tight /u/, lenis /k/ accent

Well, sort of yes and no
Firstly, the College d'Europe was founded in the spirit of the pan-European movement, but it's in no way affiliated to the EU, but rather a private college subject to Belgian law
Its student population is tiny at less than 500 and the curriculum contains only law and political science
What many envisage is a public institution tied to EU law where actual research is conducted (instead of being focused on teaching), at a much larger scale, a competitive budget, all branches of science represented, in the same spirit as Erasmus

Austria was already a dictatorship when Hitler took over, the Nazis killed even the dictator which established it during a failed coup

Yeah I think Schuschnigg was a hard smoker and legend has it that Hitler once once inveted him to negotiations in the Berghof, where smoking was prohibited
The negotiations took very long, which led to Schuschnigg becoming very nervous because he wanted to smoke, while Hitler stayed calm, and actually had factored that in
I hope I'm not mixing anything up here, maybe it wasn't Schuschnigg

Weil der Austrofaschismus – im Gegensatz zur NS-Zeit – ein nach wie vor politisch umzanktes Tabuthema ist
Es ist nicht immer 100%ig klar wer da jetzt "die Bösen" sind auf die man mit dem Finger zeigen kann und das macht es oft schwierig
Wie viele NS-Gedenkfeiern gibt es, wie oft hört man öffentliche Personen sich an die NS-Zeit erinnern
Da weiß man *wie* man drüber sprechen kann
Wie oft dagegen passiert das mit der Dollfuß-Schuschnigg-Zeit
Ist viel schwieriger, weil sich sofort jemand auf den Schlips gtreten fühlt
Politisch umzankt ist es im Sinne von, wie man die Zeit bewertet
Das fängt an wie man die Zeit bezeichnet
Ständestaat
Austro-Faschismus
Österreichischer Faschismus (die Kompromisslösung schlechthin)
Bundesstaat Österreich
Viele Konservative (*ahem* CV *ahem*) halten Dollfuß für einen Österreich-Patrioten, ja Märtyrer (wurde ja von Nazis ermordet), der sich dem deutschen NS-Einfluss und dem Anschluss zu erwehren versucht hat
"Weil ohne Faschismus wären wir ja gleich von den Nazis überrannt worden, oder wir wären unter den Roten eine Sowjetrepublik geworden
Die Diktatur war der einzige Ausweg um unser Land zu beschützen
", ist da ein (nicht ganz richtiges) Argument, das ich schon sehr oft gehört habe
Viele Rote sehen in ihm einen Arbeitermörder und klerikal-faschistischen autoritären Diktator, der das Rad der Zeit am liebsten um 150 Jahre zurückgedreht hätte, der politische Gegner über paramilitärische Milizen verfolgen ließ, Frauen zurück an den Herd verbannen wollte, der kath
Kirche enormen Einflus zusprach und der daneben auch noch ein ordentlicher Antisemit und Antiziganist war (was oft vergessen wird)
Die heutigen Parteien ÖVP und SPÖ waren in den 50ern ja personell nahtlose Fortsetzungen der Zwischenkriegs-SPÖ bzw
der Zwischenkriegs-Christlichsozialen=Vaterländische Front
Die Nazis haben die eingefleischten (d.h. nicht übergelaufenen) Anhänger beider Parteien später gnadenlos verfolgt und in KZs gesteckt
Man hat halt nach den Nazis gesagt "Lasst uns das Kriegsbeil begraben und das ganze Thema noch dazu, arbeiten wir zusammen und reden nie wieder über diese Zeit
" So kommts dann zu solchen verrückten Geschichten und nach wie vor andauernder Dollfuß-Verehrung (oder zumindest kritikloser Mythenbildung) innerhalb der ÖVP
Most people would think it's an imperial eagle, as it is very similar
Yes, what I meant is, everybody there speaks Basque 95% of the time
My gf's cousins like to half-joke that I know better Spanish than them

Interesting, thanks for that
Man hat einfach im KZ erkannt, dass die Blutfeindschaft zwischen den Parteien zu einer unerträglichen Zuspitzung der Lage geführt hat
Die Politiker in Österreich sind erst in dieser Not wirkliche Demokraten geworden
Für die SdAP war der Marxismus in der ersten Republik auch wichtiger als die Demokratie
Daher auch die Paranoia der CSP
Umgekehrt natürlich genauso
Nach dem Krieg, und das muss man beiden Parteien hoch anrechnen, haben sie sich dann gemeinsam gegen die Besatzung gestellt
Besonders dass die SPÖ die Weitsicht hatte, sich nicht an die KPÖ anzunähern, hat uns da vermutlich den stalinistischen Terror und eine Teilung des Staates wie in Deutschland erspart
Das ganze hatte sich die KPÖ auch selbst zuzuschreiben
Während SdAP uns CSP/VF Politiker trotz aller Differenzen im KZ zusammenstanden, hat die KPÖ allen Kontakt und allen Zusammenhalt verweigert
Da haben die SdAP Politiker wohl auch die Verachtung der Kommunisten auf die Sozialdemokratie mit voller Härte realisiert
War halt ne ziemlich beschissene Zeit für alle in nem Staat der einen großteil seines Landes und seiner Macht verloren hatte
Während die Sozis Stalins Schwanz gelutscht haben und allen eine Utopie versprachen gingen in der Sowjetunion gerade die Säuberungen los
Hat natürlich die Schwarzen nicht kalt gelassen und die haben sich genauso radikalisiert und mit Mussolini Stellung bezogen
Beide scheiße aber beide im angesicht der Situation mehr oder weniger unausweichlich
Der Bürgerkrieg und die Diktatur war eh abzusehen
The fascist flag had a cross similar to the iron cross on it
[They are not] as they are not crossed
You have to see the tools as part of a trio with the (also golden) mural crown, which turns it into a very strong republican symbol
Together they represent the three parts of society that (in the mind of someone born in the 19th century) make up the republic: Farmers, workers, and burghers
This emphasis on republicanism was a big deal in 1919, when this CoA was made
Because Austrians had just gotten rid of the Habsburger, after almost 800 years, so being a republic was a big deal
However (and most Austrians don't realize this either) the colors of the CoA are black (eagle), red (tongue), and gold (the "trio", the beak and the fangs), which is a hint to the [traditional pan-German colors] (i.e. Germany including Austria), which also have a strong republican connotation – opposed to the Prussian-dynastic black-white-red
The broken chains were added after WWII and signify overcoming fascism
In Austria nobody really thinks the hammer and sickle in our CoA have to do anything with communism, so it's not really an issue either
It's kinda comparable with the fasces in the national emblem of France, which – here – also isn't a fascist symbol, but a republican one
I think they are supposed to represent the different classes in the country
A crown for aristocracy, a hammer for workers and a sickle for farmers
The eagle was adopted from the austrian empire which in turn had taken it from the romans
Okay
Yeah that's right
I did not know that and it's fucked up
When did that happen
> Der Bürgerkrieg und die Diktatur war eh abzusehen
Haha
Ja, fast 100 Jahre später kann man das natürlich mal so lässig behaupten goi
You mean the [Kruckenkreuzflagge] (which was a co-offical flag, next to the regular red-white-red)
I think the above user is referring to the double headed eagle Coat of Arms of the Austrofascist state, [which can be seen on top of the Austrian flag in the English Wikipedia] But afaik that was never an official flag
*Maybe* it was used like the [Bundesdienstflagge] is used today, but that is speculation on my part
> A crown for aristocracy
The *mural* crown (Mauerkrone, kleiner aber wichtiger Unterschied) is for the burghers
The aristocracy was stripped of all its privileges and titles in the new republic
Which is why noble titles are officially banned in Austria still today
Naja ist eben in vielen Ländern der Welt zu der Zeit ähnlich abgelaufen, beide Seiten haben sich polarisiert bis es dann zur Entladung kam z.B in  Spanien

Crying because they're not in the EU and therefore exempt from deletion
But
Pasta, my dude
_Sigh
_ Can't even blame you
Seriously the Great Lakes are so gorgeous, I wouldn't mind having those right outside my window hah
Looking at the Moldau towards Krumlov I assume you'll be fine
Well, as per the criteria laid out by OP, Vatican is cheating
>and with no children as citizens
That we know of
The Vatican cellars are sealed for a reason
'tis decided then
In Austria you get a double salary twice a year
Once in the summer and once around Christmas
Presumed consent makes a lot more sense
We have that since 1980 I believe
I don’t know the exact law, but in Austria companies pay a yearly fine if they don’t have a certain percentage of disabled employees
I think it is one disabled person per 25 employees
However, the fine is so inconsequential that the last two companies I worked at just paid the fine
According to this [website by the austrian government] there was a suggestion of the European council 1978 so apparently we were quite early
very atypical for my country :)
Even tho video games are obv art
Too sad not really any country recognises that
Felt so unnecessarely extra playing the austrian/german version of kino der toten with all the swastikas removed
Like who are they doing this for
Well atleast Brexit is gonna move forward now, and the EU can deal with more important issues than the Brits
He looks like a second Trump
Im about as much a fan of Boris Johnson then i am a fan of Trump
both should sit in prision
one for fucking a pug and another for selling out his country to the highest bitter
I really don't care
Uk continues to fuck itself
Hopefully he can finally make their brexit dream a reality and we can move on from them having such a big impact on the EU to a lesser impact
Declaring war on Serbia in 1914 proved quite the "bruh moment" in retrospect
Drunk attacking our own army
Well
We had some
Which one do you want to hear
Declaring neutrality is one thing
Austria and Prussia changed sides

A true albanian
Why would you lie about something so embarrassing though
When I was younger I was kinda naive
I thought one of my friends family was poor
They have a nice/average house but only an old car and only went on a budget holiday every few years
Also they never went to a shopping mall which was odd for me
Nowadays I know that I was just in a middle class bubble in the countryside where I've never seen real poverty
I personally consider somebody poor who lives in tiny flat, can't go on holiday and struggles affording small things like a cinema-visit, comfortable shoes, barber, etc
This is something I have to blame myself too for
I am definitely raised in middle class (Dad working in a high rank in government (Hofrat)) environment
Not rich but we are talking about a salary of about 5000-6000€/month (or the equivalent in Schilling, even though my Dad never disclosed how much he earned to me or my sister), but still pretty high above average and always enough to go on vacation once a year, that I had a (used) car when I turned 18 and stuff like this
And I didn´t realize back then that this is NOT something that is normal
I remember that I wanted to go to the gym and my parents paid for a years membership and I didn´t think much about it
I would have wanted my best friend (whose parents were not that well off, but also not poor neither) to join me there but he couldn´t afford it
It took me many years to realize that I was totally ignorant back then and how spoiled I have been
I did learn my lesson though (later in life)
Just one dish explains it: Deep fried Mars bars
Yes
I think it has something to do with convenience, sometimes the English expression is just so much simpler than the German one (big surprise, i know) that i tend to use it more, simply out of laziness
Also when i've been abroad for a few weeks time it has happened that i completely blank out on some German expressions altogether, standing there looking for what i wanted to say like someone learning the language from new
That feels
odd
Well I sometimes even think in english and then can't remember simple words in my own Language
Right now, I use english more than german
I’m barely on any german site or social media, so I don’t write in german often and at this point I understand english better than my native language
I regularly forget german words too
I often also just say „Fuck it“ and use Denglisch when I‘m lazy enough (Denglisch = German and English at the same time [my german-speakers please don’t kill me])
My friends don‘t really care, except some that say they can „speak really good in english“ and afterwards don‘t understand a single word I use, but then I just explain what I mean and sometimes they tell me the word I‘m looking for
It's gone so far that I often forget normal words in my native language in casual conversation while knowing exactly what I want to say in English
I don't notice it much nowadays, but I remember a time when I would think of something and had serious troubles expressing myself, because there was either no good expression in German, or I couldn't finish a train of thought in German the same way I could in English
Yeah, my vocabulary is more limited in german and I forget words pretty often
The stereotypical one
No, and to be honest I barely like any English accent
Like, not even the British accent sounds weird to me, but that‘s probably because I‘m so used to hearing/speaking American English
It‘s probably also the reason why I practiced my English so much to the point where I barely have an accent/have the American Accent
However, if I e.g. have to pronounce a brand name out of nowhere I might have an accent for a short period of time and I hate that one
That‘s why I avoid pronouncing certain brand names if I spoke German for a long period of time prior
I think it's because it reminds us of our bad classmates who it always took 10 minutes to finish reading one paragraph aloud
I think my accent isn't all that noticeable
At least that's what native speaking friends as well as my teacher told me
And the native speaker
They said I sounded like a posh English kid from Cambridge
My teacher once joked that with that accent I would get beat up by angry and drunk Scotsmen if I ever were to visit some of the more dingy pub's in some parts of England
Good times
I am the only one of my friends having an iPhone and I am kind of getting teased about it bc at least on the countryside it‘s somehow considered as a phone for
-wannabe teenage influencer girls
-people who buy tech stuff for the looks
-people with an attitude
-people with low self esteem
-also some people consider it as gay if a boy has an iPhone (It‘s Austria, people are conservative in a really weird way)
I personally just don't like Apple and I think that brand is quite unpopular here anyway not only when it comes to phones
Macs are not that common
Since most people got Windows it's easier to have windows yourself and it becomes the quasi-standard
iPhones work really well together with Macs and the whole Apple ecosystem
Since hardly anyone is using Macs that whole reason of getting an iPhone isn't there
I know some people in Austria who have iPhones and their main reason is because they are using Macs
Apple never reached the kind of market penetration it has in the US
Some of its services that made it popular in the US are not offered or relevant here, or there just never was a good enough *reason* to switch away from Windows/Android
Competition by cheaper manufacturers from China is strong, capturing the "I don't care I just want a cheap phone to call my grand kids" crowd
iPhones are more expensive and luxurious in design and marketing, and while that can be seen as an advantage, one shouldn't forget that there's a decidedly anti-consumerist streak in Austrian culture
I'd say that among some groups, flounting your material wealth is kind of looked down upon, while going the hipster/eco-friendly/beige jute bag route is seen as more favorable (among educated people)
For these people, not owning a car and having a small, old and "sensible" phone is preferable to the "white and gold" of Apple products
I can only really comment on younger people with a university education here, but among those, white iPhones, Gucci bling and Luis Vuitton bags is definitely looked down upon as a class identifier, and seen as only being liked by working class Turkish immigrant kids, chavs and gopnis, maybe those who didn't go to university and started working right away when the were 20, and "basic" people (Tussis, basically those who study law or economy and who party at posh inner district clubs instead of at raves, festivals or more alternative clubs)
I think it's less that and more that the us has a culture of frivolous spending (seen also in those huge weddings for example) and necessity for status symbols, and the iPhone is incredibly attainable for that purpose, unlike a huge wedding/house/car, and you can show it off to others all the time
Hah
Especially the more technological affinity the people judging you have (looking at you, HTLs)
Just wanted to say that from one schnitzel to another
> some people consider it as gay if a boy has an iPhone
What
And even if, so what
Imagine using gay as an insult in the year two thousand and twenty (2020)
What kind of idiot would say that
Du schwuchtel host a iPhone
Geh schleicht di
>-also some people consider it as gay if a boy has an iPhone (It‘s Austria, people are conservative in a really weird way)
The fuck
I haven't been a teenager for the better part of two decades but, again, what
Also yeah kids are stupid and break their stuff all the time so they have no business having a 1000€ iPhone
Much more fiscally responsible to get them a 200€ phone every year when they've shattered their screen
You're making it sound like there aren't any alternatives to apple products (itunes was discontinued a while ago, btw)
You can use Spotify and google maps etc
without any problems on apple devices
I'm listening to Spotify right now, never felt like bothering with Apple Music
Didn't have any problems connecting my non-apple speakers to my apple devices either
You‘re 100% right
Thanks for the input, fellow schnitzel
100% went to HTL
Every Iphone user was seen as a tech illiterate just for having one
Totally agree
Interesting
I commented on it [above] but I think over here it's actually -3 charisma
I mean if you buy some rather unknown brand or brand known for building cheap phones then yes
But I don't see a difference in that regard between a Samsung phone or an iPhone
You know what you are getting with a Samsung Phone
It's strange to view actual choice as a negative thing
Exactly
I always wondered about this, and this thinking does not only exist in the US - if anything I will think more of you if you obtained a good phone for minimum price and didn't throw it all out for sleek design
Ugh, it's a stuttery slow mess
And those bubbles
So glad over here it's WhatsApp, the UI is way better imho
Have the 6T and it Works like a charm
It's a nice size and not heavy at all
The design is nice and the phone is bug free since i bought it on its release
Wels has a far-right major and problems with ethnic communities
It's such a mis-managed city
But apart from that
Hard to say
We have a saying: "Wien ist anders" that literally translates to "Vienna is different"
There is a map of austria showing which parts of austria hate vienna, everything except vienna is white, which stands for hating vienna, and vienna is red, which also stands for hating vienna
I think St
pölten, BC it looks like the death star of star wars
People rant on St
Pölten, but other than being small for being the capital of the largest state, I don't see any problems with it
I completely forgot Wels existed
And I live 25km away from it
I was scanning the comments fearing someone would mention Linz (Linz may be very industrial, but it ain't that bad), or Vienna (which would be the typical anti-capital reflex; Vienna is fantastic)
Now that I see that Wels is being mentioned I'm content, because I would have said the same thing
Wels is ugly, soulless and irrelevant
I looks like *hingschlazt* along the Traun, completely pointless
And their mayor is a disgusting piece of shit
I hate it
When my dad was there they charged him 8€ for an Espresso
Pissed him off so much he stole the cup :D
Dragging down the GDP of the country would be ridiculous
You mean GDP per capita
Im from Freistadt lol
Its just that the rest of austria is more rural and even in the next biggest cities the people are a lot closer so the big city feels a bit distant from the rest
That combined with clichés of the people there not being able to drive properly makes us hate them(not all that seriously tho)
"Scheiß weana
Yeah, i know its pretty nice, but the rest of austria kinda looks down on it(some more jokingly some more seriously)
Dunno, I'd have to ask him
Thing is, he even speaks some half-decent Italian, so he isn't too touristy of a tourist
Still GDP per capita
Just the basic „Sorry, traffic jam“ or „Sorry, bus was late“ is usually the main excuse -we don‘t usually give reasons for running late, we just say „sorry, am late“ and that was pretty much it-
If that wears off, try "Got stuck on an escalator" instead
The guy who got completely wasted at the last Christmas party
I think that writing classical music was just a way for Austrians to look busy while procrastinating
We'd be the room between the western and eastern wing of the building
MA2412 wasnt too far off i guess lol
Wouldn´t it be more like the food truck across the street that EVERY employee just loves to go to and that then somehow thinks that he is working for the company too, because one tire of the food truck is actually on the company parking lot

My one favorite series is from America, the other from the UK
Besides I easily get confused by little things like fish n' chips
What are the chips now
Potatoes, fries or actually chips
Definitely
Absolutely, for spelling I use whatever seems more logical to me
* so an s if the question is s/z but the sound is s.
* The "correct" order of letters for words like "meter"
* no silent u-s, so it's color etc
And generally any expression I have picked up somewhere is fair game for me
Recently watched some austrialian and canadian tv-shows --> come into the mix
If I should ever move to an english-speaking country I would try to speak and write their version of the language, but as long as I am not why should I try to limit myself
Definitely
Also most books I read where us but most subtles I read where UK
So I just happily mix
The sheer amount of advertising and open display of patriotism felt very odd to me
Carpet floors in public buildings/offices
It's pretty disgusting
Carpet floors in general is something I don't get, but even at home some people keep their shoes on
while having carpet floors
Sizes of beverages/food
It's ridiculous
No wonder a large portion of the population is fat
They are already big in Austria (which is a reason why we are also fat) but it is no comparison
Also complete strangers talking to you
In NYC, where people are supposed to be the unfriendliest in the whole US
chlorine in tap water
That there seemed to be no normal restaurants like we have in Europe
It was either fast food or an expensive restaurant where you have to make a reservation
I'd say the urinal etiquette is the same in Austria, unless there's like a queue already waiting
It's funny, I feel the same way about every German I meet
I always thought, I had micro-balls when I heard about that stuff from Americans
In elementary school: Frau Lehrerin/Herr Lehrer
In middle school: Frau Fachlerer(in)/Herr Fachlehrer
In high school: Frau Professor/Herr Professor
All of them more or less meaning "Mr
/Mrs
teacher". Anything else would be super weird or rude
actually it's just a ln intercultural misunderstanding
for the huge amount of friendliness we expect very deep and long-lasting interest and a meaningful relationship
when we get fleeting interest and a noncommittal relationship instead, we can't help but feel "betrayed". you on the other hand find us stand-offish at first and then often surprisingly not as grumpy as you expected us to be, because the relationship level "just strangers having a chat" warrants much higher display of friendliness than we are prepared to give, but that changes more than you would expect it to
playing sounds of loudly flushing actually to mask for he sound of farts and actual shitting
Honestly I have the same problem, I'm often too nervous to say anything, so I usually hand them a sandwich without saying anything & when they thank me I just say "no problem" or wish them a good day
If they're not hungry at the moment they most probably will be in a couple of hours, so they will accept the food no matter what
Totally normal in Austria, nothing medieval about it
The conservatives get a authoritarian boner about the possibilities shown to them by Covid Contact tracking
Luckily nothing really (except some people in the government wanting to make a tracking app for Corona mandatory, but they seemingly changed their minds on it now), but I think with another FPÖ-ÖVP Government this would probably different
Didn't they even create an app where you can "anonimously" track your contact with other people
I saw the ad on TV
Certainly not using that
I don't trust them, they could certainly find some excuse to access that data
After all this is an emergency situation
Yeah, I simply don't trust them to press delete on that data afterwards
Could also be worse tho
I always liked the fact their abbreviation is what it is
Love it
Wilhelm (male), Ludmilla (female)
I think "Gottfrieda" is a pretty old one
"Brunhilde", I don't even know someone of that name
More common old-fashioned names would be "Fritz", "Franz", "Hans", ...
Definetly Josef for the boys and maybie Maria for the girls
Adolf somehow fell out of favour and Theodor or Alois is not so common anymore
For females I guess something like Margarete oder Gisela
Hildegard, Hagen, Hildebrand
There's also plenty of non-Germanic old-timey names
Like Ignaz, Matthäus, Genoveva, or Alma
There was a real life version of this in a cutre reality show on German TV
[A mother of 9 calling her kids to come down into the kitchen]
Silvana, Serafina, Estefania, Kilenta (?), Loredana (?), Gabriel/Fabienne (??), Lavinia (????), Jeremy, Pascal
Hartmann von Aue
We do have  [Edeltraud] (Edel = noble, traud = strength ) and  [Engelbert] (Engel =  [Angle] bert = shiny, famous)
which seem rather similar to Æthelbert
\[googles around\]
Apparently Æthelbert became Adalbert after the Norman conquest and it's Old High German (Adal = noble, bert = shiny, famous) in origin
Mine too, even in Austria
That's probably because I'm a man though
2050 is too late
"2050" is a code for "some point in the future which is far away enough so that I have to do diddly-squat during *my* term of office and after me the deluge
I love cars but I'm still not sad, it's going to be fine I'm sure
Alsatian obviously, duh
When I’m writing a long text, it sometimes happens that I can’t remember a word in my native tongue but I know what I want to say in English, so I have to translate the English word into my own language
Not exactly but sometimes when I hear/read something in English (I am Austrian) it takes me a few seconds to realize that it’s not German
I remember a scenario from yesterday:
So Austrian-German has many words that are different from German-German but are for the same things
So we have those words, but we still have to learn the standard-german version
So yesterday in german class we got a list with a few of those words and should translate every single one of them to standard-german and funnily enough, I could translate every single one of them to english but barely one of them to german
It doesn't sound like gibberish, but sometimes I can only think of the English version of a word or expression - in the middle of a german sentence
I always get everything mixed up when it comes to English and German
Words, pronounciation, grammar, literally everything you can mess up
Word order is one of the issues for me but not the biggest one at all
The name thing doesn’t happen to me at all
My mother told me to pronounce my name in English but I ignored her because my name sounds horrible in English and I couldn’t even really pronounce it if I wanted to
The word Austria is from proto-germanic
Austar meaning east and the latin word Austri meaning south
Overall, Austria can be translated as *The Mythical Dwarf Of The East
* The german name, Österreich, can be translated as Eastern Realm
Our flag, red-white-red, is said to be from the 11th century
Duke leopold came back from war and his white coat was drenched in the opponents blood, meaning he succeeded
He took off his scabbard and you could see a white line
It was the only place on his entire coat that wasn‘t red
The oldest zoo in the world is [Tiergarten Schönbrunn in Vienna] The first steps of an attempt of a zoo dating back to 1452 and the name Schönbrunn first shown on documents from 1642
The „birthday of the zoo“ is said to be July 31st 1752, when Emperor Franz Joseph I. Stephan first allowed friends and other visitors to go into the zoo
(Also short extra fact: Schönbrunn is one of the ten zoos in Europe that are allowed to have pandas
The panda baby Fu Long („Happy Dragon“) was the first panda baby in Europe to be bred naturally and be born in that very same zoo
[August 2007])
It‘s hard to count how many nobel prizes we have as a country, since the people that got them either had dual-citizenship when they got it or weren’t a citizen anymore
So we have either 18 or 31 nobel prizes as a country
We cherish our culture
If you‘re in Austria and see a festival where people wear traditional clothing like Dirndl or Steireranzüge, then those aren‘t paid actors
Those are normal people that just wore it
It also isn‘t considered abnormal to just run around in a Dirndl through Downtown
Well, you barely see it when there isn‘t a festival around, but people probably won‘t think you’re bonkers if you do it
Also, it‘s considered formal wear and you can get into many balls wearing it
You can honestly wear it almost anywhere, it‘s that weird thing between formal clothing but not formal enough to be considered weird if you wear it on a normal day
//////Also Styria is the federal state that has the most festivals about Austrian culture
Edit: spelling
According to legend, the Austrian flag is based on a blood soaked piece of cloth
Either way it is very old, having been in use in some way since at least the 13th century
The University of Vienna is the largest University in the German speaking region, with over 90
000 students
It is also the oldest, unless you count Prague which is no longer part of that region/category
Every democratic election in Vienna, the capital, since 1919 has been won by the same party
(Currently called the Socialdemocratic Party, the name changed a bit over time)
The "Allgemeine Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch" (General Civil Law Book
), first written in 1811, is almost(?) in its entirety still in use unchanged
I think it's where the civil/base rights are constitutionally noted, but I might be wrong on that, it's been a while
The "youngest" Austrian state is (probably
) Burgenland
It's the eastern most state and was part of Hungary until 1920/21
Vienna was first made its own state around the same time, in 1920
Austria:
Austria plays an important role as a kind of negotiator between east and west (especially in the cold war) because of our neutrality
To this day many important negotiations are held in vienna, like just recently represantatives of russia and the usa met in vienna to discuss a contract from the cold war which restricts the number of nuclear weapons in these countries
After the second world war Austria lost almost 90% of its Area and more than 80% of it's population
Since before 1918 it was Austria-Hungary which consisted of several other states as well like the czech republic and slovakia
Although Austria only has about 8
9 million citizens, many important and well known people are from Austria, people like Mozart, Falco, Niki Lauda, Arnold Schwarzenegger
Or others like Wolfgang Pauli, Erwin Schrödinger or Sigmund Freud
Austria is the only country in the world, where alpine skiing is considered a national sport
My country might not have been the most succesful one in wars
Still Austria gained much land in our history (for example there was a time the sun didn't set in Austria when spain and mexico belonged to us) due to their marriage policy
There was this motto "tu felix austria nube" which means something like: you happy austria, marry
Liechtenstein would like to have a word
> Also, it‘s considered formal wear and you can get into many balls wearing it
You can honestly wear it almost anywhere, it‘s that weird thing between formal clothing but not formal enough to be considered weird if you wear it on a normal day
To clarify: This doesn't mean it's a suitable replacement for a suit or dress
Unless everyone does it, you'd look whack as hell at a funeral
Generally, traditional clothing like Lederhosen and Dirndl are primarily worn to social events
Nobody wears them daily or for work
Unless the work requires it - plenty of inns, especially in rural areas will try to keep that look
I'm led to believe that you're from Styria, it might be the case that y'all wear them more often than we do
I‘ve been to Hvar once, can absolutely confirm the sunny part
got my life burnt out of me
Guessed it, I am from Styria
:D And yeah, maybe we do wear Dirndls and Steieranzüge/Lederhosen more often than other federal states (even though I refuse to believe that Salzburg or Tyrol isn‘t up there with us), but I think they aren‘t that unusual to be seen wearing in other federal states (Vienna maybe, but I personally have seen some people just go around with it in the city
I gotta say tho, I'm a big fan of wearing Lederhosen to any occasion (except stuff like funerals)
So comfy
[German version of wikipedia, name austria, not available in other languages for me]
> Die Bezeichnung geht jedoch nicht auf die lateinische, sondern auf die urgermanische Sprache zurück
Das althochdeutsche *austar- bedeutet soviel wie „östlich“ oder „im Osten“, und die altisländische Edda nennt den mythischen Zwerg des Ostens Austri
Eng mit dem Wort Austria verwandt sind auch die Namen Austrasien und Austrien für das Ostfrankenreich bzw
Ostreich
Auch in der älteren Bezeichnung Ostarrîchi ist die Wurzel ôstar- erkennbar
Die Ähnlichkeit mit dem lateinischen Auster für „Südwind“ und terra australis für das „Südland“ Australien ist zufällig
Translation:
> The name isn‘t rooted to the latin form, but to the proto-germanic language
The old german version *austar- meaning „eastern“ or „in the East“, and the old icelandic Edda calls the mythical dwarf of the east Austri
Closely related to the word Austria are the names Austrasien and Austrien for Eastfrance aka Eastrealm
Also in the old meaning Ostarrîchi is the root ôstar- present
The latin Auster for Southern land and terra australis for „Southern land“ Australia is a coincidence
Those Grand Duchies always thinking they're better than Principalities
Ts ts ts
The more rural an area gets, the more often you will see them
Along the more urban Danube, you see them less and less
Can't even recall the last time I saw someone with it, but that doesn't mean all that much, since it's not really noteworthy either
If there's people going out, though, chances are high that you run into someone rocking a Tracht or Dirndl
Someone just strolling around the Landstraße in Linz or the Mariahilfer Straße in Vienna is most likely not wearing it
There will be the odd one out once in a while, but it's rare
The only one left, Tuscany used to be one too
That would a very good idea be
I can me imagine, that regularly to do
I think I will that even in the future do
As you see, in German have we a very different structuring of sentences, which of course very difficult to read be can
Edit: I just sound like Yoda honestly
I know not, if I that can
It is pretty difficult, even though german english very similar is
Our grammar is very confusing, even for native speakers
But, just from grammar, are some sentences the english ones pretty similar
————
Today had I a math exam
It wasn‘t difficult, but I was really nervous
Otherwise was my day really nice
Right now driving I with the bus home
When I at home want I sleep

That idea I *do* like
A non-stop fuck fest basically
I think it’s more complicated then it seems at first
The reason those countries are excluded from the ESTA program is that they have a higher then 3% Visa refusal rate - mostly due to the risk of overstaying in the US (so basisally the risk of illegal immigration)
Now the reason for this risk is economic mainly - as such countries like Croatia and Poland will soon be included into the ESTA program (they have a refusal rate of around 5%) while Bulgaria and Romania have around 11-15%
The thing is - it’s not an arbitrary decision
If the EU would be one country (which it isnt) those parts would also enjoy visa free travel to the US - for now I do understand the decision though
Since it’s not based on „we don’t like you“ aka feelings but hard numbers which can be traced back and verified
I mean, they have the esta or what it's called for ages now which is basically a visa anyway (potato, ) so they are not upholding their part for the whole EU anyway, and I'd love for the EU to finally do something about it (apparently we're going to introduce an esta for Americans too, but that's just stopping to their level instead of having visa free travel for real)
Spent 2h waiting in Atlanta this year
They didn't even let non-american flights queue up for immigration lines: "US citizens only" they said, unable to respond to my "how long do we have to wait" question
When they were done with US citizens, they closed all counters except for 4
I loved standing in line for another hour due to that
It reminded me of all the reasons I cannot stand travelling there to begin with
Interesting thought to be honest - but I guess that would fall under sexism and thus can’t really be applied in this case
That’s not my point at all - If you’d ask me I think that all of the EU should be treated as one block for visa purposes cause then the visa refusal rate would be far below 3%.
The problem with this is though that recirprocity in Visa questions is not the strong suit of the EU - while I can travel to South Africa visa free for 90 days, South African citizens need a visa
So there are already quite well established cases in which the EU treats citizens of countries that offer visa free entry worse then EU citizens get treated by them
And this is the one case in which some EU citizens are excluded
If this should be the case between the two richtest political entities in the world is another question
The problem the US also has is that it doesn’t have an internal registration system - once you are in you are in
They don’t even have exit controls to check if you overstayed
And now you won’t even have the economic benefits
So much winning
Not really - cause you do apply it to all people
The problem is that the EU is not one country
In which case you would be right - that would be like saying “people from Bavaria can apply to ESTA - people from Berlin can’t”
But here they are saying that in the country of Croatia, x people get denied, and as such the country of Croatia won’t get access to ESTA
Other examples - for whatever reason Croatian nationals need a visa to Thailand and won’t get a VOA as the other 27 citizens of EU member states
Same for slovakians to South Africa
So as long as the EU doesn’t constitute itself as one country, with a unified immigration and visa policy (if you get a Croatian  visa you can’t  enter Schengen for example and to enter Croatia you need a multiple Schengen Visa not a single entry one ) the single states will continue to be looked at as single countries - and not as a member of a bigger whole - like the federal states of Germany of the USA
Well Brexit is a crazy shit show (that will hurt the British a lot more then they think) and trump is a complete imbecile
What do you expect ? Europe has to find positions on those two things - and since the UK as well as the US are on completely divergent paths from what Europe thinks is the future I don’t see how a certain amount of animosity is not to be expected
Well that’s fine then - but why is it a problem then for you that the EU will now give those benefits only to member states and exclude the UK from them ?
Cause I guess that’s what you mean with the claim
That the EU is behaving nationalistic
So far non one has called for an invasion of the UK or an embargo - it’s basically back to status quo ante
And if you are happy with that (which you apparently are) then I don’t see the problem
I don’t think that the people of the US or the UK are the enemy
But I do think that they made choices that are in conflict with the policies of the EU and as such the EU will have to find a way to deal with those choices
And the results of this won’t always be beneficial to UK/US relations with the EU
Don’t get me wrong - but you are basically say that the UK for example made its choice (Brexit) and the EU should just continue as before and if they change anything in the relations with the UK that’s nationalism and jingoism
That’s complete bullshit
What do you mean with hostile rethoric ?
Telling you that you won’t get preferential treatment ?
Telling you that imports / exports will be scrutinized ?
Telling you that the well being of British citizens is an afterthought over the well-being of EU citizens ?
Seriously - what did you expect ?
Business as usual ?
And as for Gibraltar - expect the EU from now on to be on the Spanish side of things - since you guys are not part of the club anymore
No I am not saying that - but if Spain decides to cut off Gibraltar from land access to Spain or decides to not let Gibraltar bound planes use its airspace (remeber no deal Brexit also means no open skies agreement)  - why should it intervene against a member state for a non member state ?
Now it’s “hey you can’t do that - the UK is a member state, so free movement of goods and so on ...” but then ?
You ll be out - no need (and no way) for the EU to force a member state to do something for a non member state
That’s not hostility
That’s just politics
And it was totally clear that it would end like this in the case of Brexit
No that would be hostility - as the UK would interfere in the internal politics of another country - the same as if Spain would help Scotland to gain independence for example (which it doesn’t do)
Gibraltar on the other hand will be non EU territory and thus can be treated as such in any way
It’s basically on the same level as Any other non EU country with no special treatment to be expected
Again : what did you expect ?
And try to find a clear concise answer to that
How should the EU treat the UK and it’s dependencies after Brexit ?
Ah you see but Irish unification is on the table due to the Good Friday agreement
And no member state wants some sort of civil war in or near a member state
And since it involves a member state macron can say something - it will in the end affect all of the EU if we have to deal with the north Irish after all
If handing over Gibraltar ever comes on the table be sure that the rest of the EU will also have an opinion about that
But you still haven’t answered my question - what exactly did you expect from the EU in case of Brexit ?
You still haven’t answered my question :
What did you expect in case of Brexit ?
And as for macron :
He said that “Irish unification would solve Brexit problems - but it’s not up to France”
If you call someone saying “hey there is a problem here that can be solved like this, but in the end it’s up to you” jingoism well - then everything is jingoism as soon as someone dares to say anything that doesn’t fall in line with UK wishes
If he had said “we want Irish unification cause it’s the only solution and we don’t care about the UK at all” well yes then I would agree - but he didn’t.
He basically said “find a solution - even if it’s one that’s out of your comfort zone”
Again - what did you expect ?
Can you answer that ? Or is there noting ?
Why would an independent Britain be in any way interested what Spain does in a purely internal conflict between Catalonia and the Spanish government ?
I hope that you can see the difference between France telling the UK and Ireland to fix a problem cause it will affect a member state and Britain telling Spain to fix a problem In which it has no discernible interest at all
And in fact Johnson had an opinion about the referendum it was (and I quote) : “The Catalonian referendum is a matter for the Spanish govt & people
Imp that Spanish constitution respected & the rule of law upheld
“ so he basically said what I said -> it’s an internal Spanish matter which does not affect anyone else and had to be solved there
The Irish question affects the whole of the EU though
I hope yoh can see the difference (I start to doubt it though)
And again :
What did you expect as the reaction from the EU to the Brexit referendum ? Did you have the hope for preferential treatment ? All at the same ? Just with no freedom of movement ? Where you that oblivious ?
>	The weakening of Spain and the distraction of Spain from Gibraltar via the Catalonian question would absolutely be of British interest in regard to Gibraltar
Of course
That’s so ridiculous even you had to laugh at that argument right ?
>	So Johnson did the exact opposite of what Macron did
How is this contributing to your point
Again - Irland is Part of the EU, France is Part of the EU, as such France is interested in a positive outcome of Brexit for Ireland
Which includes no violence in NI due to the possibility of a hard border between NI and the Republic
You might not like that - but that’s how it is
Johnson on the other hand has no interest other then sow discord in Spain if he supports the Catalonian separatists
If the UK would still be a member of the EU things might be different - but when the referendum was held article 50 was already triggered
And it was clear that the UK would leave
Plus support for Catalonian independence would probably give Scottish independence also rise - and I guess you don’t want that
And are you finally able or willing to Answer my questions ?
Nobody is advocating for the break up of the UK - or for a blockade of Gibraltar
But at the same time - if it’s happening ? Why should the EU care
The food Friday agreement includes the option of a border poll - maybe it is a good time to invoke that and figure out if NI wants to be united with the republic
And no such a clause or agreeing does not exist in Catalonia - so don’t even try to argue with that
And as for Gibraltar ? It’s not of the EUs concern anymore to be honest
Or only as far as it has to be - so if there is again an open sky agreement the EU will force Spain to open its airspace for 1st freedom flights to Gibraltar but if it doesn’t exist ? How should the EU enforce someting that doesn’t exist
Also there is no treaty that says “the land border between Gibraltar and Spain must be open in case of the UK not being part of the EU” - as it doesn’t exist - it can’t be enforced
This is not jingoism - this is just political reality
And the reality is that an unimportant island nation of 60 million can’t make demands to the European Union
Britannia doesn’t rule the seas anymore
Face reality at some point
And no - you still didn’t say what you expect from Brexit - you are just hiding behind pretending that the EU is the big bad wolf who wants to dismantle the UK
I am really interested how you imagine how the EU - UK relations should look like a year or two down the road
I don't know if this counts as stupid or horrible, but here it goes:
Our former Secretary of Interior said that he wants to concentrate Asylum Seekers in camps
He didn't understand why so many people had a problem with that wording
Ex Vice chancellor took a quite incriminating vacation in Ibiza
Isnt the reason for cannabis beeing prohibited that its illegal
Well there's the Ibizia-Video, literally everything in there qualifies
This one is not as stupid but still really dumb: After the 2019 parliamentary election, the leader of the Social Democrats (who just received their worst result in a federal election ever) triumphantly proclaimed that her party is going in the right direction
Have you ever heard about the bsoffene gschicht were politician tried to sell our water and other stuff
Also please look at the toes of this russian oligarch ;)
Austria's present chancellor Sebastian Kurz said:
"If they can't afford to pay rent, they should buy a flat
A candidate for a small, local election had a steam account linked to his email where he played with nicknames as "Heinrich Gaserboy himmler" or "Adolf Hitler", used Himmler as his profile picture and was active in a steam group called Panzer division 57
He claimed some leftists created the account to get him negative press for the election
The account was years old
He also said something about politics being above the law but I can't remember what he said exactly though
Were these state companies relics from the Salazar era
Y'all need to introduce a height requirement for immigration from Austria
He's really short and overcompensates for it constantly
No, but actually he has 4 discontinued university careers (history, philosophy, journalism and political sciences) and he likes horses (instead of German shepherds)
Das Recht muss der Politik folgen (the law must follow politics)
It was at a discussion about denying the status of protection to deliquent/criminal asylum seekers/refugees
It isn't that hard believe when you know what he normal says or does
Also, drunk and stupid added together, always guarantees a good outcome
IIRC there were some vandalism edits on his wikipedia page shortly before they announced the ban, including the cockroach one
So people were like "the real reason surely was the cockroach, not the YPG
Why sell profitable companies
The price doesn't seem to have been worth it
He probably wasn't anything much out of the ordinary
I haven't looked it up, but from memory, he looks average-sized in pictures
It's a classic tactic of defamation against your enemy though, make him seem smaller than he actually is to the point of ridicule
Probably a mixture of both
Aren't they Social Democrats
But weren't they those that profited from the Carmation (?) revolution
It's kinda ironic that there didn't seem to be have been any large-scale corruption scandals under Salazar (at least non that were uncovered after the revolution, which is strange) but after a few years under democratic government the first large corruption scandal happened
>I mean, corruption is inherent to an autocracy / dictatorship, so that's why corruption scandals didn't exist / uncovered, because things simply weren't recorded or if they were, it wouldn't matter
But yeah, embezzlers are also a risk that the people need to watch out for
Corruption is corruption, it doesn't matter if it is within a democracy or autocracy, republic or monarchy
Corruption also isn't invisible, at least in the long term
If there was large scale corruption you would notice it in practical ways like budgets drying up on the way to the ground, construction costs increasing tons over budget, huge nonsensical construction jobs or just loss of tax money before it reaches the treasury
In the case of revolutions corruption generally sees the light of days because old data is found, analysed and published
We see this constantly in regime changes
We see it in Spain with Franco, Latin America, Africa, Russia and even China
In the case of Salazar however there is a stark absence of evidence for corruption linked to him
Ski resorts probably
Honestly, quite a lot of what has happend the last few days was pretty unthinkable a few weeks ago
* Church/Religious service
Cancelled
* Going to work unless it's absolutely necessary
Cancelled
* Ski resorts
Closed (some waaaayy to late, sadly - Sorry, Iceland, Norway, Germany and probably rest of Northern Europe)
* Alpine Skiing World Cup
Cancelled
* Soccer season
Cancelled
* Bars/Restaurants
Closed
* Drafting civil service conscripts (people who didn't want to do military service for moral reasons)
Is already starting to happen
It's quite surreal all this - but at least we all feel like we're doing something
The truly unthinkable thing would be if the trafiken closed and people couldn't buy smokes anymore
I can't imagine it
If it is we'll all be dead before the approval process is through
I heard about it
Both sides are responsible
Especially the that town wich didn't give a damn that they actually are near the Italian border
Unless you live in Tirol
Then walks and hikes are also banned
Unless you have a dog
Aren't the danes uo there with the austrians when it comes to winter sports and skiing
I'm pretty sure that when you compare it to population those two have the best gold metal count for the winter olympics
Yeah, I thought about Norway not Denmark
not really forgetting about it, it’s merely slipping my mind bc I barely have to think about it
what I do admire though, is their low level of racism even though they are all by „themselves“ up there, correct me if i’m wrong
the rest of the european countries, at least I got the impression, developed a relative high level of it over the last couple years, even though they constantly have to deal with neighboring countries, work migration, and so on
one might think, this should sensitivize a population in regard to other nationalities, but it doesn’t.
meanwhile, iceland offers to take in refugees and no one listens
smh
No because Iceland was my favorite country for a long time
If it was up to me I'd make Vienna the connecting station
I think we have a lot more international connections to western Europe than Budapest
As someone else said, I'd be wary of the money being abused but the project itself I'd support
East and southeast Europe needs better train networks
>high speed rail is a staple in Western and increasingly - Central Europe
Good one
It certainly is good for some western cities and probably better than in the east but holy crap could it be better here too
I'm travelling every once in a while between vienna and stuttgart
It wouldn't be impossible to make this rail connection work, and still going by car is cheaper and faster than going by train
So yes, I'm all for improving our high speed rails or really just making some in the first place
As the top poster said, "staple" is wrong
&#x200B;
Not sure if you count Austria to West or Central, but:
there are about 200km between the two largest cities in Austria, the trains takes at least 2:35 => Car usually faster (speed limit on highways is 130 km/h.)
Going further south to Klagenfurt, 135km more, is at least 2:54h more
&#x200B;
There are some rail sections where 200+ km/h is possible, and some are in construction, but still there are many things that can be done
And given the amount of travellers, probably the inner-country rails are more important than a connection to Greece
Any reason why it would specifically be Bulgaria and Greece
In my eyes such a high speed network (which I absolutely support) should evenly connect all countries of the Union
And right now the whole eastern countries are in a really bad shape in that regard
I'm totally in the mentality for taking trains of flights but if trains are a lot more expensive, I need to make multiple changes and it takes like 16h instead of 2h, makes kinda difficult
(You can get a flair on the right; also your username definitely checks out)
Also, the connection Vienna-Triest
There should be old tracks still
But that's an extra train change which in my opinion is one of the most annoying things of travelling
> Because these two have the furthest from being connected
*looks at Finland* are you even for real, mate
Still not something I would consider quality time
I try to but usually I don't find a lot of Austrian comments
Our country is too smol :(
Maybe it's because I'm biased but I do tend to find a lot of Austrian comments
I think we're a little overrepresented (like, more comments than our size suggests) in the European subreddits
For each Austrian commenting there should be like 10 Germans and 8 French people
Then maybe I'm just not looking hard enough lol
Hello little one :3
Yes
And the biggest problem in my opinion is that Africa is often seen as one country, one culture, which has been stated several times by other people in the comments
One of the main reasons (I think) is that besides those ads the only time anyone talks about Africa is when there is something terrible on the news
Even in school the only time the whole continent was talked about was 1) when the "Out of Africa" theory came up in biology class and 2) when history class taught us about colonialism
Which wasn't really helpful because sadly the way that subject was taught was very disappointing
I think what opened my eyes was seeing people like Trevor Noah on YouTube, talking about his country South Africa, while simultaneously starting to look up countries all over the world so I could find rather unusual destinations for travelling
I started to realize that I actually never questioned what I was shown until that point and I see things very differently now
But the way the usual media and even school portrays Africa is basically that: A bunch of starving kids, Ebola, savages, war zones, etc
So since people want to stay away from that nobody even cares to find out more about individual countries
TL;DR: Starving kids, Ebola, war zones, savages - portrayal of Africa in a nutshell here
No education at all, just sad ads for charity
I mean, I personally don't really watch TV, but I think in Austrian media and by Austrian NGOs these ads have been replaced with less stereotype-y ones in the last five years at least
Reminds me a bit of an Austrian film from the early 90s. It's a mockumentary where a group of anthropologists/ethnologists from sub-saharan Africa go to Upper Austria to study the culture and of the natives
It does a pretty great job mimicking the condescending tone many of the real documentaries can't seem to avoid
Funnily Austria has a huge percentage of donations to NGOs by individual people when compared to other European countries
But we all are like "nah Austrians aren't generous at all".
It's called Das Fest des Huhnes (Festival of the Chicken)
Check out [my reply] to Worldgnasher
Lollygagging
Not a word, but an idiom: "To give up the ghost
" It's literally the same in German: "Den Geist aufgeben
" When I first heard it in English, I thought this must be a very sloppy translation
Sea-moose is kind of better than shame-us
trödeln/herumtrödeln I  guess comes closest
Because Schwarzi just doesn't have the same ring to it
Nope, never have, never will
Last catalogue of a nordic company I got emotional about was the 1990 Lego catalogue
I'll miss it, really
I always kept the most recent issue in the toilet reading shelf
What I find really irritating is people running around in deep winter clothes when it's like 15°C outside
Edit: typo
I miss being able to go skiing on 2m of natural snow
You know what
I received a wish
at ad with christmas stuff in JULY
15°C is the funniest temperature, because some guys will still be wearing shorts and some guys will already wear winter coats lol
I am actually kinda happy that leather jacket time gets longer lol
I'm one of them
Since when are people only allowed to get irritated by stuff that affects them
It looks beautiful for a day and then it just sucks
If you aren't an avid skier there is nothing about snow to like
If you have a house with a yard you will have to shovel every day before work which can mean getting up at 4am, shovel the fucking snow, then take a shower and go to work
Then be stuck in traffic for an eternity because snow causes a chaos on the streets
Then after work shovel snow from your car and be stuck in traffic again
Then come home and shovel your yard again
If you live on a hill or mountain you can add getting stuck in snow every now and then
Its not always that bad of course
But sometimes snow can really really really ruin your day
Heck I know a guy who does that through winter
"Warm" meaning appropriate for north pole expeditions
Because that's quite literally what some people seem to wear
I remember once getting stuck in a one-way street because there was like more than 1m of snow infront of us
Also snow in cities becomes dirty and ugly really fast
You should really check your circulation if that's the case
Don't do sports either, but am always warm from my childhood days
Humans as a apecies are weird
Is Anti-German sentiment still a thing in your country
I am myself mo German, but native German speaker, and I often encountered people who tend to be quite hostile against Germans
Also some Slavic friends of mine, arguing that Germans are oppressive and expansive by nature and very rude, unfriendly and humor-less (I fall out of the scheme according to them) although my experience with Germans is very different and I also know that history is far more complex
But often I met many people who still have the WWII image of Germans although a ton has changed the last 70 years
How deep does this still run in Europe
I feel like Austrian dislike of Germans can often be explained by classic neighbour rivalry, that is we are more similar than we feel comfortable with
We still have those sirens
They are tested in case of a nuclear or natural catastrophe or in case of war
Those sirens are also used in shorter intervalls to alert the fire brigade in the country side (rural fire brigades are usually voluntary forces)
>Poles don’t really mind Austrians because we are taught that the Austrian partition was fairly chill on us and if we paid taxes you didn’t minded us either
So there isn’t any Anti-Austrian sentiment
Thatś nice to hear
It was like an unspoken deal
You get to oppress the Ukrainians, we won't try to assimilate anyone and you'll support us in return
Except for that last sentence you could apply this whole paragraph to Austria and it would be 100% true
I can relate to that
My sister in law is Turkish, and she really likes German/Austrian culture
Well we Austrians are the median of this: "Austrians have rules like the Germans and break them like the Italians" is a running joke even among us
Maybe this has also something to do with the historical connection between Styria, Carinthia and Northern Slovenia
We should not forget that e.g. Styria was a country of mixed ethnicities for centuries
A friend of mine is also from northern Slovenia and he said his grandfather was German speaker
So he had also a more positive connection
From my experience this has a lot to do with the level of education
I know several Turks in Austria and Germany, including my sister-in-law who is an engineer, and they all appreciate our countries and culture
A fellow PhD
student of mine is second generation Turk and really identifies as a German
If it wouldn't be for his name, you would never guess he is of Turkish heritage
German-Turkish comedian Serdar Somuncu made a lot of good stand up comedy sketches also pointing this out
They never do
Very edgelordy indeed
*Electric guitars wailing in the distance*
Can you hear it
I think *they* have arrived
They are up that mountain side
Funny that you bring this up, I found a YouTube video about exactly that topic yesterday: [
There were multiple plans for that before WW1, support by the heir to the empire, no less
There's a theory that this is the true reason the archduke was murdered in Sarajevo
The Black Hand was afraid that a Serbian constituent country of a federation wouldn't have any interest in joining Serbia anymore
Or even worse, a united South Slavic constituent country that could claim dominion over them in the future
Sorry, but this is an oversimplification
Already famous author Grillparzer said in the 19th century "I am Austrian not a German". Historically speaking you had 2 train of thoughts: The German nationalists which considered themselves German and wanted to join the German Reich and Austrian-Germans which saw themselves distinct from the Germans and saw themselves as one of the many ethnicity in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire
There is a stark contrast between German as ethnicity and as a nation and back in the days the words were used almost exchangeable, which is still hurting Austria today
The Bavarians also don't really identify as German
They still are very keen on their privilege of being an independent state with the German Federation having their own constitution etc
And I don't start here with the Swiss
Regarding wars: I don't have a complete list, but we fought several wars against Bavaria also
The reason Hitler identified himself as German and not Austrian was that he lived in one of the border regions we obtained from the Bavarians just 50 years before his birth
Speaking of which: Yes the victim myth after WWII played a factor but more reasons to identify as Austrian was the fact that Germany didn't acknowledge Austria as it's own country
It was renamed Ostmark with the reasoning it is a made up country
There were around 30
000 non-jewish Austrians who lost their life in active resisttance against the Nazis and our first cancellors were send to concentration camps or had to flee the country
Also the reason why German-Nationalism was so popular after WWI was that Austria's economy was basically busted
It was less about ideology in the beginning
Richard Löwental said summed it up perfectly: "The Austrians wanted to become Germans, till they became Germans"
History is often more nuanced than people make it up to be, you know ...
Actually I quite know what you mean, it's just that from my experience it's mostly uneducated folks
You can observe similar trends from our own people who want "the strong man" running the country but mostly are uneducated
I guess a lot of people think that Red Bull is American, not Austrian
My father still thinks his beloved Seiko watches are a German brand, with their 'great unmatched German engineering'.
&#x200B;
I won't burst his bubble by telling him that Seiko is actually Japanese
Milka is German, as a kid I thought it is Austrian
(I think nowadays it's neither and owned by some international food conglomerate)
That the "Wiener schnitzel" is from germany and not from austria
Not sure how many of you actively know of it, but Bitdefender, the antivirus brand, is Romanian
Have been using it for a long time and thought it was American
Their new logo is even supposed to represent the battle ensign of the ancient Dacian people who used to live in what is now Romania
And many Austrians think Frucade is Austrian, not German
Jeez guys, I really just meant to say that the COMPANY Red Bull is Austrian
It is believed that the first beers were brewed by Mesopotamians, yet we can agree that Heineken for example is Dutch
it's a brand made by ferrero specifically for the german-speaking market, and after being successful, exported it to other markets
Ferror is italian but the german branch of it made Kinder
I mean, you weren't entirely wrong
The recipe is Austrian, and the Loacker family originally hails from Vorarlberg
Also, they produce their wafers in both countries, namely in South Tyrol (Alto Adige) and East Tyrol
Well you were partly right on Opel and Braun
They are both German companies that at some point (Opel in 1929, Braun in 1967) have been bought by American corporations (GE and Gilette)
That still makes them German companies in my opinion
Edit: GE to GM
Actually it's from Milan though
God bless the Austro-Hungarian Empire
I mean it's bavarian so we have quite a good claim on it
I just learned this the other day and i have not yet fully recovered
Are you expecting a list of names, or what
No without Mateschitz nobody would know of RedBull as a drink
Yes he does
&#x200B;
Seiko, founded 1891 in Heidelberg by Hans-Friedrich Seiko
I mean if I wouldn't know it better, that would sound plausible to me tbh
i always thought it was austrian, and it literally translates to "save your money" (i didnt think it was german bcs it doesnt really exist in germany)
Shows you what luxury car brand is the most successful in branding
[From me] funnily enough ;)
Me too
It was also very disappointing as a ten-year-old who spoke little English and no French
No chatting with the Princesses
I always thought it was Italian tbh, because their selection of goods seems very italocentric
Puma is the German word for cougar
Not west but south and north
The world in Austria is too small :D
Well, nonetheless without him his Thai friend would still sale his version of RedBull in Thailand
Wait, did the princesses in the park not speak French
Puma is also the Quechua word for cougar
But they didn't completely
There was(I think it doesn't exist anymore) a product line for italian food that was called de spar
Apparently the word [is of Quechua origin] so yes
I mean there are several countries without universal healthcare on this planet
92% do though
Countries without are:
- Somalia
- Mauretania
- Senegal
- Gambia
- Mali
- Liberia
- Angola
- Mozambique
- Tanzania
- Iraq
- Jordan
- Lebanon
- Turkmenistan
- Afghanistan
- Suriname
- Indonesia
- Cambodia
- United States
(I forgot some in Africa I think)
So how are we even talking about this
Of course it is working out
It always baffles me, that so many US people rant about it
It is in almost every aspect a good idea
This topic is the number one example of the greed of the wealthiest
The capitalistic system is working well in the modern world, but it needs its governmental regulations protecting the basic human needs
For a start: in a democratic country, the government works for the people
And EVERYBODY needs water, food, and safety
Without those factors, people become criminal
A country should try to avoid this for all costs, because it is way more expensive to deal with result
Its ok to let people pay for certain treatments, but the USA has taken not one but many steps into the wrong directions
I think it should be embarrassing for such a developed and rich country as the USA, not to have healthcare
Its working well
Its a system made by humans, run by humans, so of course it has its flaws
But overall I have very few complains, and it is definitely preferable to the alternative
Its of course something you'll find on your salary
as in, the money you pump into the system every month
Solidarity ain't cheap if you don't need it
However, once you need it, its a lifesaver without question
My wife's grandfather spent the last month in intensive care
He had emergency surgery six times
Now he's better
Just imagine if someone would have to pay, even if just a part of it
That would be many hundreds of thousands
Yes, public health Care is a good idea
Just an example: when I was 14 (19 now) I had a severe skiing accident where I injured my head
I had to be flown to hospital by helicopter and then stayed there for quite some time
When I got home the only bills I got were from the vending machines at the hospital, and the helicopter company (which I forwarded to my insurance and they paid it)
Now, both of my parents are in management positions, and our total household income at that time was around 11k/month pretax (~6500€/month post tax+healthcare)
My parents paid around 450€/month combined for healthcare
The helicopter bill was the only one I ever saw, and it was ~3500€, assuming a price of 500€/day(I know it's probably to low) the hospital would have cost me another ~7500€ (probably closer to 10k)
And because I was under 18 my parents didn't have to pay any deductibles
Is it common to drink tap water in your country
I do have friends from other European countries, and when I visited them, I was surprised that often they offered me still water from bottles that they bought in the supermarket
Upon asking why they wouldn't use the water from the water pipe, they were a bit confused
Here in Austria almost nobody would think of buying still water in the supermarket except if you need it on your way
Despite my research about high water quality in Europe, it seems that some don't trust their tap water
or are there other reasons
The only time people buy bottled water is when they want to have sparkling water
Tap water is as clean as can be
How often does it happen that there is a boiled water notice
I've never heard of that happening in Austria, if you are connected to water service
Edit: apparently it happens more often than I expected but hardly anybody talks about it
I'm a student in civil engineering specialised in drinking and sewage water, and I've only learned about the theoretical procedures if you find contaminants and not from real scenarios
Is the tap water in London drinkable
When I was there the first time with my school, my teacher told us not to drink it
That was in 2005
I've never heard of Brita; what's it for
There are some regions where more people use an extra in line filter
As far as I know that is due to high iron or nitrate content or high water hardness, all within quality standards though
There was a research that these filters often worsen the quality since the filters are not set up properly or not maintained regularly
I've never seen a refrigerator with a water dispenser
Temperature is a quality standard as well
I think the highest temperature is around 12°C, in Vienna depending on where you live it can be down to 7°C. For some towns it was even a reason to change their water source because temperature was to high
Not common at all
Most people would be worried that stagnant water in the fridge-pipes would be unsafe, and water comes with perfect drinking-temperature from the tab anyway
Thankfully we don't have a chlorine taste in our water that would make filtering necessary
If you slap enough money on it, everything can be made the best
Wow
Just wow
Then again, that could be a local story
>I've never heard of that happening in Austria, if you are connected to water service
Sure does happen
Not all water services use chlorine all of the time and bacteria exists everywhere
There had been a warning about half a year ago in Steyr, because they found bacteria somewhere within the system
People were advicd to boil the water before use
But that was due to some polution from a damage
What's more common here is that some kind of stuff was found in the water that makes it unfit for consumption, most of the time a higher concentration of some mineral rather than some sort of bacteria
I bought Voss water once - for the bottle
The best tap water I ever had was somewhere in the Scottish highlands
And I'm spoilt, here in Vienna we get spring water directly from the alps
My parents home has such high limestone values that it's off the grid of the mile washing machine support sheet
Lol
Though now that the village has grown bigger they had to add more springs and some of them have really low limestone values
Now they are mixing them so their water has normalised
Gotta add though: the original spring was directly under a place where the locals used to mine limestone
So no surprise it was that limestone heavy
I've never heard of chlorine or uv desinfection failing in Austria
My teacher said something about too much chlorine
And after the off putting chlorine smell during my first shower there I didn't dare to drink it anymore
The shower smelled like a swimming pool
Many small springs don't need/have constant desinfection
It can happen, that specific bacteria concentrations get too high every once in a while
Then you'll be notified by your water provider and they are obliged to fix the problem as soon as possible
It only happens in very rare cases like a huge flood
In Dublin I had the worst tap water ever,
if I lived there I would go for bottled water too
The city itself is great though
I live in a place with non chlorinated water and we had one time about 3-4 years ago when our water was not safe for consumption
interesting, we were in the area around Drumcondra
is that the good or bad side
All the time
At this point I can speak English better than German and usually use Denglisch (German + English) when texting or speaking
Sometimes I also ask my friends „what‘s ..... in german
oh yeah happens all the time
I'd say it happens most often with specific words where somehow the english equivalent just fits the intended connotation better
and sometimes, there's just no single word to easily express the same nuance, or it does, but gives a different *feeling*. words like *cringe* or *awkward* come to mind, anybody else can think of more of those
same in German tbh
while there *is* a word with the same meaning, we're just not going around as much declaring our exitedness about things
looking forward to sth
yeah
can't wait
yes
but that doesn't make us giddy and loud and *excited*, I guess
interestingly, the same also is true in the other direction
for example, I've often missed a direct english equivalent for being *gespannt* ("anxious to find out sth")
again, of course you can express the same meaning, but it's kinda clunky and just doesn't feel the same
Austo-*what*
We speak in our own dialect that‘s from the region each of us is from, if you want to know that
We learn both Austrian Standard German and German Standard German in school
Every federal state (we have 9) has it‘s own main dialect Austrians usually can pick out right away, kinda like in the US where every state has it‘s own kind of english dialect
And some federal states have more main dialects (eg Styria has normal Styrian, Altsteirisch (Old-sytrian) and Stursteirisch (a very weird form of styrian that‘s well known but not widely understood))
Overall we have many dialects, I looked up how many and according to YouTube videos too many to even count them
I hope that answered your question, if not, feel free to ask again
I don‘t understand the sentence
What do you mean by „Austria is the balkans of the german world“? Do you mean language wise we have a whole ass other language nobody understands
Because that‘s Switzerland ngl
And overall, sorry to say this, but around here the balkans have the stereotype of being quite poor and asocial ("shitty") people, and yes I know that‘s not true and a stupid stereotype but Austria definitely doesn‘t have that stereotype, if you mean this
Sorry I really don‘t really understand what any of that means /:
Putting sauce on your Schnitzel is considered a hate crime in Austria
The usual, as with most countries:
- Calling us [bigger, neighbouring nationality or people group that speaks the same or a similar language]
(Seriously, we are not Germans
Yes, we all know, we would have been considered as such 100 years ago, but it is in fact not 100 years ago
Believe us, if we say that we are not Germans, we mean that, and we know the history behind it
Don't try to teach us as to why we are acktually "ethnically" or "genetically" or whatever, Germans
Not only is that incorrect, but you'll look and sound like a fool
- Doing [certain taboo gesture] or expressing favourable views towards [historical totalitarian or autocratic regime, which is viewed very negatively nowadays]
(Seriously, don't do the Hitler salute here, it's not edgy, but only incredibly shitty
Also it's not only incredibly unfunny and unoriginal, but also incredibly illegal
And you might get punched in the face, and you would deserve it
- Eating [national food] wrong
Posing with/popping the Nazi salute "for fun" or for a picture
Should be common sense, but I've seen wayyy to many tourists doing this
You'll either get fined or beat up
You definitely shouldn't ask someone what they are earning
Schnitzel with any kind of sauce
/r/SchnitzelVerbrechen
Pouring sauce on a crisp and delicious Schnitzel
If you dare pour any kind of sauce onto Schnitzel or say Austria = Germany (we love our German neighbors, but the whole world thinks we‘re German just because our official language is German, so please refrain from that), consider yourself crucified
Especially the first one
~~Who pours sauce onto Schnitzel~~
But isn't that normal everywhere
I always greet when I enter a smaller store, it's kind of comman courtesy, no
I'm convinced the reason kurz is so hated by so many people is because he has still not made it legal to execute everyone being caught consuming, distributing or producing schnitzel with sauce without trial
"Schnitzel mit Tunke". Never an easier way to spot a German
I actually think that lynching such a person wouldn´t even be punished by courts here
Köln, Düsseldorf
all the same
:D Even their beer
Well, let's talk about Kosovo then
We have the same tradition, but I didn't know it was reserved for the dead
So does one bring *only* an even number of flowers to funerals
We also have that rule with the uneven numbers
Except for half a dozen and a dozen, those are ok
But I have no idea why it is this way
also, standing on the left side of escalators
recommended if you want to find out how passive-aggressive we can be
Hopefully both
> putting parmesan on fish or fish-based sauce
Who even would do such a thing
get a better country name then that doesn't consist of abreviations
can't really say "british" either because that will or won't correctly include some island
same reason why everybody just calls people from "the US" americans
Exactly my thoughts
I'd never enter a smaller store without greeting, it's rude
Damn, the correct answer either way is always "Wow, even better
"...
That's a dip, you can have that
They're referring to a sauce covering the schnitzel
Look up pictures od "Schnitzel in Tunke" to see what the crime is supposed to look like
> But why do i get the berry sauce with my wienerschnitzel
Because you frequent the wrong restaurants I guess
Here in Vienna, cranberry sauce is for tourists, or peasants
Hate crime
Used ketchup
As opposed to new ketchup
Ketchup and so on are okay
OP means a really liquid sauce, stuff you'd also have on a roast or smth
After she leaves primary school, maybe her taste changes
In Austria, you can have a bit of cranberry sauce with it
Do they call it Schnitzel or try to make a dish containing one
I mean, they even electrocute their breadcrumbs, not sure what kind of hate the have toward this type of food
better not mess with them
tonkatsu ≠ schnitzel
japanese are guilty of their own food crimes towards pizza, but I guess they get a free pass for the way the world has been raping the concept of sushi
First one yes, second one: NO
It's supposed to be dry
Well not dry as a desert, but Schnitzel usually should be juicy enough without liquid on top of it
Adding a bit of lemon juice or cowberries, or even ketchup is fine tho
Simple: You don't have a dry schnitzel
UwU, step-German what are you doing
Every time, man
wondering now if the same is true for you as it is for me: it helps with the shame to take extra big steps so your feet aren't touching the ground in as many places
Or "Lügenpresse" (lying press), "Systemmedien" (mainstream media), "Ostküsten-Eliten" (east coast financial elites), "kulturelle Marxisten" (cultural marxists), or "[insert well-known Jewish businessman]" (nowadays usually George Soros), which is all good old Nazi-slang, directly from the 1930s, all dogwhistling towards "tha Jeeeews".
> Also I heard it was the first country to become independent
The first independent from who
This makes no sense
So they are kinda like the French
People seem to not understand that Germany/Austria/Switzerland's borders **to each other** have been the ones that have been there the longest
North Slovenia <3
I give NAWAFL (northen austria with a funny language) the approval to call the northern part of the kingdom of hungary upper hungary
You are also allowed to use the names:
Southern carinthia (slovenia)
The land people go to if they want a cheaper italy holiday (croatia)
Greater burgenland (hungary)
Totally austrian (south tyrol)
German austria (old bavaria)
Problemmaker (bosnia and herzegovina)
For its respective regions
Best case scenario
Lingonberry jam is acceptable though, and goes fantastic with Schnitzel
There's several foreign journalists with double nationality in Turkish prisons
Catalán is like a middle thing between Spanish an Occitan
It's spoken as a first language by a majority of Catalans
If you know Spanish, you'll have an easy time understanding it on a basic level
Look:
> La vaca, en el caso de la hembra; o toro, en el caso del macho (Bos primigenius taurus), es un mamífero artiodáctilo de la familia de los bóvidos
> La vaca, en el cas de la hembra; o toro, en el cas del mascle (Bos primigenius taurus), és un mamífer artiodàctil de la família dels bóvidos
Bad schnitzel isnt allowed its a hate crime
I would call the sauce (or in good old Austrian "Schmier") just gravy
And of course it's a crime to put it on Schnitzel
Nah, it shouldnt be dry
The breading should be crispy, the inside soft and Tender
> Romansh is an official language in Switzerland, and it is only spoken here
However Ladino is also spoken in South Tyrol / northern Italy, and apparently it's closely related
No idea what that user meant with "first independent country". Independent from who
Except for the non-existing tripoint border, ironically
There's definitely far more than only 25 languages spoken within the EU
There's 24 *official EU languages* alone (and Catalan isn't one of them), so including all the official and unofficial minority languages it is certainly closer to 40-50
The 24 official EU languages (i.e. the EU publishes its laws and stuff in those languages, and MEPs hold speeches in those languages) are: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish*, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish
^(*Irish is not an official "working language" of the European parliament, for practical reasons
I.e. they don't have enough qualitfied translators)
Minority languages are among others: Albanian, Sorbian, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Sardinian, Corsican, Occitan, Breton, Basque, Catalan/Valencian, Galician, several Sami languages, Luxembourgish, Turkish, Arabic, several Romani languages, Russian, Yiddish, several Sign languages, as well as several immigrant languages such as Hindustani, Chinese, Tamil, Vietnamese, and several other unofficial or unrecognized minority languages with very small speaker communities, such as Irish Traveller Cant, , Judaeo-Spanish
I never had problems with the so-called "rude Parisians" either
> When an Austrian says Schnitzel it's breaded
We also have unbreaded Schnitzel
Usually called "Naturschnitzel". The unbreaded ones usually have a sauce
Bad Schnitzel sounds like a Kurort
you put a bit of jam on each bite of your schnitzel with your knife
> near innsbruck
Well, here you go :D
Lol sorry, now I get it - I was really confused for a moment, if you guys would re-use condiments or something :D
Yeah, sorry, that's what I meant
Hiking is different
I think in most countries, people greet each other when hiking (unless it's a very popular and crowded hike)
Obviously it depends on the context
But if a European far-right politician talks about "secret circles of east coast elites who control mass immigration" or something like that, that usually an anitsemitic dogwhistle in the tradition of the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion". Same goes for George Soros
He may be a liberal capitalist exploitative businnessman and you can definitely criticize him for that
But when people like Orban stylize him to be the devil incarnate, that definitely has some anti-semitic undertones
Soros is made the culprit for all kinds of invented bullshit on the far right
It all goes in the same direction of "the international Jewry is out for 'us' [i.e. white Europeans or whatever]".
In the case of the "mainstream media", I meant more the particular German terms of "Lügenpresse", which implies that the press as a whole always is lying, and "Systemmedien", i.e. all the media is part of some kind of "system", which is of course controlled by "the international east coast elites" aaaand whoopsie, here we are again
Our very own super-Aryan, not-at-all-corrupt, and certainly-not-Nazis-I-swear-that's-just-isolated-cases-I-promise-my-right-arm-just-has-this-tick right wing knights of the Austrian Freedom Party *love* to use terms like that
Those terms are not openly and easily recognizable Nazi-terms, but the people who are supposed to know what is meant, know what is meant
I.e. dogwhistles
My girlfriend always tells me within Spain Catalans are famous for being ratas, moneywise
I can see where that comes from XD
Well then that's definitely not true
Rome was a republic, San Marino is thr oldest still existing republic etc
So the austro-bavarian dialekts get recognized as slavic dialekts and slovakia, czechia and poland are now north slavs instead of westslavs so that austria can become a westslavic nation
Already been there
Haven't had any Schnitzel though
Haha ja wirklich
griaß eich
that's work camp for the three generations of your family
>I'm by no means a historian, but I'm pretty sure both Romansh and Ladino developed from the spoken Latin used during the time of the Roman Empire
Yes
It's either that or they are Italic sister languages of Latin who have had heavy Latin influences over two millenia
Which one it really is, is impossible to say
> the other UK languages do
> EU languages
Nah keeping English makes sense
It's the most common second language in the EU, it's spoken natively in Ireland and Malta (and potentially hopefully soon Scotland again)
There's no need to "remove" anything, because there's no maximum of EU languages
That would be kinda dumb
Irish mostly has its status bc it's *the* national language of all Ireland (Republic of), and I guess the Irish really insisted on it (Luxembourgish is – next to Turkish, but that's another story – the only national language that is not an official EU language)
Whereas Catalan is "merely" a regional language
In its own twisted way it somehow makes sense
Thanks to Madrid's language policies
But hey, in that regard Spain is still better than France, which may be hard to believe, but is a fact
For people from Vienna there's only "the city" and "the countryside". Since Innsbruck is not in Vienna, it therefor must be countryside and that clearly means the peasantry inhabits that place
Well, let's put it this way - it's not Vienna :)
I can empathize, Austrians are also ratas, we always pay separate, and turns around every cent 3 times before spending it
[Austro-Bavarian German and Swiss German]
That the super-thicc couscous right
If by "originating from Israel", you mean the country Israel which was founded in 1948, I guess, yeah ... idk
But generally, Levantine cuisine has some great shit
Yeah, some day, when all this shit is over, we will travel again
Vienna is a great place overall, and also has a very rich Jewish history
A lot of Israeli visitors come here because of that
my country comes in last in FTTH (fiber to the house)
so basically it’s fibercables to the building door and then it’s „screw you, we will lay copper wires to your appartement, because it’s fun“
Sad Schnitzel noises
If even
FTTB would be a massive improvement
Many are now getting FTTCB (curb = for a whole neighborhood) or, if worst comes to worst, no fiber cable up to the exchange (0
5 to 2km of copper)
Also our success rate for world wars we started
Thankfully
So u in anarchy
from your username I guess you’re spanish
maybe add flair, so these questions don’t occur :)
Here we have a croatian dialekt that is considered a minority language but nether serbian nor croatian is considered one even though we have way more people speaking "normal" serbian or croatian then that one dialekt
We have 340000 serbian and croatian speakers in austria
Then there are 20000 burgenlandkroaten that speak that special croatian dialekt and that dialekt is an offical minority language
then the speed thing is, what this graph was about and what grinds my gears
thanks for the response, though
> Unless we're talking speeds over gigabit copper is fine from the basement to your apartmen
FTTB isn't really a thing here either
It's mostly FTTC
I live in the capital, 120m from the national TV station
I get 32mbps
Germany is actually ahead of Austria
Nope
In Germany 3
3% of all households have FTTH/FTTB
That's better than the UK, Serbia and - Austria (1
9%)
Might I ask which one it is ?
same with austria
except for the viking part, but we can change
works for me
nice, I‘d like to see them rockin‘ it
edit: [This looks dope]
In german speaking countries, we are highly aware that we were part of the baddies in WW2
Anyone who claims otherwise is suspicious
Edit: germany and austria for the „AcTuAlLy
“ nerds in here
As an Austrian: Well, we have a kind of love hate relationship with our eternal enemy
But since they spend a lot of money here on their holidays we let them live
It´s not like we are still bitter at those bloody Saupreißn (Prussians/Germans) because of losing the battle Königgrätz
Really, we aren´t mad at those Piefke
We love them
At least their money
On a serious note: I think my generation who hasn´t been in war with any other nation is aware of our history and knows about our historic responsibility
But I do not want to be judged by the actions of my ancestors
Just as I don´t take personal pride in the good things they might have done, I don´t take personal shame for actions they have done
I am not personally responsible for neither
Uff, my girlfriend is very very very Basque
She has a friend from Valencia who is from a rich conservative family, and who has a brother who is in the military (and of course votes for Vox)
The friend is not the brightest tool in the shed, and my girlfriend is rather short-tempered sometimes
So it is a fun mix
I have witnessed my fair share of fun discussions about the civil war and Franco
One discussion started with the friend saying unironically: "Bueno por lo menos con Franco eso no pasaba" while claiming that the majority of rapes in Spain are committed by "chiuis" (or however you write that slur for Latinamericans)
It's almost a meme at this point
Same with Turks and Armenians
Or Turks and Greeks
Or Turks and Kurds
Or Turks and other Turks
Oh [you barely notice them]
You're only hearing what you want to hear
They said it's not what Germans ARE
They did not say that those that did it weren't Germans
Germany has come a long way since then and I don't think it's fair to hold people accountable for something their grandparents did
I blame you for a lot
But not this one
...please continue
Austria also had a victim mentality up to the 70s-80s. But we had to admit that our people were not really against nazi germany
So you admit that the Luxemburgish language is really German
Haha i totally did
Welcome to my life
Everytime I visit my girlfriend's family my stomach doubles in size
They are very proud, because I can eat almost like a Basque
Idk how it's written
I've heard that being used as a slur for Latinos
Chibi or Chiui
Maybe it's a local thing
And Jewish refugees have been turned away at the Swiss border, knowing that they will die in the Third Reich
I guess it was a mixed bag
[A few idealists actually were against it] many didn't care or were complacent, some pretended and tried to survive, [some – very dastardly – just went with the flow, jumping from one political camp to another whenever the felt like it helped them personally] others [wanted to profit as much as possible] without regard for how the profit is made (which is why capitalists are usually complacent with fascism)
But those that were into it (at least around 30-40% of the population), [were *really really really* into it]
That's just peak roasting
She wasn't even smart enough to be the smartest knife
How does carrying the burden look like to you
Haha, i dua di jo nur a bissal vaoaschn heast
I don't know
There's definitely a ch sound
Of course
It *was* part of Germany
I have never heard that in my entire life
I obly heard that people who were born long after WWII don't want to apologize, just acknowledge it
So no we know how carrying the burden does NOT look for you
That still leaves the quermstion of what you expect Germans to do,what do you mean by carrying the burden
Ein Jokus
Wie schön!
No no it wasn't that
I know about the slur "machupichu". It also wasn't "tiraflecha".
Whatever
it was some slur that this girl used while claiming that rapes in Spain are only committed by foreigners
And my gf went ballistic, and started talking about the absolutely disgusting manada case, where the perpetrators were – among other things – a soldier and a Guardia Civil I think, and all of them muy españoles, y mucho españoles
Yes I know
I heard all about it, and it's absolutely horrifying
Even worse is how they are ridiculing the victim
Absolutely disgusting
The best life expectancies in Italy are in the North, thats Alpine climate
Yeah and Northern Italy isn't poorer than Germany, France or the UK
Most judges are already busy all day
No need to keep them occupied even more
A higher fine would suffice
section control, vehicle impounding for repeat offenders, problem solved
The thing is that it isn't considered a proper crime for a reason, unless you're speeding too much
There's just too many cases and judges don't fall from the sky
There's just no way they can handle this many extra people
Maybe if you give out fines according to income as they do in Finland would work
We had "Maturastreich" but that is done after the final exams in the last week of school
After exams sometimes a "Maturastreich" is done
We blocked the entrance to the school parking lot with a boulder somebody brought with a tractor
Yes, in Austria it's called Maturastreich and it happens usually right after the results of the exams being announced
We locked down the whole school with iron chains except for the main entrance and asked a member of the voluntary fire brigade to fill a pool with water right before school began
We also rented a mobile bar and bought 2 barrels of beer
When school began everyone had to enter through the main entrance because the other entrances were locked
We shot everyone including teachers with water guns and got drunk
Yes, we do
Might be an urban myth, but allegedly there were some students who released 3 pigs on the school premises and numbered them #1, #2 and #4 which led to school staff looking for #3 for days
Ours is called "Matura prank" (Matura being the upper level high school finals/university entrance certification), and sensibly done *after* your final exams
The notion is that you do something stupid/funny that ideally is nice for other students but annoying for the teachers
Sometimes it devolves into vandalism though (mostly when people are too drunk during pranking)
Our class brought BBQ equipment, music and drinks and had a grill party in the school yard while blasting loud music
Regarding vandalism, I know from another class that ended up damaging some teacher's car (don't know what their original plan was) and then tried collecting money to help pay for the damage
other stories of more elaborate pranks include breaking into the school and barricading all entrances with the school furniture; running through the school building when there's still school and barging into classrooms, either shooting water guns or throwing candy into classrooms of the lower-level students
I even heard something about a severed pig's head in front of the principal's office (yeah it was a rural area)
We also had a "Maturazeitung" (Matura newspaper), mostly a self-designed and -printed/-copied collection of leaflets including funny stories and quotes of your school time, it's either sold to earn money for going drinking, or sometimes given away
Did you have that as well
We do this after the final exam
wow that's really creative; I love the idea of Matura pranks (that's what we call them, Matura being high school finals) being actually funny and requiring some work to pull off
over here, it sadly devolved into just getting drunk at school and trashing the place, and in some places has been forbidden for that reason
Wrong word boundary, pal
It's Matura (school leaving exam) Streich (prank)
for Austria it's only after your high school finals
tbh Reich just means realm, dominion, and you don't get to pretend you didn't Reich it out together with us just because you switched sides
We are not counting Reichs to begin with, that's only the Germans
We just got Austria/Austro-Hungary, then some 1st republic, then those nazi assholes, and then the 2nd republic
No Reichs involved from our side
Never heard a non native actor speak German without a noticeable accent
Even with Michael Fassbender in Inglourious Basterds, it's totally obvious
Having said this, never heard a German native talk Austrian German without an accent either
There are positive and negative examples of this
I'll never forget Jessica Lange completely butchering it in American Horror Story: Freak Show
Archer, on the other hand, did quite a good job
The Man From U.N.C.L.E, Gaby Teller is a gril from the DDR
There is one scene where she speak with her father, who is played by a German actor
And I needed subtitles to understand her
I like the film but that was so weird to watch her struggle with the sentences
Oh god yes
I am always wondering if they can’t get a German native speaker to check the wording or if they simply don’t care
No not at all
In the movie Magneto kinda "lays low" and hides from the world by becoming a worker in a Polish factory (you're more safe from the American government in a Warsaw pact country
The movie plays in the 80s I think)
It kinda makes sense that he has an accent in Polish, bc it's not supposed to be his native language
[Fassbender speaks (pretty good) German in another X-Men movie] The fact that he's a German Jew is an integral part of that scene
i just started the part of blacklist where the one guy goes to germany and none of the people involved are german natives and i can‘t concentrate because their german is just so bad
if it‘s one guy, okay
but nobody can tell me you can‘t find any german speaking guys in LA
His father is German, but he grew up in Ireland, and while his German is ok-ish, his accent is totally noticeable (not only in the film, but generally)
If I remeber correctly there is also a chase through some backyards and alleyways etc and they look so American
Like, not even close to Germany
And the license plates were completely wrong as well
Honestly they just didn't even try
Yeah his father's from Germany and he was born in Heidelberg
But he grew up mostly in Ireland, so he has a very slight but definitely notable accent
Which is a whole plot point in Inglourious Basterds, fittingly enough
[The scene]
Yeah
His German is absolutely fantastic, but the way he randomly alternates between uvular R (standard German, back of the throat) and alveolar R ("rolling R", some austro-bavarian and alemannic dialects, as well as stage-German do that, but hardly ever alternating like this; the real giveaway is the manner in which he says "rrrrrüpelhaft"), as well as the occasional vowel length and quality (too English) is pretty telling
Which makes the scene even more tense when you know German
The other guy (played by the great August Diehl) is completely aware of the situation from the very beginning
The finger-thing is just the last drop in his bucket of suspicion
"Griasdi" or "Griaseich" is normal when hiking
On the mountain everybody is informal
You would even say "du" to a doctor or an old lady
It gets interesting when you are not sure if you are high enough to be informal
Yes it is very much expected
People who don't greet back are usually either foreigners (they are kind of excused bc of language, except for Germans ofc), or from Vienna
The greeting is usually an informal/intimate "Griaß di"/"Griaß eich", as opposed to the more formal/distant greetings "Grüß Gott", "Guten Tag" or "Griaß Ihna" which you would normally use down below when talking to a stranger
It is a commonly agreed upon social norm, that at >1000m over Triest people are as a rule always per Du (informal/intimate *you*), not per Sie (formal/distant *you*) when adressing one another, regardless of age, social standing, provenance, or anything else
Because when confronted with the forces of high alpine nature, we are all equal, and in a possible emergency situation there's no time for formalities
The greeting once you reach the summit is "Berg Heil" ("Moutain Hail"), which signifies that you have achieved your goal and now can eat your bread and cheese and chocolate, and maybe have a sip of Schnaps, while enjoying the view and the silence
Everything above 1500m you say "Servus" instead of "Grüß Gott"
Grias eich
Servus
Habidere (literally translated: have the honour
or if they are clearly germans it is usually just Hallo (hello), because they look a bit confused when saying one of the above versions
Yes
It’s common to greet even strangers ever time you see them (I live in a small village in a rural valley)
However as soon as you get into a city and you greet a stranger they look at you as if you just said “go fuck yourself”.
It‘s not a tradition it‘s politeness and I guess kinda part of our culture that you say hello, wish them well or start a conversation with anybody you meet in any area (except cities or highly populated areas)
Really
Last weekend i was for the first time hiking in italy (actually a mountain on the austrian italian border) and while and all of the austrian hikers greeted as usual, to my surprise none of the italians did before i initiated contact

Also, the city borders of Vienna are markers as well: people don't greet each other inside the city (yes, we have hills and nature inside our capital), but do greet as soon as you are outside the city limits
"over Triest" obviously
I wouldnt really say that its just the viennese
More like people from the "flat land" in general
And even they learn quick after passing some fellow travellers
"Griaß di/eich" actually
Or, "Griass Enk"
In Austria and Bavaria the most formally  neutral and way to greet someone is to say Grüß Gott
You'll hear it often when hiking along with variations on 'Grüß dich/euch/Sie' in whatever dialect of the region
Grüß Gott (Greet God) isn't very present outside of the Bavarian dialect group so often outsiders will joke back and say 'I didn't know we where this high yet' as you'd need to be in heaven to greet god
I believe they call this humour in Germany
German is a formal language and Austrians are really obsessed with titles
I don't know about Norwegian but in German you have 2 words for "you". Du (for friends, family, people that offer you to say "du") and Sie (teachers, bosses, doctors, strangers)
The same exists for greetings
Griasdi (greet you - informal) and Grüßgott (Greet god - formal)
It got more relaxed than 20 years ago but if you say "Du" to an old lady or - god forbid - to a doctor you are seen as immensely unfriendly
Edit: Unless you're hiking
We're all friends up there :)
Well, Triest is traditionally the point of reference in all of Austria, so yes
Seriously
It's commonplace where I'm from (OÖ)
It's not so much a set rule, but just convention
It's *kinda* informal, but not too bad
It usually is used between friends and acquaintances, not for people you don't know or have to interact in a professional manner with
Griass Enckkk
Actually it was in friuli/carinthia and it was an intermediate difficulty
However we didnt encounter too many people further up and most of the italians looked more like tourists than hikers tbh, so i guess thats it
Yes
I remembered that when I read your post
I have never heard it in carinthia or styria
We used to own it
Was our biggest port
Good times
Heard it plenty of times in carinthia
How often have you been to the peak of a mountain
Meh
Nowadays it's all in the EU family anyways ️️
The Krampus thing
I saw the movie ,,raw" from 2016 when we stayed at a hotel when we went to cracow for a schooltrip
It was bizzare how the narrator read the dialogue between 2 persons
Well since the krampus is an alpine thing I'd say our hate for EVERY NATION in the whole world
I couldn't think of a country we like
ah, we used to do the same
got the fish from our neighbor though, didn't have to buy it
That was my favourite part about Spain
There is something nice about eating lunch at 3 and dinner at 10
as long as they don't offer to massage your neck and shoulders while you're standing at the urinal like in SEA
My south tyrolean neighbor shudders when I mention that I sometimes add a bit of Berbecue ketchup when I make sugo
ok you got me
that's the first one where I have to say I haven't seen that yet at home
maybe because most people who own cattle have a truck or transporter here
That's just normal
Just imagine a perchtenlauf in the USA
That really sounds like a French stereotype
popular with inner city Bobo parents here too; the bike models are normally imported from NL
It's the opposite here
I can never imagine only being in my shoes at home
Whenever I visit a friend, I always take them off
Whenever I visit my family in the states, though, I keep the instinct of taking off my shoes
I had to keep my shoes on every time I entered a house
Thankfully, when I rent a hotel room or an AirBNB, I always got to take my shoes off :)
As in the card game
yeah used to be a thing, don't think carp is still very popular though
we had it once on Christmas Day, but I don't think we bought it live
Keeping it in the bathtub also helps filter any mud from the pond out of the fish, a common complaint about carp is that it tastes like a swamp
Well they were part if Austria after all, it's lovely that they still have the drink and use a name based on the Austrian one
Oh no
I am a weirdo
Even in Iceland they keep their swimsuits on in the Sauna
in sweden
source: study in sweden right now
The hottest saunas we have are called Finnish Sauna, and they're about 90°
you get sued, and *you* get sued
by god why doesn't she just get a wheelbarrow bike
I've seen some in Denmark that had four seats, could even take a friend home, or dump her shopping in there
selecting for quiet babies; clever
Well ethnic Tyrolean but with strong Italian influences
Well they are all Italian already and one notices that when compared to North Tyroleans xD
oh sorry, I meant more like [this] or [this] or [this]
Do you have non-FKK saunas in Germany
Oh no i'm so sorry
unless you drink diluted ethanol

„einen polnischen machen“, roughly translated “doing a polish“ for leaving a party without telling anyone, including the host
"Hinter schwedische Gardinen wandern" (To go behind Swedish Curtains) is a German expression for going to prison
We do not have an expression for splitting the bill among a group, because it is common practice here that each person always pays their own food and drinks
We just call that "paying".
We have other other expressions for other stuff though
- Something that is "behmisch"/"böhmisch" or bohemian is something that is a knock-off, a poor imitation or cheap quality (sorry neighbours)
Funnily enough there's a huge park in Vienna, the famous *Prater*, and there's also a less famous and smaller and less fancy *böhmischer Prater*. Both are actually very beautiful though
The latter bears this name, because it's in Favoriten, where all the "Ziegelbehm" lived, i.e. all the Czech immigrants who came to work in the Viennese brick making industry in the 19th century
Maybe the expression has something to do with that
- An "Engländer" is a tool, which you would call a monkey wrench in English
- "Einen Polnischen (Abgang) machen", to do a Polish (exit), is something I've heard
It's would be our equivalent to an Irish goodbye
- A "Russenluster" or Russian chandelier is a lamp without lampshade and without properly hiding the cable work
Usually used as a provisionary measure, e.g. when moving, at construction sites, when you really want to live in that "poor student" aesthestic in your early 20s, etc
[Like this]
- A "Russian" can also be pickled fish
In Germany they call it "Bismarckhering" I think
- A "französische Dusche" or French shower is when you are in need of a shower, but just use a large amount of deodorant or similar things instead
Classic among 14-year olds after PE class
- The "Franzosenkrankheit" or "Franzosenpest", the French plague, is of course syphillis
- Ironically you can prevent this sickness with a "Pariser" (Parisian), i.e. a Condom
- When a prostitute offers "französisch" as an extra service, that does not mean there's going to be language classes, but rather sex without a condom
- Same with "griechisch" (Greek) and anal sex
- Same with a "spanische Krawatte" (spanish necktie) and mammary sex
- Speaking of which, the "Krawatte" comes from a people called "Krawodn", which is a dialect term for "Kroaten", i.e. Croatians
- A "Schwedenbombe" or Swedish bomb is what they call a "Mohrenkopf" or Moorish head in Germany (yes, that's racist), i.e. a kind of small chocolate-covered cake filled with foamy sugar
"Schwedenbombe" is an example of a brand name (they are produced by the Viennese company Niemetz) becoming a general name
Schwedenbomben have a 95% market share among "Mohrenküsse" in Austria, because they're the best
They are called like that because the inventor got the idea from a Swedish friend
- "Schwabo" means "Swabian" in Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian and is a common expression for "German-speaker" among people from the ex-Yugoslavian countries
There is a German expression "Leben wie Gott in Frankreich" (to live like God in France), meaning to live carefree and in excess
It eighter comes from the wealth and privilege of the clergy in pre revolutionary France, or from the lack of influence the catholic church had after the revolution, meaning that in France God has now retired and can lean back and enjoy his life
Das schaut russisch aus/Der russische Weg/
Smth
looks russian/The russian way (to do smth
Used mostly for when something is made in a way that seems crude, but actually works
Same logic goes for the russian way to do something
Sometimes other eastern countries are used instead, but Russia is the most common
not "not right", rather "hard to understand", akin to "ich verstehe nur Bahnhof"
Also "Ich versteh' nur spanisch" "I only understood spanish" means that you actually don't understand what the other person said
Another favourite of mine is also "Fachchinesisch" "field chinese" when someone is talking about rather complicated stuff from a specific (technical) field
In Austria it's a bohemian village :)
>Orbán doesn't actually want out of the EU, not while *he gets* lots of money from them anyway
FTFY
Its at the same time Eastern Europe, Central Europe and Central Eastern Europe
There are multiple classifications of this which differ according to what kind of historical development or regional differences you want to express
Its the same with the Balkans that may or may not include Slovenia, Greece and Romania
Its a well known fact that the Balkans begins at the Ringstraße xD
Yeah making such a fuss about academcial fuzzy definitions of regions is just plain dumb
Its so malleable that it becomes meaningless
I cannot understand most people from one state (Vorarlberg) because their dialect is so different compared to the rest of Austria
Many Germans have a problem with understanding the local dialect I speak
It’s really far from being German as not only the words but also a lot of grammar is completely different
Jessica Lange in American Horror Story: Freak Show
Voralberger dialect is impossible to understand
It’s suppose to be an Austrian dialect of German (which I speak) but it’s nothing like it
Yeah all the time
We have very weird dialects
When I drive 1 hour in a certain direction my Mom won't understand any person there
I can somewhat communicate there though
A good example which demonstrates this is the movie "Die Hard".
A good example which demonstrates this is the movie "Die Hard".

I personally don’t even count Swiss German as German because who tf can even understand them besides the Swiss
But then again that’s what many German must think about Austrian dialects as well
I think Gus' actor is Italian
"waaay down, waaay down, waay down
Tbh most of us younger people don't really speak with such a strong dialect anymore
I think it's not that hard to understand us, but even I sometimes struggle to understand the older generations because they still use dialect words that we don't use anymore
>"I am sorry, could you please speak slowly and more high German
I get what your problem was, but it's not hard to guess, that this triggers Austrians too
(The prejudice goes, that high-German-speakers think of themselves as more civilized in a way)
Recently read a story about a german moving to Vienna
They heard "pfiat di" and thought it was the alpine version of "fick dich", thinking people just casually insulted each other as a goodbye
Like, I wouldn't even mind mind if they got some native speaker actor from the street, who speaks in a super weird dialect (like Bernese or Platt or whatever), but this is just insulting
>I personally don’t even count Swiss German as German because who tf can even understand them besides the Swiss
Says the Austrian
>But then again that’s what many German must think about Austrian dialects as well
yeah
I can, although I'm from a region with a bavarian-based dialect
Understanding spoken language is easy to me, when reading r/BUENZLI I sometimes have to imagine the word spoken out loud to figure it out
Well I'm from Vorarlberg and I can understand most of them
>14 hour flight
If you fly over Aruba, maybe
But you're still right, it is far apart, but more in the sense that the heaviest dialects can be found in "remote" places
Lmao I love that and totally agree with you
Bavarian and swiss german are different languages
No, high German is what developed in Germany as a "common denominator German". But while in Austria (and probably all German speaking nations besides Germany) it is much more common to speak dialect, but *write* in high German, Germans have widely adopted it for speaking as well
This is all just personal experience from discussing this with Germans
It also seems like the sentiment is completely different
In Germany it is almost unaccepted to insist on speaking your own dialect, while Austrians almost see high German as a foreign influence, although it is of course taught in schools and you will never find i.e. official emails in dialect
I believe you
I just think being aware of these things can only help
That's also why I said it is the prejudice
That doesn't mean it's true
Me too
Someone else thought everyone stopped working at 5 and said "Fertig
" to each other :D
And nevertheless is my „remote place“ less than an hour from the German border in a valley with 40
000 inhabitants
So not remote at all
The Germans across the border are Bavarians
Unless if you're from Vorarlberg, I'd be surprised if they don't understand you
Ok u/HungryAndHornySlut
Yeah I guess
Now if you tell me the people in London on average come closest to speaking 'BBC English' then it's pretty much the same
I guess you also have a kind of similar language situation with the USA as Austria and Germany
Sure, I understand that
I wasn't trying to say you should have understood her if that's how it came out
Even if she wasn't from Vorarlberg ;)
I really don’t get it
I’m from Tyrol, we are not remote at all
We speak a dialect many Germans don’t understand, even Bavarians
Oh ok, well I didn't expect that
May I ask which region in Tyrol that is
The Zillertal
As I said, around 40
000 inhabitants in a valley that’s around 40km long
I myself live 60km away from the capital Innsbruck and it’s less than an hour drive to the German border
It´s pretty much the same here
In older times there was a different saying though
Back then the postal service and railroad (owned by the state) were a pool for people who didn´t really want to work and still enjoy several benefits
The saying was:
"Wer nix taugt und wer nix kann,
geht zur Post oder zur Bahn
Wer auch dafür z'deppad ist,
der wird Polizist".
(very) rough translation:
"Those who are useless and incompetent will work at the postal service or the railroad corporation
Those who are even too stupid for that will become police officers
I wouldn´t say this still applies nowadays anymore though
Street sweeper
Although city employees are decently paid AFAIK
Wer nichts weiß und wer nichts kann geht zu Post und Bahn (He who knows nothing and can't do anything can go to the postal service or the railway) absolutely don't agree with it but it's a ryming :)
That Austria is more responsible than Germany for WW2 because Hitler was born here
An increasingly common narrative
A little late to the game, but here we go:
My best friend's host family in Ireland was really disappointed when we told them, that the majority of Austrians do not live in the mountains (and that there are areas that aren't mountain-y but rather flat)
Like directly next to - or rather on - a ski slope
And no, we don't all ski to our schools or jobs everyday
I'm from the northern hemisphere, not the southern one
Some americans think that we're australia and are suprised when you explain that that's a dirfferent country
Well what was your favourite wine
Fun fact, unicorns were hunted to extinction because unicorn meat is considered a delicacy with aphrodisiac properties in Finland
What about your supreme leader
Every time someone claims that nazis were left wing, somewhere a political scientist gets a stroke
Oh the discussions I've had about that one
Despite all the evidence
I dread the possibility of Sanders winning and media outlets announcing the US to be a "socialist" country now
Somehow someone needs to teach them more fitting political terminology
You dont get it, the more the state does the more socialist it is, thats how it works
You know what's worse
People from your own country talking about "no-go zones" in your own capital
I have been asked by family members from rural regions what kind of weapons I wear use to survive the constant attacks in Vienna
To be fair, a LOT of teachers explain the Berlin Wall really badly, even here in Europe
When I was taught about in school I only had the vaguest (and wrong, as it turns out) notion on what it looked like and how it worked
Our teacher never really explained in an understandable way that Berlin was a special case city smack dab in the middle of East Germany
For the longest time I believed that the  regular border between East and West just happened to run through Berlin because my teacher always talked about the Berlin Wall as a wall between the East and the West and mentioned it in the same breath as the iron curtain
Which, technically correct, but quite misleading
This was pre-internet and it took me years to have my misconception corrected
If he had mentioned that Berlin was *behind* the iron curtain, that some small parts of it belonged to the west because of symbolism and that the Berlin Wall worked like a medieval city wall I would have caught on a lot earlier
Don't be ridiculous
Everybody knows that rich Texans ride to school in tanks
Poor Texans have to use assault rifles like stick horses
> Some will get offended and argue if you label US policies they support as "socialist".
I mean, that's no different here
For some reason, y'all seem to use that word in the wrong context a lot
That's exactly the crux of the issue
There can be no debate that, no matter the reason, the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war against Serbia is what sparked WW1
But this, combined with the fact Hitler happened to be born in Austria, gave rise to the commonly accepted, revisionist narrative that "Austria started both world wars". Ignoring that Hitler was a *pan-German* nationalist, hated Austria as its own political entity, and came to power in Germany as a German citizen, and considered himself German and was considered as such by others
That *after* the Anschluss, when Austria was a functionally fully part of Nazi Germany, many Austrians gleefully took part in WW2 Nazi crimes, is a whole other, separate can of worms
Mostly anglo "history bros" and smug Germans
The old and tired Hitler-Beethoven joke also doesn't help
Deine Landsleute immer wieder mal zum Beispiel
Lots of idiotic memes too
Like once a week someone thinks they're totally funny by posting a "haha Austria started two world wars and blamed both on the Germans" picture to r/Austria
look at the discussions under such posts on r/historymemes, the prime sub for armchair historians
> What would a no-go zone be
Actually it is a zone closed off by barriers and hooded men
Nobody can enter or exit unless their skin tone is [in the lower part of this chart] There's huge portraits of Shakira - hips be upon her - in all the streets
They have loud-speakers everywhere, out of which the song ["Danger Zone"] blurrs at a high volume 24/7
They were right though, your English is pretty good :P
Just imagine my American relatives reacting to me saying that the local party close to the Neonazis had German liberal roots
They thought I was one of the left= Nazis idiots
Easy mistake to make
Cadillacs are driven to church, gun shows, football games and the oil fields, not school
Well, I guess that's somewhat up to how you personally define it, but socialism has a fixed definition with not that much wiggle room
Many of my close relatives, includign my great-grandfather, were massive Nazis and Hitler supporters early on before and after the Anschluss, so believe me, I know this stuff better than anyone
And Austria was occupied by the Allies just like Germany until 1955, when they left on the condition that Austria declare itself "eternally neutral". How exactly do you think it should have been punished more
Split into two parts and remained under occupation to this day
Nobody ever did
Fun fact about that second shot: It came from one of the biggest Austrian war ships in the Danube fleet, and was fired onto the city of Belgrad
Austria-Hungary had a fleet on the Danube
Yeah, nobody ever denied that
The actual first shot of the war
Princip's shot started it, but that wasn't yet war, just terrorism
I'm pro vaccinations but against any forced medical procedures
Who needs a law for that
Just charge them with the crime they commit, attempted murder
Stupidity doesn't hold in court and isn't a legal defence in any form
Vaccinations are great
They not only protect you, but they protect people around you that can't be vaccinated due to age, illness, or allergies
By having less and less people immunized against diseases, the disease can reach these people and kill them
Yes, it will kill them
The diseases which vaccines prevent against - whether it's polio or even the flu - are not a joke
They can cause life threatening fevers and complications
They can cause life lasting side effects
They can kill you
By not vaccinating your kids, you not only harm them, but you also harm others
Vaccinations should never be a choice
They must be mandatory unless you cannot have them due to allergies, age, or illness, PERIOD
> with exceptions made for immun-compromised people and other similar cases where vaccinations are too dangerous
No one ever suggested that those people should be vaccinated
I couldn't agree more
Sometimes I even think antivaxers have our best interest in mind
All they want to do is solve the overpopulation crisis guys, why all the hate
So you are fine with asocial people putting others at risk
LOL this must be the most hilarious case of "internet lawyer" that I've ever seen
No I'm not fine with it but forced medical procedures are worse - dictatorship style
I don't want the government to force their citizens to get substances injected
Sure, vaccinations are great
This is just too authoritatian
This isn't "dictatorship style". What happens here is requesting that citizens take their responsibility for society (people benefit, not the government or the leader) seriously to get benefits paid for by society
And besides that, most mandatory vaccinations are targeted at children who cannot decide for themselves anyways
Not to English but to Spanish
I used to live in a student dorm with lots of international students with a shared kitchen (shared between 15 people or so), and a disgusting microwave that no one ever cleaned and thus often became moldy inside and everybody always complained about it
So someone "solved" the problem by putting a sign with a graphic instruction to clean the microwave after using it and then a sentence in 3 languages (Spanish bc of some Argentine exchange students who barely spoke English, let alone German):
ACHTUNG SCHIMMEL
BEWARE OF THE MOULD
CUIDADO EL CABALLO BLANCO
The last one means/is supposed to mean "Beware of the white horse", because the German word "Schimmel" means both the fungus called mould, but it can also be used to describe a white horse
Whoever wrote the sign either thought they were funny, or just didn't know better
The Argentines had no idea what was going on, the fact that later someone drew a white horse on the sign didn't make it better
Good thing we also had a Mexican dude with very good English and German skills, he explained it to them
This is one of my favourites here so far
Cancer flesh
mmhh
When I hear body bag, I think of Tatort, not of a backpack
nothing but Smetov Yeldos is a maschine
Maybe Lloret de Mar
> Las Vegas is also known for the strip clubs I guess
But you can find them all over Europe
I don't think they're illegal in any country here
Is it
It's pretty normal for the height of summer
It rained and cooled over the last few days
Today was the first hotter day in a week and it was humid as fuck
It's supposed to become pretty hot soon, I like it
I‘m doing surprisingly ok
I guess the Alps and other mountain ranges help to cool the temperature a little bit
Not saying that it‘s really cool over here, but those 19-24° are way more welcome than the 25-28° my german friends have
Agreed, not so bad here
Last time I checked, Vienna is at an astonishing altitude of about 150m above sea level
So whatever are you on about
Not really how it works
It's cool in the low regions of Austria too
I don't even live in the mountains but around 280m and the whole of May was rainy and June had about 4 days of sunshine so far, at this point I would kill for 2 weeks of 40 degrees
You do too
And don‘t forget to drink water
> The avg
elevation of Austria is also 910m.
Averages are pretty meaningless, especially if it does not consider population distribution
Look at all major cities, they are well below that
Vienna ~150m, Graz ~350m, Linz ~250m, Only Salzburg (~430m) and Innsbruck (~570m) are a little higher up, but still way below that average
OTOH everything below ~35 is easily bearable, bitching about 28°C is a bit
weird
Especially considering that a lot of people also go on holidays in warmer regions
It rained a lot here in the last few weeks, so I am happy it has finally warmed up a bit more
Today it was 26 degrees and tjat was the hottest day this week so far
That's not hot
Edit: actually my colleague had to wait 45 minutes outside this morning and she was cold
In jeans and a cardigan
I really feel like I am in a different universe
It certainly isn't that hot here haha :)
We'll see
Now we got a few sunny days before a possibly rainy start of July but fingers crossed it's just a pessimistic weather report
Sadly I can't make use of the warm days now because I got some nasty angina but at least my girlfriend can go out a bit
the grumpy Austrian trying to bond over shared complaining, and the exuberant USian trying to bond over being positive
how very interesting to see
I am not complaining
I think the weather is great
Not too hot and not too cold
I can still open my windows in the morning and let some fresh cool air in
It just sounds like we are the exception here in Europe
France is not the second largest country
Ukraine is bigger
France is the 3rd largest
I think it‘s because all major central european rivers are located near or in the Blue Banana, with the river that was the central point of travel and the economy, the Rhine/Rhein, starting, going through and ending in the Blue Banana Region
And after that with river Po ending (I think
) inside the Blue Banana and also Thames starting, going through and ending in the Blue Banana Region
But france isn't situated entirely in europe
Skis also
But alpine skis, not cross-country skis like you nordics
Beer or Spritzer in our hands, a cigarette in our mouths and complaining about that from the start
I'd say us Brits are born with a cup of tea in our hands
Man if you had any kind of ground elevation i'd be all over your country
Nah, also Skis just like Norway
Alpine skis though
I'm Krapfen
Gave me a proper chuckle there :D
When someone in Austria asks me I feel Viennese
If someone from another European country would ask me, I would say Austrian
&#x200B;
And if someone from outside of Europe asks me, I usually say that I'm German, because I'm sick and tired of talking about Kangaroos, Koalas and Australian Rule Football or whatever this is
That's the age old enthnicity vs nationality question, I'm neither but half Irish so it's always the question, am I Austrian because I was born and raised here
Am I Irish because those ethics were put into me by my father
Am I both
And it always depens on the person you're talking to, if it's with an austrian then it depends on the topic, if it's about anything but Ireland/Immigrants I'm Austrian, and vice versa with an Irishman
It's either Liezen or maaaaybe Graz if you'd ask me, they're a not that ugly but I'd say they are somewhat close
People here tend to say St
Pölten
It's not as bad as people think though
I drove past the city a few years ago and I had no intention to stop there
It's really a shame, considering how beautiful other cities in your country are
Wels is way more ugly than Graz
Cannot speak for Liezen though
Graz is beautiful
Whaaat, Graz isn't ugly
You want an ugly city
Take Linz
Linz is really ugly
But i agree on Liezen
Terrible
Nah, it's obviously St
Pölten
Graz is not at all ugly
Only the southern and western parts
Since i moved from eggenberg/wetzelsdorf to jakomini, i can see its beauty
My top pick would be Oberwart
There is nothing nice in this city
Oh yeah, Wels too
Though to be fair none of them are even close to the given examples, we have pretty high standards
The only city that came to my mind was Linz
I don't think I've ever seen an ugly city in Austria besides Linz
I've never been to Liezen tho
Have you ever even visited Linz
I've been living there for the past three years, and it's so much more beautiful than Vienna or Graz
Yeah, it has its problem districts, but which city hasn't that
If you leave the Landstraße behind you you can get into some beautiful neighbourhood in less than five minutes
ACAB, Austrian Cities Are Beautiful
Wels
Wels is like Linz without the good looking parts
Yes, I've been to Linz a few times
I wouldn't have written what i wrote if that wasn't the case
I still don't like the City
Never been in Wels but also not planning to go there, especially after reading this
I can see a lot of them, depending on where I go in the city
Vienna's had an ongoing disagreement between the governing coalition parties about how to deal with that problem (more bans/police vs
more social workers), and it continues to be an issue around certain hot spots (mostly train or subway stations)
Going home after work I sometimes pass screaming and fighting, extremely drunk, drugged or otherwise crazy people, I'd say it happens about once or twice a week
But it depends where you look of course
In the touristy city center, you won't see many (beware of scammers and pickpockets instead)
Also *inside* public transport it's a lot better that outside
I encounter people like the above only about once per month inside the actual trains
Beggars are more common sitting the stations though
I think it's mostly a problem of how your psychological health system is set up
Secondly it can be facilitated through local climate, and it's also influenced by available housing and shelter systems, but also by common-sense stuff like building layout/zoning (no shops that sell alcohol near entrances, etc)
To a lesser degree is is also an issue of security/police presence (although I find it makes places feel *less* safe when there's always these damn grumpy security guards running around) and alcohol bans (Vienna had its first anti open container area designated around a train station recently for that reason)
I think it's actually Asia that's doing a lot better in that regard than the West
I mean, in the warmer areas you'll have lots of homeless of course (facilitated by the climate), but they're not as loud/crazy/aggressive as the ones we seem to have here
They probably have less patient rights and just lock up whoever behaves a bit too weirdly
Artikel 1
Österreich ist eine demokratische Republik
Ihr Recht geht vom Volk aus
Austria is a democratic republic
[The republics] might comes from its peoples
Article 1
Austria is a democratic Republic
The people have the Power
I really like the short and simple and yet meaningful language
What I don't like in constitutions (and legal texts in general) is that festive language that you can find for example in Germany's constitution
Austria is a Republic
It's power lies with the people
> the supremacy of God and the rule of law
Which one is it then
It's funny how both the Canadian and Australian constitutions mention God in the first sentence, meanwhile the Spanish one (also a constitutional monarchy) apparently does not
We have a very similar story

Our constitution is an interwar constitution as well
Even if they did, reinstating it later still makes it an interwar one
I mean ours did change in between of course, but that doesn't change the nature of our old constitution

I went to a club in Berlin and it turned out to be a sex club, and there was an orgy about to happen
They made an spreadsheet to designate all of the stis people did/did not have and what their sexual preferences were

that's how AirBnB was actually *meant* to work, people renting out a room in their house or, for the daring ones, their apartment while they're gone
just a little extra money, no real influence on the housing market and below taxable levels, all's fine
now it's all semi-professional renting companies and fake profile pics of the "couple" you're renting from, and then you turn up and it turns out the whole apartment is managed by a guy professionally, with on-call service and little packaged bathroom amenities
it's all a huge tax evasion scam and normal people can't find apartments to rent anymore because it's all used for what's basically illegal hotels now
... and the worst part is, people apparently are *expecting* that shit now
Weird ... I use Airbnb multiple times a year and never had a bad experience so far

Your Asian massage story is my favorite

AirBnB was meant as "couchsurfing with money", not "hey let's rent a hotel room in this residential apartment block". read [this comment]

That we had a fascist dictatorship and a civil war before the Nazis came
And that the party that lead this dictatorship is in power now
Yeah, everything between world war 1 and 2 is the first thing which comes in my mind
I’m not sure how ‘brave’ Michael actually was, as only two days later after his glorious unification, the Ottomans were already marching again through Bucharest
As much as it pains me to say, his myth is only a part of the communist rewriting of the national history from the time they needed heroes to base their national pride on
While I’m sure the guy did some outstanding deeds at the time, he was by far not as potent as Romanian historiography still claims he was
The ÖVP is the newly (after WW2) formed followup party to the Christian Social Party

The revolution wasn't just in Prussia it was all over the multitude of German states
It was a cry for unification which actually for a time succeeded and an assembly was formed in Frankfurt but then it failed and so German unification came from up top and not the general populace
It's technically not illegal to eat Wiener Schnitzel with sauce
But it should be
Going to watch a movie in cinema alone
The first few times I did felt strange, but now, well, before the whole pandamic shit went down, I almost all the time go solo
It is just easier if you don't have to plan with other people in mind and find the right time and cinema
Even more so if it is a movie I want to see asap, for example to avoid spoilers or just hyped about to see
I honestly learned so much from [this video] arte is an invaluable service
Yeah that sounds about right
The traditional version also is really puffed up as well
Having the schnitzel lying in a sauce does destroy that puff and crispness
So I usually eat lingonberryjam(~european cranberry
) with it
I just dip the piece I am about to eat in it or spread the jam onto that piece
Well it's jam and not sauce
The problem with sauce is losing the crisp puff breading from the schnitzel
As the breading soaks itself
The lingonberry jam isn't as liquid and you usually just dip the piece you are going to eat in it
Main difference sauce is liquid and the schnitzel soaks it up, lingonbery jam isn't completely solid but doesn't soak the schnitzel
both systems have their advantages and disadvantages
see my comment [here]
haha and I just wanted to post this [relevant introduction to the topic in german]
hah funny coincidence that that's exactly how we do it here: no refills or hovering waiters, very little tipping
also see the comment [here] that explains why
Austrian German has hungarian and slavic influences that regular German does not
I think the fact that you can make words infinitely long
For example, if we want to describe a certain thing we just plaster two words/nouns together
E.g. Handtuch (towel) is literally Handcloth or the well known Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz is word by word translated: Beefetiquettemonitoringtasktransferlaw
And because of that we have a word for e v e r y t h i n g. There‘s no thing that doesn‘t have a german word
And if it really doesn‘t, make up one of your own
Really, if you know how to plaster random words together then you can make up words of your own and everybody will understand it
Or maybe also that you can move the words around in a sentence and it will still mean the same
It just shifts the attention from the human to the object to the time to the place etc etc
I noticed not many languages have that
English and German are one of the few I can think of right now
E.g.
* Ich habe heute viele Bäume in Österreich gesehen
(I saw many trees today in Austria
)  (Attention is on the human)
* Viele Bäume habe ich heute in Österreich gesehen
Attention is on the thing - here the trees)
* Heute habe ich viele Bäume gesehen
(Attention is on the time - here today)
* In Österreich habe ich heute viele Bäume gesehen
(Attention is on the place - here Austria)
Ofc you can shift the words also in many more ways, but that‘s about the main few
Depending on how you shift the verb it becomes an exclamation or a question too:
* Habe ich heute viele Bäume in Österreich gesehen
(Verb is first place so it‘s a question
* Ich habe heute viele Bäume in Österreich gesehen
(For this sentence exclamation is about the same thing as a normal sentence so yeah
Other things that are pretty unique imo:
* Ä, Ö and Ü aren‘t letters of their own (In languages like finnish and estonian they are)
They‘re shortcuts for ae, oe and ue
If the letters aren‘t available on websites a German would just write ae, oe or ue without thinking too much about it
* ß is a shortcut for sz
It‘s basically an s and a z stacked together
Really, look at old german writing: the s used to be written similar to a modern f and the z used to have a weird underthingy like a handwritten g. The ß used to have one too, but I guess it kind of faded along with the one the z had
Reminds me of a story a guy told me
He was from the US and came to Salzburg (Austria) to study trumpet at the university
He knew German before but of course not at a native speaker level, let alone Austrian dialect
So one day his professor told him during a rehearsal: „Sie können ruhig lauter spielen“. (literal translation: „you can quietly play louder“. And he was sitting there wondering how to do that
The actual translation of the sentence is: „Don‘t worry, you can play louder“. The word „ruhig“ means quiet, but is also used as „don’t worry“.
German has that too, it's just pronounced differently
"Die Magd" definitively isn't neutral, though diminuitives always are and "das Mädchen" (which is the currently preferred translation for "the girl") thus is
One phrase that comes to mind would be "Es geht sich aus". Literally translated "It goes itself out". A sentence that initially confuses a lot of Germans that move to Austria
It can be applied in a lot of different contexts and usually means that there is enough of something (time, money, space)
"Shit, I am late
sorry, will we still reach the train in time
"Yes, das geht sich aus
The verb in that context has its origin in Czech and is a literal translation of "vyjít" (according to an article I found)
Other words that come to mind:
Kukuruz (Serbo-Croatian origin, from 'kukuruz') = Corn
(Standard German word for it is 'Mais')
Powidl (Czech origin, from 'povidla') = Plum jam
(Standard German word for it is 'Pflaumenmus')
Strizzi (Czech origin, from 'strýc' = uncle) = cheeky or mischievous person
(apparently also a word for pimp)
(Standard German word with a similar meaning \[minus the pimp\] would be 'Lausbube')
Bussi (probably Czech origin, from 'pusa' = kiss) = an affectionate, non-sexual kiss, usually on the cheek
(I don't think there is an equivalent in Standard German)
Deschek (Hungarian origin, from 'tessék' = please) = uhm
like someone who has to do all the work
I guess a good example would be a group project, where one does the majority of the work
"Am I the deschek
" would be a rhetorical question as a response to your group (that keeps asking you "Could you do X for us
" whilst not doing much themselves) as a signal that you really don't appreciate the current situation
(Not sure what the Standard German equivalent would be)
Mulatschag (Hungarian origin, from ' mulatság'=revelry) = revelry
(Standard German word would be 'Festlichkeit')
There are also more Italian influences in Austrian German than in Standard German like Karfiol (ital
: ' cavolfiore') = cauliflower  ...and so on
(Standard German word is 'Blumenkohl')
It's mostly just vocabulary
In fact, it is so commonly used that some words, like „Mädchen“ (girl) have become standard
The suffixes -lein, -el, -erl, -li, etc
can also be used and have the same meaning
But that's not the dual form
> they follow no logical pattern
at all
They do in Althochdeutsch and previous Germanic languages - modern German is full of simplifications, vowel shifts and other stuff
That's the results I got, when I googled for origins of the listed words above
there didn't seem to be any ambiguity as to where they are coming from (except Kukuruz, which listed Serbian and Czech as origins)
There are also words, that have its origin in Slovene, or were influenced by Slovene
[Keusche] for example
Sumemr time
I don't understand how anyone wants it to be dark earlier
> I have a few weeks of confusion ahead
I have some days of absolute joy because it's still light outside in the evening
But now even in summer it get's dark earlier
Yeah, I agree, I'd rather have summertime in summer, and switch one hour even further into that direction in winter, to have the sunset at 5 instead of 4 in December
Haha
Is a bikini two kinis or every second kini
>Heart attack rates go up after the clocks go forward
for a day but not in average for the week (which suggest that people who would have gotten a heart attack anyways just got it a few days earlier)
Also I don't get it
Just go to bed an hour earlier or get up an hour later and you have the same amount of sleep
It's not rocket science
Seems like many of these problems are caused by work and school(!) simply starting too early (the latter is conformed by noumerous studies)
If you start later summer time is no problem any more
My natural rhythm I slide into is working between 10 and 18
Summer time means more light afterwards
yeah, much better than no sun after 5pm
Funny thing is that biweekly means either twice a week or every two weeks
> i) that still indicates that changing to summertime puts the body under stress
No it doesn't. It indicates that people sleeping one hour less for a day puts the body under stress
>ii) the same studies also show that the risk of heart attacks drops after the change back to standard time in winter, indicating that the body never fully adapted to summertime
Again, it doesn't. It just indicates that sleeping an hour longer reduces the risk of an heart attack for a day
There's no significant differences in heart attack rates in summer times vs normal times that can be traced back to the changing the time
> it's about the mismatch of the circadian clock and social clock
True that
Our "social clock" is absolutely terrible
Starts much too early
During summer if not forced into some kind of schedule my natural rythm tends towards going to bed at about 1am and get up at 9am
Interestingly summer time means I get much more sun
>cortisol metabolism has been shown to adapt by only 2 minutes instead of 60 minutes
[Are you talking about this study
] Because you seem to completely misunderstand it
During DST the time is changed by an hour and the cortisol phases change by "only" 58 minutes, so almost an hour, not 2 minutes like you constantly claim
I wonder
Do people like you go to bed/get up at the same time every day
Never stay up a little late or go to bed early
>You would cancel out any positive effect a later start of school and work day would have
For half a year: yes
For the other half year the time doesn't change so the effect is positive
\+ you get the very nice positive effect that the afternoons/evening have sun
Which for me personally is super important for my mental health
Basically everyone I know is always looking forward to going to summer time and hates going the other way because it's just so damn depressing having no sun in the afternoons
I seem to have the superpower to be able to sleep even while not being tired enough so that i actually *need* it
> But I'm definitely not going to start discussing anecdotal evidence, that's not science but personal opinions
But I don't care about what is better on average (over I guess multiple latitudes, which skews the results a lot)
I care what's better for me
Summer time is so much better for me, it's ridiculous how much of a difference it makes
It fits my natural sleep rhythm better, I can enjoy the sun in the afternoon (which makes me quite depressed during winter times) and I'm much less tired during the day
And yes, it's anecdotal, but most people I know prefer summer time
They enjoy it much more
I even know 3 people who shifted their whole schedule this winter (working from home made it possible) and stayed on summer time since last march
Heard only very positive things from them
And most of Europeans seem to be the same opinion if the last polls are to be believed
I don't fall asleep randomly but I can sleep if I want to even if it's not bedtime and even if I'm not very tired
If I go to bed every time at 11pm I still have no problem going to sleep at 9pm when I need to get up two hours earlier the next day, even though I'm not as tired as I usually am while going to bed
Is that really such an absurd thing for some people
We do not have any active fossil fuel power plants and ~90% of our energy is produced with water
The Austrian Empire along with Prussia were the first countries with mandatory education for children
No matter their sex or social standing
It's one of the reasons Empress Maria Theresia is so well loved in Austria to this day
Austria has one of the oldest civil codes of the world (second only to France if I'm not mistaken)
Austria has the biggest nuclear power plant model in the world
We built a nuclear power plant and didn't turn it on
We have one nuclear power plant, but voted against it‘s activation
One third of our forested lands are protected
We were the first country to strongly reject biotechnology for crops
Every person over the age of 14 is allowed to change their religion without the parents okay
We generate over 70% of our electricity through renewable energy sources
We recycle average 63% of our waste, highest percentage in Europe I believe
> Prison escape is not punishable by law in Germany
Not only in Germany though, I think it's like that in many Civil Law influenced countries
It's the same in Austria, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands, or Mexico
In Mexico officers will shoot at you though
Okay so there is nothing wholesome about germany
Right
Its ridiculous
Although technically speaking, those ginormous halls of capitalism aren't super- but hypermarkets (and even though I hate to admit it, they're incredibly convenient)
I think that only applies to Poles who actually fought in the Haitian War of Independence, not all Poles
That's a wholesome fact if i've ever heard one
That is true
But have you seen French super-/hypermarkets
They are *massive*

1million+ city, really
A cold war era Vienna would be really cool, for example
Or a modern day Berlin
London, Paris, Amsterdam, Rome,... all would have their charms and interesting details to build story upon
Cold war era Vienna could be interesting
It was a hot spot for spies, it has hills sounding and close to other cities "on the other side of the curtain", which could all be part of the same game
london would be boring as shit

In Vienna: [those dudes that stand around in front of the Opera and Stephansdom] badly "dressed up" like Mozart or whatever and aggressively selling "authentic experience" concert tickets for e.g. the Mozart Orchestra for horrendous prices
Lots of people think it's a concert in the opera, when it's really at a random location, with random musicians who play the same 5 pieces every day
Others sell fake tickets
Essentially the look like official vendors because of the uniforms, but really they are black market vendors
If you buy concert tickets, only buy the at the official box office
Or better yet check in the internet on the offical websites of the Opera or the Musikverein etc
The Fiaker carriages in Vienna
Hallstatt
They had put a limit on how many busses are allowed to enter the city per day in 2019 because they have up 900k tourists/year
The town itself has ~750 citizens
We loved the city center but we made sure to sleep and eat just outside of it
The local food (just 15 min walk from the center) was indeed cheap and delicious
Went a few times to praque, but hell yes: cheap beer and the nicest strip bars i‘ve been
Would recommend a rip off 5/7
I agree with Loch Ness, but Edinburgh Castle was really beautiful and worth the visit
I've heard that the Isle of Skye is quite crowded nowadays (before the virus, of course)
There were only a few tourists (mostly from England) when I've been there in 2012
Have been to Rothenburg ob der Tauber with my parents about 30 years ago and I still remember it fondly as being one of the most beautiful towns I have seen in my lifetime
And we have some really nice towns here too in Austria
But Rothenburg
Just wow
Im not a fan of crowded places nor expensive rip offs
But THE oktoberfest is a lasting experience i wouldnt miss
Yes beer and food is expensive, but i usually spend more money for a night in a regular club
So basically the deep frozen paella i can buy in any Austrian supermarket
Which of them woule you recommend
Lots of history happened there, tbh it was kind of worth it
Don't know what a ticket currently costs though
Everyone bitches about Taxi drivers being against Uber, but everyone should be
They pay no taxes and they are horrible for workers
Yes, as a User they are great
Don't get me wrong
And in many places taxis are shit too
But that doesn't make Uber okay
Yeah but it doesn't help that you got the choice between good service which is bad for the driver or bad service which is "good" for the driver
Yeah I know
I spent a semester in Valencia, so I have had my fair share of bad Paellas in overly touristy places
But I also got to know a bunch of good ones there
Also, my gf is Basque, and she has a nose (quite literally actually) for bad restaurants
What I learned about Spanish gastronomy, if a place looks a bit old or a bit shabby or cutre (given that it's not completely disgusting ofc), it might have better food than a super fancy polished place with lots of tourists (that is not *always* true, but often)
In my experience that has been true so far in Valencia, Barcelona, Bilbao, Donostia, Malaga, Ronda (best Rabo de Toro I have *ever* had was in a place called Tropicana; looked very cutre from the outside, was quite nice on the inside and has exceptionally good food and service), Granada, Cordoba
I have been to quite shabby places in lots of those cities, and have been served with exquisite menus, with a presentation of a 4-star cook
Thank you
Which also severely hurts the housing market, yes
Let's just allow child labor in coal mines again then
Because people can always just choose right
Jaja que casualidad
He estado allí en diciembre, y Ronda es un sitio muy muy bonito
Fue muy impresionado de todo el pueblo
Pero especialmente del rabo de toro
Child workers in coal mines once were legal just as well
And just like that is illegal now, abusing your workers should be illegal as wiell
And something being technically legal doesn't make it okay anyway
And what Uber does (Scheinselbstständigkeit) is in fact against the law in Austria, it's just that nobody sued them for it yet
I'm bad at beeing Austrian either
I don't ski, I dislike coffee (never drink it), I barely eat cake, I barely go hiking, I barely visit farms, I only speak a bit in dialect and I don't like some of our classic dishes like Germknödel
- I'm nominally Catholic, but only go to church when I visit my parents in Christmas
- I'm really purist when it comes to eating Schnitzel with lingonberry jam
BUT NOTHING ELSE
- I love sausages, Leberkas, pork roast grease on bread
- I prefer alpine over sea salt
- I like skiing
- I'm bad at football
- I watch ski jumping on TV, when it's on
- I occasionally enjoy very sparkling water
- I prefer swimming in an alpine lake over swimming in the sea, although both are cool
- I complain a lot, but do little to actually change things
- I like beer, but sometimes also like wine
Schnaps is also amazing
- I sometimes wear my Lederhose just for fun
E.g. on election day
- I despise nobles and royalty
- I enjoy going hiking, and get uneasy when I find myself in a very flat landscape
- I drink a lot of coffee
- I'm parsimonious
Except when I'm celebrating with friends
- With my peers I'm conflict-shy, do not like direct confrontation and tend to talk around problems rather then addressing them
However I do mouth off strangers sometimes
- I'm polite
- I like eating sweet things and I enjoy baking stuff like Austrian Christmas cookies or Sachertorte
But only if there's enough rum in it
- It takes years of interpersonal relationship until I have the proper intimacy with another person to call them my friend
But then they are my friend until I die
- I code-switch a lot between a deep Upper Austrian dialect, Viennese, Austrian Standard German and anything in between
It depends on the situation
- I sometimes experience a slight subconcious sensation of disgust, when I hear a person from north of the Main-line speak German
I can't help it, this prejudice is so deep inside of me
I'm trying not to be so judgemental about it
I like coffee, I like complaining about everything and my humor is dark
Am I Austrian enough
Not really, no
I can't yodel and I've never worn our traditional costume
I don't ski or do any other winter sports, and I don't go hiking
I don't like Schnitzel or beer or Red Bull
Kaiserschmarrn and Topfenstrudel are great
>"Polack" is, indeed, used as a derogatory term
I have seen "poorlack" used as an even more derogatory term
While eating nothing but amphetamines and pine buds for a week
Ever heard of a movie called "The Sound Of Music"? I sure didn' til I was 25
On the spot, I can't really think of one where the country of Austria was depicted, but back in like 2016 or so when that Krampus Horror movie came out
oh boy
They got pretty much everything about it wrong to make it fit with the american version of christmas
> to meet the "Basque terrorists" who live surrounded by bananas
Who are also all Mexicans of course, but wearing txapelas, and for some reason they can't cook (which for a Basque must be very insulting)
Well, the US ending with the 2 dudes in „Love, actually“ was probably even more more cringy for Americans than it was for me
Romania should be relieved that the romanian village from borat is portrayed as kazachstan
I liked the episode of the Gilmore Girls, where Rory's rich grandparents have some guests over from the Netherlands, a young girl and an older gentleman I think, and they don't speak a single word of English
As if any upper class Dutch person wouldn't at least a passable amount of English
They could have made them French at least, that would have made more sense
But Dutch
I didn't really get the joke in the scene with Heidi Klum (watched it in English), but maybe this is due to the fact that it is produced for an American audience
Love the impression of the german baddies from pitch perfect 2
they actors are swedish
I dont get why they didnt just get generic germans at least
I thought that scene was super hilarious, with the Red Army Choir in the background and all
Especially because it has the "every Russian guy ever"-actor who is actually from Croatia or so in it
Ah yes, the mighty Alps in Finland
>  or the red and white checkered tablecloth (which frankly I've never seen in my 30 years of existence)
The Neapolitian Pizzeria around my corner has tablecloths like that
Made of plastic of course
And before you ask, yes, it's an *actual* Neapolitan Pizzeria
The family who owns it, is from downtown Naples, and the father was a Carabinieri there for 30 years, and they barely speak anything other than Neapolitan
They even have this weird white clown with the black mask and the guitar sitting on a counter
> I'd like to add Woody Allen's "To Rome with Love", which is a short summary of all stereotypes Americans have on Italy
All of Woody Allen's "European movies" are just long chains of American clichés, and the protagonists are always unbearably snobbish and stuck up upper class Americans from the Upper East side or whatever, who can't deal with the "passion" of their European counterparts
Vicky Christina Barcelona is probably the worst in that sense
It's just a terrible terrible film
Midnight in Paris at least has a creative story and a good message (nostalgia is overrated; kinda ironic coming from Woody Allen, I know)
To Rome with Love, I think, had its funny moments, because it's quite bizzarre in the way the stories are told
I loved the "shower singer" (money destroys the soul of art), and the Roberto Benigni storyline (fame is temporary)
And Alec Baldwin basically trying and failing to convince his younger self that cheating on his girlfriend with Ellen Page is a terrible idea is also very funny
Sense8 has a pretty good international cast, because - shocker - they use actors from tze country they were portraying
And they portrayed the german characters pretty well imo
Jsyk, there's *lots* of unneccessary sex scenes in that show
Based
Also, I love that TV show on eitb where they talk about movies
You always learn something new
Maybe it has also to do with the fact that Heidi Klum is a very unfunny person
> the only other time i can think of where austria was in a big movie was in mission impossible
I can think of at least 2 James Bond movies in Austria, I am pretty sure there are many more
Don't forget The Third Man and Before Sunrise
well he's a jew, so duh
Wasn't the end scene in Grindelwald supposed to be in austria
True
Except for the TV
Almost nobody here had a TV in the 50s.
So I re-watched the scene on [YouTube]
Heidi Klum says that the "yips" is called in German "Ach du meine Güte, nichts klappt mehr, aber überhaupt nichts mehr" (followed by something incomprehensible where I am not sure if it is German or English)
So I think the joke should be that German has rather long words, but this is actually a sentence (something like "Oh my goodness, nothing works anymore, nothing at all
Also this response makes no sense for a German speaker
I only know that a lot were filmed in Vienna, but are supposed to be set in Hungary or Checoslovakia, probably because during the cold war it was the closest location without entering the eastern block
EDIT : I did a bit of digging and the only one I could find was The living daylights
Before Sunrise was pretty accurate for Vienna I think
Except for a few movie cliches I don’t remember any cringy moments
The Third Man is an absolute gem and uses accurate Viennese music
The zither player Anton Karas actually reached the top of the billboard charts I think, and he did a world tour after becoming famous with that movie
Yes it's a Pulcinella
It's because they're homesick, I'm pretty sure
It's not placed super prominently
Neither is their SS Napoli scarf
Anyway, yeah I get your drift
Also, fyi, in Austria lots of places also use that kind of tablecloth, so the association is
well, weak
Also, – not that you were asking – in my opinion it actually is the best Pizza in town, but I literally live around the corner and eat their food about once a week, so maybe I'm a bit biased
They are like theme park rides
It's good fun, flashy, and you don't have to think too much about it
Just enjoy awesome explosions and stuff
It also uses accurate Viennese language:
[Nothing more Viennese than someone shouting out of a window and complaining about noise
My  history teacher in highschool was certain that the reason for the smear campaign on the former austrian president Kurt Waldheim was that Austria decided to help Nicaragua against the will of the Usa
But the  movement, it's arguments and the science behind it would still be valid, no
>I love that one, because if it was true, we'd have gotten really shit at that, given that one of our biggest historic rivals (France) has similar, arguably more, influence than us
France doesn't come close to the internal power Germany has in the EU
France is only very influential in foreign matters
Yeah the Us is a pretty easy target for conspiracy theorists
Cause they don’t get some ?
My handwriting is so bad that it usually becomes an “e”
There are 2 different a's in the bottom example
(in Baruch it's different than in Bernard)
Part of another
Can't think of a neighboring country we don't joke about reclaiming in it's entirety or at least partly
We don‘t joke about that: Dear Italians, we want our South Tyrol back :l
Yeah, many joke about taking back Südtirol, a state in Italy that still to this day has a german speaking majority in almost all of it, despite attempts of "italianization" by Mussolini
Low-key kinda salty still
Weren't these just pranksters in their own free time
:-O
You sure that everyone knows that those are jokes
Haven‘t seen somebody talk about conquering our swiss and liechtensteiner friends yet tho
You‘d rather shove Bavaria over to us lol
Not even the Rhine border
Come on, you can do better than just keeping Alsace
You can pull off a sneaky Kosovo if you're lucky
AEIOU
It's inevitable
Too late, Wilhelm and I are getting the old gang back together
I do too, North Sea Empire sounds way more epic than England and Norway
Stay safe brother
If you don't mind me asking, did you migrate to Belarus for work related reasons
Really appreciate the answer
I'm very curious about stuff like this because people don't just leave their home without a good reason usually
Hope you're doing well and that you guys can find some peace and safety
Edit: And on top of that I've never talked to anyone from Murmansk Oblast before so that's kinda rare also
I mean revolutions probably *are* kinda hard to win
That there are no unions, and its portrayed as being something special and extra if there is one
In austria basically every job is unionized, why isnt in the US
Not including taxes in the prices in a grocery store
(And no, "taxes are different from state to state or even in different cities in one state" doesn't make sense as an excuse
The grocery store doesn't move between states or cities)
No proper lighting (ceiling lights) in living rooms
Carpets
even in public places and offices
The imperial system
Letting private companies run things the state should do
(Like prisons)
Why they elected that clown
mixing sports with military propaganda
I just want to watch NBA, not join the Marines
The lack of Romeo and Juliet laws in many states
A 18 year old from my country was charged for having consensual sex with a 17 year old girl in the US
It's beyond stupid and quite archaic
That the same people who fight for "small government" and don't trust that the government can do anything right want that same state have the right to kill people
The list is long but probably the weirdest to me are:
The imperial system
The obsession with guns
Drinking age
Weird attitude towards sex & nudity
The fact that it's pretty much a consensus among Americans that the USA is the greatest country on earth when it's clearly not the case
>  In austria basically every job is unionized
Since recently even bicycle food couriers have a union
Which I think is great
Gig economy jobs are eroding worker's rights, and it's important that unions keep up with that
And showing prices before taxes
It's not even really an issue actually, if there wasn't this one big misunderstanding: People keep saying "I'm Irish" when they actually mean "I have Irish heritage", because you're used to talking about heritage over there
Nobody has anything against this, and people would even be happy to see that you're so in touch with where you came from (and what you *think* it means to come from there)
But tragically, over here, because we're used to talking about nationality instead, that same sentence would be understood as "I have Irish *nationality*", which is of course a nonsensical statement to begin with, and can feel belittling and insensitive, as if who we *are* was just an amusement park theme to you, something to consumed and put on baseball hats
In short, saying "I have x heritage" is fine
Saying "I am x" is not fine, because it will be understood as "I have x nationality".
oh, they do now
that's good news, especially the "fake" one-person entrepreneurs (that are actually contract workers) need those
We call it toast
Even before toasting it
Never really thought of it as bread to be honest
Related to bread but not really bread bread
It was popularized by American businessman after WW2 and is a supermarket staple
Well, the far right in Austria (FPOE with Strache) didn't come close to 50%. In the last election they had 16% and before that 26%.
But politics completely aside, Strache and Kurz are much more intelligent than Trump
They are also able to form coherent sentences, remember things, read, keep their attention up for more than a few minutes,...
I mean just this statement alone, even without context:
>The president of the United States has the authority to do what the president has the authority to do, which is very powerful
> we’re overall fairly normal in regards to religion worldwide
How many western states have opening prayers in sessions of parts of the government
Americans always act surprised when I say I eat a whole pizza
Yes they have a Kollektivvertrag now
[Check this link for more info]
over here it would honestly be seen as rude
visit my house, take your shoes off dammit
> You can have the same store in different counties (subset of states) and can have different taxes
But the one store I'm physically in is only in one state and one county, even if that chain has stores in different states
They know the tax since they charge it at the checkout
They could, without problems, put that on the price tag
"it happen still signs and wonders", that's nice to hear
In Austria we call that being Catholic
In all seriousness, we do actually have a word for it, "Taufscheinchristen" or "Taufscheinkatholiken", i.e. "Baptism certificate Christians/Catholics".
>  In Europe it’s more about forcibly separating religion from the government and all public life in some cases
In Europe, at least my country, it's removing the influence of religion and church from everyday matter
That's the main point, not the other way round
Given that your concern is that the government is influencing religion and not the other way round kinda proofs my point
The problem I've got with religion in the US is that churches and religions have a huge influence on for example laws, which just shouldn't be the case
>I also find it weird here in Germany too that there’s an official church tax,
Well, it's basically a membership fee, it's just handled like a tax since the amount you pay is based on how much your wage is so this way it's easier
If you aren't a member of a religious denomination you don't have to pay
But I agree, every special treatment of religion and churches should be banned
>and the biggest political party is a Christian Democrat party
And yet you seem to hear more religious phrases from Republicans than from CDU politicians
Trump tweeted "God Bless the USA
" a month ago, now try find a statement from Merkel along those lines
You can get up to three days for death of family members/funerals, your partner giving birth, weddings, and moving house
We don't have it written in law either, but it's in the *Kollektivvertrag*, which is binding for employers and employees
the way the Austrian system works - it's basically law
There might be differences depending on in which sector (= under which collective agreement) you are working
For example I have Christmas & New Year the whole day off; in my previous job with an different collective agreement it was only half the day
Also, we have unlimited paid sick leave which is apparently not standard in all countries
Was that pun intended
Ganz in Austria is a really beautiful City
Most tourists only visit Vienna and Salzburg
They are also really beautiful city's, but overrun by tourists
Last year I visited Graz the first time and was flabbergasted
It's a nice rennesaince town with lots of history and a nice nightlife
Rattenberg
With a population of 400 or so I don‘t think many Austrians even know it‘s a city
I'd say Klagenfurt
It gets a bad rep because it is the capital of the former most right-wing federal state and many move away from there after school because admittedly it does not have a lot to offer to young people living there
However, it's located next to a big, gorgeous lake, there are a ton of things to do as a tourist in the surrounding area and it has a statue of a Dragon on its main square
Bonus: Trieste and Ljubljana are so close that you can visit them in a day trip from there
Braunau
There is no Braunau, there never was something called Braunau
Nobody was ever born in Braunau
Don't ever ask again about Braunau
I believe it‘s very unknown outside of Austria and Styria but Bad Kleinkirchheim
It‘s a very beautiful city for skiing holiday and around here also very popular for that exact reason
Personally, it‘s really my favorite place for skiing
Other than that one no city really comes to my mind that is unknown by tourists
It is
I had my holiday 2 years ago near Siena
I was in Florence and Pisa but Siena was my favourite
To me Rauchbeer tastes as if someone put smoked ham in a keg of beer for a week or so, then washed a couple of old crusty ashtrays in the resulting liquid before finally putting it in a glass in order for me to drink it ;)
But to each his own I guess ;)
I like how you misspelled it in the first mention, so that people won't find it
That's you keep a secret
Right
I loved Graz
It was easy the best homecation we ever had
Pretty much like a smaller and more accessible version of Vienna that has better infrastructure
Source: Living in Vienna and am to Graz every year
Vienna isn’t a bad city either tho
Oh, I agree
I was to Klagenfurt a few years ago and it was really nice
They just have everything there
There’s also mountains that are near the city and easily accessible and I’m just a real mountain fan
And don't ask questions about the new police station
It has always been there, no one of any significance lived in that house
Hah my brain is still in sleep mode, I live in vienna and as Basti said, we don't get up before 12
Completely missed your reply
yes, I tasted it, not a fan ;)
"Eventually" and the German word "eventuell" are false friends
"Eventuell" translates to "possibly". That's still something I have to actively think about when I'm reading a text in English
One interesting German word is "arm", meaning poor but then you have "arm" in English which means the body part
We also have Arme (arms) and Armee (army) but I see where the connection is in this case
I'm not sure if this counts but in Serbian and other South Slavic languages we have "Nocna Mora" (nightmare) and in German it's called Nachtmahr
The English word nightmare sounds similar
In German we also have Albtraum which is frequently used
It's a very specific term
Don't know why those words evolved similar
Gift in German means Poison, in English it of course means „present“.
A funny one is "Hatsch" which sounds like "Hadj" and means a long exhausting (and sometimes senseless) walk
Fun story from my childhood
We were all playing yu-gi-oh and German and English cards were both common
I don't remember which card and how it's special effect was exactly but it was something like "if this is the only bug type card its Attack becomes 1000". We read it as "its Attack increases by 1000". The base attack of the card was 2000 so by our rules the monster's attack was 3000 if it was the only bug type card on the field
When we learned what become really means, the card became (ha
)much less popular
TIL that the widely used Austrian word "Bussi" also exists in Hungarian with the exact same meaning
Like how you say "Johannes" in German sometimes
Based on the saying "Wie die Nase eines Mannes, so ist auch sein Johannes".
In German, the bird is called "Storch". Strong means "Stark".
Not sure, I know that the term is very old and used by older people
my english teacher always told that joke, nice memories tho, now he is dead due to his weight
Well that escalated quickly
Any Moldovans here
I would be curious to know how they relate to Romanian or even Russian news
As an Austrian I have no problems about hearing news about our little neighbour Germany
It´s like with all kids, at a certain time of your life you have to let them make their own mistakes and learn from them
We did our best to raise them and they can come back for a short visit from time to time, but there is no way, they are going to move back in again
;-)
Not really if you don't watch German TV or read German news
Austrian TV and news don't mention a lot of German news unless its something really big happening
Much more about the US than Germany
Our destinctive dialetcs in Austria seem to fade because of the german media that overwhelms us
We get some news from Germany, but it's nowhere near overwhelming
After all, Germany is our biggest neighbor, so keeping up with the situation there isn't a bad thing imo
But you hear much more about Germany than about Italy, for example
In which part do you live
I live near Slovenia and barely get german related news
And I don‘t think the Styrian dialect will fade _that_ easily (but I have noticed that Upper and Lower Austrian dialects slowly (kinda) fade)
Some might say we lost the war, others might say we got rid of a problem
;-)
Yes, they are our most dominant neighbour
But it‘s not as overwhelming as US politics often are
Some do some don‘t. I don't think many people care alot about him
Yes
He was interview by the public broacaster a while ago (he had organized an exhibition in Austria), and the interview was controversial enough for the public broadcaster to immediately distance itself from Böhmermann's statements
[Link]
Vienna
I think there is a tendency for more multicultural areas to loose their dialect more quickly
Oh /: yeah, here the people who aren‘t from around here will adopt our dialect
Eg a brazilian friend of mine already speaks in full on dialect, my polish mom can‘t even speak properly standard german, because she only knows our dialect
Always these rebellious teenagers with their bad music
That german teenager brat is acting up again, it appears
Time for another Cordoba
brb, need to listen to the Radetzky march
There actually is
Pretty much all music from Beethoven
Everyone considers him Austrian besides him being from Bonn
That is our ultimate victory
We made Hitler German and Beethoven Austrian
Well, those people might also even eat their "Schnitzel" with Tunke
So their opinion doesn´t count as they are barbarians
You know
, like the ones who eat "Jägerschnitzel". ;-)
You should stick to the pinnacle of German cousine: Döner and Currywurst and leave good food to the people like us
Saupreiß, damischer
;-)
A nordic state for sure
Once global warming hits hard that'll be the only places still suitable for human life
Either Faroe Islands or Svalbard
The Netherlands
I'm already learning dutch (but haven't studied since a few months due I'm also learning cebuano and this language has more priority in my life rn)
And it might be weird as an Austrian saying I prefer more like not mountainous countries and places (even you have spectacular views on a mountain)
Iceland or Norway
Although English would work just fine there
I like how u listed every germanic country except Austria
And a landscape flatter then ...
Seriously i can't even find something else that is that flat
I'm always assuming people speak German - GERMANS are literally everywhere
In Austria there are a lot of German and French decks
I have seen one of these Spanish decks once
They remind me of what we in Austria use for the game of [Schnapsen] The symbols are totally different, though
In Austria in some regions we use Doppeldeutsche Karten which would translate to "double german cards". It doesn't surprise me at all that other countries have other decks too
Edit: [here's] a picture of a deck
They are from an Austro-Hungarian game, so you are correct in calling them that
Yes, it's a grandparent's game here as well
Let's just say I was happy when my grandma's license was taken away because she certainly was a great danger to herself and others
Sure, it sucks for her to be dependant on others driving her and using public transport but she would have killed herself or someone else in traffic at some point
Too bad she had to total her car (luckily nobody seriously hurt) before
Yes, I think people should prove they are still able to drive every 5 year after retirement
If they fail then maybe give them free ticket for public transport
once you're 60, mandatory driving tests every 5 years, bam
I'd say 50, but if its 60 you'll probably only have to do one during your working time, and will have enough time to do the following ones once you're retired
also makes sense to force people to update their knowledge on driving techniques and new laws, 40 years of "that's how I've learned it and how I've always done it" are another problem that needs to be fixed probably better sooner than later
Do the math, if she doesn't go somewhere daily, and/or only over short distances, even taxis are cheaper than the all-in price of a car (buying price, insurance, repairs, gas, ...)
And most taxi drivers even will carry your groceries in if you ask nicely and give them a little tip
quoting myself ...
> and/or only over short distances
if you live somewhere in the country side it's a different topic of course
> 20 minutes to the city
That's literally country side / tiny village stuff
If you are not _in_ a city you are rural
No matter how close the city might be (and 20 minutes by car is not that close)
Usually something below 10-7 degrees is jacket weather for me, but it depends if it's windy
I d say below 10 is cool, below 0 is cold
Below 10 and rainy is just miserable
5°C can be extremely cold and -5°C can be comfortable depending on wind and humidity
Below ~18 I take a vest with me and wear long pants
Below ~10 i use my jacket (not very thick
Below ~0 I take a thicker jacket
And maybe gloves
But it always depends on the situation
If its snowy I will take different shoes, if its raining I take a rain jacket
And if its much colder I consider taking another jacket
Below 20 I wear a hoodie, Below 15 a thin jacket, between 10 and 15 a thicker jacket, below 10 a coat, around zero an even thicker/bigger coat Everything below is death to me
-10° seems ok-cold to me, everything below isn‘t really for me
My room temperature is 18°
European, Home and the European Union, if you want to count that as one word
If not, the next in line would be History
The Colosseum (in Rome), the EU flag and a Plaza (as in with cafes  and outdoor seating)
A map of it with the most of them labeled
And if I should think of words:
- countries
- languages
- beach
You are true with Christianity, but for me they are away far from Europe (geographically and culturally)
I always include the Northern Caucasus in Europe's boundaries - Caucasus makes a great barrier, as thr sea (yes I know Ural is not really a good boundary)
For me from iceland to the Ural mountains, excluding kazakhstan, to the caspian sea,including the 3 caucasus nations, excluding turkish parts in europe, but including cyprus
South to Malta and west to Portugal
Same here, plus this feeling of home that many here described
You include the Caucasus but not Turkey
Yes
For example: Georgia is one of the oldest european/christian civilizations
'dicke Eier' haben = having fat balls means to be horny for some time already without getting any release
Word by word translated „to have big balls“ means to have big sport balls or something like that lol
that is just to have balls though, no
'Er hat (nicht) die Eier dazu' No comment on how big they are :D
Since words that start with 'th' are old English words these words are usually (always
) the same
dünn=thin, thanks=Danke, think=denken, etc
Oh well, then it is a regional thing :) here it is not possible
it is
Come to Bang for the buck austria ;)
6 is pretty ironic rn
> / 6
That leaves, say, 80% of $91
2 million or $72
9 million
> Here is where things start to get less clear
Personally, I think you should dump half of this, or $36
4 million, into a boring S&P 500 index fund
Find something with low fees
You are going to be constantly tempted to retain "sophisticated" advisers who charge "nominal fees
" Don't. Period
Even if you lose every other dime, you have $638,400 per year you didn't have before that will keep coming in until the United States falls into chaos
Fuck advisers and their fees
Instead, drop your $36
4 million in the market in a low fee vehicle
**Unless we have an unprecedented downturn the likes of which the United States has never seen**, should return around 7
00% or so over the next 10 years
You should expect to touch not even a dime of this money for 10 or 15 or even 20 years
In 20 years $36
4 million could easily become $115 million
Emphasis mine
> San Sebastian
I'd totally buy myself a beachfront penthouse in Gros, next to Zurriola, and eat pintxos every day until I die
I can't think of anything than Petrol which is cheaper here than in Germany
Immobilia maybe too as Germany zonening law is a bit stricter than ours
Rich people can't afford a private jet, you need to be super rich to afford that (in a sustainable way)
Probably the St Gotthart tunnel
Public transport and petrol are the two things
Public transport, internet, mobile contracts, television
Tbh, the bit about treasury bonds is even more valid now than when that post was written
But yeah, generally good advice, except for the timing right now
Sad but true
I'm pretty fucking positive your average Swiss *can't* afford to travel by private jet
I have never voted for a lesser evil and I have never regretted a vote
I can‘t yet vote (next year tho), and honestly, I have two parties I can vote for
One where students and education is their main priority (and I‘m a student) and the other one just because they aren‘t homophobic at all
(Both aren‘t, but there are the other two really big parties that are pretty homophobic in my book
) So yeah, that‘s that, there‘s really not much I can choose from
I voted in my life 4 times until now and I always did it with the belive I vote for the candiate/party which is quite close to my interests
The election were on European, national and regional level
Only found the statistics separately so:
* Male smokers above the age of 15: 18
* Male smokers aged 10 - 14: 2
81%
* Male deaths caused by smoking in 2016: 16
73%
* Female smokers above the age of 15: 15
* Female smokers aged 10 - 14: 3
51%
* Female deaths caused by smoking in 2016: 8
(death statistics are from 2016, smoking statistics are from 2015)
Honestly, almost everybody around here smokes
We’re even called the ash tray of europe
I hate it
Since November there‘s a new rule that you can‘t smoke in closed off public places (restaurant etc), and I love that rule
Everybody disliked it at first because „oh my, **I** don‘t care if anybody around me smokes“ (not really caring about the kids 10 and below having to endure smokers blowing their smoke into their faces
I almost suffocate(d) when my dad did that back then because he either was an asshole or „just for jokes“.) but now it‘s gotten better and nobody complains anymore (:
And i thought having restaurants first build an extra smokers room and then banning that later on was just the austrian solution
Yeah I remember that
For us down here it didn‘t do anything tho except that some people now have little cases for their cigarettes so they don‘t have to look at the diseases or sometimes corpses
Since when are cigarettes expensive in Germany
Was there just last summer and a pack of 20 is like 6€ that's actually cheap compared to many other countries
I also just learned that apparently Austria only banned it with November last year
Weird that we were so late though
My wife is Austrian and all of her family lives here
We met while she was working in America (she had a 2 year work visa) and we agreed that after those two year that we would live in Austria for 2 years then decide from there where we would live permanently
It’s been about 7 years that I’ve lived here
We live out in the western part of the country in the Alps so scenery is amazing
I can see snow capped mountains and a 800 year old castle from my apartment balcony
Overall I prefer it in Austria
I enjoy the lifestyle, security, and work/private life balance here so much more than in America
I also find it a much better place to raise a family (I have a kid and another on the way) which is why I plan to stay here for a while
There are a lot of things that I do miss about America and American life, but when I look at everything, for me and my family, it is better here
I am interested, what are some things you miss
Are they things that could fit into the Austrian lifestyle
I'm glad you like it :)
Well I miss my family and friends greatly
I get to see my parents twice a year and my brother and all my friends maybe once a year
Things like holidays, birthdays, weddings I miss because I’m here
Language is also another thing I miss
I am decent in German and can hold a conversation without much problem, but it’s really hard for me to be funny or to understand jokes
So a lot of my life is rather boring
Making friends here is tough, especially since I’m a bit older (mid 30’s)
Most people here have had the same social group forever and aren’t too welcoming to having new people join in
I have a group of people I hang out with, but it would be nice to have some more friends
Some of my hobbies from America just are not possible here as of now
I always had a fun second car that was a weekend toy in America
Due to costs that just isn’t possible here
Maybe in the future, but with a second kid coming soon it won’t be for a while
I grew up/lived near NYC when I was in America
Damn I miss that city
Things like food that I missed I was able to figure out a way to cook them here as good as possible
Although it is always a treat when I fly over to get the real thing
For friends I could recommend joining a club depending on your interests
People are much more open to you if you do sports together regularly
If you live in a village you could join up with the voluntary fire brigade or local church group as they all organise a lot of events to meet new people
What
I know plenty of guys with multiple cars
Usually it's a daily driver and a sporty old car
I'd say it's actually quite common in young men without kids
>it's shitty for the environment
Not at all, unless you buy new
Not at all
They are all young guys (<26) who took up blue collar jobs
Cars don't have to be expensive
Just buy a cheap old sporty car and do most of the work on your own
Also in Austria you can share insurance for multiple cars
Calling us German
I don't really care personally even though I don't see us as Germans either
Putting sauce on a schnitzel
That's just disgusting
- thinking we're German
- thinking we're Australia
- many petty food elitism memes, like complaining about people who put sauce on their Schnitzel
Austrian redditors act similarly whenever Schnitzel is brought up, and god beware if there's any sauce near that Schnitzel
You should create a sub for it to organize yourself
With r/Schnitzelverbrechen we managed to catch way more heretics than before
Why danes
Pilsner is Czech, which underlines your point perfectly
So basically you were 3 immigrants in a foreign country and one of you got upset over being called an immigrant
Sounds like a Monty Python sketch or something
I've spent a few weeks in Spain before coming to Portugal last year
I had a hard time using the right word, but the locals were very friendly when they corrected me
Wars have been started for lesser offences
That's such a typical Alman thing to say
There's a weekly exchange between both their post companies
Nope
Scandinavia are Sweden, Norway, Denmark
Nordic countries are Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland
In English Scandinavia and Nordic are often used synonymous
In Scandinavia those are strictly not synonymous
Geographically speaking, Finland is not located on the Scandinavian Peninsula
¡Que viven los gabachos
Que viven, ¡en la mierda
It's not like we had much of a choice in that - it was the Allies who pushed for a distinct Austrian national identity in our occupation time, for obvious reasons
And it *does* kind of make sense to have a distinct national identity, considering we are closer in pretty much anything but language to (for instance) Czechs or Slovenians than most parts of Germany ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
> their entire national identity is "not being German"
I see, you have truly grasped the concept of Austrianness
same in austria "so you are basically bavaria, right
" or one simple "australia
which are a different dish and, most importantly, don't have a breaded crust
maybe you guys will learn someday
Because only monsters prefer soggy sad heap of breadcrumbs to a perfectly crispy outer layer
A good schnitzel doesn't need any sauce
AEIOU
Because we're not savages
Do they have it with sauce
Impossible
That's just not done, unless you have only ever eaten in bad tourist traps catering to Germans
As mentioned by someone else, Preiselbeeren are the only thing you could possibly refer to, but that's more like a chunky jam on the side, not a creamy gravy all over the Schnitzel
What they probably meant is lingonberry jam, which is a common and delicious side dish for Schnitzel
But sauce, impossible
It's a German beer sort as much as it's Czech
The city of Pilsen (where it was invented) is in Czechia in any case
Nation of Bavaria and Tyrol when
The only acceptable variation is **Jägerschnitzel** (fr
*Escalope chasseur*) with mushroom and cream sauce
It is NOT supposed to be breaded - everyone who pours sauce over a breaded schnitzel can go die in a hole
Hot Take: Serbo-Croatian is one language
Those countries are closer to most of Austria in culture/mentality than basically all of Germany besides Bavaria
We are more Slavic influenced than people might think
Language isn't everything
It’s war, then
Press F for all of our sad Schnitzel brothers
that sounds like the steak-schnitzel i saw in a german video
the steak was medium rare, complete opposite of schnitzel masterrace
In everyday speech, "Schnitzel" exclusively refers to Wiener Schnitzel
A ketchup am lewakas bringt doch erst den flavor ausse
A lewakassemmal ohne am ketchup is traurig
A trockenes Fleischlaberlsemmerl
Grauslig
Nah that's fine
Sounds good, Austria approves
Tbh, and don't tell anyone I told you, but the cotoletta milanese is the original Schnitzel anyway
Very rarely you can order a Mailänder Schnitzel here, with parmesan in the crust, but I don't actually know whether that's what an original milanese is
Oh yeah that's a Schnitzelsemmel, that's fine
The bread can be a tad dry without
Aaaah okay
Schnitzelsemmel
The bread roll is called Kaisersemmel
That's a completely different thing
It's basically fast food, so some people eat it with ketchup
A Fotzn kaunst hobn
Kaslewakas mit Mayonäs, *des* is da Hit
Food, architecture and history are obvious examples
I'd feel much more foreign in Hamburg than Prague for instance
I agree with the Fotzn, oba Mayonnaise
An Siasn und a Essiggurkal
Yeah it's still a Schnitzel
What was the name of the place
Was it "Schnitzel Kebab König", "Schnitzel Kebab Pizza", "Kebab Pizza Schnitzel", or "Pizza Schnitzel Kebab"? It's always one of those
Prague was also for a long time during the holy roman empire the capital of the Habsburg's since the Kingdom of Bohemia was in the HRE and was a kingdom in comparison to Austria proper which was "only" and archduchy
>i am honestly sorry that i can't wrap my head around Austrians not being a German people when for centuries the emperor of the HRE was sitting in Vienna
If I travel 200 miles in any direction from my city i will meet people speaking about 5 different languages but they will all be rather similar in mindset as they come from the Alpine region of central Europe
I understand what you mean, but  the Holy Roman Emperor sat in Prague for a while as well for instance
And as an Eastern Austrian I don't even see myself as a part of Alpine Central Europe either ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Some time last year I discovered that our national public service broadcaster (ORF) is providing news in [several languages] Mostly languages that were spoken in the former empire
Since very recently (probably because of the pandemic) they have an [instagram account] that provides news in Hungarian, Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian, Czech, Slovenian, English, Turkish, Arabic, Farsi and Austrian sign language
After the crisis
EU: threatens to sanction hungary to get rid of hungarian dictatorship
Karl from habsburg: restores austria-hungary to get rid of hungarian dictatorship
EU: what the fuck
Austria: what the fuck
Hungary: confused relieve
Karl from habsburg: haters gona hate
You either have some very bad sources or are intentionally lying to make Germany look better
>Germany has by far the most ICUs (Intensive Care Units/Critical Care Beds) per capita in Europe
Germany's 29
2 isn't "far more" than Luxembourg's 24
8 or Austria's 21
> followed by Italy on second place with 12
5 and France on third place 11
Hungary, the Baltic countries, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria are all above Italy and France
Luxemburg has actually the second most in the with 24
8 per 100
000 inhabitants and Austria is third with 21
8 per 100
000 inhabitants
You can get a country flair on the right
Oh god, please let it be any other Habsburg/Hohenberg and not Karl
Cannot stand the guy
*breathes heavily in Austro-Hungarian”
Huh, didn't know that Inzko still has the job
Is there no term limit
> Austria is basically Germany
This is SO wrong
It's like I would say Portugal is basically Spain
First, I highly doubt that Turkey has a healthcare systems thats miles ahead of the western world
You either linked me a wrong source or the Wikipedia entry is outright wrong
24k beds for 80 million citizens doesn't add up to 47
1 per 100
000 inhabitants
It was a joke oida
Definitely not that high
Maybe 10-20% or so
I would estimate the % of men sunbathing topless well above 90% though
Vienna at the Donau
quite a lot - otherwise not so much
For my country - Austria - I haven‘t ever seen this
We do however have nude besches and it is not illegal or something - I‘d say maybe 2-7% do it here
Totally depends on the area
In designated FKK areas, everybody
In areas that are not, I'd say it's 5 out of a 100 maybe
20 years ago maybe
Much lower now
Don't forget that this drops to <divide by zero exception>% at all the austrian sea-beaches
Yeah seems to o go down all the time
Austrian salary:
> A person working in Vienna typically earns around 4,530 EUR per month
Salaries range from 1,150 EUR (lowest average) to 20,200 EUR (highest average, actual maximum salary is higher)
This is the average monthly salary including housing, transport, and other benefits
The lowest two Lego sets I found on the offical Lego website are about 79,99€ (a Fiat-car-thingy / I‘m no good with cars, it was just a car and I think it was labeled as a Fiat >.<), and a Jungle Rescue Mission thingy for the same price
The highest I found was the Millenium Falcon for 799,99€. I‘d say the average is 199,99€ for a full set (aka most of them cost 199,99€)
Much higher household capital though than Germany in Italy
If you’d be living in my home for a prolonged time, meaning to be probably alone with my stuff and have theoretically access to my most private documents etc
and/or if I’d have kids in the house like that family likely did I would ABSOLUTELY google you/demand a background check with the institution placing you in my home
I mean, come on
That’s just common sense
Bringing your deceased parent up left field is a bit  much German Direktheit though
Wouldn’t do that
And so is straight out telling you
That’s actually a very nice and transparent move
Personally I wouldn’t tell
> 1) why did they google my name
I’ve never googled names of anyone I personally know, and expect the same of others
Is this normal behavior for a host family in Europe
You never googled anyone you haven't met yet but are going to meet
I don't see anything wrong with it especially if it's about letting someone stay at your place
The second part is a very subjective thing
Could be that you understood the situation wrong, or that it's a different in culture, or that they behaved in a strange way
No way of telling without knowing both sides of the story
>1) why did they google my name
Why not
> 2) even after googling my name, why would they tell me what they did
Can I attribute it to the “bluntness” of the culture
If I ever googled someone, I’d be embarrassed to tell them as it feels like an invasion of privacy (example: court records will appear in google searches)
This family announced it to the group like it was just a normal thing for them to
To bring stuff like that up in a conversation first thing seems rather untactful
But I don't feel like googling someone is invasion of privacy
Courts putting records online is invasion of privacy
I'm currently looking for roommates (via online platforms and groups) and I try to find out basic information about them if they don't write much about themselves in their advertisement
Like, what do they do for a living
What are their hobbies and interests
What are their views about topics like politics, morals, other beliefs and perspectives
Of course, a roommate and a host family is a bit different, but basically it's the fastest way to find our what kind of person you will share your home with
That's really important
For example, imagine someone is gay and their host family is homophobic
Or if someone's wearing a hijab and the future roommate turns out to be someone who hates muslims
Extreme examples, I know, but I guess you get the point
Googling someone in general is not an invasion of privacy, in my opinion
Most people will stop after the first page of google results, or maybe after checking social media
That usually tells you enough, and that's usually stuff that's shared online by the person voluntarily
However, the way they brought it up is NOT okay
That has nothing to do with being blunt, that's just awful behaviour
Sorry you had to experience that
I would probably do a small Google background check
I think that's not uncommon
I would not bring it up, or confront you with the results, though (unless something very out of the ordinary came up)
That strikes me as a bit odd
We are usually very protective about our privacy
Nope it's totally weird, sorry that happened to you
I mean that's your opinion
I see it differently, especially if it's in some kind of business context
I also have absolutely no problems with people googling me and I can totally understand if for example a AirBNB or couch surfing host does it before accepting my request
Old English is very close to old German, therefore I can understand quite a lot :)
I guess "doubt the equivocation of the fiend" means "don't believe the lies of the devil".
Well, I did have courses in university that included the Hildebrandslied
So I guess I have a bit of advantage here, its been a long time though
Well I guess Krampus would fall under interesting story
It was a celtic thing back in the day
Something about evil spirits and good luck for the winter
(Not sure on the exact things it was supposed to do) Well the catholic church didn't like the tradition and tried to banish it
However it was to popular and they couldn't do much
So they added saint nicholas to it and made it somewhat christian
The tradition is still very strong, however mostly in the valleys
In the cities it's just a big show
Now where I am from a pass (the group) consists of 3-6 Krampus (they were pelts so they look and big wooden masks and big bells on the back,  ) one Körbelträger(guy who caries a big basket with trests on his back, is cover in black color(not about race, more about the woods) moss and other things) one Angel and one saint nicholas
Typically the groups just move from house to house in my town on the 5th of December
Nicholas and the guy with the basket + the angel enter the home first
The nicholas gives a small speech and then children say poems they rehearsed
As a reward bad of treats(clementine, peanuts, cookies maybe some other sweets) are handed out
The adults get to drink some schnaps and donate some money to the group
Then as not every was always kind in the last year, the krampus are allowed to enter(this depends on the house owner, some just let one in others none and others all)
The krampus then torments the people inside
Involves rubbing your ears, pulling you of your seat, getting whipped and other things
Then they move on
Obviously they only visit you if you indicate that you would liked to be visited
Also on the street they can whipp you and get you
Now only men can be part of the group (except the angel)
So they say it's good luck for girls to get whipped
And if two groups meet, they "fight" each other (more of body checks against each other)
This all happens in good spirit
And people look forward to that time of the year, it's considered the 5th season of the year
Not so much an annual event per se, but also something with a kinda violent historical background
All federal states in Austria have their own hymn too of course, mostly singing about their natural beauty or landmarks
Tyrol's hymn has none of that and it's instead about a rebellious uprising during the Napoleonic Wars and the execution of its leader [Andreas Hofer]
(Additional fun fact, he was executed by a french firing squad and apparently as his last act made fun of them for missing their first shot
Probably the upcoming national holiday of Austria the 26th of October
It is a bit of an odd holiday as many Austrians get  the occasion wrong that is comemorated
Many believe it is the day the last allied troops left the country after WW2, reestablishing full independence
But in reality it is the date the Austrian parliament passed the neutrality law establishing Austria as a neutral country
Apart from many not knowing what is celebrated, the holiday itself has become more and more odd as time has gone on
Firstly Austria hardly acted neutral during the cold war, having strong if informal ties with the western powers (going as far as building its whole defensive plannimg on beeing rescued by NATO in case of a WW3), secondly since 1991 and the fall of the USSR Austrian neutrality has become irrelevant internationally, thirdly since we joined the EU, the mutual assistance clause of the EU supercedes the Austrian neutrality law
Yeah, the other half goes on other kinds of vacation
I live in southern Austria and used to work in tourism, everybody knew that August 15th was the buisiest day of the year
Because these kinds of things usually are based on some sort of human sacrifice
Well is a [RT interview] an official setting
idk if it counts as official but during one of the debates from the 2016 austrian presidental elections all candidates were asked to answer a question about some EU issue in english and [the rest is history]
She was our former PM and also former European deputee
But don’t worry, her native Romanian was as bad as her English
Her party ended up excluding her from any public positions in the end; I think it’s obvious why
(I’m sorry for the canned laughter, it’s the best version I could find):
From the party and period, she was the minister of labour in the former PM’s cabinet
Here she is addressing the UN:
"Ei vud laik tu wisch wuscha ä mevy kwistmäs"
Gott und Vaterland
We have a "wefachee problem"? News to me
Ah, Überbacher
I was thinking for quite a while but i couldt figure it out thanks
And if you ask me, that very much counts
I straight on died of laughter watching this
Thanks for sharing this gem of a video
They've certainly got an issue
[Like this
International event
You're right
Translation is incredibly widespread in the EU, so if you know you're horrible at English why not speak in your native language and have someone translate for you
Better than making a fool of yourself
Definitely gives off more vibes of the latter
Please help, what is he trying to say
I always thought I'm pretty good with deciphering accents, but this truly beats me :D
Which one of them
"Our movement"!!! Oh my god :D :D Thanks so much for sharing this gem
Antisemitism in general - I am not talking about the holocaust, the hostility against Jewish people didn't just come out of nowhere during the Nazi regime and in central Europe it unfortunately has a long history with constant persecutions and massacres
Even many Habsburgs were fervent antisemites, such as Maria Theresia
Also bad man with moustache
Well, for Austria it's probably the support for the nazi regime
Even though austria is regarded as the firs victim of nazi aggression, the majority of austria probably supported them and wanted the anschluss
Hey
The moustache guy, was actually
Never mind
No one outside of Austria is regarding us as the first victim
This myth was constructed by Exiles to get support for an independent Austria after the war ends
Sadly some people still believe this lie up to this day
Its really eary to read Austrian and German newspapers of the time cheering on these atrocities as "good christianfolk exterminating red rats"
>And for Germany the next most fucked up thing
You didn't say Austria, but I´ll guess you meant us as well
Well, the k.u.k did a lot of fcked up shit in the first world war
Burning down villages, executing thousands of civilians because they suspected them to be spying
They did this in occupied areas and in the homeland
WW 1 & WW2( Hitler was austrian)
besides that 30years war ( I know it was the holy roman empire at the time but Habsburgers were ruling
For Austria:
The first fucked up thing is the same as the Germans
the second fucked up thing for Austria was WW1
&#x200B;
The atrocities of the Austro-Hungarian army in Serbia seem to be almost entirely unknown nowadays
It lost like a quarter of it's population in WW1
Hitler didn't invent national socialism and race theory, and wasn't the only influential athor on those topics
*Something* awful along the same lines would have happened in 20th century Europe
>There's the old debate whether structures or individual figures are more influential in history
I think it needs an existing "structure" in order to allow individual figures to take over
IOW: Without wide spread pre-existing racism Hitler would have not happened
But: Without Hitler the consequences might have not been that terrible
&#x200B;
That's probably the most interesting alternative history timeline to me
What would have happened if Scheidemann doesn't proclaim the Weimarer Republik, and Liebknecht's Republic is the first one
How on earth is german of all languages the only one to not have created a word for this so far
Wait I heard Wochenendmelancholie too somewhere but I can‘t pinpoint where
Edit: All of my german friends did too
I think it‘s just an official unofficial word
This is a very local thing, but every year on the first day that the sun sets before all work is done/closingtime and artificial lights have to be turned on, the owner of the business will invite his workers out for food and drink
It's called "Liachtbratlmontag" meaning "light-roast-monday"
Today there is a fixed date its celebrated on, I think its September 29th
in austria we still have krampus, who was reinvented by the church but was a celtic tradition to scare away the bad ghosts
A happy Viennese
I cant ski
An Austrian or, even worse, a Tyrolian that isn't able to go skiing or snowboarding
Actually that is me and I feel like an alien
An Austrian who doesn‘t like skiing or hiking
Austrian here who can't ski and hates Sachertorte
An austrian who doesn't like schnitzel or drink beer
An Austrian who doesn't eat Schnitzel every day
An Austrian never complains, but I guess this applies to the whole balkans and east Central Europe
an austrian who doesn’t like skiing lmao i get  j u d g e d
A friend of mine (french) is allergic to wine and hates cheese
Does that count
Haha, you almost fooled me
An austrian that actually likes germans
An sober Austrian not complaining about anything
An Austrian that doesn't ski
An Austrian that likes neither skiing nor soccer
An Austrian that doesn't like Schnitzel
An Austrian that is not complaining
Also historically: Austrians that are not in some way antisemitic
Damn even our Jews hated on Eastern Jews
Wow
I'll tell you buddy if we ever meet in the morning I will very rudely refuse to wish you a good morning and not even acknowledge your existence
My granny is an Austrian tourist claiming the best pool spot at 6:30am
She always complains that she didn't get good spot because all of them are taken :D
A Greek who pays debts
I had to
Know plenty of those, especially since tickets have become so expensive
Nah, that's just me
That's me
I'm vegetarian
That would be my mom
(She is Hungarian but always complains about foreigner Jews in our district)
What gender do The Sun and The Moon have in your language/culture
I mean the Earth's Sun and Moon
In German it is "Die Sonne"(female,the sun) and "Der Mond"(male, the moon)
A quick wikipedia search later, I found out the Germanic Moon God was Máni (of course there are more/different ones too) and his sister Sól/Sunna gidess of the sun
So I think this has a big influence
I think in English one thinks of the moon as female and the sun as male, when personified
For me the greek/roman/hellenic(?) influence and their male sun gods and female moon godess always felt vaguely not right
Especially when learning latin and translating
Edit: if one of them is neutral, how is it depicted most commonly ?
Oh that's cool
Thanks
Oh that's fun
Oh thanks for looking into it
Seems like there was a lot of roman influence in addition to Germanic/Celtic
Oh okay
I think it also depends on the person, like don't you refer to it as Luna (poetic sense) and if English speaker make moon characters they are often female from my observations
Oh you are lucky that you never had an argument over the gender of Nutella
Oh that is interesting that the sun is neutral
Is the sun ever thought of as male or female ?
Oh that sounds like a plausible explanation
Yes,  that sounds right  I never new that the sun was neutral in many languages
Oh that is interesting
Are your dialects so different from the standard version that they ads a gendered prefix or suffix
That is an interesting point  especially about the man in the moon
Could that be that romans brought the female godess but celts had a male ? Anyway thanks for the idea
Oh okay
Es gibt so ein Meme/Witz das sich niemand einigen kann ob es das der die Nutella heißt. Manche sagen sogar  der Nutella
I think that too, but I have heard people say Dss Nutella so
Okay, thanks for the answer
Joghurt und Butter geht's sehr ähnlich
Das sind regionale Unterschiede
Oh hab der und das verwechselt
Ja, absolut
It is treason then
Das Joghurt, oder ? I just had do go trough all pronouns and all seems right
Oh God I hate this language
Das Joghurt, du Unhold
Das Joghurt, Piefke
Ahahhahaha hab mir schon gedacht, dass das ein Österreicher Deutschland Unterschied ist

For more information, please visit r/aeiou or [Wikipedia] The short stoy is, anything before the first world war
When we still had sea access :(
I often hear, other than the time Mozart and all the other important musicians lived around here, that during Austrio-Hungary and under Habsburg was the golden time of Austria
Along with the K&K monarchy
I partly agree with that, personally I think just politically now is kind of better than the rest of our history, because we‘re finally independent and neutral
But they didn't have defenestration back then, so something was definitely missing
Guess you're referring to the brown age
I feel like your golden age is right now, Germany is thriving, economically and politically one of the defining forces of the EU, under reasonable and stable leadership
What's not to like
Oh how i miss you Trieste *sobs*
Taking the submarines for a spin on the Danube is just not the same
Ngl these times were shit
I for myself truly love democracy
I was looking for this
Elae i would have made the post xD
I approve
also: TU FELIX AUSTRIA NUBE
( You, lucky Austria, marry
part of italian history yes whereas it being  italian is debateable same the HRE being a part of austrian‘s history but not being austrian
Jersey
It rained the hole week (yeah could have expected that one)
We had a tourguid and i now think the island is made out of 70% churches, 29% ww2 bunker and 1% some flower thing, he gave us like 30 min for the flower thing cause the next buncker was so important even though it was the by far most intresting thing (and that comes from someone who doesn't care for flowers)
The food in the hotel was bad, like really bad
Yes england isn't known for good food but i was eating way better on the main island
The food in other places around the hotel wasn't much better
One example: The fish and chips shop some hundred meter away managed to make fish and chips that had more oil then fish, i literally could have made like 5 portions of fish and chips with the oil from my fish and chips
The area isn't anything special, the "capital" doesn't really look good and the rest of the island are just potatofields
Not even the cliffs that many say look beautiful look in any way intresting
I literally don't know why anyone would visit the island and the shitty hotel made it worse
Not exactly a horror story, but I was visiting a friend in Berlin and we planned all kinds of cool things and places to go, etc
etc
I took the train there, which was mostly fine, except that DB missed a connection, but I could take the next train without much problems
However, this was all taking place March 12th to 15th of this year
Flying back from Berlin was weird AF, because I was basically checking the news every few minutes if I were even allowed back into the country without being forced to go into quarantine or some shit
This measurement went into effect a few days later
Also, on the flight I was sitting next to some coughing old men first and luckily the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move up two rows to an empty row
Thank good, you kind Easyjet stewardess
It was still a nice trip overall, we spent some time day-drinking at the balcony, which was nice and all, but still, we had a lot more stuff planned that we didn't get to
I've been to Rome, Barcelona, Paris, London, NYC ... several times
I'm not a very careful person
The only places I've ever been mugged were Tokyo and Vienna, two of the so called safest cities on earth
It's weird
And this is why you don't send two rookies together on patrol, but pair each one up with an old established officer
> They got it back but I don’t know if they paid for it
They did
Instead of accepting the demands, they counter-offered to donate 52000 packages of cookies to different welfare facilities
The thieves accepted and the cookie was then found, tied to the horse statue in front of Leibniz University with a red bow
A few days later Leibniz made good on their promise and announced a lottery for the 52000 packages of cookies
Social service and welfare facilities could enter the lottery if they wanted cookies
The winner(s) were decided with a drawing
I don't know how many winners there were, or how many interested facilities in the first place though
This happened in Austria a month ago
A "similar" case
Ah the vagina train
Didn't some redditor who works at ÖBB post a photo from inside the cockpit
edit: [Found the post]
Not going to tell
Living in a highly touristy area, I'm 100% not going to tell the internet about the places and especially mountains that are not absolutely overrun
I haven‘t been to Salzburg often, but every time I was, which was about during tourist season, the city wasn‘t *that* overflown, which is a shame considering how beautiful the city is
The tourists are often only the house of Mozarts birth, but there‘s also the rest of the city which is soooo beautiful
I was in the Salzbergwerk Hallein and would go there any day if I had the chance
(Ofc not really something for people who dislike tiny spaces/rooms
Otherwise my favorite place for skiing is Bad Kleinkirchheim
It‘s so nice there and overall really great
I also really like places like Kufstein, Wörgl and many thermal baths in Styria
(Is Neusiedlersee underrated btw
Idk)
Anyway, I‘m not sure if any of those places are considered underrated if you consider that Austria doesn‘t have as many tourists as eg countries like France and Germany due to our country usually being quite unknown overall, excluding Vienna
That's the Austrian spirit
One hint for potential tourists: if you want a nice hike, make sure there's no cable car going up that mountain
Even then it can get crowded
Just look at Traunstein, Kleiner Sonnstein or Schoberstein
You're not guaranteed a quiet hike, that's for sure
Chances are higher, though
I know the mountains in lower Austria much better, and Rax & Schneeberg are for sure the most crowded ones
German and French in my opinion
With those languages you are ready for France, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland
Also many people in eastern Europe have German as their second language
Bonus: With those languages as basis it's also easier to learn Italian, Spanish, Dutch or Luxembourgian
Spanish, French, Russian, or a slavic language can be extremely useful, because, well, Spanish and French are two of the most spoken languages worldwide
And I think Russian is one of the languages of the UN
I just said maybe one slavic language because, unless you‘re in/from a slavic country, not that many people speak slavic languages, or at least that‘s what I think/notice
German, of course, is also a great choice if you‘re going to work in Europe, because it‘s still the most spoken first language in Europe, so I‘d definitely keep that up
> because of the size of the German economy
+ Austria
+ about half of Switzerland
Please don‘t be ashamed to speak a language
I guarantee you, almost all Germans know how much German sucks as a language and will understand that you may have problems learning it
But still, it‘s best to speak in the language you‘re trying to learn, because it‘s the best practice
As a Styrian I‘m also kind of surprised that nobody really spoke English where you went
Did you only speak to folks 35/40 and up
Because then yeah, it‘s quite rare to find anybody speak English in that age group, but below it‘s quite common
Also, I think it depends on what kind of Styrian you were encountered with and what region you went to (according to my german friends normal styrian is easier to understand than old-styrian or, god forbid, *stursteirisch* - which even many Styrians can‘t understand themselves :‘D)
But nevertheless, I hope you had a pleasant experience in both my country and my federal state, despite our (sometimes very) weird dialect
Yeah, on the countryside it might be that people have more of a problem with speaking English, but in cities or villages near cities it‘s very common to finde people below 30/35 or smth to be able to speak english very well (for one because of tourists but also because they‘re more likely to have a job in a big company that most likely requires some kind of basic english skills)
I've learnt that not all countries have personal identification cards which blows my mind
That's weird coming from an Austrian, since barely anybody has an  ID card here
You are cancer
I have one, since I did not own a drivers license for a long while and a passport is jusy too chunky to have with you every day :)
Woah I just checked on a map - I never realized Kazhakstan was that close to ukraine
Makes me want to go on a roadtrip
Fine, how about an austrian-led German state this time
You northerners had your chance, it's time for some real schnitzling
If you make a Wiener Schnitzel and then put sauce on it, it is no longer a Wiener Schnitzel
He had German citizenship by the 1930s. Surely you're not saying a foreign born individual can never be a true German
Adolf Hitler probably
Gavrillo Princip
If you take Hitler out of the game, there isn't really a historic person that comes to my mind
Modern day criminals like Fritzl or Priklopil are fare more present in peoples minds instead
Josef Fritzl probably
As sad as it is but thats not true
When I team up with Romanians in Counter Strike, I somehow always ask them what they think about Ceausecu, most ofnthe time they say that they like him and that he was a good one
Why is she so hated by Scotsmen
Everyone mocks him but i don't  think many people truly hate him
Björn Höcke must be hated by more peole than til schweiger is
Easy to hate him for a lot of things, but i liked him in "Knocking on heaven's door" (though that movie hugely benefitted from Jan Josef Liefers) and also "Der bewegte Mann".
I guess he's just a typecast and not really all that different in any of his movies
He killed Hitler, how can you be mad at him
You're right, how could I forget about the best General that the Empire had ever seen
But what did Franz II
do that makes him hated
Is it because he "ended" the HRR
I either talk to them about politics or if they have ever stuck their penis and testicles behind their thighs and pretended to have a vagina in front of the mirror
Ouch
Totally understand, didn't know that that fucked up neoliberalism hit Scotland so much harder than the rest of UK
Grammar is doable, but with lots and lots of hard work
Accent, I don't know
Usually, if you don't learn languages from a young age on, it's almost impossible to get it perfectly right
Even though you're really, really good, natives would probably still notice that you're no native yourself
But that's true for any language
Everything nightmare level
grammar and stuff like that is hard but doable
dialects otoh are impossible to learn
not even Germans can do it
some think they've mastered it, but they're not fooling anybody
there is always some giveaway and natives can spot dialects and place other Austrians in a certain region within a couple of words
I met some non natives who speak German fluently
Never met anyone without an accent though
Depends
We have a Dutch football trainer in Austria, Frenkie Schinkels, and he has quite the accent
Everybody loves him though, and his accents is very funny
[Here's an example of him speaking]
[Here's an example of him starting his musical career]
It should at least become a common option
Maybe not the standard yet, but an option
The company I work at switched from 40h/5 days to a 36h/4 day policy in March
Unfortunately this doesn't apply for me because it's not compatible with the contract I have at the moment, but holy am I looking forward to the change in a year's time
We're still kinda figuring out what schedules works best, but so far I'd consider it a positive change
Just a thought:
With things as they are you have to work 60+ hours
I bet your boss/management says they can't afford to hire someone so you don't have to work 60+ hours as it is
With increased demand however they'd have to hire someone
And suddenly you're not working 60+ hours a week but both of you work 40+ hours a week
Also obviously I don't know much about English law but 60+ hours a week sounds like something from the 19th century that can't be legal anymore today
Depends on the company
In my current company if you need something to be done, you better hope it's not Friday
The productivity on a Friday afternoon in many departments is inexistent
Also having worked 30h before I freely admit I am way more productive per hour back then
Jobs in a creative environment, like marketing agencies sometimes already pay full salary for 32h.
Of course that doesn't translate to every field
A factory owner needs to compensate by hiring more staff
A restaurant owner will need more staff
There's also jobs that aren't classic 9-5/5 days a week like farmers, nurses, etc
-- but those aren't really affected by the current system either
When Austria introduced the 40h week (from 48/45h before) salaries weren't reduced
So the total income stayed the same
It has worked in the 70s&80s. I do reckon some things changed since then but it's not like it hasn't be done before and was proven to work
And honestly I've worked for business owners who paid their workforce less than what an Uber driver makes, who claimed they can't fix broken office chairs because there's no money and then went on at the company Christmas party to throw around with money and brag about all the sports cars and real estate they bought recently
So my compassion for some of them is limited tbh
Thank you Germany, for always taking the blame for my country
Thank you Germany and France for getting over their old animosities and rivalries and finally teaming up
The French-German friendship is a factor the whole continent thrives on
Thanks Germany and Switzerland for having bigger and more qualitative media outlets that can do and do do investigative journalism about the jucier bits of the corrupt machine that is Austrian politics, whithout fear of financial losses or otherwise any retribution (keyword "Ibiza")
We would be truly in the dark without you
Thanks Italy, especially the towns along the old "Austrian Riviera" (Jesolo, Grado, Triest, Caorle, Lignano etc
) for putting up with our hordes of drunken tourists every year
Thanks (not the countries, but actually the people) to all those women (99% *are* women) from the east – especially Slovakia and Romania – who come here and take care of our old people, 24/7 for weeks en bloc, for shitty pay, under shitty (pseudo self-employed) conditions, with no labor organization backing them, in a strange country with a strange language and strange laws, far away from family and home, and enduring chicaneries of a xenophobic and neoliberal government
If any of you reading this are one of those women, or know one of those women, know, I am sorry
You people are seriously underpaid and mistreated, for work that is *absolutely* essential, and it's a shame how you're well-being is nothing but a playball to party politics
I'd like to thank the allied countries for kicking Nazi-Germany's ass
Thanks leader of germany in 1945 for killing hitler
> Also thanks Finland and Austria for maintaining their neutrality
This is more important to us than you think
Putin likes to make that pretty clear whenever he talks to Austrian media
Also thank you Sweden for harboring Kreisky, the best chancellor we ever had
Germans and Austrians understand each other for the most part
And then there's Vorarlberg
Interestingly for me it's somewhat easy to follow my Dutch friends talking, probably because I found out for myself that Austrian German and Dutch have some pretty close pronunciation patterns and similar words
E.g.: Dutch "niet" and Austrian "net" ("not" in English/ "nicht" in German)
Though my Dutch friends can follow standard German easier
I can understand dutch and swedish people a little bit
Not often, maybe once a month at most
If Trump does something big or something in relation with Germany, France or the EU then it‘s 100% talked about
Otherwise not really
Edit: On TV
On the newspaper in international it‘s almost daily
Austria here
We got you in our news almost daily and it's 90% about *The Donald*.
Well, right now your country is all over our news due your president claiming us to be of the Ewok race, but also with exploding trees
Trump just told everyone we have "forest cities" and "more explosive trees", so at the moment, a lot because we love to see our country mentioned, it's not a regular occurence outside of documentaries about the Nazis
But even without that happening, I'd say fairly frequently, if not every day then certainly every other day that US is on the front pages
It's always been like that and it's fine - your country's actions have the biggest impact on the world so naturally, the news outlets will focus on it
> Hopefully when Buren is president we will get less
[Martin van Buren] is making a political comeback
Color me surprised
It's really fuckin hard to avoid the shitshow of epic proportions that every US election is
Doesn't help at all that it goes on for like two years each time
Yeah, that's what it feels like
And even during our elections, I start to get exhausted by them by the end of it
Of course, I'm politically active, so there's quite a bit of running around and handing out flyers and what have you, but still
Two months is plenty
People don't forget who you are
So where's the big giveaway
;) #spoiltByYoutube
Looks like you spent a fortune with a professional design agency on it
Identity does not necessarily have anything to do with a common language and culture
An example: when the Austrian Empire collapsed, the country no longer had an identity
The economy was down and people had nothing left to be proud of
Many even wanted to join Germany
But after the Second World War, things changed radically
Today, Austria has a very strong identity
It came into being in the post-war period through many different things that have reunited us
An identity can emerge anew at any time
And as Switzerland proves, even different languages are no obstacle to a common identity
The EU can definitely go the way of Switzerland
And I think it will happen all by itself
Maybe not in 20 or 30 years
But possibly in 50 or 100
I think Europe is not a nation, but Europe is the idea that it is possible to live together in peace and in democracy and to leave behind the history of millenia of war that this continent endured for a prosperous future
Now that i am writing this i notice that this is kind of similar to the federation in star trek lol
i have to say yes, i believe in european identity as an austrian
austria had the lead of several countries from prussia to italy, from spain to romania when the hre still was a thing
as an austrian, i can connect several occasions from different countries all around europe into important historic moments for austria
even the fall of austria-hungary was a historic moment that took place in bosnia and herzegovina
we had an habsburg monarch as the leader of spain, the royals from gb, prussia, france and russia were related to austrias emporer
as an austrian, i always had the european identity in me, considering how important it was for austria through its whole history
also, i think we are at the verge to get one universal language, since we are all using the internet, where everybody can talk to everyone in english
and we see it with the younger generations, that english is becoming more and more use in the daily activities
it will start (or has started) simple with english words getting a meaning in german, which will get "eingedeutscht". since those words, which are obviously english, are now official german words, there will be more people who use other english words in a german sentence
its this weird english-german mixup language, that also exists in different other languages
we call it denglisch
it will be our launching pad for a universal, mostly english focused language
somewere else where you clearly saw this development, was when gb was leaving eu
we suddenly didnt have the english speaking country in eu, but france and germany (and several other countrys) agreed to use english as their universal language in parlament (instead of forcing everybody to now learn france or german)
those are little steps, but they are part of a clear path, to unite all of europe
We are all humans, I don't need anything else
All the other stuff is just man made bs
I think your "mixed salad" describes really well the motto of the EU:
"in varietate concordia" - united in diversity
Hallstatt in Austria
If you’ve seen that one photo everyone takes of it online, then congratulations you’ve already been there
It is small, super touristy, and there isn’t much to do or see there
There are a bunch of other smaller villages along lakes throughout that region that while touristy, don’t feel over run
I'd say Café Central and Café Sacher in Vienna
Seeing people queue up these (admittedly beautiful) cafés is funny to me
Hallstadt
But thats because no place, ever, is worth the hassle of working yourself through the sheer mass of tourists this place gets each and every day
And tbh, you kinda have to do it when you're a tourist
Hallstatt
It got to the point where the citiy had to limit the amount of busses allowed to enter the city
The Gardens around Blarney Castle are pretty nice thou
Do you mean to tell me that McDonald's in Ireland doesn't sell alcohol
I've been once
We took the last train home, because its really just a moneydump
As a Salzburgian, I gotta agree
But thats just one of the two cashcows
Mozart and Sound of Music
Endless amounts of money flowing in from these two tourist magnets
There is a lot more stuff to do in Salzburg that are way better experiences
And can you imagine how surreal it is for us now
No tourists
In summer
Just the oddest sort of calm and relaxing
If you're interested in classic musicians, I can really recommend the Esterhazy castle in Eisenstadt, in Burgenland (east)
It's where Haydn worked, and his birth house is very close as well :) My mom works there, so I've pretty much grown up there
It's really lovely
Honestly I loved Paris, but that's probably because I had no expectations
Me and my mother just split up from the guide and discovered the city on our own (we both speak French well enough to get along)
As every big city it has its shady places, but the adventure was what did it for me
We try to go every year to see what changes since our last visit
Its nice for like
one night
Check off all the sights worth seeing and then go elsewhere in France (or Europe, whatever)
At those prices, that must've been one hell of a joke
They get 1 million visitors a year, which means around 2700 visitors a day
Germany, of course
But not the other way round
Some people here really hate Germans
I don't even know why
In my experience, the Germans like us a lot
I would say Germany
They're kinda Austria's big brother, so there's always this rivalry
For example, when the german football team (Who usually plays very good) lost against Austria's team (Which doesn't play good at all, to say it nicely) everyone made fun of the Germans
It's probably also because we are culturally very similar, however almost no austrians identify themselves as german, so we have this kind of rivalry to be "seperate" from germany
It's kind of a love-hate-relationship
Balkan love triangle (it's complicated)
fuck that overweight guy in the north, we're the true rivals
Switzerland is basically just Salzburg with a better tax haven
I think all of the german-speaking countries (Austria, Germany, Switzerland) have some sort of rivalry with each other, because we are ethnically pretty similar, but all of us want to be seperate from another
Kinda strange love-hate-relationship
Is that one of those one-sided rivalries
Maybe we austrians are just too focused on the rivalry with germany
Am I not understanding the balkans right or is it really more of a polygon
I mean the Balkans seriously seem like a free for all
Well, there is much arguing, but most austrian people accept that south tyrole is italian
But of course there are the obligatory monarchist who think austria should get it back and we should be a monarchy again etc
, but those area minority, a loud one though
[nah]
I don't really think so
Ok, AH prevented the region from getting unified under local rule, but other than that, they weren't much worse than any other cultural supremacists in europe
probably because they couldn't.
even so, I am not AH
>This isn't a comparative issue, btw
It's just Austrian history leading to WWI
What do you mean by that
No, they usually pass out while having a cig and set their room on fire
But the two drains are standard here
Goddamit, Finland at it again
Haven't seen it in a shower I think
Also never heard of someone passing out while showering
I've never heard of something like this
In the shower
Bathtub yes, but never seen two drains in a shower
Wow that's dark
usually it's hidden behind the knob for closing the drain
According to r/Austria, even people in Vienna felt it
Southern Austria, I felt it lying in bed
All the best to you guys in HR, stay strong
Apparently my roommate felt it here in Graz, Austria
He thought he dreamt it when he woke up until
he saw the news
I have a ridiculously deep sleep, so didn't wake up
hmmmm
fuck
Mallorca away from any “Ballermann”Locations is actually stunningly beautiful
The City of Palma, Soller, Matala, St
Elm, Andratx, the Tramuntana mountains
you really miss out if you have been to Mallorca and not seen these
Same with locations like Ibiza and Bali, that are whole islands
also, Dude
Lloret de Mar is a city, Thailand is a country
Perspectives
Agree, Dubai was a terrible visit
Boring, everything artificial and you felt caged
Never again
I think Barcelona is an excellent location, unfortunately way to many people share that opinion
For just beach and sun there are really better places but the history and culture is really nice
I also loved those annoying sounding parrots that are all over the place
It seems to be quite the location if you are looking to purchase cocaine
Locals as in not the staff at the hotels, they're often paid to recommend certain restaurants
It is brutal, but don’t worry, the air conditioning is cracked to Eskimo literally everywhere so you for sure get sick when you come home
Depends on the people I'd say;) A lot of people go to Thailand for the monuments, the general culture and the beautiful nature’s scenery
I know a bunch who went there solely for bike trips, something which I consider strongly myself once this Covid mess is over .
China and Japan are great
Honestly I also would love to visit North Korea
There is a trip where you start in Vienna, Austria and go to NK through Russia and China
all by train, including the famous Transsibirian
- that’s on my to-do-list for quite a time now:)
Shouldn't trust, it's better to ask locals outside the hotel
It was really terrible for circulation
The interesting story would probably be pushed quite down on my reasons list, it’s actually the unique time-capsule state the whole country is kept in plus I am a huge fan of certain 20th century aesthetics, that are met in a country like NK
Also in Mongolia
Ulaanbataar's Stalinist Brutalism architecture is famous
You don’t go to the beach or the pool per taxi, you walk around outside in the city at places/a park/a trip/whatever at some point or you are on a terrace
if you aren’t belonging to the race of Mole People you sure want to see the sunlight at some point and not solely be confined to the hotel-mall-restaurant circle
German: Stuhl - chair
Austrian German: Stuhl - human shit
German Stuhl is a chair, Russian стул is a table
Even worse that a chair is стол, it always makes me think for a second
Ambulance (correct translation: Rettungswagen)
Ambulanz (ER)
Labor (correct translation: Arbeit)
Labor (Laboratory)
Gift (correct translation: Geschenk)
Gift (poison)
Also (correct translation: auch)
Also (so, as in "so, what now
Probe (correct translation: untersuchen)
Probe (correct translation: rehearsal or sample)
See in German means both Sea and Lake
Arm in German means both Arm and poor (adj)
Typical case of a word with the same root, but semantically it developed differently in both languages
It comes from geben/give
A gift, as well as poison is something you *give* someone
In German this old meaning is still preserved in the word *Mitgift* (dowry, literally "with-gift")
> "Dick" in German would be "thick" in English, whereas "fett" in German would be "fat" in English
Those are the cognates, yes
Semantically those words are still not the same
"Fett" has a much more negative connotation than "fat".
Ahahaha, let's just say it was a typo
No no it's not a false cognate
English gift and German Gift *are* cognates
They used to mean the same thing, 1000 years ago (or whenever, idk exactly)
However after that the meaning has taken a different path in German (towards poison), while it has stayed close to its original meaning in English
This is for me the biggest giveaway to sneakily differentiate between Austrians and (Northern) Germans when they are speaking English, or even a very very neutral standard German
Because Austrians as a rule don't have a voiced s, and it's pretty hard to learn it and consistently and correctly use it
You can unlearn other "Austriazisms" when speaking standard German or another language, but the voiced s is always one of the last things that to keep
Oh I misunderstood then, sorry
I love living in Austria
We do have problem of conservative mindsets and corruption, but the positive things are more dominant
We have beautiful nature, mountains and lakes, decent cities and overall good healthcare and education
I work in a foreign country with a lot of different foreigners and when we talk about our homes I'm glad that I live in Austria
Well, I made the conscious decision to move here so yes, I like living in Austria
Yes, I really like it and I wouldn't want to live in another country for the rest of my life
It's save, we have a good health care system and free but at the same time good education
We have beautiful lakes and mountains and lots of interesting history and culture
There are quite a lot of conservative people here, especially on the countryside, but in general we are becoming more and more open minded
Austria isn't perfect but I do think it's one of the nicest countries to live in
I am from Spain and I have lived in Germany: in Saarland and Hamburg, whereas I literally hated Saarland, I fell in love with Hamburg
Germany is a pretty nice place to live if you don't mind the weather and people being super scheduled and mostly refusing to be your friends unless you can speak German (again, this is my experience)
Weather sucks for the most part
Cities are super clean and supermarkets are open quite long
For the past seven years I have been living in Austria and man, I have super mixed feelings about this country
I have been wanting to leave eversince I arrived and here I am  there are plenty of jobs here, payments are pretty decent and also social plans such as maternity and sick leaves and all those things are very well managed and as an employee you have many many rights
They are also very well organised but not as tight as Germans I would say
However, they are super proud of being Austrians and of their food and nature and traditions, which for me as a Spaniard is a bit confusing because I am not used to that sense of belonging
And if you don't like outdoor sports you are most likely to be the background friend because everybody does outdoor sports here
People are really nice and warm and social
I have never felt lonely whatsoever
Opening times of supermarkets and stuff are too tight and chances  if you work longer than 6pm and are stuck in traffic you won't make it to the supermarket
And the weather sucks
Bro I would love to go back to Spain or Portugal or some warmer country
Would you rather live in your own country or somewhere else and if yes, how many
In general i like it pretty much, except for the climate
I think would really be a little bit warmer, especially in the winter
I wouldnt mind moving to southern italy or so because i really love the culture and the weather there
(or i just wait for climate change to happen, then i might also like the temperature here)
Summer
In Iceland
*presses X to doubt*
>I love living in Austria
We do have problem of conservative mindsets and corruption,
Although Austria was always somehow split regarding conservatism
We are quite conservative with technology on the one hand but relatively liberal regarding sexuality
Prostitution is legal, we have a rather low age of consent and practices like BDSM are not forbidden (actually we don't have a current legal status because there are nearly no cases which were judged) which is for example forbidden in Switzerland
Also we have a green president
Edit: I agree on the corruption problem though
If you need to save money to move, just 50 pounds a month can help you cover the costs in a few years
No need to stay desperate, you can do it if you put your mind to it
If you find a job abroad they might be able to help you move too
Yeah you are right, I think it's the pornographic depiction of it or something alike, or a certain degree of violence which is allowed in Austria but not ion Switzerland
Austrian here
As another Austrian stated: We miss the sea or direct access to it
So, dear Triest, wanna come back home to good old Austria
;-) We  could give our relationship a new try
We promise to be nice this time and we won´t cheat on you with that Germans again
I have never heard of any single person who would have travelled from Vienna to Lake constance to go on swimming vacations there
A tiny itty bit of access
And don't get me wrong, Lake Constance is nice and all, but an ocean it ain't.
I mean historically you and the Swedes fought a lot but after losing Skane you became irrelevant
Just imagine being in a coastal town and all the people are Austrian
feels kinda weird in my head
Don't say that
If Boris reads this, he'll want to tow Britian westwards
thanks, i hate it
Don't ever go to Lignano
It *is* fucking weird, and embarassing
No offence, but Denmark still lost consistently for over 500 years since the Kalmar Union was dissolved in 1523 (guess in 3 years you can celebrate the fifth centenary beginning of the downfall)
And I am gonna make a case for it, right here, right now
First up, your "possessions" Greenland and Iceland weren't worth much, were they
Both islands had small populations, whose only worthwhile export was fish and whaling
For Norway it was similar, the only real revenue came from ore mines in the mountains
Schleswig-Holstein was a decent province if you actually had full control over it, but it was largely ruled by nobility and the king had limited influence until he was able to secure leadership after several bloody internal wars
After the loss of Skane every external war Denmark participated was a loss or a costly stalemate, which is all the worse because Denmark often was the attacker in these situations
1658 Skane was conquered, in 1814 Norway was lost, Schleswig in 1867 completely
During the era inbetween losing Skane and losing Norway Denmark waged so many wars that failed that the state was on the constant verge of bankruptcy
Not to forget Denmark sold its only Caribbean possessions in 1917
The only "win" I can see is that Denmark reunited with (the worst) parts of (Northern) Schleswig in 1920 after a war they didn't fight in
In 1940 Denmark was occupied by Germany and Iceland was occupied by the British
1944 the latter's independence was declared
After WW2 Denmark had two remaining oversees possessions, Greenland and Faroe Islands
Both are nowadays largely politically autonomous (I wasn't able to find any data on taxes and subsidies to the territories so I am just gonna assume that most taxes are retained locally and Denmark subsidises the territories)
The Faroe Islands have so much autonomy in fact that they are an equal member of the Nordic Council and operate representatives in both the UK and Iceland
With Iceland they have a united economic zone
They are so autonomous the assembly could declare independence tomorrow and largely nothing would change for the island
Similarly situated, Greenland is completely internally autonomous and can also boast an equal membership within the Nordic Council
All the resources are property of Greenland itself and not Denmark, while Denmark is stuck with meeting defence requirements
Donald "the Orange" Trump would call it a bad deal and it is one as Denmark has withered to the smallest size its ever been since its inception
You might counter that with the EU Denmark has achieve unmatched prosperity, however I state that this is the case for both large and small countries and has nothing to do with the miniscule size of Denmark today
Don't take my comment too seriously, Austria also lost all its power, but it was a stab instead of a wasting away
>You're pretty much right about everything the only thing i will add is that we did actually win the war against Sweden to get Skåne back in the 1670s. We had it, but then Sweden got their ally France involved who told us to give it all back again
Must sting when your only ally falls you in the back and makes a separate peace with France
>And of course we technically won the great Northern war but I agree that we were pretty clearly carried by Russia
We barely did anything and for that reason we only got Slesvig-Holsten back
Skåne stayed Swedish
I just read how Sweden knocked Denmark-Norway out within a year and only through the bloodthirst and hubris of Karl XII's defeat at Poltawa was Denmark brave enough to reenter the war
Also the "win" of Holstein can barely be described as such as the land only became independent as rebellious dukes switched to Sweden in the first place
I have only lived in Austria for three years but I don't plan on moving back to Germany anytime soon
I love Vienna, it's the world's most livable city
Why would I leave
Well my friends get a little amused when I say things that only exist in Standard German
Then I remind them that we invented the language they are bastardising
And of course I laugh when they say weird things
It's all in good fun
Not my country but Medieval Iceland had "to drive the Elves away" as a funny way to say that
>Don’t ever use that in an actual conversation though, lol
you ain't the boss of me
For some reason, a lot of German cities have really funny names
next to Essen and Darmstadt, off the top of my head I can think of:
Gelsenkirchen - mosquito church
Pforzheim - fart home
Düsseldorf - retard village (kinda)
hey you can't quote the whole thing in one comment, depriving people of building it up in a comment tree
that's against the *rules
* (great song tho)
sometimes also "funny because racist". never heard of the concept of an inappropriate joke
I got another one for you:
What's the difference between a truckload of bowling balls and a truckload of babies
The truckload of babies is easier to unload with pitchforks
The Niva, called Taiga here, is popular with hunters
Other than that, not really
Not exactly but they were well respected for being rugged and easy to fix
Moskvitch on the other hand are still joked about for being small
I am a hunter and this is new to me
It‘s Suzuki Jimny all the way
I think the Urban was an attempt to "SUVifye" it, it had more "stylish" exterior like different bumbers
But yeah, they change the name every other year, I think nowadays its called Bronto, but in Austria funnily it's called Taiga since ages
Well it's used in light woodlands here mostly
I'm seeing it very often here in Styria and in Burgenland
Also never seen a Jimny, mostly the older Samurai
Here in Upper Austria a lot of hunters drive around in Ladas
AFAIK even some employee of Bundesforste has one with ÖBF Logo on the side
It's mostly just "Lada", since it's AFAIK the only model sold - or at the least the only one that's somewhat present
Yeah, people call it just Lada, because the other doesn't sell well
But I've meant the official Name given by lada is 4x4 Taiga, were in other countries it's called just 4x4 or Bronto
My first boyfriend was french and he didn’t take his shoes off in the house when he came over to have dinner with my family, and then proceeded to talk about how great french wine is and that wine from Vienna has a weird taste that he doesn’t like, etc
And then he proceeded to tell my mother that her food was too heavy, and asked me why I was not fat at the end of dinner
My mother forbid me from seeing him again, and then decided to set me up with a guy from Russia two weeks later despite the fact that I was still in a relationship with him
Complete disaster
An englishmen asked me what my favourite light-beer is
I don't even know where i could buy such an insult of a beer in austria
Once a group of Brazilians came to Austria for a joint project with the automotive company I was working
They stayed a couple of weeks and were really friendly and outgoing guys
They decided to go out one day in the city and asked about shady placed to avoid at night, so they dont get into trouble or robbed
I couldnt think of one dangerous place
Disclaimer: i live in a 300k town where the worst you can get into is a nice offer for some narcotics
Who would do that
In Austria, they usually stop for pedestrians to cross
Not everybody, of course
But it's not like in Istanbul, where I even had green light and still couldn't cross safely
Obviously I had the reverse experience when going to places that don't put pedestrians as much on a pedestal as it is being done in Vienna
cause quite a few angry people honking at us because we just started walking
Of course we felt sorry and were aware we had to adapt , but at the same time I couldn't help but think, Yeah tough luck, if there's people on the road, you get to wait
I think I like how Vienna does it
!!! Thank you, it is absolutely repulsive and I find myself completely disgusted with this as an adult now
And my mother, to her credit did not have an aneurysm with he walked on her carpet with them on
You can say that, but he basically insulted her country, her mother and her home
I am unsure if he could have done more to anger the parents
I have an eastern background but I have since learned that westerners do this
Still, it shocks me when I see it and I am unable to understand why people do such things
That is really, really funny
I feel deeply sorry for him as it sounds like he had a similarly painful experience, haha
Some Restaurants had at 6:30pm "early bird" menues when I was visiting, used that much
My condolences
should've just told him to go back to the entrance and take his shoes off
that's what I would do, honestly, don't care if you're the president, if you enter the house, take off your shoes dammit
He also said that Austrian cake is 'dry' and 'bland'.  I am just glad my mother didn't chase him out of our house with a knife
interestingly, over here that's a distinctly working class thing
Holy shit, that's unreal
I hope your "womanly instincts" have matured since then because that guy seems to be the antithesis of a good son in law
My father would kick someone so impolite out if my sister ever brought them home and he tolerated a lot of shit from her boyfriends
Adding to that: maybe it was also a misunderstanding about what "meeting your roommates" entails
There's a huge difference between "we'll get together in the evening and maybe have a beer and talk a bit", and "we all took some time and assembled everybody to hand you your keys and have you sign the subrental contract".
I'm totally with you on this one
Over here, eating dinner before 18:00 is only done if you're in a hospital or below 5 years old
How do people not get hungry afterwards
Yes, I metaphorically kicked him in the face and I have not/will not ever date someone from France again
No, he was quite charming but I later learned that he had another girlfriend still in Paris so it was not meant to be
Lessons learned
Why would you want a snack in the before the main meal of the day
Ruins appetite for dinner and shifts dinner on a time way to late to properly digest to sleep well
Don't have to go far to get a different experience honestly; even here (which I would argue is a place that in general is quite "smiliar culturally" to yours up North) things work differently
If I had to explain it, I'd say that being a bit late can feel like the more *dignified* thing to do
It really depends on context though, and there's of course situations where you better make fucking sure you're on time (best example: appointment for a job interview)
But in a more intimate setting among friends, it can come across as stiff or tactless to be totally on time, sharp
Maybe because you didn't anticipate your host's needs for some extra preparation time, or because you don't show willingness to discern between a friendly and a professional setting, basically saying you feel with your friends like you'd feel at a job interview
Same for leaving – I can't tell you how often I had to fight the impulse to feel offended when I stayed in Japan, and people honestly started packing up and leaving at the indicated time
Back at home, that's when things start to get comfy and interesting, and leaving then (exception: if you have some other important appointment, of course) is a bit like saying you don't really want to be friends, because you'd rather go home than "change your plans for us" (which were no real plans to begin with, because everybody already *expects* to stay longer than planned anyway)
In summary: It has of course nothing to do with different levels in politeness, and everything with adhering to what's *expected* that people would do; and it shows that *what* is expected of them, can differ greatly between cultures, and can be hard to know if you didn't grow up there
Sorry wasn't meant in a derogatory way at all, I just noticed the difference between the place I'm from on the countryside (paying whole rounds is a kind of one-upping one another among younger males there), and how it's never done among a student crowd in the city
Figured it's because a) they don't have enough money and b) use other things than money for dick-waving contests, like telling you about all the places they've been to
Yeah, it's just different concepts of what's allowed, and how people are expected to behave (see my [comment] above)
No difference in respect or politeness levels, just different things that are perceived as polite or respectful
agreed
It's fine, I was a stupid teenager and it happens
I wish it was more common to openly state your intentions when you are on a date/getting to know someone, because I think this would solve many, many problems people have today
And thank you
Do you mean 6 o clock at "afternoon"? I'd call that evening
Anyways, if also people in Italy are hungry by that time, why put a bandaid on instead of go to the root of the problem = have dinner
Haha right; don't wanna be a *pesado* after all
[Hatschi Bratschis Luftballon]  (Hatschi Bratschis air balloon)
It's a very famous book for children in Austria
It's about the young boy Fritz who gets kidnapped by the Turkish wizzard Hatschi Bratschi who steals children with his hot air balloon
Spoiler:
Hatschi Bratschi falls out of the balloon and into a well while trying to abduct more kids
Fritz is alone in the balloon now and gets attacked by a witch which in the end burns to death and gets eaten by ravens
Fritz flies over the alps, first to Italy, then to an island where the people eat humans (which are portrayed by stereotypical black people) and then to Turkey to rescue all the already kidnapped children
The end
Edit: since the 1960s it has been criticised for being racist and parts of the book have been changed
For example the cannibals are now normal monkeys who just attack the balloon
I loved the story with the thumbsucker
The tailor with his huge scissors is drawn so dynamically and swift
Always when I her the word "flink" I imagine that tailor
The anti racism story in there is also great
"Well, you kids always made fun about the moor
I dye your skin with ink, now you are even darker as him, that serves you right"
The Little mermaid is also pretty dark in original variant
Spoilers: She didn't get the prince and the only way not to turn into sea phoam is to kill him which her sisters urges her to do
She couldn't but instead of dying she turned into s wind ghost/silph as "reward"
I also remember that mermaids shouldn't have souls and the only way to get one is by being loved by a human
Ah yes, good old Grimm's tales
Disney tends to leave out all the good parts
Also, TIL the Czech names of Hänsel und Gretel
You should read up on the real story of Rapunzel
It has has pretty fucked up parts:
Rapunzel is named Rapunzel because her mom had some serious pregnancy hunger flashes and wanted some rampion salad (Rapunzel)
Her husband got it for her – from a witches garden
In exchange he has to promise the child to the witch (I mean, of course)
The witch puts Rapunzel into the tower, because she is such a beautiful child
The prince then comes and "visits" **the twelve-year old girl Rapunzel** in her tower (climbing up by her hair), after he had heard her sing
It is the very first time in her life that Rapunzel sees a man
He continues to "visit" her, and brings her pieces of cloth every time, so she can make a ladder and get down herself
But when the stepmother-witch gets wind of that, she cuts off Rapunzels hair and banished her to some wasteland
When the prince comes the next time the witch lets down Rapunzel's hair, and the prince climbs the tower, and is frightened
The witch tells him that the girl is not here anymore, so in his grief he jumps off the tower, and falls into a bunch of thorny bushes
**The thorns cut his eyes out, and he is henceforth blind**. He somehow roams through the world for years, blind, and full of sorrow
Until he hears a beautiful voice one day
It's Rapunzel **and her twins**, which apparently she got in the meantime (remember those "visits"?)
They reunite, she cries, her tears drop on his eyes and he can see again
I always thought on a dark clothed man, like the typical thief/burglar
Is she invited in the original story
I remember her having to wander the earth doing good deeds to finally go to heaven
Also the author was a devout Lutheran, so the story was more deeply Christian in general and less „Catholic“, whatever that means
I even know that ballad, it was interpreted to a pretty popular song by the German "medieval rock" band In Extremo (and also is featured in the first Gothic game)
Ah yes, I remember that one
Root of many spooky and dark stuff is the 30 years war which wracked havoc on the land and caused hunger and desperation
Or an would just stand on the sidelines until everyone is  beaten by putin and then pull out a glock and shoot him
What was a misunderstanding that only happened because someone grew up in a drasticly different nation
I talked to a dutchman who lives in austria for years so he knows the region
During the conversation he ask me which village i am from and i said the name
He reacted with: the one over there 10 min away from (other village) up that one mountain
Me: yes that village is nearby but there is no mountain near us
It took us 5 min to figur out that our definition of a mountain are drasticly different
What are your similar stories
@allDutchPeople
I'm really generous when calling that 700m "mountain" a hill
I used to work as a server at events, anything from weddings, business events, expos, anything really
Usually for the evenings we would have a selection of one red wine and one ehite wine
Now working these jobs in Germany, what we served was mostly German wines, often produced in our own county (Baden-Württemberg), but sometimes from neighboring counties (i.e. Pfalz) or somewhere else in Germany
However if I got asked whether the wine was local, my answer would very much vary depending on who asked
For an American, anything pretty much produced in Germany I'd call local
For a German however, especially if they are from this area, I'd distinguish whether it was made in our direct vicinity (around 50km radius), our county or further away
But then again, we had different stuff at every event and I was never allowed to taste beforehand, so if anybody had any questions I'd usually make up some bullshit (for those who obviously had no clue and wanted to show off in front of their peers) or sent my manager to talk to them (for those who obviously knew a lot more about wine than I did)
It's the somewhat literal translation of German "würzig" ("spice" = "Gewürz"), that's why many German natives confuse the meaning
Ask them if they like it "scharf".
It's weird how different words for tastes can be
There is no good German word for "savoury", for example
You should probably call your jalapeño-infused food "sharp", to not cause any misunderstanding :D
I'm probably more stupid than you, I don't even know what hurling is
In the city: if it's less than 20 minutes by public transport away, or you can walk there, it's close
Outside the city: Anything with less than one to two hours driving necessary is close, anything above that is far
Honestly, the lack of a commonly used word like "forenoon" is one of the things I struggle with most in English
Morning just feels too early, like something between 6 an 9 am maybe
After that, and up until noon, it's Vormittag dammit
Not quite
It's similar (and used as such sometimes), but it's not the same
There are lots of savoury things around that are not very herzhaft
Pikant
Not really
Take Rindsuppe: it's definitely savoury, but you wouldn't call it *pikant*.
Deftig
Would green salad be *deftig* to you
No, but also not savoury
I give up :)
Plain grean salad with vinaigrette *is* savoury
And yeah, there isn't any good German word for "not sweet". Take that, people who say German has a word for everything ;)
tbh pikant is used in *exactly* that way, with the meaning of "opposite of sweet".
I was born and raised in a small village in South Tyrol, a formerly Austrian region in northern Italy
While I did feel at home, I always felt a bit different
My dad's Austrian, so my surname was atypical for the region; in primary school heritage was really emphasized, everyone knew their family back to their great-grandparents or further back and had at least 1 cousin attending the same school
Meanwhile, I had no idea about most of my more distant relatives and many of the closer ones lived many kms away
(Though in hindsight I'm glad I dodged the incest bullet :D )
Also, regional patriotism that has its roots in the napoleonic wars was pushed, especially by older teachers
Never understood that either
Their narrow-mindedness and focus on their roots may have helped to keep their cultural identity alive after becoming part of Italy, but they've long been granted wide-reaching autonomy rights, so it really feels outdated and out of place by now
I live in Austria now and feel much more at home here
Yes
My valley is extremely rural and traditional
I’m currently studying in the next big city and it’s astonishing how much more open minded people are here
Many people in my valley think it’s the most beautiful place in the world, and yes, it is beautiful but most of the people who say that have never even left Austria
Depends
Austria has a real bad reputation of being Xenophobic, which I‘m 100% not
But with the younger generation this seems to slowly fade-away, so it might just be that
Along with the anti-LGBT stuff (two of our three biggest political parties are against LGBT-marriage (I think it only has been made legal recently, like 2018
)) and, well, I‘m in the LGBTQ+ community
However this also seems to fade because we have pride parades in every federal state, I think, and the younger generation seems to barely care about wether you‘re LGBT or not
I wouldn‘t mind living in Switzerland tho
I kinda love Switzerland
Germany I wouldn‘t like living in so much but wouldn‘t mind either
Edit: I do however love that Austria has such a wide range of nature along with history to it and I absolutely love our culture, festivals, traditional clothing etc etc
I wouldn‘t move to another country just from my free will
May I ask what the social norm on Greece is
Like, religious, traditional and conservative or is there more to it
Do you speak another dialect or do you speak standard German
Can you maybe relate to Thüringen, Sachsen, Hessen, Baden Württemberg more or not at all to German culture
The thing in South Tyrol is, you can also get good italian food
That's one thing they do really well
Oh okay
From what I know German federal states are all pretty different, especially Bavaria because even Austrians often think it‘s more Austrian than German (mindset, tradition clothing, dialect, etc etc), so I thought maybe you could identify with other states
I still hope you‘ll be very happy with where you are and who your are tho
No problem, you deserve it <33
We have the highest Alcohol consumption in the world, its weird if you don't drink
What I've noticed is that the more reserved a country generally is, the more ballistic people go when drunk
Stray dogs
I remember when I was a kid, I had to know the dog-free areas of my city to get around and not get bitten
Now there are hardly any around
Unless you are walking in a remote area (like old railway tracks, disused factories) you won’t encounter any
Honorary mention: old Dacia cars
Sounds similar like the cigarettes here
As an 8yr old my mom used to send me to get cigarettes and there never was an issue, they always sold them to me
When I started smoking at 13 I never had problems buying cigarettes
Today there's huge, huge fines on selling cigarettes to minors
You don't have free public toilets in the UK
No skin on the fish is a great loss, my condolenses
Mebel is super similar to German Möbel, some dialects would pronounce it like that
I think it‘s better to have the fines than get cigarettes easily tbh
I‘d rather have a hassle buying cigarettes for my dad when the cashiers know my dad is (almost) behind me than knowing I, as a minor, can get cigarettes easily
I'm happy with 'love', but a waitress recently called me "my love" and that was a bit startling
That was in Sheffield, and she was fairly young
free public toilets are disappearing here too
Oh certainly
It was incredibly stupid to start smoking so early and easy accessibility helped with that
These fines should have existed much earlier
Sadly, investing in public toilets in France is not something I expect beyond perhaps more optimised (i.e. discrete) pissoirs
The only ones I've ever seen are from our local cult of crazy, founded by American "missionaries". Sadly, my parents were members and I had to grow up with that shit
It's all stuff like "Have you accepted Jesus in your life
" and "Prayer works".
We had one prominent billboard on our german border which said "Grüss Göttin" which translates to Greet Goddess, which is a comon greeting form in german but with God instead of Goddess normally
Other than that I don't think I've ever seen one
Religion is a very private thing
The Catholic Church has done PR campaigns in the past, but that was nothing like the stuff you described
More like "Hey look at us, we're not all old farts or rapists
Here's some slightly younger and vital people smiling
Please continue to pay our membership fees
And organisations that are somehow related to churches, e.g. charities like the Catholic Caritas, the Protestant Diakonie, the Catholic Dreikönigsaktion (little kids dressing up as the Three Wise Men, going from house to house around January 6th, singing carols, and collecting millions of euros in donations for projects in the third world), an others also have PR
But that Evangelical shit is a very fringe thing, and they are very quiet
There's a big banner saying "Jesus loves you
" or something like this on one of the churches, but other than that: no
Our law makers also don't start their session with a prayer
Never seen one
Most billboards I see are about food (aka like 95%)
Never seen huge things like that
&#x200B;
What is somewhat common is a newspaper-sized thing near a church door (on the wall or some sign post etc
), where the have information like the time for mass and confessions, plus some picture with sentence like "Never forget, with his infinite love and compassion, he died for us all" or "Giving to people in need will yield the largest return"
There is a famous one in Vienna
Near the area that was formerly used by many street hookers there was one stating "There is one that loves you, Jesus Christ". on a church wall
It has become a bit redundant when the city forced the women to relocate to other areas
Not only do they want your money, it's also a pretty easy way of making people do whatever you want them to do
Wait, not everyone gets their own personal Jesus
Someone to hear their prayers, someone who cares
Idk if it counts but Standard German
Like, we technically don‘t speak Standard German, we only speak in Dialects and Austrian-German
Other than that: Dutch
It‘s quite easy to read, probably because it‘s so similar to German
Still couldn‘t ever speak it or translate word by word
Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are also understandable to some extend
Like, I can guess many words because they‘re so similar to German
(eg
Huskat or Kat/Katt/Katt - cat/Katze) And if I see a sentence with the translation next to it I can easily guess wich word is supposed to be which
(eg [norwegian] God dag (?) - Guten Tag)
I can perfectly understand written German from Germany, even though they use some funny words now and then
But the farther north you go the more unintelligible it gets
As an Austrian I'm able to read Dutch, although its hard sometimes
German
No one speaks it here, but we easily understand it when reading (just kidding)
Dutch and Luxembourgian would be two of them
Just asking: How well do you understand polish
I have a polish friend and I understand some polish too due to my mother being polish and if he or I speak polish my Hungarian friend sometimes understands a word or two
I think they do - at least Austrians have very much a clue when reading dutch and every German in here says dutch
But I think we can’t understand it as good as the Swiss people
I'm slovak and that's exactly how polish sounds to me
like a toddler making up his own words :D
>Kazakh actor
Sacha Baron Cohen is a Brit
I'm slovak and i don't understand shit in polish :D I'm fluent in Czech thought but that's probably because we were still a single country when i was a kid and we didn't really have any slovak tv channels for some time, only Czech
i wonder how is it with kids nowadays if they understand Czech since our countries are a bit distant now
also i have some experience from recent years when i tried to speak slovak to Czechs and they looked at me like I'm speaking klingon :D so i rather speak Czech when in Czechia
the culture of 'sudern' (=complaining about everything)
Daytime drinking, and events that dress up as cultural or national holidays or festivals so everyone is fine to daytime drink
Festzelte, Kirtage, Food Festivals, Music festivals, Christmas markets etc, etc, I'm looking at you :D
One word: Oida
It can be used in basically every situation
The EU wants to stop us though and they started to tax us even on tiny homemade amounts
this could also be austria
Second that
Well, it is not something I ever experienced abroad, at least not to the same degree
Considering most people don't live in a house, there is a huge reliance on public spas if you wanna go to sauna
You have to pay before you distill
I mean if you don't count semi-detached houses as houses then you're right
Otherwise the EU-28 average of people living in flats is [42%]
was about to write a suder-answer about how everyone here is sudering all day long and that it's not even debatable, when I realised your comment was meant as a joke, and I perfectly fit into the Austrian stereotype lol
whoops haha
Yeah but shared Sauna means it's not only for you hence Corona might cause people to use it less
No license needed
You want to distill x amount of mash, which will turn out to be ~y litres of pure alcohol
You pay taxes on every litre of pure alcohol you will get
[Wurstsemmel]
Käsekrainer
Leberkässemmel
Probably the "Leberkäsesemmel". It's a bread with meatloaf inside of it
Well, I don't eat those, but many Austrians do
Fuck yeah, just had some a few weeks ago and they
are
off
the
hook
Not to forget Schnitzelsemmel, Bosna and Kafka
Bosna
Kaisersemmel -
it is not a fast food (but you can put a cold Schnitzel in the Semmel instead of Wurst making it a Schnitzelsemmel)
Käsekrainersemmel
Not really a thing
Hahaha
Yea
Lüneburg
It is not odd, but just not that wide-spread
I would think that this person is having conservative or right wing political views or they bought it for an international sports tournament
Depends on how it is displayed
No, but it's not too common
Usually found with people who don't have too much else to be proud of
If I see someone fly an Austrian Flag I automatically assume they are right wing or at least conservatives
It\`s sometimes seen in the countryside but I have never seen one in the city I live
&#x200B;
Also, is it weird that I have an EU Flag on my wall
What do you think about that
Same in Austria
I am on the political left and I like the country
I am very happy about being born here and I value the opportunities that were offered to me highly
With all its flaws it still made me, me
I think it's a bit of a pity we let the right folks occupy the flag
I like the top comment in this thread by the danish guy, that it's just a neutral statement that is used by everyone and not just right-wingers
>  displaying a European flag is the counter to this and can be used to neutralise the negative association
That's why I found my new home there
Only on the national holidays, it's usually the municipals which decorate the streets and public buildings with it
Not really
If you count soccer tournaments
then still no because we usually don't make it into them
Only government owned buildings do
The few people who do flag their private homes for national holidays tend to be the uber-patriotic kind
Only on public buildings, if
The action of showing pride of your nation through symbols is somewhat tainted by history in Germany and Austria
It just has a 'wrong' feeling to it (assuming you're not far right)
I bet lots of Germans and Austrians of my generation (early 90s) know exactly what I mean with this feeling
> We use it for private celebrations too, like birthdays
That would be so weird in Austria
Or on their trucks
Eh, I don't really see the point of taking pride in nationality
If I'm gonna be proud of something, it's gonna be an actual accomplishment of mine, not being born within an arbitrary set of geographical boundaries
The way I usually hear people phrase it (me included) is that they're glad to be Austrian, rather than proud
(Some people, that is
A lot of Austrians would rather cut off a limb than be caught offering anything but complaints about Austria
I think for Austria it‘s actually something really unexpected: [Hermann Maiers crash in Nagano]
I guess every Austrian knows this picture
> My personal favorite is a collection of photos by Bruno Barbey that shows Poland during the 80s. My heart clenches everytime I see the photo of the grandma at Auschwitz gates
These are incredible
Some of them look like they're from the 1880s and not the 1990s. Incredible to see how much progress has happend in just 40 years
> (google translate tells me this is the translation but it sounds very weird to me)
Better source for such translations is to look it up on wikipedia and switch languages which leads to (Austrian) State Treaty (or use a proper dictionary like leo
org or dict
cc)
[I think you meant this image
[Also, we should never forget this one
I had [this] in mind, but you're probably right
Mhm actually I know the other one, but I don't recognise this picture
This makes me feel proud of my country and our public transport
For Norway it's special that the king took the tram in 1973, here we have weekly posts of the president in a tram or the metro
> or use a proper dictionary like leo
org or dict
Those are user generated internet dictionaries
I'd say a proper dictionary would be Langenscheidt or Pons or OED or whatever
Which isn't to say those internet dictionaries are bad per se
They are very practical, but sometimes not as extensive as you'd like them to be
Source: studied English, have used my fair share of different dictionaries
Another tip: Wiktionary is a great user generated online tool for etymologies
The non plus ultra for etymology semantic history of words in English is the Oxford English Dictionary, but you need to to either pay for it, or a VPN from certain Austrian unis (Uni Wien for example)
So if you need to know something quickly, wiktionary is where you wanna go
That wikipedia trick is fantastic though, I usually do that when I want to know the name of a plant or animal or something specific like in this case the Staatsvertrag in various languages, because it also features a picture
Your both right
Both are iconic images
I'd also add [this picture] to the list
November 12th 1918, the proclamation of the 1st Republic in front of the Parliament in Vienna
[I had that one mind
The Austrian Republic was reestablished on April 27th 1945
The state treaty reestablished Austria as a fully independent country and ended allied occupation
The last soldiers left the country on the eve of the 25th of October 1955, part of the British forces
On the following day the parliament passed the neutrality law, an inofficial concession to the USSR for their agreement to the state treaty
The only thing i can think of is that we are to small of a country and therefore market for a lot of the biggest companies to care about us
Luckily we have Germany as big neighbor with the same language so we can leech their stuff
Without that we wouldn’t get dubbed movies, websites, operating systems and so on in our language
Other than those first world problems i really can‘t complain except on pricing of real estate maybe
Question: How rampant is corruption in small things over there
Does it start at a "you have to bribe that policeman or that small government official" level or is it more of a "the ones on the top will split things up among themselves".
Because that's how I think it is in Austria: trying to bribe a policeman
Have fun in court, cause you will be in deep trouble
Make sure a buddy will get a good contract while letting it appear 100% legal
Yep, that's the Austrian way of corruption
Ditto on the money department
same everywhere in europe basically impossible for students coming from out of the city to get their own apartment without payment from parents, neoliberal goal achieved
Is het zo erg
Ik ben er alleen maar 2-3 keer per jaar en woon de rest van het jaar in Oostenrijk
Ik vond altijd dat Nederland het schoonste land van alle was
You're already the second Swede I have seen on Reddit to complain about this
Having lived in Sweden, I agree that it is hard to do things with people spontaneously
However, it is quite similar in Austria imo
You often hear the typical "I can't do now unfortunately, but what about next week
Yes, I'm very grateful to live in Austria and basically exploit Germany for all the germanized things
What I wouldn't give to have our own language, so we could watch movies the way they're intended and not with all characters sounding like they're from Germany
Luckily there is a cinema in my city that plays all movies non-dubbed
>The lower wages, compared to some of the neighbouring countries, for educated people and the omnipresent jealousy/disdain for educated people with higher wages
Thats interesting, because i (grown up in Austria) always just viewed Slovenia as the  ex eastern-bloc/yugoslav country with the highest wages Think it was the first fact i knew about it
Used to just think of Slovenia as rich Slovakia (until i learned more about the countries, forgive my ignorance :P )
I pay 16€ for 25GB with 15GB of those usable in EU and Switzerland
It is a youth plan though, I think the standard price would be 25€.
I'm glad I live this side of the border when it comes to phone plans
Gonna add onto that one french guy below me: 48 countries with different histories, technological standards along with academical standards are never the same
its the same in austria, i can basically forget going to university if my parents werent ready to support me which they thankfully are
What do you mean by that
Didn't quite get what you meant, but I don't think Austria gets more international media attention than Denmark, I think they're pretty similar in impact
Oh ok
Daarvan merk ik niet veel
Ben meestal op het bootje boven in Friesland
Misschien geeft het ook verschillen tussen de provincies
The mediterrenean is always bluer on the other side
No I can't think of anything too similar to your story
The only time I remember a death being announced during a TV show was that of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination
It happened at night though (like 10
30 pm) so Golden Girls was on (not a kids show)
It was just an insert and it said more details would be given in a special news broadcast after the current show
Seeing as I still remember it I guess it made an impact on me as a kid but it's not a widespread experience that anybody talks about anymore
The death if the public figure itself wasn't unique to my country, nor was the program that was interrupted for it
But still, the event was special enough for little me to remember it even almost two decades later
On Saturday, April 2nd 2005, the Austrian TV station ORF1 showed Dreamwork's Shrek in their 20:15 timeslot
Roughly an hour later, just when the montage with the song Hallelujah playing in the background was playing, the film was interrupted indefinitely because of an important message: Pope John Paul II had died
Two days later, we'd talk about it in class
All my 9 year old class mates and I *really* cared about however, was that the movie had been interrupted
The event for some reason popped into my head a few weeks ago, and I mentioned it to my friends
Surprisingly, they also remembered that Shrek being interrupted because the Pope died
That time when the Ibiza scandal was made public though :D
I think it is fortunate that we are able to live in such a time
I still think it is exceptional that one of the most important european friendship is between France and Germany nowadays
After having such a long and fierce history of wars with each other, this for me is one of the most beautiful political advancements of the past 70 years
Seeing Mitterand and Kohl holding hands at Verdun still gives me goosebumps
I always get reminded of that fact when I visit Prague
I live in Vienna and what you often find here in the inner districts, seemingly completely random between the beautiful old buildings, are ugly newer ones
These are the places were misguided bombs hit
These holes had to be filled quickly with cheaply built houses after the war
I actually don't see such obvious "Bombenlöcher" that often in Prague, which otherwise feels very similar to Vienna
I actually live in one of those buildings, which I often curse when I try to drill holes in the wall to mount stuff
They are made of debris from the ruins (cheap material found on the streets back then) and would sometimes have huge junks falling out
Anyway, it reminds me that Vienna was bombed more than other cities and I sometimes try to connect this thought with the stories my grandparents tell about that time
Kind of
I can‘t imagine not traveling anywhere and maybe hearing war planes fly over your house/country and being scared that they might come for you this time
But I can imagine my country being ruled by the Habsburg monarchy easily for whatever reason, and war is a given for me during that time
Seeing their weapons, their methods on how they attacked others/protected themself really did give me an insight on how war might‘ve been, and it doesn‘t feel all that strange (I still would never wish it upon anybody)
Memories of Barney or memories war, both sounds terrible in its own way
Imagine how terrible it must be for those Iraqis who were tortured by the US army with the Barney intro song on full volume for hours
For them the memories of Barney and war will be forever intertwined
We have siren tests every Saturday at noon
However they are often used for the voluntary firebrigade and have 2 other uses
Basically just go inside and watch the public television service, radio or nowadays the Internet
Pretty sure it is not effective against air strikes, as of now
Yeah, in Austria it's every Saturday at noon
It's quite short, really just checking if the thing's working
I was quite surprised to learn that not every country does it
For beer we use the Seidl and Krügerl
Nowadays they're defined as 0,3l and 0,5l but they're derived from pre-metric measurements
For firewood some regions still use the Klafter, derived from the arm length
We have the Decker which is 10 grams
It's still fairly commonly used
"Deka"(short) or "Dekagramm" (englisch decagram) for 10 g. Technically it is SI conform (and can even be abbreviated as "dag") but you won't usually see it
Mainly used for shopping, e.g. meat
We sometimes use some weird metric based units like dekagramm (or just deka)
For a long time (farm)land was measured in "morgen" (translated literally "morning") which meant the amount  of land a single farmer could use on a single day
But what kind of stone
Cubic decimeter of granite or something
Because just stone is inprecise
Also Pfiff for 0,2l (or half a Seidl, varies regionally)
Ster for a m³ of stacked wood
Klafter for 3 m³ of stacked wood
We also have dekagramm (dag) , which is 10g.
It's Deka and is short for Dekagramm (10 grams) which is just like saying Kilo for Kilogramm (1000 grams)
A Festmeter isn't stacked
A Festmeter is a m³ of solid wood
Stacked wood is Schichtmeter or Ster
A Klafter is 3 Ster
Then there is also Schüttmeter for a m³ in a pile
Akropolis in Athens, Kathedral in Cologne, Tower Bridge in London, Collosseum in Rome, Red Square in Moscow, Notre Dame in Paris and Castle Hohensalzburg in Salzburg

Seven wonders was the question
Don’t see where Auschwitz is a wonder
And by the way you completely vitiated your own point
You said „cultural heritage“ and Auschwitz is not a cultural heritage of Europe because our culture doesn’t include gassing people to their fucking death
If Auschwitz is what you think of when you hear culture, you should visit more real cultural heritage sites to remind yourself what our culture really is about
We don’t tear the place down, that’s what we do to remind people of the atrocities that happened there
Why else would we let it be there
The thought is that people go there and think of all the terrible things humans did to other humans there, and not people go there to say: Oh wow what a great place it’s truly one of the 7 wonders of Europe
Of course people need to hear about it
But it’s not a cultural wonder
What has a concentration camp to do with European culture
Is it our culture to gas people to death
You have to understand the difference between culture and history
It’s a historical monument, no question about that
But it’s not a cultural heritage
This is really not how culture works but fine, you do you
Living in a catholic country
It's good to have more holidays than the neighboring countries like Germany ;)
Suddenly I'm super happy about our Nordsee stores
Matjesbaguette is great
Am I allowed to mentioned stores that are not originally European
Because then I'd like to have a Chipotle here, so we get at least *some* Mexican food
Be the change you wish to see:
> Leberkas-Pepi from Austria
There's not even enough Leberkas Pepi *within* Austria
I just love it
They used to have a store in London, but I think it didn't go that well
But I could imagine it would go really well in Czechia or Slovakia
They could test the waters in Prague or maybe even Budweis (not too far from the home base in Linz), and then expand to Brno
I have to have a Mohnflesserl with Käseleberkäse every couple of weeks
It's a must
> Also in Vienna in particular its one of the cheapest ways to eat out while still getting a taste of the hearty Austrian cuisine
Käsekrainer is another great option
Even at the most upscale places it's usually under €4-5
Linz isn't that far away from Czechia, so it should be fairly easy to get it to Czechia
No, because nobody says "email". Everyone just says "mail". So you'd replace a shorter word with a longer one, which does not make sense
Also at least here there is tons of other email providers, so it's not like gmail would have a that dominant position
Nope
At work it's still like 100% MS Outlook
And in the private sector gmail and hotmail are like 45:45 in my area
With the remaining 10% being a few local distributors
So the overall market share isn't really that high
And I never heard somebody say "gmail me this". That would be weird
Not a thing in Austrian German
Probably because saying "dschie-mehl" is more awkward to fit into a normal German sentence than the standard "ii-mehl". Most people just shorten it to mail ("mehl") anyway, which can be turned into a verb as well ("mail mir etwas", mail me something)
That would sound wrong with "gmail" though
Also from a usage standpoint: While many people do have Gmail accounts, especially in their private life, still you'd be excluding everyone who uses a different provider (gmx, yahoo, work email address, ...)
So, in short: the original word "e-mail" is already short and has been shortened further to "mail", so there's no reason to make it longer again while also excluding people, and use gmail instead
>Also at least here there is tons of other email providers
A ton
What did I miss
There's the occasional tech illiterate hotmail or gmx user who didn't migrate over yet (read: my mom), but gmail has a clear market lead
Where I live everybody says email and not mail
And also GMX is still quite popular in Austria and Germany
Using other providers than gmail has nothing to do with being tech illiterate, and of course all company email has custom domains on top
What
I get about 150 mails a day, and 90% of them are sent over business servers with the company's domain name as adress
Lots of people use their internet providers mail, especially if they stick with the same company they started with (or it's original name) - tons of @ chello for example
any work email address using your company's domain name, for example
apart from that it's mostly gmail and gmx, hotmail, yahoo though, I'll concede that
You forget all the branded business mail adresses running via Outlook
hello gugu
Not anymore
All new addresses are gmail and have been since 2012 when google gained the rights
People with googlemail do have the option to switch to a gmail ending and I think most do or did, but sometimes I still see the rare googlemail address
oh yeah ... I still got GMX ... and one of their joke domain addresses as well :D
I've still got a GMX account from back when I was a kid
It has just my name so it's not like it's inappropriate to use, but what annoys me very much is the GMX Newsletter you get every couple of weeks and that they build in ads that look like like new mails in your inbox
Honestly, if it weren't for the couple of friends and acquaintances who occasionally send mails to that address I would've gotten rid of it already
yeah, of course, but those are two vastly different cases
If your business uses a gmail adress, that doesn't sound too good, man
haha
I thought this goes without saying, but I was talking about private users
works same for many other things, mostly in the technical sector that is full of loan words
we can call a hard disk just "disk", because we have our own word if we just mean the shape
etc
etc
Just have whatever other email provider you use pull the mails from gmx via POP3
Easy as that
You can unsubscribe the newsletter
For the people I know: because they got these addresses since a _long_ time and there is no nice available name on gmail any more
And before I'd have [some-stupid-username]@gmail
com I'd rather stick with a nice [firstname
lastname]@gmx
at or something, even if it goes to some gmail account in the brackground
How is that obvious
Also ich kenn keine größere Firma die ihre Mails über Gmail o.ä. verschickt
Die betreiben alle ihre eigenen Server (bzw
zahlen wen dafür)
That's what I'm doing currently, but I still haven't figured out how to not receive the spam newsletter
POP
Whst century are you living in
I've tried
I cannot
Viele der grossen US UNis verwenden gmail
Von aussen merkst davon natuerlich nichts weils alls @uni
edu adressen sind aber unter der Haube rennt Gmail
Yeah, that one is a little annoying, but it directly gets filtered into the spam folder for me, so it's only a minor nuisance \^\^
good enough if you just need emails fetched from somewhere
Weird, I've a gmx account, too, and don't get the newsletter ... can you tag it as spam or something
I use a gmx
at account and in my account settings it says (in German) that [I cannot unsubscribe because it's part of being a free user
Is yours gmx
net or gmx
Edit: words
Ahhh that explains it, totally forgot about that possibility
I've got a paid account
Lol, well that explains that
I was already getting really worked up because I thougt some accounts get the newsletter and others don't.
Germany, Czechia, Turkey/Ottomans, Hungary and France probably
As for Austria:
* Germany (duh)
* Hungary probably a whole bunch
* Italy maybe bc of WW1 and WW2
* Russia maybe too bc those guys really
wanted to have our country badly after WW2
* Lastly I‘d say either a lil bit of Serbia or a lil bit of Entente overall (if that counts) bc they equally divided Austria into 4 parts from 1945-1955
Edit: Ok
I forgot that Austria-Hungary also had Czechia (and that Prague was the capital of Austria-Hungary for some time before Vienna) and many parts of Poland as property, so maybe just cross out the last one and insert Czechoslowakia or smth
Germany (are really close to it, nearly ended up as a part of it)
France (culture, whole history of Europe, important aristocratic ties)
Italy (commerce, culture)
Hungary (organizationally the most important part of the empire except Austria)
Czechia (culturally also a very close part of the empire)
As always with questions that deal with both history and nations, this is kinda hard when you want to include some areas that aren't even "countries" right now but used to be back then (Bavaria, Salzburg, etc), as well as all ex crown dependencies
You totally forgot about Italy
But as a matter of fact, I would say that since we used to rule that much of Europe, the whole continent is somehow important historically (not only the regions we used to rule, but also those who were our rivals and enemies during these times)
I'd say Germany, Italy, Hungary, Russia, Turkey
Depends on how we count the former parts of the Austrian empire though
In my eyes this is online gambling
It should be treated as such (which basically means it is exempt from the shared market and requires a dedicated license in each country)
yes
it's nothing more than a way to get ppl to pay more for the mostly full price game
Its a form of gambling in my mind and should therefore fall under those laws
That would *maybe* be true if the games weren't built to make you want those extras
Its subtle but extremely effective manipulation
Heck, I work in a gambling company and its a fucking huuuge pain in the ass for us already (and in a bunch of countries you don't even get licenses because they got a state monopoly - like in Germany or Austria)
And we got nothing better to do with our time, while game dev studios (I hope) actually spend their time developing games
Yeah nobody likes fungus
It's coarse and it's rough and it gets everywhere
Sure, it's from Star Trek
>A good example would be German
Your point is moot, as German dialects are already dying out
Please stop pretending being pro-EU and being pro-EU-federalization are the same thing lmao
pro Europe doesn't mean pro EU federation
South of what

Ever been to Munich in the last decades lol
When you look at r/okoidawappler and r/aeiou you'll find the expected memes about Austrian politicians and celebrities (like [this one] which is a play on our presidents name Van der Bellen and a soft drink called Fanta) but also memes about fictional characters from different TV shows, books or ads, like Tom Turbo, Kasperl and Baumaxerl
But I can't really think of a specific meme template that stuck around for longer and only in Austrian subreddits
i liked the "cow of the river" memes, but they are just a austrian verion of panzer of the lake
probably every single scene from the very good documentary series "Der Pennymarkt auf der Reeperbahn"?
„Nehmen Sie das sofort herunter
Was soll das
“ / english:
„Take that down immediately, what are you doing
There was a leak in a database and a guy on twitter posted the private adress of an austrian politician, then she twittered the above sentence
It quickly became a meme, the above one is funny because you are not supposed to put gravy on your schnitzel
The only memes I can think of are either german or not really memes
Maybe calling [Sebastian Kurz ] (a politician) [Dumbo]
Austria:
The "Baumaxerl" is just the icon of a wood/constructionshop and he essentially commits horrendous warcrimes
I hope "Nehmen Sie das sofort herunter
Was soll das
" will live on
>But I can't really think of a specific meme template that stuck around for longer and only in Austrian subreddits
Genau das Gegenteil ist der Fall ;)
Mit freundlichen Grüßen
it’s mostly phrases like "Jetzt erst recht" or "THC Strache" that are used ironically they ain’t real templates tho
I've seen Swedish versions, det er fredag mina bekanter
Well theoretically we Austrians could
But we have our own way of saying that
Red deitsch du wappla
Yeah that would be one of the variants
Haha
I would say Switzerland
It's like a rivalry on the same level
Even though the Swiss german is quite hard to understand we can it if we really try
Besides we have also the Alps in common and the love for wintersport
For me Germany feels like the  older brother, we look up to them and know everything about them but in the other way around the just think It the small brother they are just cute with their dialects and nice with the landscape but otherwise the don't know to much
Many would say Germany, but a 100% no
Switzerland seems right although many Swiss people would probably say Germany or France
Not a country but i would say for Austria it's Bravia
We have a lot in common like dialect, culture, landscape and we both hate the rest of germany
I'd say Hungary, but as anyhwere, it really depends on the region
Germany feels really distant to me
Definitely France, because we don't talk to the Swiss and the Germans are our puppet state (just kidding)
No srsly this answer is rather complex for Austria
So I will try:
Language wise: Germany and Switzerland
Culturally: Czechia, Slovenia and Bavaria
Mentality: Czechia, Slovenia, Hungary and Italy
To cite wikipedia on the Austria-Czech relation:
> In 2008, [Karl Schwarzenberg] (Czech minister of foreign affairs) and [Jiri Grusa] who has acted as Czech ambassador and as director of the [Diplomatic Academy in Vienna] shared the opinion that Austrians and Czechs are of different language, but of "the same nation", the same character
[\[2\]] .
Germany
We have a very intimate love-hate relationship
-Austria
>Even though the Swiss german is quite hard to understand we can it if we really try
Except you are from Vorarlberg than it's easy
well you don't even border us so that makes sense
That’s not really true though
Vorarlberg mostly speak Alemannic and they are culturally pretty similar to BW
Vorarlberg is language wise actually closer to BaWü than Bavaria and have a direct connection over the Bodensee
The rest is Bavaria of course
You still have many places in Baden-Württemberg with the Austrian flag in their coat of arms from the good ol' Outer Austria days
That's gotta count for something
I just wanted to say "How does your military help Lichtenstein during an invasion if Lichtenstein is actually invaded BY your military" :D
Well I guess only Südtirol yes, whole Italy definitely not
We regard the Swiss closer to you guys than to us, because there isn't much of a relationship between Austria and Switzerland funnily enough
I think Switzerland is like the guy in the village which is related to everybody but prefers to be alone
Huh
You're either oversensitive or my wording might have been bad, but I didn't want to imply anything like that
I just wanted to say that from my perspective Germany's and Switzerland's relationship seems much closer than the Austrian-Swiss one
Germany is obviously the country closest to "being a brother" to us
A minor correction here: We mostly distance us from the northern part which stems back to the historic rivalry between Prussia and Austria
The word "Piefke" actually refers to the Prussians not Germans in general
Most Austrians love Southern Germans and see them one one footing especially Bavaria
But even with the northern part it's more like a "frienemy" relationship today than actual hate
We Austrians don't take most things that seriously and it's more jokingly

Austria and Germany shares a lot of old wedding traditions, but I want to explain a decent, unusual one
It's called "Brautstehlen"  or "Steal the bride".
Normally it is done on the countryside and right before the wedding
Some guests/good friends attempt to kidnap the bride with the groom not noticing, taking her to one bar/place to drink, dance and sing
The groom has to find her, usually until then everyone drank a lot already and the soon-to-be husband has to pay for the drinks to get her back
It's a bit annoying because you have to get ready for the wedding afterwards, but at least everyone is in a relaxed mood and doesn't take everything seriously
Stealing the bride
At some point of the evening somebody "kidnaps" your newly wed wife and you have to do a scavenger hunt through the are that normaly ends in paying a large bar tab somewhere for half the invited people at some local bar
I think „Braut stehlen“ (Bride stealing) is exclusive to my country (?)
I haven’t married nor have I ever been to a wedding, but I think I know the concept of bride stealing - if somebody knows better feel free to correct me
So the couple marries and after the ceremony all the guests go together to a restaurant
However, during the drive there, it may be that the car where the bride is in drives to a different restaurant or bars to basically get drunk
The groom and his car have to drive after them and find them, if they’re unlucky they also have to pay for everything the bride and her friends drunk
The bride and her friends drive to as many different restaurants/bars as they can before getting caught by the groom and his friends
It even occurred once (my parents have a restaurant and the wedding meal took place in that restaurant) that the groom doesn‘t find the bride nor her friends at all and has to search for her the whole evening
:‘D It‘s a quite funny/weird thing and if you own a restaurant you get a lot of money out of it lol
Edit: Sometimes it‘s also done before the wedding
I saw your post after I finished typing mine
In Austrian we do the same, except you always go out drinking with the bride and get the groom to pay for everything to get her back
We have that in Austria too, but it happens during the wedding festivities, so at some point in the night
After the ceremony the wedding party usually moves to a tavern/inn/hostelry (I don't think there's a proper translation for Wirtshaus) and the main event takes place in the "ballroom", the biggest room
The bride is kidnapped by family members to another room in the tavern and to get to her the groom has to fulfill multiple tasks, like walking over the long table and giving a kiss to every woman and having a drink with every man sitting at it until he can reach his bride at the end of it
Like the copperto in Italy
In German, Kuvert means envelope too
You are spot on with the etymology btw
Add a simplified/modernized version of our emblem eagle
Austro-Hungarian flag is pretty nice I think, tho without Hungary it would be very pointless
I wouldn‘t change it much, just make the eagle mandatory
It bothers me that the eagle is only on the flags of the Hofburg and polictians, but barely anywhere else
(Or maybe just throw the eagle out as a whole)
I don't think I would change anything
The red-white- red combo is very very old, dating back to the 12th
century bc
It has since then always been a part of Austria in some kind, be it as official flag or as part of the Habsburg coat of arms
So, no change needed imo
i think that emblem is a little bit too complex to be on a flag
i would remove the one from slovak flag too
but then it's Russia :P slovak flag needs a redesign
Also pretty sure your southern states would not really appreciate that, because they got fuck-all to do with the nordic countries
And even for northern Germany it's a stretch
I like the latvian flag, maybe a little brighter red and a thicker white stripe and it’s perfect
One of the old (K.u.K) double eagles would also be cool ... But not really fitting since we aren't a monarchy :/
Clean it all up with a Union
No, generally kids don't pay rent as a point of principle, especially if the parents own the property
It depends on the economic situation of the parents too of course, but charging the kids rent if you're wealthy as it is and the rent barely registers on the bank account anyway just seems cruel tbh
For poor folks this doesn't apply of course, if the parents really need the money for something that isn't luxury, it's fair enough to charge rent
Don't think that's common
Maybe if you got a job and they want to kick you out but otherwise
I moved in and out of the country quite a lot, every time I move back I stay at my parents place until I find my own place and they never charged any rent
I had to google this because I had no clue and didn‘t find anything related to it so I think, sadly, no, we do not have a national pet
We do have a national animal tho
It‘s the black eagle
Found on our [flag] too
Isn't it rather that there's a Prime Minister at Downing Street in London where the cat lives
Funny, this post is about pets, and then I see pictures of polar bears and octopuses
yes, I learned swedish after learning norwegian, and it was the most surprising thing to hear swedes say that norwegian goes so much up and down with the melody
I think swedish does that even more
though it depends on the norwegian dialect
Well most people hear German in context of military in war movies, plus standard German sounds very different to most of the dialects
case in point, even hitler [sounded nice when he was not screaming]
Well there may be some truth to that: [
Edit: [
Star Wars Episode 2 and it's said by Anakin Skywalker
It's a [masterpiece]
I know, but my sister in law and some colleages, which are turks, also told me that they can easily understand some parts of Japanese, and although I know that the theory is controversal, I hear this again and again
Oh damn it, didn't see that
Thank you Turkey for introducing coffee to Vienna, even if that wasn't the plan
The Soviet Union and Stalin for instigating the talks and using his political capital so that we were able to become a neutral republic and not occupied or split like Germany
Thank you France for Robert Schumann
Is there something I can read up on this ? Because I'm really interested in learning more about this
If I may ask, social role in what sense
Stalin actually tried to do the same thing with Germany
But the Americans wanted to win the cold war, so they were against it
> Soviet leader Joseph Stalin put forth a proposal for a reunification and neutralization (in the sense of being neutral) of Germany, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for "the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly" and free activity of democratic parties and organizations

When i lived in a house with my parents the doors would be locked only during night
I moved to an apartment, and no one ever locked doors except for when nobody was home
Usually not
The door doesn't open from the outside without a key anyway
Growing up, we'd lock the front door at night and when going out, and it would not lock automatically, so you could just walk in
That's common in the countryside
Living in a city flat, the door locks automatically, I only lock it with my keys when going out
My partner's parents in the UK do not have a self-locking door and always lock the door manually AND REMOVE the keys and take them into the next room
I hate it
The number of times I have tried to pop outside real quick only to realise that I have no idea where the keys are and that I would have no way of getting out if there was a fire is scary
On the countryside in Austria this is different
There are almost no self locking doors here
I know everyone has one in the city
We had the same
My parents didn't lock their cars until the cars got the remotes and became self locking
The garage didn't even have a door
Tiny village in Northern Germany
Don’t your doors lock automatically when you close them
I thought that was standard here
On the countryside it's not like that
At least in Austria
If you don't manually lock it with a key, self-locking doors are incredibly easy to get into
Yeah, it is
But you get used to always having your key with you
I once locked myself out of my apartment and had to climb in through the balcony
Luckily the balcony door was open
>If you forget your keys inside you're fucked
If you don't manually lock it, it's not really locked
You can get inside with a credit card or a similar tool
>There are almost no self locking doors here
They are getting more and more common
I don't see any new homes without self locking doors
And people also upgrade their old doors to self locking
I had both
Honestly  i hate the self-locking ones
Opening the lock in case i forget my keys inside is probably roughly as expensive as anything someone would actually steal from my apartment, and roughly 200 times more likely
>The door needs keys to open from the inside
Yes
A properly locked door will always need a key to open it
Regardless of inside or outside
Yes, when locked by key it needs a key to unlock it
Who would
Do people really drop by without calling first
>Wait, you can open your main door from outside without a key
Have you ever seen a door handle
They do exactly that
*Almost* noone has a self locking door
I know the doors of all my ~15 neighbor houses and only one of them has a self locking door
Aber ich kann auch nur das beurteilen, das ich kenne
Also was weiß ich
Das von dem Haus in dem ich wohne ist auch nicht selbstschließend
>So if you walk out of the house without your key, you’re automatically locked out
The door won't open without a key, but its not really locked
You can open it in a few seconds with a credit card or something similar
Even the ultra expensive "secured against credit cards" locks are really easy to open with a credit card
New homes
I have not seen a house built in the last 15 years that doesn't have an automatically locking door
Maybe if the owners really cheap out on the door
Ah ok
Honestly, i dont think that ever happens
Obviously, break ins do happen here, but they almost always target family-homes in villages, when the occupants arent there
They are easier targets, theres more to gain, and its easy to check if the occupants are there
Or sometimes they clear basements and the like
Maybe an apartment if its really obvious that nobody is home
I think the probability of someone just walking into my apartment is about zero
What burglar would be insane enough to just randomly walk into apartments
I understand the feeling though - i always lock at night, not even because i think anything could happen, just because it feels nice
> but I'm not aware of handles installed outside a front door
They were by far the most common option here until quite recently
And they still are in many parts of the world
You had automatically locking doors in the 1950s? On single family homes
Meine Nachbarn haben alle ziemlich neue Häuser ~13 Jahre
Nur einer mit automatisch sperrender Tür dabei
Bin auch in der Baubranche hab jetzt aber nie bewusst auf Türen geachtet
> For most front doors I have seen this wouldn't work
It does
You have to bend the card around one or two corners
Its easier than you think
Even works on really expensive "credit card proof" locks
If you don‘t manually lock the door, it isn‘t really locked
Interessant
Ich sehe fast nur automatisch sperrende Türen bei Neubauten
Nicht selbstsperrende Türen bekommt man eigentlich kaum mehr
Wenn man in die Kataloge schaut sind beinahe alle Türen selbstsperrend
Just as an aside, Austrian English speaker tend to pronounce the initial voiced th (as in "the") as d rather than s. So it would be:
*Dschohn mäid his wäi tu ä täwan zru de dark forest, onli tu feind aut dät hie vorgott* ^(I like how you changed the f to a v, so it resembles "vergessen" more closely) *de manni*
Having ð is like cheating
Well I laughed out loud in the middle of a cafe because of the fanny
I hate you
And thanks for the laugh
> not a translation
I personally would also write "fru" instead of "zru", but that probably depends on if you're used to a more British or American pronounciation
Austrian German speakers tend to replace it with "d" rather than "s"
Yeah true
I'd say that my English speaking skills are pretty good, but the *thr(V)* constellation still is hard for me

The EU should stick together and start to actively boycot any country that stands against France in this matter

Unfortunately this is never going to happen, because the EU will never stand together in such a matter
No actions but some words of shock and then going back to normal

It´s good for France and Macron to stand their ground

Snow if there is a bunch of it at once and it is cold enough for it to stay, its fine
But what I truely hate is snow-melting-snow-melting if it is too warm during the day and you end up with snowslush and salt-dirt mixture every other day
I'd even prefer -20 to that
It´s not even only Turkey, I think Qatar, Jordan and other countries also removed french products from their supermarkets
As I said, if the EU had actual balls (which we know they don´t have), they would stop exporting goods to these countries as a whole
Wanna see these Qataris squrim when they don´t get their Mercedes, BMW and other luxury cars or even replacement parts
I wonder how the people react now after the pope told to not discriminate the homosexuals

In Austria, i‘d say they are all pretty equal
But we have a rather small but special one for technical fields for mountain industries „Montan University“ in Leoben
Which is pretty neat
The TU (Technical University) is one of the most prestigious ones here
It is considered to be rather old-fashioned and difficult, but if you graduate you definitely achieved something in life
Law as well
STEM is mostly done at universities too
Slovenia is nice, but it's so similar to Austria in many aspects that it's kinda underwhelming as a destination
Well if I had to pick one I'd say latvia, but it's more me not knowing much about the country and it's history than the country itself being uninteresting, i feel like it's just overshadowed in a way by it's two baltic neighbours as well
Many people seem to love Ireland but it's one of the most uninteresting countries in Europe for me and I don't really consider visiting it
Please don't take offense to this, but if I had to choose probably Slovenia
But I think that's only because we have a lot of big and famous neighbouring countries, so it doesn't get that much limelight
ah don't sell yourself short, you have great places to go skiing
I think there's some beautiful and super well preserved Byzantine Churches in N. Macedonia

Hell are we happy we are boring in this age around
Still there are a few things from not so boring times that one could find interesting
I find England to be very dull to visit, but I think that is because I have been many times and there is little new for me to see
British history however I find fascinating
It's history is so distant to the super entwined history of the continent it often seems like a different world entirely
Gor example, the invasions of the British Isles seem much more invasive as, being an island, it has very clearly defined borders
It's a strange little microcosm, with similar historical events as the European continent condensed on to an island smaller than Germany
To be fair, Vienna is probably the most interesting vacation spot in the country
Sure, there's Tyrol and Carinthia with their alps (and probably some others too but I am from that region) and other cities, but let's be real, Vienna takes the win
It's just that there are tons of countries I'm much more interested in
Nope, there are so many countries I'd rather go to

> Habsburg Empire
Potato potato
In Austrian German you can replace "bitte" with "schnell" pretty often without sounding rude
At least when talking to family&friends
"Kannst mir schnell das Salz geben"
"Kannst mir bitte das Salz geben"
The Ibiza scandal shows that we're trying really hard, but we're just too stupid
&nbsp;
Sarcasm aside: corruption actually runs deep in Austria's political and public veins, but not the kind of in-your-face corruption you might think of, but a way more subtle kind, the kind where legal grey areas get exploited by those in power
Austria is also somewhat inert to change, so introducing stricter laws against it takes a lot of time
Almost like the people who profit from these loopholes don't want to give that up
The situation is a bit more complex and way deeper than I can possibly describe in a short comment and I'm sure it is "jammern auf hohem Niveau" in comparison to what other countries do, but by no means is Austria perfect and pure
We are only Corrupt in Ibiza
It depends wholly on the government
We've gone from right-wing coke-snorting, money bag hauling puppets of Russia to a temporary technocracy, to an entirely new government
We'll see what the new guys give us
Spoilers: The major party licks the big capitalist's boots and is potentially stuffed to all hell
The only useful constant throughout the past couple of years is our president, Van Der Bellen
This man has kept a cool mind and much needed composure while all this was going on
Have a look at the [Corruption Perceptions Index]
This is no way of talking about your democratically elected president and philanthrope Vladimir Putin
Same here
We call it "Freunderlwirtschaft" ("friends economy")
In many parts of bureaucracy you are getting things done much quicker if you have friends; or get public fundings or public contracts because you have friends
And since I am so grateful that my friend helped me, I will of course help him whenever I can
That's basically the mentality that a lot of people still have
Some of our most famous criminal cases involve deviations of that - for example, a guy lobbied inside a ministry for a bidder that wanted to buy public flats
Somehow* he got information on how high the bid of the competitor was, therefore his bidder could out-bid them and pay the lobbyist a lot of money
)* lobbyist was friends with multiple politicians
Prosecution says that the lobbyist then split the money that he got from the bidding company with said politicians; but there is no hard evidence
Yeah it is not the pay to that clerk to get a permit or to that one to process your paperwork in time corruption
But the finance minister invests his mother in law's money to (with some rich friends) buy that bank from a federal state to sell it to that german bank a day later kind of corruption
Or friends of that minister calling each other to understand what work it was that they got money from a company that bought a couple of thousand apartments from the state after increasing their offer to be less than 1% above the previously best offer
Edit: let me add as a disclaimer: i am not saying anything here is illegal, that would be for the courts to decide
>we're trying really hard, but we're just too stupid
This resonates with me
Why have I never heard that before
Best description of Austrian politics in general imho
Freunderlwirtschaft
And at the same time, if you want to do it honestly, you will drown and not be able to keep up
And since none of that is illegal there is no incentive to change
I don't think that was ever the case
For a long time however, you got a public-owned flat much faster if you were a SPÖ member
its more that people in city are more likely to vote for SPÖ so they invest more into cheap Gemeindebauten and thereby make people in cities more likely to vote SPÖ.
It's definitely a "disappointed, but not surprised" situation for me
Except for their core voters, who will vote for them regardless, they took an image hit
But people should have gone to jail, anti-corruption should have been made agenda #1, etc
You really got a taste of Karma

Serenade No
10 KV 361 by W.A. Mozart is one of them but I would answer with Mozart pieces in general
Here in Austria of course we also have pop music and good music from the 20th century (search for Austropop if you’re interested)
But for me nothing comes close in beauty and genius to Mozart
[Moneyboy - Dreh den Swag auf]
I'm from austria
Choose your favorite composer because there are to many beautiful pieces
Rondo alla turka (Turkish March, Türkischer Marsch) from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
> For my personally it would be Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata
Technically he composed that in Slovakia though
So you could say it "came out of" Slovakia
Amazing piece
I too love it
SILENCE GERMAN, don’t touch our precious Mozart
Mozart is from austria
Ma vlast by Smetana
I really like it
If you like Tallis and Vaughan Williams you have to love Vaughan Williams ' *Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis* It's a masterclass in orchestration and stunningly beautiful
Id say they arent really comparable, they are just way too different
Sorry but that's for a rather niche group
I really don't like that kind of Deutschrap but if you like it I won't judge you
Exactly
Most of them are really catchy tunes
Moneyboy is the new Mozart
Wenn du nach diesem Prinzip antwortest, dann wären auch alle heutigen Österreicher Deutsche, weil man sich vor 100 Jahren noch als solche gesehen hatte
Mozart wirkte aber die Mehrheit seines Lebens am österreichischen-kaiserlichen Hofe und in Salzburg, weshalb er nach heutiger Situation, aufgrund der neuen österreichischen Identität, ein Österreicher ist
Mozart was born in the Independent Bishopric of Salzburg
Seiler und Speer oida
He was, along with Mozart, but they don‘t seem to care
The Reichskreise were created by Maximilian of Austria for administrative reasons during the Reichsregiment and not at all a homogeneous territory
That‘s like saying the EU is a nation
1945
The last time you could consider (besides the Anschluss of course) Austria a German nation was in the German Confederation which disbanded with the Declaration of the German Empire
Furthermore, this confederation was already pretty loose
Are you sure you‘re not talking about the Anschluss right now that happened int 1938 that made Austria be german in the first place
Because in 1945 the Austria we know today, the second republic of Austria, came to life
Austria didn‘t just not exist until 1945 and just magically appeared from the remains of WW2
According to documents Ostarrichi was first mentioned int 996
What a stupid argument and comparison to Hitler
In case you forgot, the German people wanted Hitler as their Führer and he was the Führer of nazi GERMANY when he committed atrocities
How is Austria in any way responsible for it, when the Germans made him big
He was only born in Austria
He served under the German imperial army in WW1 while at the same time giving up his Austrian passport
Hitler is entirely Germany‘s fault
I don‘t want to start a fight, but I‘m surprised you say that, considering you‘re German
So Hitler really was German, thank you for confirming that
Now that I know that, Pfiat di
Toll, das ist genau was ich gesagt habe
Er ist in Österreich geboren, aber beging seine Verbrechen gegen die Menschheit als deutscher Staatsbürger
Inwiefern man das auf Österreich schieben kann, würde ich gerne erfahren
Neither was he in Germany
So what is he then
A Salzburgian
And what is Salzburg part of today
Austria
Therefore he is by modern borders an Austrian
Ok as long as it‘s your opinion I will let you be, because it‘s your opinion
(I very much disagree with it, but I don‘t like arguing with people so let‘s just leave it at that
Have a wonderful day/evening/night
Every German even today considers Austrians as Germans very often, when we in fact have a full on different culture, slightly different language and everything
Also this conversation was 2 days ago, I don‘t want to start this conversation about wether Austrians are German or not while many Germans call Mozart German while Hitler was 100% Austrian all over again
All I can say is that if you are in Austria and say any Austrian ist German you can be happy if you get out of here alive
Have a nice day and goodbye
Vienna pupil here
I don't know how I can describe it
The public transport and the infrastructure in Vienna is perfect
Also I think the city is very beautiful and has certain aspects not every big city has, for example the "old Danube" which is like an oasis in the middle of the city
I can't think of living anywhere else
Too nice here, couldn’t really imagine living anywhere else
It’s cool to have everything I need in reach as well as spots to go to if I need to relax
I also have some friends living close to me, who I can meet
The one thing most noticeable about living in a big city is probably the contact with different opinions, cultures and a lot of different people in general, which is something I really like
I actually see no downsides to living here and don’t understand the people who prefer living on the countryside for reasons other than medical ones (too much stress or noise in the city, maybe bad air quality or smth like that)
On the air quality note, my city actually has quite decent air quality for a city with a population >1m. That is thanks to a wind constantly blowing from the west to the east
Sometimes, however, that wind stops and that’s when it gets real bad
A few months ago there was no wind for days and I was close to needing a breathing mask because holy shit
Vienna expat/student here
The city is beautiful, full of history and amazing for the services it offers
Everything you need for the daily life is in walking or cycling distance, every area is packed with parks, I can walk at night through literally every corner of the city without a problem and the public transit is without exageration the best in the world
Even the motor traffic is a breeze compared to many other, even smaller places I know (although the Viennese would beg to differ)
All this while being decently affordable
Nevertheless, originally moving in here from Timișoara, Romania’s third biggest city, Vienna gives me more of an oversized village vibe rather than a big city one
It is awfully quiet at almost any time, the nightlife closes early and is mostly a let-down, and getting in in any social circle almost always requires some kind of pedigree from you
In my experience, locals while not being mean per se, are disproportionately proud and aren’t by anything in the world interested in intercultural communication, so you’d mostly end up hanging out with other foreigners who usually feel the same
E v e r y  shop is closed on Saturdays afternoon and all of Sundays and even the larger supermarkets have a reduced sortiment than what I’m used to in eastern european countries
It’s not rarely that I find myself travelling through all the city to find a trivial product I’m looking for
In all these regards, my hometown feels way more of a metropolis than Vienna at its almost 2 million inhabitants; and don’t even get me started on Bucharest
Vienna is certainly an amazing city
I just don’t vibe with it enough, so I’m gonna move somewhere else in the future
Also from Vienna
Nice inner city, but due to Corona I only go there to donate blood
Username checks out
There also negative sides
Its very hard to find a good place to live because the prices are ridicolous
The city administration also ignores major problems like over Immigration in certain areas or traffic noise
Vienna isnt a chill and romantic city anymore
Rent and public transport prices are wild in Germany
In Vienna, the year long public transport ticket costs 365€ a year
How do you even survive
In Vienna you can get a 70-80 m² appartment for that money
Yes but it's not like you can't afford a car anymore
Besides, using a car in a city like Vienna makes no sense whatsoever (except if you have to transport something large but there are good car sharing services for those instances)
Totally, I also really like London as a city
It just sucks that it's so expensive to live there and not even the higher salaries compensate for that
And time & space
A working fusion reactor
Even the rail network that seems to be favored in this thread would be much more feasible if energy was essentially abundant and free as well as CO2 neutral
Especially with the current climate change threats ahead, I'm not sure if it would be even worth investing billions upon billions in infrastructure that might very well connect a few desertified ghost towns in 2080
Maybe an atomic fusion reactor
Idk how they‘d do that with the Plasma, but I‘m sure it‘d be cool to have a CO2-neutral source of energy, a big one at that, and nothing will happen if something goes down (aka no country will be destroyed by nuclear explosions)
And idk I like the concept of not dying
Interesting to hear this from a swiss person, I feel like something like this would be an EU-project (like the free roaming that was introduced relatively recently)
Though, switzerland has good public transport and trains, so it also makes sense
But I agree, I have thought about this a lot and it was my immediate first thought upon reading the title
Actually Germany just pulled out of one with Austria as it was unable to build a much needed power line through Bavaria
Lacking this line, the whole net was instable and threatened to overload into Poland snd the Czech republic and might have caused a EU wide blackout
So at least for the foreseeable future wind power from the north and alpine energy storage damns cant work together efectivly
>Alternatively a high speed railway across all of Europe
It's in progress
Problem is while Austria and Italy did their part of digging one of the longest tunnels in the world over the last 20 years, Germany still hasn't even decided where they want to build their railway tracks that are supposed to connect us with Northern Europe
I've seen a video once that said building a dam between gibraltar and morocco to drain the mediterranean and/or build a gigantic hydro-power plant would need more concrete than all of humanity has ever used so far
This sounds like an even bigger project
Just privatize a bit more infrastructure, clearly there's some great business opportunity to be had there
The problem is that all the parties that focus on climate change are extremely opposed to nuclear reactors of any kind
Grüß Gott
Very many of the pretty old train stations are terminus stations which are pretty bad for high speed trains
Having to reverse too much costs a lot of time
Science can imagine a lot
With current mainstream materials it is not possible, with current experimental materials it already might be:
Definitely not fusion reactors, only fission ones
Well, there's a guy like that in the book too
;-)
What
They definietly are opposed to any form of nuclear energry
Fission has come a long way and is incredibly safe and Fusion is still entirely theoretical
> What
They definietly are opposed to any form of nuclear energry
Then they would be even against solar, which I don't see any indication of
I didn't find any strong opinions from any party in Austria regarding nuclear fusion, what are you basing your statement on
> Fission has come a long way and is incredibly safe and Fusion is still entirely theoretical
Nice opinion, yet I'm not talking about fission (which would be anyways unconstitutional in Austria for example), but fusion (which also is not "entirely theoretical" at all, just not practical)
I'll check tomorrow, I think there was one prepper guy that ended up being too suspicious and getting killed quickly because he wanted to defend his bunker
> I didn't find any strong opinions from any party in Austria regarding nuclear fusion, what are you basing your statement on
Read the party line from the green party
If you think they‘d differentiate between fission and fusion, you are wrong
They lead the huge missinformation campaign against nuclear energy in the 70ies
Ahhh, I mixed it up in my mind with a completely different book series
If you read the Expanse books, you'll see what I mean
Sorry for the confusion
A little bit different but there is an saying, when the buorocraty have failed you "your could send your complaints/objections to the salt magistrate" (Salzamt) which doesn't exist anymore
For a long time I thought that Balaton was just the Hungarian name for [lake Neusiedl]
I just now found out that Dora The Explorer teaches kids Spanish in the original (through this comment section xD) - it teaches English in Germany and Austria too
Not an entire show but an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants: There is a part in an episode where SpongeBob speaks German in the original version
In the German version he speaks Bavarian
There is an episode in Scrubs where they have a patient who only speaks German, and the blonde Doctor (I forgot her name sry) is the only one who knows the language
In the German version, it was all changed to Dutch instead
[According to this list] she teaches Spanish in the Irish- and the Serbian-language versions
Spanish for Irish makes sense, since most young Irish native speaker probably also know English pretty well
Don't know why in Serbia they decided to go with Spanish, but why not
In the Kannada-language version (language from India) she teaches Hindi
There's also a Maori-language version, Wikipedia doesn't say what she teaches there
I assume most Maori kids also know a certain amount of English already(?), so Spanish would make sense I guess
It also says nothing about the Malayam-language version (Dravidian language from southern India), I suppose it has to be either English or Hindi
All the other versions teach English to varying degree, some of them sprinkle in some occasional Spanish words
She does include some Spanish lingo at times though
They are ***GERMAN*** in the original
... thinking about it, it did kinda make sense, especially their names
I should rewatch Malcolm in English
This wasn't the first thing that came to my mind about this topic, but this is interesting
In the German version, everybody speaks standard German, but Mr Krabs has a very northern German way of talking
Probably because this is Germany's only access to the ocean and a lot of sailors have this way of talking
The old one or the Netflix one
Yeah it would be, but I never thought about it
I thought it was mainly about teaching little, _little_ kids pronounciation or something like that
(And I never thought about the fact that Dora The Explorer was existent in other countries, because I was a child and didn‘t think about what other countries do, so yeah ^ ^ “)
I still don't understand why they felt the need to make a German dub for what is basically a trilingual movie that is already ~30% in German, with some fantastic German-speaking actors at that (August Diehl just appears in one scene, but it's arguably the second best scene in the movie and he completely steals it)
It loses so much of its charme
Also, they just dubbed the English parts, but not the French ones
Oh man yeah, that was a thing
Thinking back, I remember how in Doremi they showed *very obviously japanese Onigiri* and called them cookies
Yeah, I mean why not
Spanish is a cool language
Yes
Dora la Exploradora teaches English to Castillian Spanish-speaking kids
I think Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Hindustani, and maybe Swahili are roughly on a similar level regarding usefulness
Entirely depends on your purpose
When you grow up in a non-english speaking country, american media all just blurrs together
As a kid you don't really think whether a character from a cartoon has this or that nationality
In german, Swiper was still called Swiper, and as a kid I obviously recognized that this wasn't a German name (neither was Boots or Map)
I knew that a lot of shows came from the US, but I didn't think much of it
Actually, and this is my personal impression, due to the fact that American media was everywhere, it felt more like a fairytale land than an actual place
Growing up also meant losing this perception fo the US, but even today I still sometimes hold on and think "There are actual people who were born and live in the US
I don't think most little kids in German speaking Europe would even grasp the concept of "latino". It's not like they explicitly mention it
She speaks German, teaches English, sometimes drops some words in Spanish, and most importantly, has a little monkey friend
Yeah
I think she's supposed to be "pan-Latino" without any specifications (Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican etc
In Austria, you can get a lengthy discussion about food and how to prepare it properly, with a concentration on two topics: Salads and dumplings
The two biggest are probably whether potato salad should or should not contain mayonnaise (and of course it shouldn't, anyone who thinks differently should have their taste buds and/or mental state examined) and whether potato dumplings or bread dumplings are superior (and again, the answer is obvious since bread dumplings are far better at soaking up sauces and don't taste like rubber)
And don't get me started on the cultural differences in food between Austria and Germany
Dear Germans: Putting any kind of sauce on a crackling, crunchy Wiener Schnitzel is an abomination and should (and maybe even will) get you kicked out of a restaurant in Vienna
Why the hell would anyone do something like that
Oh, and it's Erdapfel
Not Kartoffel, it's Topfen, not Quark and it's Schlagobers, not Sahne
Learn your own effin' language, dammit
(In other words, there are a few words that are used for the same object, depending on where in Austria or Germany you are, and of course, the other one is WRONG and they should start learning the proper word for it)
Whether the meat in the lunch bread is called "Fleischkas" or "Leberkas". That's a big thing here
I am a "Fleischkas" eater
The usage of the preamble "ur" draws a clearer line through Austria than any political party and could lead to civil war
What gendered article to use with "Nutella". Some people are wrong and say "das Nutella" (neutral) and some people are right and say "die Nutella" (feminine)
Then there are people who are just crazy and say "der Nutella" (masculine) but they are fortunately a tiny minority
A big divide in Austria but also in Germany is the way you give certain times of a day
Where I live it is like the slices of a pie
10:15 is Viertel elf (Quarter eleven) 10:30 is Half eleven, 10:45 is three quarters eleven
In other places it is quarter past ten, half eleven, quarter before/to eleven
In other areas there is even different forms like Quarter over ten (Viertel über zehn)
So going from region to region you can confuse people quite a bit if they are not used to interact in the multiple forms of time announcement
Another stark divide in Austria and Germany is the use of different decks of cards for the most popular card games and what those games are
The divide is between those who play with German suited cards (Hearts, bells, acorns, leaves) and those who play with traditional 'French' cards (️️ ️ clubs)
In Austria it is mainly Vienna+surrounding areas which plays French vs
everybody else
The time thing also overlaps with the card divide
I'd go with vinegar and oil
In Vienna another variant is very popular, so called 'Vogerl Salat' where field salad is added to the mix
here it’s the same, but with apple strudel
I actually had to think how I'm saying it
But in the end I agree with you
Now there's the question if you put butter and Nutella on your bread or just Nutella
Die / Das Cola
Der / Das Joghurt
Der / Das Pool
Der / Das Radio
Der Nutella
Der Butter
Das Joghurt
Fight me IRL
Look at him/her using "Erdapfel" for other potato products besides Erdapfelsalat (potato salad) and Erdapfelpüree (mashed potatoes)
I bet you also call Tomaten (tomatoes) "Paradeiser" :O
What also divides Austria in two: Is it called "Fleischkas" or "Leberkas"? In Western Austria we say "Fleischkas" in Eastern Austria it's called "Leberkas". But one thing gets us back together: We all love to eat it
I'm from Austria and a family friend told me about how he once was on vacation somewhere in the middle of Germany and he just wanted to buy a Sömmi (that's how we pronounce Semmel) for breakfast and had to discuss for 15 minutes with the store worker until he figured out that a Brötchen isn't a smaller version of Brot (bread) but, in fact, a Sömmi
We're happy to receive any Kina-saying refugees from the weird Ch Germans who obviously must be sick in some way
/r/SchnitzelVerbrechen/
NSFS (not safe for stomach)
Even on that it's an atrocity, what did that poor pig ever do to you to deserve that
I feel like Obelix when those Brits soaked his boar in peppermint sauce
If you use Erdapfel only for certain dishes but say Kartoffel otherwise you are too far gone
I'm afraid there is no helping you anymore
Paradeiser is correct and always will be, fight me
You're right ,for everything else it's Grundbirn
>And just because you went 'eh, it's somewhat the same shape and comes from the ground' doesn't mean Erdäpfel is a good word for Kartoffel
A shit ton of countries calls them ground apples
With Mayo and creme
hurrrrrrrrk
If you get a second helping, the bypass you need is free
And yes, we know it's a misnomer because it contains neither Leber (liver) nor käs (cheese), but who cares, I don't wanna talk with it, I wanna eat it
>allerdings ist ein Schnitzel mit Champignonrahmsoße und Fritten auch geil
You have been banned from /r/Austria
And people wonder why the Japanese think that we're the German speaking nation with culture
Yes, that too, whether the potato salad should be warm or cold is another thing that divides the country
And of course it should be cold
You need something to balance the onions and the oil
Try somewhere outside the tourist centers and you'll be sent packing if you order anything with "Sahne".
Also, you don't get a "Tüte" for your purchases
A Tüte is something you can smoke here (it's the slang word for a blunt)
If you want a bag for your purchases, ask for a Sackerl
In Tyrol we say "Fleischkas". Did you like it
Together with bread (Semmel) it's our standard lunch meal
It's called Semmi
That's a good explanation that I'll be using when my friends complain about it/me again
Thank you
You understand me
Bread, butter and jam are considered as normal
Bread, butter and honey are considered as normal
Why not bread, butter and Nutella
Dos Nutella
Right
It's so good
I could eat 3 of them if I wouldn't explode
SÖMMI KRUZIFIX
Am Austrian, it's both die and der Butter
Mostly I just say an butter, as in "reiss umma an butta du gschissana".
>I've yet to encounter anyone taking the choice of words serious enough outside of outrage articles
Nah its not serious at all
Say whatever you want
The only annoying people are some German tourists
Saying "Haha they say Sackerl instead of Tüte lol" in an Austrian grocery store is pretty rude
Upper Austria
District of Amstetten, so no but not too far off
If Bulgaria is small, what are we
Honestly, not that much I think
Lots of what big countries expect us not to have, we do
We have a strong east/west divide, you have a Bible Belt,...
How about that app of yours which helps you prevent sleeping with one of your relatives :D
Geographically the Netherlands might be small, but they have quite a large population, pretty famous cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam), and are well known in the world
>I have met far more Germans in Austria than I have actual Austrians
Were in austria was this
Holy shit did i ever fall for a hoax :D
The German name of the edible Dormouse is seven sleeper, which points to his long hibernation period
The German name of the Sloth is lazy animal
The German Name of a vole is pointy mouse
Romans and Gauls
I know it sounds fake but they are really literally called Edible Dormouse or Fat Dormouse because the Romans, Gauls and Etruscan hunted and ate them, usually as a snack due to their size
They are apparently still hunted and eaten in parts of Slovenia and Croatia today
Try it and report back :P
I guess they taste mucy like guinea pigs
I don't really know anything special about the occupation
What I collected as inofficial knowledge is that Austria was extremely lucky after WW2
they basically blamed it all on Nazi-Germany and convinced the allies that Austria was a victim in the war (which is absolutely not true) and that and neutrality is what got Austria its freedom
I think there's even a story about an Austrian and a Russian diplomat having a drinking competition and because the Austrian won, Austria soon got its freedom, but I don't know how much of it is true
My home region was  occupied by  France after the second world War
My great grandmother  told my mother that there were  Moroccon soldiers in their village
She told her, they were quite nice to the villagers and behaved friendly
I never got to know my great grandmather she died before I was born, so I knew that only from stories
Edit typos
It's not talked about much and I didn't learn a lot about it in school
We pretty much breezed through it in an hour learning that there was an occupation, which allied country controlled what areas and how difficult it was for them to share Vienna
More focused on the rebuilding efforts, the Trümmerfrauen and how big of a deal rebuilding the Stephansdom was, for some reason my teacher found it really important to focus on that
My grandma (who was just a young kid) told me the soviet soldiers liked to give out chocolate to kids and the americans always gave cigarettes to the adults, that's pretty much all I remember
One thing I recently learned (late night wikipedia reading) is that the americans built huge TV antennas in vienna so that soviet controlled areas around Vienna could get western news
These antennas were in use until 2008 or so
Pretty impressive
Another thing is that the CIA helped form and financed the far right party now called FPÖ. At the time mostly made up of fairly high ranking NSDAP and wehrmacht officials and soldiers
All for fighting communism, eh
One thing that nowadays sometimes comes up is allied memorials
The allied powers made us keep their memorials intact forever after leaving, and we aren't allowed to remove them
A problematic one is a [Stalin plaque] on a house he lived in for a while, built by the soviet occupiers
There is some discussion about if we're allowed to remove it because technically it might not be not a war memorial, but it was built by the red army
Even Chruschtschow asked Austria to remove it after they went through De-stalinization but so far we've at least put a plaque under it to think of the victims of Stalins politics
My hometown (linz) was occupied by the allies south of the danube and north was soviet
In school we just learned that familys had to go trough checkpoints to visit familys in the other side
Thats everything i know about the occupation
The village I grew up in was initially part of the Soviet zone, and the closest town was in the British zone, so everyone going to town had to cross the zone border, which, as my grandmother told me, was quite difficult sometimes
The Soviet soldiers occupied the school in the village so there was no school for a while, but then again school hadn‘t regularly been in session for a bit I guess
The entire province eventually became part of the British zone and for the most part people were relieved that it was British and not Soviet anymore
In the village, many people didn‘t really „feel“ occupied, mostly because it was so secluded and small
I can‘t really say if there is a lasting influence on my province now, except maybe a strange fixation on British English
Oh, and some children fathered by occupying soldiers
My grandmother used to tell us about the girls in the village that got involved with the soldiers - village gossip at its best
The occupation isn‘t really taught in school in too much detail, the books mostly focus on the Staatsvertrag in 1955, but it is definitely something that has been preserved in the collective memory of the village
My grandfather worked in a soviet factory after WWII during the occupation and lived in the soviet sector
Although he was no Nazi sympathizer (he was too young to "participate" in the war and lost his father and brother plus was displaced from his hometown in Serbia, so he just hated the entire war) he disliked the soviets even more
He told me once that they were very happy when the soldiers left
In general, the soviet occupation forces have a very bad reputation
Unfortunately he barely talked about his experiences, I guess way too much trauma
It‘s quite interesting actually
Today you can still see the aftermath of the occupation when you compare the economic power of our western half to our eastern half
GDP per capita is higher in the former regions of the Allied occupation and lower in the former Soviet occupation zones in eastern Austria
Especially in Burgenland, which is the south eastern state of Austria and also the „poorest“ state in all of Austria
One huge reason for this was of course the Marshall Plan the western states of Austria received
Today growing up I learned _so much_ about WWl, WWll, Austria pre-war, Austria during 1918-1938 and Austria post-war
I can‘t imagine anybody not learning as much as I did
(WWll is in most schools a really big subject in 8th grade
For me it took the time of half the school year
) My teacher told me too that everybody should know as much as possible about it, so that something like this never happens again
Sadly my class couldn‘t go to a Concentration Camp like about every other school does because
Now back to topic lol - Division in Austria - I know that my part was inhabited by the brits
There are probably many cities where you can see that, sadly I live on the countryside tho
And sometimes adults are pissed off about the South Tyrols, but I think teens and young adults just joke about it and say _Those dang italians
_ (Just jokes we love our italian neighbors <3)
My grandma use to talk about them as kids hiding from the Soviets in the woods after the war because they would drive around the countryside/villages and while „inspecting“ houses rape girls if they were in the mood
Don‘t know about the other allies‘ sectors though
When I went to school most adults were still pissed about south Tyrol (now part of Italy), albeit I'm pretty sure it was mostly a joke
Also tbh the military is just ridiculous
18+ men are required to join for a year or something, but we couldn't legally go to war anyways, our country is tiny and they mostly provide flood relief (which is great but
come on, Wehrpflicht in case of Hochwasser
Pretty dumb)
Very weird thread
Just Austrian (and one German) top comments and two very weird Hungarian ones
The myth is about Figl
I heard he won a drinking competition with the soviet representative
Looks like it's all BS
It's almost ridiculous how we got away with claiming to get occupied
People helt parades in the street when Hitler's car drove through their town on his way to Vienna
> I think there's even a story about an Austrian and a Russian diplomat having a drinking competition and because the Austrian won, Austria soon got its freedom, but I don't know how much of it is true
Figl and Renner drinking Molotov under the table might have happened, like in their free time or whatever, but it hadn't to do anything with the state treaty and the end of the occupation
It is most certainly a myth
Your Jonathan Frakes
Wir haben zwar nicht versucht, die Annexion zu bekämpfen, besonders erfolgreich wäre eine militärische Auseinandersetzung mit Deutschland sowieso nicht gewesen
Trotzdem wird uns vorgeworfen, uns nicht vergeblich geopfert zu haben
Dass es österreichische Nazigrößen gegeben hat, ist nicht die Schuld des ganzen Landes
Die Heim-ins-Reich-Motivation ist älter als der Nationalsozialismus
My grandmother told the same story, except the French soldiers didn't behave quite as nicely in hers
My grandmother was about 12 when the war ended
One of their neighbors was shot dead when his window shutter jammed and opened with a loud noise, startling one of the soldiers
There were also a fair amount of rapes, something my grandmother became aware of because her father had her do inside chores whenever he could and occasionally ordered her to hide under her brother's bed and keep quiet because sometimes soldiers came (or maybe the same one each time, I'm unsure about that) and asked specifically for her
THE CIA CREATED THE FPÖ? WHHHAAAT THE FUCK
> My grandma (who was just a young kid) told me the soviet soldiers liked to give out chocolate to kids and the americans always gave cigarettes to the adults, that's pretty much all I remember
My grandma's story was that they were hungry and asked American soldiers for food but they only gave them chewing gum
> by the allies south of the danube and north was soviet
The term "allies" in this context always includes the Soviets
The south was US occupied
And the wall didn't help either
Well, while we did indeed make up quite the percentage of nazis in Nazi Germany, it was Nazi Germany and not Nazi Austria throwing the world into chaos
That’s probably the reason why
Wrong war
To answer your question: the land was divided up along ethnic lines in 1919 (Treaty of St
Germain) and the inhabitants were given the choice in local referenda in 1921
The majority opted to go with Austria, because it was mostly inhabited by German and Croatian speakers, and they wanted to be in the same country as their closest biggest cities, especially Fürstenfeld, Graz and Vienna
Sopron/Ödenburg was planned to be the capital of that region, but opted to stay with Hungary
well we technically got occupied apparently, there should have been a democratic voting, about a connection of austria and germany, but hitler couldnt wait so long, so he drove the day before the voting happened to vienna and claimed it german territory
We got away with it because the allies *decided so*. The idea that Austria would be framed as a victim was drawn up by the allies in 1943 - so that they could build a neutral block in the center of Europe, next to Switzerland
It wasn't that they just believed us, for politics of the allies it was just way easier to "believe" that
It was just easier for everyone
Yes, the "we were the poor first innocent victims of the bad, bad Nazis" idea was common until the late 90s, since then we've pretty much stopped that and stand by what happened
I think it's because everyone knew someone who was in the war or with the Nazis at the time
And I understand it must be difficult to think that your own grandfather could have been one of them
It's easier to just tell yourself he did it because he had no choice
I'm sure there were a lot of people who really didn't have a choice but to play along but on the other hand, looking at [pictures of the crowds] on the Heldenplatz for Hitlers first speech tells a story on its own
[Yep] they helped create it with the assistance of a former Hitlerjugend leader and high ranking SS officer Sturmbannführer Karl Kowarik, who the americans just pardoned because he was useful to them
Mich wundert es irgendwie nicht
Well sch is pretty much one letter
Similar to ш. No idea where the rest comes from though
Our spelling is pronounced like крушчов.
So it doesn't look like the already exisiting words Stadt or Statt or statt
Staat is also pronounced with a very long aaaaa so the double a is warranted
German has plenty of words with double a.
e.g. Aal (eel), Aas (carrion) or Paar (pair)
Yes, it‘s a combination of many different factors
Our military is a joke though, even with the draft
Id argue that a professional military would be more cost efficient
We *could* be invaded just like that, that is the whole issue
Our military is a joke
Underfinanced, undertrained, underequipped and more than anything undermotivated
Yeah, Austria joined Germany because of an Ultimatum from Hitler to Schuschnigg, who ordered the military to not resist the Wehrmacht
But yeah, many people were not unhappy about
I mean also who would object, the left was already suppressed and stayed quiet, the Nazi party was the only legal opposition of the autocratic ruling rightwing Christdemocrats and growing steadily in support since the economic crises
Edit: that sounded almost apologistic, I only wanted to say that the Anschluss hasn't happened in a vacuum
Agreed, it's awful and tragic and just horrific how the war, both of them, really, scarred entire generations for life
Die CIA sind die größten Verbrecher der welt
Yeah I know the CIA has/had their fingers in many many places around the world I was just surprised that they did it in Austria too
Shouldn't have been surprised though
No the map says its american
Look at a map where the city of linz is
Yeah we were guilty, but you can’t seriously blame Austria for Hitler being an Austrian
He became Germany’s dictator, not Austria‘s.
Edit: Well technically speaking he did became Austria‘s dictator too*
While I do agree with that, he still was a failed artist while in Austria and in Germany he was a politician
Granted, anybody could fall for his trap, Austrians just like Germans, but Germans fell for it first
Thanks ÖVP for spreading lies and propaganda when we voted on it in 2013
>the Nazi party was the only legal opposition
No, in fact they were made illegal after they killed the former austrian autocratic ruler Dolfuß in 1934 in a failed putsch
After that a lot of austrian nazis fled to Germany, giving lots of "intelligence" (information) to the german nazi party
Others stayed in Austria ready to take orders
When they anschlussed Austria, they already had lists ready with who to imprison first - basically everybody in any leadership position of any political movement was imprisoned before Hitler made his triumphal drive through Austira
Operation Gladio also had a chapter in Austria, you can look it up online
Konsistenz =~/~= consistency, at least not in most cases (excluding geology)
It's like, a half false friend
Konsistenz usually refers to texture or stiffness
E.g. "Die Konsistenz meines Stuhls war heute sehr weich, ich muss wohl mehr Ballaststoffe essen
Consistency in this context is best translated as Konsequenz, Kontinuität, Konstanz or Beständigkeit
Well I usually just respond with: You elected him, we didn't even allow him to study art
Obviously this is not a sincere statement and just joking comeback to those remarks
Austria had its own fascist government at the time
But eventhough the NADSP was illegal in austria, it had a huge base
So that's why nothing was done to stop the invasion of austria
Basically at the time austrians considered themselves german as well
German being ethnicity
So they said they didn't want to have germans shoot germans
But in reality they thought maybe austria will a get a good status in the 3rd reich, as austrians are the better germans
Yea kinda fucked up
So after WW2, austria changed the narrative
Austrians were austrian and not german
The language difference was made more noticable (not the dialects, they already were)
They were declared illegal before the attempted coup, if I remember it right in 1933 when there was an terror act traced back to them, but rhey were made legal again before the Anschluss, at least through the Berchtesgadener Abkommen when Schuschnigg and Hitler met in person, but yeah that was pretty close to the Anschluss
I thought they were made legal before that but it seems I remember it wrong
Edit:
I thought on the [Juli-Abkommen] which forced Schuschnigg to grand the NSDAP members giving amnesty, but it didn't make them legal again
Yeah sorry for not being clear
I meant the southern bank of the Danube in Upper Austria
The NSDAP was illegal for a while, but Hitler pressured Schuschnigg to make it legal again for a promise to ease the political pressure Germany but on Austria (which he of course didn't do)
After we lost the support of Mussolini Hitler had an easy game with Austria
Ok I will think of that next time we‘re supposed to look into the future :3 (I always sound passive aggressive when I use sarcasm, don‘t mind that, I love you <3)
Another interesting facet that I find is hardly ever talked about is that in the phase before the Anschluss Schuschnigg contacted country after country in the attempt to find support for an independent Austria, but nobody was willing to help
Mexico was the only country in the world that was willing to - verbaly - protest the Anschluss, military support was impossible for them however
>  Austrians are trying to blame it all on them though
That is a straight up lie
Up until the 90s yes, nowadays absolutely not
No they're saying that it's BS to say "he was born in austria so it's entirely austrias fault".
Well but he wasn’t? It‘s not even a lie to say that
Up until Anschluss the Austro-Fascist government tried to stop an German annexation of Austria
He did became chancellor after Anschluss, but the Austrian state did de facto not exist anymore
I've repeatedly heard and read that
Sure, we're far from innocent
And unlike in the 50s-80s, nobody says so anymore
But the constant memes about "actually austria started both world wars because hitler was born in austria" are still incredibly annoying
Cordula Grün in Austria
Played all the time and while it's not really a bad song it got annoying
[Hulapalu]
I do not take any responsibility for possible brain or ear damage
Austria - Vo Mello Bis Ge Schoppornou by Hollstuonarmusigbigbandclub
Also funny because it was sung by people from Vorarlberg, the wester most region of Austria and it was sung in such a deep dialect that if you weren’t from Vorarlberg yourself you had a hard time understanding a thing
But the melody alone was very catchy so it became a hit in all of Austria
[Atemlos by Helene Fischer] and [Cordula Grün by die Draufgänger] are both German, but overplayed here imho
Same with [Holz - 257ers] (/were all pretty overplayed)
A truly Austrian song that was really overplayed imo was [Eine ins Leben by Pizzeria und Jaus] But it‘s quite a good song so I‘m not complaining
same in slovakia
this was a huge hit
Fun fact: Aserejé is actually a dadaist/phonetic "cover" of the the first line of Sugar Hill Gang's [Rapper's Delight]
Sugar Hill Gang's
> I said-a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock,
It to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

> Y aserejé ja de je

Sebiunouva
Majabi an de bugui

It's basically the way I sang English pop songs when I was 4 years old
I'm serious, look it up (if you know Spanish you might be aware of that, but it was a huge surprise for me)
I like "Atemlos". I think most people just hate it ironically, because it has been so overplayed
It's a good song though
Alors on Danse
He is such a disgusting creep, I can't even
I‘ve never actually heard Hulapalu on radio, only during festivals
And I hate that thing along with the human that created it with a passion I usually don‘t have
Oh my, mid 2000s German TV Humour
Needs a bit of Stefan Raab with his weird laugh sprinkled on top
Or, you know, because of dementia
Wow, did you guys really have to expose Helene Fischers most passionate fans like that
didn't know that
always thought he was french
sorry
I tend to apologize to even small mistakes nobody cares about due to the fact I'm a rather insecure person who doesn't want to bother anyone
Just want for everyone to have a good time
TLDR; In Austria we have a nuclear power plant
After it was build, the gov asked the people if they want it
People said no
It was never turned on
Wiki: [
Krankenhaus Nord in Vienna
Construction was started in 2010 and the scheduled Opening was 2015, it opened in 2019
The thing that most people remember though is the "Energy Protection Ring".
The city of Vienna paid 95
000(!) Euros for someone to establish a ring of protection around the hospital to protect it from "Bad Energy". Yep high government officials regularly pay for esoteric things with public money
It also costed like 225 Million too much
even better: 50
47% voted against it
&#x200B;
Nowadays it's open to visitors and there is an electronic music festival held annually on the premises of the power plant
[Shutdown Festival]
Today it's used as a quite successful festival venue, so not a completely failed project
I'd mention Kickl's horses though
Germany no upgrading its rail network to account for upgrades in neighboring countries seems like a common theme
We have the same problem with the Brenner Basistunnel
with 5 million people that's around 15 EUR per card, that's not that bad
The real fail I guess is predicting 28 cents per card, shipping is more
> Today it's used as a quite successful festival venue, so not a completely failed project
a roughly 1
6 billion EUR festival venue
Nope
And how fucking ridiculous is stocking up on toilet paper
Like ... do people expect like 2 years of quarantine or what
Having one extra pack, alright, having fucking 10 extra packs ... what the fuck
Well, i needed a dust mask for some home improvement and they are all gone
Yeah, you can barely find any hand sanitizer and no face masks at all, and noodles and flour are almost out in the local store where I live
They still had baby wipes
Those are perishables, so probably those are rebated and it's cheaper than wholesale, and some shop owner went at it
It depends heavily on the family size though
A big family, maybe even with several women, and you use quite a lot of toilet paper in a week
I would say yes definitely
seen many panic buying over the last few weeks
Just flush, dip and wash
They aren't stockpiling, they just started using soap
pro tip: dont shit into fans and you wont have that problem, and can leave some TP for other people
Well, that might be a good a time as any to talk about resource use in the context of taking a shit/piss then
Yeah ... that's the next thing, people stockpiling on mineral water or such
Just why
It's not like even a quarantine means they will shut off your water or electricity or internet
You are just not allowed to go outside
The latter, because that's how throughput works
We do
We're quite happy with it
And you expect anyone noticing that those are three separate links
Women need toilet paper for more than that :)
Really
Shop workers hate it
As a former sales woman I would never ever want to work on Sunday
Not every week then, if you're talking about periods
If you're talking about origami, there's better paper than that
Does not change the fact that basic infrastructure is not gonna break down from something like this
And you think people have nothing else to do
not only period
Some women have a problem with discharge, especially pregnant ones
Oh really
That's interesting
Shop worker is not typically a student job here
Definitely not cashier and the like
Maybe stocking, though not really that either as far as I can tell
I wonder if that directly relates
Like, Sundays have always been closed here in Austria and that's why it never became attractive for students, or if there's a different reason
It is more about having one day they can spend with their family
I can't imagine having a small child but not one full day I can spend with it
Well, there are professionals to deal with the big discharge at the end of a pregnancy called midwifes, but I can see how that'll take a few rolls, yes
Austrian women are pregnant for about a single year in their entire life on average, so I'm not sure that multiple pregnancies at home is a realistic scenario to prepare for
In any case, revisiting and reviewing habits one might have "learned" as a toddler might be in order if you are figuratively burning through toilet paper (in the literal case get a smoke alarm in addition to having a talk)
Having better things to do has nothing to do with being important
Fernweh, is my favourite German one
It is the exact opposite to home sick, the yearning to leave your known surroundings behind in search for the unknown
To me as a German speaking native it is not the same as wanderlust, even though pages try to translate it that way
Wanderlust literally is the to experience the joy of hiking, so I don't feel like the two are describing the same concept
For me in German that would be Heil (or at least it was until the nazis ruined it
Heil describes a state of absolute completeness, health, happiness, well-being and redemption/salvation
The German words for healing, holy and the homonymous adjective (which means safe, unhurt or "in one piece" for objects) are derived from it
It is also still used as a salute among hunters and fishermen (Weidmanns Heil/Petri Heil) or when reaching the peak of a mountain
In Vorarlberg (and I guess in Swiss German as well) people don't use the verb "arbeiten" (to work) but "schaffen" (to create), which I think is pretty dope
Morgenstern
Because has a double meaning
For once the brightest star that‘s seen right before dawn, and also the weapon, Morning Star
I love all of those words ngl
I wouldn‘t even have thought of them
Oh that actually makes sense, thanks for that
It's really interesting how loan words and words in general can change meaning over time
Adolf, just doesn't sound right
Recently somebody told me that they're naming their son Cornelius
It was really really hard to smile and saying that it's a great name
we have more than Adolf
Franz, Erich, Johann, Walter, Karl
I can go on
when my mom said she wants to name my younger brother Julius I was like "Who in the world would give their kid such an old name
", but now I like it much better than Julian
Out of all those, Tankwart still stands out as the worst name ever
Bitte wer wäre das
that is somehow absolutely true
maybe I don't get the question but OP asks for native names, not names from another language converted to your native language, or am I dumb
The Austrian government has that too
I didn't even know that we had a list until I talked to a friend of mine that worked for the government
She also told me that there's a lot of obscure names on it and you even can apply for others, it's just more of a hassle
Technically, not a list
You just have to credibly prove that the chosen name is, well, a name
Source: named a child a couple of years ago
Quite funny for Austria but Josef Ressel invented the world's first working screw propellor for a ship, eliminating the need for sails
Washing your hands after each patient in the hospital, probably
Or Red Bull
One of these
Siegfried Marcus was considered the inventor of the combustion engine
He lived in Vienna during the invention
Due to his Jewish ancestry the Nazis decided that Benz was the inventor
>after inventing whiskey, we took a break for 300 years before inventing anything else
Hardly a surprise :)
uuhm i might be wrong here but I thought the guy who first distinguished the blood groups was an austrian biologist called karl landsteiner
I just realized that Ressel wasn't born in Austria
Frappe is good
According to one of the other posters Ressel wasn't actually born in austria
But afaik the ACTUAL paper clip, the one that is used today (the so called Gem paper clip), was not actually invented by a norwegian [link to wikipedia]
But i do appreciate my cheese slicer
so thank you
And the Rubik cube
Birth control pill and nuclear splitting
For an invention from the "current austrian territory", I think I'd choose the Kaplan-Turbine, which is frequently used in hydropower plants
If you go by that Mozart is actually German
Well, u/Spooodermon did point out "for a ship", so
There was a pretty big push in the 1990s to highlight norwegian achievements
One of the things that the norwegian government highlighted was the invention of the paper clip
They erected a paper clip [monument] and even went as far as issuing a special [stamp] in 1999 (which looks pretty cool)
However both of those dont actually depict [the version of the paper clip that was indeed invented by a norwegian] ended up not gaining traction, because it’s design misses the last bend, making the use of it less practical)
Sauce: late night [wikipedia] scrolling
Interesanterweise sagt die englische Variante der Seite was anderes:
>Current Austrian thinking is that Marcus' first car ran in the late 1880s.[\[3\]] However, early publications suggest that he may have had a petrol powered vehicle running earlier than 1870
[\[4\]]  The deliberate destruction of evidence of Marcus' inventions by the  Nazi regime has left these dates open to debate and speculation
[\[5\]] [Britannica] cites 1864 for Marcus' first car with a 10-year gap to the second, which is consistent with other sources
[\[6\]]
ah ok thanks :))
So robot=slave
Well, not quite
The whole question of „what did your country invent“ is a bit tricky since, as you have correctly pointed out, national boundaries have chamged so much over the years
I get your point, but the difference between Mozart and Ressel is that Mozart was born in what is NOW austria, and Ressel was born in what is NOW the Czech Republic
Based on that, children in the Czech Republic probably learn that he was born in Czech Republic (and therefore consider him a Czech) and kids in Austria learn that Mozart was born in Austria (and therefore consider him Austrian)
No he isn't. He was born in Salzburg, which wasn't part of Germany
That's just something Germans claim
You mean born in Salzburg
Which was not Germany or Austria but its own bishopric in its time
I mean he lived nearly his whole live in Vienna so pretty much an Austrian
Also american
What he's probably referring to is the [Holy Roman Empire of German Nations] which (the Prince-Archbishopric of) Salzburg used to be part of
Still, that the HRE is not the same as Germany
The EU knows the problem and is working on it
But there are many technical differences which would be very expensive to eliminate
Power systems, track gauges, signals, platform heights, etc
There will probably never be a single railway system in Europe
You can only standardize regulations and build multi-system locomotives for certain routes
We already have had so much standardization in the education system
Yeah, university degrees should be comparable - but please dont force all schools in the EU to operate the same way
One of the best things in Austria is that schools have the Autonomy to try out various systems of education
Fuck no
>Are there different track gauges though
I'm only aware of Russia having a different one than everyone else
Spain:
But newer high-speed lines have already been built in standard gauge
Ask your local highway fire department, they likely already have one or two
Isn't it similar to Blockleiter / Blockwart
It's still used as an insult today
I have heard it plenty, especially lately
Even says so on the English and German Wiki
"Blockwart" is literally calling someone a Nazi snoop
I never had the impressions that it's a light insult you'd just throw around
"Blockwart-Mentalität" isn't as bad though
and Kevin
Most germans are begging me to speak propper german, i mean ... why should i speak propper german if i allready speak a superiour version of german
To be real, there are a lot of germans (who don't speak dutch) who understand my dutch better then my dialekt and i find that hilarious
> shit where there's some audio guide I often find the English recording speaks really slowly
That's definitely not an English-only problem
I think that is a general Audio-guide thing
The first two Anno Games and Ori
Not much more I guess
There were some very controversial and very swiftly indexxed [Neonazi games] in the early 90s that came from Austria and Germany
That was among the indicators how soon and how well Neonazis across the world have adopted Computers and the Internet for their organising
Fifa, Assassin's Creed, Battlefield, Candy Crush
But we have both Ubisoft and EA creating games in Romania and there are many more
Some together with other countries (like Sweden), some alone
I backed Kingdom Come Deliverance eagerly since day one
Was a bit disappointed that the main dev is such an alt-right adjacent cunt though
Anno was originally developed by the Austrian company Max Design
Fun fact, the Frontline Gamemod3 for World of Tanks was/is developed by a company in Austria
I visited a university lecture by the CEO of that company
Very impressive and interesting
You forget that [JoWood] was an Austrian publisher
They published well knwon games like Gothic, Spellforce and Inustry Giant
Don't forget slot machines :/
There was Ski Challenge
But I don't think it still works
Probably only well known in Germany and Switzerland back in the days
You smell werse than a dozen ro''en eggs drenched in a burrel of vinegur
It was a cult game back then but nowadays nobody seems to remember
Sometime in spring, I believe March or April, the Icelandic(?) President recorded a message for all Eve Online Players
I believe you can find it on YouTube
The first two Anno games were Austrian actually
Idk which exactly
But we (romanians) worked on the franchise
Sadly Vavda shows a pattern of alligning with [alt-right] [talking points] and [people]
Nero was the old twitter handle of pedophile alt-right firebrand Milo Yinnopolis and the chap in the first pic is alt right darling James Damore
He also really likes Paul Joseph Watson of Breitbart fame
As someone working professionally in history it is a record scratcher when somene makes a "realistic" (which is nearly impossible) game about history, makes sweepung statements about history especially in regards to talking points about whiteness and women in opposition to the opinion academics that are immersed on the subject (who then get nunerous death threats from gamer gaters) and then turns out to like people who are "race-realists", talk about the "jewish question and are in favour of stopping "white replacement" (which basically means holocausting everyone who is not "white")
He is the main dev, his vision and beliefs influence the game
Especially when we talk about something like a reconstruction of and narrative about historical events
And when the visionary behind the peoject has ties to the newest iteration of white nationalism it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth whenever you play
You may declare the artist dead, but even the death of the artist does not wash away the vision invested into the artwork  during its creation
How much closer can you be if you twitter like and repost alt right guys like Milo, Paul Joseph Watson and are an avid GamerGater
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is most likely a duck
Well, still better than Nazi train simulator
Well, for some people you move their destination is literally the final station
Horse meat is pretty good though
Yeah
That's a problem then
Reminds me of Lidl selling horse meat lasagna
Did they know it was horse meat
I thought the deception was on the side of the slaughter houses or the meat distributors, not the retail sellers
If you enjoyed Dark, then you may also like the hacker-thriller "Who Am I". It's by the same directors
I really enjoyed it too, it is also very popular among my friends
I think Germany has some good actors, but most of the series/movies have a boring plot (detective in a rural town style, there are 1000s of these)
Like everybody knows it is some subpar shit, but people just accepted it
I'm very happy that with Dark and Babylon Berlin the niveau is finally getting better
Lupin (fr) is also really good
I'm about halfway into the ahow and I love it
If you like heist shows/liked the feeling of Sherlock, definitely check it out

Thanks to you you guys we look like the Shiba Inu puppy of nations, when really we always have been more like a really bitter, bitchy, and psychotic old house-cat
We start a world war
You get the blame
A guy from here starts another one
He did it as German chancellor
We get an ultra right wing government
Your extreme right murders people
People from both our countries commit a huge genocide
You pay all the reparations
Thanks for all the trade
Thanks for all the trash-TV that makes us feel better about ourselves
Thanks for coming after us in the alphabet (at least in English), so when the both of us get 0 points in the ESC, we can still say "at least we beat the Germans".
Thanks for losing that one football game that one time in 1978
It really means a lot to a lot of people
Still
You are a weird ass and neurotic people, but at the end of the day you are a really great country
Even though your people do so many tiny things that I absolutely can't stand (mainly linguistically, but also some habits), I can't help it but love all of you
Maybe I feel like I have to, maybe it's just fate
Kinda like a sibling
Thanks for that
And **THANK YOU** for giving us Dirk Stermann
[He's] a [national treasure]
Thanks to Switzerland for Rösti and being my partner‘s homeland

Thanks to Hungary for more great food and also an awesome captial city and awesome language
Thanks to Slovenia for the pretty Lippizaner horses and for letting us keep the name Käsekrainer (my favorite late-night Würstelstand snack)
Thank you Germany for taking the blame on WW2 and letting us tell ppl that Beethoven is Austrian
Thanks Germany for taking the main blame for Hitler
But Ljubljana has an Ikea doesn't it
TIL Switzerland is the EU
Hitler never considered himself Austrian and hated Austria and the Habsburg
He didn't even serve Austria in WW1
Doesn't sadly excuse those who collaborated with him
thanks czech republic for the beautiful cities and castles
krumlov is almost my second home
love the Böhmerwald region
No but I only can speak for your gas stations, really
(And supermarkets which are quite lovely)
I imagine their blueprints looking like their instructions
Ah okay
If you like details so much, you shouldn't forget that Hitler lost his austrian citizenship in 1914 when he went to WWI for Germany
So, Hitler wasn't Austrian for 24 years before WW2 started
Isn’t it 20 for 10 days
To be fair if they charged less many people would just use it as a free Autobahn (and the roads are better than most German roads)
Almdudler is already mentioned
[Latella] is a whey drink with various fruit juices
In Romania it’s Frutti Fresh
It’s this highly artificial, yet tasty soda brand, that basically has all the flavours that Fanta doesn’t over here: Grapefruit, Pear, Peach, Grape and of course Tutti Frutti
Almdudler is a sweet carbonated soft drink made from herbal extracts
IIRC second most popular drink after Coca-Cola
There is also Murelli, which comes in many different varieties, which is sadly not as popular as it deserves to be
I particularly love orange & passion fruit and rhubarb & mint
Not from Austria, but [Frucade] is generally considered to be a cult drink in Austria and southern Germany (produced in Bavaria)
Other than that maybe [Almdudler]
Just searched through the comments
Yeah, the Germans and Austrians said about everything we have around here except one I haven‘t seen: [Mezzo Mix] It‘s known as Spezi, except that Spezi is more of a name that is used for all brands (e.g. Cola) whereas Mezzo Mix is more of a specific brand (e.g. for Cola - Coca Cola or Pepsi
Not sure if Himbeerkracherl (raspberry soda) is a common thing outside Austria
[Club Mate] was really popular with IT nerds, I'm not sure how popular its today
Luckily we find Cockta in the supermarket in Austria too
I prefer it over any other cola for sure
A Kebab, spicy with everything and Ayran is probably the phrase I said most often in my life
Also Traubisoda or Schartner Bombe
But those are smaller
Rauch Eistee
Eistee ist probably available somewhere else, but that Rauch quality
Also Makava
Don't forget Frucade
It's a German brand, but the formula they use in Austria is very different (fruiter and sweeter), and 100x better than German Frucade
Is Murrelli even available Austrian wide
Which exists all over the world
Interesting
Almdudler is Austria's national soft drink
But I'd try apple-Almdudler
If I ever get to Namibia, that's definitely on my list
Almdudler already made it that far north
I'm surprised
It's a thing in Austria too
We have it in Austria too
Oh yeah, I totally not thought of Schartner Bombe even it was a favourite of mine as child
Also "Rotes Kracherl" but that's simplt Raspberry lemonade
Yeah, I don't know what they do different, but no other bottled iced tea compares, most don't even come close
They even managed to make the sugar free version taste good
Personally I can only assume they have a contract signed in blood lying around somewhere
I think Merkur has it Austria wide now
At least I have been able to get it in Carinthia and Vienna
And they have an online shop where you can order a case with 12 bottles of whatever you want
When I was a kid my dad always brought a case or two when he was in Murau
I guess the appeal was that it was the most caffeinated drink before Energy drinks were available
Also a looooot of Turkish bakeries and speciality shops
The Turkish diaspora is a mighty fine culinary ambassador
I‘m from Styria, but I haven‘t ever seen or heard of Murrelli
Maybe I‘m in the wrong part or I just don‘t go to Merkur often enough /: (My Merkur in my region closed and now I gotta drive to the next big city to go to Merkur)
You can't buy apple juice and carbonated water in the netherlands
Malzbier is often non alcoholic and I've seen it rarely outside of German speaking countries
But I guess it's not even thaaat popular here
That's cool to hear
I have been to Germany only a couple of times in my life, and I hadn't seen it
Nor expected to see it honestly
Do you have any Italian shops near you
They would probably have it
Unless they are as Italian as "Italian restaurants" in the US
>not in one bottle
I have never seen that either, still that drink is a staple here
It's not rocket science: Grab a glass, fill it half with apple juice and half with mineral water (containing CO2)
Voila, you have Apfelsaft gespritzt, or how they call it in Germany "Apfelschorle"
I've honestly never seen that
Schlampen lasagne
Maybe I just don't watch channels that are big enough to have subtitle translators (because this "feature" seems to be tied to that)
It’s not at all a taboo to talk about it
Yes, there are some people that don’t like it, but it’s not really something you would not talk about
Talking about the Nazi regime is not taboo at all
Glorifying it is very taboo, and in certain cases also illegal
Talking about the Austro-Fascist dictatorship under Dollfuß and Schuschnigg that preceded the Nazi-regime, is definitely more touchy
There's not really any casual discussion you could have about the third Reich
Everyone is on the same page, really
Nice username btw
But tbf we get taught a lot about it in school (at least I did) so it may be touchy, but we still do talk about it
In Austria, and afaik it's the same in Germany, the nazi period is covered heavily in school and while I disagree with censoring Nazi imagery in video games, it's not done to sweep that period under the rug
>While it is perfectly fine to talk about the Nazi reign in Germany, saying sth like "if Hitler was in charge, the trains were on time
" would not be acceptable
I have heard jokes like "I can do whatever I want, because I built the Autobahn
" making fun of neo-nazis and it's pretty much the same thing
Or ironic statements like "This wouldn't have happened under Hitlers reign
", also pretty common
People joke about it sometimes, but it's definitely not a complete taboo
It always depends on who makes a joke, too
The closer you are to a subject, the more you can get away with
I mean, *I* can joke with my husband about our child's perceived flaws
If *you* would do that, you'd not see the next day
Similar with historical trauma
One man's very welcome comic relief is another man's super insensitive boundary stomp
Yes that is right
"Is ja ned alles gut was der Hitler gmacht hat" is another joke I hear, and say, occasionally
For those not in the know:
It means "not everything Hitler did was good" and is making fun of the saying "not everything Hitler did was bad". It's not something I'd say to my boss, a stranger, or my girlfriend's family, but among my friends and my family it always gets a laugh
Another example of german humour
The only game that's really available in my native language is minecraft lol
If I speak the original language then I will play it in that language
With most of my games that is English
German dubs are usually quite good though
I have one game where the main character talks in a cringy fake Southern accent, the German dub is much better
I once set my Steam language back to German to try it out and now play most games in German, here a table for what 'most' means:
high budget: probably good "dubbing" -> german
medium budget: prob
bad "dubbing" -> english
small budget: usually no importantvoice acting -> ger
tiny budget: probably very bad translations -> english
Also puns
Some wordplays simply dont translate
Farmers, people who speak dialect, have an obsession with tractors
A very big obsession
But tbh everybody around here is from a rural area, is a farmer etc etc
Here people who live in a city and aren‘t farmers are considered weird
Especially those that speak no dialect at all
But we don‘t have a fight with each other or smth
>liberal Munich
Did you just use the American "liberal"?
Yes but the only people who say "liberal" when they mean "social liberal" are Americans
So because of you German flag I wasn't sure, if you called Munich a center-right city or just used the American association
Why would you argue it's more correct
It said „liberal“ before he edited it
>And Americans aren't the only ones using that terminology
Canada comes to mind as another country were liberalism almost exclusively refers to "social liberarlism".
Who else does
Latin America and Europe do not
>"Liberal" also has the meaning of being an open/tolerant society, which is also the way I used it pretty much
True, but US politics sadly dominate the internet
I speak a German dialect and for people in my area it takes active effort to switch to standard German
At this point it feels more natural to speak English with my friends than standard German, just because I don't ever use it while talking
Most people are proud of it, but the downside to it is that my girlfriend, who's learning German, can't understand anything anyone here says and it's certainly making it a lot harder for her
I really do think that both her and my life would be easier if dialect wasn't so widespread here
No, this is the first time I've seen either of these
How are you folks reacting to that snow
I mean, you might not be that used to that stuff and be quite amazed, are you
Snow of course is common here in Austria, but even I am still quite amazed about how beautiful it is when there is a lot of snow (I live in an area which doesn't have that much snow usually, but we've got a lot of it on thursday and it was just beautiful)
So, Russian
;-)
Here in the alps sunrise is at around 8am and sunset is at around 5pm
Plenty of day left after sundown
Luckily this all happened on a weekend, right
Are you folks in a lockdown at the moment
This might help ease the chaos too
Imagine this happening on a weekday during normal, busy times
But there simply is something about snow that makes people feel good about it
(if you are not in an area which has snow ALL the time, then you quickly get annoyed by it)
thank you for the information
I have to say that 30cm of fresh snow would even (and have in the past) cause problems here in Austria in large cities
And we all have winter tyres on our cars (they are mandatory for these road conditions)
But they won't help that much when the snow is wet or mushy
(still gets very slippery)
At least the people are also having fun with the snow, which is great to see
They should just remember to stay safe and not hurt themselves
Other than wartime stuff and controlled explosions (tearing down buildings or in mining), probably an accident inside a FLAK-tower in Vienna 1944
Apparently there was an ammunition depot up there, that blew up because somebody mishandled something
It blew a considerable [notch] into this otherwise [pretty indestructible structure] (I'm not exaggerating, those towers are truly and awe-inspiringly hardy)
Several floors are missing
Either that, or some some [gas explosion] but that happens every few years sadly
Guys, if you wanna commit suicide, please don't do it like that
But those are all things that are measurable in my imagination
Like, I can imagine it happening, and why and how big
But that in Beirut is just beyond anything
So fucked up
I wish my country helps, so the Lebanese won't experience a huge famine catastrophy there (a lot of the country's wheat was blown up)
Italy: i love your way of life, your capacity to enjoy good and beautiful things, be it food, cars or fashion
France: as much as i'm sometimes taken aback by it, i also admire the pride you take in being French
We don't do that here
Greece: look at your heritage
Wow
Portugal: one of my earliest vacation memories is going there and i've wanted to go back ever since
And see Nazaré.
Spain: thanks for all the fruit you provide us with
Germany: your way of pragmatically running things right without much of a fuss is awesome
Croatia: as long as we have you, i couldn't care less to go on vacation at some fancy, far away destination
Your country is beautiful, your food is excellent and it's decidedly low-key
I like that
Switzerland: you've got direct democracy dialed
Netherlands and Denmark: your bicycle infrastructure is inspiring
Belgium: your beer is the best beer in the world
You're also home to my favourite racetrack Spa-Francorchamps and of course the best chips
Sweden: i couldn't afford to furnish my home if it wasn't for you guys
Norway: what can i say, you're probably best off of any country in the world
Also fjords
Finland: Saunas are life
Your racing drivers are unbelievable
Scotland: if i only had one alcoholic drink for the rest of my life it would be your singlemalt whisky
Also you're tied for my favourite language with
Ireland: you make some of the most beautiful music ever
You're all poets at heart, so i imagine
England: i love your quirkiness, your humour, your not taking yourselves too seriously
You brought us Lotus cars and Monty Python
And - this is going to be marmite for some - Marmite
If i were ever to move to another country, it would very likely be yours
&#x200B;
EDIT: thank you to u/joelherman for starting this series of loveletters to one another
love reading all the comments
beautiful idea, beautiful outcome
we need more of this kind of stuff
there's so many good things about each and every place, it's important we're reminded of those every now and again
Poland: you have many beautiful cities like Wroclaw, Kraków, Gdańsk and so many more
Also all people are really nice and when I tried to speak polish they were even more friendlier
France: I love the eating culture, French people seam  to enjoy their meals really and are not in a hurry
You also have one of the best culture
Spain: Spanish people are really outgoing and in general easiegoing
Btw I had some of the best parties with Spaniards
Italy: you have one of the most beautiful languages in the world
When you are talking it sounds just like a song, even though I don't understand a word I could listen to it always
At the risk of sounding incredibly immodest: yes
From our point of view, you seem to do everything just a tad better than we are
Not everything of course, but a lot
From the outside in you only see the things that are running better than at home
If you had a good idea in politics, we'll copy that and make it just a little less good when implementing it
If you had a bad idea, well, we probably had it before
Obrigado
Same here
Have done it since earliest childhood and still enjoy it
I usually drink milk/cholocate milk in place of coffee
However, I suspect I may be slightly lactose intolerant because I often feel like shit after
Love Milk
But only normal not light or long life milk
Best is directly from the farmer but thats very hard to get in the city
Unpasteurized milk, yes
But to me it's not a drink, it's food
I'm not fond of the after effects but the taste is good
I LOVE milk, i dink it literwise whenever I‘m home, god do I love milk

"Am Arsch der Welt" - the ass of the earth

I work in a retirement home (as part of my civil service)
Situation was kinda bonkers yesterday, the closing of the Slovakian border hit us hard (we have a lot of nurses working in Austria and living in Slovakia)
Basically it's now forbidden to leave the country (I don't even know if that's legal), no holidays, and extra shifts
Also we are running low on desinfectant
So fun times ahead
Edit: Apparently our government worked with our Neighbors on letting those nurses pass the border again (with checks)
Small victories
Well, its definitley legal to close the borders
but the order not to leave the country comes from our Employer not the Goverment
Conscripts can't be sent out of the country afaik, and as we are not in a war ourselves it's not really dangerous to be a conscript
It's just mostly boring work without any benefits for society and shit pay
Hm, can't think of anything
Historical flack:
- Nationalsocialism
Austria didn't exist from 1938-45, and was part of Germany, but many Austrians were high ranking Nazis
A lot were illegal Nazis before 1938 (the NSDAP was illegal under the clerical-fascist Dollfuß/Schuschnigg-regime 1934-38), after the Anschluss those were the most fanatic Nazis, and they were considered the most loyal ones
- Imperialism
Austria never really was a colonial power, still it was a big empire and German Austrian as well as Hungarian elites treated the other peoples of the empire (but also their own) like shit
Also, Bosnia was essentially a colony, even if it wasn't *really* a colony
The way that the Austro-Hungarian elites pitted the orthodox Serbs, the catholic Croats and the muslim Bosniaks against each other in order to maintain power was reminiscent of British rule in India
I remember when I found out a few years ago, I was absolutely shocked that no one even talks about this
I also think that Amsterdam kinda got that rep for how they deal with drugs in general
Well, I think many countries do, just often it's not publicly known
&#x200B;
Nobody can tell me that in countries like China, US, Brazil etc
, no single person secretly imprisons family members for a long time
I dont know about tge rest of the Netherlands
The regular-Josef supporters: most probably became Nazis, otherwise arranged themselves with the new regime, or just shut up about it
So basically what everybody else did
The actual politicians of the Christian-Social Party (i.e. the leading force behind the move to Austro-fascism): they became Nazis, otherwise arranged themselves with the new regime, fled, or were sent to concentration camps along with their socialist arch-enemies
Adding to the other answers, look at eg
&#x200B;
This is the center of a major Austrian city, from above
Of course not the whole city looks like that, but in any case, a skyscraper wouldn't fit in at all
There is simply no need for them
We don't need to expand into the height, because our cities had a long long time to form
Also they dominate the view and very often look like shit
In Vienna, there are designated areas where skyscrapers can be built, but it's made sure they are far away from the city center and can't obstruct the view towards the inner city
Here, there are pretty strict regulations concerning height and overall look as well
I think the main argument is that skyscrapers next to buildings like the Hofburg, Grazer Uhrturm, Hallstatt/Hallein or other historical buildings that are extremely old-style just doesn‘t look right
Also I think the fire department would appreciate it too, if we don‘t have too many skyscrapers
I'm gonna warm up something from 10 years ago: [KROCH MA EINE
Vorder meiner, hinter meiner, links, rechts güts net
Ich komme
Before me, behind me, left, right doesn't count
I'm coming
There are many ways to say it here but the most direct one would be „Fertig oder nicht, ich komme
And it’s worse with the dialect: „Featig oda ned, i kum
>das „Oida“ (*Alter*) wird auch ohne sichtbaren Zusammenhang fast jedem Satz vor- oder hintangestellt
Wikipedia wieda amal faktisch unschlagbar lol
I think it's pretty much the same in Austria, or at least the part I'm from, "Versteckt oder nicht, ich komme" ("Hidden or not, I'm coming")
"sorry, we didn't know your aircraft was supposed to be invisible"
Oida
I mean, we didn't use standard german either, I just used it here for convenience/ease of understanding
What we actually said would be something like "Fasteikd oda ned, I kim/kum". :b
I mean, I get what you mean, but standard german is what people most commonly write in for a reason
I generally want people from Vorarlberg to understand me too, and vis versa for example
Not to mention non-Austro-Bavarians
In international waters it seems like the obvious choice, like, that's what it's there for
Plus, especially for things that are not just used by one (sub)dialect group, like this, I feel it makes sense to use standard as a way to "generalise". I know that the Burgenländer I live close to wouldn't pronounce it the same, for example, but they do use the phrase too
If I wrote in my sub-dialect and claimed it was what was used "in Austria", that would be more incorrect imo than saying that this standard German phrase is what is used
I guess you could add "but in dialect" after everything
But I doubt I'd think of it/remember, because it's so obvious to me that noone actually normally speaks perfectly proper standard German, especially not in Austria, that's weird, who does that
Also, ya know, not everyone can actually write dialect properly, myself included
There are actual rules for that, apparently, and I do not know them well enough to use them properly
Like, I'm pretty sure the spelling of Versteckt should be closer to "Vasteckd" or even stay "Versteckt", but neither properly show the pronunciation, so the point to writing in dialect instead of standard would be lost, while the way I spelt it gets the point across decently but looks wrong and probably still sounds off too
Like, do you actually pronounce "Versteckt" properly where you're from, or is the spelling just the same
And if it's just spelling, why bother
Agree to disagree I guess
Its nice you can read allemanic, but I have had a lot of trouble with it
I am very far to the east and I don't hear allemanic often at all, so I'm barely familiar with it
That's likely different in tyrol
Also, (Austro-)Bavarian has literal rules with grammar, spelling and all, I'm pretty sure they are actually written down and everything
Otherwise something like the Bavarian Wikipedia site would be kinda hard to do decently
Obviously the details for the pronunciation and mild deviations for spelling vary, similar to middle high German, but also like middle high German there are rules and not using them right makes sentences feel kinda off
And that spelling is also usually a lot closer to the standard spelling than what "phonetically" doing it would be
And if the only thing that changes is pronunciation, there is no point in writing dialect
No word I ever write is normally pronounced as it is written and intended
Not even by Germans from what I've witnessed, nobody i have ever met naturally pronounces words the perfectly right intended standard way, even if some of them try very hard
Because that's weird, it sounds weird
But that's also kinda the point I was trying to get at
We do absolutely use words like "ich" and "komme", those are common German words, it's just that nobody pronounces them that way
In written German, "ich", or occasionally "ick", especially further north, have been used for a long time, even though read aloud/spoken people would say "I", "Ig", "Ih" or whatever else
Because the spoken language/pronunciation, and the written language, meant to be legible in the next village over, are not the same
That's why I asked if you actually pronounce "Verstecken" as intended
Because you probably don't. The spelling just doesn't show that
And the "standard" way of spelling in (Bavarian) dialect is not much better from what I can tell
So what's the point in writing in dialect if you can't tell properly anyway because this alphabet can only convey so much
Even when spelling it closer to pronunciation that problem stays, plus now the words look/feel really weird
The only way to half way better get the point across while not looking really off would probably be to write in phonetic script, and I don't know how to do that
Also, my dialect is still not representative of even eastern Austria or Styria
There are too many dialects
It would be just as dishonest and weird to claim any specific dialect as the "Austrian" way as it would be to use the Standard one
Especially because Standard German is just kinda naturally replaced with umgangssprache or dialect in my head, while dialect is just needlessly specific dialect
So since the difference between written and spoken is usually so big/noticable anyway and there are a lot of possible pronunciations because 300+ (sub)dialects, it makes sense to me to use standard spelling when writing a generalised example like this
That's kinda what standard spelling is there for
Standard Austrian German is austrian
It's not the same as German standard German either in grammar or in spelling
"Ich komme" is valid Austrian German
In this case it also happens to be valid German German, but that doesn't change the fact
Also, my dialect is Bavarian, with Saxonian influences (and the occasional mispronounced slavic or hungarian term) If Austrian German doesn't count, neither should Bavarian
To the best of my knowledge, all german speaking children learn their respective standard similar to a foreign language, so I get where you're coming from with that, but to say it's a foreign thing entirely just isn't right
It doesn't sound right spoken because it's not really a "natural" language, but it is Austrian
I am reasonably sure the "proper" spelling for "ollwail" is "allweil" or "alleweil". Less common than "immer", but i am pretty sure it's a real word, like, in the dictionary and all
"Immer" would just be "imma", I don't think I've ever used anything else, ollwail is more something that, like, my grandfather might say if that
I also don't see the difference between pronouncing "aber" "owa" and pronouncing "ich" "I". At least "I" shares a letter with "ich". There are terms I've only ever heard in dialect/that might only exist in dialect or at least wouldn't know how to translate, but non of those are involved here
This is pretty much just pronunciation, which in german tends not to match spelling
It never did, even before standardisation
I generally translate or not based first on how weird or off the standard would sound, and then how understandable the word is
I could see maybe not wanting to translate "kukaruz" into "Mais" for example, since that's literally not the same language, though I probably would still write "Mais" for something like this since variants of "Moazen/Mais" are much more common to my knowledge and used in my region as well so it doesn't sound totally off
Or I'd probably write "Erdapfel" instead of "Grumba". But I wouldn't translate "leiwand" or "oida", even though oida  clearly just means "Alter". Cause it'd sound too weird
If it doesn't sound too off and is semi understandable I generally use Standard or Umgangssprache for writing, unless it's, like, a text message or something like that maybe
Admittedly I usually write in Umgangssprache, not proper standard, too
I just prefer using the standard when giving more generally meant examples like this
Mind it
I welcome it, as long as they don't do it to make fun of us
I am always  happy when a German who lived here for some time adopts the essential phrase " es geht sich nicht aus" I don't know how you can live without it
Edit: fucking English keyboard won't let me write in German
I'd rather have them adapt
But nothing is more annoying than Germans in Austria laughing at Austrian words like "haha lol 'Sackerl' learn German please"
It's more annoying if they don't do it
You can keep your Tüte
I mean, like, it helps, a lot
But not if they use a forced dialect, that‘s just awful
Like, Germans are often fascinated by my (or Austrian in general) dialect (working in a restaurant, during holidays Germans often come here), and I mean, it‘s fine that they are and often fun, that they ask me how we call certain things, but p l e a s e don‘t try to butcher our dialect, especially if you can‘t speak certain sounds
(I‘m thinking of a certain conversation I had: „Hey, what do you call this
*holds up a chopping board* - Me: „ Br-ä-idl“ - She: „br-A-itl
“ — and I tried to correct her and she continued to call it that and god fucking dammit it really annoyed me (I know I sound rude but come on
Again, if they use our vocabulary it‘s fine for me, because especially working in a restaurant, as said lol, it helps, sometimes
Ofc I know the proper german words for the thing, but sometimes my brain just flatlines and I‘m just staring at the person for minutes and forgot what it was
(Apfelschorle, Traubenschorle, Weinschorle are often words where my brain flatlines lol)
And I have to adapt to the German vocabulary when I‘m in Germany too, because they barely know certain words or have never heard of them
Kren, Gelsen, Erdäpfel, Polster, Spatzen (no, not the bird) to name a few words my German friends often ask me about
The interesting part is of this is, that us Austrians often don´t even know that a word is not used in "German German". For example: We use "Jänner" for "Januar". My ex-gf is from Hannover and she needed some time to adapt to certain words that are just normal for us here
Or when we say something like "Dreiviertel Vier" for 15:45h. Or the word "ein bisschen". And then there´s the word "eh" which is a story for itself
:D and that´s just the ones I can think of now, there for sure are many many more
Reminds me when I tried to buy Semmeln in a German bakery
The making fun part is one thing
What is more common in my experience is the condescending way of telling the Austrians and Swiss they don't speak "proper German". Like german German would be the proper one
I find that super annoying
(Never happens with Bavarians, I guess they might be told the same)
I remember one german co-worker being very annoyed because the baker he went to was talking English to them all the time
I wonder why :-D
Yes
I was shocked when I first heard that Germans don‘t use that phrase
Like, how can somebody possibly live without it
I think Portemonnaie is in the German vocabulary/dictionary
But damn, that‘s interesting
Now I have one reason more to be overly interested in hearing swiss german (not speaking it tho, I will 100% butcher it)
nope, not at all
since people would probably recognize your accent anyway, as long as you don't speak 100% in cockney to everybody and expect them to understand what you say, you'd be fine
nope, not at all, since people would probably recognize your accent anyway
as long as you don't speak 100% in cockney to everybody and expect them to understand what you say, you'd be fine
Baasst, gemma mochma, des wird a Hetz
I wanted to ask you if you‘re from Bavaria until I saw the flare-
But yeah, your dialect is pretty similar to ours, so I understand why Austrian won‘t change it, you‘ll probably understand us nonetheless (I think
They basically ask if eg German still as example: A german would mind if an Austrian would speak AUSTRIAN German and if an Austrian would speak German German
E.g. for me - if I would mind a german saying gespritzter Apfelsaft, Kren, Gelsen, Erdäpfel, Polster, etc etc or if a German would mind if I say Apfelschorle, Meerrettich, Mücken, Kartoffeln, Kopfkissen, etc etc
Also, no, that‘s not how languages work
A federal state is not more important than a country
Especially when the country is older than the federal state
Swiss people also don‘t speak Vorarlberger German, they speak Swiss German
Just like Austria doesn‘t speak Bavarian German, but Austrian German
Bavaria probably doesn‘t even learn words like the ones mentioned above in school and it would be wrong to write them down, while for us they’re literally in our dictionary
Surely nobody would call a Krapfen a Pfannkuchen, no
A Pfannkuchen is flat and not filled with anything
I hate it when they pronounce the word "Palatschinken" like this "Palat-Schinken". That´s not at all how this is pronounced here
In Vienna the waiters beat you
Grüß Gott is the normal polite greeting, I would appreciate it
"Baba" is used very informally or towards kids, so better not use that
Even "Tschüss" sounds way too informal to me, always made me queasy when I heard it being used in business settings
Probably because our local variant "Tschau" is only used with friends
If it's strangers, I think the only correct way to say Goodbye would be "Auf Wiedersehen" (Especially if you're not comfortable using the more local/colloquial "Auf Wiederschaun")
I know what you're talking about
great way to put that feeling in words, thanks
I really feel your pain
Due to Youtube, it's really bad with Austrian kids and germanisms these days
Love it how you use 4 words for meat patty in Germany and non of them are used in Austria
Fleischlabberl Masterrace
My ex gf definitely didn´t know the word "Jänner" for "Januar" and asked me about it
And the excessive use of "eh" is not common in northern Germany neither I think
(or at least in Hannover, which I would consider an area with a very strong "Hochdeutsch")
Oh, and then there was this time when I really really insulted a waiter in Hannover when I said that serving the soup and the main dish at the same time was "vollkommen idiotisch" and never before I had to tell a waiter that I would not like to have them served at the same time before as it wouldn´t make any sense at all
His reply "Nun, wenn ich so ein Vollidiot bin" showed me that he did take that too literally, while here it wouldn´t be considered that awful but more as a figure of speech
(of course I apologized and told him that this was a misunderstanding and tipped well afterwards)
Heast, des schreibt ma "Laberl". Ein B.

This is also true for the first two things on the list:
Brötchen is Weckerl (Semmel is a certain type of white bread Weckerl)
Metzger is Fleischhauer
I would just say "Auf Wiederschauen". Tschüss is ok when coming from a German though, then it is not considered rude
"baba" is too informal though normally
Not if it's not kids I think
We normally say Tschau, you can guess where that comes from
I wouldn't have spelled it "Labberl" like the other commentor, but "Laberl", as the "a" is long
labbrig is used in this context but „labberl“ als in Fleischlabberl refers to a form of the word „Leib“ or „Leibchen“
yeah, came here to say, that they are called faschiertes laberl
Es kommt von "Laib" Leiberl kommt von "Leib"
> I forget to ask about that, I'm from Berlin and here it means something like "sowieso", does it maybe have a different meaning in Austria
We use it really really much and the meaning can vary
For example: "Hast du das eh schon gemacht
" which doesn´t translate to "sowieso" at all
It roughly means: "Hast du das bereits gemacht
". Just one example that comes to my mind, I am sure there are many others
I think this was the one she struggled the most with
yeah but that's spelled "Laberl" buddy, not "Labberl". or were you thinking of a "Lapperl"?
IIRC Franco changed Spain's timezone to CET to be in the same timezone as the Third Reich, but that might be anecdotally
Did the Spanish always eat dinner as late as now, or do you think that's a consequence of the timezone you're in
You need to watch more Karambolage
Wait, what
Do they really do that
I personally only do some peaceful shopping, buying beer, kofola and some slovak food
They probably started the habit to go to duty free shops between the countries and now that there is no border keep on driving to the next slovakian store
Are they going on a sunday
Then it will be shoppoholics that think of buying stuff as a hobby
It transferring money really such a big deal, don’t they/you all have IBAN/BIC
>All the cashmoney in my wallet after I return from holiday
Hard to earn money under the table if everything is electronic
/s ^^^^not ^^^^really
Yes, that's what I mean
So relative to the sun, you eat at a "normal" time, if you can call it that, but due to the time zone it's "late".
The only Austrians I know who go to Slovakia for shopping are Slovaks living in Austria :D
Because they don't sell this kind of "trash" in austria and it's interesting to try
but driving there solely for buying this stuff is a bit weird
I did it once after a trip to some city with friends and afterwards we hung out at my apartment and tried all the disgustingly sweet food with bad artificial flavourings
Felt horrible afterwards but it was fun :)
of course its the Viennese, who would have thought
i regularly go there by bike or car, have lunch and a walk
It is close enough for a day trip, and the best thing is, you dont have to deal with grumpy Viennese :D
Really
But you just punch in/copy&paste the digits in you online banking
It’s also about more secure I think
Holy faxmachine,  1980s Batman
What kind of hillbilly stuff it that, isn't France in the EU anymore
I looked through the comments and we use almost every single word down there too
Some don‘t even have german names by deafult, like, I recently googled what chapstick would be in german and the *dicitionary* said there‘s labello and labello only
We call tape "Tixo". In Germany it's called Tesafilm I think
Isn't duct tape just one specific type of tape
The silver one
Son in german panzer band or Industrieklebeband
Tesa is just sticky tape or the brand name scotch tape
Yeah but duct tape is only the big silver one as I understand
It was made during ww2 to the ammunition  dry, but the soldiers realized they could fix jeeps and everything with it
I always though duct tape is the large stuff
I may be wrong, but I don't think anyone refers to scotch tape as duct tape
I don't think panzerband is called tesa, or is it
No worries
I just couldn't resist
But I do hope the information comes in handy some day
In upper Austrian dialect "Pfrundsblodschn" means both kite and dragon
It can also refer to a gullible foreigner
But when spoken there is no chance of misunderstanding as the first meaning has its emphasis on UM the latter on FAHREN
Two Asian tourist groups started a fight in St
Peter's basilica in Rome in front of the Pieta because they were blocking each other while taking pictures
Do a Hitler salute
Probably, asking where the train station is while standing right before the main door
Less than 2m distance
&#x200B;
Other than that, as many people commented already, asians risking their life for photos
My favourite peeve is when they congregate on the end of an escalator
When I went to the US, someone told me that a friend of them went to Germany and thought it would be funny if he did the Hitler salute when getting off the plane
He proceeded to ask me if I find it weird too that he got arrested
Then they were surprised that I was not surprised at all by that story
"Right at the top of the hill"
"What hill
"The only hill you can see in the middle of Edinburgh
"What hill
"Dude
do you even have eyes
Where are you looking
"At that weird old house on the mountain

"What
"Nevermind

It's basically straw

Uh, could you elaborate
It's not a tourist thing

Doesn't sound too difficult though
Mashed potatoes are pretty firm
It's not like potato soup
Now you finally figured out why we queue for the loos, and always go in pairs or groups
In a recent episode of Rick & Morty, there is a quick line in the original english version that is in german
When watching it I only subconsciously thought "huh, that sounded weird for some reason" and it wasn't until I read reddit about the episode a while later that I realized it's in german
Understanding actually
They knew that was insensitive, but found the arrest over the top
Someone that was with me at that moment asked if that isn't against free speech and all, but - after a brief history lesson - both agreed why we take the Verbotsgesetz very seriously
Well tbh, when I'm abroad, I'd gotten used to saying that I was from Austria and, when I was met with strange looks, following that up with "the country south of Germany
Also, we'd been talking for a while, so the conversation went there quite naturally
I've been there in March

The bus rides weren't so good (I have motion sickness) but the city is beautiful (and the sea of course, and the landscape :D) There's an island at the sea connected to Edinburgh with a bridge (I guess)
I didn't have the chance to go there because it was chilly/stormy/rainy on that day and I didn't want to risk anything :`D
Yes
That's the name
Two friends and I slept at a hosting family house (hope I say it right xD) in Silverknowes street
So we hadn't much of a walk there
I guess "Restoesterreich" (residual Austria) would be one term
Hungary and Austria are quite similar in that regard that a huge percentage of people are living in the capitol (20+%) which is very uncommon afaik
Not really
I mean, there are a few words for rural areas or the middle of nowhere, Provinz, Pampas, Hinterland, Arsch der Welt etc
but it doesn't really apply to other cities or larger towns and definitely not to everything outside Vienna as a whole
"Provinz" in Austria
And yes, it is used in derogatory sense since the country is heavily centered around Vienna
If anything it's the other way around, everybody making fun of poor Berlin
At least these are the jokes I always hear from Germans
Isn´t it always the other way round in austria that all the other states are looking down on vienna and "die gschissenen Werner"? Even "Gscherte" in vienna isn\`t so much used for people from the countryside but more for viennese from the poorer city districts
Well, "Die Provinz" is a much more fitting term actually used by people in Vienna
It's mostly used to refer to lower Austria, but can also mean "anywhere in Austria except Vienna".
Someone coming from the countryside can be (derogatorily) referred to as "Gscherta" (person, who's head has been sheered)

Ganz schön peinlich
Aber ich mein ganz im Ernst, alle anderen hier bekommen es ja wohl hin, auf Englisch zu antworten
Welchen Mehrwert hat dein Beitrag denn für Leute die Griechisch nicht sprechen
Wenn ich Griechisch lesen wollen würde, würde ich ja wohl in einen griechischen Subreddit gehen
Dein Beitrag: unnecessary
Nein nein, ich finde nur die Ironie dahinter lustig
Warning: like all responses in this comment section, this post is full of stereotypes, generalizations, and subjective and biased observations
Don't take it all too seriously
Like most **Central Europeans**, **Austrians** often dress very blandly and cheap and not particularly stylish in general (exceptions exist of course)
Kinda stuck in the late 2000s. Either that or very conservatively, which is a safe bet, but a bit boring
Also, there's barely variations in occasions
Going out, hanging out at home, going to work; the same outfit is fine for all those things
The really "stylish" Austrians always end up looking like what Berliner hipsters looked like 3 years ago
In **Italy** in my excperience it's like this: either you see people dressed like Armani models, or dressed super trashy
There's overlaps, and there's a little room in between, but very little
But whichever it is, it's always lots of brands (fake or real), and there's *always* (even with the best outfit) that one little detail which makes the whole thing completely over the top
Often the shoes or the sunglasses
Italians are extreme tight-rope-walkers and it's really very fascinating
But I guess you can't be fashionable and innovative if you're not daring
Donatella Versace embodies this spirit of Italian clothing prefectly
The basics are relatively stylish and fancy, but then there's that touch that just pushes it over the top towards the brink of trashy
**Spanish** people generally dress well, but often they all look similar, because in the end everybody buys the same Inditex stuff
Guys very often wear long sleeved shirts, and women for some reason tend to have a faible for high-plateaued shoes [like this] or [this] No idea why
This trend has been going on for a few years already
When I see a woman with ridiculously high shoes in Vienna, chances are at around 70% she's Spanish
Also, Spanish people (also Italians) really dress up when they go out
Which is nice
**Basque** people in particular are a bit weird
Especially the borroka ones often look like they're about to climb a mountain
Even when they aren't about to do that
They seem to love expensive functional outdoor clothing from the holy 3: Mammut, Ternua, Patagonia
Either that, or it's everything stripes
Or T-shirts with political messages written in Basque (e.g. Altsasukoak aske)
And when Basque men have to be fancy, a chequered shirt is the solution
And don't get me even started on the hairstyles
**Brits** have some similarities with Italians
Either they're Alexa Chung, or completely off-the-charts trashy and chav
Whichever it is, you can see, they really like to make an impression
You personally don't like how you think all Germans dress
No need to be a bitch about it tbh
my tip would be: wear tighter-fitted pants and avoid certain types od shoes (wear either boots, leather shoes, or fashionable converse)
also you can't really go wrong with long-sleeve shirts
try to dress as what you feel to be "smart". and muted colors
I'd avoid sneakers, sweatpants, or baggy clothes; nothing with logos on it; nothing too casual; and nothing too colorful
good news is that accessorizing  is ok for guys and is kinda fun (nice scarf,  bag, etc)
I live 20 min away from the Italian border and the fact that in the north of Italy, more specific the region SouthTyrol,  the majority is German speaking it doesn't fell like beeing in a foreign country
I ll go there occasionally with my friends or family there just for eating a pizza or drinking a coffee  or to hang out there somewhere
There is a train going every hour to Italy so it is really easy to go there
With the ID i think it is mandatory to have it with you but in realty no one ever checked for it, so its not a big deal if you don't have it with you
In border cities
Very often, I'm sure
A friend of mine lives in Germany near the French border and she does a lot of her day to day grocery shopping in France
The Swiss go shopping into neighboring countries all the time because food is less expensive there
Living in Austria, I have relatives in Germany that I visit 2-3 times every year
I’ve also been to Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Vatican City and France (if Corsica counts)
Oh I'm waiting for that to open soooo much
I wanna buy a bed in a specific colour and a specific size
Not possible in Austria, so I'm hoping it will be available in Slovenia
Otherwise I will have to go to Zagreb or Munich
(Yes, I really want that bed
Border
Yes
Everything else
Absolutely not
I used to fly to the uk quite regularly, so was very much used to the passport controls within eu
Then I flew to Rome, walked out the airport and realised not once did I have to get out the passport
Super strange
I know
This can vary
I have been asked for my passport numerous times when crossing back to Austria from Slovenia
I read that as „Persians“ and was really confused what the connection between them and the Arc de Triomphe roundabout was
There are quite a few loanwords in my dialect that don't exist in standard German like "liesnen" meaning to listen
Handy means mobile phone in german
It's just the english word handy, yet in english it doesn't mean phone
So it's a loan word that means something entirely different
My favourite is one “șmecher”. It comes from German Schmecker/schmecken where it means taster/to taste
However, in Romanian it means a cunning/sly person
The story goes that centuries ago, Germans from Transylvania crossed the mountains south to Oltenia to sell their handcraft and buy quality wine
The locals played the good hosts, fed the Germans well and got them drunk with their strongest wine, which they weren’t quite used to
Only then did they start bargaining for the price of the crafts, while also selling the Germans a different, worse wine that the one they agreed upon tasting, without them noticing until they got back home
So next year they return, eat, drink and cheer again with the locals
Only this time the Germans choose a wise guy to stay sober this whole time and only step in when it came to discussing the price and choosing the wine, so that they don’t get fooled again
And so they presented him to the locals: “Das ist der Schmecker”.
So a “șmecher” became a person who is hard to fool
The word evolved further in Romanian, so now you also have it as an adjective = cool, șmecherie=trick/guile/cool thing, a șmecheri - to fool someone, etc
Cearșaf, ciorapi and cișmea made their way into Romanian as well
We also use “musai” with the same meaning in Romanian
I was mindblown when I found out where it comes from a while ago when learning German
Definitely Slovenian, there are a lot of folks who speak Slovenian in Carinthia but not due to recent migration, the so called "Carinthian Slovenians" ("Kärntner Slowenen" in German) are often indistinguishable from other Austrians, since they speak accent-free German like the typical Austrian, (some have a Slavic-like surname but that is all) but they speak Slovenian among them in order to maintain the cultural heritage
Alas, in the Nazi-era, these people were harassed and speaking Slovenian was forbidden
I honestly don‘t know
I‘d say my first guess is slovenian, because of Cyrinthia
(I think at the border they often speak slovenian and sometimes get taught that in school
Or maybe hungarian
I‘m really not sure tho
If you would split Serbo-Croatian in Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian, Turkish would be the on the top
And if we are talking high school level, it's probably French or something ;)
Yes I know, it is like the difference in Austrian German and Norm high German, basically it is the same language, some people may feel offended if you tell them they speak Serbo-Croatian
In the neue mittelschule (Age 10-14) you get thought things like typing, navigating on pc, saving/opening files, basic word/excel/powerpoint , send/read emails and things like that
My old school recently added some big things to what they teach like more advanced excel and even scratch (programmimg language developed to teach young people)
I would say that is early enough for teaching them things like that
You don't really need it for anything befor that
It's a catastrophe here ... Teacher are clueless and the government things the solution are tablet classes ...
I'm so angry
I recently watched a documentary on ARTE, and they showed how teachers in Spain do simple exercises in robotics using Arduino boards with  grade-schoolers while here people think it helps kids to buy an IPhone and how to buy the apps on some app-store in contrast to learn real computer skills ...
At least you have the ability to learn, not everyone does

Yeah it is rather popular with young people in my neck of the woods
It's probably less common in more rural/conservative parts of the country though
Over the whole population, not too popular
Most are indifferent, I feel
Wow, I've never seen someone from French Polynesia around
How is life there apart from the weed
What is life like in french polynesia
Ive never heard about it until now, but after reading a bit about it i'm intrigued to hear some stories, if you dont mind :)
I'm from a rather rural area and I can tell you that many young people smoke weed occasionally
It's mostly the older people (like 40+) who are still very conservative
Edit: rural area in Upper Austria
Oh I'm sure about that, you guys smoke a ton of weed to come down from all of the Crystal you use over there :p
Thank you so much, that's way more in depth than I expected
I never knew that French Polynesia is such a large and diverse place
What would really interest me too is, do you consider yourself French at all or does the average person
And would you like to become an independent nation one day
I feel like it would be one of the larger and more imports nations of Oceania and could quite easily survive and thrive on its own
Is Upper Austria known for Crystal or was that just a joke
Lol
I'm not really into weed or drugs so I don't know anything haha
Yeah it's definitely the closest thing to a memetical Crystal place in Austria
At least the border regions to Czechia
Lol true actually
As far as I can tell the more you go north the more drugs they have haha

Welcome to onomatology
put all these stuff away
> forgetting to use articles
Slavic and Turkish speakers do the same thing in German, they tend to omit articles and sometimes even prepositions
Apparently this happens because they don't have those features (well at least articles, they must have some form prepositions I suppose, but IDK) in their languages, so they have a harder time getting a feeling for the appropriate use
A famous example for how Viennese German dialect/slang has been changing over the recent decades (due to the influence of immigrants from Slavic countries and Turkey) is "Gehen wir zum BILLA" (Let's go to the supermarket) turning into "Gehen wir BILLA" (Let us go supermarket)
The fun thing about this is that the basic meaning of the sentence remains, and the informative value is still clear as day
The (dative) article is actually really unnecessary here, so is the preposition, because obviously we are going TO the supermarket, where else would we go; definitely not under it
This phenomenon is still quite prevalent among 2nd and 3rd generation immigrant children, so prevalent actually, that many "autochthonous" people (i.e. at least several generations of German speakers), especially in urban areas, have started using it in colloquial speech as well (I catch myself doing it sometimes, it's just shorter)
A friend of mine, who is a lower secondary grade teacher, once told me an interesting anecdote about a conversation between to ~12 year old students of her that went something like this:
A: "He, gib mir Lineal
" ("Hey, hand me ruler")
B: "Bist du deppert oder was
Das heißt 'Gib mir Lineal bitte
'" ("Are you stupid or what
That's 'Hand me ruler please
'")
While speaker B realized that something was "wrong" about speaker A's sentence, he didn't notice the grammatical inaccuracy, because the semantic meaning of the sentence was clear (btw: the grammatically "correct" way would be "Gib mir *das* Lineal" - "Hand me *the* ruler")
Rather he pointed out the pragmatic inaccuracy, namely that he was missing the "please" as a sign of politeness/respect (which is a very Austrian thing to do)
Coming back to the topic at hand, you can spot *the* native German speakers, but also some *the* Romance-language speakers, by the exact opposite thing, namely *the* overusage of *the* articles, and using *the* articles in places they're not necessary
left Slovakia for Austria couple of years ago because well eastern europe :P it's 270km from Vienna to my hometown so i can still visit my family pretty often
Cool, how do you like it here
What do you think about the culture & people
Ooh I hope you‘ll be happy here, or at least happier than you were before
My mom left Poland about 23 years ago too, because she needed a job
I think if you can speak a lil bit german or maybe learn the dialect of the region you‘re going to, you‘ll be fine here
Much luck to you, hope everything works out
(Especially now with our uncertain future)
Well Eisenbahn is more like "iron path", not "road". But still similar
Iron path sounds like right from a 70's Hongkong Kung-Fu Flick
Iron Path
Works too, yeah
If you go off road, the alps, but ither than that you'll topically see a smaller farming village every few minutes
Parts of the Alps and a few smaller national parks
Otherwise no, we suffer from a very cluttered population, which destroys the natural beauty of the country
In some places, it looks like someone has emptied a giant garbage bag over the hills
Not really untouched but there are some places where you will not see a dingle human for miles
My gf's almost 90 year old great uncle lives almost like hermit, in the Pyrenees
He lives in the outskirts of a midsized village 30 minutes from Donostia, deep in the forest, on a mountain, deep in a national park
He doesn't speak any Spanish, although he understands it a little bit
When I visited, my gf had to translate everything I said
But he understood my question about the number of his sheep, "drenta-tzinko" he responded
He's unable to form a whole sentence in Spanish though
He speaks an old dialect of Gipuzkoan Basque that almost nobody else speaks anymore, like a living fossil
During the dictatorship he used to smuggle stuff from France to Spain for a living, since he lives very close to the two countries' official border
He once told us, how his first job was smuggling a huge backpack full of condoms, because condoms (as well as abortions) were illegal under Franco
But he also smuggled other things that were legal but hard to get, like nylon tights, or random stuff, like alarmclocks
Imagine smuggling a whole bunch of old-timey alarm clocks through a forest in the dead of night, with the Guardia Civil looking for you
I'd be afraid that one of them goes off all of the sudden
Anyway
that guy does not believe in God or the Afterlife, even though his 300 years old house is full of Marias and crucifixes
He says "If there's a life after death, then where the hell is everybody
" He does not believe that the world is 2/3rds ocean, he thinks it is impossible, even if his own brother went fishing all the way to Greenland back in the day, and told him about the vastness of the ocean
He also does not believe that a man has been to the moon, because that's impossible
He never got married, because he doesn't trust anybody enough
I don't think he's ever been to Donostia
I assume he has seen the sea (he lives literally 15 car minutes from the coast), but I wouldn't even be surprised if he hasn't. With his almost 90 years he still has over 30 sheep that he looks after and he leads them onto their pastures high in the mountains
He has a microwave, he got it as a present once, but he has never used it, and uses it as storage room for plates and stuff instead
The only heating in his house is his tradtional old school open fire place
He has two stoves, an old iron one that works with fire, and a new electric one
Guess which one he almost never uses
Now that he's so old, once a week my gf's dad has to bring him groceries from the village, so he doesn't have to go down
There is a road going to that house, however that road is less than 15 or 20 years old, and if you don't know exactly which turns you have to take you'd never find the place
I know I wouldn't. He also has been smoking like a chimney ever since he was 14 years old, but he's still exceptionally fit for his age
He's too stubborn to quit, and he's too stubborn to get cancer
Recently he's made a list of 15 people he knows that according to him should to die already, because they do not serve any purpose anymore in this world
Three of those people had already died in the last two years, and he put himself on that list as well
His family has been telling him in recent years that he's been getting too old to live all the way there on the mountain, all alone, but he's too stubborn, and says, he was born in that house, has spent all his live in that house, and he will die in that house
He is the personification [of this Basque poem] He is probably the most Basque man I have ever met
Had to google that island, I always love geographical curiosities like that
Pretty much all of it are man-made environments too though
You won't find miles of untouched nature in Austria
You can find a lot of untouched land
North and South America have huge untouched parts
Same goes for Africa, Australia and Asia
Just not in most of Europe
Thanks for the info, u/Big_Dirty_Piss_Boner
>How do you feel about the return of the wolf
The wolf has no place in Germany and Austria
Trying to force wolves to repopulate the area is dumb, because they'll never be able to live a natural life in our man-made environment
The ecosystems we created over the centuries in Europe have no place for wolves
There is no point in trying to bring them back
I see what you did there and I approve of it
Fun fact: We had several head of states born in places which were part of Austria-Hungary the time they were born but weren't part of the Republic when they became head of the state (e.g. Karl Renner)
I'm not sure how it's going to be today, we had a minor controversity because the minister of Justice was born in former Yugoslavia and fled with her parents to Austria, but it was really minor
As the president is elected directly at least half of the people should be ok with that
Really depends
If they were born in European countries of similar cultures it wouldn't cause much fuss I think
Generally the more different the culture the more controversial
To be exact it was 3
Karl Renner was born 1870 in Untertannowitz (Dolní Dunajovice) in southern Moravia, then part of Austria-Hungary
His successor Theodor Körner was born 1873 in Újszőny bei Komorn (now part of Komárom) in Hungary, then Austria-Hungary
His successor Adolf Schärf was born in 1890 in Nikolsburg (Mikulov) in southern Moravia again
All the others were from today's Austria:
Franz Jonas 1899, Floridsdorf, then Lower Austria, now Vienna
Rudolf Kirchschläger 1915, Niederkappel in Upper Austria
Kurt Waldheim 1918, St
Andrä vor dem Hagenthale in Lower Austria
Thomas Klestil 1932, Vienna
Heinz Fischer 1938, Graz
Alexander van der Bellen 1944, Vienna
All the 1st Republic Presidents (Seitz, Hainisch, Miklas) were born in Lower Austria (Seitz was born in Vienna, which was still part of Lower Austria)
> a minor controversity because the minister of Justice was born in former Yugoslavia
The only ones really complaining were the ones who like to complain about every fart that comes out of any non-Austrian ass
I.e. the Freedom Party
Alma Zadic got legit threats over this, that's the scary part
Well, our last two friendships didn't work out that great for everyone else, so we decided that to be alone for now
Uhm

Kann man fragen warum du dich als Liechtensteiner ausgibts
Probably because the family of Liechtenstein has quite some claims on Czech lands
Not really, even right now Germans are patrolling the border to Austria because of "the refugee crisis".

Aufm Austria sub is er mit Vorarlberg betitelt

Abgesehen davon, dass es keinen Sinn machen würde als nicht Liechtensteiner dort zu leben
An und für sich ist das ja alles egal, dennoch frage ich mich warum er r/Askeurope hinters Licht führen will

Yeah, tons of middle aged guys wear those cringy [Camp David] shirts
That's almost all shirts from run-of-the-mill stores like H&M. Most have something to do with sports, California, surfing, or boats
And some random year dates
Guess the designers figure "surfing on the beaches of California is something unoffensive all potential customers can agree on
I don't get why, but a lot of people wear them
H&M and all the other stores have them aplenty in their stores
If anybody who likes them reads this: Why
Yeah, I have some of them too and honestly I've got no idea what the text means
Its a comic, but its pretty much true
These shirts are literally made with randomizers
Yeah, those are the ones I most commonly see too
"Daytona Beach" with a load of random English words also seems common to me
That's because Camp David is an actual brand sold at Peek & Cloppenburg
Which tells you why it's all middle aged guys haha
> Why
Copied from above: It's because it makes as much sense as other shirts with English words on them, like "University of New York" or "Surfing Championship '85". Any significance in meaning that might have existed over the pond is gone; over here, it's always just words so the shirt doesn't look empty
Once you accept that, it makes a lot of sense, because nobody fucking cares what's on the shirt, as long as the font looks nice
It's so that the shirt is not "just blue", but "blue with some orange details on it" instead
>middle aged men from central/eastern Europe
So basically middle aged Austrians ;)
Supply and demand
So its literally just visual noice
Welp, at least it explains it
We Austrians are Frivans though
Nothing against a pattern or whatever
I just think that nonsense words are an odd choice for a visual
Thanks for the startup idea
I mean we *do have* some of the best tap water in the world
As an Austrian, I wouldn´t know how to define it
Not as far as dry as the German humor, not as witty as British humor
We do enjoy some dirty jokes, but I wouldn´t know if there was any typical Austrian humor
Well, we like to joke about Germans
But that is pure compassion, so that they are least somehow funny
No selfdeprication and if it is in a very anti hero mode
All deflection
And dark, dirty, gross af so everybody backs off
Edit: the goal is to be the most unsympathetic character you can be if you want to be "the funny guy" in Austria
What have black humour and a black guy in common
Both are unwanted
^ that describes it pretty well
Aka the darker your humour is, the better it comes off
Oe just discrimlnatory over all
Me, a closted pansexual, always feels weird when people make jokes about gay people, sometimes even people who _know_ I‘m pansexual and accept it
German humor is no laughing matter
I would add "very sarcastic", especially the typical Viennese sense of humour
If I had to sum it up in one word:
morbid
In media it's generally fairly dark and absurd but played straight
Pythonesquely absurd while focusing not on the absurd but making it seem believable
at least in my media bubble
Obviously this changes, there's everything from light hearted humour to offensive, self depricating stuff
A lot of productions that are comedic or at least have a comedic side are so precisely because of a lack of focus on the comedy
Imagine smth like The Life of Brian if it were presented as a serious drama
Examples of comedy coming from absurd/ dark stuff played straight:
The Brenner films (2000-?)
Fink fährt ab (1999 film)
Aufschneider (2010 tv film)
Braunschlag (2012 tv show)
Toni Erdmann (2016 film)
Drei Eier im Glas (2015 film) and Contact High (2009 film) sort of fit as well although these ones definitely focuses on the absurd much more
Sorry for the wall of text
Italian tales of heroism
Delicious english food
Yes
Jokes about death are always a burner
Id add Muttertag - Mothers day as a classic early 90ties example
Defined punchlines in youth culture in Vienna for years
Wouldn´t the more German answer be: "Why the hell do you knock at this time of the day
MITTAGSRUHE, VERDAMMT NOCHMAL
I will call the police if you knock again
Not really a breakdown but Covid coincided withebthe start of our new conservative/green coalition government
The head of the Green party, Vice Chancelor and upon other things responsible for sport got on a minute long rant about sport clubs not adhering to the covid rules, threatening to remember any who defied him to cut their subsidies next year
It was really funny moment as he had portraid himself as a laid back bohemian up until then
He went full authoritarian on youth sports, trying to outdo his new coalition partner on strict measures
In Romania as well
There were multiple different ocassions, but i remembered about this one
There are 2 senators or deputies one in opposition and one from the ruling party and they are argue about what they did or did not do
Then there are some insults regarding one of the names that sounds similar to "Bidet" (Bideu in romanian - the place neart the toilet where you wash your ass
Then this happens:
Danes seem to have a remarkably bad streak of luck in military matters since the end of the Kalmar Union
How harsh could that sentence be for someone to literally hang themselves
Dude is nuts
How radical-right faux-pas in our right-wing party FPÖ are just one "isolated case" after the other
That we were the first victim of Nazi Germany
Although it's more of a narrative than a running joke
Elaborate
And the democratically elected president for all eternity
Same here, it's probably to give parents a bit of time to prepare, not everyone has a nanny waiting at home
I personally find it funny that the last coalition entailed two parties which both created fascist states in Austria independantly from each other
And that no member of the ÖVP got any flak for their fascist experiment back in their CS days in 34
Not to speak of the proto FPÖ members going all scotfree
I bet [this guy] disagrees
Which worldmap
We are allready closing down schools
Latest on wednesday everything has to be closed
They are even talking about banning all travel in/out of the most infected areas (mostly vienna, graz and innsbruck)
I love your language but everytime I see a polish text I have the urge to send you a gift basket with some more vowels
> It didn't happen/ they deserved it
Schrödinger's Turk
They're sound, when you think about it
Well, not really
High schools are closed
Primary and middle schools will still be open, just not in class
Parents can keep their children at home and look after them, or they can send them to school to be watched there
They won't be learning anything new there
Ah okay
My gf is from Gipuzkoa, and she always says how Bilbainos are all unos flipados and how they are super fixated on Bilbao
I don't know where you get this
My mother is teaching in middle school and they will close down completly
The only thing they do is to give then working material for the next weeks and then the school is closed for everyone
I got this from the official communique by the government
Since primary and middle schools aren't managed federally, they can have other measures put in place
But there isn't a countrywide closedown
I mostly follow politics in other countries when our news outlets report on them so that's mostly the big countries (Germany, France, Italy, UK) or where things aren't going to well (Hungary, Poland, etc
may I ask why you follow Austrian politics in particular
and what your take on it is
I‘m more interested in EU politics than in Austrian politics because I have honestly no clue what the fuck is going on in my country and what all of the politicians are even doing
It‘s like everything is in dutch or smth: I feel like I need to understand it and if I try really hard I can understand the context but overall I have no clue what‘s going on
>  Austrian because it is comedic in a fun way
Sounds about right
It's sad if it actually affects you though
Yeah, the Socialdemocrats did a good job in Vienna
And good luck on moving here (whenever that‘ll be) :)
Actually it all started with Haider, the OG Strache
Ok now you've got me hooked, I will follow czech politics from here on out
Vienna
People there ask for cigarettes, without saying "Bitte".
Wait what makes it scary
The stories
But otherwise its just a hill, or a small mountain, right
Still better than huge ass-spiders
Before Jimmy Page bought it, it was owned by Aleister Crowley
He is said to have some of his demonic rites there
To add to all that, the house sits on the shores of Loch Ness
I recently listened to a podcast about Andrées expedition to the north pole with a hot air balloon, that ended in an usolved mystery in north eastern svalbard
so yep, that fits
EVERYONE does it
I know people my age who drink so much every weekend that they pass out or have a blackout, there are no real consequences and alcohol is also easily accessible
It was only changed last year, until then every kind of alcohol was legal at age 16 in Lower Austria, Burgenland and Vienna
I think now it is the same in all states
It's not exactly a buying age
It's forbidden to "make alcohol available" to kids under the age
That includes buying/selling, but also gifting it
I don't know any parent that would let their 10 or even 12 year old have more than a few sips of alcohol
I think most will start drinking at 15 or 16
Liaben Gruaß aus Öberösterreich an den Nachbarn
In Austria, it's an "Ausschankverbot". Basically, adults are not allowed to give alcohol to people under the drinking age
They may not sell it to them neither gift it
Don't think so, under normal circumstances
We have five main parties:
ÖVP: The Austrian People's Party
Socially conservative and economically liberal
They also are the traditional voice of farmers and rural voters
It's the party of Chancellor Kurz
(last election: 37,5%, 71/183 seats)
SPÖ: The Social Democrats: Socially liberal and center-left economically
They are rather split on migration though
Half of the party take a progressive stance, the other half are more restrictive about it
(last election: 21,2%, 40/183)
FPÖ: our far-right, populist, anti-EU, anti-climate-action, anti-migration party
They have always been a cesspool of corruption and they fail to distance themselves from right-wing-extremist groups
They also have close ties to Putin's United Russia party
(last election: 16,2%, 31/183 seats, they kicked out one of their MPs at the start of the term
That MP is the wife of Mr
Ibiza, HC Strache
The Green Party: They are a center-left, progressive party with a focus on environmentalism
They are the junior coalition partner in government
(last election: 13,9%, 26/183 seats)
NEOS: They are a liberal center party
They and the Greens are the most pro-European parties in our political system
Their core issues are also transparency and anti-corruption
(Last election: 8,1%, 15/183 seats)
Our government is a turquoise-green coalition (ÖVP + Green Party)
They have a lot of differences but they still work rather well together
I'm glad that they are the ones managing the Corona crisis and not the previous ÖVP+FPÖ government
This coalition is, in my opinion, a good compromise between the conservative majority in the country and the more progressive parts of society
A list of all major parties from right to left:
FPÖ: "Liberal party austria" far right coservative party
ÖVP: "austrian peoples party" center right conservative party
SPÖ: "socialist party austria" center left party
Die grünen: "green party" left enviromental party
Neos: left liberal party
Bierpartei: "beer party" wants free beer for everyone and to stop people from working
I see you avoided the part where Sin Fein is elected (in Northern Ireland) but does not take their seats
To add to the confusion of the presidential role, let me mention that there is a chancellor of Switzerland
But it is not to be compared to the German one
They are just the head of some part of the federal administration, and while present at meetings of the federal council they have no vote
Yeah
I understood that
But I also felt that in the theme of OP's question, where they mention parties on the ballot vs in parliament, I thought it was an interesting point: being elected doesn't always mean sitting in parliament
My gym membership
Haven't been there since the birth of my daughter 3 years ago, but cancelling it *now* during Covid would feel mean
Thankfully it's dirt cheap
I also made a generous donation to Wikipedia because the last thing we need is them partnering with corporate or political sponsors
A few years ago I bought lots of *Schwedenbomben* sweets when the company was going bankrupt
I love the stuff, but OMG, the sugar
I have never heard of anyone who ordered pasta
Doesn't make any sense to me
Lots
Most are untranslatable
"Meinetwegen" is probably the most formal
Another option would be "wenn es sein muss" ("if it has to be so")
In local dialect we'd say "na wennst meinst", "von mir aus" or "wenn du des sagst". Those are more passive aggressive though
"Is a schen woam
" - "that's nice and warm too
" (A rather regional expression i guess)
"Passt scho
" - "that fits too
" (a *very* loose translation
i guess it's actually more along the lines of "whatever")
"Na dann
" - "well then"
"Scho recht
" s'ma wuarscht"
Waunst maanst
Eh woah
Jo eh
Scho, oba
In dialect, I'd just say "jo, eh" or even just "eh"
I also think that "Passt scho" is the most fitting phrase here
At least in Austria
German has naja, which Austrians pronounce as na jo
It means no but yes, essentially, is that the same for you
"fair enough" can have that passive-aggressive undertone as well
exactly the same here
exactly the same here
wow
very old-fashioned
Italy is a very very old-fashioned country
I come from an established, high middle-class Viennese family
There's a good chance I would have gone into administration or the army (and probably died in the Napoleonic Wars)
I would be a farmer in the Banat
My family descends from Danubian Swabians which were settled in the region by Maria Theresia
I'd probably be some rural bureaucrat, given my families background
Or if I go down the other side of the family, a farmer
I'd be a farmer
I grew up on a farm, so that's quite obvious
But since I'm now 20 I probably would've married  the son of an other farmer five years ago and would be pregnant with my third child
Dead too
And given all the other answers hre, it's visible well why people liked to have >10 kids
Increases the chance that 1-2 actually become adults
You would more likely be married off somewhere in the 22-27 range depending if your potential husband was able to establish his household
Late marriage was more or less considered family planning
Additionally if you weren‘t middle class, meaning your family didn’t have a lot of land or were merchants you wouldn‘t be married off for gain
There was no point
So you potentially have the option of marrying for love
I would too, and would most likely be called johann
Since my grandfather was a farmer called johann, his father was a farmer called johann, his father was a farmer called johann, ... that goes back 7 generations or so, and the head of my family moved not more then 50 km from the area we lived back then
And that move was only about 100 years ago
Glasses are a few hundred years older than you apparently think
>oh and having to listen to my patriotic dad bitching about getting poland back
Not much has changed, huh
How bourgeois
Depends how old you are
Marriage usually only happened when you were 27+ and could support your own household with a partner
So maybe you dont have to be constantly pregant before 27 ^^
>With the caveat that you'd probably have needed to have your future spouse be ok'ed by your parents
That was the norm back then
Makes sense too as families were much more of an economic unit back then
>But unless you have absolutely terrible taste in women/men, like falling in love with a Catholic girl, that usually wasn't a problem
Heretics can always reconvert
>By the way, early marriage, as in late teens and early twenties, did happen quite a bit, but generally only in the case of an unplanned pregnancy
Yeah, that too and not just in Calvinist Holland
There is the saying that the first child takes variable time while the second one always takes nine months
The standard of living was way better in the Middle ages, especially after the Black Death, when compared to the industrial revolution
Wages were way better and the peasants had more land available
Seems to be a theme in Catholic countries
Have some fun but be prepared to take responsibility
Additionally the child is not a bastard as long as it is born after the wedding
*taps forehead*
We shouldn't extend our dependence on the CCP any longer
Move vital industries back to Europe and recognize the RoC
We have the "Christkind" (basically baby Jesus) instead of Santa Claus
Saint Nikolaus traditionally "visits" on 6th December
He lived in Turkey in the 4th century
Is baby jesus a blonde girl angel in Slovakia like he is in Austria
There's a reason it's Baby Jesus
No holes yet, just an angelic smile and blonde locks
You get "real" gifts for Nikolaus
My kid gets tangerines, nuts, and chocolate
It's an angelic looking toddler actually
Often looks like a girl, but it's supposed to be kind of genderless
Not jesus christ, just baby jesus who brings the presents
Oh, they don't come down the chimney, they are described as kind of flying around outside and dropping things off under the christmas tree on christmas eve, through the window I guess
Awww :)
But I still fill my kid's Adventkalender each day, so there's that ;)
Oh no, the picture is just comparing Father Christmas to the Christkind, it's usually either or, never both together
A better translation would be the christ child, but baby jesus sounds cuter/more absurd
Hahaha, wait till you hear about St
Nikolaus and his sidekick, the evil Krampus
Sometimes :P Not always
But it's always our fault
I was working as a ski instructor and once a German tourist asked me if we wear normal clothes as well in our freetime
I asked him what he meant and he said he thought that we always wear our local costume which looks like [this ]
Edit: If anyone’s wondering the region is the Zillertal
The costumes only look like that inside the valley
Otoh we do wear a lot of Tracht and Loden - Trachtenmode has even made a huge comeback over the last years
> That Leprechauns are like Irish pygmies IE a seperate ethnicity to other Irish people
That is kind of a hilarious thought though
Now I'm sad that this isn't true
> that we have no cities
I mean
Dublin is more like a long-stretched village than a city :P
But less comfy, and much much more expensive, and harder to fix
There are some places where Sunday is the day everyone wears it
My region however is not like this
Sadly
Of course it has
But this guy thought those clothes are all we have
I think certain groups of the Roma people do that in the Balkans (certainly not all Roma)
I think I saw something about that on Vice once
Chippies will generally fry about anything you bring to them as far as I know
I doubt anyone will be able to beat Paris Airport who [had to shut down due to their Windows 3

While not really beeing about technlogy, a citiy level politician of the right wing-party FPÖ was interviewed about climate change
She referred to CO2 emissions to beeing as high as "38 Gigabytes per year".
And she didn't misspeak either, she kept talking about gigabytes of CO2, presumeably instead of gigatones
Vienna wanted to switch the administration to Linux, even developed there own distro [Wienux] for this purpose
It was in the middle of the migration when it officially given up because a software used in the Kindergartens did not run on the distro and then all PCs already ran on it were replaced with new PCs wits Windows Vista for 125
000€
Oh I got another one, worked for a company in the defence industry as a software development intern (must have been in 2010 or so)
The actual development machines were airgapped
USB sticks were of course strictly forbidden but of course everyone used them because you have to transfer libraries and updates _somehow_. Would have been fun to dump a few infected sticks in the parking lot
Machines were running XP of course (not even sure if they had the latest SP installed, but doubt it)
For the single machine in the lab that actually was allowed an internet connection (and of course strictly forbidden to code on) mandated the use of Windows XP and IE 6 with the argument that their firewall is responsible for blocking all the evil things anyhow
I did not try to prove them wrong but I doubt it would have been too hard
In Austria there is a law allowing you to make copies for example of music CDs for your personal usage, e.g. a safety copy
Some years ago they decided that in order for the law applying to you you have to pay a fee (this is the most fucked up legal thing ever, you shouldn't need to pay a fee for a law to work)
So pay the fee, be allowed to make such copies
Now a reasonable person would say if I buy a music CD I pay a bit more and that is to cover that
But those idiots decided that you don't have to pay when buying the music, or the book or whatever, you have to pay when buying (empty) storage
They did a study and came up with a ridiculous number of files that are apparently saved on every storage so now you have to pay some extra euros when buying empty CDs, SD cards, PCs with internal hard drives, hard drives, a smart watch,... and that money goes to artists without them providing anything to the people who pay that stupid fee
Now obviously there is usage of storage where you don't store any of such copies
So you can, if you convince them that you aren't using it for that, get your money back
But those assholes admitted that if you apply for it as a citizen and not a company they will automatically reject it
It's sad but that's reality
I'd love to see either everything completely up-to-date or even that fever dream of running only FOSS in public institutions but in so many cases it's just not very realistic
tbf shes also a city-renowned alcoholic
I don't think windows update was a thing until XP

You got it
I don"t sell swimming pools but my landlord keeps sending me pages files (I'm on windows) and corrupted PDFs
When I send pdfs back they claimed several times that they cannot open it
Sending the same files again apparently fixed it
The word "doch". It can be used in a various of different contexts and is amplifying the speakers point
It is one of the most defiant words I know and is often used by fighting kids
Some examples:
This is my game
- I played with it first
- Give it back
- No
- Doch
Das ist doch Susan
- It's Susan
(in a surprised way)
Du bist doch schon gegangen
- I thought you already left
Also doch
- (I suspected something and it's now proven)
Ich bin doch noch hier
- I am still here (and changed my mind about leaving)
"Doch" in English
Would make my everyday life much easier
„sich ausgehen“ as in „etw
geht sich (nicht) aus“
This is only used in Austria as far as I know, not Germany
It comes in quite handy in everyday conversations
On the one hand, it can mean that there is (not) enough time, but it can also mean there is (not) enough space, or something doesn’t fit
Say the elevator is full for example, you can say „Das geht sich nicht mehr aus, I’ll take the stairs
“ or „my suitcase is not as full as yours, bei mir geht sich noch was aus
More often, it is used in the sense that there is or isn’t enough time to do something
Ex: „The store closes at 6pm, das geht sich jetzt nicht mehr aus“ or „das geht sich noch aus“.
There is a third meaning that is implied as well
When someone treats you poorly, for example in a relationship, you can say „es geht sich nicht aus“ emotionally
„I put in so much effort and get nothing in return
Das geht sich einfach nicht aus
“ (this might be a Viennese thing, I don’t know about other regions)
as a Viennese I gotta say „Oida“! It‘s basically Viennese in a nutshell and is exclusive to Vienna and maybe the sorrounding areas
It‘s derived from „Alter“ which means roughly „dude“.
Now, the beauty of it is that we use it in many contexts and only this one word is suffice to convene so many different layers/emotions, only depending on how you say it
[There is also a video about it, and the person who made it can currently be seen in a campaign against covid, produced by the city
Tja

helped me a lot when learning Japanese, and equating some of their own modifier words with ours
English natives struggled, but for the German-speakers it was just a simple matter of "ah, so 'no desu' is just like asking a question with 'denn' vs
without (Wohin gehst du/Wohin gehst du denn), perfectly clear".
Übersichtlich can be used in so many ways too
From "your storage organization is very neat and easy to understand" to ironically using it like "Die Auswahl in dem Geschäft war doch eher übersichtlich" - "the assortment in that store was rather small".
I nominate Vormittag
Same situation, existed as forenoon, not common anymore though
I always trip up when I want to talk about the time between maybe 9-10 and 12 in a work setting, no it's not morning anymore dammit, it's already Vormittag
I also love regional eccentricities like *epa* and *sochn*, which i have no translation for whatsoever
I think that's one of the reasons my language when speaking English is littered with modifiers like "pretty", "quite", "rather", "fairly", "more" etc
which are rather frowned upon in "good writing" circles
You do however have a word for the solution to Wackelkontakt, which i envy you for: percussive maintenance
I nominate Kreislaufproblem
Health problem with your circulation, that can mean blood pressure, blood sugar, slight fever, or any other ailment really
So simple
I find that 'to indulge in sth' comes pretty close
Well I wouldn't. Maybe it's a regional thing
Now that you mention it, we have kinda the same problem with ärgern in German
Sure, *irritate* works, but that's pretty close to the word "irritieren", which has another meaning alltogether
Probably because most people still grew up with some post WW2 anti-german propaganda (which was justified back in the 1940s, but come on
Also, especially in Hollywood movies, villains tend to still mostly be German/Russian/British, so that stereotype is still around
[r/Austria insider]
The Flak towers of Vienna are the most ugly buildings, but they were never build to be beautiful
nah, Flak towers are awesome in a brutalist kind of way
especially in Vienna's conservative cityscape, they are so bold that it's really exciting
The Dancing House is cool
Gotta visit it next time I'm in Prague
Honestly I only find the TH Nürnburg ugly from those
And the church but it's really cool inside
Who is doing that
The FLNC
It looks like a cache pot for 15€ in IKEA
Well, at least they are not ugly and made of wood
[We've got a similar tower]
It's just the colour, reimagine it it would have a red brick front and then it's good
Fronte National Liberation Corse (don't know about the spelling, but you get the idea)
A separatist extremist organization
Kinda like IRA or ETA, but Corsican
Fyi, Spain is about the size of Texas and there's beautiful places everywhere, and you can do anything from a beach holiday, over hiking, cultural city trips, or even skiing in winter (a little bit at least)
Also, the climate between the sunny Mediterranean Coast, the dry semi-arid interior, and the lush, rainy and mountainous North varies greatly
So plan your trip well, and have fun
Yes, we have a contract with the holy see that guarantees it
Yes, it's an law from 1949 that a child of one of the official acknowledged religion has the right to get teached of their religion in school
The reason of this law was afaik a Concordat with the Catholic church which grands them to teach children the religion in school
Yes, we've religion as a subject in every year
It's specifically Catholic religion too
If you're not Catholic you don't have to be there
However, even as an atheist(not on paper though) I have had mostly good experience with those lessons because I've always had good teachers
They invited people from other regions to talk about theirs, they told us about our religions history etc
It wasn't mindless bible reading or singing religious songs or anything like that
Yes and there is a separate one for each religious group
So you have catholic, calvinist, lutheran as well as jewish, sunni, alavit gettimg their own teachers
Reason is a concordat treaty between the Vatican and Austria that grants the catholic chur h the privilege to teach at public schools
And because all religions are treated equal, this right is also grantef to all other recognized religions as well
interesting, this is *exactly* how it is here, down to all your points of criticism
me personally I had some great religion classes (like a homeroom class, doing stuff to build a harmonious class community) and some not so great ones (teacher came in and put a TV there and turned on a movie, often didn't show up at all), it really depended on the teacher
any kind fo reform so far failed because of an overwhelming feeling of "but that's how we've always done it".
Sounds a lot like the situation in Austria, except that it's 2 hours per week and any students, not just Catholics, are entitled to lessons in their own religions
You can opt out of course
Tell him we are all nudists
So i gave it a thought and my best idea is this: Tell him that Europeans are really freaked out by Americans because they tend to look Europeans waaay longer into their eyes than theyre used to do it and he should be really careful about this not to put people off, because it comes across as rather aggressive here
Tell him in Germany you have to clap 3 times when you fart
Say it has something to do with the gas attacks in WW1
Tell him the Dutch are big fans of Trump, really big fans
It's true
That's the reason why the national color is the color of Trumps skin
America first, but Netherland second
Tell him that toilets in Germany are not separated by gender
Tell him germans like to hear compliments about politicians
The current greatest revolutionist is Martin Sonneborn
If you wants to break ice with germans, praise Sonneborn
Actually he is more like a comedian, who is voted in the EU Parlament and doing funny stuff
Not gonna lie, that's kinda genius
The second one is great
Americans are stereotypically portrayed to be terribly scared of nudity
You're allowed to wear Speedos in Finland
I mean, I guess with the freezing cold and all that, but I can't imagine wearing that much clothes around here
This is actually also impolite in Austria
No, not at all :)
You are supposed to make eye contact while you are saying "Cheers" (or whatever)
Ah, okay, thats pretty weird - youre right
Most Likely [Dornbirn]
It's hard to choose if you have 1 city and else only villages of various sizes
So we would probably just annex czechia or bavaria and use prag/munich instead
(One of those two would probably be very happy about this solution)
Sydney just for confusion
It's not an capital but if we exchange it it will be one
And it would be in Austria and not Australia
So people get confused
It was conected by a tram line so its esentially one city anyway
Twin-city, oida
I second this because of the Brno racetrack, a great circuit
Quiet, Swiss backyard boy
Salzburg or Graz sound like a good choice that actually makes sense
Soon with the power of sect and urban planning Vienna will swallow Pressburg and Slovakia as a whole
Yeah lets take a handful of nations and unite them under one flag, but since i am austrian i can tell you that this empire isn't allowed to be ruled by just one nationality so we give every annexed nation seats in a shared government and make it more of a loose union
I hope the name european union isn't used anywhere since that would be the best name for something like that
I'm pretty sure a lot of brits would be happy to join for some more stability since that weird brexit thing threw everything into chaos over there
Hm this seems familiar somehow, I don't really know why though
Correct me if I‘m wrong:
During the times where Habsburg reigned, Prague was actually the most important city, followed by Vienna
The Habsburger wanted to keep on building up Viennas infrastructure because it was one of the most important cities in the Middle of Europe, _because of_ it‘s Geography
Between mountains with very important  trade routs going through it + the Donau going quite literally through Vienna
Only because the Kingdom Austria was formed Vienna became suddenly capital, I‘ll take a wild guess and say because it was the most important city that still belonged to our land
It was right away taken by Napoleon two times btw
So we should send a politition to germany again
We have a handfull of ~~nsdap~~ fpö members who could do the job
Austriae est imperare orbi universo
We Austrians tend to take us way too serious
Glorious days of Kuk monarchy are over, although I have the impression that Austria is still a link between the eastern , the southern and western Europe, economicly and cultural
Vienna also has one of two UN centers (one in New York)
We are a neutral country and therefore contribute to negotiations especially in the Balkans
Nowadays Austria plays a role in the migration politics of the EU with the well known "Balkan route".
I guess our geographic position between Germany and Italy does make us kinda valuable
There's a reason most of the traffic isn't going through Switzerland
Also we're one of the paying countries rather than the receiving countries
Other than that i guess we're rather one of the "good to haves" than the essentials
Although our chancellor tries hard to become the "friendly critical alternative" to the EU criticism of the (alt-)right and Orban
you have the best female bouldering competitor though
mad respect
I feel like if we tried annexing and stirred things up a bit (near the Balkan of all places), people would be very alert indeed
Wow, never heard about the frugal four
You forgot about the beer
Wait, Slovenia isn't a part of Czechoslovakia
Bit bold to assume that Greek people forgot about their ancient history and not just didn't bring it up in this thread about modern Greece because it's just not relevant at all
don't forget Malta :(
We have a conservative government that likes to oppose big state spending
So they teamed up with three other "frugal" governments to fight the big spending plans of the EU commission
Two other factors:
* Austria pays a lot of money to the commission
There have been studies saying that if you count all business etc that we make because of the EU, we still profit - but if you just count "how much money we pay to the institutions and how much money they invest into Austrian", we're losing money
Since the UK left we now have to pay even more
Do our chancellor was like "we won't double our payments, forget that"
* The Conservatives like to use xenophobia
Protesting against  financial help for southern eu countries helps in this regard to secure votes

Public health care requires a public health care agency
Whenever there is a public agency it might get complicated
Like wasting taxpayers money, pulitical influence, political parties and all the other typical issues we know
Here it's an public insurance which is mandatory and you can get additional insurances
The mandatory one covers basically all you need(Well dental Work is Not that good covered) and the additional provide more comfort (e.g. a 2 bed Room in Hospital instead a 4-6)
The downsite I See ist there a doctors, who choose to not fully corporate with the insurances, which results essentially in a "2 class health Care". like He is more expensive than their tarife, so you pay him fully and the insurance pays you their tarife back
It's not that bad as you are taken good care Off in the basic insurance, but still there is the posibillity to Cut waiting time for non life threatening issues when you go to a doctor the working men could not afford
I guess some See this even as plus
According to surgery we also have long waiting times
I had a "surgery" on my ear years ago and had to wait half a year back then
But I could leave the hospital on the same day since it wasn't too big of a surgery and I felt well (despite beeing exhausted)
My grandmother also had to wait for her knee and feet surgery
She stayed a night there but my sister and I brought her home the following day since she would've gotten thrown out anyway
Plus: You don't have to pay for a surgery most of the times and you don't have to pay to visit a doctor
Tho you have to buy your own medicine
And some surgeries aren't free (I had a tooth surgery
It took over years since it had to be done step by step
One of the worst things
I had to pay for that
Thanks to an incompetent dentist I had to go through this)
I don't see this as a downside
I know of someone who wouldn't have been near able to get a surgery because they earned basically no money
I think that paying taxes for Healthcare is the best solution to that problem
Well, the "Proporz" is really a very typical Austrian thing
Social insurances (GKK, SVA etc
) all have their political color here and the bosses of the individual branches always had to be affiliated with a certain political party (SPÖ or ÖVP)
BUT, I think our health system still is working very well besides these issues
Could it be more efficient
Well of course, as every system could be
But it still has an extremly high standard of quality and generally you will get a good treatment when you are sick
Building hospitals goes hand in hand with bribery and a political scandal here, just saying
It has, however op asked about downsides
I could image this being less existent in privately run hospitals
Might other things be going in, but here we have the administration being involved in bribery
Which is a different issue as it is taxpayer's money
Well theres also the issue of severly underpaid civil service labor keeping services afloat
I'd say that is otr very well could have been an emergency
I guess whats meant are people clogging up the ER when they just have a cold or other minor problem that could be easily solved by the family doctor
I cut off the tip of my thumb a few months ago
Disinfected it myself, stopped the bleeding and bandaged it
Got a tetanus shot the next day from my the local doc and a better bandage
No need to clog up the ER and endanger others who think they might have a heart attack
Same here in Austria, but for a US citizen like OP it's all the same, "taxes".
Don't you dare to tell me that the "Energyring" for the mere 95k€ around the new hospital doesn't do its job
Bribery also exists in privately run environments
Just as much as everywhere else where money is involved
But you are right, the difference is the taxpayer's money
I know
But I tried to explain the difference to my American relatives and in the end they said "OK so taxes
All the scandinavian languages
I know that "nokken in the kokken" is "fucking in the kitchen" in swedish
And that's all
The rest is just confusing
German, I am a native german speaker and it still confuses me sometimes

Austro-Fascism
We had our own fasicst dictator called Dollfuß in Austria between the two World Wars
There are many people in Austria who don't know much about this time
The interwar periode
Just watching an Austrian documentation about what was going in just in Austria, in that was insanly much and many things Not covered in History lessons
I don't know anything about the Yugoslav wars although this happened only 20 years ago
I don't know why it started, I don't know who won or why it ended and I don't know which countries were involved
Everything up north or down south
The Roman Empire, Habsburg Empire and all those Empires is about the most we learn about countries that didn‘t do something globally that affected us or are neighboring us
Austria:
my high school started at 7:25 with 50min lessons
No breaks between lessons except 15min break between 3-4 no breaks after that
10mins between 6-7
If i head more than 7 lessons either 6th or 7th was free
10min break between 8-9
3 times a week 10 lessons a day, one day 8 and one 6or7
Trip to school was about 1h.
Left for school at 06:10 and came home (10hday) at 17:30
The first military operation in both World Wars got commanded by an Austrian born guy
Wouldn't it also be the most Belgian thing if they fail to name someone to be the spokesperson of the group and keep on reelecting and yet just don't find someone to do the job
Austria - Tirol
Not the whole country, but the day of the "Blochziehen" is THE day of the year when it happens (only every 4 years) and villages have their own schedules and not many villages do it
Its a pre-christian tradition whrere a huge tree is pulled trough the village on sleds by masked adults
All masked people signify something: the rooster - fertility (if he jumps you it means you'll marry soon), the couple - marriage (they fight a lot, lol), the moss-man - the woods, the bear - hunting
and a lot of traditional professions are there too
Certain people are meant to catch the bear and moss-man and the tree can only go further when they are caught
It means taming nature to stop the winter and start spring
There are several stops and a large stop at the end
At each stop there are food stands and of course small wooden bars
At the last stop the tree is sold in an auction which pays for everything (buying it is more an act of philanthropy as the tree has to be prepped for being pulled and is basically very expensive firewood)
The party afterwards is the stuff of legends
But even better is the after-afterparty a month or so later when everything has been cleaned up
You see, the Blochziehen is a village affair
**Everybody** volunteers working for it
From the richest go the poorest people in town
And as a thank you, you get invited to that party
Drinks and food are covered
It always goes well into the morning and sometimes continues after that at some friends place for breakfast
It will be the talk of town for 4 years until the next Blochziehen comes along
That’s December 5 though
December 24th
December 25th is considered a holiday bur we don‘t do anything on it
It‘s just a holiday
24th on the evening, Christmas dinner ([noodle soup with Frankfurter] and the meat that was used for the soup afterwards, together with close family, parents, grandparents (sometimes close neighbours)
25th is mostly meeting with extended family, aunties, uncles, cousins and so on
If you´d ask me I´d say no, but my intuition has been right quite a few times when travelling abroad and unknowingly having them around me (before hearing them talk of course, which confirmed my assumptions)
I really do not know why, though
I don't feel like there are any specialities genetically or fashion-wise
How about [him]
In my opinion this could be a north sea sailor selling me the best fish in the world with extra omega-3 on TV
looks very weak indeed hope he got better after this photo
ps I still would love to see the pic of a stereotypical iranian :D
I've found that portuguese people often have these dark areas around their eyes, making them look a bit tired/older than they actually are
not a bad thing at all, just something I noticed
is it genetic, a certain style of makeup, or something stemming from windy/sunny climate
You are right but obviously it's about "the most polish" polish person
So obviously black people for examples wouldn't fit that description because most people in poland are white
It's about the commen denominator in the structure of faces
Belgium is unique of course becuase of the Flemmings and Walloons thing
You mean, you are good at distinguishing between these countries, or you could just tell that someone is from *one of* these countries
Don't forget the all-weather jacket
You never know
sounds all very reasonable tbh
wish I was like that, I never plan that far in advance; but especially things like using enough (=more than you think you should) sun screen is just super sensible and will hopefully protect you from skin damage once you're older
The hotspot is Vienna's center of course
But I am sure some skiing areas (like Ischgl) are in the winter season very crowded by tourists too
Of course Vienna, but that’s more in total numbers, not in relation to size
The county of Tyrol is very touristic, the valley where I live, the Zillertal (Zillervalley) alone had 4,5 million nights spend in winter 2015/2016
I woud say it isn't just or skiing areas but most and definitely all the bigger ones
In my opinion everything in Austria is very nice haha
I know all of them if someone talks about them, but can recite maybe 25 from memory, maybe 40 if I really think about it for a while
All of them
Not a chance
We had to learn them in school, like a lot of other stuff, but honestly, the only reason I remember them is A) movies and TV shows (e.g. Minnesota is where Jack O'Neill from Stargate grew up) and B) because no person from the US I've ever met or talked to has ever just said that they are from the US, they always mention the state, often including the city
If it is a large city they sometimes may mention *only* that
By name, I know (all) 50 states
By location, I tried recently and I got like 10-15
And I *think* I know four capitals
New York - Albany, California - Sacramento, Texas - Houston (???), Washington - Washington DC
Still not sure wether or not Floridas capital is Miami
And I think even people who don‘t know anything about the US and can‘t even speak english can point out the bigger states
At least my dad knows states like California, Washington, New York, Minnesota, Florida, and so on
I assume almost no one could list all of them but at least the more educated people would definitely know that these are states in the US
Don't forget, size-wise it's more like me saying "I'm from Austria, it's a country in Europe". If you tell me that you are from Crook County I also wouldn't have any idea that that's in Wyoming or even in the US
Good guess
It's in the South East right next to France
Dover is in Kent
I only know Kent from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, it was pronounced Cænt the time the game takes place
> If it is a large city they sometimes may mention only that
The only one I've never heard was "New York, New York".
> People really know next to nothing about Wyoming Delaware or Nebraska
Well, the question is: would they know those are US states
Well, its easy
Vienna is the Capital of Vienna, and Salzburg is the Capital of Salzburg :P

Hebrew - it’s a lot of fun to learn but at the same time a lot harder for me than the other languages I’ve learned because of the script and the fact that the vowels are not written, plus tons of prefixes and suffixes for prepositions, tenses and such
Wouldn't have it any other way
Absolutely
Fuck yeah
On the other hand - we now have the option to say on a Friday afternoon "I have nothing to do this weekend, fuck it I'm going to see Warsaw" without any kind of planning
Buy a train ticket, look for a hotel/AirBNB while sitting in the train
I can only recommend spontaneous trips like that
You must promise to to tell anyone but [^^birds ^^aren't ^^real]
E: not it's the proper phrase
Esotericism or whatever its called and homeopathy, especially in rural regions
Also  astrology
Heck, on the biggest radio station in the country there is a horoscope every day
And there's something similar to the Reichsbürger, but in Austria it's not common at all
But they also believe that Austria somehow is a fake state and in reality it's still the first republic or the empire, but I don't really know much about that
Chemtrails are pretty popular
Then there's the theory that Jörg Haider didn't die in a drunk driving accident, but it was a conspiracy by Mossad/CIA/German BND/George Soros/(((the Jews)))
There's also A LOT of people who believe HC Strache and Gudenus were not drunk in the Ibiza video, but they were drugged and somehow led to say all those things, totally not their fault
Whose fault is it you ask
Of course Mossad/George Soros/(((the Jews)))
Didn't help that Strache's wife and Gudenus himself kinda implied so themselves
So like the india superpower by 2020 meme
Birds are government surveillance drones
They were all replaced in the 50s.
"birds aren't real" is a general meme that I think comes out of the hacker community
No (yes)
Yeah, sure, shill
The claim is that there was never a peace treaty after WW2 or something so the whole construct of post-ww2 republics does not exist and such
Weird ppl
Clearly that was a hostile takeover of the Deutsche demokratische Genossenschaft by the Bundesrepublik GmbH
The way I know the conspiracy theory, there was no treaty in either side of Germany
But honestly I don't care enough about the Germans to actually research it
Also m2c it's completely irrelevant because a state is defined through recognition both internationally and within its population (as well as the ability to enforce its statehood and laws), so it's completely irrelevant if there is a contract or not
That's exactly what a government bot would say, don't trust his words
That's what she told you
Not German, but I think so can still answer in the spirit of the question
Yea, one did serve in WW2, I sadly don't know exactly where, and why (if he volunteered or got drafted)
Anyway, he got injured by a grenade fragment in his right knee which gave him an out and made him unable to return into service until the end of the war, which was his luck I guess
Afaik it didn't much affect him in the rest of his life
Also he never talked about his time in the Wehrmacht at all with me or my dad, so that's all I know
My great-grandfather was drafted and stationed somewhere in Yugoslavia
He had a few encounters with partisans, luckily he was wounded sometimes, I don't know why and how but because of that he couldn't serve anymore
I don't really know much about him since I never met him
My grandfathers both were born during WW2 so they weren't old enough to serve
I don't really know about my other great-grandparents
Neither of them talked about it and died before I got curious
I guess there is the unspoken rule of don't ask, don't tell about this topic in Austria
One Grandpa worked at a flight field near Graz as electrician
The other one I've found mainly pics from his company in front of train wagons
One great grandfather got wounded in Stalingrad and flown out with the last plane before it all went down
His two younger brothers had just minor injuries so they had to stay in Stalingrad
He never heard of them again
(Rumor has it that he had sympathy for the nazis first)
The other great grandfather was sent to Ukraine
His sick wife was left behind and had to do all the hard farm work on her own
She died when my grandma was 8 of exhaustion
(Was always a unpolitical man and hated the nazis from the beginning)
Aaand another great grandfather was also sent to the eastern front and became a russian war prisoner for 10 years
When he returned home he had just 46kg despite being 1,90 tall and his kids didn’t know him
(I guess he was a bit fond of Hitler in the beginning hence they were from the same town and he named my Grandpa Adolf, but never wanted to talk about it after war)
Not german, but I had 2 grandfathers drafted into the german army
One was drafted near the end of the war and was then killed by a soviet grenade near Vienna
The other one was drafted in 1941 and was then captured by the soviets and spent many years in a Gulag
Gladly he made it home pretty much unhurt and lived a great life until 1989
I never knew him personally, but there are tapes of him telling stories from the war
Neither of my two grandparents did much during the war
One was way too young, since he was born in 1937
All I know about him is that his dad (my great grandfather), who was a fanatic Nazi, planned to make him attend some kind of Hitler youth school
The other one apparently hid himself in the woods or something to avoid getting drafted
(I don't really know much about him because he died in the 60s)
Only the two brothers of my granny actually fought in WW2
One was at the western front and later POW under the British
Now her second brother probably had it the worst of them all
He was drafted into the Wehrmacht when he was 18 and directly sent to good old Stalingrad
During the battle he almost died due to a grenade (there is still a splinter of it in his body) and later on he obviously was a POW in the Soviet Union
I am amazed that despite living through hell for a few years, he's still going strong with 95 years
Austrian here
One of my great-grandfathers was on the battlefield somewhere in Croatia on the nazi side
As I heard, he looked eye to eye at an Croatian soldier
Both had rifles in their hand
Both didnt shoot
Both turned around and ran away
I'm not sure how true this story is
I think its pretty true because everything else I know about this particular great-grandfather is not that nice (he cheated, was abusive to his son, ...) so I think this story is true even though it's kinda hard to believe
Not German but close enough
Two of my great-grandparents served in the war
The one on my mothers-side was in the SS, don't know how he survived
I was told that he was a horrible man and did awful thing in the name of the third reich
He always said that he was only following the masses but that was a flat out lie
Talking about him is kind of a taboo topic in the family but sometime they talk about him a little
When we cleaned out his old house we found several letters and a nazi flag
On my fathers-side my great-grandpa was only in the Wehrmacht
He was in some of the worse battles on the eastern front and he fought in Stalingrad
He survived and was captured as a POW and sent of to Siberia (not entirely sure) but he later came home all the way by foot
From what I heard he was a relatively good man, altough you never know what he did on the eastern front
If you have any questions, please ask them, I will try to answer them as good as possible
Not my dad, but I work in a care home for senior citizens in Austria and one of my clients told me his story
He was drafted age 17 in 1942
He had to leave his hometown in southern Austria and travel all the way up to the North sea, where he was trained to become a tank driver
He fought on the Western front after the D-Day invasion
During the Battle of the Bulge, his small tank was hit by an allied anti tank
His friend and commander died on impact
Over the radio he was ordered to continue the assault, now alone in his tank with this dead buddy in the same compartment
He lost his will to fight at that point (if he ever head any) but he was afraid of repercussions if he retreated
So he turned the gun of the tank upwards to the back of the vehicle and slowly drove towards the enemy, white napkin hanging out of the hatch
After being surrounded by a British unit he surrendered and became a POW
He spent about a year in a camp in Belgium where he had to dismantle military vehicles
After that, he was later transferred to a camp in France where he stayed until some time 1946, when he returned home to Austria
Not a German, but an Austrian
My grand father served from 1939 to 1945 where he was imprisoned somewhere in Siberia
He was really lucky though as he got released in autumn 1945 without any organs or kneecaps taken away from him
He died long before I was born but according to my father, he didn't want to talk a lot about the war
There is only one situation during the German-Soviet war he talked about once, the one where they were surrounded and forced to surrender
A few years after my grand father returned home, a bullet fraction was removed from his arm
I just know that one hreat-grandfather served and died in an US prisoner camp
Not German, but my grand-father was drafted and had to serve in Crimea
He almost died in the [Crimean Offensive] but he was sent back early to Germany because he had to train new soldiers on how to use a Granatwerfer 34
He almost ended up in a POW camp near Cologne - but since he was originally from a farm he was sent to work on a farm with 4 or 5 other POWs, which was pretty "good" compared to the regular POWs in camps
Not German, but my grandfather had an interesting story
He was an orphan and volunteered for the paratroopers (Fallschirmjäger) in 1940, when he was 17 years old
I'm not sure what he did in the early years of the war, but in 1943 he participated in the Gran Sasso Raid, also called Operation Oak
In this raid German paratroopers freed Benito Mussolini from captivity
Later, in 1944, he was stationed near Normandy (I'm not sure exactly where, sadly
) Shortly after the Allied landing, he deserted and was taken in by a French family
He stayed with them for a couple years (even after the war had ended) and visited them again decades later
I also remember my parents gifting him a flight with an old Ju 52 (the plane he jumped out of as a paratrooper) for his birthday at some point
I know the story of two of my great-grandfathers as well, but they aren't quite as interesting as his, just sad really
EDIT: Something I forgot to mention, he did get the Iron Cross during the war
I'm not sure but I think he may have gotten it for his actions during the Gran Sasso Raid
On my mothers side: great-grandfather was a master carpenter and served in a pioneer regiment
Somehow he became a POW in Switzerland at the end of the war
On my fathers side: my grandfather never talked about it, but it was an open secret that he had been a SS officer
>I always thought that story was impressive, but your relative's sounds moreso
either way, it's insane the degree to which war and devestation can push people
My uncles father walked home from Stalingrad
It's unimaginable for me
Yea, it's a really interesting thing tbh
I would have loved to talk about it with my grandfather, but he passed when I was still in primary school so I could never really talk to him about it
No, he is my half-uncle
One of his fathers is my grandpa but the other one isn't.
Well the German Wikipedia is the 2nd biggest (if you exclude the Swedish and Cebuano one, which are mostly bot generated) after the English one
For some regional stuff, or local celebrities it's better than the English one
I don't use it for much else
It's pretty decent but the community ist pretty akward
I added much pics, mostly self taken of geographic or achictecture content, but I stoped ages ago
Also my account was suspended, idk why, all I'ce done is adding m own pics under a CC license and asked in the discussion pages If there is more Proof to Things I've found online to some topics
The German wikipedia has been the second most comprehensive after the English one for quite a while (don't know if this is still the case tho), so I used whichever happens to have the more detailed article
Sometimes I use both
Sometimes I use the English one as a dictionary for technical/professional terminology
I look up the German term and switch to the English article
Interestingly, in scientific topics the German wiki is sometimes even better, more extensive, or at least has different information compared to the English one
But I usually use the English one
My first search for generic topics is always in English, the German one I only use only for specific local things
And even then, it’s most likely so specificly German that it doesn’t apply to Austria
And Germans gatekeep the German Wiki pretty well, so sometimes a more generic Google search yields better results
German Wikipedia:
&#x200B;
Controversial topics, eg
politics, corruption cases, war histories, etc
etc
As with many Wiki languages, the whole Internet, and all other media, you'll find plenty of bias and lies
Never rely on a single source
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Admins: "Some" people say that German Wiki admins extensively delete everything that doesn't fit their personal opinion
(I'm not giving any statement if this is true or not)
&#x200B;
Country-specific things, eg laws, taxes, government agencies etc
As German is the main language in several countries, sometimes articles have subsections for Germany, Austria, etc
But other times, it describes just one country, and neither from the structure nor the text details it is visible which one
Requiring other sites than Wikipedia, to check which country this applies to, is bothersome
Of course, in principle the same problem exists in English Wikipedia, but at least I have the impression it's much more clear there
I don't have to guess of some information is meant for UK only, another country, or worldwide
&#x200B;
Science problem 1: Link forest
If you want to find a quick overview about what an ABC (placeholder) is, relatively often you'll find descriptions like "An ABC is if combine \[link to DEF\] and \[link to GHI\] and \[link to JKL\] and \[link to MNO\], and DEF/GHI/JKL/MNO are not basic knowledge but equally complicated
So if you don't know ABC yet it's unlikely that you know these other things and first need to learn about these (and they again have links to other topics)
&#x200B;
Science problem 2: Malicious textbook authors
For topics that are usually taught in university courses and schools, sometimes (often
) Wikipedia articles are written by people who also made books targetted at students
If you buy the book, you'll find an easily understandable 3-line description there
At the same time Wikipedia has two pages of complicated text that contains plenty of unnecessary steps etc
, to "punish" people who didn't buy their book
Only after spending hours to understand the article, you'll realize that 90% was useless
&#x200B;
Other than these big problems, articles can be quite useful
The best and worst thing about German Wikipedia is the high quality control
Articles are very neutral, comprehensive and nearly all information is backed by external sources
But that only works because changes are not published until they are through a quality control
I have published for english, italian, french, spanish, polish and danish Wikipedia and everywhere my changes were live immediately
In German Wikipedia you need 200 approved changes, before you can publish changes immediately
For beginners it is very frustrating sometimes, because your changes are often rejected for formal reasons
And German Wikipedians love to discuss and preach their holy rules
Yea, according to [Wikipedia] its 99% bot generated
That's amazing
German makes sense since German speaking Europe had the second largest internet presence after the anglosphere in the early days, but why Catalan
Was there an early wikipedia enthusiast from Catalonia
Our drinking water is so good, I've heard that some people bottle it up and sell it overseas
Like Voss, but probably less expensive
Sure
Viennas water is mostly mountain spring water
Couldn't get any better
Most of the country has the same quality, in some other areas it doesn't taste that great but most people still drink it
Also Voss sold in the US is actually bottled in the US, not in Norway
Also Vienna water is fucking cold
In the summer its the most refreshing drink you can get
It doesn't taste bad, it just tastes different
Like I prefer my hometown water to the water in the city I study, but it is still good
This is actually true for a lot of countries, not just scandinavia
Depends on how old you are, but as far as I can remember we always had great tap water
Here, they don’t even sell these 5l water jugs like they do in Spain and Italy
If it is from a public water network, it is normally perfectly clean
But in the countryside many people still have their own well
There the water is not always good
Before we were connected to public water, we also didn't drink the water from our well
The tap water in Austria is very hard (=has a lot of lime in it)
It is perfectly healthy and also contains important minerals
But some people think that it's unhealthy so this might be the reason
I have never seen anyone drinking sparkling water on a mountain
True
Thats what Vienna water is
During the time of the Austrian empire they built huge waterpipes from the alps straight into the city
LOL, I can guarantee then that it was not the tap water that made your brother sick
Must have been a coincidence
Or someone had some really badly maintained pipes
Berlin going strong as well
It's relaxing, isn't it
Bydgoszcz in Poland (German: Bromberg) for me
Never heard of it
After that I didn't know Plovdiv (BG), Bielefeld (I'm pretty sure they made that one up), and Craiova (RO)
I also came across a bunch of other Polish cities which I hadn't heard of (Szczecin, Poznań, Wrocław), but when I read the German names (Stettin, Posen, Breslau), I realized I *have* heard of them
Valenzia
And down from there all spanish cities
I‘m sorry, I‘m terrible at spanish geography
Poznań in Poland
Also don't know any details about Gothenburg in Sweden which is a few spots above it (bit it does sound familiar at least)
ooh it's one of those cities that are awesome to pronounce in an andalusian accent
zzzzz
> Iași
how about Jassenmarkt :)
Also, Zaragoza is the only city name in Spain, where every single vocal is stressed ;)
Wutsch, I knew it
Nah this is pronounced *Wutsch* (in German)
Build a solid foundation of standard German first then have lots of conversation to learn the dialect
Learn articles with the nouns
But don't stress out about them
Its pretty much a lifelong process to learn them
And be sure to ask to speak German if you ever want to train with native speakers
Because most will immediately jump to English if they're capable of it and notice you're a foreigner
Don't bother
lmao you can taste the irony
Excessive lighting is called "Festbeleuchtung" in my household (Festival lighting) but idk if it's austrian, my mom grew up in east germany
Not tidying your room: It looks like a pig's sty in here
Eastern Saxony it is
Since 1918 it is forbidden to use a title of nobility in Austria
Since then the fine of 20
000 Kronen (the currency back then) has never been increased
So it is only 14 cents now
So you can't call yourself like "King Michael VI
"? Or Duke Of Pöstlingbergbahn"? I hope I understood that right
how do you he is Scottish
We have the same in Austria
I never understood for what it is worth, but since our last Right-Right government I happily pay for it, because without it the public news media cannot be independent since it is not tax and goes directly to those institutions
They tried a lot to get rid of this system and to control the public media (ORF)
For example they wanted to get rid of Radio Ö1 which does a very good news coverage and educational program
But they failed due to popular support of the channel
There are many other countries who have this as well, Germany, France Japan come to mind
You can't change your name to that officially
If you want to use invented titles as a Nickname, I think there's no problem
Also foreign titles are allowed, when I'm not mistaking
As the law has never been reworked, it is not very detailed
It mainly says, there is no nobility anymore in Austria and no privilege of nobility
Even the Habsburg family is not allowed to call themselves "von Habsburg". However, the Dutch "van" is allowed
As a masochistic epileptic I think that's very discriminating
It depends - there are some clear rules how to write words on German and people sure would have a certain success rate in writing an unknown word correctly if they are already good at orthography
But if somebody would tell me a word while speaking in a dialect it would get very difficult
Also Austrians make very little difference between p and b, t and d as well as between g and k.
And the borders between f, v and w are overlapping in German in general
I know it will be gramatically totally wrong, but I just thought of the sentence "near that green glass worm" and thought of it as "vers vert verre ver" :D
(Dialekt) I woas ned wosd moansd, wia lawan e wiama schreim
(Writen) Ich weiß nicht was du meinst, wir labern (is that the standard german word
We would most likely write "reden" instead) so wie wir schreiben
(English) I don't know what you are talking about, we are speaking exactly like we write
Please do not forget that every dialect does contain mostly unwritten work arounds for some words or vowels

Same in Austria
honestly thought that's from Schüssel
I prefer "haisl".
Rural-West Austria: Oachkatzlschwoaf
Oachkatzl is dialect for Eichkätzchen/Eichhörnchen which means Squirrel
Schwoaf is Dialect for Schweif which means Tail
It is difficult to pronounce the hard Ch in this word
German speakers speak the Ch a lot softer and for foreigners, especially English speakers, it is even more challenging as they pronounce it like the C in Car
Oachkatzlschwoaf (Eichkätzchenschweif=squirrels tail)
You forgot your røget ørred med røræg (smoked trout with scrambled eggs)
As others have mentioned, in Austria it would be Oachkatzlschwoaf (squirrel tail)
Not people who don‘t speak our language but Germans, who don’t speak our dialect, actually lol
Things like Oil, moose, an old, not really livable house or smth and other stuff are kinda weird to pronounce for people who only know German (/Standard german)
We here in Styria (at least where I live) kinda say öü/ø-ü (a mix between both, leaning more towards öü) instead of Öl (Oil), which I always think is funny because no German dares to pronounce it the first time
Moose is kinda the same (the El of Elch if pronounced the same kinda) with a ch at the end
And an old house where you can‘t really live in anymore is a Kaischn
And if Germans ask me to pronounce Oachkatzlschwoaf (Squirreltail - Eichhörnchenschweif) I ask them how they would pronounce it first
Sometimes it‘s really funny
So there's the story behind the band name 'Sektion Kuchikäschtli'
That's the hardest one in this thread for me hahaha
Although not as hard to say we have vowel only phrases as well in Austria:
A e? I a.
Is that so
Me too/so do I.
It‘s confirmed: Squirrel is hard to pronounce in any language lmao
My favourite of these in German German has always been "Keule", which means "club/bat".
>These are only used if you talk about them
Talking with them you use their names or pet names
Pretty sure this whole thread is about talking with your friends
Dietrich of Bern, as a mythical version of Theodoric the Great, has more tights to northern Italy and the Huns
(Welsch-Bern is old German name for Verona)
He has also done Cameos in Germanic and Northern sagas (he has even it's own, the Thidrekssaga)
> Welsch-Bern is old German name for Verona
Verona > Berona > Berna > Bern
Nah, king gave it away, she didn't steal it
Rightfully hers
And "Welsch" is an old word for Italian or romance speaking people
AFAIK it comes from the Germanic word for Romans
It means both Romance-speaker and Celtic-speaker, depending on the context
E.g. Welsch is related to Wales, Wallachia and Walnut etc
etc
That word has a complicated and very long history
The opposite to it would be Wends (see: Windische, Windischgarsten etc
) and refers to Slavic speakers
For reference:
Mostly New Year's eve, and certain festivals like the *Danube Island* free music festical in Vienna
But I assume fireworks will die out in the next years — many people now see them as a barbaric outdated custom that's morally wrong for 101 different reasons
I like that last Swede, we should name a price after him
I'll take Matteo Guendouzi and 1£
This one is from the early times of Austria, during the crusades:
At the siege of Akkon in the year 1191, Leopold V. of Austria got into an argument with Richard the Lionheart, the english king
Their argument ended with Richard throwing Leopolds flag into the dirt, causing the enraged Leopold to travel back to Austria
Later, on his way back to England, Richard was forced to travel through austrian territories
He ended up being captured and imprisoned, and was released for a hefty payment of 6000 buckets of silver
In the end, an argument about who has the right to raise his flag on the tower of Akkon resulted in a new defensive wall for Vienna and 2 new cities being founded in Austria
Ridiculous in a more tragic way, maybe, but I think the way we lost the democratic first Republic might be a good more "recent" contender
Roughly, this is what happened on 4
March 1933:
A vote is held in parliament, it goes through 82 to 79
This turns out incorrect, it was 81 to 80, but still fine sais head of parliament
Christian Socialist Party Members disagree strongly, call for re-vote
First Head of Parliament, a Socialdemocrat, steps down from his position (most likely) so he can vote in a potential re-vote
Second Head of Parliament, a Christian Socialist, annulls vote
Now the Socialdemocrats are protesting
Second Head of Parliament also steps down, probably for similar reasons
Third head of Parliament immediately also steps down for some reason unknown
The Parliament now has no head, this is not supposed or expected to happen and pretty much means it is unable to act
They decide to leave for today, since they can't really do anything, not even close the meeting properly
This situation should be solvable reasonably fast and easy, since the Austrian constitution is fairly well made
Unfortunately the Chancellor wanted to be a dictator, so no
Instead, the Police prevented the Parliament from reassembling and dealing with it and Dolfuß and pals use the opportunity for a coup
The president doesn't stop him
Democracy proceeds to go bye-bye
Honestly, the entire first republic seems to have been just one ridiculous mess after another
Other highlights include "Socialist Uprising, but they can't find their weapon stashes because their messengers are caught and there was apparently no backup plan for this", "Chancellor-Dictator calls Nazis and Hitler Evil, probably for religious and power reasons (and proceeds to be shot by Nazis)" "Vorarlberg tries to join Switzerland but they say no" "Nazi Party has internal disagreement over being democratic (they decide on no and turn to terrorism instead" and of course "Whatever the fuck Schuschnigg was doing in '38".
The [Battle of Karánsebes] Basically the Austrian army hurt itself in confusion
10,000 died
It all started with a dispute over Schnaps
> The army of Austria, approximately 100,000 strong, was setting up camp around the town
The army's vanguard, a contingent of hussars, crossed the Timiș River to scout for the presence of the Ottoman army
There was no sign of the Ottoman forces, but the hussars came across a group of Romani people, who offered to sell schnapps to the weary soldiers
The cavalrymen bought the schnapps and started to drink
> Soon afterwards, some infantry crossed the river
When they saw the party going on, the infantrymen demanded alcohol for themselves
The hussars refused to give them any of the schnapps and, still drunk, set up makeshift fortifications around the barrels
A heated argument ensued, and one soldier fired a shot
> Immediately, the hussars and infantry engaged in combat with one another
During the conflict, some infantry began shouting, "Turci
Turci
" ("Turks
Turks
The hussars fled the scene, thinking that the Ottoman army's attack was imminent
Most of the infantry also ran away; the army comprised Austrians, Serbs, Croats, and Italians from Lombardy, as well as other minorities, many of whom could not understand one another
While it is not clear which one of these groups did so, they gave the false warning without telling the others, who promptly fled
The situation was made worse when officers, in an attempt to restore order, shouted, "Halt
Halt
" which was misheard by soldiers with no knowledge of German as "Allah
Allah
> As the hussars fled through the camps, a corps commander, General of Artillery Colloredo, thought that it was a cavalry charge by the Ottoman army and ordered artillery fire
Meanwhile, the entire camp awoke to the sound of battle; rather than waiting to see what the situation was, everyone fled
The troops fired at every shadow, thinking the Ottomans were everywhere; in reality, they were shooting fellow Austrian soldiers
The incident escalated to the point where the whole army retreated from the imaginary enemy, and Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II was pushed off his horse into a small creek
> Two days later, the Ottoman army arrived
They discovered dead and wounded soldiers and easily took Karánsebes
The [battle of Karánsebes]
Basically two regiments fought over some alcohol, someone thought there were turks, and all of them fled back to the main army
The main army however, who heard the shots fired previously, assumed whatever was coming their way was a Turkish army, so they opened fire
It got to a point where emperor Josef II waa pushed off his horse
Wiener Neustadt-founded via ransom money
> When you go ro live to another EU country you are like and have to be treated like a national of the country you are living now, same rights, same duties, same benefits, same taxes
Exception: national voting rights
You're only allowed to vote in your country of residence  on a municipial level (in most cases), sometimes *I think* on a regional level (definitely no in Austria though) and in EU-elections
On a national level you still vote in the country you're a citizen in, not your country of residence
It is in Austria
If you do not have a job/place of study after 3 months or can't prove you are financially self reliant (meaning you do not need the social security net) you are ordered to leave, if you do not comply you get deported
Main reason for that is that social security payments in Austria are tripple that of wages in some of the poorer parts of Romania and eastern Slovakia, which are quite close
>Similarly some countries stop allowing their citizens to vote if they live abroad for too long
So they can end up having no right to vote anywhere
I did not know that
That is kinda fucked up
The world headquarter of Red Bull is in Austria, in [this Bond-villainesque complex] in Salzburg, owned by [this Bond villian]
The Duke of Austria and his quarrel with Richard I of England gave Austria a few chests of money and provided England with several half mythical heroes  and Villains(Robin Hood, Ivanhoe ...) to populate several hollywood films and animes
[According to this post] and [this list] we have the oldest flag design of any sovereign state in Europe, and the world, going back to 1230
Not the oldest national flag in use by any sovereign state (that would be of course Denmark, going back to at least 1370), but the oldest flag for the region that was the core of today's Austria (i.e. Lower and Upper Austria)
* If I‘m correct (if not, correct me), we were the first european country to banish the death penalty
Sadly, we introduced it again and then years later banished it again, so France was the first country to banish it forever
* One thing I‘m sure about however is that we have the oldest zoo in the world
[Tiergarten Schönbrunn (Vienna Zoo)] It was founded in 1752
It also is one of 10 European zoos that are able to have pandas
The first panda baby of Europe was born in Schönbrunn in 2008 afaik
(Idk how many people know about this, I just love to say it because I love zoos that are able to support endangered species)
In 1976, every Austrian was entitled to buy 1 [„Babenberger Münze“] which is a Gold coin noted at 1000 Schilling (ATS)
The interesting thing is that everyone could buy one in this year without having to pay taxes for it
[Same here
] They have had their house in the center of Vienna since 1222
AFAIK that is even their "global headquarter" since 1809
Don't know if they also own farms/land, but I would assume they do
And how much percent of the Ketamine consumption
I‘ve never heard Germany x Austria x Switzerland be referred to as DACH and am wondering why I didn‘t think of that
I love it
another interesting one, sushi has only become a widespread dish in Japan since after the introduction of uninterrupted cooling logistics
before, it was a thing only in some coastal areas
Yeah that's a nice story
But not a historical fact
Omg now that‘s cute
I love that
That‘d be perfect XD
Except there's no fight, it just changes all the time
Also, it's not a frozen rock in the middle of nowhere, [but a cute little green island with trees and shit, and a small monument] I think you can also go fishing there
Last time I drove by, I saw someone at least
Not so long after = earliest records of adopting it are from the mid 14th century [according to the official website of Denmark, denmark
dk] That's over a hundred years of difference
I don't remember if it was July or August
1219-1370 is around 150 years
I don't hate them
Cashiers use them for change money
I use them sometimes to pay the exact amount, and the cashier is happy to receive them because it makes it less likely to run out of them
So, what's the problem
&#x200B;
Sure, it has downsides
But "everyone hates them and no one uses them" is plain wrong
So the reason why our money is spent on those small coins is so that we can be tricked into spending more money
Got it
Except no merchant will round down, it just goes up
No I don't.
Just multiple spelling errors
Have retailers in Italy, Ireland etc gone bankrupt
So how would it be a problem for German retailers
Some prices will go to 2 and some to 1
How is that complicated
That souldn't be legal
In fact, if a price is 1,99 or something like that I don't let them keep the 1-cent  out of principle: If a shop wants to trick us with those bs prices, at least they should have the expenses of keepin lots of 1-cent coins at hand
Sorry I don't understand what you saying
Sure, but this wasn't a reason why we need to keep them anyways
Just saying that not everyone hates then, and people do use them
Well clearly it is cheaper to pay lobbyists to make sure nothing changes :-)
I think you are misunderstanding something
Nothing about this is any complicated
The price is 1
99, you pay 2
The price is 1
97, you pay 1
There is really no thinking involved there
There is no difference between cash and card from the way it is now
You just don't give out 1 and 2 cents
And old cashier women are typically way better with numbers than any of us young people
>By the way if you have this thing in your country for certain time, you sure don't find this complicated, but for me, who heard this for first time
I get the idea but it would be hard to implement
I have heard Finland and a few other countries are using that
Why do you think its hard to implement
"Hey guys, don't return 1 and 2 cent pieces, just round to the nearest 5
" and boom its implemented
I don't mean pricing 1,99 should be illegal, it should be illegal to say so but then keep more of your money
Which in the end is just a ploy to get people to pay with card instead of cash
Except for those cases where it would round down instead of up
That would be a more or less good system, except I can't see it ever becoming reality, because greed
Well, I am all for discontinuing 1 and 2 cent coins if at the same time pricing stopps that would need 1 or two cent coins
Make it 1,95 or 2€, but don't lie to me
Well, learned something today
If 1 and 2 cent coins are abolished, I'm absolutely sure that not all EU countries would adopt Swedish rounding
There will be governments that go "fuck consumers, retailers can round how they want".
Pretty much the same as you described here in Austria
Boy scouts are Pfadfinder
Yes
Carnuntum probably has the best preserved ruins - mostly just foundations, floor mosaics and such
And the remains of an amphitheatre
Vienna also was founded as a Roman city, so when digging in the city center they regularly find remains
I quite literally live on one
Vindobona was a Roman city where Vienna is now
There are still a lot of artifacts and old buildings (in the ground of course)
There's a museum about it also
Same goes for the city of Linz in Upper Austria
Both Linz (Roman "Lentia") and Vienna (Roman "Vindobona") were fortifications at the Danube, which was the Limes/border between the Roman empire and what the Romans called Germania
Lentia was in fact devastated several times by invading Germanic tribes
If you remember the beginning of the movie Gladiator, where Russel Crow's character goes north to a military camp to fight in a battle against Germanic tribes
It is supposed to take place in  [Vindobona] at the end of the [Marcomannic Wars] which is also where [Marcus Aurelius] died in 180 AD (not just in the movie)
Flavia Solva is a small one, there is a café wher you can look through glass at the Roman foundations
Don't forget Enns or Lauriacum - the oldest settlement in Austria
(iirc)
Opus - Live is Life: [
Until today, Falco is probably the most known austrian singer, so I guess ["Vienna Calling"] or ["Rock me Amadeus"] would probably fit here
A bit late to the party, but as I'm reading this the song is played in the background in an construction office in Sweden
some Austrians here, but mostly Swedes and Germans
Still playing that Austrian tunes lol
I'm not a Schlager fan at all but Griechischer Wein is a master piece
You are calling Falco guilty pleasure
Ausbürgerungsverfahren wird eingeleitet
Reminds me of more calm Tropico songs
Now I have
I am speechless
Ah scheiße, i hätt gmoat de woin wissn wos hoid berühmt is
Zu spät, der Abschiebflug geht in einer Stunde
feeling at least somewhat insulted when you get called German is rather universal
And after this horrendous claim we educate that person, that Hitler was born in Austria and because of this, we are supirior to the Germans
For whatever reason
I was thinking the exact same
spotted the Bavarian
Lolwut
I never do this haha
I’m from Austria, we also think putting ketchup on pasta is disgusting atleast I do
I have never seen anybody, beside a German, commit to such a kitchen-crime
Probably also about ketchup on pizza
With Mozart we Austrians are not on the same page
Because when mozart was born Salzburg (his birthplace) was not with "Austria". Salzburg was its own archdiocese
So Mozart is from Salzburg
If you ask someone from Salzburg he/she will tell you this
Thats something i can agree on
I think he means that being German is nothing to be proud of, because it's not an accomplishment, but just pure luck in the genetic lottery
Be proud of what you did, not where you are from
That goes for all countries
Nope, Salzburg is a liked state
I don't know what nutvillager wants to say
With that logic Nikola Tesla would be considered Austrian
And try to tell a Croatian or Serbian that Tesla was Austrian
I only did that once (as a joke) haha
Doesn't take that long, no
German speakers are easy to identify and once you switch to German you can easily tell which country they're from
Yes, it was a few years a ago in Italy, we were  there with our school
On our last day there we got really Drunk with our Italien Friends, to the point,  where I spoke somewhat drunken english with a guy From my school and we didn't realise until we sobered up a bit
Happend to my dad at work
He was having a meeting with partners from Montenegro and they all sat together speaking English
It took a while for my dad to discover that one of the guys was actually from his own company and could speak German
The other guy also didnt know my dad was from Austria so they spoke English with each other the entire time
Happened to me in Spanish
Dude had a first name that is very common in Austria, but a flawless Argentinian accent
He didn't switch to German even though he was aware I was Austrian, so we just kept talking in Spanish for >10 minutes
I just thought, sure if he insists
Turns out we even was from my region
even from their english accent you can tell them apart most of the time
What savage walks over red
You have to respect the Ampelmann
Or, specifically in Vienna, the [Ampelpärchen]
It's usually handed to you personally or to a neigbhour, but since Corona most Services Just leave them now at door
Was never stolen or tampered with, but some services are rather creative and put them at my basement door which I don't use everyday so I find a suprise packaga after wondering why the Status ist delivered but nothing came
Nope, after the second delivery attempt if no one is home we get a yellow letter or an e-mail informing us where to get the package and by showing the letter at the counter we get our package
(usually the closest post office) :∆
no, since packages are normally delivered and signed, or taken back
sometimes they're left with neighbors or in [shared parcel boxes] if any are installed
porches are rare, if packages are left on terraces or the like they're normally not visible from the street
I'm pretty sure it's Mariupol
The main attraction of the city is a statue of the metallurgist
"Soulless" is such a stupid designation to give to a place
Not every single city has to entertain and amaze you as a visitor
To the people living there it is their world with emotional value attached to it
Hannover
Had to spend 2 hours there before going to the airport
Was depressed after 10 minutes
I've never seen a place that dull
Pölten, the capital of lower Austria, is ugly as hell
Berlin
I always thought Linz was a soulless city with nothing but industry and the main shopping street which is compared to salzburg or innsbruck quite unimpressive
After moving to Linz I have found many cute and interesting places which i just never stumbled upon when visiting the city
Now i think Linz is more interesting than Salzburg because it's cheaper and less crowded and it doesn't feel so "stuck up" like Salzburg around the time of the "Festspiele".
nice destination for a bike trip; all the bars having outside seating make the old town a nicer place than Vienna, tbh
Freiberg is nice
the Phoenix park is great
I'd still visit
Mostly because I'd love to finally visit Ukraine, but anyway
Grew up in Linz
I still hate it with a passion :D But I'm happy that there are some people who enjoy it
Same experience, but with St
Pölten (I know, I know)
It's actually very green, things are not far apart and lately the public transport (bus network) is getting somewhere as well
Walking the 10 minutes from the train station along nice baroque buildings and then being surrounded by greenery along the Traisen bike path, I now like it more than Vienna sometimes
Who would've thought
My personal entry for soulless city is "Horn on a foggy day in October".
And overrun by Austrian tourists drinking cheap beer, and full of ugly souvenir shops
Oh I'm happy you liked it so much
I feel like Linz is a little less "in your face" with its attractions so you have to either look for them or know someone for a really good time(or just be lucky)
Yes the old dubliner is a really nice bar but can be quite crowded on saturdays
One of the christmas markets i right in front of my house which means i won't have to cook for the next 3 weeks, absolutely amazing
I hope you will find another reason to visit it again although i wouldn't put too much faith in the LASK
oh no
may i ask what you hate about it
Or is it just a general hate
The fact that I grew up in one of the quarters made up of ugly 70s *Wohnblöcke* (think Neue Heimat) surely didn't help :D It's a pretty little old town, surrounded by a lot of hideousness
Also, I don't like its utter whiteness - it was the Führers favourite city for a reason
And also, I seriously never felt so unsafe in another place, and I have lived in several big cities around the world
oooh yes these are hideous :( They recently renovated a few of them but it didn't help much :D
Whiteness
Well the Führer would luckily be devasted if he'd walk through one of the parks/franckviertel/the trainstation but i guess this changed more since 2015
Really
ok i guess that's subjective as it is very save
guess it also depends on the district you're in
I live in the nice, clean ond town district so it's great but I'm sure I wouldn't like it that much if i lived further away from the Landstraße.
Oh, I was attacked once on Landstraße, and once on the Hauptplatz
By white guys, both times
But maybe it has changed a bit since, I only go there to see my parents
sadly the problems nowadays are mostly refugees stabbing each other
They even introduced a weaponsban in the old town area
Probably it would make more sense to invest in education and social infrastructure than into a militia of half-wits ... but what do I know
I once had somebody say „Das Wetter ist schwul“ instead of „Das Wetter ist schwül“ because they didn‘t have umlauts on their keyboard
Schwül means humid/timid weather, schwul means gay
And I always use it as an example as to why umlauts are important and you can‘t just replace them with u, o and a lmao
knackwurst
kackwurst
knackwurst is a type of sausage and kackwurst is shit
Another nice example is schwul (gay) and schwül (humid)
Perfectly shows that no, you can't just leave out the diacritics
Also in the same vein
Schweißausbruch vs
Scheißausbruch
Schweißausbruch is a sudden sweat attack and Scheißausbruch is a sudden shit attack
Compared to others neighbours petrol and diesel is quite "cheap"

Lol here you barely get 100 Mbit/s for 46€
don't worry he has his own
I have 125mbit for 32€ and could get 500mbit or even gigabit if I wanted
Time for a new contract
I pay less than 20 € for 30GB in Austria, can't imagine the German situation is much different
I love them
I was always so excited as a child when there was a thunderstorm and the electricity stopped working
Or when there were heavy summer rains and I could run into the garden and run around in them
So good
I love thunderstorms
Get a cup of tea
Sit under a roof outside and just watch the show
Lmao if you dont come out sabina will come inside

Lmao if you dont come out, sabina will come inside
I like mine better
Now it doesnt happen anymore, but 25 years ago it was normal to have balck-outs
Strong winds could already cause that
I think "foret noire" or "Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte" is of German origin
At least its namegiver is located in Germany
Yup, exact same thing
I like to do that with idioms
A common sentence if you want to rudely tell someone to leave:
> Hau dich ueber die Haeuser
would translate to
> Throw yourself over the houses
But my favorite is translating
> I'm in a pickle
word for word into German

According to kill count: Ticks, wasps & company, parasites, dogs, cows
According to "oh shit that big-ass animal is way too close": wolves (very few though), bears (hardly any), boars, rats, cows
I guess theoretically a lynx could kill a human, but they are so shy, they can go around undetected by anybody for years
I would say a wild boar with piglets
Wouldn´t want to mess with them
Of course, we have bears too, but the likelyhood of actually getting in contact with one is near zero and if you do, they will most likely back off and run away
But I wouldn´t want to have an encounter with a wild boar in the forest
They could really fuck you up big time
Other than that (yeah, ticks may be dangerous too, when you are being infected with FSME, but there is a vaccine for that) we don´t really have dangerous animals here
There might be some very rare snakes (sand viper) in some parts of Austria, but the likelyhood of ever meeting one of them is practically zero
You do have a lot of bears in Slovenia, but have you had any serious incidents in the last years
People here are afraid when a bear is spotted
There are probably one or two bears in the whole country
At the same time, i know several people in my area who got heavily injured by boars, one even died
There's wolves that far west
numbers and proximity to humans
Tigers generally avoid humans while snakes feed on animals that live near humans like mice, rats, etc
Thank you, very interesting
I will keep it in mind next time i visit
Yeah but biologically the Iberian peninsula is almost its own thing
It's separated from the rest of western europe by the pyrenees
Same goes for the Italian peninsula
Also, Iberia is very empty, so wolves are less of a surprise there
But Belgium is such densely settled country, I thought that was kinda surprising
i don't have the numbers - and they may vary a lot for different regions - but it's possible for some regions
I'm rather sure it's not the case here but maybe somewhere else, where there are virtually no deaths caused by other animals :D
In Austria the draft is (still) mandatory so I spent 2 months near the hungarian boarder
One week in one of my colleagues decides it would be a great idea to shoot towards Hungary
The next week someone else accidentally set a car on fire
It was a strange time
You've just reminded me: I think my unit accidentally invaded Slovenia at some point
We were on training in Carinthia and had the afternoon off
My unit leader wanted to show us the mountains and the setting of some intense battle between the Austrians and ~~- no idea - the Turks maybe
~~ Italians apparently
I don't know, but he went on and on about the tactics in the mountains
The thing is, the street we were on was the road to Slovenia, and our driver just drove without thinking (as is asked of you)
Then, we suddenly were in a tunnel, in our military vehicle, in full gear, rifle in hand INLCUDING BLANKS
Yeah, that was the tunnel that separated Austria and Slovenia
Needless to say we were a little on edge about what awaited us on the other end
We quickly turned around then
~~To my knowledge, we didn't cross a Slovenian border crossing yet, but we did cross the geographical border for sure
~~ Since we crossed the border, I think if you wanna be nitpicky we technically invaded
Edit: u/Big_Dirty_Piss_Boner has their facts straight
Thanks
>My unit leader wanted to show us the mountains and the setting of some intense battle between the Austrians and - no idea - the Turks maybe
I don't know, but he went on and on about the tactics in the mountains
I'd guess Italy in WWI
Nobody fought the Turks in the mountains
> To my knowledge, we didn't cross a Slovenian border crossing yet, but we did cross the geographical border for sure
I think if you wanna be nitpicky we technically invaded
There is no Slovenian border crossing
The only border crossing there is at the entrance of the tunnel on the Austrian side
When you are on the other side of the tunnel you are already in Slovenia
I am guessing you were in Bleiburg
I was stationed there for training for 8months (I think
) and there is a famous story there that some soldiers from Slovenia showed up at our barracks
Since most of the people ther spoke Slovenian they quickly found out that they went on a march and got lost in the mountains and somehow ended up here
They just told them the way back so no big fight or anything but I guess u guys paid them back
We had a few disputes with the turks, but those were ~500 years before WWI
Could have been both
The Ottoman empire was a transcontinental empire controlling most of southeastern Europe, Northern Africa and Western Asia
They had wars with European countries from mid 14th century until 1913
Wow, I'm used to all my pro-EU subs so much by now that I was extremely surprised by mostly neutral and some negative answers
Also I knew that in some countries it was very uncommon to show flags or nationslity openly (such as my own), but I never would have thought them to be so many and that the Netherlands would be the exception
I hope our countries will soon be ready to celebrate europe day
There are pushes for it here and there, although small
The 9th May is Europe day
I honestly wouldn’t have known
Also no
Never seen the EU flag on any private property, actually only on state buildings in Vienna for certain occasions
No, its not common in Austria
I think most people have never even heard of Europe Day (what a shame) or are aware that the day before Europe Day is the day the nazis capitulated and may be considered a holiday (even greater shame for this country)
I personally fly the flag on 8th and 9th May
Flying Flags really isn't a thing around here, so hardly anyone has a flagpole to fly one
Some older condo complexes have masts that fly flags on 1st of may (Social Democrats) and on 26th of October (national holiday)
Before I moved in together with my wife I sometimes put an EU flag on my balcony
But as my wife does not like flag flying and has hidden the flag, I doubt I ll do it this year
oh wow that's funny to read
one of the fucking best flags imho, colors, design, what it stands for
personally I would take that flag over any other any day
boring he says, haha
However i just remembered after reading another comment that the tramways in Vienna have little european flags on them in the first weeks of may in celebration of these days
But as i said above most people have no clue why
The usually fly them all year round tho
Nothing special for Europe Day
Francos Spain ironically enough fell so fast because the monarch Franco wanted on the throne also supported a democratic spain and made full efforts to transition to democracy asap
It's not like the Ussr's satellite states had not tried to break away either both czechoslovakia and hungary had revolutions that were brutally put down by the soviets

If people try to tell you you should watch Muttertag - it's a classic, but the migrumpies are waay better and waay less dependent on your ability to understand the Austrian dialect

I'd replace Kurz with Sanna Marin instantly
Nobody needs this slimy wannabe-Orbán.
And she is hella smart
Finished school with the best possible grades and obtained a PhD in quantum chemistry
Isn’t the queen technically also German
next you will tell me you also like trump
Well, yes
I only made the comment because the first argument of OP was a German stereotype
However, we are talking about nobility - whose whole right of existence is based on their ancestry
I love my language and especially my dialect
It just sounds like home
When you hear somebody speak it in an other part of Austria or in general hearing German
It is just like yes I know where you are from
And to oftwn you actually know them, or have at least seen them
I love the thing with the nouns everyone mentions
But also our direct words, like Flugzeug (Fly-thing,plane), Spielzeug (playing-things), Brustwarze ( breast-wart, nipple), there are more but I can't think of any
Also I love the "ch"  and "sch" sounds ( yes I like the way swiss people say it I like the soft "ch")
I certainly have more things but it is late and I am tired
I love how Austrian German can sound very nice and harmless, while being really graphic
Also, it's really versatile and expresses a lot with the melody of a sentence
For Austria you know what I‘m boutta say: the dialects
We have such a wide variety of dialects, I googled how many and according to studies there are too many to count them
And sometimes not even Austrians understand the dialect of another Austrian
It‘s really interesting imo
Also it seems like Germans are suckers for Austrian dialects or are at leats really interested in them
And other than that, I just like (Austrian-)German itself because you can always make up new words by just taking other words and sticking them together
There‘s no limit
(E.g. the german word for towel is Handtuch - hand cloth
Then there‘s Handtuchhalter - hand cloth holder and it could go on and on
) Also how ridiculous some words sound, because everything is literally
Plane - Flugzeug [fly thing], Toys - Spielzeug [play thing(s)], Clothes - Anziehsachen [put on things]
It‘s really funny
>and especially my dialect
It just sounds like home
Fuigas
Es is wirkli sche
In German we have a "silent h" which has a similar function
The hard thing when learning the language is to figure out which "h"s are silent and which are not
Oh man we got way too many offal recipes
Beuschl (upper innards, or specifically lung), Hirn mit Ei (brain with scrambled eggs), Kutteln (tripe - i.e. cow stomach), ...
Not very common, but my great-grandmother had this recipe, which is still getting used:
It's basically pancakes stacked on top of each other with ketchup and meat (not like, steak, but "minced" meat, had to google what it's in english) between the pancakes
Suler yummy to me, disgusting to everyone I've told the recipe to
Bruckfleisch
It's really good though
I do that too
It's super good
Googled
Diaphragm ... ok, that's just a tough muscle, nothing wrong iwth that
But heart arteries
Seriously
That would freak me out too much
Idk, is liver considered disgusting
It tastes way too good for that
It is
You just have to get over the fact that it is brain
My little Brother loaded his Plate with it at a Buffet, ate 90% of it until we told him what it was :(
Said the person from a country where they put sugar into everything, including bread
tbf the inner and outer organs of common staple food animals (cattle, pigs, chicken, sheep) are eaten in most cultures
It's part of using the whole animals and all
I once ate a great Beuschl-like dish in Rome, it had a different name, but essentially it was the same parts
Only in the last decades that got somewhat lost
E.g. in Europe we don't eat pig's ears any more, they are sold as dog food
Or they are sold to China, where they are still eaten regularly in parts of the country
Because more and more people don't like those things, every year millions of tons of slaughter waste has to be thrown away
They look a bit like calamari, also the texture is similar
But yeah, Bruckfleisch definitely isn't for everyone
Never
It has been 9 years
I bet you can find those things also in the US in more rural areas with a tradition of cattle herding, like somewhere in the Midwest or Texas
I agree
Same in Austria
I sure do say oke
There's no y/i at the end
I think almost everybody says "oke" in austria while germans tend to say "okay"
I’d just show him a map and say “You fucked up
we still dont have south tyrol back
Someone from 1919 I think would be pretty amazed about how our country not only survived but prospered
Also he might be weirded out by the Sissi Hype
"There's gonna be ups and downs, not necessarily in that order"
Actually it got called 1st World War as soon as 1918
Let's warn him/her of Greater Serbian sentiment in a Yugoslav project
Maybe it takes
Let's make that after 1938
Timetraveller from 1919: "So we haven't united with Germany
:("
Me: "eeeh
lets just say it didn't work out"
Nah, this person would have lived it in the years after the assassination
They made commemorative Sisi *everything* in the aftermath and flooded souvenir shops in Austria and abroad
Statues and monuments were erected in the countries she often visited in her last years
Coincidentally, the first movie about Sisi (or her death, rather) was made in 1919, directed by her niece
It wasn't released until 1921, so our visitor wouldn't have seen it, but the cult of Sisi is definitely not a recent thing
The Romy Schneider Film was more of a culmination of everything that came before rather than a beginning of the hype
More like „No, but we are kinda united with most of Europe including Germany in some way
What
The internal cohesion of the SHS state suffered tremendously under the prevelance of a Serbia first mentality among a part of its population
That went to the point of parliamentarians assassinating each other over this nationalist mentality
Just ask Stepan Radic
That sentiment was even more pronounced under the 1928 royal dictatorship
Southslavism was severely threatened and almost by that
There's a prehistory of animosity to the Croatian collaboration with the Nazis you know
Tito and the communists revitalized the concept again
However as communist regimes do they coupled it with the man on the top and the ideology and when Tito croaked the Serbian primacy in the federation again became too noticeable and spured much animosity
The Serbian-Croat-Slovene state had quite a bit of negotiating power during the conference but did not get the full extent of their claims still
Ehhhhhh
There were still a load of Ukrainians in the Communist party as officials
The Russian party was of course the head honcho but the Ukrainians still had their place in it - especially in the administration of the Ukrainian SSR
Japanese democracy was heavily guided by the military and navy since the 1880s and alligned with their imperialistic whims
It was all a sham
Let's hope that Le Pen and her partygoes to way of Boulanger or Maurras and theirs
The way in which the Balkans was intermixed made sure that any solution based on ethnical nationstates would end in tragedy
Let's hope but it looks bleak - especially if it continues to go the way of Hungary
Im a historian xD Also helps that I love France
But all in all not very well known outside of specialist circles
You referring to Austria Hungary
Because even Yugoslavia was a nation state (in this case for the "yugoslavs")
In its selfclaimed goal the second Yugoslavia under Tito attempted an amalgation of the various constituent peoples into a single identity
Also being "Yugoslav" and being croatian, serbian, etc at the same time doesnt exclude one another as for example with Bavarians, Hannoveranians, etc all becoming "German"
The attempts to make the Yugoslav ethnos can be seen for example in the curriculum for learning BHS languages at school was unified and the language streamlined in order to create a situation similar to Italy where there was also a need to create an identity after the unficiation
So to put it more succinctly Yugoslavia was a "multinational" state but oversaw the attempt to homogenize the southern slavic peoples into one ethnos
The eastern Adriatic coastline
Especially the time when it was the border between the Ottoman Empire, Venice, Austria and the Italian principalities
The Republic of Ragusa comes to mind
Somewhat of a wild maritime borderzone in the backyard, including everything from Island fortresses to pirates
I didn‘t even know that Austria actually invaded Poland during (or after
) WW1 and that my moms family had to change their last name to something more „Austrian“ to get money or something like that (I think that‘s how I remember the story)
I don’t know about the rest of Austria, but I can speak of Vienna through the eyes of an urban planning student
There are quite a few urban renewal areas that boast impressive modern architecture like Sonnwendviertel/Wien Hbf, Nordbahnviertel, Eurogate, Viertel Zwei/WU University, Kaisermühlen (arguably older), or even smaller areas like Ensemble or star22
However, the most jaw-dropping area has to be the Seestadt Aspern
It‘s basically a whole new large-scale urban neighborhood being built on the outskirts of Vienna and is supposed to be able to function independently from the rest of the city
While it doesn’t really have any skyscrapers, it focuses on vibrant architecture and public spaces, so you pretty much always have some kind of streetlife over there
As for my hometown of Timișoara, Romania, you have Iulius Town, City Business Center and ISHO as the most modern areas in the city
If you’re interested in modern architecture and planning, I suggest you visit any of these places
As a whole complex, the business university WU Wien
It's because we usually add new buildings to really old ones, but this was built new from the ground up, so it all looks really modern
I'd add the DC Tower to that list
And the [WU Campus] Has been used as a backdrop in quite a few Sci-fi-movies already
I‘m studying it in Vienna at the Technical University (TU Wien)
It’s called Spatial Planning/Raumplanung here, so you’d also study other aspects of planning like regional or traffic planning
If you‘re coming from Eastern Europe, then yes, it‘s a perfectly decent university to study planning at
However, since I‘m almost finishing my degree, I suggest you do some broader research and find out what other universities in the west have to offer
In this field it‘s always important to have your study input up-to-date and to keep it international, which hasn‘t always been the case at TU
On the bright side, apart from knowing German, you have no admission requirements whatsoever here
Wish you best of luck in pursuing a planning career
came here for this
Towns with the name [Öd] in Austria and Bavaria literally meaning ~"dull".
We are full of short place names like au (vorarlberg)
But some big citys have short names too wien (vienna), graz, Linz, ...
Many places called Au, translates to meadow
Au is also used as an addition to places e.g. Eckartau, Ramsau, Schwendau
In my valley alone there are hundreds of Aus
Same in Austria
And we have a few "Oed", too
We also have an Au
wanted to comment the same lol
The unigoat looks rightfully pissed off at being endangered
Baggins was translated to Beutlin here (Beutel means bag or sachet)
There was a huge outcry at the new translation of A song if Ice and Fire ten years ago
They translated some surenames and place names to German
Imho that was weird but some names sound funny at the first time but they didn't translated it literally and sometimes it sounded really like a medieval German place and sometimes odd
A odd example would be Kings landing which was translated to Königsmund (literally kings mouth)
If you think about the name you realise it's meant the mouth of the river it's located, but it's odd nonetheless
A more petty example would be Casterly Rock to Casterly Stein
The arguments were that Rock should be literally translated to "Fels" which sounds stronger
But imho that's petty because "Stein" is a common name part of mountain/hill castle in real life
Edit:
I nearly forgot, Lord of the Rings got a new translation too (well that was a biiiit
longer ago) and there the Hobbits use colloquial speech, like calling Frodo "Chef".
The feelings about it were very mixed
As far as I remember in the old translation the Hobbits speak to "clean" compared to the English version but the new one sounded to modern
> The feelings about it were very mixed
As far as I remember in the old translation the Hobbits speak to "clean" compared to the English version but the new one sounded to modern
Oh you mean the first translation of Margaret Carroux (prose) and Ebba von Freymann (for the poems) with the help of Tolkien himself VS
the second translation by Wolfgang Krege
I read the first two parts in the former translation, the third in the latter
I thought Carroux and Freymann did a fantastic job, especially with the translation of all the names and the songs and poems
However the direct interactions of the characters seem a bit
distant
In Krege's translation that is not the case, direct interaction are much more lively and nuanced
However it feels a bit over the top in its try to "modernize" the speech of certain characters (the young Hobbits in particular)
When I first read it in English I was surprised about the emotional depth of e.g. Gandalfs speech, which appeared way colder and more "biblical" in the original German translation
Isn't “reppuli” dangerously close to “ripuli”?
Funfact: Kamehameha was the name of several kings of the Kingdom of Hawai'i before it was colonized and annexed by the US in 1898

Holy fuck, just put a major spoiler in the title
Way to go
> Lock Up - Stallone Prisioneiro (Inmate Stallone)
Now I know Sylvester Stallone isn't exactly a world class actor with a huge range, but that's just lazy
>I guess it's less weird when you're from a coastal region where such names aren't uncommon
It also isn't uncommon in other regions, because places were rivers join each other are often called Gemünd, Gemünden or Gmünd
Yeah, but most people didn't think that far, e.g mouth of the king
What does that even mean
And there was a circle jerk of the translation beeing extreme bad
Imho they did good that the translation sound oldtimey German
It was a bit unnecessary though as there was already an old one whete the kept the place and people names
> An Elfe is more like a pixie in german while an Elb sounds a bit more majestic
Tolkien himself was behind that particular translation
He had the opinion that German "Elf(e)" is a loanword from English "elf", while "Elb" is closer to the "original" Germanic "Alb" (e.g. Albtraum), which makes it sound more authentic in German
Jössas
Von da kommt Gmunden
Thanks for that insight
Ah okay makes sense
I thought it was their regal name, but now that I think of it, I guess Hawai'ian (regal) naming customs differ from European ones
and for districts in the state Salzburg
Churches have burned down during the war as well, and were rebuilt
And I assume (and hope) that France will do the same with Notre Dame
Yes, it is a hard hit, but it does not have to be the end
I sympathize with the French people to whom this must be devastating, but I personally feel no greater connection to it
Yes, Notre Dame is amongst the most famous, but Europe as a whole has more than enough giant stone cathedrals left
First and foremost, I think we should be relieved no human lives have been lost (so far)
this is incredibly sad
and of course fucking idiots on the news subs are using this to push their racist agenda wtf
I think everybody who appreciates Art ans Architecture feels sad for the loss
I certainly do
I feel no connection whatsoever
It will probably be renovated anyway, so i don't get what all the fuss is about
Not a really fun-fact: today, 74 years ago St
Stephen's cathedral in Vienna was on fire as well
Let's put it this way, I would certainly feel *more* devastated if St
Stephen's in Vienna burned down, but man, not by much
This is horrible
Just thinking about all the love, devotion and work that was put into this building over the years makes me tear up a bit
[St Stephens Cathedral 1945] \- whole album on[this site upper right] corner has an awesome [new roof now]
i second that
Islamist terrorism against a Christian monument
It's quite obvious really
Yes it's absolutely fucking ridiculous, but that never stopped anyone to make uninformed bullshit statements, right
In Vienna, if correcting a neighbor's behavior absolutely *has* to be verbal, then it at least needs to be yelled out of an open window or down from a balcony
Imo, there are a lot of these small cultural details that are shared by "germanic" countries (scandinavia, DACH, maybe netherlands and iceland)
In Swedish, they are called "arg lapp" ('angry note')
Yes, only less German and more Austrian ;)
Luxembourgish doesn't really fit into that group
It's part of the West Central German group, and thus part of the High/Upper German family
Personally, I can understand it about as easily as an Alemannic dialect (Swiss or whatever), which is to say: I have to concentrate, but it's not all too different
All the others are not High German
Flemish is a closely related dialect of Dutch, Afrikaans is a colonial variation of Dutch, and AFAIK relatively intellegible
All three ultimately derive from Old Lower Frankonian
Frisian is completely its own thing, derives from Old Frisian, and Low German derives from Old Saxon
Those two and English + Scots and derivates are usually grouped together as "North Sea Germanic".
I can't really understand any of the latter ones
They sound familiar, and I get some bits and pieces, but overall I can't understand it
Luxembourgish sounds like a quirky German dialect
Iirc it is
Flemish is Dutch
And I understand Dutch good enough to get a rough sense of what a short text is about
Frisian seems a bit easier
Afrikaans on the other hand seems way harder than Dutch
> It refers to the dialects spoken in Flanders
The official language is just Dutch
Thus: a dialect of Dutch

So what is it then
-Herbert Prohaska
That's because you've been to Tyrol
That's not standard austrian german we speak here
You've probably either been to the Zillertal, Ötztal or Paznaun
Which are each known for their particularly different dialects
Yes
But doesn't it sound slightly different to Dutch Dutch
Because that is what I have been told
Yes
And American English is a group of dialects within the English language
Obviously
Saying "Flemish is a dialect of  Dutch" is of course as much hyperbole as saying "Austrian German is a dialect of German" (it's actually 2, 4, 9, or a few dozen, depending how you wanna count it), just as the word "dialect" is not very precise (for the same reason)
But that doesn't make the core of the argument wrong
Sorry, can't help you there
Vienna is definitely disliked by non-Vienna
Not for being a dirty crime-ridden hellhole (it clearly isn't), but for being snotty bullies who lord it over everybody else
For a country this size Vienna is rather large
Its a time honored tradition to hate the capital
Austria
Vienna is amazing
I personally don't dislike vienna, but I think most people do
I mean Vienna is also hated for being a dirty crime-ridden hellhole
Even though it absolutely is not
But non-Viennese Austrians (even some Viennese Austrians) seem to believe it is, because certain people tell them so
Nonsense
I'm Tyroleaan and I love Vienna and the Viennese
What a a shitty reply in a shitty thread
Being snotty bullies is something you also encountet in the more rural parts of the country
The way some farmers treat "Häuslleut" is more akin to nobles treating their lessers than anything else
but you must admit that it *is* a thing to hate on the Viennese
mostly it's done by a certain kind of people that have
very strong ties to their local community, let's put it like that, but it's everywhere and I would even say it's what the majority thinks: complaining about their drivers when you see a W on the car sign in front of you, complaining about their noisy and presumptuous tourists, about the politics, etc
etc
I know lots of Spanish people who think Barcelona has become too overcrowded recently, and prefer Madrid becasue of that

He probably didn't, but half of Austria did in Celebration of the government collapsing
If I recall correctly there even was a concert of the vengaboys in front of the federal chancellery
If you count English, yes that's the expected standard
Since we have English classes from elementary school up, and English is one of the subjects you must graduate in, I'd say yes, especially for everyone under 40-50
In Austria you learn it in school if you want or not
It's not an explicit taboo, but as I would me never ever came into my mind looking into some people fridges i guess it's an indirect one
I honestly have trouble wrapping my head around this concept
what are they hoping to find
I mean unless it's an event where getting food is specified, like a party where there's beer in the fridge or an evening where I invited them over to dinner and asked them to get something or help themselves
but if they're just dropping by
Have fun suckling mustard out the tube I guess
There's also butter probably, and milk
Enjoy
Dude, we're right here
Germany: i love their straight-forward-no bullshit-get to the point-mentality
Also their cars and general technical expertise
Switzerland: I love their language
Schwyzerdütsch is just a gem
Also their sense for democracy, how intensely they partake in the political decision making
Italy: the food, the way of life and how they celebrate all things good about living, the cars and motorbikes (yes, these too, and for entirely different reasons than the German ones)
Slovenia|Hungary|Czechia|Slovakia: honestly, since we share so much of our history with them as one people, they seem so similar to us that i can only say, it's a bit like home (and reminds me of all things good
Liechtenstein: sorry guys, I've only ever met one of you peops back when we were both studying and he was very nice but the cliche was just ridiculously strong with him: 19 years old with a gold watch and a S-class Merc each worth more than a year's salary of mine (now, more than a decade into working life)
Not exactly neighbours, but close enough:
Croatians are chill af
I love the Italian love for kids
Even when you don’t have any kids your own, you just have to recognize that
Kids running around making noise
No problem
The elders don’t complain but instead will interact with the kids in a fun way and enjoy their time with them
It’s really like „the whole village raises the kids“. Seriously, Italy is awesome when it comes to this
Austria is sooooo different in this case
You forgot a bordering country ;)
as Eastern Austrian, I wish

A technical device is easy to break down into what it's made of/for and what it does well/not so well

Yes there were rules, but I don't know exactly what they are
What I know though is that they basically check if that name has been given to someone before in Austria
If it has it's no problem
If it hasn't then you need to get approval and basically prove that it's a proper name
Funfact: changing your name afterwards is easier and allows for more freedom
Friend of mine had trouble with his son's name and seriously considered to just name him some standard Austrian name and then rename him the next day

Kunsthistorisches (Kunst = Art, historisches = history), Naturhistorisches (Nature), technisches (technical) Museum

I've been there with school
It was amazing
I'll never forget the motherfucking [FIRE TORNADO]
Also, I learned the fastest way to empty a full bottle is by twisting and creating a vortex in the liquid
That way there's a constant stream of water outside, while air can get inside in the middle
That comes in handy on a regular basis
Yes
The only other language my parents knew was english so they used that
I'm learning a few less common languages so maybe I'll be able to use something more obscure once I have kids :)
This only works for regions like yours because there it is the standard to speak more than one language
Try Altkirchenslawisch (old church slavonic)
I feel like I'm not going to find that on Duolingo
Now I'm curious what language they speak though
Yes of course
Most people speak at least English here but I’ve never actually heard of someone speaking in a different language so that their child doesn’t understand
What I meant is that for you it’s only natural to speak French besides Flemish, however here in Austria English is not a language people speak here besides German
I worked for some years in tourism - I always liked helping people learning German
But there is one thing that annoyed the absolute crap out of me and every colleague - don't go to people and just greet somebody in their native language
Like going to the ticket counter saying 'Guten Tag
' and nothing more because the polite thing for me is then to answer in normal German but then I have to realize you don't speak (normal) German and everything gets complicated
When approaching people and you don't know the language and you still want to greet in the local language, say a full sentence like 'Guten Tag, I would like to buy some tickets'. And if you are learning German and you want people to talk German to you, then say a whole sentence so we can hear on which level of German you are and react accordingly
My experience in Paris was that most people ignored my French, that was obviously enough to make myself understood and have a conversation, and just replied in English
It was often a bit weird because they let me feel that my French was not good enough . At some point I just stopped trying
I always forget that German is very common among the older generation there, I feel so weird when going on holidays to Croatia and, after me asking nicely in English, they answer in absolutely flawless German
No hard feelings
The country is still spectacular and I know plenty of very friendly French people
Just not from Paris for some reason
Like a cafè/coffee house
The moment you cross the border you get overwhelmed with smells of coffee beans and different cakes and pastries
Or like cigarettes
Schnitzel of course, or the smell of forest and mountain air
Comes down to your preference
Cake, coffee, cigarettes and jagertee or some sort of herbal liquor, because whether you are in the country, I'm pretty sure you will find a place that smells like that
the smell of freshly baked dark bread or a glass of milk directly from the cow
I'd say a mix of expensive parfum, coffee and old curtains in a smokers room
Wait am I just describing a typical Austrian café?!?
And cinnamon
I mistook your flag for a millisecond for an Austrian one and was thinking „What the hell are they talking about
“ when I realized my mistake
Those smells do seem nice
That's a good description, immediately had the smell in my brain
But do you mean the new smell of Railjet, Cityjet, Talent or the old smell of CityShuttle and InterCities
Because I think the differ
Since austria is austria and the countriside shits on everything vienna says if it thinks it is stupid it is somewhat legal in some places
In the sense that you could smoke it next to the police and they wouldn't care
My area is such an area and we have way more problems with drunk people (yes we have way more drunk people compared to high people but still, high people never make problems)
I mean alcohol is way more dangerous and my village would march against vienna if they would try to enforce some sort of alcohol ban so why not legalize canabis
It should be legalized but controlled - i.e. only sold above 18 and in specialized stores
neutral, but I guess legalising it would bring more advantages than disadvantages
Legalized, but with restrictions (age limit and amout per person per month or something similar)
Yes, society and state would benefit from a legalization
The taxes from the sales would create a lot of money which are needed for budgets like health care, education and pension
It would lower the illegal sales and get rid of shady dealers in public parks etc
Maybe there will be an increase in people smoking weed at first, but IMO the effect of curiosity would lay off quickly and people realize the intoxication is very similar to 'common', legal drugs
It would enlighten a lot of (especially older) people
People panicking about teens celebrating 420 everyday forget that this is true for every substance/matter witch is forbidden
Alcohol here is legal at the age of 16, but everyone I know had tried it once at an earlier age (~14y)
Same is true for cigarettes and coffee
When we were old enough to drink, we drank a lot, often way too much, but in the end only you can decide if it's too much for you and how to regulate it
If it's legal or not doesn't matter in this question
And yes, my circle of friends had also people who didn't drink or smoke
The key to drugs is to regulate the usage
If you fall behind on school or get fucked up before work, that's definitely abuse and should be changed
The thing is you can get addicted to everything (sugar, cigarettes, Alcohol, pills, fat/fast food, sports
even working your ass off), but labelling things illegal won't stop people from abusing it
Of course a legalization is bound to restrict the use similar to alcohol usage (forbitten until age of X, no intoxication while driving/work, only sold in special places etc
I guess in Austria it would be sold in pharmacies
Nowadays you can get e recipe for it, but it's very hard to get one and you have to buy it from the pharmacy for 10x the usual price
Me too
They don't care as long as you're looking "Austrian".
If not they're cracking down before you can say Kasperl
Yeah but since the countryside blames everything ether on germans, hungarians, poles or on vienna there will not be a lot for vienna to march on
I mean you can hardly blame the first 3 for it and i garantie you that the city will burn if that happenes
Its really funny if you look back a hundred years
Back then the countryside blamed the Jews and Vienna for everything
The state could have a monopoly or only allow special, licensed shops (like it's for cigarettes here)
Also: Madagascar is not somewhere close the poles
And Tunisia is not in Asia
germany is in central europe, look at the times zones
you phrased it like a fact
> and we don't even use that one much
Omg thank you

A friend of mine said the central heating/boiler room of the asylum he worked for was always creepy
Well it was used as crematory in darker times, so may he is onto something
The former concentration camp in Mauthausen feels very creepy, for obvious reasons
It's a big memorial, and a lot of it is still in shape, more or less as it used to be
Another spot is [this big hole in Vienna] were the Wienfluss exits its underground bed in the very extensive canalization of Vienna and then continues to openly flow through a park and into the Danube Canal
I always imagine if you follow the river upstream, into the hole, you'll get lost and never get out again
The Netflix series "Freud" (watch it, it's cool) picked up on that spookiness and included it in the show
As a matter of fact, around the year 1900, [a lot of people actually lived down there]
The fact, that im basically living on a 1000 years old graveyard, but thats only for my village
Fellow viennese here, I saw this hole before but never thought nuch about it, this is so interesting
Do you have any more resources/links on this

How does one even determine what most haunted forest in the world is
It's not like you can take a ghost census
Oh da gibts in Linz auch einen ganzen Haufen
Unterm Bauernberg
[Other than wikipedia about the river] no, but i heard there's a great guided tour through the canalisation, the "3rd Man Tour" check it out
It starts on Karlsplatz
Also the 1950s Hollywood classic "The 3rd Man" was shot down there, great film
Under normal circumstances they play it once a week in Burgkino
Well, yes
But what with the blood covered sheets and the transparency and the lack of proper address, how do you know you haven't counted most of them twice
What if the most haunted forest in the world is just a single ghost having a lark with the census takers
yes, in dialect you can make whole sentences with it (mostly due to the common dropping of "ch")
"A e i a!" would mean "Oh so me too actually
Austrian-German has a few abbreviated words:
\- i ("ich") meaning "me"
\- a ("auch") meaning "also"
\- e (no real german translation, similar to "ohnehin") meaning something like "anyway", but not exactly
&#x200B;
You can construct a whole sentence with those: "A i e a", meaning something like "Is that so
Me too, by the way
The first "A" is a different comment advert
There actually is a one letter word, "[o]  used in Standard German but it is kind of [archaic] As an interjection it is also mostly used in combination with a second word
Examples, according to Duden (online version) can be:
* "o weh
" (= "oh dear")
* "o Gott
" (= "oh god")
Another example from [Matthäus-Passion] (J. S. Bach) as used in Wolf Haas' "Komm, süßer Tod" (sorry, couldn't resist) as "o" is often used in an ecclesiastical context
* "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden, voll Schmerz und voller Hohn,o Haupt, zu Spott gebunden, mit einer Dornenkron"
(= "o head full of blood and wounds, full of pain and scorn, oh head, bound to mockery, with a crown of thorns")
&#x200B;
EDIT: changed a word in the translation
a - too
i - me/I
I a - Mee too
Standard German itself doesn't have any that I could think of right now
In Austrian dialects though there's
i (short for "ich") which is "I" in English
a (short for "ein" or "auch") which is "a" or "too" in English
Edit: We also abbreviate other words, like "das" ("the") with s, but it doesn't appear without a noun that it's used with so idk if that counts
We do, but just in dialects
"I" being short for ich/I, "a" meaning "auch"/too, "ein"/a

I personnaly believe salaries must be transparent
I would like to know what I need to do to get X or at least why do I get Y right now
Knowing the salaries of people who works longer in the company or higher in hierarchy would help me understand, if it makes sense to stay in the company
It is but we should normalize talking about it openly
It really depends who you are talking to
If you are not exactly friends with someone, it may be inappropriate asking how much they make, or telling them how much you make
It’s not really a thing people talk a lot about
If one of my friends got a new job I do ask them how much they make, but I can’t imagine asking for instance my uncle or my godfather how much he makes
Older generations won't talk about it
Younger ones do
And it helps everyone
Nobody usually talks about it
Maybe if you just got a job (especially when you get your first job) then somebody might ask you „And how much do you get
“ but otherwise nobody really talk/brags/complains about their wages
When a coworker in a similar position asks about your wage, would you still consider it rude
I never find people talking about their wages in my branche which makes me clueless about how much I should be earning and it sucks
Guess it makes companies' lives easier and fills their purse because no one wants to talk about it
Wages are only one part of financial situation
And being open about your salary is generally a good thing since it introduces more transparency into the system
[Sung to the tune of Battle hymn of the Republic]
When the union's inspiration through the workers' blood shall run,
There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun;
Yet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one,

So you have no idea at all if your salary is decent or not

Interesting thread and question, thanks
I think that green ones are more common, the most popular type being either filled or unfilled green olives with sour brine sold in glasses
Personally, I prefer black olives since they are often more salty than sour
Source: personal observation
Green by far, I like both but prefer black ones on my pizza
And the french wanted icbms hence the ariane program
I think it's definitely better than going full presidential
That was a very interesting read, thank you so much for going into all this detail
I remember I downloaded belarussian for google translate when I went there and when I was there people told me no one speaks that
> Pretty much everyone who speaks Welsh as their first language can speak English fluently from a relatively young age
Welsh is compulsory in English medium schools and English is compulsory in Welsh medium schools (although the standard of Welsh in English medium schools is lower than the standard of English at Welsh medium schools)
Those who go to English medium schools have to learn Welsh pretty much from the start of education until the age of 16 but many leave still not being able to speak anything beyond the very basics
According to my gf this is very similar in the Basque country
> Once you go further from primary education it starts decreasing as your studies improve
That really depends on the area of studies though
My gf's sister studied medicine entirely in Basque
In my gf's very very Basque home village (i.e. almost everybody speaks Basque all the time, all the Spanish road signs are graffitied over, the parade of the 3 Reyes Magos has been chased out of town with stones once because the tradition is "too Spanish", the government-mandated Spanish flag on city hall is about the size of a sheet of toilet paper etc
) there's a street vendor from Senegal who speaks very broken and bad Spanish, but is incredibly fluent in Basque
He is very well-known and popular in the village, because he's a very open and extroverted guy, so I guess that helps
They also have lots of [Sahrawi] immigrants/refugees, who speak ofc Arabic, good enough Basque and a little Spanish
Latinos usually stick mostly with Spanish (which arguably sounds way more eloquent than Castillian Spanish), but know enough Basque to get by
Their kids learn Basuqe in school ofc, but that doesn't mean that they really speak it
I guess it's a little bit like the situation in Wales in that respect
AFAIK most latino kids go to Catholic schools, that tend to be Spanish-only, with a single Basque language course
However most Latinos live in more industrialized areas anyway, where there's also more working-class people from Spain proper, who came to the Basque Country in the 60s and 70s and never really bothered to learn Basque (also bc it was illegal to teach the language until the 70s)
Nowadays, unless you want to work for the Basque government (i.e. govt official, health care, education, judicial system etc
), you can get by without any Basque just fine
When I'm there I speak Spanish because all my Basque is used up after 2 sentences
My gf's cousins always joke that it's crazy that I speak better Spanish than them, even though they've grown up there
The thing is, they go months without using Spanish at all (they are some very rural, salt of the earth dudes who hardly ever visit the city and are happy spending all their time in the village, on the pasture, or in the woods, I guess in the US you'd call them hillbillies), whereas I use Spanish on a daily basis
Yeah, let's just Habsburg 'em and make them speak German
> German is somewhat less used and more rare, at least in the center-south of the country
I know in the north is a bit different
Tbf most German dialects and Luxembourgish are pretty much mutually intelligbile, right
I can read it well enough at least, and I think after 5 minutes of immersion I could also understand it well enough

Haha, the Luxemburger community in Vienna is awesome
Immediately made me think of the best parties as a student
> The Romance languages once where all a language continuum
You could argue that they still are
What about Occitan or Provencal
Yes
If it's a longer way they take the bus
It's a normal bus for everyone not a special school bus
Yes, at least Here in rural place and in Graz
but many people also Take them by Car To school
It's totally normal for kids at around 6 years to walk to school or take public transport
In Western part of Austria Vorarlberg, where my relatives live, even kindergardeners walk there by themselves
That won't work the more East you go in Austria and in Vienna the Kindergarden needs a picture and name of the people allowed to pick up a kid
So if grandma or uncle comes for a visit and wants to pick up someone, parents have to send in the information beforehand
native German; didn't understand one thing
Yeah exactly
Speaking German definitely helps u understanding this
When influencers talk about a photo shoot in English they often call "a shooting" because for some reason we decided to incorrectly incorporate that word into our language
"To get" means "bekommen" in German, so a lot of the time people confuse that with "to become". Very popular mistake in English class is "I became money for my birthday"
I think mother language for native language, because Muttersprache (native language) in German literally translated is Mother language, and if you don‘t know an English word you can just translate the German one literally and sometimes it‘s correct
Or Handy
Everybody gets taught to _not_ use Handy for cell phone
I think if handy is used as a noun and not as an adjective in Britain it could mean Handjob, if I‘m correct
Would be nice if a brit could tell me wether I‘m talking nonsense or not
Generally in German we make everything, we don‘t do
Same in German
Someone being funny and something being fun is described with the same adjective "lustig"
Yup
Same goes for Germans ofc
Handy is the most used word for cell phone, yes
Ofc there‘s Smartphone or Telefon (telephone), but Handy is the most used (aka used by everyone)
Saying "Sinn machen" or "das macht Sinn" is totally normal in Austria, I think germans use "Sinn ergeben" more than us
"Sinn machen" is perfectly fine in Austrian German at least
I‘m not that good at german dialects
I don‘t think so
In English, you can _do_ people (in a sexual way), but if you say that in German it sounds weird af
Except if making a baby counts, because then yes, you can make people
Macht Sinn
I would (in my Austrian German ofc, Idk if it‘s the same in Standard German) say „Ich habe gemacht, dass er das gemacht hat“ which is basically translated „I made, that he made something“
–> So you make people make something
(I‘ve never noticed how weird that sounds up until now)
That works in Standard and Austrian German too
well my mother is from chile, and when i was younger our school sent us out for red nose day(which is collecting money for sick childrens clown, cuz that helps) and i went to  nun to collect a bit of money and she already looked latin to me and i asked her for money for sick children and she responded in more or less spanish that she doesnt speak german, so i asked her in spanish where she was from and she said "De Chile po
" which is a very chilean way to say that you are from chile
that made my whole day because the nun was so happy to meet a chilean in austria
2 years ago I was visiting Paris with my mother
Our visit also included Disneyland (yes 20 year old me insisted)
Around noon the restaurants began to fill up
Predicting this we went there a bit earlier
By the time we were finished with our food the restaurant was flooded with little kids and their parents
Across the room was a woman with a little girl who was desperatly looking for a seat
I waved at her and shouted "Hey Mam do you need a seat
" (Due to my parents having alot of american friends visiting I have a pretty american accent
) My mother followed up in normal volume with "Avez-vous besoin d'une table madame
". Relieved the woman thanked us with her best Merci and turned towards her daughter who was crying for food
She calmed her down with "Es dauert nicht mehr lange
Ich geh gleich Essen holen" (It won't take much longer
I will go to get food right away")
Me and my mum just smirked at each other and wished her a good day in German
We all laughed
That's bad
Not as bad as an Austrian local politician greeting our most well-known soccer player of the national team in english though
Seconds after greeting the other players in german
[And yepp, Alaba has dark skin]
Normally it's the other way round

What I actually wanted to ask was why do you, and apparently several others speak German
[Yes it does, but almost nobody has one
Never seen an Austrian ID in real life before
[USA (Arkansas) ID Card]
Not Europe and also not my home country, but I've had a US ID card at some point
Some states have cards that contain the date you become 21 , so bouncers don't have to calculate your age
It also flips from horizontal to vertical at 21
I found that pretty neat
There is one here in Austria, but I've never even seen one
Reminds me of our old paper driving licenses
My mom still has one like that and it's still valid until 2033
I'm amazed it's still holding together
It's 35 years old and has been through the wash at least twice
yeah it's like that here
there is one, but nobody gets it - why should I pay another 50€ for something that I'd literally never use
if I go to the post office I use my driver's license or student id, if I go abroad I use my passport
ugh, same for driver's license here
I mean they switched to bank card format, but I still have the old foldable one that looks like a little pink book
The backside of the austrian one contains the follwing infos:
* Place of birth
* Nationality
* Hight
* Dates of issue and expiration
* issuing authority
The front side, as seen in the linked article, has
* Name including title
* date of birth
* sex
* signature and photo
I bought one after not being able to board a international bus and having forgot my passport
Super useful to have in your briefcase
"Almost nobody has one" is a bit of an exaggeration, nearly [10% of Austrians] actually have it
for me the most curious thing is that there's a space for two last names :)
ooh we will get that eventually, but it's still a few years out
nice to hear Pt is so far in adopting those e-government things
Passports have it too, was kinda funny when I had my height listed when I got my first passport as a kid and then kinda outgrew that number
;-)
haha, for some reason our pictures always look horrible as well
That makes sense
The ID costs the same as the passport and most people don't see the point in having both
If I didn't travel to the UK a lot I might have gotten an ID instead of renewing my passport
University: University ID (issued by the university)
Travel: Passport, not everyone only travels in Schengen (a very popular destination - Croatia - still is not part of the Schengen area) and a passport costs 75,90€ while an ID card costs 61,50€ (both vaild for 10 years)
> public exams, university exams,
As others said the university ID
But in general you would use your drivers license to ID yourself
The ID card is basically for people who don't have a drivers license
I personally don't understand why the standardized European driving license isn't recognized within the EU as an ID
Now that you mention it, ours is not fabric I think, but it does seem a lot sturdier than regular cardboard
Maybe it's similar to what they use for paper money
As far as I know, that's not a requirement in Austria
If asked by police or something, you do not need to have ID if you're a citizen, they'd just look you up in some national database
Also, to add to that: For general ID purposes in Austria (getting into clubs, buying alcohol), we mostly use our driver's licenses as (almost) everyone has one if they're over 18
Below that it is kind of messy, it's a weird mix of student's IDs, [e-Card] both, passports and the like for getting into clubs
Yes and no, it is a bit more nuanced than this - but in general yes, you won't be fined if you don't carry an ID document as a citizen
Otoh that makes it just more likely to be stolen
A friend of mine got an ID card though to be able to have something more widely accepted in the wallet
Sure you do, that's why people have a passport usually
Afair your birth/citizenship certificate (or documents created from that, such as a passport) + your positive proof that you finished high school ("Matura") and are allowed/able to study
You then get a unique ID number ("Matrikelnummer") from the first university you sign up at and a university ID card with this number, date of birth, name and picture in most cases
As these are issued by the university, they are not national IDs, but in practice they are likely enough to verify your age in a club or to maybe pick up a parcel (haven't tried it and my uni ID is expired by now)
Usually used for checking attendance at tests and to get student discounts
Passport, Birth certificate, certificate of citizenship etc
> What are those
(EHIC + some national stuff, used also to have the ability for a qualified digital signature)
insurance card, some functionality of an e-id was added later on, and was subsequently replaced by Handy-Signatur
the e-id part (and Handy-Signatur) is slated to be replaced by a proper eu-wide e-id though
the e-card was recently upgraded to include a picture to make misuse harder; sadly it's still not usable as proper id though, so that upgrade was kinda useless (and costly; thanks FPÖ)
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say without checking, that Vienna is the answer to all 4 years that have been asked
Most certainly when we consider Austria's current borders, and maybe also when we consider the respective historical borders
Not 100% sure on the latter though, Prague or Buda/Pest/Budapest might have been bigger at certain points in time since 1600, but I kind of doubt it
Now I'm waiting for some proud Czech/Hungarian user to correct /confirm me
I think at some points in the 1800s Vienna was even one of the top 10 biggest cities in the world (#1 being Beijing most of the time until 1900)
It really depends on what you count as "country".
If today's borders are applied when looking at the population in 1600, etc
it will always be Vienna
If we're looking at everything, including the HRE, Prague probably was bigger in 1600
1800 would be a toss-up between Vienna and Berlin with Vienna probably being bigger
It's not all that easy finding reliable numbers for population like that
Well, is this post about present day borders, or about any historical borders that include ones country
I could think of Vienna, if the second one is the case
I have never heard the Slovenian name for Trieste, but it seems fitting that you just took all the vowels, removed them and called it a day
I looked it up, around 1600 Prague had ~60
000 while Vienna had ~50
000
ETA: In 1800, it was already 270
000 in Vienna compared to 70
000 in Prague
Is the name Gradec still in use in Slovenia
Haha I'm so sorry, I removed the BCS a few seconds after I wrote it but you still caught it
I should have realized my oversight sooner by spelling it all out though :)
[In reading up about it I learnt] something new about the relationships between the Southern Slavic languages which was terribly interesting, though
Wow I never even noticed
Yeah i know about Bec
Serbs/ other ex-Yugo folks (?) sometimes use it in graffitis here
We had it in primary school but that didn’t teach me anything
From 10-13 I had this awesome English teacher, she was strict af but after those 4 years grammar really stuck with me
Ever since, I had two other awful teachers so I learned all the stuff through social media, watching interviews of my favorite celebrities,.. What helped me is not only reading and hearing but also writing and speaking it
(I‘m 19 now and my goal now is to improve my skills talking about politics with native-speakers)
I started learning at 11 as well
My dad is an English teacher so he forced me to study my vocab and grammar every evening, read a lot of books with me etc
I hated him for forcing me to do that at the time but now I'm really thankful for that tbh
I eventually started to watch a lot of YouTube, tv shows and movies on my own, and that's basically how I constantly kept improving (obviously through reading books as well) . So yeah my advice would be keep on reading books in English, and watch a shit ton of movies or tv shows
Good luck, you can do it
When I was 14 or 15, our English teacher introduced us to some English books I that I really loved, this got me into reading a lot
Also, as every teenager I was really into music, and wanted to understand what my favourite bands were singing about - that helped me gather lots of new vocab
I began at around age 13, mostly beginning in video games
Mainly CS:GO . Then i started watching youtube videos to improve myself in the game, and nearly all of them were english speaking youtubers
Then, I started watching more and more english-speaking non-csgo youtubers video and (at age around 16) more english netflix series
Today, I mainly watch every series in english
First learned it in school, improved it by excessive internet consumption
You are 31 and it was not mandatroy in high school for you
Wow, would never have thought that for a western european country
It's not actually Erasmus outside of Europe, that's an EU/EEA program
It's also meant to be a cultural exchange, to promote a pan-European feeling in a young, educated generation
If you only focus on quality of teaching, nothing else - just go there for your entire degree or stay home
Erasmus is subsidised, but still quite pricey
Tbh, I think going from Berlin to any place but Vienna would have been more interesting, even if it's to literally any other Bundesland-Capital
At least leave the big city
Going from the biggest German speaking city to the second biggest one is not even close to as different as you can
Literally any Austrian city or town would be more different
I feel culturally much closer to Slovenes and Italians than Northern Germans
Why
Vienna is amazing and if they like cities it's probably the best choice
That's actually interesting, I think because Germany is much bigger, Austrians are aware of the cultural difference, whereas a lot of Germans aren't and are then surprised when they come to Austria or meet Austrians in another country
True
I realize now that my first statement may be a bit narrow minded in itself
True
I realize now that my first statement may be a bit narrow minded in itself
Yes, i can
And i am pretty good at it i believe
I mean i obviously cant tell their citizenship, but i can definetly tell someones ethnicity if they are european
Really
For us its Germans with flip flops on trails where locals would use climbing gear and boots
Good Tips, but for House hold appliences I will say don't fix which isn't broken
Every new appliance we bought is from the build quality and reliability worse then the older ones
In Viennese German, there's the phrase "Ist wurscht", in Englisch it would be "It is sausage".
It's meaning something doesn't matter
This phrase is commonly used
There is also "Über die Häuser hauen" , which is "Throwing over the houses" in English
This means you are about to go away from somewhere
I know, these are more dialect phrases rather than phrases used in the whole country, but I hope someone is interested in these
"Schau ma moi, dann seng ma scho
Translates to "Let's look and we'll see
", Meaning that you just start something to get going and then decide on details during the process
The fun thing about the Extrawurst idiom is that in Austria there literally is a sausage called Extrawurst
This can cause hilarious misunderstandings, or Germans just laughing in Austrian supermarkets
We also have all of those, except the throwing-ham-sausage-thing
And I don‘t think you‘d hear ‚alles hat ein Ende nur die Wurst hat zwei‘ here either
>"eine Exrawurst kriegen" (to get an extra sausage)
Extrawurst is baloney in English (more or less)
>"the a and the o of something" - the most important part of something (stems from greek alphabet)
Thats not a German saying, thats the name of god in parts of the bible and used everywhere in the world
In English you typically say "the alpha and omega
We have the first too, although a bit different: "Wie die Kuh vorm neuen Tor" - "Like the cow in front of the new gate"
Actually, "Pariser" only is another name for Extrawurst here, too
In Austria, Pariser mostly means someone from Paris, or this sausage
Well they might just be older than our modern languages
Lots of those come from the bible and other historic texts
Did you read the thread title
This is about idioms unique to one country
I have never heard an Austrian referring to a condom as a Pariser, which is why I said, that it only means those two other things mainly
I can't answer your main question, as I'm not a Germanist
Not Belgian or Swiss, but I met an Italian guy in London who was surprised to learn that Austrians spoke German
And the guy was from Milano, which is quite close to Austria
And he was finishing his Master of Law in London
I was so perplexed, that I forgot to ask
I really regret that I'll never know what he actually thought
I camped and hiked on Bunes, Horseid and Kvalvika Beach
Each was great and breathtaking but my favourite was probably Horseid since there was no one else around at all
I can only speak for myself but I like Finnish music
For example Käppee by Värttina
I discovered it because it's used in Dj Snake's "Quiet Storm" and in "Colt" by Sierra Kidd
Cari Cari - they make awesome rock music
Parov Stelar - really cool electro swing
Turbobier - awesome punk band
And some smaller austrian metal bands that I really like are Küenring, Venator and Dead Knowledge
[Die Mayerhofner - Schei wi dei wi du wi dei]
Austria: Ankathie Koi
If you like 80s-style music you will enjoy her
Germany: Lilly Among Clouds
She does Indie Pop, her album Green Flash is amazing and her voice is really special
I'm not Danish but there's an Indie Rock band called 'Death Machine'. I discovered them when they played in a pub in my Hometown and they are amazing
Check out their Album 'Orbit'
I enjoy them quite a bit
It really does hit special if you're in a marching band yourself
> I listened to them in the early 2000s with songs like "bon voyage" and more or less skipped everything until I stumbled upon their recent work
It left me a little Disturbed but in a positive way
Same
Lol
I suppose that would be Vienna vs
the rest of Austria :D
Gotta agree on that one :‘D
We're talking international politics here
There is no grown enough there is just grandstanding and the figurative dick measuring competition -_-
Not in Romanian, as far as I recall
We have quite varied accents and dialects (yet always intelligible), but they’re almost never used in media, since it’s traditionally considered low-class/peasantly to use anything else than the literary language
Only in recent years i’ve seen educated people proudly sticking to their own accents, but this is yet to be mirrored in the media
I bin a wunderschener Schmetterling is among those sentences burned into my brain
Sometimes even Austrian
Also dont forget the huge population shuffle as a result of WW2 and the deportations/resettlements
The west has many different dialects and it can differ from valley to valley
Because they were quite isolated in the mountains
In the east, it's not that diverse
In austria, sometimes individual families (especially farmers) have their own dialects
Idk I am from upperaustria and you can soo easily tell from where someone is, Mühlviertel people talk really weird, people from the mountain region are a whole different thing, Hausrucks stretch all the vowels way too long, People from Braunau are basically bavarians and the people in my neighbor village have a weird obsession with öööö. But yes to northern germans we all sound like the same alien language I guess
Are you talking about Færøyene
Because I learned Norwegian, then Danish, and I could hardly hear any differences in Denmark, except some weak accents (like copenhagen, fyn, jylland)
Norway is like Austria though, with real dialects and differences even in neighboring villages/valleys
Wous
Houst dou mei kernööu gseng
Pretty shure he just comes from the west and can't differentiate them because he doesn't speak them
Most tyrolians see most of upper and lower austria as one dialekt while i can tell you at least down to the bezirk where someone from the waldviertel comes from just based of the dialekt
And of course vorarlberger are the worst at differentiating eastern dialekts, most of them think i am styrian even though i am not barking at all
We also can't differentiate many tirolian dialekts, for us they are mostly the same and 80% is the same and the other 20% aren't enough to differentiate if you don't hear them enough
> vastly different shades of barking
*Looks at flair* Sounds about right
Sure but it's way less difference than in deepest Vorarlberg where people from neighbouring valleys sometimes have trouble understanding each other
I agree, you're right
In Carinthia, you can hear that the dialects from the far west at the border to tyrol sound a bit more tyrolean, and in the east (Lavant-valley) sound more styrian
And yes, in the countryside, they can hear when someone is from the next village
I wouldn't have ever heard of anyone "blaming" Americans for pizza Hawaii
Most people just blame fate
And Hitler, while born in Austria, considered himself German, rejected his Austrian citizenship, and his whole career was based in Germany
So I'd consider that pretty much German
Edit: autocorrect typo -.-
That we started the First World War, and blamed it on the Germans
That’s a standard austrian tactic I guess
>Somehow the blame for most things the EU fucks up ends up in Brussels
Really
All I hear is Germany or Merkel herself getting all the blame and hate
>And Hitler, while born in Austria, considered himself German, rejected his Austrian citizenship, and his whole career was based in Germany
So I'd consider that pretty much German
At that time German speaking people in the Austro-Hungarian empire were called Germans
There were a lot of
ethnicities in the empire, but none of that was "Austrian", most people who identify as Austrians nowadays, would have been Germans before WW1
Austrian identity is a thing that only really started after WW2, when we had to distinguish ourselves from the Germans
plus he was born really near at the German border
I don't think you can blame a single country tbh
You voted to remain, thsi would have been ok to say if you would have chosen to remain, but you didn't, you were one of two that voted leave, so you deserve the hate
Even while that was partly true, Hitler went out of his way to become "German", not "Austria". When WW1 startet, he refused to join the austrian army but volunteered for the German army instead, automatically loosing his Austrian citizenship in 1914
So when he started WW2 he hadn't been an Austrian for 25 years
plus he forced Austria to be annexed
Except it wasn't.
If he voted to remain thats fine by me, but wales can be blamed for brexxit (not entirely of course, but they bear part of it), as they, as a whole, voted to leave
So you threw the irish/scottish under the bus because you couldn't properly utilize the benefits the eu brings
Deutschösterreich ist not in any way the same as eastern Germany
The time that Austria was last understood as "eastern realm" were a few hundred years before that
Austria just is its own name since a loooong time
Our "Higher technical" school had a blacksmith, a foundry and machining classes with lathe and milling
Those we're pretty cool classes
I had waitressing classes, as well as restaurant-level cooking, bookkeeping and economics
We even had a few classes on wine tasting, liquor tasting, and bartending
All before I turned 18
I took Ancient Greek in gymnasium and it was definitely my favorite subject, it was as intense as Latin though
I graduated in 2014 and I am pretty sure my school discontinued the offer by now
We were six students in my whole year in this class and one of I believe only 10-or-so schools in all of Austria that offered it
Truly a dying subject
I think I can pinpoint the school you are talking about
in styria
We have it too in Austria - togerher with psychology in the last 2 years of highschool
So it's each for 1 year
It's part of Biology education here
Also in religious education but I don't know If it's part of the curiculum
At least the R.E. Techer obly said basically don't fuck around and If you so at least use condoms and then He let us watch "Kids". Btw Drug education in R.E. was watching "Requiem for a Dream"
Yeah, but I guess other HTLs should have them too
We have somethimg similar but we call it "tourism school"
I hope so
Yeah, there are the Higher technical schools which specialise into mechanical engineering, Electro engineering and/or IT
Those are the Most common
There is also the Business Academies also common
All of them are Grade 9 to 13 (a year longer then the General education Gymnasiums)
Then there are the nursery schools, some of them you can go after the 8th Grade, some require to be 18
Those are also common
Also schools for Kindergarten and elementary school teachers
Then there are many Not so Common one
There are schools for e.g. building technics, for Fashion and Design and so on
Does any country _not_ have those
I think Gmünd is split between Austria and Czechia
There are also a few alongside the border with Czechia, though some of them had their czech opposite become ghost towns after WW2
Where do we have cities/towns like that
I can't think of one honestly
Iceland
Do we
I can't think of any examples in Austria
I meant in mainland europe, but yeah you are technically correct ;)
Looking at the Norwegian border, you don't have _anything_ there to start with ;)
Like ... even those places that show up on far-out zoom levels ... you go in and it's like three hovels cowering together
Surprisingly I couldn't find any either
I would have expected some city on a river being split
Bad Radkersburg wird durch die Mur von Gornja Radgona getrennt
Salzburg/Freilassing, Braunau/Simbach, České Velenice/Gmünd, ...
Giurgiu / Ruse Pyce
Uhm, you do have a land border with Ireland and Spain (Gibraltar)
The only true island nations in Europe I can think of are Iceland and Malta
Romania for instance doesn’t. It looks like when they drew the new borders in 1918 they paid much attention to not dividing any cities
I can imagine that would have caused even more of a clusterfuck, especially with Hungary
There are cities very close to the border (Oradea, Arad, Gyula), but they are entirely in one country
Ah ok das ist interessant, dankeschön
Those are different towns though that happen to be close to each other and a border inbetween
It is not one that is divided by a border
Giurgiu / Ruse Pyce straddle the border for exampl
By that logic, Berlin is two cities, and Vienna, and many other
These cities evolved together
As are most in this whole post
Well, I can remember the Swiss national museum having a gap for WW2 with just a big sign saying "we were neutral so that's cool" and a itty-bitty-tiny sign saying "but maybe we could have helped some more Jews flee, they kind of all died".
I once was in the Alhambra in Granada with some friends, on the 12th of October (national holiday in Spain)
Around noon we were on a tower that overlooked the whole city
At this moment (noon) the Spanish started shooting cannons and gun salutes and fireworks all over the city, to celebrate their "Spanishness". All the birds of the city flew up at the same moment
We didn't expect any of it and were startled for a second
So my Belgian friend said jokingly: "Oh no, the Germans are coming
I said: "Haha, we have that same joke, but we usually say *'The Russians are coming
'* How weird, no
My friend looked at me with a are-you-fucking-kidding-me look
Then I turned on my brain and figured it out
I had always assumed "The Russians are coming" was a Cold War related joke
However probably it's older than that
Not necessarily a historical event, but I got the impression that especially Americans have quite a different view on how we handled the Nazi era and especially the time afterwords
Like banning all Nazi symbols etc
Here we view it as a necessary step to distance ourselves from our past and to not let it happen again or let people portray it differently than it was, like that we were the victims, that the holocaust didn't actually happen etc
My impression is that a lot of Americans view it as us not having freedom of speech and like it is just another form of oppression
He's viewed ambivalently here
A warmonger, aggressor and imperialist (I know, kettle, pot, black), but also an important reformer
Military, Code Civil, organizing the state etc
that triggered certain developments here as well
Well it is majorly a Cold War thing even though it probably is older than that
Funnily enough the shunned phrase "bis zur Vergasung" is from the First World War, not the Second
No respectable person in Austria believes that nonsense amymore and those who do mostly die away, slowly but steadily
That is not something "widely taught" at all
Well that's not true anymore
This might have been like this in the 80s and 90s but nowadays we learn it in school as extensively as you do in Germany
Nobody under 60 would say that we were the first victims
We take our responsibility as serious as you do
I don't know when the last time was that you were in an Austrian school, but that is definietely not what is taught in Austria's schools nowadays
There has been a public debate about this [since 1986]
That's just his French name
In Old Norman the name is Williame
Yeah, Zürich
Otherwise pretty cool museum if you don't know a lot of Switzerland (and need something to do on a rainy day), but that was pretty shite
Also, a tiny plaque mentioning the extremely late voting rights for women in a room supposed to show how progressive Switzerland is
Mislead supporters and willing enablers
Nobody denies the hundred thousand people cheering for Hitler's speeches nowadays
It was kinda glossed over in the years after it, and we put ourselves in the victim position
But that sentiment seems to change in the last 20 years or so, but there is still a way to go
with that
I would say the current view is mostly realistic
There were a lot of supporters although they probably often had no idea how bad it would get (concentration camps etc) they probably mostly supported him for promising them a better future and Antisemitism was pretty wide spread in Europe and certainly also quite popular in Austria at that time
But I guess we can't see our ancestor's as purely evil either
There were some that fully supported all parts, some did not know the full extent or tried to keep out of it and turned a blind eye and there were of course also some who openly critized or worked against the Nazis
I think this more nuanced view is pretty important here as we try to understand how this could happen and that our ancestors were just evil isn't a very good explanation
But obviously we also have Neo-Nazi who would probably give you a different answer
You guys should have taken a page out of Germany's / Austria's book: condense all your historic shittiness into a 10 year period and then apologise profusely for it instead of dragging it out for centuries
I just looked it up and you really have to take that into context
It is a memorial for the first victims of the Nazi and it explicitly reminds us to never let that happen again
But it might not be the best choice of words
Exactly
You're just one major atrocity away from redemption
Have thought about invading France and shipping the French to the Falklands as cheap (free) labour on the rock farm's there
I am not a history nerd, so correct me if I am wrong, but my impression was that a lot of people wanted to join Germany and anyone who didn't probably would not have a fun life
Have you ever seen that [ballot
] AFAIK that wasn't a secret vote either
So we weren't just victims, but it wasn't really up to us to decide either
Is that impression true
>a lot of people wanted to join Germany
So we I guess we agree on that
I am just saying that most people welcomed them, but even if they did not it would not have made a difference regarding the outcome
I speak a Bavarian dialect natively, so German and Bavarian are fluent
English is too
As for the others:
Swedish: Maybe a fourth, maybe a third or so of the words
Norwegian:  About the same
Danish: A bit less
Dutch: I actually know Dutch, but only at like A1 level so I didn't understand all of it
Still got most of it though
The things I didn't understand I could pretty much all get through context
Low German: Same as dutch, though I didn't study this
Luxembourgish: A bit less than those maybe, but still understood it pretty well
Afrikaans: Also understood a lot of this, similar to the former two/three
Islandic: Even less than Danish, maybe every tenth word or so, possibly less
You can understand about every other word
Especially Dutch, Swedish and Danish are pretty easy to understand
I understand a few words in swedish
Absolutely nothing in Danish, Norwegian or Icelandic
Like someone else said: it's elvish
Dutch and Afrikaans are easily understandable in context though it takes some time to get some words
Luxembourgerish is also somewhat understandable within a context
The german dialects I all understand without any problems
German 100%
Bavarian 100%
Low german 80%
Luxembourgish 85%
I'd like to hear some more people's experience with alemannic
I've heard quite a few Austrians and Germans state they understand nothing while I myself understand pretty much everything
(i grew up speaking a Bavarian dialect)
Nope
Home clothes = no clothes
Sure
Usually pajama-style clothes
Comfy, soft, ugly
I'm also barefoot 90% of the time at home
Socks are only for shoes and house shoes only for when it's really cold
Yoga pants, my husband's worn t-shirt
for winter time you got a cozy dressing gown ;)
Radetzky March
One of the most well known military marches in austria, it's even played on our national day, as well as at the big new year's concert every year
Many consider it an unofficial national anthem
In some countries of the former austro-hungary it is better known as "march of executioners" or "march of death".
What
Why would yodeling offend anyone
C-a-f-f-e-e trink nicht zu viehiel Kahaffee

Nah, it's good bro
Afaik the original version is "everyone who doesn't jump is a Jew" which goes back to at least the 1960s, if not
well, you know, earlier
>I can sing quite well but I cant yodel for shit, despite being a native german speaker
I'm sure <99% of all native german speakers *can* yodel
Like Australians (!) have with their drop-bears, sure
>CK2
Always a merchant republic, most of the times someone from Venice, but I tried every single one, it's just the style of gameplay that suits me the most just politics and hoarding money
>HoI
Played pretty much all Axis Powers and Allieds except UK, not a real bias there
CK II, either Vikings or one of the Spanish Kingdoms
Most of the times I end up as the Kingdom of Jerusalem after crusading a bit or as a satanic Empire trying to devour half the world
.... CK II is fun
Vic II: Mostly Austria trying to reform into the Danubian Federation and freeing all its nations from Prussian, Russian and Ottoman opression
Vicky is fun too
I barely play any european country if it aint given, but if I have to Germany or France, if the countries have stats (like eg health or battle tactics) I’ll go with the better one
Apparently it's "Pfaffenschlag bei Waidhofen an der Thaya". 35 letters
a name you will say to anyone if you listen carefullyyyy
Out of curiocity, are those towns close to each other
Or did its founders just think "we're in Slovenia, there's hills
let's go with it".
Do all these things still exist there
Have they ever existed
The hallow of the white hazel, the rapid whirlpool, the chruch of St
Tysillo and the red cave
I looked it up on wikipedia and apparently it's a reference to the whirlpools in the section of the Menai Strait called *the Swellies*, which is just a mile down the road
The red cave thing was stolen from another parish about a 100 miles away though
Thanks for explaining
Antwerpen
Was supposed to be there for Rampage
But yeah
i've always wanted to visit vilnius, and lithuania in general
i just got some money for my graduation, so i might be able to go on my first ever solo trip there :)
paris, but i feel like rn (summer) isnt the best time to go there
The center of Zürich, and skiing in Kitzbühel in the high season
It's easy to become rich as a tax haven
I found that too, driving through it was plenty enough
Last summer I saw a very old campervan with Irish plates stop in a back street in a tiny village in Burgenland and to this day I have no clue why
Icelandic plates in rural Austria was really weird
Especially because the car wasn't that special, just some regular Golf that you can easily rent for little money
A Jeep with a Canadian license plate spotted in Slovenia
You can see that regularly in Vienna, the often park close to the harbor
Russian plates always are a bad omen
Best to park your car, get a coffee and make sure that the Russian is far away before you get going
Met Russian cars twice on the road, both times I narrowly abvoided an accident
First time the driver went off his line, second time she almost pressed me down into a ravine when I tried to overtake them (driving 30 where 100 was allowed) and she suddenly started driving in the middle of the road
Butter has nearly no lactose and you're not eating a big portion of it in one go, so it should be fine even for lactose intolerant people
Butter + soy sauce is an awesome flavour combination, by the way
Also Klammeraffe ist für mich ein Heftgerät
Ja, i habs als kind für das heftgerät gehört und erst viel später hab ich von dem Primat erfahren
Daher ist meine erste Assoziation anders ;)
"schnabel" would be german for "beak" (like a ducks beak)
For me it's confusing, that snabel is a trunk xD
Well, usually we cheer against a certain neigbhour country
Well i don't follow football but i cheered for England while i was in England
I usually root for Germany if Austria is knocked out
Austrian here cheering for my beloved northern neighbour, love you, Germany, go get em
Grosso
Grosso
GROSSO
Can confirm, hate Germany for no reason too
We hate you cuz you are too similar
How dare you reject nuclear energy
How dare you refuse to pay with card
How dare you not allow google street view
I'm the only Austrian I know who cheers for Germany when Austria inevitably fails at football
Not that I'm much of a football fan, but in general I like you well enough, neighbor
And then pigs would fly, hell freeze over and the world would end
The taste of tap water in Belgium
I really missed the water quality of Vienna
French coffee – weak as the Maginot line
I even got a lot of that in Sussex, but tbf it was a bit hippie-ish in that area
Worse, they put bread in their coffee
A few years ago I was in Bratislava on New Years Eve
The inner city was completely full of British tourists vomiting and fighting
Not what I expected at all
"Pregame" in English
And „vorsaufen“ in Austrian
still big
mind you I'm saying that as somebody from a village with 200 inhabitants, and the next town of 20k people being 40 minutes away
I don't mean ladyfingers artfully dunked into coffee and slathered with mascarpone
I mean regular baguette with butter and jam on it which is then dunked into a bowl of coffee and eaten sopping wet
>Many cultures have a quiet Sunday, but I don't think anyone takes it as seriously as we do
Austria is even worse
No shops, not even groceries are open on Sundays
~~even worse~~ equally sensible
...nothing in particular, I guess
&#x200B;
In a way I'm glad they exist, and that European countries in general are relatively small on average comapred to the rest of the world, just because not everything needs to be huge like China, India, US, Canada etc
&#x200B;
Some of them have extensive intriguing history ofc
&#x200B;
Vatican especially, plus great tourist target, plus still something noteworthy in the diplomatic world even when many people don't care about religion nowadays
&#x200B;
And since nobody else mentioned it, lets not forget the Order of Malta, as the only territory-less "country" that is still officially recognized by others
As probably some people never even heard of it, quick summary:
Religious group of ca
15K official members over the world, plus more hired people and volunteers
Maintain a curious diplomatic status as being recognized as country by over 100 other countries (many others not, but still), have their own passport system, laws, number plates, etc
Members are usually citizens of their home country too, not only of the order alone
Public activities are mostly humanitarian help for catastrophes and war areas, and regular ambulance and/or hospital services in some parts of the world
I like them
They almost always have a specific reason why they are what they are and that makes them rather unique imo
And they should return to or debut at Eurovision
San Marino's back is hurting from carrying the honour of the microstate status year after year
Indifferent; very rarely amused by their government structure (dukes and princes) and/or annoyed by the fact that they're all fucking tax havens
Liechtenstein was basically an appendix of the Austrian empire for the longest time
When that stopped being the case it was kind of considered not okay anymore to wildly annex any neighbor you see fit without consequences
Also they don't border Germany
Haha the comment I looked for
Slovenia is so weird to define in these terms
It was part of the Austrian duchy (or duchies at times) for  a thousand years while still retaining elements that put it into the "Balkans" category - the biggest being a member of the failed Yugoslavist project
As such it is grouped as part of Central, Central-Eastern, Southern and South-East Europe
And for the Americans Eastern Europe
But that definition is weird
At the end it shows that geographical monikers are fuzzy to the point of irrelevance
Yugoslavia is often counted as part of the Eastern bloc and thus allocated to Eastern Europe (especially in the Anglo American context iirc)
Its a bit reductive and misleading imo but so are most regional definitions
Yuuuuuup
So much yuuuuuup
I especially love the American post ww1 maps where croatia-slovenia is labelled Bosnia or Czechia stretches to the alps
Geographical knowledge: About nil
I think you could ask us austrians how well assasinating a high ranking official goes
I am not a fan of Iran, but you can't just kill everyone of your enemies, especially since you aren't at war
Imagine how the Us would react if another country it is not at war with, shot a missile at the US killing Pence
Instant declaration of war
Sadly that's what I think will happen, because that was an open act of War without a declaration of war
I know, Soleimani caused many deaths, but still, you can't just assasinate him
Also Trump often predicted that Obama would declare War on Iran to be reelected
Nice Irony
... the cynic part of my brain thinks how convenient it is, starting something that could Lead to a war  or fights for us troops (on foreign soil,  not in the usa) with the upcoming elections and then the voters have to rally behind the orange guy and vote for him
And convenient oil
And i am really skeptic believing the reasoning and thinking about the weapons of mass destruction, that where the reason for another war for the us, but never existed
How can a self proclaimed first world country react in such a way and not in a diplomatic way
If they are sure he was responsible for the ambassy fire
It looks like some wild West, shoot first, ask after behaviour and nothing how a modern Nation should behave
And afaik nobody was killed at the ambassy,  but it is the reason for assasination
In what world is this ok
Even if its true and he was responsible
Imagine: the second in command of another Nation .... lets for a simple example choose maybe norway
is believed responsible for planning an attack on an ambassy, for example of    serbia
Would serbia react with an assassination
And for the unreal case it would
there would be a massive outcry all over
I am sure they would choose the diplomatic way
It is not ok for the usa in behaving this way
And it looks really like a Bully would act
I should buy shares of US "defence" corporations
Wasn't this guy and his force sort of keeping ISIS in check
Issue an ultimatum
Trust me
I doubt they'd risk an all out war with the US
They will most likely try to pressure others by raising oil prices in the region or making its export harder
So the world stopped formerly declaring wars in recent times and in the US only formal war has to be sanctioned by the us
So the last few presidents have often send troops and basically acted in "warlike" fashion without it beeing war
Is there any discussion in the us about that, if that is a weakening of the congress or if the president should have the power to make such decisions
Or is the country at large fine with it
Iran already can't export their pistachios to europe because of sanctions
In reality because my last call today was with a nice serbian guy and i wrote my reply on the way home after the call
But with historic context i can say: what happened then was wrong and austrias reaction was wrong and look what happened after, because some people thought it more important to be the though country and retaliate with so much over the top force to prevent to be seen as weak
And the lives and wellbeeing of the normal people where not important
I really hope we learned from our past mistakes
....and somebody could see some similarity to the situation then and now
overreaction, destabilization because of self importance, hurt pride and the need to be seen as strong to overcompensate for insecurity
hopefully not as many dead people as then, but its an exponential escalation and i fear many people will die after it
Thanks for the clarification
The Irak war is over, or am i wrong
And they did not try to capture him for a trial, like a civilized country would
>attack on our embassy
That "attack" where some people outside of the embassy were loud, but didn't even enter the embassy
Stop believing your media brainwashing
Mossadegh was an ineffectual leader and a Kremlin asset
Also it was France&Britan that toppled the Shah with Khomeini (who lived in France) because he stood up for Iran
Don't believe the propaganda
Javid Shah
Iran used to do exactly that in the 1970s and they might go back to it if they feel threatened enough / backed into a corner
There will be attacks for sure, question is if they'll only be against US/British/Israeli/Saudi government targets or against the civilian public as well
Experience tells me: Germany or Turkey
Currently
Russia
It would have to be an equivalent force to the combined armed forces of the EU, so Russia really seems like the only candidate who could in the first place
Well, let me guess
Germany again
Nah
Probably not

Maybe
Not sure

Probably not

Hell yes

Never again even though the sea level is raising (insert sad emoji here)

On no wait, that's not an invasion, it's Anschluss
Well, then it will be Russia
Germany
[It takes a Russian to take down a Russian…]
I knew it
Didn't stop you before, and you didn't even have cars or planes back then :P
It was, even if a majority was for it, it was still a foreign military marching over the borders of a sovereign state with the intention of occupying it
If that's not an invasion, I don't know what is
It's not 1938 my friend, the reaction would be quite the opposite now
Oh no
A GRAMMAR NAZI *slowly runs away* ^woosh^woosh^woosh
Three times the charm
Well
You're not a Commie (thinking emoji)
I totally can't tell it from your Username *whistling*
No, we dont have that here unfortunately
If you go out to eat traditional food you have to be prepared to spend a lot of money
If you want cheap food, then you have to eat kebap
Well, there are *Buschenschänke* or *Heurige* and they fit the description quite well actually
They are only allowed to sell their own produce (so it's regional), it's typical, simple Austrian food (cheese, sausages, ham, pickled veggies) and it's really cheap so that farmers and the like can get their calories at an affordable price
Now I'm not talking about the bastardisations in Vienna that cater to tourists and are 5 or 10 times as expensive, those (while not necessarily bad in quality) have very little to do with it all
there are lots of places you can buy cheap schnitzel
Schnizelhaus, schnitzelwelt, schnitzelwirt,...
they just aren't as good as the real thing coming from a good restaurant
They are far from cheap though and mostly for tourists and people making day trips or drinking wine in the evening
When was that, the 1950s?
Unfortunately, Grinzing has degraded to a kitschy tourist village
You won't find many Viennese people there anymore
The Heurigen are still a thing though, but their main purpose was never to feed people, but to provide snacks to go along with the new wine (=Heuriger)
Buschenschanken and Heuriger are for hikers etc
though
Such cafeterias as OP asks about are places in the city where you get a menu for a few euro, usually frequented by students and people on their lunch break (or typically single men who want a warm dinner without cooking themselves)
Its like a small place in the third district where you could have a schnitzel and a potato salad for three euro
But their main purpose is not to provide people with food, but to serve snacks to make them drink more
This is correct
Nothing in Vienna's 19th district (which Grinzing is a small part of) is cheap
Ok i didn't see OP asking for places specifically in the city
That would be a bit different indeed
Buschenschänke/Heurige were not invented for hikers though, those just started frequenting them because they were typically alongside their routes, and serving good portions for the money
Well, in the city we have Würstel-Döner-Hotdogstände instead
Don't know which places you've been to but the ones I'm talking about serve platters for 5 or 6 euros which i wouldn't be able to down a shot afterwards for fear of exploding
My point is that Heurigens are places to drink wine, mainly, because they are run by people making the wine
It's not what OP was talking about, even if you can get good cheap food there
don't know about *great*, but definitely catchy: [Seiler & Speer - Ham kummst]
almost all EAV songs
The problem is: their texts are so great, but non-German-speakers won't understand them
: [Märchenprinz] [Küss die Hand, schöne Frau]
How about [this] Italian song made in Austria by a Georgian who you'd think is Russian
Fuerstenfeld, a cult classic
I dare you to not tap your foot to the chorus, when the bassline kicks in:
&#x200B;
More recently, Wanda have been consistent with their good music
They are Austrian, but love Italy:
"Herr Komissar" by Seiler und Speer is overall just a great song, it deserves some attention
and on a less serious note, more or less, we all love songs like these after a bit too much Jägermeister
Pretty sure "Der Komissar" was very famous, Austria's first chart #1 in the US since Mozart
>Its in German and i wouldn't blame you if you couldn't tell
Hah
I knew it would be 'Vo Mellau bis ge Schoppernou' :D
Edith: vorarlbergian "Grammar"
Very enjoyable
I only now by reading your post realized, that the artists don't have to be from one's country
>Austria's first chart #1 in the US
Nope
That'd be *Rock Me Amadeus*.
000 öS = about 1

>doesn't sound too good
"Lesbische schwarze Behinderte", "Schilddrüsenunterfunktion" or "Kapitalismus" are also great ones - but I like his music in general
Apparently "Saufen" got covered a lot, including some Ballermann-Style versions that seem to not get the sarcasm at all
STS in general have a ton of great songs and translated covers
Welp, guess my citizenship has just been revoked
Also, it was a heavily bastardized version of *Rock Me Amadeus*.

Come on, when has an Austrian expat in Germany ever gone wrong
Edit: thank you kind stranger
Why, thank you
I very much love the UK and I'd love the idea of a swap, but you wouldn't learn much German in Austria, non of us speak it :D
Haha, we do speak, or, at the very least, mumble
There are a number of quite distinctive dialects which technically are all but a couple variations of bavarian or low German as I think it's called
Towards the cities it tends to blend into some sort of standard German, but in the countryside the accents are often quite thick
So much so that a person from the far west of the country (Vorarlberg) would struggle a lot to understand a person from the far east (Burgenland) and vice versa
And we're only talking some 500km distance here
It's got a lot to do with our topography, being separated by mountains influences speech and other parts of our culture a lot
Haha yeah, i must say, watching "Peaky Blinders" and hearing brummy for the first time was eye-opening to say the least
Love meself a good dialect, it really adds depth to people's talk
German dubs usually avoid any strong accents
Maybe in a comedy or satire for added effect
"Schummelzettel", which literally means cheat sheet
Austrians (and parts of Germany) call it "Schummelzettel". Same meaning
>No idea where švinglc comes from
I think it may be related to German "schwindeln" which means to cheat
Or just „Schummler“
Is Spickzettel (glance sheet) a thing in Austria
It certainly was in Germany where I grew up
I don't think Spickzettel is that widely used as a word, Schummelzettel is definitely a lot more common
There's also Schwindelzettel
Similarly, the act of cheating in exams is usually referred to as schummeln rather than spicken
Was it a Texas Instruments calculator
We had to use those for school, and quite a few people wrote their cheat sheets into the inside of the cover
We had lockers
But instead of using them for food we put in stuff like a tea kettle
Our books we just left at home - nobody used them anyways
We had them in high school, but nobody ever used them instead we just left all our books on the desks in our classroom
We have lockers in the hallway for our clothes, though they're used less and less the older students get, and cupboards in the back of the classrooms for all our books and stuff
In my school, we have lockers in the hall for your shoes, jackets, valuables and stuff like that
I never saw anyone put books in them, for those we had a row of small cabinets in the back of the classroom, like those ikea shelfes but with doors
So in my school in austria, we didn't have lockers
However there were shelves in the back of the class where everyone student got a spot to store their books
There were also some lockers you could rent
I  believe my school now has lockers for everyone
Edit: Also most classes are in the same room, just some have special class rooms (music, arts, physics, biology and chemistry)
So you can also leave the stuff you don't need on your desk
The teachers switch between the class room
And the classrooms get locked afterschool, so I just took the stuff I needed to study home with me
In Austria it‘s dependent on the school
Primary schools typically don‘t. Middle schools typically do and higher education varies
Out of the three major schools I know one has lockers (the one with the most students)
„Higher education + middle school“-schools would usually have lockers
Depends on the school
My kid's school has got some, thankfully
In primary school (ages 6-10) no, we just used backpacks and the small compartment under the desk
It wasn't really an issue sinc3 we only had a couplensubjects and 4-6 hours a day
In gymnasium/highschool (ages 10-18) we are given the key to one at the beginning of the year
However every class also had a cupboard with little square compartments the perfect size for slotting textbooks into
Each student was given one, and most use it for everything except for some of the bulkier stuff like arts and crafts materials etc
Might also be important that teachers come to the classroom and not the other way around except for specialized classrooms for chemistry, biology, or crafts
We didn't have them either
But our system may be different than yours
We didn't have to carry our books around all day because for most classes the teachers came to our classroom, we didn't have to leave
And for the few classes we did have somewhere else than our designated classroom, we could just leave our books in little cubbies underneath our desks in the main classroom and just take the material for that one class with us
My friend and desk mate left all her books in a backpack hanging from her desk the whole shool year and only took home the subjects she had homework or a test in
Yes
We took it out during breaks and used it to make tea and instant coffee
Worked very well
Million = 10^6  = 1 000 000
Milliarde = 10^9  = 1 000 000 000
Billion = 10^12 = 1 000 000 000 000
Billiarde = 10^15 = 1 000 000 000 000 000
Trillion = 10^18 = 1 000 000 000 000 000 000
Trilliarde = 10^21 = 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
Quadrillion = 10^24  = 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
All over Austria there are things called "Erdstall", for which there is no translation apparently
They are more or less just holes in the ground, some barely fit a grown up human, others are many meters long but almost none of them allow to stand upright
We know rather little about them as far as purpose goes, we do know that they have been built over the course of at least the past 1000 years, maybe longer
Their high time was between 1000 and 800 years ago
It is suspected that they could have served as mystic places, or maybe they were simply hideaways during times of war and pillageing
Possibly both, possibly neither, we can't be sure as there are barely any traces of artefacts that would explain further why they exist
There are catacombs below many churches but mostly just in the basement
Stephansdom has a more extensive system, but still not as big as paris's
Graz has an air raid shelter network under the castle hill "Schlossberg".
I went there during a guided city tour in elementary school, we emerged from it inside the clocktower
The neighbouring town where I grew up had an coal mine (an old shaft mine, not an open pit mine) and the Nazis added tunnels to it for storage
A problem is that does additional tunnels were undocumented, the town had an problem with an public building sinking because of an cave in of such storage tunnel
First time I'm hearing about this
Actually, under the inner city and parts of the 2nd district, they go as far as 6 levels underground
Some of those cellars are still open to the public, for example the 12 Apostelkeller or the Eszterhazykeller
Famous for not starting any World Wars and Beethoven
Most aistrians would say something about having a rich history culture and cuisine, but I'm just going to add, that of all of the alcohol consumption were to me meassured in pure alcohol, austria would have the highest alcohol consumption worldwide
We started two world wars
We got you covered with the other one
Well well, as an Austrian I can only say: The two of us are Pinky and Brain
And us Austrians have the same love-hate relationship
But somehow we get along with you, Pinky
;-)

Comparing total consumption of something between countries of different sizes doesn't make a lot of sense
The US or China would lead that ranking
I love how Hungary sides with Austria on that one
How very crown-loyal of you both
Only in rural regions
Nope
Most people say nothing, some say goodbye, but that's more a rural thing
No, and I've never seen that happen once
I believe here in Vienna even the bus drivers would be weirded out if you did that, but I guess I'll try it next time
Well yes but actually no, some do it some don't, but nobody really cares, so i wouldnt consider it a custom
I sometimes see people saying "Wiederschauen", which means as much as "Goodbye", to the busdriver, when exiting through the front door
I usually do it myself
It is quite frankly ridiculous of a company to cave in like that
I would say I'd boycott their stuff but I don't play any of their games anyhow
I get that they don't want political stuff on their stream
Fair enough
What stinks of China's pressure is the sheer excess with which they punished player and casters
China wanted an example and Blizzard gave it to them for that sweet sweet chinese mobile market money
Just underlined my decision to never buy one of their games again
Riot put out an official statement that they do not care wheter the casters call them HKA or Hong Kong Attitude
So who else did blizzard ban for ... Idk ... Speaking out against the US or Russia for example
Just because *we live in a society* doesn't mean people can't take a stance
Last time I checked, no hardware manufacturer spoke out against/sanctioned the Hong Kong protests in may way
This is not about "evil China" (and even less about average Chinese corporations) but how Blizzard makes themselves a lackey of their political agenda
I kinda appreciate Croatia's border
Well

Greece is also good

Plot Twist: Czechia is the dick
When I was a kid, I always thought Austria kinda looks like a guitar
It pisses me off
Kurds should get their own state
Also, quite a dick move from Trump to abandon their former allies
Its a blatant scapegoat play by Erdogan who wishes for nothing more than Kurds, ideally the PKK personally, retaliating on turkish soil
If he can play up the “savior of Turkey“ spiel he'll get votes
I will admit I am not very informed about the situation
Maybe I'm being naive here but to play devil's advocate: I can somewhat see Turkey's point of view
They have become fed up with the chaos at their borders and since USA or NATO won't clean up, they are finally doing it themselves
But from the Turkish perspective, a strong, inofficial Kurdish state right in their backyard is obviously not in their geopolitical interest for a multitude of reasons
I don't see why Turkey shouldn't do so:
* The region is still in chaos and under dubious legal status
* A strong Kurdish presence represents a potential danger to Turkish territorial integrity
* The big dog USA currently has a weak, idiotic, and easily manipulated president
* It is a good opportunity to attempt unite the politically divided Turkish people
Even when native German speakers get the pronunciation and the accent right in English, the last hurdle is usually the pitch
German is pretty flat, whereas English is more up and down
So all their words individually might be "right", but when you string them together into speech something's off
It drives me mad, you already put all of that work into your accent and that's the one thing you don't notice
So yeah
Unless someone really worked hard we obviously can tell that they're non-natives
If their accent is really good I might be unsure whether that's an odd local dialect from a region I'm not familiar with - but that's rare
> why does everyone always keep insisting on translating everything literally
Don't go to /r/de
They call reddit "lases", because reddit comes from "read it", so the German translation would be *lases*
We bite the grass
We straighten our slippers
We put the feet up
One thing that's unique about austria is that we are the only country in the world where skiing is considered a national sport
Second thing which I thought could be pretty unique is that our economy relies on both industry and tourism a lot
Although we are not a typical tourism country i believe 10% of economic performance comes from tourism and also we have many very (internationally) succesful companies
and i thought French are weird with their 4 times 20 :D
> 4) Gun and ammunition control is ridiculous, but we still don't have as many gun crimes as other European nations
Check out Austria and Czechia
Here in Austria every adult has the right to own a handgun for self defense at home
Still less gun crime than most of our neighbors
> ...maybe the preference for carbonated water is unique to here
No it's not
Most of Germany's "unique" traits and behaviourisms like that are shared by Austria I think
Except the towel thing
I don't know any other country than the US that also widely allows citizens to carry guns
> Pagan traditions are engrained deep in Catholicism
That alone is not that unique actually
That is something that has happened to Catholicism in particular, and to all kind of religions all over the globe, since forever
Exhibit A: Christmas
Exhibit B: any Latin American country
Exhibit C: Krampus
But I suppose how all that plays out in Lithuania is very one of a kind
Thats not unique to Germany
Yeah I have already heard that from a few Greek friends
I just added to your sentiment that gun ownership rate and gun crime don‘t necessarily relate
If we're counting Austrian Dialect I'd say [Seiler & Speer - Principessa] and [Pizzera & Jaus - Liebe zum Mitnehmen]
The standard German song that comes to mind is [Mark Forster - Übermorgen]
that song was so annoying - a nightclub special
Vorarlberg - the whole country is speaking bavarian dialect, Vorarlberg is speaking allemanic
Vorarlberg
They are separated from the rest of the country by a mountain chain, are the only ones who do not speak Austro-Bavarian German, don't even know where other major Austrian cities are half of the time and are always blushing when Liechtenstein and Switzerland look their way
After WWI, they even held a referendum whether to join Switzerland or not
Also Burgenland because there are 2 names for each village/town
(German/Slavic)
Ja, und wir sind stolz drauf
Also it appears you have a horrible violent crime problem and only one detective to solve everything
Or so I have gathered from the Wallander series
>low German influence
low German
Niederdeutsch
Like in Northern Germany
I dont get what you want to say
Vienna has Lower Austria though, so the borders are afaik way more fluent than with Vorarlberg and Tyrol
At some point in history, it was meant to become a Slavic corridor between northern and southern slavs
To this day, there's a Croatian minority (and also a Hungarian one) in this area
Well, there are towns with three to four official names
For example:
> Oberwart (hungarian: Felsőőr, croat: Borta, romani: Erba) is a city
As taken from Wikipedia
Croatian, slovenian, hungarian anything goes over here
Was willsch damit säga
You could give it to Finland in exchange for Aland
Andreas gabalier
Haven‘t seen [this masterpiece] here yet
You know sh*t‘s about to go down when politicians start rapping
This was before Ibiza tho, guess he‘s working on laments for his political career right now
Andreas Gabalier
Not only is his music shit, he's also a racist asshole
Im pretty convinced that he is only successful because we don't want to repeat the last time when we ignored a wannabe artist with horrible opinions
Honestly it's literally everything performed in German
You either get dreadful rap or insufferable Schlager
Dude, fasten your seatbelt: [
that
was amazing
>unholy mix of gypsy music and stolen Serbian turbofolk
Sounds great tbh
Can you link some
[This] is his most popular song for anybody wondering
But I personally think the [Trackshittaz] are in the race here too
I mean the name gives it away
Came here to post that
Good job
[Melissa Naschenweng] is a close second imo, just (thankfully) less well known
What about [the guy who sings about dumplings from Thüringen]
Thats from austria
Thanks for making him another Austrian people believe to be German, don't mind this one either :)
First he is Austrian and second it can't qualify if it's purely satirical
And he is actually still successful
And kinda underrated:
hooly, I haven't heard that song in ages
forgot it even existed
thank you for bringing up some nostalgia with it
You mean like Corona
Guilty pleasure song tho
Ischgl intensifies
Where you in Schladming
I'ts even worse there because it's his hometown
I mean I THINK they are meant to be taken sarcastically, but the fact that they tried to get into the Eurovision song contest makes me doubt that
Because they're singing in Austrian dialect, nobody, except Austrians and maybe Bavarians, would've understood anything
Do you hear it too
It's kinda different from country to country and the age moving out varies
Some move out already during high school, others move out when they go to university (e.g. in students dorms) and again others move out as soon as they begin to work and earn their own money
I moved out when I was 18
When I had sex at home before that, we just had the TV or music running
> Are the houses built differently
Yes
We built much more massive with a bigger emphasis on quality  and durability
No wood + drywall
It's usually brick and mortar or concrete
What some Americans consider houses would be garten sheds in some European countries
Same here in Austria
> We have an airport without a flight plan that is just barely in use and fund it with 8 million Euros ...
Sounds cheap compared to BER
I don't like it
I think it's generic, inoffensive and boring
Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser was way better
Also it's soooo slow
IMO it sounds ok when a big orchestra plays it, but if you don't have that bandwith of instruments it's just horrible
The melody that Germany stole is much better
Can't we just switch it to "i am from austria" or some new version of the emperor-anthem (after we sued germany for stealing it of course)
pls no anschluss 2
0 in WWIII
You also changed the original text of it
Give us back our anthem or we
, keep making fun of you, <insert evil laughter>
And the lyrics can be basically summed up with "our country is beautiful and we are good at stuff".
Yes, like the Italian or French anthem
"Us vs Them" type anthems are the best
No, that song is nice and all but it was composed by Americans for an American audience and has little cultural or emotional meaning to Austrians themselves
Also, it doesn't really sound like an anthem to me
If it were up to me, I'd take away the German anthem, which is actually a bastardized version of the [Kaiserhymne] the old Imperial Austrian anthem, and make it ours again (with more topical lyrics, of course)
Of course, nationalism, irredentism and pan-whatever-ism were all the rage in the 19th century
The multi-ethnic Habsburg empire was stylized as the #1 bad guy in Europe while overseas millions of non-Europeans were indiscrimitely slaughtered and enslaved
For the life of me I can't remember where I read that, but there was a statistic what country's anthems focus on and it was like:
* 24% Our people best people
* 24% Our military best military
* 24% Our land best land
* 24% Our flag best flag
* 4% Other
I said "if it were up to me" but it's not, so I guess you can keep it
This land is my land is my favorite actually singable US alternative anthem xD
3-6 depending on the season
Jonagold, Breaburn and some green ones Are now available
Too bad Kronprinz Rudolph is only available for a short time
Isn't that the main difference between Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd? Süd being the one which has the big stores and Nord having smaller stores
[Would fit into their country division, too] (in German, but the relevant information is understandable)
Fucking love Pink lady
That makes sense
Was wondering because Hofer usually has big stores but Hofer is a part of Aldi Süd afaik
[Egg harps]
Everyone has one, nobody ever uses it
Seems like they're not very common in other places
[Some cups or plates from Gmundner Keramik]
Probably some "hand-me-downs" from parents/grandparents but I think a lot of households have a few items
Not my country, but the only place I‘ve ever seen flat toasters is Denmark
And in Norway mellomleggspapir – a piece of bread sized paper, that you put in between sandwiches when you transport them
I don't know if [Spätzlehobel] are a staple anywhere except Austria and Southern Germany ...
You might be right - I think the Hungarian one is more intense than what you can get here, eventhough the most famous brandname is "Kotányi", so it implies it's Hungarian
My grandma uses them for fruit salad and ice cream
Often ice cream on top of fruit salad
> Crampons
I remember when I went there how shops had signs outside reminding you to take them off when going inside
But I could totally see why you would want to wear them, it was often times icy as fuck
Came here to see this
It’s an institution in itself, never seen a single household without it
In Austria too
Not in that amounts thow
It is open on the bottom
Almost 50 now and still resisting
Adulthood *and* Gmundner Keramik
While we are talking English ... Who the fuck came up with "hurdy gurdy"? That's such a ridiculous name for an instrument and sounds like it was invented by a drunk toddler
In German it's called Drehleier (turning lyre) which in contrast actually makes sense (because it's quite literally a lyre where you crank/turn a handle)
In Austria, we use 'Sackerl fürs Gackerl' for the bags to pick up dog-"waste". It literally means 'baggie for the shittie', and non-Austrian German speakers will burst into laughter here
Austrian collicual speech has a funny preference for dimunitives
The German language likes to makes nouns connecting their purpose with "Zeug" (thing)
Feuerzeug - fire thing - lighter
Flugzeug - flight thing - plane
Werkzeug - work thing - tool
Spielzeug - play thing - toy
That name came about because on the piano you can play both soft and loud, whereas on its predecesor, the cembalo (harpsichord), every note you played was the same volume no matter how hard you pressed the key
I think it's cute
But it's true, sometimes I can't take Swiss German seriously because of that
We have lots of jokes about that, like your word for condom is "Verhüterli" (which I know it really isn't) and stuff like that
Although to be fair that expression was deliberately created by a PR agency
It's "Blinker" in German as well
no that's bork
nah, that's the mobile phone communication standard
if anything, we would have to call them UMTS or LTE now, and nobody does that
I exclusively say Telefon when talking about my mobile,always did
Weird
I know right
You should start
Personally, I use the -erl diminuitive heavily
I also use other typical Austrian diminuitives like -tscherl, -tschi, -i etc
but very sparsely the Standard German diminuitive -chen
Sackerl is a classic, one of the first words every Germanspeaker from outside learns when they move to Austria
Because they ask in every shop "Sackerl dazu
". And saying "Tüte" is just absolutely not a thing here
Tüte is either an ice cream cone, or a marihuana cigarette (however the latter usually is also diminuitized as "Tüterl")
What is Sackerl in Swiss
Tütli
Maybe it's more of an Austrian thing
I say Telefon almost exclusively as well
Sometimes a Handy slips in but it's the exception rather than the rule
My dialect is way too far gone to even consider calling a handy/smartphone "Telefon" non-sarcastically
Most people I know call it handy without a second thought
"Wos darad ma ohne handys
" or "Duas handy weg
" for example
Could very well be
-sent from my Telefon
Maybe a mixture
I grew up with landline too and didn't have my first mobile until age 20 or so, but I can see your reasoning and it's probably correct for many
Oh poor busted me xD
that's entirely true
As a native German speaker I perfectly understood the last sentence
There are commas-rules where we put thousands of commas in one sentence
Yeah I tend to not use any commas at all in English
That's quite different to German
In Austrian German its really weird, because a "the" in front of a name is completely wrong in written Austrian German, but normal in spoken Austrian German
Not using a "the" in front of a name is really weird in a spoken sentence, but normal in written
You say 50 dollar too
Not dollars
Dollars are single bills
Actually, it's van Go*coughingfit*
Yeah I wasn't sure about that, thats why I was only talking about Austria
Aren't there a few regions in Germany were they never put an article in front of a name
A subtle difference but one a native speaker would indubitably notice
Just yes, really
Hungarian is ... hard
Hard and weird
Totally missed that
Nice joke lmao
We know
It's definitely more civilized than the Austrian one
Granted, the way a lot of things are done in the UK parliament are archaic (like the "ays" and "noes"), but all in all they still have a level of politeness
In Austria, MPs have called each other "peasant twerp", "the one with a behavioural disorder", "lousy creature" or - my favorite-:
"You are exactly the one head short where your brain should have been"
While some of these insults were made during speeches, a lot happens in interjections by MPs that are supposed to just listen to the one speaking
Last year a conservative MP interjected: "You're not in Bosnia, we have rules here
" to a MP who was born in Bosnia
Honestly I think it's rather civilised in comparison
At least they got some etiquette
And when Blackford called May a liar he was immediately asked to take it back or to be removed from the session
In Austria a politician can call union people male genitalia and the speaker doesn't even react
> But you're right
They are more rowdy than in other countries
Except perhaps Ukraine, where I know for a fact, there has been a least two fist-fights involving more than 3 MP's in the last 10 years
[Meanwhile in Kosovo]
There's another version of this, where they also show Vitaly Klitschko - he abstained from fighting, because he thinks that they should make politics with their heads, not their hands
Maybe they're just so used to tear gas at that point, that they've created some kind of immunity
We "go sex"
I secksed ur mum
But you don't often add the tun (doing) to that
Those are stand alone verbs like 'to fuck'
Poppy seeds are used the exactly same way as in Czechia, unsurprisingly
Food
Interesting sidenote: I went to Bolivia, everyone there chews coca leaves, but poppy is illegal (even for cooking) and many people don't even know what it is
We use a lot of poppyseed in traditional dishes
Also, the flowers are really pretty
There is a traditional use for poppy as a tranquillizer for infants though (when they cry uncontrollably), it's called "Mohnzuz" and as far as i can gather it's some sort of pacifier that's made from/with poppy seeds
I haven't heard of anyone using it for ages though
There is the alcoholic equivalent too, a "Mostzuz", which uses cidre
Mohnflesserl ftw
I'm with you
Mohn is best used sparingly
[Mohnzelten] Yeah, no thank you
>Hereitkuchen
The what
Haha
I had to google "flesserl - we call them Mohnweckerl in my neck of the woods
I only learned not too long ago, that Mohnflesserl with salt on it only appear to be common in my area (upper Austria) and not all around Austria
Only heard it because some guy (from Vienna) said that he didn´t know they existed until a branch of Leberkas Pepi opened in Vienna and sold them there
Yeah im a Lower Austrian living in Vienna and we don't put salt on our Mohnweckerl here - gotta try your variant out tho :D
Mohnflessal ghean ohne Soiz
If you like Leberkäse, then go to Leberkas Pepi in Vienna, afaik he has them
And his Leberkäse is really really good
(many different sorts of them)
Kommt drauf an: Wenn man damit Süsses isst, dann ohne Salz
Mit Leberkas oder wenn man damit was Deftiges isst: Dann ist es mit Salz verdammt gut
Nein, ich bin firmly Team salzlos
Aber ich mag auch keine Salzstangerln
Die mag ich ehrlich gesagt auch nicht so sehr
Aber auf Mohnflesserl ist das Salz gut
Passt, du kriegst die mit, ich krieg die ohne :D

And The books of Marx and Engels are often called "Blaue Bände" (blue volumes) since the most common compilation was published in blue covers
Girls in my School used to double every vowel and add a b in the middle to not be understood by us boys

The 2008 football EC group stage match vs germany
if austria won 1:0 instead of losing 0:1 austria would've advanced and eliminated germany at the same time at a euro cup played on home soil
austria would've finally had a football achievement that eclipsed 1978 cordoba
We don't demand such ludicrous shit from serbia after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and therefore don't have a reason to invade them
There was a priest who saved Hitler from drowning when he was a kid, imagine if he just didn't notice it
We have so much shit on our plate
Love your pick
that was a pretty embarrassing loss yes
I lived in the UK and yes they do
also on the sidewalk when two people first walk in the middle and then both get to the left side to avoid eachother
it's not just the UK, I noticed this in most countries with left side traffic that people will generally walk on the left

Nope, we say "das 17

I am not exactly sure about maximum prices for certain goods, but we have what is called "laesio enormis" and "Wucher" which are juridicial tools to void a contract which either means something is very overpriced or where someone is extorted or the desperation is abused
Laesio enormis ("Verkürzung über die Hälfte" "not being worth at least half of it") means that the thing you buy must at least be half of the value of the price (with certain exceptions)
Otherwise you can sue to void the contract or the seller has the opportunity to compensate to match the 50% of value
Wucher (usury) is more flexible when it comes to the misproportion of value/countervalue and it also focuses on extortion or abusing a weak position of the other person, his young age and therefore not being able of proper judgement, or special desperation and so on
It is a flexible system and it also is there to void a contract
It is one of those things, that if someone ever tells you the ‘Allies were the good guys’ or something, that in reply, you should tell them to fuck themselves
In reality, the Allies (especially the Soviet Union aka the second Mongol Empire) were just as bad as the Axis
The only difference is that they won
The Yalta Conference was disgusting
It was what ultimately divided Europe in half for nearly 50 years
Poland should have received the ‘square deal’ the Western Allies promised them, but instead the US and UK bent over for Uncle Joe’s cock
I blame FDR the most for this, since he was a very close friend of Stalin
Churchill, on the other hand, was the most respectable of the Big Three (not that that says much), and he was certainly less forthcoming to the Soviet Union and their demands
If it wasn’t for the US, Operation Unthinkable may actually have occurred (it didn’t mostly because of US opposition to it, isn’t that funny
), and the Soviet Union might not have gobbled up half of Europe after all
Oh well
The Allies were just as spineless and corrupt as the Nazis were
It wasn’t exactly the first time the Allies pretty much sold out an entire country to appease someone
You’d think that, you know, after the end of a large part of a conflict that resulted in the deaths of ~70 million people, that the ‘Allies’ would get together to resolve their differences and rebuild a devastated continent
Nope
Instead they erected a giant fence across half of Europe, from which no former Warsaw Pact country has completely recovered from yet, and then completely turned on each other
Got to love humanity, right
The fact we were basically not mentioned in the conference probably helped prevent us from being split like Germany
Honestly this is a common feature of many Eastern European nations when dealing with their communist legacy
Externalising the countries own collaboration or communist movement and faulting "Russia" as the single responsible historical actor
They are doing a post 1945 Austria in this regard
Roosevelt and Stalin were pretty great friends, as it happened
Definitely quite a few similarities between the two as well
They both also had a personality cult and ruled mostly through propaganda that made them look larger than life
Afaik most Americans did not even know their president of nearly 13 years had polio and was handicapped
Churchill was no hero either but at least he wasn’t as much as a puppet, unlike FDR
Out of the three he was the best by far
He was also of noble blood whereas Roosevelt and Stalin were of common peasant background (yes, the Roosevelt family was rich, but they still had not a drop of blue blood in their bodies
Quite frankly, they were rich paupers)
Poland wasn’t exactly ‘occupied’ between 1795 and 1918 either (at least not in the sense that is being implied), it simply ceased to exist (which is probably even more insulting than being occupied or a puppet state)
Oh, I’m definitely not defending the US or any of their presidents
Literally every US president has been a stuck-up pseudo-dictator who only ever gave a shit about the 1% richest of their population
I also cannot think of any US president (or even US politician period) who was of humble origin
Maybe Lincoln I guess (but he was pretty rich by the time he became president)
You know, I see a lot of parallels between French and Yank culture
Especially when it comes to both thinking their shit smells good and that they are ‘better’ than everyone else (although Americans are still much worse in that regard)
Well, chauvinism is very associated with France after all
Let’s not forget that the Treaty of Versailles was unfair and way too harsh
No country could have possibly paid the reparations that were asked of Germany due to Versailles
It was ultimately what paved way for the NSDAP in the first place
That’s what happens when you back a proud, but humiliated people in a corner
They eventually have enough and want to strike back
Can you really blame them
I would quite enjoy living nearby the sea, even if it means flooding Slovenia ;)
American car scene
Cannabis Laws from the Netherlands
Do that many people in Danmark have a garden
Or are there prepared areas where people come together and plant trees there
Ah, I thought the people are planting them themselves
That wouldve been cooler
That would be [Zirbenlikör] or just "Ziabn", a liqueur flavoured with the cones of [a certain species of pine]
PS: tastes ... sweet and strongly of wood resin mainly
Very medicinal as well if you got a bad stomach or anything really ;)
Gin tonic with a slice of cucumber, crackin summer drink
Heck yeah, "Schliwo" is awesome :D
For Austria, i‘d rather say Schnaps
Either from apple, pear or plum
Everyone drinks it due to peer pressure, and dislikes it for its terrible taste
Every time someone puts a bottle of a selfmade one on the table they say „but this is a good one“. I automatically assume it will be a terrible mixture of petroleum and fruit
Almdudler is also very popular
80er Stroh, literally useable to kill of insects, tastes like death and misery and only used if you absolutely don't want to remember the last 7 years of your life
It's also the German word for distilled liquor
If I remember correctly Gin during that time was very pure alcohol and the poor drank it like water
It got so bad that London's poor were always drunk
Big fan of rosmary or basil in my gin, myself
I made elder flower gin just the other week, it's lovely with some orange
Yeah Zirbenschnaps is not a thing in my region, it's all about the pear schnaps
Kletzenbirn, baby
I'm not into neat liquor, but it can be alright, and I know plenty of people who savour it
Last time I checked, Almdudler is not a liquor
just import it, domestic plum spirits are called zwetschgenbrand
I missread it
I can't judge it very well, because of course like most others I've learned it passively over the years
Once you get over the weird spelling rules [(orthography)] I guess it's not too hard
On another note, I believe these weird dick-measuring contests over whose language is harder are stupid and pointless
Having grown up with a supposedly more complicated language doesn't make you more intelligent or the superior human being
For me it's not hard at all, but I know a lot of people who still struggle with pronunciation, spelling and grammar, even after 8-9 years of learning the language
I just got lucky, my dad forced me to study my vocabulary every evening, to get my spelling down and to read books in English with him when I was in middle school, otherwise I'd probably still be struggling like so many other people I know
I don't think there's a major language with easier grammar than English
Orthography is the biggest mess since French tho :)
As a nativ German speaking person
let’s put it that way, I struggle more with German rather than with English lol
I never learned anything at all, I just watched YouTube Videos in english since I‘m six and I now have really good spelling and grammar
As a non-native speaker, I agree with you
It seems people have a chip on their shoulder when it comes to English and for some reason  feel the need to assert their superiority by bragging how complicated their language is compared to it
What is a common thing on reddit that would never happen if reddit was Europe-only
Once Ive put on Facebook that I got a baby an MLM brigade came after me, it was insane
I think they are just more specific in their target group around here
oh come on this is just not true
every single local newspaper comment section boils down to "b..b..but ~~muslims in headscarves~~ refugees

maybe this is way different in France, but I doubt it
edit: okay guys you can stop telling me that Muslim is not a race now
I think we all know what I meant and you're only proving my point here
Uhm try being Austrian or Swiss on r/de
Not a big difference
I think american football has quite a big following in europe as well
Have a link maybe
top lads as far as I'm concerned
Yes, it was all about losing my pregnancy weight, treating my body after a hard time or making lots of money during maternity leave
It was really creepy and annoying until I blocked everybody
Who is us
It's no problem at all in Austria
Same for me in Austria
Austrian - Wien
English - Vienna
Spanish – Viena
French – Vienne
Czech – Víden
Estonian – Viin
Hungarian – Bécs
Dutch – Wenen
Polish – Wieden
Fun fact: there ist a district in Vienna named Wieden
Not a city but a federal state: Carinthia vs Kärnten threw me off at first because all the other states are fairly similar to their austrian name, except this one
(Salzburg, Burgenland, Vorarlberg stay the same, Upper and Lower Austria aka Ober- und Niederösterreich which basically means the same, Vienna aka Wien, The Tyrols aka Tirol, and Styria aka Steiermark, but Steiermark deprived from the name Steyr so I get that one too
Carinthia is the only one that I don‘t get
>German cities
>Vienna
Hab' ich den Anschluss verpasst
Carinthia is Kärnten here
It's funny because Vienna has a district called Wieden
TIL der Bodensee ist Lake Constance in Englisch
Anybody know on who that name is based on
I‘m hella curious now
Give them to Switzerland, we have enough Alpine weirdos already
It's Donau for us in Austria and Germany
I actually started using mapy
cz because I wanted to be less dependent on google
There is Open Street Maps, an open source alternative that I use sometimes
Does it work for Austria
Edit: It does
Nice
Edit2: Wow this is site fantastic
Bergfex has a lot of hiking trails and the weather cast is pretty good too
Sure
There is a lot less on it though
Many shops and whatnot are missing, and street view simply doesn't exist
In czechia is pretty comparable to google maps, here it's just
Okay
I use [AnachB] for route finding
It is really good for public transport, walking and bikes and uses basemap
That would be like trying to stop smoking by changing from Marlboro red to Camel light
Well I have both an Android and an iPhone so I needed something that works on both
I mostly use maps for traffic related stuff (routes, public transport), and it seems to work very well in that area
Has all the Wiener Linien connections
And I don't really care about street view
Because both are big comic villain companies from America who steal your data

Lol i cant even remember commenting on this post, well it seems i had a few beers too much yesterday
I thought Britain = England + Wales
Ah, ok
Thanks for explaining
I think The Troubles lasting for 40 years are an indicator that it's a bit more complex than "England doesn't want to let go". Also looking at elections there's almost a perfect 50/50 split between British Unionists and Irish Republicans
Will be "fun" once Brexit is through
Huh
Never saw it like that
Was under the impression it related to being in favour of the Irish Republic in contrast to the British Monarchy
1 EUR = a litre of discount milk
10 EUR = 2 days public transport ticket in Vienna
100 EUR = a refill at a gas station and some candy to go
Wasn't that bad when I was there
It definitely wasn't cheap, but not much worse than Austria (doesn't help that groceries are pretty expensive in Austria as well)
Except Beer, 25€+ for a six-pack is criminal
* F steht für Freunde die was unternehmen -> F is for Friends who do things together
* U steht für uns, dich und mich -> U is for us, you and me
* N steht für endlich haben wir mal Spaß -> N is for finally we have some fun
Wow the french version is one of the worst dubs I've seen so far
You do realize "N" as a standalone letter is pronounced "eN"? So if you say it out loud it makes perfect sense
"eN ist für "eNdlich"
Obviously ... do you really think they make different translations for swiss and austrian german
We learn both but it depends on the school on when you learn which
I learned cursive in first grade primary, then switched school and the new class learned printed-like in first grade and cursive in second
So I personally only learned cursive
I find it crazy that Germans and Austrians regularly claim that they write cursive while they don't. Most ppl write some weird mix of 80% normal 20% cursive
Idk where they learned that
The ppl I went to school with do that too and I can only write pure cursive, because that's what we mainly learned
Exactly this is how it's done here as well
*Exactly* the same how it's done here and how it was for me as well
wtf which exotic school teaches cursive first
i thought first year print letters, second year cursive was universal
Which is normal
You find some "handwriting" for yourself
There's a few letters that you change, just because you get sloppier or adapt because you can never read them
Most people look at me weird when they take a close look at my signature because my "b" is still cursive and not printed-like
But I purposefully changed my r's and n's because they looked like v and u, respectively
Even cursive changed over time, I learnt it differently than my sister 5 years later, e.g. how you write a, o, t, r, etc
Now they're even closer to print letters
Read my comment about the intended learning process [a bit further up] some people are stricter in sticking to what they've been given, others deviate more – it's all fine and part of properly learning cursive
Like always, the Spanish know what's important in life and what's not
But that's how you properly learn cursive
First, you learn how to read and write print letters
Then, you learn a neutral base set of letter forms and the concept of joined writing, you train it for a few years, and then you are encouraged to create your own writing style from it through repeated usage
Back in school (Austria, early 90ies) we used [this set] which officially is called "Ausgangsschrift" (base font; writing from which to progress on to your own style) for that very reason
Colloquially it's just called "writing font", because that's what you use to write things by hand
A few years later they reformed it and now it looks even simpler, [like this]
It's important to note that it is *not* a a strictly defined set of letters that you have to adhere to for all of your life
I stopped writing my capital X's like in the example above sometime in fourth grade I think (I mean just *look* at them
The good thing is, nobody expects that, but the point is learning this base set of letters allows you to develop your own speedy writing style, that's hopefully (at least somewhat) joined-up (which is faster than printing your letters) and universally legible
When Anglos are all "cursive is so difficult, we don't need it anymore because We HAvE TaBleTS nOw", I think they are referring to their own fossilized and cumbersome system that they apparently clung to for a few decades too long (like the [Palmer method] or [D'Nealian] ugh those G's)
I wouldn't like cursive either if I thought *this* is what it was supposed to look like
Sure, let's chuck out 3,000 years of cultural achievements because pressing those buttons is so comfy yo
No seriously, I get the sentiment, but whenever I hear somebody from the "I don't need to write lots with my hands anymore, we do everything through apps now" crowd, I just can't fathom what their life must look like
So you seriously never scribble down notes in a meeting, or write a shopping list, or pen a message to your mum, or put some talking points on a whiteboard
If I had to do all those things in the narrow confines of some app I'd go crazy with how constricted it feels
And I'd feel so bad if I couldn't do it by hand at least somewhat legibly, and efficiently for more than half a sentence
Pen and paper are such a super super super low-level kind of tech: easy to manufacture, intuitive to write with and store, and allows for easy access to the information
I honestly would be scared for humanity if we gave up writing by hand just because for the past ten years Apple has been selling us tablets
Uhm, isn't that the whole point of writing in cursive
(Cursive as in normal "joined writing" mind you, not some special or archaic form; English seems to be peculiar in that it's lacking a proper term for it
Rural area, east styria
apparently, both is possible [and up to the teacher] TIL
most successful scam by far is the Sound of Music
People handing you a flower (usually a rose) or wanting you to take a picture with them, then demanding you pay them for it
Also asking for a signature and then a donation
Not as much tourists, but people trying to move to the city: People offering a fully furnished rental flat at a good price, but requiring you to transfer the first rent "in advance", then never contacting you again
Ticket sellers dressed up as Mozarts, they hawk you and act really aggressively
Beggars with really weird body deformities
Normally they are part of a beggar syndicate
Munich Oktoberfest:  be carful of servers who "self tip", aka not give your change back/give you too little back
Not every server does it but it does happen
The taxi scam happened to me multiple times the same day
I wanted to take a taxi back to my hotel from the mall of Istanbul and the driver wanted payment in advance - he did exactly as you said, I think I handed him a fifty and he switched it for a ten
I said sorry and handed him another twenty and he switched it out again, but this time I saw it
I started to argue with him and suddenly a guy came up to the car, opened the door and dragged me out of the car
I was way too scared to do anything, ask for my money back or even call the police
I eventually found a driver to take me back, who upon arrival switched out the notes too, but this time I just yelled at him that I was gonna call the police until he let me go
Never went anywhere without a native speaker after that
Everything in Hallstadt, I mean 200 gramms of salt for 13 Euros or Restaurants at the lakeside charging 27 Euros for a simple Schnitzel
That’s sweet of you

I'll eat the tentacles off of any cephalopod you serve me and i love octopus the most
Weirdly, i'm also really curious about the live ones
Such intelligent and alien creatures, it's fascinating
Calamari fritti is one of my childhood memories from vacations in italy
Loved it, still like it
octopus and squid
best things I ever ate when in greece
filled with goat cheese and bell peppers and I wouldn‘t need anything else
recommend 10/10
edit: and it‘s not the same everywhere
when I was in croatia it didn’t taste as good, sry friends
pretty normal thing to do, and we don't even have an ocean in this country
It‘s not something I see every day
Or anything I‘d see in Austrian cuisine at all (For obvious reasons
We don‘t have any kind of ocean bordering us
But if I go abroad it‘s not something I‘m weirded out by either
Aka I‘d totally eat it without being disgusted
Uff pulpo gallego is the best
I'd take a bath in the stuff
Lol I thought you were writing about eating live ones in the second paragraph, but then I luckily read the second sentence
Yeah sounds like you're on to something
Calamari
Ich dachte, das ist sehr beliebt in DE, no joke :0
Do you draw a line for types of fish too or do you est fish at all or
Just genuinely curious
So are pigs, and I have no problems eating those
>pulpo a la galiciana
This is *such* an Italian mistake, I love it
I was in Cantabria this summer and the amount of eucalyptus there is crazy
You literally see it in the landscape when you cross the border from Bizkaia to Cantabria, bc those poison green leaves start sprouting everywhere all of a sudden
I suppose planting them is banned in Euskadi
Armie Hammer, is it you
Vienna for the provinces
The provinces for Vienna
Otherwise really local
For example the Upperaustrians meme about the Mühlviertel (countrybumpkins) and especially the district of Rohrbach (countrybumpkins who kill you due to reckless driving)
Edit: some moodsetting for the Mühlviertel
As someone just 5 kilometers away from the Mühlviertel and as a native of the district Eferding (basically farmer central in the upperaustrian heartland) I prolly should also confess that we're also a bit countrybumpkiny
The Burgenland is the incest-joke region of Austria
> Mykonos kind of, due to most tourists being mindless party goers
"Es war der Wein von Mykonos "
Horrible German Schlager
Burgenland is the most stereotypically "redneck" region for me
I think Dialects are also a big meme potential, especially Wienerisch and Vorarlbergerisch
Well there's always Burgenland and Carinthia for memes
Also Amstetten
Aptly named
DieTagespresse always jokes about how nobody would care if we would give the Burgenland to Hungary as long as we could still drink the Wine
heilige makkaroni
Most of them are tbh
Also because it's the flattest region of Austria
And St
Pölten
A city you only visit to die there
Amstetten truly is Austrias sex dungeon
And not the fun consensual kind
Pas de Calais= strait of Calais (= Dover Strait)
About "can" - a lot of people actually can live (for a while) in the USA, but relatively few choose to
I probably could live/move there, but in general I'd treat it similar to moving to the UAE/Saudi Arabia/China/Iran/Japan
it might be nice and interesting to be an expat there for a while, but from what I've seen so far, I doubt that I would want to permanently move
Absolutely not
for like a year yeah why not
like you said, getting new experiences and influences sounds great
also would love to visit some of the national parks you have, it seems insane how much open, uninhabited space you have
I enjoy my lifestyle here
I would go if theres a work opportunity there for me, but as things are there is no reaspn to give up my comfortable life here
I am in the USA from time to time for business, and there are a few places I could imagine living in
Unfortunately, those are pretty expensive, so I would rather stay in Austria
Living 3-5 years in New York as a 20-something with a good enough income could be great - Boston and Seattle would be cool too
And I like the smaller college-towns
I wouldn't want to do it long term, because of the reasons everybody else mentions here
I have the experience that women are very private about it but once you are pregnant everything changes and women don't talk about anything else anymore with you
my mom got, and still gets every time, very graphic when describing the act of her giving birth to her first-born abomination, which is me, who destroyed her nether regions
my brother was apparently an angel
Yeah ofc, my mom told me a bunch of while she was pregnant with me and of when she was pregnant with my brother but sadly she‘s very forgetful
Or she just doesn‘t like talking bout it that much but usually people talk about it openly
We have a saying that goes "3 Bier sind auch ein Schnitzel" ("3 beers make 1 Schnitzel")
Linsen mit Knödel (lentils with dumplings) or goulash for me
If my mom baked and I‘m down I go with her apple pie, but mostly when I‘m sad I either don‘t eat at all or go with [Toffifee]
I think most people go with alcohol tho
Edit: I just now noticed you said „relax and enjoy“ at the end
Then I personally don‘t have one since I don‘t like alcohol and usually just cry in my bed
Most people would probably still go with alcohol
Das bisserl das ich esse, kann ich trinken auch

German adds -land to a few certain countries, but not to others
Idk what the system behind it is really
Greece = Griechenland (Greek-Land)
Russia = Russland (Russ-Land)
Belarus = Weißrussland (White Russ-Land)
Germany = Deutschland (German-Land)
Switzerland = Schweiz (here it's vice versa lol)
Estonia = Estland (Estonian-Land)
Latvia = Lettland (Latvian-Land)
also
Austria = Österreich (Eastern Realm)
France = Frankreich (Frankish/French Realm)
Most other countries are pretty similar to the English spelling, with minor differences
E.g. longer country names have of course a translation (e.g. Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika for the USA, but "USA", the letters pronounced in German, is used too)
German spellings often have minor differences, mostly based on the pronounciation of letters (Czechia-Tschechien, Chechnya-Tschetschenien, Chad-Tschad, Canada-Kanada, Botsuana-Botswana), or the originally Latin ending *-ia* becomes *-(i)en* in German (Italien, Indien, Spanien, Australien Litauen, Polen, Serbien, Kroatien, Syrien, Albanien)
A few countries have the ending in -ei for some reason (Slovakia-Slowakei, Turkey-Türkei, Mongolia-Mongolei, Czechia-Tschechei (not official, very colloquial))
Countries with "North" "South" and "New" are translated as well (South Sudan-Südsudan, New Zealand-Neuseeland, Northern Ireland-Nordirland, North Macedonia-Nordmazedonien)
Austria - Österreich
Netherlands - Holland (colloquial)
Belarus - Weißrussland
Germany - Piefkinesien
Rakousko sounds pretty awesome for some reason
Hochwähli für Piefkinesien
You have to complete this
Germany - Piefkinesien
Germans - Saupreißn
just been joking, its a cute little [nickname]
It comes from Old High German ['Ostarrîchi']  \- which literally means Eastern Realm
(modern German "East" = "Osten")
Bussi :D
Ich versteh bis heute nicht wie man als Standardsprachler ohne auskommt

That sounds like Alkomat, the thing you blow inside when they suspect you've been drunk driving

Jo eh, bast eh so :)
Ah okay
So basically a direct translation
Oh that's cool
I knew Germany is basically Saxony in Finnish, but that is news to me
It's the same in German with barber shops
They either use the German word "Haar" or the English word "hair" in their puns
Not shops but our tash cans on the street mostly have cute little wordplays on them revolving around
well trash
From the top of my head:
"Hasta la mista, baby
" (You got the trash, baby
"Hairlich"
"Hairzig"
"Feinschnitt"
"Head Coutoure"
"Schnittpunkt"
Also, Herr Kutz in GTA 5 :D

Still my favourite
We read the whole thing in Mittelhochdeutsch in German class in high school
Although, my German teacher was in fact a schlagender Burschenschafter, very clearly a pan-German nationalist and allegedly a Kellernazi (he constantly talked about how "unjust" the current German-Polish border was, and how "degenerated" the new orthographic rules were, and how we Austrians are "actually" really Germans, and how there's too many US-TV-shows with black people in them on the "bolshewik" Austrian Public Broadcasting; also he was a linguistic purist and prescriptivist)
So that might have had to do something with it
Still, I liked the Nibelungenlied
It's a cool story
I can still recite the first stanza
Generally we often read stuff that was for school purposes very ... unconventional
Like Ernst Jünger's super-boring and WWI-glorifying novel "In Stahlgewittern". Our teacher was very opposed to reading its more anti-war counterpart "Im Westen nichts Neues", because he thought Remarque was a weakling who complained too much
we studied it in school and I'm from austria haha
It's actually a nice story
> Wtf is a Kellernazi, never heard about that ~~impression~~ expression
Somebody who is an old Nazi, but not in public
They only *really* let it out at home in the Keller where nobody can see or hear it
In the Keller they have a bunch of old swastika flags and a Stahlhelm, and an old Luger, and a signed 1st edition copy of "Mein Kampf". And once a week they lock the front door, go down into the basement, put on their SS-uniform, sing the Horst-Wessel-Lied and "Die Wacht am Rhein" in front of their Führerporträt and shed a salty, salty tear into a glass of German beer for the Downfall of the 1000-year long Reich
And once a year on the 20th of April, they go to their  favourite restaurant and eat [Eiernockerl mit Salat]
So basically Alexander Gauland
> I am astonished that you read "In Stahlgewittern"!
In hindsight, so am I!
> Didn't the ~~Director~~ headmaster or principal [director = Regisseur] have anything to say against that
Not really, teachers are usually relatively free to do what they want
Of course you can't just uncritically read "Mein Kampf" or something like that, but "In Stahlgewittern" is not openly a Nazi-book or anything
It's a "just" a pro-war WWI book, by an author who "just happened" to be very well-liked among Nazis and other ultra-nationalist circles during the Weimar-period
> And when were you in School actually
I successfully passed my Matura (Austrian Abitur) in 2010
So not *that* long ago
> but reading the whole thing in middle high German would probably be a bit much for a seventh grader
Yeah ... we did that in the 5th (= German 9th) grade
Personally, I thought it was very boring
But I thought most things we read in school were boring
Our teacher using teaching methods from the 1960s (taking turns reading out loud in class for *hours and hours*) wasn't really a huge turn-on for reading
Exception: *Die Räuber*. We read that out loud, but "in character", I had the role of Spiegelberg
We really got into it and really acted it out
They are
Ulrich Seidl even made a nice movie about it
[Here's the trailer]
We currently have to defend our garden against a wild roebuck that thinks the things growing in our garden are delicious
Else it's mostly smaller animals that dare to run around in the village
A cat chasing a squirrel isn't that uncommon
I often see hares, frogs and grass snakes which unfortunately seem to love my garage
Sometimes I see deers, more in safe distance on the fields and not near the houses
Weasels too, but some neighbours raise chickens so I guess those attract them
Once I saw a fox, but it honestly looked very meager and desperate
Hedgehogs, rats, weasels, foxes, badgers, ducks, squirrels and more
All of these are fairly often seen in Vienna
I personally have seen all of these except badgers
I live at the border of a city in Austria and we have wild deer, rabbits and Mustelidae in our gardens
Deer do love to eat leaves from our fruit trees
Much like in F1, short term financial gains drive all decisions
Apparently, that means that countries that have a ... different standard of human rights are becoming increasingly popular, as they are also emerging markets, therefore important for sponsors
Many of the decisions in top sports feel very strange to me and i wonder what my tipping point will be to lose the last bit of interest
I hate that it's in winter and I that it's in Qatar
> Many of the decisions in top sports feel very strange to me and i wonder what my tipping point will be to lose the last bit of interest
Qatar 2022 is that tipping point for me
On the domestic (skiing) front it was the whole theater of the Austrian winter tourism mafia (especially the funicular operators) during the corona pandemic, and over the last few years in general ([e.g the completely unnecessary Hinterstoder extension] The ÖSV and especially the unbelievably egomaniacal autocrat Peter Schröcknadel are highly involved in all of this (e.g. Schröcknadel owns Hinterstoder)
> I know my stance on this won't make a difference
It might, if you "infect" others with it
If you look around this comment section, you are far from the only one who is planning to boycott it

It won't be all exclusively on pay-TV anyway
Amnesty International is not a controversial source when it comes to slavery and other human rights abuses
Also, the article you linked is paywalled
Weather/climate
There were simply not as much less tasty, fresh ingredients around in the north, so people had to make do with what they had
Before we explored other parts of the world all of our food was rather bland
(As in, all of Europe)
red cabbage has always something festive to me, as it only served with good things like game, venison and better parts of beef
I really ate good everytime in Ireland
Yeah, cooked in red wine and vinegar
Well, it was mostly salmon, potatoes, parsnips and chicken
And lamb shanks
Pasta like pappardelle or most kinds of filled pasta ist easy to make though

Heiliges Römisches Reich (Holy Roman Empire)
I think in Germany you also put „..deutscher Nationen“ (..of German Nations) after it but I’ve honestly never heard somebody call it that around here
Not even textbooks
(But I may be wrong)
Now, not then
Don't confuse today's "nation" with what they understood as "nation" in 962, 1600, or 1850
The definition of nation has changed many times,  and even today there is no one clear-cut defintion
Note that it also *doesn't* mean "der Deutschen Nation", as in belonging to the German nation
it means "deutscher Nation" as in "deutscher Natur" or "deutscher Herkunft"; so, of a German  type or manner (to distinguish it from the old Roman Empire)
Well in German language (I live in Austria and I don’t really know how it is in Germany) it is extreme
Even our chancellor used the words „outdoor“ and „indoor“ last week instead of the German „draußen“ and „drinnen“.
As I said I don’t know about Germany but if there were some actions to be made it would probably need Germany for that as their are firstly the bigger country and secondly Germany has way more people that speak actual written German
In Austria most people could speak written German but hardly anyone does so as every part of Austria has dialects
I feel like people complain a lot about English loanwords
I am not the biggest fan either tbh (e.g. safe, cringe, etc)
But there isn't really a movement
I've heard "arbeit" meaning "part-time job" in Japanese anime too before
It's interesting, because we German speakers do something similar
A "Job" is most often referred to as some sort of irregular one-time work or a part-time job, while "Arbeit" refers to a full, 36-40 h/week occupation
Yeah I have no problem with Computer, Handy and so on
But if people start using safe, cringe and so one it gets very annoying
Are you aware of the phrase "menj a francba"? No offense, just curious
I thought for a long time that "hash browns" are brownies filled hashish
Turns out it's just mashed and fried potato buns
I get why they are *brown*, but the *hash* part is very confusing
Turns out one is French, and is what we call in German *Haschee*, and is probably related to *faschieren*. The other one, *hashish*, comes from Arabic
I barely/never get any words mixed up, which is surprising considering how forgetful I am
Except when I learn new words, like a year ago with sensitive/sensible
In german, sensitive is „sensibel“, often also written as „sensible“, as I‘ve seen, and sensitive is vernünftig/sinnvoll
Up until a few years ago I also really struggled with pronounciation, like I pronounced tomb and womb like bomb
Or I tried to avoid with anything I have to pronounce thorough out loud because I didn‘t even know how to start
(Now I luckily know how it’s pronounced :‘D)
Edit: and if somebody else makes a who‘s/whose error I won‘t notice it, until somebody else points it out lol
I often call a fan a ventilator
I mean come on, why would you not have a ventilator involved in ventilation
Hah, in my Austrian dialect, we also say hand instead of arm and foot instead of leg sometimes
I think it's just my specific Austrian dialect though, afaik
Saint Sebastian, our dear unfailable leader
Is Shevchenko a common name in the Ukraine or is it just coincidence that two of the most famous Ukrainians have that surname
Because idolizing Popes is inherently silly
Especially when they like John Paul II had serious problems like for example ignoring the child sexual abuse going on within the church
His legacy is not only his anticommunism,earning him the veneration of neocons for decades, but also the enabling and nurturing of a culture of denial and covering up of child diddling within the curch
A saint he aint
I hope his star burns bright and exhausts itself fast like Haiders
We don't need an amoral powerhungry twat in Power for decades only because he imitates Orban and grannys want to fuck him
Too jaded by rightwing poles really espousing that belief to not automatically belief it to be genuine
Better to zealous in pushing that back than let them pass
Ahhhh
Truly, you were right
>It doesn't seem to be as common as in surrounding countries thankfully
After reading that sentence I would have known you're Swiss without even looking at your flair
That sounds bizarre
What was the outcome
Fuck that rich dude
well, yeah, we are neutral since then
When you meaning a more direct issue, today it's cooled down, but 15 years ago the Benes decrees were a still a serious issue in our relationship with Czechia and Slovakia
for first world war, the South Tirol question flames sometimes up but it's mostly resolved since the 90's with the agreement made in the 70's, which was a pet peeve of Kreisky
Carinthia and Slovenia has also still some issues with the "Abwehrkampf", it's also more on the cold side today, but with Haiders shennenigans and the problems with the bilingual place signs Shows the issues are not buried yet
Kinda
Given the fact that we're probably about to get our second far-right government after the first one broke down due to corruption
adding salt here
Maybe he meant the Union xD
>-Faux positivity; when they post what seem to be really forced memes, pictures or stories that desperately try to push through a positive narrative but seem somewhat removed from reality (e.g. "This brave pupper guarding our airport
" or anything from /r/WholesomeMemes [the whole sub feels totally forced and contrived to me
" My apologies for not explaining this very well, but I'm a person who very much values sincerity and straightforwardness and I find myself feeling fundamentally suspicious of people who effect faux positivity
Yeah, this is the worst, that whole /r/WholesomeMemes sub in general is super shit
>E.g. "TIL Beavers won't chew on the sunny side of trees
>"DAMN IT MARK
>"Rachel that's not a toaster
>"This is why we can't enjoy our Wednesdays
Every fucking thread, all the fucking time it's exactly this shit
The only thing you forgot but kinda goes hand in hand with the faux-positivity is their relation with religion
Like how often their stories take place in churches (like in /r/TIFU : TIFU by shitting myself at church or TIFU by asking out  this cute girl at my church) and aparently it's totally normal in the US to regularly go to church even if you're otherwise normal
In my country you have to be seriously weird, old or super religious to go to church at sundays so I just can't relate
Sweet Mustard (Kremser) is the best condiment for fries - fight me
Or the general "thank me for my service" posts where suddenly someone is still in uniform or out of the blue mentions their military background unnecessarily
IIRC there was a survey/statistic posted about this topic on r/europe not so long ago
My voice is softer in german than it is in English
I'm friendlier for some reason but my personality does not change
No, I don't think it does
People get louder
For example, if you sit in a restaurant and some local comes in with a stranger and talks with him English the local is always way louder than all other people in the whole place, at least in Austria or Germany
You can easily follow the conversation even if they sit several tables away
Insecure or showing off
I don't know but it's annoying as fuck
I think I adjust my personality not for the language, but for the people to whom I have to talk to in english
too much Hollywood action movies
Or maybe you only use it for sex
:-P
Idk either, maybe I am just more polite in german

Vienna: diverse mix between traditional/imperial and modern architecture, amongst the cities with the best quality of living in the world, kind of the Austrian Berlin regarding the fact that it's a melting pot for creative people
Salzburg: Mozart, very snobby, best Austrian football club, expensive
Innsbruck: very expensive, paradise for wintersports, sorrounded by mountains, university city (population: 130k/students: about 35k)
Linz: good economy, lots of job opportunities in technical industry, boring and not beautiful
Graz: the only Austrian city where the communist party actually gets voted, also a university city, low costs of living
For linz you should've mentioned affordable

Many Carinthian surnames have Slovenian roots
Many of those typical Carinthian names have a Slovenian root, describe an area and end with -nig(g)
They have a Slovenian origin but are much more common in southern Austria than in actual Slovenia
Blatnig, Sablatnig, Wlatting, Glantschnitg, Glawischnig, Goritschnig, Hribernig, Kopeinig, Lutschounig, Poganitsch, Pototschnigg, Petutschnigg, Verschnig, Wernig etc
There are also many common Slovenian surnames that got "germanized" : Čebul -> Tschebull, Strnad -> Sternat, Šoja -> Tschojer, Čižek -> Schischegg, Černi -> Tscherne
If your surname is "Hettegger" or "Prommegger" you are probably from the valley of "Großarl".
nerdy question, but given Cristiano Ronaldo's last names which are dos Santos and Aveiro, could you pinpoint him from that as being from madeira
And if your surname is "Pfeifenberger" you are probably from the Salzburg Lungau region, especially in or near Zederhaus
Yeah, but I have read somewhere that such Slovenian names (describing a place) are more common in southern Austria than in modern day Slovenia
The interesting thing is that basically every slavic language got their names "germanized" differently
"-ig" is typical for carinthian slovene names, "-ek" for czech ones, and "-itsch" is for south slavic ones
There is probably also some system for the "-ich" ones but I dont know it
Edit: Burgenland Croatian names seem to have "-its" for most, "-itz" for others and "-ich" for a few ones
I don't hope so
I'm German and I've lived in Austria for the past three years
I love it here, especially in Vienna, and I don't plan on returning to Germany anytime soon
Been living in Vienna for 5 years now
It’s allright, but I subjectively can’t see myself spending my whole life here
It simply feels foreign and not like home
However, Romania doesn’t either anymore
I don’t exclude moving back, but I would rather try another European country in the near future before that
Moved in Austria 2 years ago
No intention of going back
Maybe going further west, but not back

That's basically the German "One, two, three, Freddy's coming for you" just without Freddy
I understand two words out of those and not one of them translates to "darn".
*esta viejo y podrido
*ser* is for general properties (i.e. the cheese has always been bad and also has had a long and fulfilling life and is enjoying its retirement now)
*estar* is for states and temporal properties (the cheese has gotten old and smelly)
the best way to remember it: Soy ciego = I am blind
Estoy ciego = I am way too drunk ("blind")
My mom taught me that one
Edit: she didn't use it on me - she just told me that they used it in their childhood

No idea how that was chosen, I guess the country of Mozart, Schubert and Bruckner has had a long fall from grace
The worst part though is that I and my friends used to sing that in elementary school, fun times
Austria has the honour of being the first country ever to officially end up in last place
This was in the 1957 Eurovision song contest, which was only the second one in history and the first one using a public points system
We got a total of 3 pity points for [Bob Martin's "Wohin, kleines Pony
"] The song actually isn't that awful, mind you, especially considering that we've had much much worse ones since then
I remember that the 1991 entry, [Thomas Forstner's "Venedig im Regen"] was considered to be a real stinker by everyone around here
It was a horrible song, and the singer didn't even manage to stay on key
Zero points, and rightly so
(Also, that hair
That outfit

this song makes me cringe
Don't forget about Alf Poier "Weil der Mensch zählt". Hilarious

Yeah,german party Songs in the early 2010s sure were

They were actually in their early 20s
Flashback to a few years ago when germany sent in a [weeb girl] on a dark and mysterious stage, but then she sung
a super boring ballad
Like, what was up with that
Did they chicken out in the last board meeting or what
No and I‘ve never heard of that /:
What‘s it about tho
I wanna know now
And where is this primarily worn
And when
This right here
It's quite perverse for certain peoples if you think about it
The Irish, Finns, Georgians, Ukrainians and many more were essentially forced to fight in a war for nations that were suppressing them and actively tried to eradicate their culture against nations that may have given them independence
In Austria its the polar opposite, we still got traditional groups dressed up as soldiers from WWI doing some epic stuff on our streets, but then again we didn‘t have our imperial flag from WWI plagued by Neo Nazis
IMO there should be a remembrance day for both WWI and WWII soldiers in germany, but it‘s probably gonna get ruined by neo nazis again aswell
We don‘t learn much about WWI either, my education about WWI was literally this and I quote: „About 20 Million people died, now let‘s move onto WWII“
It's a difficult topic for sure
The involvement in the war itself is universally seen as bad though, there's no real argument about that
What is occasionally grey is the manner of annexation
Should we have fought back after Britain, Italy and France refused to help under any circumstances already
I'm heavily leaning on yes, we should have
Even if just to prove the guarantees of peace of the victorious powers of WW1 for the sham they really were
The most important question is if a majority of Austrians really wanted the annexation or not
And that is a really difficult question to answer, since there's legitimate evidence and arguments for both yes and no
European unity is a good concept in principle, but the same doesn't apply to imperialist powers of the past who tried to push the perceived supremacy of their culture and language on the people they subjugated
I mean, just look at Ireland, their language was almost eradicated
So separatism can of course be justified if it's against an actual oppressor
And let's be fair, most minorities in the early 20th century had fair reason to separate from their respective countries
Ah, nice to know
Germans usually like Austrians, Austrians generally dislike Germans
At least that's my experience
Non-answer: Hard to say, because within these two countries there are plenty differences too
Germans are not all similar (eg
Bavaria vs Bremerhaven), and neither are Austrians
Vienna is where the devil found his equal
Nuff said
"What divides Austria and Germany is their shared language
It's
Tüte / Sackerl
Aubergine / Melanzani
Wiener Würstchen / Frankfurter
I, for myself, think that the language is connecting the two countries
Also the food quality seems to be better in Austria
I've heard many people complain about German supermarkets
Germany is a lot more "culturally Western European" than Austria; the only exception is Bavaria
We share quite a bit with them, but those similarities are more pronounced in the western, alpine part of Austria
Germans cannot make schnitzel to save their life and they are generally less open to arguments in a fun/casual way
Everything is very intense with them and I feel they are more extreme
The Austrian German is different (and way better) than the Germany german
And We have a particular fondness for blaming the germans for everything
I came to this thread expecting anything from stupid clichees, worn-out Anschluss and Hilter jokes, to people claiming that there's absolutely no difference at all
This is by far the most accurate description
“Wenn I amoi stirb, stirb, stirb
soin mi Fiaker trogn, und dabei Zithern schlogn
austria has only been part of Germany for 6 years in its history
The rest of Austrias history it hasn't.
Historically sure it could have developed with austria being part of germany, but it didn't. No other region of german speaking people had this development, because austria was part of the strong habsburger monarchy and because of politics etc austria just didnt become a part of germany when they formed in the 19th century
And that left a mark on austrians
Austria is the most unique German speaking region in all of the german speaking regions in europe, hence it being it's own country
Ooh look at me, I'm a Brit and I'm hitting se nail in se head
Yes
I was looking for this comment
Waltz is very accurate in his assessment

We tend to characterize it as "relationships before rules".

We gave you the guy that killed Hitler too
You're welcome
So what concretely makes Austria "small Germany" and e.g. Switzerland or Luxembourg not

He is right though (generally, of course)
> Those traits sound very specific and personal and impossible to generalise over entire countries
Height is very specific and personal, yet we can certainly generalize it
It's called statistics
I live quite near the border to germany and have contact to both friends/family in rural and urban areas in either countries and telling from my experience, it's absolutely true
Especially when talking to strangers, I could be joking with a shop assistant in Linz, but I wouldn't really do that in even a small villiage like Windorf

Danke für die Information
Das wusste ich noch nicht
No it is not the same
Frankfurter Würstl are made from beef and pork
AFAIR These were created by someone from Frankfurt in Vienna, where butchers weren't split in the beef and the pork kind (whereas in Frankfurt they were which made the Frankfurter Würstl illegal in Frankfurt at the time)
I guess when this type of sausage made its way back to Germany it came from Vienna, hence called Wiener there (or Wienerli in Switzerland)
Wait who is more direct for you
Well no considering Austrian cuisine has a lot of Balkan foods .
Sorry, I didn't want to imply a "German cultural homogenization" at all

holy Roman empire is not germany
Czech, Slovakians,... not german

Gonna need a source on that, buddy

Austria has several official languages
Ich bin ein Berwiener, oder so
Care to explain why you think some of us don't like you
Germans are generally seen as more arrogant and brash, doesn't help that high german is a rather hard language, compared to the dialects spoken in Austria
Alright then, no worries
I've never seen that video, herrlich, Bierbauch vorraus, danke dafür!
There's even a song about how much nicer Vienna would be if everyone would die there:
I'm not saying austria doesnt have a shared history with germany
It obviously does
I just specified in my original comment that it only was part of germany for 6 years
I know Germany has many different people
The narratives that austrians pretend to not be germans is also very insulting
Even just the standard Germany-German dialect (which a lot of Germans claim to be no dialect but "proper" German) sounds overly formal and slightly rude to a lot of Austrians
Which is a weird insult to be honest
If you shit exclusively on a mountaintop it would end up downhill anyways
I somewhat doubt that tabloid article as I'm not sure how/if a slavic expression about a place/mountain in Styria would have carried over centuries into modern German
My suspicion of the term still being popular is more along the lines of the word transporting a feeling of "closed in by mountains" as well as helplessness and laziness
Something like "Already surrounded by mountains and nothing better to do than staying down in that ravine and taking a shit".
Well, a viral marketing group tried to stage someone stealing the top of the Zugspitze a few years back:
Its nearer to the colloquially German name, so yea I do
In Austria, we just call it "Tschechien" anyway, although some also call it "Tschechei", so I think it wouldn't be that bad
Yeah, because we say something similar in German already (Tschechien), so you really notice how unwieldy it is having to resort to "Czech Republic" in English in comparison
There is a dated German name for the Czech Republic, *Tschechei* which is more similar to Czechia
Ah, similarly to what we call "Tschechei" (area name) as opposed to "Tschechien" (the country)
Thanks for your comment
> Tschechei
I always thought that Tschechei is just the name for the region (Čechy) as opposed to the whole nation
As such, it has a strong "austro-hungarian empire" undertone, because it was used back then when you'd talk about the area (like "Böhmen and Mähren"), and not the country
I always considered it slightly problematic for that reason, because it's denying the Czech people its own nation, or at least not caring that things have changed since then
locally and to me personally, I'd say it has slightly historical and dialectal connotations, old people might use it more often than younger ones, and less educated ones more often than highly educated ones
I can attest that it's super common among Viennese workers and in certain regions of Lower Austria (Waldviertel etc
), nowadays used with the meaning of "Czech Republic".
eh, that's just the illogical nature of exonyms everywhere
why is Germany's name in other languages derived from so many different tribes that lived in the area (Germans, Saxons, etc), but none of them are fully grasping or including all historical peoples in their name for the country
I know you jest, but to still give a countertpoint: if a country is not lobbying for and offering a practical name for itself in other languages, it shouldn't wonder when people will find their own, incorrect terms instead
Unitedstatesofamerica -> America, Unitedkingdom -> England, Côte d'Ivoire -> no thanks we'll stick to the local one that we know how to pronounce
I can only agree
I barely hear people say Tschechei
wtf nazi connotations
it has *austro-hungarian empire* connotations, and is the name of certain area, not the country
not seen as particularly tactful in the same way as calling romanian towns by their historical german names
also it's common in eastern austria, and has a strong dialectal/slightly historical connotation there
people with lower education, older people, and people from certain dialectal regions will often say Tschechei instead of Tschechien
Lol, never even noticed that, but you are right
That *is* a lot of consonants
It's because of the two sch mostly
In German you are so used seeing it as one unit, one sound
It doesn't even register as three separate consonants for me and how unwieldy it can make a word look
my experience is vastly [different] Wiener Arbeitermilieu bzw
Waldviertel
it's honestly just because of sch, which is ʃ
Gives me a Mordor-y vibe
I like it
Yes and no
It's true, it's supposed to look like a castle/city walls (has windows and all), and that is maybe also a hint at the CoA of Castilla, but it is at the same time still a crown
This heraldic element is called "[mural crown] and is a typical symbol burgués and/or republican
Basically it means the citizens themselves (the bricks) are the souvereign, not a royal
Can also be seen in our [CoA]
The black-red-golden tricolore in this form stems from liberation wars against Napoleon and can be attributed at least since 1815
The use of the colors itself is of course much much older and is based on the colors of teh CoA of the HRE
Hm I have never thought about it, but this seems to get along well with Ironie, Sarkasmus and Zynismus triplet, also ascending in malignity
German (which has an unbelievable amount of dialects, but there are main dialects for every state so the basic number is 16), Austrian-German (fun fact: Austria has so many different dialects that they‘re not countable
I always learn new words for different things
I have a friend who lives 15 minutes away and she doesn’t even know some words I use lmao
But there are also main dialects for every state, so 9
) and Swiss-German (which has probably just as many different dialects)
The South Tyrols in Italy have a different dialect too and I wouldn‘t be surprised if Liechtensteiners also all have different regions with different dialects, despite its size
Having dialects in my language is so basic to me that I‘m more surprised if a language _doesn‘t_ have big differences between regions
As a non-native Russian speaker I can only confirm this
I talked to many people from European and Asian regions - I understand them all to the same extend
I never once had the thought 'wow, that Asian guy is difficult to understand', they speak the same way somebody from Petersburg does
I think it's noteworthy that in Austrian constitution the Slovenian language (alongside others) is protected and that this paragraph was taken over from the monarchy times
So repression of the Slovenian language was not a constant over time
Also nationalism as we understand it today is a relatively new concept
In the middle ages and early reconnaissance, people who lived in one village didn't understand the ones of the next anyway so people often used Latin or French and nationality was less defined by your ethnicity than rather by your lord
So countries with mixed ethnicity where quite normal back at that time and some of them like Belgium still exist to this day
With that in mind as a Styrian I feel proud about my mixed heritage
I don't see my culture as something Germanic/Baviarian but the product of centuries of intermingling and coexistence of Slavic and Germanic culture and several words in our dialect has Slovenic roots, although there are too many who think it is important to crowbar those things cultures from each other and I also feel sorry for the damage nationalism did to our slovenian brothers and sisters by shaming their language
well, the Russians made very sure that the colonization works and had very strict language programs in every single village
At least that's how it was explained to me
Oh thank you, that is very interesting
Funny enough, we have such a person as well, he writes books though and is called Bastian Sick, also lots of wrong claims and explanations but people are so into him
If you start correcting somebody people will think you are super smart no matter how much bs in your arguments is
Says a Spanish person :P
There is the old saying: "The whole world leads war, but you Austria just marry". The reason for this was that the Habsburgs collected their Lands not by force for the most part, but by marrying their numerous daughters to lords and kings so that after 1-2 Generations it came into their possession through inheritance
So basically they practiced make love not war, before it was cool and more successful
Vienna: tourism, art, music, probably historians (like tbh any other European city), Sachertorte
Salzburg: music probably (maybe some art and historians too
Innsbruck: Winter tourism
Around here Graz is said to be the city of Tech and Vienna the city of Universities and stuff, but idk if it‘s just in my federal state or nationwide
Linz: Heavy industry, steel etc
Ferlach: Guns
Vienna: everything (politics, commerce, culture, research)
Linz: heavy industry and some biotech
Graz: car industry/mechanical engineering in general and mining, research in those areas
Salzburg: tourism, culture
Klagenfurt, Innsbruck: summer and winter tourism (K more summer, I more winter)
Bregenz: don't know, have never been
Eisenstadt and especially St
Pölten: sleeper towns to Vienna
Really
Guns
Probably Glock's?
Mainly yes
But also winter sports fans
I would say skiing is definitely the biggest reasin, but there are other sports as well
And imagine doing a spa weekend while there is snow outside and you are looking out onto the mountains
Or taking a walk in the snow
Going to Christmas markets etc
Lots of things to do in winter
I've been to Eisenstadt once
I think they are a bit for tourism
>Guns
Probably Glock's?
No, Ferlach has been a "Büchsenmacherstadt" for about 400 years before Glock was founded
Ferlacher Guns are known world wide
There is even a gun and a target on the city's [coat of arms] The HTBLA Ferlach is also a famous school for gun smithing
Didn't know that
Thanks
I would say Biontech/Pfizer for Austria while Biontech is mostly put in the first place
Sometimes only Biontech
Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Croatian (and Serbian
), Slovenian, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian
If I didn't forget anything
Spanish, Italian, English, German, Polish, French and danish
German, Dutch, French, Italian, Russian, English, Austrian Dialect (that counts
), Greek, Spanish
Not to say I speak all these languages, but travelling and meeting people helps with basic like "helo", "please" and "thank you". just to be polite
streber lol
Haha, maybe this is the last big mystery that language beholds for me :D
Haha I actually knew it at some point
I was once in Lithuania and tried to learn some phrases, but all I still remember is Dziugas :D
I am not sure about these - I never was in these countries
I mean, of course everybody would understand Russian or could be a native Russian speaker, but I don't know by heart what 'thanks' is on Ukrainian or Belorussian
oh very cool, thank you :)
Mrs
Worldwide :D
Remembering a German coffee roasters advertised ther new sorts available with "Jedem das seine". Well it means each his own/Suum cuique but this was also written on the entrance of Buchenwald
After the German Jewish comitee complained they removed the ad
Yeah I'd bet they thought of the U2 song without knowing the background to it
You know what the lyrics of that song are about
The only thing I even know about Singapore is that there are quite high fines when you litter
That's it
tiger state, government agencies that work in a very efficient and streamlined manner (everything's offered in multiple languages, things get done quickly, many things can be done online), lots and lots of aircon, clean parks, clean main roads and seedy back alleys, first intelligent city toll system with automatic toll adjustment depending on area/time, awesome new airport, interesting green building exteriors, huge replanting effort to save the trees that had to be moved during some alleyway construction, funny accent and "no pok
" video guy, polite politicians, mahjong, a girl I met that came from there that had *never* been to a proper forest in her *life* before (we went hiking in Japan, climbed a mountain and she asked where the peak was, because she couldn't find the "this is the recommended spot for selfies" sign), cheap and good tailors, kopi tiam and nice noodle dishes, conflict with indonesia about air quality
It's easy for travelers who want to see a big Asian city but are afraid/unexperienced in travelling, because of it's Britsh influence
Clean and safe
I did a two night stopover on my way to Australia
I **really** liked the night zoo
had a stop there when i went to down under
nice airport, impossibly clean
not much else to say, it was only 6 hours
Clean and authoritarian
I heard that chewing gum is prohibited there
Is this true
A song by german Pop singer Markt Forster called "Au Revoir".
Ich brauch Freiheit, ich geh auf Reisen
Ich mach alles das, was ich verpasst hab
Fahr mit 'nem Gummiboot bis nach Alaska
Ich spring in *Singapur* in das kalte Wasser
Ich such das Weite und dann tank ich neue Kraft da
Which roughly translates to:
I need freedom, I go on trips
I do all that things that I missed
Travel by a rubber boat to Alaska
I spring into cold water in *Singapore*
I look into the distance and then I tank new power
Lol, somehow I've heard this only from germans, never from my own countrymen
People who lived through WW2 and the following occupation always told me that gaining independence was the best thing that could have happend
Edit: It is true that after WW1 a majority of people living in the new state auf Austria were in favor of joining Germany
This was due to the fact that the empire they belonged to vanished without a trace, leaving them with no sense of belonging other than a linguistic belonging to the German language family
But why
What could be so bad about chewing gum that they thought they have to ban it
The SA and SS helped you vote and it was far from a secret ballot
It is possible that the Nazis would have won nevertheless but thats what happens when a Nation offers thousands of jobs to an austerity ridden nation (thanks mises you prick)
Austria ‚conquered‘ huge territories and partnered up with many powerful allies by marrying family into royal houses throughout the world since the late middle ages
Known as „Habsburger Heiratspolitik“. Their motto was „war may do the others - you, oh lucky Austria, marry
“. The irony was strong on this one, as Austria was horribly bad at warfare
We even accidentally fought our own men during war agains the ottomans
Wiener ("Viennese") sausages are only called so outside of Austria
We call them Frankfurter
If I may take a guess from which country you‘re from: Greece
Why is it controversial; because of the cost
Hard to believe
hello,
you should be tortured forever
have a nice day
also r/Schnitzelverbrechen
Barbarians
The whole lot of you
(and yeah, you really know how to trigger us Austrians
Yeah, that's so funny
It's probably one of the biggest honors in chemistry/physics to have an element named after you
And then there's this small town that has *four* named after it, in some unoriginal way :D
afaik that used to be the case, but they stopped, and the tunnel should be the replacement
No, that stands for "All the world is subject to Austria" (Alles Erdreich ist Österreich untertan or Austriae est imperare orbi universo)
But it was also an Austrian Motto, I think at a different time though
I know we were just talking about sausages, but I'm not a guy
What you call a [Wiener] we call a Frankfurter
What you call a Frankfurter, we call a Frankfurter
Basically there's no distinction by ingredients here, and if you buy a Frankfurter in Austria it could be anything from pure pork, to pork and beef, to chicken or turkey
The German name for this type of dough is simply Plunder
The version of it that is used in Denmark seems to be slightly different as to the ratio of ingredients that are used, and pastries made with the Danish variant of the dough would apparently be called "Kopenhagener Gebäck" according to Wikipedia, but I've honestly never heard that before
(I'm guessing it's probably simply too similar to the mainstream Plunder dough pastries here, and it wouldn't catch on from a commercial standpoint to have something that's almost but not quite the same)
I only had the hugs awards but have it anyway because I agree
Joking about how miserable you are whilst actually really being hurt on the inside
Anyone from Vienna could get gold in that sport easily

I wanna say we'd probably only win because it involves drinking beer
The Czechs would be a good opponent probably
Make 10 New ski alpin disciplines so we can finally rival the Norwegians with their 100 cross-country skiing disciplines
(Swiss would approve as well)
I swear, there is no possible way to scan all product throwing items over the counter this quickly
I knew someone would suggest sudern
Our battle will be legendary
We just are
Death is inevitable, and life is pointless, other than leaving as pretty a corpse as possible
Well, that is because you aren't supposed to
Haha sure, just wanted to exaggerate
Thanks for the explanation anyway
You might meet lots of older people working too fast for them to put it away, i assume
And are you annoyed when someone picks out coins to pay exactly or dont you care
I remember that time
Those were machines
Okay, this is not gonna be as strange as the other comments, but we have the DAÖ, a party that was created because a few politicians thought it was unfair for another politician to get kicked out of his party for being corrupt, so they created the DAÖ.
Well we have a beer party
In the last election a party called BPÖ (Beer Party of Austria) ran for seats in Vienna
I think their program is rather self explanatory
And here I thought Boris Johnson had a few more votes
Well, between that, Jobbik and Fidesz
i mean, we're hardly one to talk but your political landscape right now is barking mad
I would accept Anschluss if that means I can vote for Die Partei
Please explain

Waiting for some hungarian to comment: would be even bigger if your people wouldn't have shot some austrian dude
So you are saying there's only 6 big countries out of over a hundred
[The projections on maps lie]
Only in long distance trains, not in regional ones
We do, in the trains through bigger cities
But in the ones everywhere else, no
We have them in Railjet trains (high speed trains), but (unfortunately) nobody gave a shit and I think a lot of people did not notice
Now they improved the signs, it is color coded in green and says "Ruhebereich", something you really cannot unsee
It works better than before, but it would be nice if the reservation system would have sort of a checkbox system, if you are travelling with a kid etc
It is in my opinion rather pointless, to have screaming kids in every coach
It would be much better if there was something like special family coach in each train, space for buggys and bikes
In Salzburg, the quiet areas were also tested in regional trains
But unfortunately everyone ignored it
Not to forget the family zone which is the complete opposite of quiet
Salzburg
A bit too much tourists but a beautiful city for sure
Vienna
Has a bit of "big international city" flair, but is actually not all too big
And the public transport is fantastic
Funny to see this pop up here, I've been to Kerteminde efterskole (not as a student)
So basically you're a Northerner, regardless of the country you're in
Especially Norway
Norway has a lot of North
Almost all of Norway consists of North
<3 from grumpy Vienna
When I started travelling to other cities when I was younger, I was so surprised to see how people interacted both with me and among each other
At first I thought it was a specific city where people were so ridiculously friendly, bzt then I realized that no, it's actually us, we are the outlier
Now I'm back though, and thank god, can't stand those smiling assholes
How is the overall Meme culture in your native language
Do you prefer them or English memes
Are there some special meme formats used more in your language/country other than what's "hot"?
r/okoidawappler
I hate german memes in general, the only exceptions are political memes in r/Austria or r/aeiou specifically made for us
Other than that english memes only
There are some good memes but yeah
Most german / austrian memes are rather bad
I have to say I think german memes are awful
There are some more meme pages on Facebook that are not that bad but still overall I don't really enjoy them
Sometimes there are some diamonds in the rough but you'll have to dig in my opinion
I only look at my subscribed stuff, so I dont have that problem
...what would be cool though is if there would be a cooking related sub, thats not 99% American
I couldnt even get the ingredients
r/chefkoch ;)
Hmm
r/KochenundKulinarik hätte Potential
I dont know, most of the ingredients I dont even know
Often its some texmex stuff, Ive never heard of and I really doubt its buyable in my city
And I somehow dont like the idea of ordering food from the internet - I am just not that much invested
For cups you have [these things] to measure
Usually you can get it at kitchen supply stores
Yeah, but maybe thats the American influence
Altough I bought recently an Italian cooking book and almost everything included tons of oil and cheese
I didn't expect that at all
Still healthier than 5 gallons of it
KZ Mauthausen, without a doubt
The day long hiking trip in last elementary school year (from Gaberl to großer Speik and back)
Open air museum Stübing (old farm buildings)
Graz guided tour, we went in a tunnel and came out inside the clock tower, cool the see it once from the inside)
A salt mine and a lead/zinc mine
Bird of prey show in Landskron
We did the Cool trips above all in elementary school
The other were:
Kaprun Hydropower plant
Mellach coal power plant
Yeah, we never were in a KZ
KZ Mauthausen and the nuclear power plant in Temelin
None
In elementary school there were some day-trips but nothing really memorable
And for high school we didn't really do any single-day field trips
Almost everything that was planned got cancelled for us
I can remember some trips with music class to concerts and one to the opera, but that was only some hours and I wouldn't consider it field trips
Also not very memorable
There was a hiking trip in maybe grade 7, but all I can remember is watching Scream on the bus, and some vague things about building a shelter in the woods and doing some team building exercises
I usually got quite a good memory for things like that but seems like nothing was really that memorable
I remember a lot about multi-day trips though
Same
The room with the books with all the names of the people who died there
Scary
>yes, for me too
I was going to say the same thing
We never did that
Every year we would have done a trip the teachers were on strike
Same here
Just being inside certain rooms made me feel ill
School, peers, siblings, parents, the internet (and I mean the whole internet, not only porn
E.g. I just looked up lots of stuff on wikipedia when I was a teen, but maybe I just was really dorky
), youth organizations
some really basic things from my parents, not as a "talk" though, but just as an honest answer to questions I was asking
only some of them are slightly cringey in hindsight, mostly I'm glad it went this way
we had proper sex ed in school of course, but back then (90ies on the countryside) it was kinda lame
kids nowadays have it better, recently saw that they have a "project week" where they'll learn about that stuff from various angles for a week, with lots of room to talk among each other with teachers, ask questions and also talk privately, divided by gender and all together; I found that was really really awesome
Like seriously, I think the importance "the talk" with the parents is blown way out of proportion, especially considering how most parents don't even know how to appoach the topic themselves
And the influence of peers and older siblings (in my case my two older sisters had "the talk" - i.e. penis, vagina, condoms, kinds of sex, you know, the ABC of sex - with me, without the parents, on a long car drive when I was 11) is way underrated
Not because those younger people know more about the topic, but because they are curious themselves, and kids can talk about sex stuff more openly with someone more or less their own age
Because puberty is a bitch, and parents suck
^/s
That said, the importance of good sex ed, where the facts are being set straight, can't be overstated
And that doesn't only concern biology teachers, but all teachers
History, social studies, languages, maybe even maths (like, learning how the pearl index works), or chemistry
Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia, is slowly but steadily growing and given how close it is to Austria, they are now building directly at the border (district: Nesto)
It's conceivable that - even tho some Austrian towns aren't too keen on being submerged - Bratislava will most likely grow into Austria
What makes this truly unique tho is the fact that Vienna, Austria's capital, is actually pretty close to the border as well
They are less than 60km apart
So maybe in the distant future we'll see something like a twin or duo capital city
There is an Austrian-Cuban- and Austrian-North Korean friendship society
It is not officially connected to the state, but some well known politicians are members of one of them
For example former president Heinz Fischer was Board member for the Austrian-North Korean-Friendship society before he was president
I think Austria is one of the few European countries that have a North Korean embassy and for example North Korean passports are printed by the same company that prints austrian passports (company is owned by the state)
And there was a strong connection between Jörg Haider, former Gouverneur of carinthia, and Saddam Hussein and Muammar Al gaddaffi, from Libya, with whom it is said that he was good friends
I honestly couldn't find any information how that happened
Austria and Australia
American post offices keep sending parcels to Australia instead of Austria
We know what you are talking aboot
This is probably the reason why the ship linking the two cities is called Twin City Liner
Or Im just stupid, that's also a possibility
Well it also mentions Austria, but let's not talk about that
Beautifully said
Let's give it time
Slovakia's economy is coming along well
Maybe it will get more attention once it's considered "fully developed" in most people's minds
Heast deppata, s'eh kloa dass des da Grund is
Wos redstn do so gschissn daher
Translation: You're probably right
Good observation
Yeah and that'll stall the process for a while which is why I don't see it happening for some time
But on the other hand the average salary in Bratislava is already on par with the Austria average and higher than in the rural areas nearby
At some point there'll be an economic pull effect
Probably to some extent, but there's free movement between us
I don't think it would be negative if Bratislava grew into Austria
I think Austrians would benefit from the business
Austria thinks the lake belongs to everybody, Switzerland wants clear borders and Germany doesn't care I think
Yes, Vienna is well known to have a lot of international spies and intelligence activities due to Austria being a neutral country and being located between East (USSR) and west (Nato)
Further more there are some big organisations such as uno, opec and iaea, that have offices here
Im not sure if that's the only reason, but it definitely contributes to the whole picture
The difference is that Slovenia and Slovakia are only about 370km away from each other, while it's 14200km between Austria and Australia
That means that parcels and letters will take a lot longer
Oida danke, bist a Hawara
Lass ihn dir schmecken, mein Freund
I feel honoured
I just said said "enjoy your apple, my friend" lol
For me it was le chat mange un pomme rouge
So my mom is Polish, my dad is Austrian, me and my brother were born and raised in Austria and both barely know any Polish (=almost not at all), because my dad prohibited us learning Polish because he thought kids weren‘t able to be raised bilingual and if me and my brother were raised that way we wouldn‘t know „proper German“ (as if he is the one that isn’t even able to write a whole sentence in perfect Standard German and always has to ask us two, usually me, to write one
Before this turns into a rant of my dad: I usually say I‘m Austrian, because I barely know any Polish and was born here
If people were to ask me, of course I‘d say that I‘m half Polish too
And if I were to ever pick up Polish again (I tried learning it for like 4 times but I‘m at the point were every other language I learned/tried to learn, Korean included, is easier to understand for me than Polish so yeah
) and actually know how to speak it a little bit I‘d identify with both too, but at the moment not really
Alright, I'm both an Italian and a German citizen but I live in the home country of my grandmother: Austria
If you ask about my national identity I'd say that I consider myself both Italian and German but more than anything I identify with being European
I’m not really in the situation you described, however, I have a very strong connection to Iceland (I’m from Austria)
Reason for that is that my fathers ex-wife is Icelandic and their children, my two half brothers, live in Iceland and I have a very good and close relationship with them, I even speak Icelandic and go there several times a year
A guy ate a sandwich after failing at his job
But Finland still lost
I know the Soviets had a lot of casualties, but still
Who would win:
Some yeety Czechy bois OR 1/3rd of Central Europe
Pyrrhic victory means a win that was a loss
I personally don't see how Russia lost
lmao what is this shit
We learned in school that the French word for "to kiss" is "baiser".
Well
Seems there was a slight shift in meaning happening after our teachers' graduation
Well I wouldn't say "whom" is not used, it's just less frequent
For example you might say:
"Pass it along to whomever you see fit", "Whom is your inquirey addressed to
Which technically is different than how it would've been used a century ago (where the preposition "to" would often be omitted, also it would never appear at the end of a sentence as that was considered poor grammar)
At least in North America, the usage of the word is still going strong
I do lament, however, the loss of the words "hither" and "thither" which are not only fun to say but convey meaningful information that we have to now express in two words "over here", "over there".
This seems to be common with German speaking teachers
"In English, people are much more polite than they are here, so always use *please* and *thank you* when asking for something
" Then I went to the UK and got greeted with an *Oi, move outta way cunt
* in line at the airport
What's a deutscherin supposed to be
Really
Wow
No, they taught us that in the 1980s ... too bad I don't have my old books anymore, I guess they would be a hoot for you guys
Well, English dialects evolved in pretty different directions
From personal experience, I'm mostly used to the Pacific Northwest (where I have family and spent a lot of time) but hearing other dialects, esp
from British Isles, I often have to strain my ears
I really like the Irish dialect though, especially with phrases using terms from Gaellic like "what's the craic"!
I have had italian for 3 years in school and never even heard about egli or ella
Oh, now I do see ...goddamn lol
"...aber, Pronto
Really
I've never actually heard anyone use kuseng before
Mostly people seem to say 'kusö(n)'
I think Vienna/Wien is the only Austrian city with a different English name
Honestly, Vienna kinda sounds better to me
Otherwise, most bigger Austrian cities don't have particularly nice names
Neither Graz nor Linz sounds particularly good to me
Of course, we got the well-known village of „Fucking“ in Austria
They seriously contemplated changing the name, because they had to replace the name-plate so many times
german pronunciation is obviously the same, except the „u“ sound is without the „j“ sound in English
Then we got places like „Mösendorf“, which roughly means „Pussyvillage“.
Or „Froschen“ and „Schweinern“ which mean „Frog-en“ and „Pig-ing“
And sometimes ppl must have been just lazy, bc you come across the occasional „Dorf“ which means simply „village“.
>Brno
Did you know that Brno is the Czech transkription of Brünn which was the original German name
Wenceslaus I of Bohemia settled German experts there to modernize the Agriculture
He was half Czech half German and did a lot for Czechia
Brno was long time home to German speaking Czechs for nearly thousand years
But back to your original question:
Vienna (= Wien in German)
Graz (this name has Slovenian origin it losely translates to Settling)
Klagenfurt (originally Furt der Klagen which means "Valley of Lament")
[Fucking]
Thal (German old word for Valley; birth place of Arnold Shwarzenegger)
Salzburg (Salt castle in German)
German speakers should pronounce it right too
We stretch the o much more than English does
The german version of Oradea is Großwardein (=big was your)
Pretty amusing
And then there is ...
5121, Austria
open the "o"
The entirety of Burgenland
Some communities try to pay people to settle there
Most of vienna thinks austria has 415km² and has about 2 million inhabitants so a viennese will most likely answer everything outside of vienna
Otherwise it is the burgenland or the austro-czech border
Basically anywhere that isn't Vienna, a but less so in the other bigger cities
Idk, we're pretty dense populated
I'd guess in the middle of a giant forest
Burgenland
Yeah, but some parts of upper Styria feel also so desolate
Rosegger Waldheimat felt really like in middle of nowhere while I was there and that's not even the most  desolate part of it
I don't get why though it's a really nice place to live in
The Waldviertel in Lower Austria too
Lots of forest (=wald), nots of people
Wildalpen it is
Waldviertel kinda as well
But they're trying
Historical reasons still
Burgenland's entire infrastructure was directed towarss Sopron and Szombathely, so after 1918/1945 it went to shit and they would have needed to build new infrastructure but didn't for a long fucking time
So people left and weren't replaced
We use to jokingly say that it's actually Hungary
Just talked about Jämtlandstriangeln with someone yesterday ;) but I get your point, Lappland is definitely internationally known
Lots of people tend to stay close to where they grew up
I feel like many tend to stay with their parents in the countryside and only way later move out to a big city because their job is there
However some never move to the city, especially farmers kids who tend to continue their parents farms
Idk what it is but I feel like  many people are born on the countryside and move to the city because easier access to everything
Idk how the wide countryside of Austria is still alive because it seems like nobody moves there, country people just suddenly exist, but it is
I also have to note that I live on the countryside with my parents, so I may be biased
Please correct me if I‘m wrong
// Also it should be noted that a good percentage of Austrians live in Vienna
I think almost 2 million out of ~9 million people
Still, "Landflucht" is a very big Problem for smaller villages
Lots of people move to the cities
I would not say that this applies everywhere
There are many quite rural regions that managed to build up some remarkable industries that keep even well educated workers in small villages
"Warning: falling cows"
(it's usually just the symbol, but that's its meaning)
Or especially at the nicest most romantic small alpine villages at the bathing places at the river there is a warning sign for flash floods and a wave as high as a man drawn
Not specifically a sign but many signs combined
Close to where I live there is/was an intersection where every year some people died
The first time I drove there it was during night
At first you see huge reflecting signs that say "Warning, deadly intersection ahead". Then your car gets shaken because they put grooves in the asphalt so you are alarmed
Then you see like 10 crosses of the accident-victims next to the road and then you see 2 huge stop-signs on both sides of the road
All this during a foggy night combined with the crosses of the dead was pretty creepy
Fun fact: i spoke to a farmer because i'd noticed a burnt spot on one of the meadows high up and he just casually said "yeah a cow took a fall and we had to burn it right there
I have seen that in Austria too
Much less then in the US for example but if you go hiking off the tourist trails it’s quite common to see street signs with billet holes in them
The greater good
> if any cattle end up chasing us we should be fine
You won't be
Could be both, but it is usually at the high-up pastures or more specifically the sign is put at road's passing at the lower end of a cliff and cows are grazing at the upper end at the high alp
Sometimes they come to close to the edge while grazing or slip and fall
Carry an umbrella
In all seriousness: drive carefully (i.e. always being able to brake to a standstill within your field of vision/ half your field of vision on a narrow road), and keep an eye on the road for dead animals or rocks
The danger is not so much that you get hit (that's just bad luck, and there's nothing you can do about it; but what are the odds ...), but that you hit something that has already fallen and is now blocking the road (can be avoided)
I mean what else is he gonna do
The only alternative would be to leave it for the vultures, which probably would be best
Yeah, that would be better i guess
But from what I've heard it's not that easy doing that in Austria
Typical Austrian overregulation and bureaucracy
The vultures might get sick you know
Not at all, really
I was surprised that we play it at all, to be honest
Not popular at all
There's at least 10-15 more popular sports here, I never hear any reports about it and don't really know anyone playing it
You surely mean you buy  preserved milk  (instrad of standard fresh, pasteurized, milk, which is always in in the refrigator aisle in any supermarket) in France and then put that one in the fridge
Or do you mean you only buy the eggs non-refrigerated
Eggs I put on the fridge,
The raw or pasteurization milk I put always in the fridge, the condensed/coffee milk and the plant milks only when they are open
Yes, both go in the fridge
I've never seen it any other way
Yes to both, though for the eggs mainly because I don't have counter space so the fridge is just convenient for them to put away in ;)
I keep eggs and milk in the fridge
My grandmother doesn't keep eggs in the fridge
I don't buy UTH milk so yes, the milk definitely goes into the fridge
Eggs, no
They are sold unrefrigerated and they stay that way at home
Eggs, milk and cheese
My in-laws don't refrigerate eggs, but keep them in a cooler pantry
How could you not put milk in the fridge
Wouldn't it go off in a day
Ours would
You can do many things with cold boiled eggs
Not really
Especially with older people or people with kids it's common to ask "can you wrap the rest" to take it home
I mean, if you insist on taking home tiny crumbs, it might seem weird, but I don't think anybody really cares
I'm glad of that, tbh
there is enough food waste in the culinary world as it is
I think it is common
Also depends on the meal, a schnitzel or 1-2 pieces of pizza will most likely be taken home,
just wrapping it in aluminium foil works
For other dishes like soup, or stuff with sauces I do not think it is common
It is definitely possible but uncommon
I buy as much food as I want to eat at a restaurant
I don't want to spend crazy amounts of money for cold food at home
In some restaurants with a sizable portion left over I've even had aluminium foil delivered by the waiter with the check unasked
Uncommon in Austria
What
In the rual areas where the portions are almost always huge it is very common
Especially with older people
Hm, maybe my family was too frugal for that
I grew up on the countryside but we kids had to share plates and the grown-ups didn't order more than main course and maybe shared a salad
US International: It's basically QWERTY, but it allows to type ü, ö, ä with just using AltGR+y/p/q (just the button left of the original letter so it's easy to rembember) or ß with AltGr+s
QWERTZUIOPÜ
ASDFGHJKLÖÄ
YXCVBNM
(also known as German QWERTZ)
Glad you asked, I use a modified QWERTZ layout, the [T2 Layout] It's easy to install and doesn't change any of the usual keys, but gives you an additional layer of many more [special characters] (mostly accessed through AltGr/AltShift)
It stays totally out of the way if you don't need it, but makes it easy to write things like a capital ẞ, proper „quotation marks“ and »literary quotation marks«, proper en – and em dashes —, and ð and ſ and ⌀ and æ and ≠ and ‽ and ✓ and ålƚ tħë diăcrīṭiçs you could ask for
It has the stated goal of making all latin-alphabet based national languages fully typeable in one layout, hence it's also called Europatastatur (even though you can write languages like Vietnamese or Hawaiian with it as well)
If you're on a German QWERTZ layout, I can highly recommend it
Additionally, if you want to make little adjustments (like adding more specific characters like ʒƷ), you [can do so] with the (now outdated, but still usable) [MS Keyboard Layout Creator] As something that we use so much each and every day, I think it's totally worth it to personalize our keyboard layout to our preferences
I'm a programmer so definitely US qwerty but i also have german qwerty and slovak qwerty installed when i need them
qwertz is evil and should be purged from this world
like who looked at the keyboard and said let's switch these two characters but nothing else
fuck that person
As Austrian myself I used the German QWERTZ for the longest time, but changed it at home about 2 years ago to QWERTY US international layout, and shortly after that at work too
I am still not completly used to it, but it wasn't too big of a change
And since the US international keyboard layout is the most complete one, I can still use all the Umlaute and every other special chars
Used QUERTZ until I moved to the US
Moving back to Austria now but will continue using QERTY
Much better access to special characters
T2 represent
Well, the [Europatastatur] implementation at least
If you feel like adding more diacritics again, the [T2 layout/Europatastatur] is a viable option (and quickly installed)
I use [the E1-Layout from 2018] and it has almost every Latin-based and Greek letter plus a few other symbols
WTF
That's nuts
Accents don't even exist in German, but I can write È easier than that
And our äöü keys are definitely not double occupied
When I press shift and ÄÖÜ the expected thing happens, capital letters
>But the accent key software implementation is a mac thing as far as I know
Works on Windows just fine: é È É è
Is this really not a thing with Italian keyboards
Dude, Le Pont du Gard is absolutely breathtaking
Nothing i saw in France came close for me except maybe Dijon-Prenois, if for completely different reasons :))
I heard Sardinian is the closest language to spoken Latin
Chains are only for emergency, short usages
so much this
it depends on the party, and the amount of people and food that's left over
and hoarding your alcohol would be seen as very weird here as well
because they will also have a line
Yeah, but hardly if you invite people for dinner
If I invite somebody I of course am going to cook for them
And I also disagree about dinner always being cold
If you are working full-time this would often mean no warm meals during the week
> think you're underestimating our winters
You are underestimating their winters
You can‘t compare Austria, were every road in the valley or flatlands will be free of snow in a matter of hours to Finland, were even the highways will be packed with snow for months
> i don't see the difference in performance to studded tyres and winter tyres with chains
The difference is huge
Chains are made for a short emergency
They suck balls, but are good enough to get you up a icy/snowy road
In Austria we are currently abolishing the tax reduction for light transports and its a drama
But good riddance
Wait, I thought you were against opening on sundays, but its really only being against it if its inconvenient for you
You want that doctors have open on sundays so that its more convenient for you, why should they sacrifice their sunday if you don't want to, same with all the other services that are open on Sunday

I don't know about Italy, but in Austria he is/was **hugely** popular
Our only civil war and enacting the first fascist regime in Austria seems like a big thing
I don't know what you are talking about
O right poland, that nation that exists again
@germany and @russia can we partition that one again
And btw, germany you can have our share in exchange for bavaria
Deal
Well, his version of Germany died with him sooo
It's finally time for you to split up
Or find spme other solution but i am pretty shure that currently your nation just can't work
civil war lasted only for 3 days so it was really just the last resistance
No, we have enough conservative mountain weirdos already
How about Berlin
I think slovenia wouldn't be happy if we would try to get a coastline, and italy doesn't even give south tyrol back so i don't think that they would give us the righful austrian kingdom of venice-lombardy
And i mean hungary also holds righful austrian land most noteable the entire state of hungary
Really
Just wieden
Could't you have burned down all of vienna except wieden, in wieden is my university so i need that place, the rest of vienna i don't care about
(Yes i know that you call vienna wieden but wieden is just one district)
"Some kind of wild eastern mountain german" funny, laughed
Austria in German terms: Berlin with only Bavaria around it
Also the merger would result in us getting the CSU
Can you imagine the evil that the CSU-OVP alliance could accomplish
The real question is wether you like my art or not
Are you talking about accents or dialects
I know in English they're often used interchangeably but they're different things
In my own interest I'll say no ;)
It's not like people will give you a weird look or anything but I definitely feel a little bit lost whenever I'm in a restaurant alone, just because I don't really have anyone to talk to
Eat alone with confidence
Show dominance by ordering two main meals AND dessert
I thought this only existed in series, movies and books
I don't know if it's obscure or anything, but I think Hascheeknödel and Grammelknödel should be known more widely
Hascheeknödel are dumplings filled with ground sausage, Grammeln (so dumplings filled with is) are some sort of roasted pork belly fat (I cant't exactly describe it) that is a little bit crunchy and very tasty
I think it is something very underrated in our cousine
[Spinach dumplings]
[Schlipfkrapfen] They're not even that well known in the rest of Austria, but they are so delicious
Dumplings filled with mashed potatoes, spices, garlic and chive, cooked and then served with grated cheese and melted butter
They're so underrated
Hirn mit Ei
It's basically just scrambled eggs with pig's brain
I know a lot of people who love it but let's be honest that's just gross
Hascheeknödel are obscure in many parts of Austria
Try getting Haschee in Vienna
> Canederli
One of my favourite words - Italianized "Knödel".
I never understood why you call it federweißer, as we call it Sturm (just storm)
And it works for red and white wine
I make it myself
Fleischknödeln aren't half as good as Hascheeknödeln
Just make sure that the filling is not too low on fat, because this will make it pretty dry, so add some spicy and more fatty sausage too
I think the word is actually from the russian, but i may be mistaken
It's very a similar dish, only that Spinatknödel usually are bigger
Which probably makes them less efficient for priest-strangling since you can't gobble them down as a whole
Do give them a try, they may look humble but they're really tasty
Some people find bread dumplings (Semmelknödel) a bit hard to make because they tend to fall apart if you don't prepare them the right way
The two most important steps in the recipe are to let the bread dough soak for half an hour, and to not boil the heck out of the dumplings but just simmer them
(That recipe also doesn't mention seasonings
Salt, pepper and nutmeg are the most common ones)
>I don't understand how kebabs and baklava somehow became the face of Turkish cuisine
It's the face turkish imigrants cuisine in Western Europe
My uncle is a retired chef in Rome
I'm blessed :D
Yeah that sounds reasonable
We basically have white, red and schilcher sturm
[Schilcher] is a red or rose wine from Styria and sourish
It is different to what some regions in Germany call schilcher
There is a quote from pope Pius 6
„Sie haben Uns einen rosaroten Essig vorgesetzt, den sie Schilcher nannten
– Papst Pius VI
, 1782[6]
They served us a pink vinegar, which they called Schilcher
We have a few:
> As of 2019, Austria has 10 sites inscribed on the list and a further 12 on the tentative list
Three World Heritage Sites are shared with other countries: Fertö / Neusiedlersee Cultural Landscape is shared with Hungary; Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps with France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland; and Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe with Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Ukraine
In 2017, the site Historic Centre of Vienna was inscribed on the list of World Heritage in Danger due to planned new high-rise buildings
All but one of the World Heritage Sites in Austria are of the cultural type
Ten at the moment

> I’d say the most famous is the Aachener Dom
Really
I'd say it's by far the Kölner Dom
I‘m not a believer, but love to have a peek into all kinds of churches, temples and stuff
And Modena‘s Cathedral is my all time favourite
It‘s not huge or fancy, but it has its very distinct charisma
Old and cosy, yet so much inside
Love it
Because there is only one correct answer
Team cebolla
In Austria pancakes are called Palatschinken and the donut without a hole is a Krapfen
Other food-related words that come to mind are tomatoes (Paradeiser instead of Tomaten) and potatoes (Erdäpfel or Grundbirnen instead of Kartoffeln)
Some people also call strawberries Ananas instead of Erdbeeren, but that's mostly old people and I think it stems from the latin name fragaria x ananassa
Edit: And if you chop up Palatschinken to make soup with them they are called Frittaten all of a sudden, and the soup is called Frittaten-Suppe
> Some people would use the word Pfannkuchen for a Berliner
Which is a Krapfen
Why not just pronounce it the way you say cone
Or is that a contentious topic as well
That's why I'm atheist
It has nothing to do with ham dude
Plactenta (Latin for cake) -> palacsinta -> Palatschinke
With Palatschinken at least I thought it's the other way round - sounds more slavic than german to me
Does u/porcupineporridge agree on this
If they do, why make saying scone harder than it needs to be, since there's just an s more at the start
It sure is
Krapfen is quite German as far as I know, but Palatschinken came into German from the latin Placenta via Hungarian, Czech and Romanian
Oh, I've heard German tourists order "Einen Palat-Schinken bitte" in my favourite restaurant
Cracked me up
Easy
I’d go with the word by word translation and call it Eastempire
Fucking fierce and no more confusion with kangarooland
Austrialia
Just to sow more confusion
Austria = Eastrealm
Eastrick or Austrick
Hear me out
Just taking German Österreich is a bit hard and has an Umlaut
The Old High German name of the original core land was Ostarrichi ("Eastern Realm"), that's a bit anachronistic, but a starting point to reconstruct the name into modern English
Austria is the Latinized name for Austria, usually used in Romance languages
English adopted this name for our land, I guess, with the Norman conquest
The Old English name was *Ēastrīce* (East Realm)
Now lets see how the name has developed in other Germanic languages: Swedish Österrike, Danish Østrig, Frisian Eastenryk, Faroe Eysturríki, Norwegian Austerrike, Dutch Oostenrijk, Scots Austrick, Icelandic Austurríki
(I'd add the Germanic language closest to German, namely Yiddish, [but I don't know how to read Hebrew letters]
The "east" syllable seems to be is more or less consistent, and it also appears like this in old English
However the "austr" part also seems to be common northwest Germanic influenced languages
The "rick" part I am taking from the closest languages to English: Frisian and especially Scots
Also, compared the Anglisations of German(ic) names like Fried**rich** to Frede**rick**
Austrian Empire, this might sound like i am a fascist/monarchist but "Österreich" has empire in its name and it makes translations weird (even thought this is kind of true, dont take it serious, i would not want the name changed)
There's a common name in Austria that comes from Hungary called Horvath
I wonder if it comes originally from croatia
The more accurate literal translation would be Eastern Realm
The first mention of Ostarrichi was 996, back then it was part of the duchy of Bavaria, so it was neither a kingdom nor an empire at that time; it was a realm (= Reich), that was positioned in the very Eastern part of the Holy Roman Empire
edit: grammar
Eastempire
I could really work with that
maybe the original east german empire or east Germany
Comment so i don't forget to check for the ragecomment of a moravian that will come in a few hours
Thank you Lowlander
Uhm
Don’t know what you learned in history but this might trigger something
Thank you Vespuccian
yeah that's a *great* idea, make the new name fucking long like the last one so nobody will care to use it, *again*!
Or Netherlish (English)
Again I'm surprised how terrible my written Spanish is compared to my spoken one
I thought it was called "Ne*d*erlandés".
In German it's Krawatte, while Croat is Kroate, but in Austrian dialect we say Krawod, which sounds again like Krawatte
yeah but because L2-speakers always try to overcompensate and don't care to take the same shortcuts that a native would
took me a few years of struggling with "cloth-s" before I realized natives just say fuck orthography, and call it "cloze" instead
not really hard then: clozehorse
Norge sounds like it has an emphasis on the e :/
people ITT: apparently not knowing the option of choosing a weird/fun/interesting name as the second or third name
Actually sounds pretty coo tbh
I also really like that name
I try to avoid them since I'm not a fucking billboard and don't see why I should even pay more to be one
But in general you'll see loads, your ex roommate must've lived in a special bubble if that's how he perceived it
Personally, I don't like them, but I highly doubt that this is true for a majority of Europeans
At least where I live most people don't give a fuck

2 things i take away from here:
1) it's good to have a reality check for your romantic views on other countries
2) expectations towards Austria seem to be really low, if no-one here is disappointed in us :D fits us perfectly
Na they aren't that low, it's just that Austria as a country will never be as idolized as Italy or France for instance, so people won't ever be that disappointed
Get over here and we'll throw a shrimp on the barbie
Pretty spot on :) read the last bit as 'retarded-ish' first
i guess 'retired-ish' is still correct
This "socialist utopia" you are talking about is such an american concept
Almost no-one in europe views socialism as something to aspire to
On the other hand most of us are social-democratic, which is a very different thing but always gets mixed up by americans
I blame your education system
Yes, at least a washing machine
in most apartment buildings people have their own washing machine, not all though
Personally i never lived anwyhere, or seen an apartment, withouth a washing machine
Seems terribly inconvenient, not to have that
I've seen Bernie Sanders being called a socialist so many times by americans even though he just wants a similar system as we have here, so don't tell me nobody thinks of europe as a socialist utopia
A lot of your conservatives call europe an utopia for socialists
I'm 26
Who wants a socialist/communist government is the important question
Of course I'd like a socialist society
That would be very nice
But have you ever looked at any attempt to build a country based on either
All of them have failed due to the greed of a few, which mostly were the leading class/government
I was a convinced socialist 10 years ago, but then I have studied the realities of those governments and where they have failed
And in my opinion a socialist country is just not sustainable anymore
I'm still very much a leftie, I have just abandoned my idealistic hopes and dreams for a more realistic idea of a country with a very strong social net and regulated capitalism
Free market and free capitalism like in the US is not the way to go, since this allows for monopolies that can control the market
I dont See a problem with it either
Have a similar arrangement since my flat is too small for a machine with a washer and dryer in the basement
But it's definitely not the norm
There's some buildings who have a basement like that but most apartments have their own setup nonetheless
just curious: where in italy is the surname Costa from
or where does it appear the most
No, if it is about English alone
Yes if it is about German-speaking people who think it's cool to mix 20% English and 80% German into their sentences
Or ads that are like that
No more than about threads asking if we are annoyed by it
I don't know, i really enjoy the English language for several reasons, one being its simplicity
I find myself even speaking it to myself (aloud or in my head), although i have no idea how or why that all started
Maybe out of laziness to use the German language, which can be cumbersome at times
And it often sounds kinda harsh
So, no, i'm not annoyed at all
I'm happy that's it's the universal language because it's really easy
I don't mind
What does bother me though is people saying English is such an easy language
Sure the grammar is easy, but when it comes to pronunciation it's like you decided "fuck it, we don't need rules". Entitled native speakers really are infuriating
Learning another language is always hard
Or you know, making fun of accents
Our brains are shaped by our first language
If the other language has sounds that are not part of you first language you will probably never learn to speak them correctly
Also a lot of people in this thread complain about English loan words
Of course we use a lot of English words
Just look at how many French words we still use (Niveau, Adresse, Büro, etc) because it once was the lingua franca
And yes some words will be used incorrectly or change their meaning
Just live with it
So many of our German words have different roots, we don't even realise
And it is the same in other language
English has some German words too (Kindergarten, Gesundheit, Rucksack, Poltergeist, Blitzkrieg,...)
Wir müssen die deutsche sprache streamlinen um value zu adden
You know that you use German words too
I doubt that any language in the world uses their own language exclusively
There are always influences from other languages
Spitze of the morgens to ya
I find this very interesting, the spelling of some of those words is extremely similar to the actual pronounciation in Styrian dialects of Austria
Hans Solo sounds like an the name of an Austrian Schlager musician
It's funny how her Adidas is spot on correct and her pronunciation of Nike is just wrong in the same way as the Germans do it wrong
It's like she learned how to pronounce it from somebody from Germany
Given that the company is actually named after Nike then a German, who were to read the company name as any other German word would actually be closer to the [actual pronunciation] of the ancient Greek goddess than any American or British
But as mentioned in the video the founder of Nike can choose to pronounce it however the fuck he wants

I guess you mean the death of Ögedei Khan in 1241
They were also very close to Vienna already, when the Khan died
How the death of one person can change the entire course of history is amazing sometimes
This doesn't exist in Austria, as far as I know (if you don't count Tirol and especially Vorarlberg, where Italian is common due to their geography
I can speak some Yiddish but not school level
I speak a very distinct, small german dialect from the south of Salzburg, yes
So just a regular german dialect like most of us Austrians or is it something special
I got that
But some Austrian dialects (like in Lungau) are a bit special and spoken by very few people
The normal dialects are spoken by nearly everyone and are not a minority language
Germany is the country that is the culturally and politically closest to us
Our nominal neutrality doesn't mean anything
We are a small, ineffectual country that relies on our European neighbors and NATO to defend us
The british are way worse at admiting this
Doesn't matter, Austria (same as Switzerland+Liechtenstein) is surrounded by NATO members and safely tucked into the whole NATO-EU military framework
Completely delusional to think a country in our situation can be truly neutral
I think it was a mixed bag for Czechoslovakia
You ended up with 50 years of communism, but at least we gave you a convenient justification to finally get rid of your unruly German-speaking population

I want the templer ottoman vs the assassine viennese in the second siege of vienna
Templer help the ottoman cause the emperor hiddes some artifact or something
Well, I suppose you could make an assassins creed that leads to a world war
Around 1800, during the era of fin-de-siecle or shortly before, at the height of the Danube Monarchy, when Vienna was a cosmopolitan hotspot
You'd sneak through lavish balls and assassinate rich aristocrats and industry magnates, sabotage the construction of some nobleman's palais along the Ring avenue, blend into the crowd while eavesdropping on some artists or scientists debating in one of the coffee houses, visit doctor Freud's office and go riding through the green and hilly countryside around the city
Damn, now I want this
Uhm
hard question for Austrians since basically everything leads to a world war
My first thought was an assassins creed before WW1 that ends in sarajevo with killing Franz Ferdinand, because honestly there are way to many games about Hitler and WW2 already
My second thought would be a wholesome one where you just go from Heurigen to Heurigen and drink some wine with your buddies
I guess thats what i prefer
1913: Alternate timeline in which some guy in a hoodie kills hitler, stalin, tito, trotsky and freud
I thought the same, it's such an iconic era and would be quite different from what they already did
You could also travel to different locations in the empire, Prague, Budapest, Bad Ischl, Grado
I mean, it's a great era, but it's also *the* wellknown Viennese era
Something a bit more unknown would be great
Someone suggested Nazi era Praha above - I think with AC's map sizes one could easily make a Resistance game that covers Czech and Austrian territories
And could showcase the complicated alliances and networks of people
Ah yes
An AC Viennese Version would be lovely

We usually watch any of the die hard movies
Yes, I watch it every year with my dad

* Hinterwäldler (people living behind the woods)

* PS2: Schluchtenscheißer (canyon shitters) for mountain folk
Proleten
Fpö Wähler
I heard Schluchtenscheißer only from Germans for Austrians in General
And im kinda disappointed if Viennese People use it, its not very creative
And Mostschädel, well originally its a derogatory term used by the people of Innviertel (which came to Austria with a bavarian density of breweries while the rest of Austria drank "Most") for the rest of Austria or especially the despised rest of Upper Austria
Sandler
What about Sandler
Krocher mit Kapuzenwesten
what
these are surprisingly wrong
a redneck is not the same as a "country bumpkin", in your examples the defining connotation of lower social class is completely missing
one of the examples we don't even use ourselves, it's a derogatory demonym used for Austrians by Germans
keeping in mind the examples that OP gave, there's only one correct answer really: the Austrian version of chav/gopnik/redneck/Asi would be a **Prolo**, short from **Prolet**, a [member of the proletariat] [other example]
Sauproleten
Proleten are mainly low class city ppl though, not country ppl like rednecks
Nope, only for those living in the mountains (i.e. south-west)
Tyrolians, Salzburgers, Carinthians, Styrians
Those four
> Viennese People use it, its not very creative
Never heard it used in Vienna, it's not a Viennese word, we have a whole dictionary of more original Viennese Beleidigungen, so not sure why it made OP's list
Sure, someone somewhere uses it in Austria, but it's probably not within the top 10 mild insults a Wiener will use
it's decidedly foreign, no worries
never heard it being used here
country bumpkins are still called Landeier last time I checked
A Sandler is a homeless person, not the same as a redneck
The English equiv would be hobo, in that case (not redneck)
guess I don't have to ask where you live
Gopniks aren't just rual either, quite the opposite in fact
fair enough
Viennese definitely aren't.

So there was this guy called Falco, he was(is) AWESOME like, one of a kind, sadly he passed away after a horrible car crash in 1998 but his music lives on
Falco is the best
Oh yes
I recently learned some Norwegian and it was surprising how close it was to German (especially Austrian German)
Most interesting was probably bus driver: Buschauffeur in Austrian German and bussjåfør in bokmål.
Overall, I get the sense of longer written texts from the context - but if it's just a few words (like a street sign) and I don't understand of the words it's impossible
Dutch is similar, understand written but listening to it is quite hard
Dutch is german spoken by a drunk englishmen and written down by someone who had a stroke while doing so
You get what it's about but that's about it
But it's a matter of training
I don't decipher Swedish regularly so it's much harder than when you're confronted with it more often
I can tell you what the article is about but can't go into too much detail
But yes written Swedish is actually easier than Danish imho
perfect time to get "sich ausgehen" (eine Ressource, die für ein Vorhaben ausreicht, sowohl zeitlich als auch räumlich etc) under your belt
that's the one that's *always* tripping me up when speaking German-German, along with what to say for Lavoir/Schaffel (... Waschbehältnis
Ah, haven't heard beigehen before, the more you know
How would you use that, "Gehen wir bei Zerglinge zu produzieren
"? Sounds kinda complicated instead of "lass uns". :)
Oh, and [this] is a Lavoir
Interesting, the way you use it, it nearly sounds like the meaning could be defined as "vorbeigehen, vorbeischauen bei". Eventuell noch wie "zur Hand gehen"?
"Lanternisation":  was lynched and hung from a lantern post in 1848
Last death sentence by us was carried out by strangulation
Last death sentence on our soil was by hanging
Defenestration didn't kill anyone
Squad
I thought it was one bullet to the back of the neck
good ol' impaling
Never forget Elisabeth
Reasons for dating romanian women: They're beautiful
Reasons not to date Romanian women : They might impale you ass first if you wrong them
Thanks, now I'm terrified and attracted
Fairly common in Transylvania/Western part of Romania
You would usually find schools where they teach the romanian curricula almost fully in German or in Hungarian
In big cities (also in the eastern part) you will also find schools that teach in “international” languages like English, French or Spanish, but locally you’d also find other minority language schools for Serbians, Bulgarians, Ukrainians or even Slovaks
You don’t have to belong to a minority group to be able to study in such a school, so that a lot of Romanians attend them in order to make sure they learn another language in depth
Especially the students of schools that teach widespread languages are perceived as having better chances of attaining a higher paid job, as the foreign language ones are usually one of the better (high)schools in town
Simultaneously, they are also the most likely ones to emigrate
At school level it's quite rare
On University level it's quite common to teach in English
English isn‘t an option here, it’s one if the main subjects every single school no matter what and every class has
From year 1 to year 13
My class teacher back then was an english and history teacher so she quite often taught history in english
But I think other than this it‘s not common at all
Prob because no subject will merge into another or will do stuff another subject should teach
(Eg musical history is only for Music
Not for History
Edit: I‘m going to an engineering school so I barely have any other languages other than english
Maybe people who are going to/went to schools with more languages can agree/disagree with this
Edit 2: Universities that teach in english are extremely common tho
I went to an exclusive german speaking school in Oradea
As an Austrian I was obviously very lucky as a kid that I was able to talk my own native tongue at school :)
Some should have as well
Don't know about the Burgenland Croats, [but there's a least one Gym for Carinthian Slovenes]
AFAIK in German-majority Südtirol regular subjects are all in German and Italian is taught as a separate subject from the beginning and in Italian-majority Trentino it's vice versa
I guess there's also schools where it is 50:50
And ofc both regions have schools were it is vice versa for the respective minorities
Don't know how it works in the Ladino areas though
They are kind of a language minority surrounded by Italian and German speakers who might or might not be a minority themselves
On the contrary
We want to get rid of some provinces, but can't.
We have the FPÖ right wing party, which is struggling to separate itself from common sense
I'd say they're more than half way there
Austrian here, we want to get fucking rid of Vienna but they just won’t leave
;-)
Yeah, but cutting out Vienna will be really hard you know
More of like A Vatican situation in Rome then
Keep it for tourists and it‘s full of weird people in beautiful buildings
Well, I was semi kidding
But our westernmost federal state once wanted to join Switzerland, only Switzerland didn't want them
only as a joke
we really dont want to
no, Vorarlberg is one of the wealthier and most beautiful areas
Some people joke about giving back Burgenland to Hungary
But it has nice Wine and food, it is mostly banter between the states :D
That gives a whole new meaning to the [Pacific War]
My favourite example for this is *dragon* and *kite*. In German both words are *Drache*.
Oh my glob that's cool
I wish we had that in German
adding "Mist" to that; might only be in Austrian German though
Ha I got a better one for English speakers: poison & venom = gift ;)
>We usually just say "fuck it
"Soldier
Take the fuck it and do your job
they do collapse again in informal speech, at least down South:
Ich lerne X.
Ich lerne ihm Y.
"Ich lehre ihm" sounds crazy formal here
Here in Austria both are pronounced literally the same
> Though kinda as a side note; At least for Sweden, the English knowledge is often overstated to my experience
Not the quantity, but the quality
A lot of people have insufficient knowledge in day-to-day topics
That's the problem with most of these "English proficiency" ratings - they usually use the answers of people who already take a test and are willing to improve their skill
If there were an EU-mandated English proficiency survey, it would yield much worse results
Damn Germans with their stupid dubbing
They drag us down with them
I don't really identify with any of that, to be honest
Exploring nature
Riding my bicycle around the village
With my friends back then, we used to build 'houses' in the forest out of sticks
Some of them turned out to be quite functional
At home it was legos or playing pokemon on my gameboy color
Parents were not in favor of videogames back then so time on the latter was limited haha
Great times
Watching tv, playing lego/with barbies, running around in the forest, playing with other children in the village, going around by bike
A real redditor
From head to toe
Very similar
My parents didn't like video games, so we always played at my friend's place
Also, two of my friends had huuuge model train setup, which was cool
Can relate to the seasons being endless
Also, summer holidays seemed to contain a whole lifetime
> trading football stickers to make your sticker album full\
I still haven't recovered from those financial losses
I'm struggling with the "R" in just about every word, I just can't pronounce it properly
For example when I wann say "are" it sounds like "awe", or "Rock and Roll" sounds like "Wockn and Woll"
By now I think I‘ve learned to pronounce most of the english words (sometimes „three“ makes me stumble) but I remember avoiding using „thorough“ for  years because I couldn‘t pronounce it
Squirrel is definitely the one that took me the longest to sound somewhat like a native would sound
well, if you talk to native speakers you'll hear anything from very by the book water to woa-dah
In my dialect it’s „Oachkatzl“.
I had the same issue, until someone told me "Queue" is just "Q" with "ueue" waiting line
maybe that helps you too
Nice I like tom scott, i'll check it out, thanks mate
Der ist nur dabei wenn wir den Deutschen ein Wort geben, dass sie dann nachsprechen sollen
Ein sehr alter Witz, aber immer wieder lustig
As an Austrian, I feel connected to other "small neighbour countries", like Ireland or New Zealand
They share the language with their bigger neighbour, their culture might be related, but there are some profound differences that seem minor from the outside, but are a big part of the identity
I think it depends
Our rural area seems to be similar to Canada's just without the bears (and whatever else they have)
Of course it is a neighbor country but I have to mention Switzerland
Austria seems to be an in between of Germany and Switzerland
Of course everyone has individual opinions
City-like
I don't know
Like most of European cities I guess
And outside Europe
that's difficult
We don't have many high buildings/skyscrapers (tho some more are going to be built atm) that makes it a bit difficult I think
To the other Austrians: What do you think
Sofia seems eerily similar to Vienna in terms of how the city "feels" like
Prolly mostly due to Vienna exporting their architects there for a while
Costa Rica felt surprisingly close in some aspects to Austria
(Relatively) rich, small but not tiny country in the center of a continent, touristy, relatively strong focus on organic stuff and renewables
Of course there are also quite some differences, but looking at other central american countries in comparison, CR really stands out
Mentality and culture wise countries or regions that used to be part of the Empire are usually also closer than a lot of Austrians realize (often even closer than Germans), the language barrier is real though
I think it’s hard to say, of course the neighboring countries look similar landscape-wise, all the cities that were build during the habsburg monarchy kinda look the same, doesn’t matter if you are in Slovenia or Hungary or Austria, think the yellow churches for example
I think minus the catholic aspect the UK might be similar
Both used to be way bigger empires, kinda dark humor, one big tourist attractor city, smaller industry-heavy cities, lots of space for agriculture but at the same time basically no dangerous wild animals, cuisine is meat and potato-heavy, often when people think about the prime of the countries they think of past times, they share a language with a bigger country and it’s basically the same but certain words are different and people point it out a lot, ... but that’s just my two cents
Oh right
Thanks for the addition
I wouldn't call them "far away" though, with the exception of Mexico (which wasn't part of Austria for very long at all
For me it would be the [Grimming] The highest isolated peak in Europe
Quite an impressive view from the plain
At the border of the last foothills of the alps and the minor hungarian depression
On a good day you can scale one of the hills and see two European capitals, Vienna and Bratislava
Does it have to be in my own country
Across the border in Northern Italy there's the so-called [Erdpyramiden (earth pyramids)] which are quite awesome and unique-looking
One I could think of on the spot is maybe [Der Grüne See/Green Lake]
It‘s special because in summer the ice from the Hochschwab Mountains which surrounds it melts and fills the lake and it reaches it‘s maximum depth of 12m (39 ft)
In winter the water recedes and the lake is almost empty
There‘s a little bench in the middle of the lake where you can sit on in winter and scuba dive down to in summer
I don‘t know why that was the first thing I thought of
And for Austria I will always say Tiergarten Schönbrunn, the worlds oldest zoo
And the first zoo that had a naturally bred panda baby born in the very same zoo
Along with one out of 10 european zoos that‘s actually allowed to keep pandas and protect them
And as for nature only, the alps, for obvious reasons
Immediatly, I thought this must be great for bouldering/climbing
Wow, so far I have had exactly 1online lesson
It was a 3hour lesson about paper production
There‘s also a village I know that’s called St
Gandolf and every once in a while someone comes by to correct it to make it *Gandalf
Warte warte wirklich
"Po" means butt in German, so the Po river is the butt river to us
Also Austria, and sounds funny in Austria/German: Kotzendorf (vomit village), Grünz bei Schweinern (oink at pigen), Hühnergeschrei (hen's screams), Einöd (barren/deserted place), there's a few more I can't think of right now
we also have gaming and eisenwurzn wich basiclly translates to ironshit
Assling and Namlos (=nameless) are the only ones I can think of rn
Wankham in Austria
Our arch dukes chauffeur drove a different way, than he was supposed to
[Kaprun disaster (2000)]
A funicular train caught fire because of a design fault and 155 people died mainly because the doors could only be opened by the operator
Probably the [Kaprun disaster 2000] A funicular burned in a tunnel on a mountain
155 people died, 12 survived
The fire was triggered by a faulty fan heater
A lack of safety mechanisms on the train and shitty escape routes resulted in the high death toll
Weren't more people killed and injured in the train crash of Eschede
Yep
The day I was born
You even ignored the: "never trust an austrian"-rule a second time
Yeah me too
How would history have changed if Ferdls chauffeur wouldn't have gotten lost
How would the modern world be
Hell how even would the fronts have been in the great war - would there have even been a ww2 the way it was
Not particularly
At a funeral I would follow all the religious rituals and whatnot out of respect for the dead but generally no
No not really, I think it‘s the usual „I‘m sorry“ or something like that
When my grandma died my brother didn‘t go to church either because he‘s very non-religious and during her lifetime none of my family had a good relationship to her (she hated all of us most of her lifetime, and when she got into an elder care home (idk what to call it) she did get a little bit better but I believe she still hated my mom and my brother didn‘t meet her either during that time), so it‘d feel insincere to play sad when somebody you had no relation to during their living times died
I wouldn‘t‘vd gone either, if I‘m being honest, if it wasn‘t for my mom and my dad forcing me to because they think it‘d be bad for our image if none of their children went
And also I‘d be a disrespectful bitch [it sounds nicer in our language] if I didn‘t go
Did you mean Australia
"I have been to Germany once
Have you ever been to Berlin
Yes, yes I have
It's not my capital city, but yes
Something about Kangaroos or our Nice opera house mostly
Well you got like 90% of the most dangerous animals so let's call it even
Eh we're good
Can confirm btw, the brown ones are the biggest cunts in our country too, if for slightly different reasons
It's white outside
But I'm fairly far up a mountain and on the "shadow" side
When I look out of the window and see the other side of the valley, where the sun shines a lot more, they don't have any snow
Went sledding just yesterday
No, and it is absolutely frustrating
I love snow and I have a little child - that its not snowing breaks my heart
Live at the beginning of the Alps, but in a valley
It has snowed three times that were measurable
We still have a little bit of snow on the ground where there is shade most of the day
Pretty terrible winter considering at this time last year we had over a meter and a half of snow on the ground
It has snowed twice here in Vienna but the snow was gone within 24 hours both times if I recall
In my hometown at 600 metres there is no snow
You have to travel around the 1000 metre mark to get artificial snow and 1500 to meet real snow on slopes
other than slopes there's little to speak of
Same here in southern Sweden :(
We live on the outskirts of the alps but we do get our fair share of snow, normally
There hasn't been a closed snowcover at all this year
It's.. weird
Where do you live
I got a closed snowcover in my hometown
Second biggest city
Nice
I live in the biggest Bezirk on 1100 Höhenmeter, but we don't even have much snow here
It's enough to go skiing at least :)
Judging by the incredible amount of teleshopping asvertisement on German TV I would think that this business is doing really okay
Foreign minister Figl [presenting the freshly signed state treaty] from the balcony of the Belvedere palace in 1955
It re-established Austria as a sovereign nation and concluded 10 years of allied occupation
I dont know what to think about Figl
On the one Hand he was a proponent of Dollfuß and the "Ständestaat" but then again he suffered quite a lot at Dachau
Was whipped to a Pulp and was judged to dark and solitary confinment for 6 months for using the word "Austria".
But then he again he drank molotov under the table,
I thought of exactly the same picture
IMHO the proclamation of the first Republic [had a more iconic pic]
While I do appreciate his resistance against Nazi Germany and later redemption as a now democratic figure and supporter of a multi party state I think that his support of Austrofascism, antiparliamentarism and his leadership role in the Austrian variant of the SA were way too easily forgotten
Generally the conservatives in Austria didnt get enough shit postwar for basically serving the nation on a platter for the Germans with them normalizing authoritarianism, political violence and dictatorship in 1934
But then again we didnt even really cleanse actual still ideological Nazis acting as judges, professors and prosecutors postwar
And he pulls a bottle of gasoline, lights the contract on fire and proclaims himself Emperor

You must be a masochist
Italian is pure music for me, there's always such rhythm and flow to it
I barely understand a thing but i'll listen for hours
French
No other language makes you feel desired no matter whats said
The current Austrian president Alexander van der Bellen was born 1944 in vienna, but he was Estonian citizen until 1958
So not born in a foreign country, but also not Austrian since birth
My physics teacher really hated me and wanted me to fail really bad - she already managed that I got the worst grade so I had to make a special exam in autumn to be able to stay in my class
Then she asked me there a lot of stuff we never talked about
Luckily there were two other teachers present to which I complained about this showing them the notes of the three best students in class I borrowed
They went through it and told the teacher that this exam is invalid and she had to ask me different questions which they checked in the notes
12AM is noon and 12PM is midnight
This was my high school English teacher, who, upon me correcting her, told me I needed to get my ego in check and just “think about it” then I’d see why she was right
I brought in proof
Didn’t believe me still
She probably still teaches it like that too
I hated her
She was an AWFUL teacher
We were talking about multiethnic states
And she wouldn't accept the US but was totally fine with Spain
I know there are different ethnicities in Spain but still, nothing compared to the US
My brothers history teacher this year:
The Nazis were actually more like the social democrats just look at their party program
They have little in common with the FPÖ (the far right Austrian with all our Neonazis in it)
The "coloureds" were better off because they were colonized because they only got culture through the Europeans
Greta Thurnberg and the climate activists are "climate stalinists"
My physics teacher insisted that work is a vector
I had a biology teacher explain to my class what transsexuality is, but the thing she was actually explaining was intersexuality
I mean it's nice if she's trying to teach us about it but seriously, if you're trying to do that then do it right and don't teach your students who believe everything you say BS
Sadly I didn't find the courage to correct her, now I wish I had spoken up
Edit: spelling
A physics teacher in HTL (school for the Last 5 years of school with more emphasis in tech)
And i do not know, how she passed at uni, but all this is the same person
1) told us, at age 17, and after having two years of chemics at this school already (and mostly At previous school also) a great an new science developement: there are Atoms, and everything contains it
(And was surprised, we where not as as giddy and astonished about it, as she was)
2) the ancient agypts are at fault,  because there are no woods on the pyramids,  because they cut all the trees, that were growing on them (on a human made building
... but she really believed it)
Such ideas centered around the English language are funny
Like when people say that "Slav" and "slave" are related
> we actually wrote the author asking about this and printed his answer letter, refuting all intentional analogies, next to a scan of one of those "Your opinion is wrong" markings
This is savage af
I love it
Ah, yes
Austria, where teachers can literally fail you because they don’t like you
Politics teacher in high school tried that with me too
Our system is fucked
I guess deaf people can't think either
It's still so weird
When you start counting with 1 PM, then 2 PM ... the logical thing would be that 12 PM comes last, not first
To be completely honest, 12AM vs 12PM is retarded
I don't know which is which and I refuse to look it up, but I do remember it was totally counter-intuitive to me
Go find some other way to talk about those times of the day ... 24h clock face, "noon", "midnight", whatever ...
Well, in early days, billiard balls were in fact made of ivory
But it turned out to be not durable enough (and too expensive), so they invented a special kind of resin at some time in the 19th century
You saw it coming ...
She was/is still incorrect
Like, yeah it may be more complex than that, but I was still right lol
She explained it by saying since pm is for late things and am is for early things
Like that's just a bullshit explanation
She was easily the most stupid teacher I ever had, and that says a lot, because I had maybe 3 actually capable teachers in my entire Austrian middle and high school career
That was just the tip of her stupid iceberg
One time she took off points for a correct answer on a test and when I brought in proof that I was correct she just shrugged
But if you look at the 24hr system we use, we start counting at midnight (00:00) too, so then it makes sense again . But it definitely is weird
Oh yeah I get you
I personally would like to strangle any nationalist history teacher in Austria
Most of them are borderline Neonazis or reproduce Nazi rhetoric
many unironic
It's better these days
Back in the day the teachers had to create their own end exams, which you need to go to uni
You can imagine why this might be a bad idea I think
Variation of difficulty was insane
No it isn‘t? Up until the Matura, teachers have ALL the power because the system lets them make up grades based on their own individual made up rules
It’s AWFUL
That’s not what she meant though
She meant early as in light out
She was stupid
I don't know how so many people are so bad at geography
Almost everyone knows austria as a german-speaking country
Almost everyone knows that we got anschlussed by germany during ww2
And almost everyone knows where germany is
But my class was once in england and we got the job to ask a few people a few questions one being where is austria
(We gave them a blank map from europe for this)
The lists of nations we got as answers: norway, nederlands, belgium, luxenbourg, poland, hungary (was the most common answer), switzerland, bosnia, slovenia, belarus, ukraine,(estonia,latvia,lithuania,kaliningrad (this 4 were one guy who was 100% shure that we are trolling him that it isn't one of them, espessially when we said "no thats russia" when he pointed at kaliningrad)) and tunis (north africa was also shown on the map)
Out of 50 people (10 teams everyone had to ask 5 people or groups of people) 3 got austria right (and one of them who got it right was a spanish woman, the other people we asked were english) (technicly 4 got it right but the 4th one got helped by some guy that was asked the question before by another group)
I don‘t know if it can represent my country but I can remember one that happened in 2020:
* Some guy with a Machete and in Lederhosen went to the Hofburg (where our presidents office is) and said he wanted to talk to our president
I think somewhere there was a bomb threat around spring or summer
They were starlings which are a huge pest
Pigeons are annoying and dirty
Starlings destroy tons of food every year
Oof shit really happened in 2020 for us
10°C is "ok, time to put on a shirt" weather in the nordic countries I assume

Hitler salute at our concentration camp memorial sites
Its stupid, disparages the victims and is just plainly disgusting
Them getting huge fines is satisfying though
Edit: many culprits are not outright neonazis but stupid (mostly male) students visting the sites as part of a school trip
Many others are though but mostly homegrown ones
Don't go into the mountains unprepared
And check the weather before you do
We have deaths every year from people going into the Alps like it's a giant theme park
Don't call us German, you won't make any friends
Refering to us as german is the best way of getting yourself killed
Generally never compare us with germany except if you are comparing us with something bavarian
If you are in an area that isn't a typical tourist region you shouldn't even be german if you don't want that everyone makes fun of you
Stand on the left side of an escalator
It's virtually suicide
A Tourist should never hitler around or order schnitzel with saucer

I chuckled
Here, you can't go into a public sauna with a bathing suit on

The food is more popular than the rest, yes; some people even regularly go to Ikea just to eat
&#x200B;
I have no idea if they have a slogan here, but I'm pretty ad-blind in general (luckily)
Barely ever been to one, it‘s kind of on the same rank (or maybe even outranked
) by the  other furniture companies like Möbelix, Mömax, XXLutz, etc
But generally, if one of your furniture breaks „Ikea furniture“ is often used to describe it, afaik
> Calling stuff gay
Yeah, that's so retarded
Yeah I really enjoyed it, but it's by no means a masterpiece
it's just an in your face, dumbed down version of films like Taxi Driver for the 21st century audience
It's hollow compared to the films that influenced it
The films message is clearly stated, and at some points I felt the film was saying: "this is what it's about, do you get it you dumb fuck
That being said it's well made and as always Joaquin Phoenix's acting is stellar
I can understand why, I haven't rewatched it since I saw it in the cinema and I went in expecting the usual DC shit
I guess that helps
Have you seen 'the Lighthouse'? It's a 'the Shining'-esque but not in the way 'Joker' is 'Taxi driver'-esque, imo it's the best film of 2019 (of the ones I've seen)
I think it was the scenes with the psychiatrist that felt particularly on the nose
I can't remember exactly what she said, but something along the lines of "they don't care about people like you, and they don't care about people like me" after finding out that he will have to pay for his own therapy/medication
In real life a psychiatrist is there so you can speak freely and be helped through your struggles, but using that in a film to have the main character be able to spell out exactly how they feel, and why they feel that way seemed a bit cheap
Show don't tell, especially as they had shown all that stuff anyway I don't think there was a need to tell it as well
I hope that makes sense haha
My country doesn't have them because we are (ostensibly) neutral
But the fact is that at least militarily, Europe is basically a US vassal
It's our current political world and we gotta live with it
Could be much worse
We don't have any in our own country, but honestly, I prefer to be influenced by the Americans compared to the other alternative
China
We're a small country, so some outside influence is inevitable, so I'm going to throw my weight behind a country that's actually democratic, not some Authoritarian state
[What is our life worth
so glad we have none of that shite
Pfuh, dort wirst ja ordentlich zerlegt ;)
I wish we were more independent from the US
I think they need someone who is equally strong as a counterweight
The US is not reliable enough, especially not with Trump
And they are way too powerful and regularly abuse that power
I definitely don't want them here in Austria
The US doesn't have 'reeducation camps' though
Also the political culture and freedom of the press are basically nonexistent in China
It's just a worse country to be influenced by in every possible way
As an Austrian, I tend to say: "Mehlspeisen". So baked sweets like cakes and stuff
We have a HUGE variety of different sorts with the Sachertorte being the most famous one
If I’m honest I refuse to eat Schnitzel outside of Austria
Maybe it‘s just me, maybe it‘s just the feeling of home, maybe it‘s really better in Austria
Austrian cheese is the best :3
In Vienna, we get our tap water directly from springs in the alps
It's better than many bottled brands
Danish ice cream is second to none
One Word
Mohnnudeln
(sachertorte is overrated)
In German, we sometimes use the word "Aufschnitt" for various sliced meats (sausage, ham, etc)
Its just a trick some waiters pull on annoying tourists
I have never paid for tap water
I guess it has something to do with general tastes
It's also the milder French cheeses that are sold around here
The demand for strong special cheeses is there but not mainstream
The problem has to be your houses pipes
There is no way there is undrinkable water in the water reservoir
The EU law is incredibly strict on that
Go right up to the border, that's what i did anyway, i think it was on one of islands in the Wattenmeer
Quargel (similar to your Handkäse) and Glundner Käse ist pretty exotic and strong
As Kid my favourite cheese was "Steirer Glundner" and you basically can't get it outside Styria and Carinthia (where it's called Kärntner Käse)
People often just prefer what they are used to
I dont think that this is arrogance, but only natural that peoples taste gets shaped by their surroundings
I just dont like most Belgian beers, even through my Belgian friends swear by them
Same for other dark beers
I also dont like strawberry flavoured Ales
I also think that it is unfair to compare big brands to small, local ones
How many beers from small breweries in Austria have you tasted
Probably none, and thats only natural
Bin Kärntner und mag fast alles, liebe fast jeden Käse, aber Glundner
puh
Keiner stinkt schöner
I have a Polish grocery store around the corner

It is not a single country and rather a subregion of Europe, but I am very interested in Scandinavian history
It was never mentioned in school
Most countries that were part of the Roman empire some time during its existence
Especially Italy, since it was the very heart of it
Honestly
Our own
Ever since i read "The history of the world in 100 objects" i can't answer this for one country anymore
My fascination of the interconnectedness of all of our history is so much greater than that for single, constructed frames of place or time
To me that's the real beauty of history and i wish that schools would rather focus on how all regions and aspects (technology, politics, health and desease, climate, art, etc) all work together and over time brought us to where we all are now
Nope, never heard of it
I remember the 30 Years' War, the Defenestrations of Prague etc, but I don't remember Swedens role in it all
This may be purely a mistake on my part or my bad memory, but I feel like we only talked about the First and Second World Wars (and the events leading up to both) in school for 2
5 years
I think there is a big focus on them in the curriculum due to Austrias role in both
It's been 13 years since I graduated from school
So maybe the curriculum has changed since then, but during my school days the Scandinavian countries were only mentioned in passing
The Vikings were also only mentioned when it came to the expansion of the Roman Empire in Europe
I guess a lot of my history lessons in school revolved around Austrian history, because
there is a lot to unpack, let's put it like that
I wouldn't even say that WW1 is talked about properly
WW2 is talked about basically every year
Austrian history class is not much better than American history class, with the difference that ours focuses on how shitty our country is
Yep, not gonna argue with that
In 7 years of history classes, I never had the impression of getting a complete overview of the history of humankind, but rather each teacher taught the part that they found interesting personally
let me live with the celts of Bad Dürnberg and Hallstadt, but before they were going south to piss of some romans
i really want to learn more about them, and since those guys didnt write their own history, i probably would see alot cool things nobody knew about them
High middle ages, 1100-1200 type time period
Would just be fascinating
I'd probably visit Vienna sometime during the 19th century, when it was still the capital of a great empire
Can you elaborate
Oof, pretty bad decision in hindsight
I don‘t know a single national anthem
Well, the Austrian one kind of, the first part, but otherwise not really
People don’t flex here at all
It’s almost illegal so to say
Same as Germany
We don't want people to know about our private lives
"Soko Kitzbühel", a police procedural set in the Tyrolean alps
It ran for 20 years, the last episode of around 265 will run in may
Tom Turbo has more episodes
A total of 407
That's rookie numbers
Am dam des ran for 3986 episodes
:O How could I not think of Tom Turbo ...
People from Vorarlberg are hard to understand, but it is usually manageable for me, as I'm from the neighbor state (Tyrol)
Viennese for instance do not stand a chance at understanding them
I have the same problem with the swiss - I understand it, but my brain needs a second to process the sentence I just heard and comprehend what they were saying
So it is possible but not without difficulty
A dialect I and barely anybody I know understands: Vorarlberger dialect
Probably because it‘s more closely related to Swiss german than any other Austrian dialect
And for accents: I‘m bad at accents anyway
If your accent happens to be anything that isn‘t a german accent there‘s a 99% chance I won‘t understand you because I‘m pretty stupid
I speak German
so many dialects i don't understand at all
Joa Wienr künnen üsnmeistens nid verstoh, denn wirds komisch wenn plötzlich hochdütsch reda muasch
Aba I studier in Innsbruck und ihr Tiroler hond o an schwera Dialekt, da rest fu Österreicg vertsnad i jo no guat aba bei eu wirds a jle schwera, vorallem süd udn sot tiroler
Schwizer gond eigentlich meistens zum verstoh, isch jo o allemanlisch
Are you sure that he didn‘t say anything along the lines of juten as in guten (juten Morgen, juten Tag or some shit like that) and not actually Juden
Idk I‘m just making a best case scenario right now while never having heard of Badisch tbh xD
Switzerland is a very weird place when it comes to languages, which makes it the more interesting if I‘m honest here
Now I‘m intrigued
do you actually speak standard german
Because I think it‘s quite rare to find somebody that grew up in Austria and lives in Austria to not have a dialect, like, at all (or overall find a german native that doesn‘t have a dialect at all)
I come from Niederösterreich and grew up bilingual (hungerian-german) and moved to Wien
I don't understand Tirolerisch, Kärntnerisch, Burgenland-isch(?), Vorarlbergerisch und Schweitzer dütsch
I mean what means "Hiafla
Hiafla ist ein Trottel :‘D but tbh I‘ve never heard that either (Am styrian lol)
Yes
"Steiermarkerisch" i don't get either
Steirisch  and I don‘t get lower Austrian dialect on the other hand, it‘s a „I know it but it sounds so foreign“-feeling
It still snows every winter
But in the city, not as much as it used to
Barely anymore
It snowed on Saturday in upper Styria for a day
Now we‘re happy when we see snow at the beginning of January
Sometimes we have snow at the end of February or beginning of March
It‘s sad
South-Eastern Austria here, last year in November we had record-breaking snowfall here
I'm talking once every 75 years
In only one day, my entire district (and some other neighbouring districs) was affected by blackouts, roadblocks, and potwntial avalanches
I've never seen anything like that
But, for the rest of winter we had almost no snow at all
I've noticed this trend over the last few years
Heavy snowfall before and after Winter, but hardly any during it
Which, living in the alps, obviously didn't use to be like that
Yeah I think last year it snowed once in here in Vienna iirc
We haven't got much snow in the years prior to that as well, but at least a few times, even if it is gone in a day or two
I think it really depends on the employer, but as far as I know are piercings not really accepted if you work in a bank or as attorney or jobs like that
From my experience I can say I work in a hospital in administration and so far nobody has said anything about my septum piercing
Pretty much a non-issue at this point
Maybe not in banks and higher-class establishments, but fuck em
It really depends what kind of work you do
In healthcare (think nurses for example) it's either forbidden or at least very much encouraged not to have piercings
Both for hygienic reasons as well as safety reasons (think of aggressive patients trying to rip them off etc
Same for police, guards, etc
They don't wear ties cause they could be joked, same with piercings
Mostly safety reasons
If you work a job that involves interacting with customers it depends
Banks and such probably would prefer if you don't have those, some don't care
If you work some "regular" or "boring" office job behind the scenes it is probably accepted
True, do you show your Septum on your application picture
I am wearing snakebites since 16 and i always showed it on mine
I didn't have the septum yet when I applied for the job, I actually got it one month after I started the job
But I'd probably show it if I had to apply for a new job
Almost all of Europe uses dots and/or spaces for thousands and commas for decimals
Only UK and 1-2 other countries do it otherwise
I am using the German style here
What I never was aware of is my wrong use of the "`" in English
Like: Writing "I´m" instead of "I'm", but that simply is because of the German keyboard layout and I´m too used to the wrong one
no thousand separators because they might mess things up and points for decimal
Although in German you would use a comma
I just use spaces for 1000 seperators and whatever I wanr for decimals
> Only UK and 1-2 other countries do it otherwise
And science and technology
so how do you count
here it's, in steps of 1
000:
Million - Milliarde - Billion - Billiarde
another quick question, do you actually write the currency symbol before the amount
over here it's "1,55 €" (unlike English where it's "$1
55")
glad you asked, I also just thought about that
here the use of the currency symbol is standardized in an ÖNORM, it is to be treated as a replacement of the word, so it goes behind the number and with spaces: 1,55 €
the American way ($1
55) would be incorrect, because you also wouldn't write "Dollar1
55". it is permissible in tables and such, where you're not writing a full sentence and trying to get everything evenly placed, but personally even there I'd prefer to write it with a space (€ 1,55)
Don´t think so
For the correct ' I have to hit shift-# and for the ´ I only have to hit the key next to the backspace
But I guess mainly it´s about being used to it
this and that all the names of functions change, ugh
still can never remember SVERWEIS, think it's SLOOKUP
From a mathematical point of view
Why
10^9 works for both - milliard and billion
Maths doesn't care what you call 10^9, it doesn't change based on what you call it
If you continue that train of thought, it wouldn't make sense to call 10^3 ten hundred either
Either you have specific (in the sense of the short scale) words for each 10^x or you don't. Both are fine, it just depends on what you're used to and if you communicate in another language, it should be clear what you mean, but both work
so the long system, but without separate names for the "thousands of". interesting
also the direction changes, while in English it's 66-99, in German it's 99-66 (that's how it should be, ultimately depends on the font though)
**„example“**
According to the wiki article, specifically the british and the french
Most of us just used what the french were already using
»Guillemets« are an acceptable middle ground
That's an excellent point I hadn't even considered
Thanks for pointing it out
ok I think I want it to be written like 1•000•000„65 now
actually, quotation marks are always quotation marks, and the ones used to just quote are also the ones used to *ironically* quote something
above-above is just an English/internet/keyboard convention, and doesn't have to do anything with the meaning
I think you're just too lose to France ;)
we write them like »this«, not like « this »
only used in literary works though
I guess it depends if you are in a bigger city or in the rural areas
Nobody really cares about it
> I haven't entered a church since I was in lower school :/
Same for me until a wedding some years ago
I was shocked by how brainwashed people react and that I still knew all those things you are supposed to say because it was drilled into our brains at very young age
No one would allow this if it would be a new thing instead of "part of our culture"
Not in the balkans
Beeing orthodox, catholic or muslim is often synonymous for beeing serb, croat or bosniak
Especially for the generation that lived through the civil wars in the 90s.
You can‘t be catholic AND a serb, according to, well every serb, croat, etc
I ever talked to
During communist times people didn‘t really bother with religion, but many kept their religious customs anyways because the Yugoslav government wasn‘t so hard crushing on religion as the eastern block (remember, Yugoslavia was not under the „control“ of the Soviet Union - the army was always prepared for an invasion, be it from the west or the east)
PS: I‘m a serb myself
I don‘t believe in god but I don‘t really care too much about it, and I‘m probably not going to tell my parents that
Why
Well it‘s none of their business and they don‘t bother me with religious stuff anyway
I live in Austria and people generally don‘t care what you believe in
He has big ears, and we often make fun of them
People sometimes joke about Sebastian Kurz because of the cult of personality surrounding him
He and the other ministers communicate very elusively, it's like trying to put a nail in Jello
During the government crisis in May people joked that our president's true love is our Constitution because he couldn't stop praising it's "elegance".
He has giant ears, and, since he is so young, there's often jokes along the line of him still being a student
['member this nice poem
Don't forget the world famous Basti-haircut and the fact that he is actually just 8 years old
[Look how cute he is with his ears
That and hes already twice divorced
I think he looks very gnomy
Private Kyle
Interesting question
In high German I pronounce it with an s, but in my German dialect it's sh, like all s.
Hebrew for sure, absolutely fascinating language
Then probably italian so i could finally take my mum on the trip around rural italy shes always wanted to go on
And i think either arab or maori, also just because i like the languages
I am already learning Italian, but only for about a year and on duolingo, so this kind of counts as my first pick already
Italian is such a beautiful language
Next is Croatian
I know a few Croatians who it'd be cool to impress, also I could finally understand all the serbian dialogue in Vienna (it's not thaaat much, but you hear it from time to time)
Well I guess if I'm already at it, Spanish would be cool too
Sounds great just like Italian and I could watch some films/series without subtitles
Japanese, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese (currently studying)
I'm already pretty fluent in english, german and slovenian are my native tongues, so russian (also currently studying) is relatively easy so far
>Spanish because it can be useful in the world
Also in the worst case you can just pack your things and make camp in the 17th bundesland
> after English and Greek haha
You don't speak English and Greek
Yeah, but that's also kind of cheating
As far as I know sz=š, cz=c(with hacek), rz=r(with hacek) and something is probavly z(with hacek)
Holy crap, I didn't know my keyboard has so few haceks
Edit: Typo
Oh yeah, right ;)
We have to keep and maintaining them according to our state treaty
Most of them are memorials on soldiers grave yards, [like this one near me] it's kinda OK
The one big famous is the memorial on the Schwarzenberg Plaza, always confusing tourists which didn't know Austria was for 10 years occupied after the 2nd WW
We do though
We have memorial stones for the fallen soldiers in WW2 in almost every village for example
Because these were still people, these were someone's brother, father, friend
Even though they fought for the Nazis
So we should *not* celebrate the people who fought all the way down to Vienna to rid Europe of the Nazis
Defeating Nazis was a good deed
Done by brothers, fathers, uncles, neighbours, friends of someone
People
More a café thing, but also applies in bars
Please specify right away which coffee you'd like
If you're not sure, ask right away
Same thing in Austria :( We've got Wirtshäuser, but only old men go there to drink, young people only go there for meals with their parents
Completely different from pub culture
We have got bars, but they're expensive and they play loud music
At least here, the table has a special ashtray with a [Stammtisch sign] Dunno what they're going to do now that smoking is banned
oh, I tought that's how it's supposed to taste like
Since the first of November
Not in this context
More like „the usual table“.
Which is why you move the glass to a more vertical angle once you get towards the end
Perfect crowns every time
All police are armed with handguns in Austria so it's very common to see them
I guess I'm used to it because it's always been this way so it doesn't make me feel scared
Better we don't tell OP that most police cars and stations contain assault rifles too \^\^
Just that they usually stay there, without being used / carried around
Some statistics, why we don't need to be scared:
2012-2018: 37 shots were fired at people
6 people were killed, 13 wounded
The average is about 60 shots per year, most of them warning shots or to scare away animals
Austrian police is commonly equipped with Glock 17 hand guns, indeed they have Steyr Aug A3 Subcompacts and bulletproof vests in their cars and or stations but they don’t commonly carry them
I only saw them at Vienna’s Airport or on duty when protecting embassies
A large portion of Austrian police have assault rifles in the car
But they don't carry them around unless something big happened
I've seen them once when a bankrobbery was going on in town
Well at the moment there are polices officers with assault rifles in public places like train stations
That's because we probably still are in a higher terror alert state
A lot of civilians dont know the difference
Not surprising when the news reports about "fully semi automatic" weapons
There are slings for them
Exactly
Christmas 4 years ago were the attacks on the Christmas market in Germany
Thats what I meant with "something big happened".
They usually don't carry their AUGs unless the interior ministry says there is a real threat
>I don't think it's assault rifles, it's smg's.
They are definitely assault rifles
They have the Steyr AUG A3 in 5,56×45 NATO
They used to have the AUG A1 and a 9mm version of the AUG
EKO Cobra (basically SWAT) have the AUG A3 in .300 Blackout
Europe (There's the discussion regarding Eurasia in some school books
North America
South America
Africa
Asia
Australia (Sometimes, very rarely, Oceania)
Antarctica
Two Americas
Australia is a continent, New Zealand is not part of it
UK, Japan, New Zealand etc
are just not part of any continent (and in the end, "continent" is just an arbitrary human name for "huge island", in a way
Again with exceptions like Greenland)
(Ofc often names refer to vague regions, like Japan is part of Asia
But not part of the continent)
Seven continents:
•North America
•South America
•Africa
•Asia
•Antarctica
•Oceania (although many people just call it Australia which always bugged me)
•Europe
Säd america is sad
Continents are kind of arbitrary in definition
If for example you separated by tectonic plates, Eurasia would be one but India is a separate one
The question wasn't what Google says, it was what your school said
&#x200B;
I think we have established that different people have different opinions on what is a continent, and that's fine
In Vienna it has improved a lot in the last 10-15 years
Still not great but much better
Dunno about the rest of the country
Not so good
Other than all our neighbors we prohibit cycling in the forest
outside of cities it's really quite poor
and you're not allowed in the forests either (unless explicitely allowed, which in 99% of the places it isn't)
The only areas where it's slightly better is where we get a lot of tourism, but the recreational cycling infrastructure is a bit different from one that would benefit commuting
So yeah, we've got a lot to do, but I'm crossing fingers that we get a less right-wing and more progressive government sometime, that will help with that, among other things
I live in the Wachau and there are lots of bike routes for getting around without having to drive on car streets
I don‘t think we have family gatherings
At least I’ve barely ever heard of family gatherings (I thought it was an american thing
) and my family doesn‘t really have contact with my aunts and uncles, since my mom is polish (and none of us, except my mom, can speak polish) and my one aunt on my dads side who lives in Austria lives in a different federal state had a big argument with my dad so now they stopped talking
Is it because your clan holds some secret recipe or something
I always love this:
Wenn Fliegen über Fliegen fliegen fliegen Fliegen Fliegen nach
Word by word: If flys over flys fly fly flys flys after
Literally: If flys fly over flys, flys fly after flys
With the same word 5 times in a row it still makes perfekt sense, and shows how important capitalisation is in German
> Ich bin auf Urlaub nach Italien, das Land der Römer, wo die Sonne scheint und die Zitronen blühen, gefahren
"For my vacation I have to Italy, the country of Romans where the sun is shining and the lemons bloom gone
I made that sentence up
The point is that in German verb forms like "have gone" can be split apart by any number of  dependent clauses
There's other, more reasonable ways to say things,  but the above is a perfectly legal and legible German sentence
Even Mark Twain made fun of it in a hilarious essay
**EDIT:** Alright, I added the comma, hot damn
Stop reminding me
When I miss a comma in German just use one of those I put too much in English, there's plenty to choose from
There is nothing I can say about German that Mark Twain hasn't already said and better in his [*The awful German language*]
Wenn Fliegen hinter Fliegen fliegen, fliegen Fliegen Fliegen nach
In german (and many other languages), when you combine nouns, you lose the space in between
So Obst+Schale (fruit+bowl) makes Obstschale (fruit bowl)
Now what makes this fun is actually adding more than two nouns
You can do as many as you want
My personal favourite from recent history would be the Bundespräsidentenstichwahlwiederholungsverschiebung
(postponement of the redial of the run-off for the federal president)
"umfahren" is the opposite of "umfahren"
Edit: in Austria, "ausrasten" means to relax, in Germany, "ausrasten" means to loose your shit over something
Same in Austria and it makes perfect sense, although there are some people from the country side who don't seem to get the 8:15 part or 8:45 while they use the 8:30 part as "half nine".
Yeah no one would use it
In that sentence there are a lot of pieces you can abbreviate very easily
Instead of saying
>.. eine Kurve, die scharf war, ...
(a turn which was sharp)
you can simply say
>eine scharfe Kurve
(a sharp turn)
You can also rearrange the different parts of the sentence so it's less interleaved
So instead of
>Er sagte, nachdem er das Haus, welches in der Straße, die eine Kurve, die scharf war, hatte, stand, sah, "oh".
you could say
> Er sagte "oh" nachdem er das Haus sah, das in einer Strasse mit einer scharfen Kurve stand
>proper German you'd say "in Urlaub"
Austrian standard German is proper German
Its our standard German and grammatically correct
They are not reversed
"Half nine" means we are half the way through the ninth hour
"Quarter Nine" means we are a quarter through the ninth hour and "three quarter nine" means we are 3 quarters through the ninth hour
Try to read a German textbook on a complicated matter
I am in engineering and professors often tell us to get American literature, because many German professors just want to show off how intelligent they are and how long they can go on with a single sentence
I mean some people in Austria actually say "quarter before" and "quarter after" but yeah, I get where you are coming from, but still "quarter to nine" can also be understood that we are a quarter hour along on the way to nine
No one in Austria would understand "three quarters nine" as 8:15 and the confusion usually is only with "quarter 9" and some people see that as 9:15 or "viertel ueber (Neun)".
General history:
* Habsburg family
* -> Maria Theresia
* -> Franz Ferdinand
* -> Marie Antoinette
* Peter Rosegger (Poet, Author)
* Engelbert Dollfuß (dictator in Austria while Hitler was dictator in Germany)
Music:
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
* Johann Strauß & Johann Strauß Sohn (father & son)
* Franz Joseph Haydn
Psychology:
* Sigmund Freud (even though born in Czechia, he grew up in Austria
Not particularly history but still pretty known:
* Arnold Schwarzenegger (38th governor of California, former bodybuilder, actor, producer, businessman)
* Dietrich Mateschitz (Founder of Red Bull, richest Austrian)
* Daniel Svarowski (Name pretty unknown but the brand Svarowski is quite known)
There are also personalities like **Friedrich Hundertwasser** many people have heard of but by far not everyone
(Also they may be regional)
There are also people like **Sissi/Elisabeth** whom I didn‘t include because even though she reigned Austria and is Austrian in everyones heads, even has „von Österreich“ (from Austria) in her name she was born in Bavaria
(Honestly I just wasn‘t sure if I should include her or not, so I just wrote down her name here
I tried listing as many known names as possible, I may have missed some but I do think I got the top of the top
Maria Theresia
Maximilian, The last Knight
Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico
Sigmund Freud
Alfred Adler
Mozart
Gustav Klimt
Franz Schubert
Haydn
We did it
The Germans finally claim Hitler to be their citizen
Rosegger is someone whom IMO the younger generations of Austrians have never heard of
The problem that any attempt of listing well-known people will run into is that people who arent interested in politics and history do exist
And teenagers don't have much knowledge yet
Maria Theresia and Franz Joseph are probably the "big ones" when it comes to rulers
May as well include Hitler since he used to be an Austrian before denouncing it
Post-WW2 Kreisky is probably the only politician that everyone knows
I would list Thomas Brezina as an example of someone who is well known to young people, but also known to exist to older folk
And, for eccentric reasons, Richard Lugner
Next to Schwarzenegger is probably Christoph Waltz (not as iconic though)
Some sports people probably as well, like Dominic Thiem, or Niki Lauda
Though athletes tend to fall out of public consciousness after a while
Same thing with musicians: Andreas Gabalier is well known right now, and Falco and Udo Jürgens are still well known - but they will probably be forgotten in a few decades
Maybe General Radetzky too
Beethoven
I feel like the vast majority has heard his name or at least a scrap of one of his symphony‘s names
(Not sure if he‘s as known because well, everyone around here knows Mozart and knowing his biggest enemy is kinda - well - a given too)
As for Rosegger: I‘m 16
He‘s well known
For what is kinda unknown, but his name, along with often his birth place, Krieglach, is known
Idk if you meant people younger than me, but he is known
I‘ve heard of Thomas Brenzina once in my life, and that‘s because my german friends talked about him
I‘ve never heard his name before and would‘ve probably gone on never knowing his name up until this point
I think I included the „some are regional“ specifically because of Rosegger
I‘m Styrian
Also I doubt Mozart will fall out of history just like that in the next decades
Ah, yeah the regional nothing could also be true about Brezina, probably more well known in Vienna
And regarding musicians, obviously I didnt mean Mozart :P
I don't think Brezina is regional to Vienna
But I think it's more of a generational gap
I for example grew up with Tom Turbo and the Knickerbocker Bande and I live in Tyrol
Well we never know, maybe I‘m wrong and Mozart will be forgotten by tomorrow :‘)
Weird flex but ok
I think our equivalent are german tourists getting killed by cows
Absolutely
Standard MO: They enter a enclosure with a dog on a leash, come close to a Mother who has calved
The Mother charges at the dog, tourist refuses to let him go (which she should absolutely do, a dog can easily evade a cow)
The Bereaved sue the farmer
It happens a lot
I'm only able to speak it fairly well, because when I was 12 I really wanted to play Yu-Gi-Oh and all the cards were only available in English
Similarly, I wanted to read the newest Harry Potter books as soon as they were released, so I at the very least had to be able to at least read English reasonably well
Nowadays I do not care whether I speak German or English, but depending on the context I might just be more expressive in English than I would be speaking German
I don't like English
The pronounciation and spelling is pure chaos
The sound of the language is ok
Not bad or good
I also hate people who use English words in German
But that is just my opinion, please don't take it personal
I like my dialect a lot more than standard German and I like German more than English
Can't say I'm a fan
English is imprecise compared to German and feels constricting
On top of that pronunciation and spelling are nothing less than a mess
I use it only if i have to i.e. work and internet things
Otherwise i try to avoid it whenever i can, i think it is a quite ugly language
I agree with the point that it's not very precise
Technical instructions for example or law texts are so much better in German for example
Gee, it's almost if it's a German brand name (based on a French (?) name) and is actually pronounced differently
That is one good analogy
I speak an austro-bavarian dialect, but I like every dialect more than standard German
The only problem is understanding the dialects, but for me every one has something special in it that standard German is lacking
I understand that standard German is necessary for communication, the same for English
We had already 2 month of school before summer holidays, was not really a problem
More worrisome is they have no details nor any measurements planed, especially when the flu and common cold season is here again I guess there will be panic reaction from our politicians
Personally I feel quite safe
Going to school with a bunch of 15/16 year olds is really nice, because they understand the situation and comply
Also, I don‘t have any people that are at risk in my family ~~andmydadtoldmehewouldn‘tcareifIdiedbecauseofthevirusbecauseIwould‘vediedanywaysoIdon‘tcareeither~~
I’m a student, my school’s organization for the lockdown as well as the months after was horrible
While kids my age are usually civilized enough for the corona crisis, some of the teachers were a big problem
It’s just horrible to see how issues at school are barely ever treated as real issues just because they don’t cost money
If anything the "solution" is to give the schools even less money than they already get and definitely less than they need and deserve
"Austrians are like [Punschkrapferl] Red at the outside, brown at the inside and always a little drunk
" - Allegedly Thomas Bernhard
"Well, we must recognise that he was not member of the SA, but only his horse
\- Fred Sinowatz's sarcastic remark when it came to light that the former Secretary-General of the United Nations Waldheim was member of the SA (Sturmabwehr; a predecessor to the Nazi SS) and when he was confronted with an [Old Foto] where Waldheim was in SA uniform sitting on a horse and still told people that he wasn't part of the organization
There's also a saying comparing former Nazis who joined the SPÖ (social democratic party) after WWII to Punschkrapferl: “red on the outside, brown on the inside”
Blühende Landschaften voller brauner Blumen more like it
The East has gotten a raw deal because of a boggled reconstruction policy and Germany reaps the rewards for chances not taken today -_-
Here in Austria, we have quite a noteworthy Romanian community (around 80000)
I feel like Romania is generally viewed as a more impoverished country and often associated with gypsies and cheap labor (lots of workers come here)
Both places also share some history, since Romania was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
Despite these prejudices, Romania is a truly gorgeous country
I'd love to visit Sibiu one day
The first thing people would think of are "gypsies", and most of the beggars around here are assumed to be of such origin
So not very good
I visited Romania twice so far, and I was positively overwhelmed each time
Such a beautiful country with a plethora of culture to experience
I met so many nice and welcoming people there
It is sad that although geographically we aren't that far apart the common image about Romania is so wrong
Whenever Romania comes up in a conversation, people also believe it is highly unsafe to go there
I do my best to prove them wrong by telling them about my travels :)
One thing though, your rail network is in dire need of improvements
Source of a steady flow of medical doctors, business(wo)men and beggars that come to Austria
Romanians do the jobs Austrians dont want to
From prostitute to elderly care to farmwork
Thats Austria

Doch
Ist das so
My little village has a castle from first mentioned in the 13th century
In the beginning of18th century it was bought by a (then noble) family which overhauled it in baroque style and lives in it still now
The son of the current owner does ongoing Renovations currently
Graz has many but the most popular should be its clock tower
It has its current style since 1560 and was part of a bigger castle and fortress
But the French sieged it during the 5rh coalition war until the ceasefire of Znaim happened and the fortress has to be given up
It was planned to raze tthe whole fortress with the clock tower, but the people of Graz paid a ransom/bribe that the tower would be left alone
For Salzburg it's definitely the Hohensalzburg Fortress overlooking the city
Stephen's cathedral, Schönbrunn castle, and some more
I'd say the whole barrio del Carmen as well
In dialect there is Schlägl, whichs could be translated to "punchy"
~~The Hammer of a Miner is called "Bergeisen" which literrally translates to "Mountain Iron"``~~
Edit: i got confused, the Bergeisen ist the chisel, Afaik it's the hammer is also called Schlägl/Schlegl
Hammer in German is just Hammer, pronounced somewhat hard
In my Austrian dialect (west Austria) it’s something like „huma“ which is also quite soft
So I guess it’s not German or Austrian dialect
Don't forget about "Fäustel" which somewhat derives from 'fist ' but it sounds close to its diminutive
Austrian German prefers the diminutive
How is „szajs“ - pronounced ? Cause in Vienna we have „schas“ - which means „fart“ or something is shitty
Ah ok - yeah Schas doesn’t have the ei sound
I am 26 and living in Vienna
I am able to save about 400€ a month but I have a lot of hobbys and I‘m not really frugal
I would say in theory with a bit of a smaller apartment and more frugal lifestyle, 1k would be possible
Would love to be 25 again, so this is educated guesswork for the Austrian situation in one of the four larger cities and Vienna
So this goes for someone with a masters degree in a field with higher pay fresh from university
Wage: 3
000 before taxes so around 2
100 EUR after taxes and an additional christmas and holiday gratification of 4
800 EUR ( Austrians get 14 payments a year with a tax discount on the 13th/14th wage)
A municipal flat or condo flat will cost you about 500 to 800 EUR
A privatly rented one about 1
000 EUR
Costs of living tend to be high for food, cheap for public transportation
So I'd guess that you might save around 300 a month if you live cheaply or might just scrape by in Vienna if you are not eligible for a subsidized flat
In western cities Salzburg and Innsbruck it is worse and might need your 13th and 14th wage to come by
I'm 26 and I got my whole apartment and car stuff covered easily, but on top of that I'm saving next to nothing
I did when I was younger but now I can't be bothered anymore and I just *live* instead
Can't really say anything about after university degree, but 10 years ago when I started working immediately after having finished high school, I still lived at home and commuted to the city
Monthly expenses were for the train, food, and chipping in at home with costs for the household, I earned ~1300€+200€ bonus and paid about 500€, so I could save ~1000€ per month
That is 80% of the Western world
Weapons grade consumerism
People buy fucking couches and TVs on loans
It's mind boggling
IIRC Slovenia's economy is among the fastest growing economies in the EU
And they really deserve it
I was earning in Romania around 1300 after taxes while studying for my master degree
Both were full time
As a person with a technical degree from Uni (which is what OP seems to be asking), saving 400€ per month is not much
Definitely this
I make around 1900-2000€ and I'm studying on the side, so that's technically without a degree
Yeah
mylah91 said:
>Some could save a lot, but they spend everything
And I said it's even worse, many even spend money they don't have
Well ofc it depends on the lifestyle, but if you are single & live in a small apartment and have 1 or 2 average hobbies, saving 1000€ per month is pretty standard I'd say
E.g. earn 2300€ net - 700€ rent, 300€ food, 300€ hobbies
Owning a car however means saving a lot less of course
> Already above standard for Austria
as I stated above, I am talking with a technical degree from Uni
> Mostly not a choice either in Austria
What do you mean
That you need a car
If you live in the countryside, yes, but a lot of people (most people
) live in cities, where you can use public transport and bicycles
And no, I am not Viennese
Viennas public transport system is the best, but you can get by with it fine in a lot of cities
And if you are trying to make a point about the Netherlands being better for bicycles, you are right, but again, you can get by fine with a bicycle in a lot of Austrian cities, and in fact, most uni students do
Vienna would actually become bearable
Well, wouldnt be much change in our case
Apart from Vienna being quite empty and Graz would face some serious issues
Austria would stop hating the north and start hating the south
And it would become more nationalistic since now there are those anoying "northerners" on the border
Yeah, suddenly all of austria would hate graz instead
Replacing Viennese with Carinthians would NOT be an Improvement
> riots in supermarkets
Just imagine all the chaos in Aldi
I mean austrians would finally own a beach again
Less friendly nepotism, more blatant corruption
true
Denmark is just Switzerland but from a bizarro parallel universe
Mountain kraut, lol
> it's just that they were young and fearless
It's mostly the 24 hour news coverage
Its not exclusive to Italy, its happening world wide
Its much safer now pretty much everywhere in the Western world than it was in the last 50 years
But nowadays every single rape, robbery and murder gets put on the news and it makes us feel less safe
Yes, same here
I actually like them a bit softer than al dente - but you have to have good quality pasta so it is not mushy (but I know you wrote you like it that way)
When our son just started eating we bought Barilla on purpose because that stuff gets very mushy
Fun fact: Many Austrians believe that good quality pasta contains egg and bad quality pasta does not
Yes
Jtsigx igciz kg igcizit If kg kgigufugjf ich If kg oh kg it t auto moderator dumb
quick question: spaghetti, break them once in the middle or leave them long
might have to add, I learned it from an Italian
As a chef this also bothers me as rule number one when boiling is always to wait until its really boiling
Edit: before I get shit about the inaccuracy of my post to clarify: number one rule when you don't want the taste to go too much into the water
al mascellare
*scribbling down notes*
thankfully our selection of Italian products is really not that bad; what a great country to have as a neighbor
It is because of marketing
There is this brand of egg containing pasta that really pushed this agenda and a lot of people really believe now that this brand is superior because of eggs
Why the hell would you not salt it
Somewhere in between
What I would do is try it with medium bubbles and look at the result and then adjust the time from the same point that you used for your first measurement
So for myself i know that my eggs need 4min10 to be exactly the way I like them from the point where they cook like the way they did when I first made them
Also for eggs you never really want the water to go absolutely crazy as it might crack the eggs
We partly have German television and it's kinda interesting to see the differences and what's basically a copy of the German version
*ahem* Dancing Stars *ahem*
Well why do you not just dig a hole then
I only know of them from US tv shows and movies
Wouldn't make much sense in German, for the same reason most people here already stated
If you hear a German word, you usually know how to write it
There are some inconsistencies, but no huge surprises
It's called 'Buchstabierwettbewerb' in German, and I think it would make much sense with either long composite words or loan words which don't adhere to german spelling rules
There are plenty of either
The President is a popular vote, If No canditate gets over 50% there is another election Just between the two strongest canditate
The chancelor isn't directly voted, the Parties who Form the government after the General election decide who will be chancelor
Usually it's the Party Leader of the strongest Party, but it doesn't have to be
Depends on who you say our leader is
The chancellor of course is the head of government
He is elected trough the parliamentary elections
In that election you vote for a party, and the candidate of that party (usually the head of the party) will become chancellor in case of victory AND if the president instructs him to form a government (which of course usually happens)
But theoretically if the winner of the elections fails to form a coalition to get over 50% the president could instruct e.g. party number two to form a government
If the party succeeds it could happen that the top party is not in the government and the head of party number two will become chancellor
But if something like this happened, it would rather come to new elections, although it happened in 2000 when the negotiations to form a coalition lead by the top party at the time failed and party number two and three formed a coalition and the head of party number three became chancellor
The president, however, is directly elected
To be elected president you need to have the simple majority, so at least 50,1%. In the last election we had 5 (I believe) candidates so we had a first round of voting in which no candidate got the 50,1% so it got into another election where the top two candidates from the first election were against each other so one had to get the simple majority
Sooo something like [that
I really envy our neighbors for their democracy
I don't think our system in Austria is bad, but far less democratic
I really like our dual-leadership system
The government crisis after the Ibiza-Affair showed quite well why having a president besides the government is important
It's always better to split power so that both bodies can control each other
Actually the president alone decides upon the chancellor and ministers
In practice they can be removed by the parliament, so typically a majority in the parliament "strongly suggests" to the president who should be in which position who usually just takes that list and chooses them
>The chancelor isn't directly voted
Just adding that the chancellor is appointed by the president
The President basically can pick any Citizen over 16 to be Chancellor
I have no idea how society views that
I can't say that I myself experienced much pressure from my family but then again I disappointed most expectations they had towards me, so it might just be them giving up
**Vorarlberg**: Weird Swiss people, basically disconnected from the rest of the country
Linguists still aren't sure what kind of language they use
**Tyrol**: Nationalist mountain people who only care about themselves and some weird tiny Italian province
Can't pronounce anything besides kchchchchch
**Carinthia**: Nazis
**Salzburg**: Bavarians
**Upper Austria**: Bavarian Nazis, but on Crystal Meth
**Styria**: Pumkin-seed oil addicted people who think Graz is a city
Their dialect sounds like barking
**Burgenland**: Some incredibly flat third world dystopia
Not much to do there besides drinking wine, being a Nazi or swimming in some muddy lake
**Lower Austria**: Has been a dictatorship for the last 27 years (God Emperor Pröll first and now his proxy Hanni, the mother of a few of his children)
Probably the most generic part of Austria
The guys with basement kids
**Vienna**: Stuck up and arrogant pricks who can't drive and think of the rest of the country as some backwards hellhole
I, a citizen of Vienna, can only endorse the stuff about Vienna
I can confirm
I am a Viennese, can't drive and think that the rest of the country is backwards hellhole
But the rest of the country IS a backwards hellhole xD
It should also be noted that half of the states had only governors from one party since people voting in Austria was a thing
I mean Vienna is a backwards hellhole as well after all :p
Are you stuck up and arrogant
Do you live in 1942
(even though I don't consider Alto Adigians to be Austrians either for that matter)
Ask the backwards hellhole
Vorarlberg, the Tyrol and Upper Austria have been black since the 1870s.
Vienna had CS/VF governors
That's true
Most of us are friendly as fuck
Considering our current politics I wouldn't consider us civilized in any sense, but alright
Good Point my dear third world fascist <3
>I mean why can't you just see Germany as the older brother
Austria is older than Germany :p
>as far as I know most Germans have no problem with Austrians
It's more like they never think about us because Austria is utterly irrelevant to most Germans
And while I don't hate Germans or Germany (pretty much the opposite actually) I don't see a reason why we should work more closely together just for the sake of speaking the same language
Both of our countries are part of the EU already, that's enough
The CS/VF was there to indicate that its basically the same party
I mean it's not like we are any better lmao
>With older brother I meant that Germany is bigger and it's economy is superior than Austria's.
Call them our bigger step-cousin and we are down ;D
>other German people apparat from Austrians and Piefkes as well ;)
All Germans are Prussians
Spoke with my southern tyrolean neighbor
People bad at geography in Italy just consider everything north non-italian speaking German
Doesnt matter if its the Swiss, Austrians or the Germans
I'd choose Czechia tbh
We already work really closely with Germany anyway
I like to go shopping in Germany
It's so close, I can even drive over the border with my bike
Totally normal
In western Austria there is that one region called „Deutsches Egg“ (German Corner)
It’s a part of Germany where you travel through if you go from the state of Tyrol to the state of Salzburg
Many people do it daily as they live in Tyrol but live in Salzburg (or vice versa)
I’m also quite fond of street cycling and when I’m on a long tour (say 200km) I always end up in Germany
I honestly love it
It’s great to hop in your car and just drive and be in another country
It’s also great for school trips
With my high school I went to Switzerland, Germany, Italy (Rome), France (Paris), London and Latvia
It’s great honestly
as to your last question, not necessarily
next capital (bratislava) is about an hour by car, or an afternoon trip by bike away
offers great food, cheaper prices, nice outdoor areas to explore, all in a completely different country and language
and in my whole life, I've been exactly once
I guess when things are that close it's just normal and not specifically travel-worthy
or maybe it's because we're reluctant to travel long distances
saw my grandparents only once a year during summer holidays because they lived "far away", far away in this case meaning you'd be in the car for 2
5 hours
I guess many people just tend to stay in the area they live in, because nobody likes to spend a lot of time in a car
We need a translator (or several) without leaving the country
>I can get on a plane in Atlanta and fly for 6 hours to Seattle, and when I get off the plane everything is more or less the same
Same language with the same accent, same restaurants and cafes, same shops, same street signs and general layout - it’s pretty crazy imo
I can drive 2 hours, stay in my state and won't understand the people there
Dialects that formed over hundreds of years in the mountains are crazy man
wow, really puts it in perspective
I live in the country's capital, and could take an afternoon bike trip to be in another capital altogether: different country, different language, etc
still I hardly ever go, guess what you can easily have is never that special, haha
Europe is pretty much the opposite, at least within the Schengen agreement countries
There are no border checks, you drive down the road, come across a sign "welcome to (country)" and you're suddenly in a country with a different culture, language and the road signs look kinda weird
Dude, no offense, but in some areas of your eastern parts
"If you are an EU national, you do not need to show your national ID card or passport when you are travelling from one border-free Schengen EU country to another
Even if you don't need a passport for border checks within the Schengen area , it is still always highly recommended to take a passport or ID card with you, so you can prove your identity if needed (if stopped by police, boarding a plane, etc
Schengen EU countries have the possibility of adopting national rules obliging you to hold or carry papers and documents when you are present on their territory
Driving licences, post, bank or tax cards are not accepted as valid travel documents or proof of identity
([source]
Those are incredibly common in Austria as well
I've one too, I love the Coffee from it and could simply Put in the wood stove If it's currently burning
I prefer the heat from these to the central heating
I do agree that the central heating is easier in your own house
If you a in a house with multiple flats, it gets more complicated
We've socket protectors as well
The [old ones] are glued into the socket and you have to twist the plug 90° to be able to plug it into the socket
The [new version] is prebuilt into the socket
My Austrian grandmother had a bidet, and apparently it was quite modern when she installed it somewhen in the 60s. At some point it fell out of fashion and I don't know any lately built house to have one
It gains a little bit more publicity as a zero waste alternative nowadays
One issue with my grandmothers bidet might have been, that it was a seperat thing
So you would have to wiggle with you pants down and your bare butt exposed across the bathroom (toilet and bidet still in the same room next to each other of course)
I never used it, because no one explained how to use it and I wasn't eager to try it out as a kid
It is fascinating that in Italy it is now mandatory to have one installed
You have to push both pins in at the same time for it to open
There's some plastic blocking the entry and push down by a spring
I tried forcing one open with a screwdriver (the one to check for electricity) and couldn't do that
But plugs work easily
Teabags are very, very common
The one thing we don't get around here are circular teabags, and those huge 100 bag boxes
Sounds like a Swedish answer, haha
Jk, I think we would just use sponges or brushes to clean the sink
Also reusable
edit; I guess it's not to clean the sink
Not really
Most just have two holes
I can recommend GommeHD
net and Rewinside
tv (Hypixel-Like), play
timolia
de (JnRs and straight PvP mainly), uwmc
de and nocoords
com (survival), NeruxVace
net (hardcore Bedwars)
It is
150-200 ping here in Upperaustria
Maybe it's me, but I can't stand the lag
Additionally Hypixel is sometimes somewhat buggy, wich is why i stopped playing anything but Skyblock
Proper building regulations to tackle land consumption
We have horrible [suburban sprawl] where you can't be in nature without seeing a building (except mountains and north eastern Austria)
After Corona: wearing face masks like the japanese when you are sick
To show you respect other peoples health
I work as a receptionist and I am so done being coughed at and getting sick because desinfectting your hands after shaking them is/was frowned upon
I'd like to see a Vulcano in Austria, like
Etna or Fuji-san
I do miss a lot of reptiles here
You cannot get some snakes like western hognoses (I know of exactly one breeding pair in the country) or garter snakes here, but they are super common in the US
The same with milk snakes and BCIs but they are occasionally on sale(maybe once a year)
You can get reticulated pythons, burmese pythons, Green tree pythons and most tarantulas (even exotic ones like a P. striata) instantly
We also cannot get reptiles shipped
You need a licensed company(there are close to none), you need to inform the state administration, city administration and veterinary Department and the city districts administration
It is basically impossible unless you own a pet shop
I realised how fucked up your system is when German politicans and expert started to praise our system
Sorry for the German Youtube video, but I need to plug this because it's just so important
It's a clip from a German satirical show that shows how the insurance lobby persuaded German politics that private insurance is "much more efficient" than one single governmental insurance: [Die Anstalt - Versicherungslobby vs
gesetzliche Rente]
Austria's insurance lobby is trying really hard to go down the same route as well and that scares me
A lot
Agree
I don't think I've ever met any other Austrian who was even aware of this issue
It funny because the opposite is true in the west (in the mountains)
There just isn‘t enough available land that housing is allowed to be built on, yet there is a ton of open farmland/pastures
I wish the rules were more open that farmers could more easily sell parts of there land to build housing
>water fountains with sparkling water
This is the real unpopular opinion here
Like, what
At a certain point something has to give
A square meter of buildable ground is going for at least €700 (upwards of €1000 in the right location)
And I don‘t even live in a city
Housing prices have gone through the roof and it has become extremely difficult for a normal family with kids to afford housing
Even renting an apartment is crazy expensive
Austria doesn't have a mandatory insurance system like the other countries you listed
Germany has a "Versicherungspflicht", but Austria has a "Pflichtversicherung". Depending on where you are employed, you are automatically insured with a certain state owned insurance body
For some dumb reason, we just have a bunch of those and not one single insurance body for everyone
The house I live in was built in the 1880s ... and it's just a regular house of many, nothing super special
Living here (Vienna, in my case) is great, I don't see any problems because the city is "old". Infrastructure works really well and is looked after regularly
That's what happens when you have a socialist city council ;)
One of the biggest problems city developers face is how they have to build around ancient ruins when they want to build new stuff, especially in the center
But I hear this is much worse in Rome
Traffic Planing and Management usually sucks, the city centers are not made for Car Traffic
even in old cities there's newly built up areas and new buildings, but if you buy or rent an apartment in one of the old buildings (typically from the 1800s), you normally know what you're getting: possibly hard to heat and shoddy plumbing/heating system/windows installed, unless it's been completely renovated
parking space probably not included
often not wheelchair accessible, and no elevators
the stairs right behind the entrance make lugging up your bike each day to put it out in the back yard cumbersome
depending on your situation, the advantages can make up for it: nice wide doors and high rooms, central location, historic and nicely designed entrance and staircase
city-wide there's difficulties for traffic, parking space, and I guess also things like building sewage systems and subways, high maintenance cost of cobblestone roads, but these are things that you'd normally not really notice as a normal citizen (only indirectly through longer time for construction projects etc)
many of those "problems" suddenly become no problem at all if you're willing to get cars out of the city and return them to what they're intended for, pedestrian- (and bike-)friendly spaces
It creates some limits to public planning
You can't route modern traffic through medieval town centers as there might not be enough space
Creates bottlenecks on the one hand but also is more pedestrian friendly as at least the town centers are compact, naturally designed to have walkable distances
Though that clashes with modern suburbia
Apart from that having old buildings around creates a great atmosphere and sense of community
We have an old church around here that dates to the 960ties, the space around it has been the meeting place for young people for decades
Have a beer, view over the whole region, great place
Then there is a medieval castle thats a great place to take a hour long walk to
Only if you are reporting it
I guess the only time you would hear this argument is during the election for president (head of state)
Because during this election, the two people who get the most votes, face each other in a final election
We have one political party most people hate
Die Grünen (the green ones), because they‘re known for not doing the shit their party is supposed to do/stand up for
They‘re kind of in the rise right now, but even so, people really don‘t care
Well that is the effect modern media logic has had on politics
Politics is condensed to a they vs
us logic, parties are condensed to their respective leaders, the actual political movement gets sidelined
And parties have embraced this as it is much easier to sell a nice looking charismatic guy or gal than a political program
And hell do party leaders love it to be the pinacle of attention
So it is the logical conclusion that people vote for or against certain faces
It also makes political debate ever more difficult if the supporters of one side accuse the other, that they are just sheep following their leader, disregarding the opposing sides interests
You can't have political discourse if neither side accepts that there are differences of oppinion and a differences of interests
It's deeply troubling and social media amplifies it
Where you once could have a civilised debate with acquaintances over a glass of wine or beer, you are now electronically screaming at each other
No, it happens in pretty much all elections
Strategic voting is absolutely a thing
lmao
Tons of people love the green party (I don't)
And a huge part fo the country absolutely despises the openly racist FPÖ.
The Polish party system really is a weird one with both main parties having spawned from the same voting block
Apart from the rampant nationalism and revanchism (both internal and external) PIS aint't all that dissimilar from Christian Social parties in the rest of Europe, if you go back 50 or so years that is
Take Germany, the CDU/CSU basically is KO and PIS united, moderating both wings and finding commin ground
How come
I think that due to the proportional representation, you don't have to vote tactically (except for the very small <4% party voters)
So I would be grateful if you could clarify
I knew about the FPÖ but around here people are more open about hating the green party than the FPÖ (idk may be because of my dad), and I kind of assumed that that‘s the same around the country, sorry for that
The CDU is nothing like PiS
The closest equivalent to PiS is the AfD
You can criticize a lot about the Union but they would never ban abortion, destroy rule of law and endanger the neutrality of the courts
There are multiple reasons to vote strategic
Here are two examples:
Imagine you are left leaning and you really like WANDL, you could vote for WANDL and hope they get into the parliament
Or you could vote for the SPÖ to get them into the coalition
Because even though you agree less with the SPÖ you'd rather have a left party in coalition than your favorite party in opposition
There is also a ton of people who don't fully agree with any party
But they rather vote for the "smaller evil" than not at all
Sounds like you live in a pretty right wing bubble to be honest
The green party is pretty succesful in all bigger cities
In rural places not so much
They are more popular with more educated and younger people
There isn't one (major) party most people dislike
If you are in the center or left, you will dislike the FPÖ and ÖVP
If you are on the right you will dislike the Greens and SPÖ. NEOS are the odd one, because they are neo-liberals, they attract progressive people from the left and economically liberal people from the right
I see, yes I also believe that there is a shortage of a true left wing party in the parliament
The greens have become more centrist and the SPÖ is a bit too old fashioned and not actually that left wing
You‘re absolutely right that I live in an extremely right wing environment, and believe me, I hate it with my whole being
And I think my dad is the center of it with always screaming his opinion, which doesn‘t make it any better
Especially his choice of party, because I really believe he‘s homophobic and yeah, I‘m in the closet
But thanks, at least I now know what the rest of Austria is up to
One valid objection that I understand is aligning the Swiss direct democratic and federalist systems with the EUs legislative process
Either it would mean the EU had to wait until there was a Swiss plebiscite on certain topics and then the 8,5 swiss would dominate decissions for 440 million people or the Swiss would have to give up certain democratic rights
Both aren't really acceptable outcomes
Schappen: On 28th December (Feast of the Holy Innocents) kids go around the village with twigs and canes and whip grown ups while chanting verses
It's supposed to keep the people healthy and fertile
The children get money or sweets for the "blessing".
It's a thing in small parts of Austria and Slovenia, but I haven't seen kids do it in my village for quite a few years now
I think I heard of that and actually did it once
Idk I know back then my brother always had those big
idk how to call them made out of twigs (Usually Palmbuschen I think
) and I had one too I think
I don‘t know if it was actually for that day, but I do know that it was around christmas or at least the holidays
I‘m really not sure, but ever since I got to do it like twice or thrice I‘ve never seen,m or heard of it again and since I was young it slowly vanished from my memory
I agree and it‘s very sad
And since english is more relevant in our daily lives denglisch also slowly becomes more popular
And I‘m not really against it, hell I‘m using the shit out of denglisch myself because I see as I slowly forget how to speak actual german, but I still think it‘s sad
Both dialects and a part of our language is vanishing
cringe
absolute cringe
In Austria it's still baby Jesus haha
Santa Claus is very present in the media, but for children it's still the "Christkindl" (baby Jesus) that brings the presents
Christkind is still around in southern germany and Austria
We even have "no power to santa" stickers
>Idk I know back then my brother always had those big
idk how to call them made out of twigs (Usually Palmbuschen I think
Yeah, we also always made them out of white willow (which become Palmkätzchen in spring)
Palmbuschen are those things you make during Easter where you combine Palmkätzchen and 6 other kinds of twigs
Oh, thank you, I forgot the word for that and just assumed it was all the same
There are different traditions
In eastern Austria it tends to be a male childlike angel, though the young woman form is also found
Because Halloween is a fully commercialized holliday that is getting pushed so that some people can profit of it
And its killing other similar traditions that are not just about money
Yes, my mom is American and I have lived in the US and we used to celebrate Halloween
While Halloween is already incredibly commercialized in the US, it is nothing but a money grab in Europe
We already have our own holidays where we get into costumes and stuff
And Halloween isn't really that "amazing" or "special" when you don't have nostalgic childhood memories of it
I usually drive "auf Sicht", which means "on sight" - so if I can see far enough to stop within a reasonable time I drive the speed limit, sometimes faster
If I can't see around a tight corner I adjust my speed so that I'm able to stop in a reasonable time
> especially in areas with blind corners or hills
You have hills in Denmark
It's tought to drive so you can stop within half the distance of your sight
How do people actually drive
Some very slow, some very fast and the vast majority at adequate speeds, i guess
I'm currently living way out in the countryside in Brittany (France)
Most people do 100 km/h (legal limit is 70) on very narrow country roads bordered by bocages
Two cars can fit side-by-side but both would have to have 1 tire practically in the grass
Every corner is a blind corner, sometimes there are tractor and bikes too
Often in the morning the area is covered in fog
None of my colleagues seem to find it strange/dangerous
>Is there a "law" in Germany where you have to give priority for the car going upwards
I live in a hilly area and I rarely see this happen
It's not law, but in the alps it's common courtesy to give the car going upwards priority
I remember in india in the mountains before blind curves, they had road signs telling you to honk
# Rainhard Fendrich - I am from Austria
It's basically like the second anthem
I read that as "morning wood" and was ready to compliment your liberal attitude
When I was little, the one cliché song for Italian settings always was "O sole mio", preferably sung by a gondoliere
Also "Funiculi, funicula".
Although I have to thank "Funiculi, funicula" for actually understanding what the Italian tourists want when they ask me for the way to the funicolare around here
The first thing I'd say when asked about an unofficial national anthem would be the [Blue Danube Waltz] especially since it was used in lieu of a de facto national anthem when Austria declared its independence in April 1945 because we simply didn't have one for the newly established Second Republic of Austria yet
Came here to say this
It absolutely is our second anthem and sums up a lot about us Austrians
The only Dutch song I know is "Zeven dagen lang" and I love it
When I was a little kid, Sweden was [Pippi Longstocking] land, but I doubt the theme song is iconic enough to represent a whole country
It's hard not to love that one, it's just so legendary
Surely Scotland the Brave should be on that list too
Song of the Volga Boatmen too, to mention another memorable and well-known Russian folk song
I really have no idea where the cliché even came from, but I remember reading somewhere that "O sole mio" gets requested by gondola tourists so often that a few years ago they considered banning it officially because it's just not a song from the region and some Venetians were quite pissed off about that
I can assure you that while people may criticize Wagner as a person, his works definitely aren't being dismissed from a musical standpoint
They're still regularly shown in venues around the world, which includes Germany of course ([Bayreuth Festival] for example)
From my own experience they are less popular with our audiences here than operas from other composers though, which may be partly due to their heavy pathos and lengthiness
several times where there are two places with similar names, except one name contains Big (Groß) and one Small (Klein)
Usually the "Small" has more people
&#x200B;
And plenty places with names that are not accurate "anymore". Eg
references to industrial places or nature things that don't exist anymore
[Fucking in Austria]
Let me tell you, it's not encouraged
Burgenland means "castle land/country", but the castle it refers too are nowadays not in Burgenland anymore, but in Hungary and Slovakia (depends what you count, it was first named "four castle country" but after Pressburg (Bratislava) became a part of Czechoslovakia, it was renamed to castle country refering to 3 castles which stayed in Hungary when part of it became Austrian)
Schneeberg, meaning snow mountain
Guess what kind of precipitation is kinda rare there (at least compared to other surrounding, higher mountains)
In Upper Austria there's town called "Leonstein" (lit
Leon's/Lion's Stone), [there's no lions there]
The Lower Austrian town of "Wiener Neustadt" (lit
Viennese New City) is not in Vienna and not that new any more, it was founded in 1194
The Styrian town "Judenburg" (Jew's Borough) has only one Jew left (afaik), and that's the one in their [Coat of Arms] The others were killed, converted or expulsed in the 14th and 15th centuries
The Nazis considered to rename the city to Adolfburg, but then the whole business with the war came in the way
>And plenty places with names that are not accurate "anymore".
Österreich (Austria) itself kinda fits that
It just comes from "Osterrichi", initially just meaning "place in the east (of the Empire)" iirc
(Though I think its also taken as "Eastern Empire/Empire in the East" on occasion
) Either way, at this point it's not an Empire, not in an Empire and it's not really the noteworthy farthest east of anything in particular either as far as I know
Styria too
"Steiermark", comes from the city of Styer and it being a "Mark" (march
), an outer border region (of an Empire)
While it is still a border state, Styer is no longer in Styria, it belongs to Upper Austria now, and there is again no Empire
Also I'm fairly sure marches are usually fortified, which isn't quite accurate anymore either
And Burgenland
Got its name for three important(?) places with "Burg" in their name, all of which are in Hungary and not a part of Burgenland
and Frauenstein does in fact allow residents of any gender as well
At least not in public
Residents do get free pornhub subscriptions though
I'm not joking
Actually 4 ..burgs, back when it was part of the Hungarian part
Pressburg (Bratislava)
Wieselburg (Mosonmagyaróvár)
Ödenburg (Sopron)
Eisenburg (Vas)
Now that region is part Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia
Also, Vorarlberg should be Hinterarlberg
There is also the town Groß klein(big small) and klein klein(small small) in southern styria
> Österreich (Austria) itself kinda fits that
It just comes from "Osterrichi", initially just meaning "place in the east (of the Empire)" iirc
(Though I think its also taken as "Eastern Empire/Empire in the East" on occasion
) Either way, at this point it's not an Empire, not in an Empire and it's not really the noteworthy farthest east of anything in particular either as far as I know
Partially correct
Austria at this time was part of the Bavarian duchy and Ostarrichi certainly was the most Eastern part of Bavarian controlled land
"Richi" didn't refer to Empire in the classical sense but rather land directly controller by a ruler
> Styer
*Steyr
The exact etymology isnt known, as far as I can tell
It's true that "richi" can also come from "realm" (as in "Herrschaftsbereich"), but it's not necessarily so and still doesn't clarify which one, though it meaning Bavaria is probably the most obvious/likely
But it's not a proven thing, exactly
The only thing that's really sure is that it was first officially mentioned as "the region that in the common(ers) language is called Osterrichi", with no further explanation (regarding what that word means, etymologically speaking) and that it is very likely (but not 100% for sure) an old Bavarian term
Like I said, it's been translated different ways over the centuries, though some of those are more likely to be right than others (Empire in the East is definitely not it, for example)
The most likely one is probably just "A place in the East of the Realm", either generally the Imperial or specifically the Bavarian one
Admittedly after checking again, Bavarian seems somewhat more likely
But to my understanding both "rihi" (ahd) and "richi" (mhd) can mean both
("Herrschaftsgebiet/bereich", more likely to be Bavaria, as well as generally "Reich", more likely to be the Empire)
I'm no expert on medieval document language though, so maybe I'm missing some detail that clarifies it for sure, but to the best of my knowledge it cant be said with complete certainty
You again
First you reject the Leberkaskrapfen and now that
I actually do
Sorry
Maybe these ppl are from countries where regional minorities seem to have a hard time
Looking at you, Spain
I am not talking about the language but the region
There have been again huge protests the last few years due to the central government trying to enforce things there
I am not talking about languages but regions
Catalan sovereignty is a huge issue of contention
yes, but my wife isn't currently working so she cooks fresh meals everyday and usually we eat together with the kids when I come from work
Imho that's the great difference from the 90's, that one income families were more common
Remember back to the 90's, my father was 3 shift working in a mine and later in glass works, which meant I didn't see him at all on some school days and some days we had the whole day time
But honestly it's also much self induced hurry, when I moved out and working in the early 2000, I took the time to cook a prober meal after 10 hours at work (paid overtime)
As someone who started working in the 1990 - I have much more quality time at my hands now than back then, tbh
Granted, we don't have that many family meals - but that's mainly because husband and I both work from home, so we're together a lot anyway
Wearing Dirndln or Lederhosen wasn't much of a thing in my part of the country until fairly recently
Same here
We have teams of de-lockers regularly visit all the bridges to cut them off to prevent bridges from collapsing
I'd say Vienna feels the most foreign to a majority of Austrians
It's much bigger than any other place here (over 1,5 Million inhabitants more than our second biggest city, Graz) and unlike most other bigger Austrian cities it's quite far away from the Alps
There's also a pronounced multicultural and especially slavic influence in Vienna due to history
It's strange as it couldn't be more Austrian but as somebody from an area close to Salzburg I would say that Vienna feels foreign, at least for me
It's so disproportionately big for a small country like Austria
It almost feels like its own city-state with its own (social/cultural) rules
Also many many small things add to this personal feeling
Zebra crossings look different in Vienna than in the rest of Austria, the climate is dryer than where I live, in the east it's really flat, there are grapevines growing (which I always associate with holidays), the trains are different (e.g. ÖBB 4020), the infrastructure is on a much bigger scale, etc
Once an old lady in Vienna asked me where I'm from and then she said "Ohhhh, Sie sind aus den Bundesländern" ("ohhh, you're from the districts") which felt like somebody from the capital of Panem said "oh, you're from one of our districts".
It feels like there is Austria and then also Vienna
Like they would be separated
Technically the Vienna Forest, particularly Leopoldsberg, is the very last northeastern tail of the Alpine Arc
So *technically* Vienna has Alps within its city limits
But I know what you mean
You mean actual mountains, not wine-hills
Still, I wouldn't say it's "far". Schneeberg isn't that far away
I was in Rotterdam, the Hague, Amsterdam and a few smaller cities and Texel back in 2019
Rotterdam was my favourite place
Yeah but most bigger Austrian cities like Graz, Linz, Salzburg and Innsbruck are in Western Austria and therefore much closer to the "real" Alps than Vienna
the second one; the first one is a general phenomenon in all german speaking countries i think
Linz is in fact much further from the Alps than Vienna
Linz is very close to the Bohemian massif (which begins beyond the Danube, but also reaches south of the Danube in the Kürnberger Wald in Leonding)
But you need to drive around 50 minutes to the south, over the great Voralpenland plain, in order to see some Alps
The people were the nicest and the weed was cheaper
The beach was pretty nice and the food was good
Overall I've enjoyed my two days in rotterdam very much
I also enjoyed Apeldoorn very much for pretty much the same reasons sans the beach
I mixed it up I meant the beach at the Hague
German is the most spoken mother language in the EU
German is just messed up Dutch
>Most other Europeans fought 2 world wars to stop this from happening
Well, not me
Mostly because I wasn't alive during that time
quick idea: let's use latin for that again
Also, a lot of Gastarbeiter already speak it (at least a bit) - so it's a good base for learners in Eastern Europe
proposition: update your *whole* orthography and we're talking
Wer sog „dös“?
Pretty sure english is one of the youngest languages
A mixture or french, germanic, norse and a tad gaelic
Latin is really hard to use in everyday life
With the verb at the end of sentences, you're listening to someone and your brain is constantly like "Spit it out, what was Cindy doing to her dog
Walking
Cuddling

Worse
giving an ultimatum to Serbia I suppose
Letting an austrian painter move to germany
Not letting that guy get into art school, twice
the Anschluss
Should be obvious
Ya'll ever heard of World War 1
ik zie het als een absolute overwinning
...and thinking we could actually fight amd win a Balkan war without it becoming a World War
This seems somehow familiar, i dont know why though
Keeping him as a bum in Vienna would be a more fitting occupation
I would say not having a general strike and bigger insurrection in 1934
Because there is no chance in hell that the Social Democrats in a democratic system would agree with the German demands
German-Catholic fascist in the conservative party trying to create a fascist state of their own and failing hard on the other hand
The alternative would be trusting the Soviets and letting them move army units to the German-Polish border like they wanted
Preferable to the Germans who tried to eradicate the Polish nation (again) but this time to the last person but still who would trust Stalin, massive prick that he was
Also, going back 50 years: allowing Franz Joseph to go full-out Neoabsolutism after the 1848 revolution
There was a referendum and all that
What definitely was our fault was the whole situation leading up to the Anschluss
Austria was weak in 1938
Well, people tried to not allow him that
The thing is, the reactionaries had a bunch of battle-tested armies (bc of wars in Italy, Bohemia), with heavy artillery and some seasoned generals (Windischgrätz, Radetzky), the Ban Jellachic's marauding Croat troops, and the support of most of the Slavic lands *and* the support of Russia (which was a secret tool that would help them later
in slaughtering the Hungarian revolutionaries)
The revolutionaries had Vienna
With the dead Minister of War hanging from a lantern post
And with some rifles
And a few cannons
And newspapers
Looots of newspapers
What I'm trying to say is, they didn't stand a chance
Basically, yes, but it was a bit more complicated
Comparing it with the Crimea referendum is not really appropriate
Illegal Nazis (the Nazi party had been illegal under the Austro-fascist regime) had already infiltrated the Austrian government
Then one day before the "Einmarsch" happend, the Nazis, Arthur Seyß-Inquart to be precise, completely took over the government
On the 12th of March 1938 Wehrmacht and German police took control of Austria, with people cheering them on in the streets
On the 13th of March, Nazi-Chancellor Seyß-Inquart officially signed the "Anschluss"-law
This was possible so fast and easily, because as chancellor he had a too high amount of competences, due to the preceding Austro-fascist regime
Pogromes ensued: Jews were harrassed, shops and synagogues burned down
This happened **without** the official directive of the Nazi party, Austrians (Nazis, Anti-semites, thugs, regular people) did that all by themselves
The governement in Berlin had to send out a directive to their party officials in Vienna, to chill the fuck down and control the situation
However, the Nazi-leadership also got inpired by those riots, they were a main inspiration for the "Kristallnacht" in November later that year
In order to make all of this look a bit more democratic on the international stage, the Nazis organized a [referendum] in April 1938
The new German citizens in the lands of former Austria were supposed to answer [this double-question about the "Anschluss" and about Hitler as the leader] (observe the size of the two circles tho)
Jews, "mixed" people, and political prisoners were not allowed to vote (=8% of the electorate) 99% voted with "Yes". There was also a parallel referendum about the Anschluss in "Old Germany", the result was the same
You can imagine how "democratically" that whole referendum went down
With SA-thugs waiting in the polling stations and people filling out the form in front of the officials in order to disperse suspicions of being "against the system" and stuff like that
In reality it is estimated that "only" about 60-80% of Austrians probably were in favor of Anschluss at that time, while probably around 30% where actual supporters of the NSDAP
But we can't be too sure about those figures
> in Germany we learn that we forced it onto you through pressure from our armed forces but I guess that's just half the story
"Opfermythos" nennt man das bei uns und war bis zur [Waldheimaffäre] in den 80ern die gängige Meinung in der Mehrheitsgesellschaft in Österreich
Da hat sich seither aber sehr viel geändert und getan
Heute wissen die meisten Österreicher, dass nicht "die bösen Deutschen" die Täter waren und "wir" die Opfer, sondern dass "wir" Teil der "bösen Deutschen" waren, und vielfach Österreicher in führenden Positionen im NS-Regime bzw
in der Durchführung des Holocaust tätig waren
Und dass der Anschluss nunmal keineswegs eine feindliche Übernahme war, sondern für die meisten Österreicher ein Freudenereignis
"Endlich ist der Führer da
Jetzt wird alles besser" hieß es damals
Es ist in den Jahrgängen 1938/39 auch ein deutlicher "Spike" in den Geburtenstatistiken zu verzeichnen, weil wenn sich die Leute freuen, dann budern sie auch mehr
Temperature isn't a good indicator on that
5 degrees can be warm with the right amount of humidity and no wind
5 degrees can also be freezing with a bad amount of humidity and much wind
There are days I can comfortably walk around the city at -5°C in my thin wintercoat and then there are days were I am freezing my balls off at +5°C in the same coat
Fuck this shit, I ain't leaving the bed: -20 downwards
Cold: 3 to -19
Chilly: 4 to 14
Nice: 15 to 20
Warm: 21 to 25
Hot: 26 to 39
The Apocalypse is nigh, may the devil have mercy on our soul: 40+
Cold: below 5
Chilly: 5 to 15
Nice: 15 to 25
Warm: 25 to 30
Hot: above 30
But in Austria it also heavily depends on what height you're on, 0° feel a lot colder at 2500m than at 250m.
Cold -10
Chilly  0
Nice 15
Warm 25
Hot 28
Tyrolean area
Cold: -20C - -5 C
Chilly: -5C - 10 C
Nice: 10-20 C
Warm: 20C - 30C
Hot: 30C+
so, 27c to 30c is "why can't I spend the whole day in the kiddie pool while you kill me"?
I think it also matters at what height you are
0°C at 2500m feels like - 5°C at 250m
Is snow en la Concha that common
I thought it's more of exception there
Like sunshine
or anything else that's not rain
It's ok, we know you Danes aren't so good with numbers
I'm thinking alcohol
Lots of it
48° ... close enough ... it's fine, really
You get used to it
Sundown today is at 16:03 google tells me
Where the name comes from
There's theories, but ultimately, no one knows
Same with the flag, but people chose their favourite myth in that regard
That time when Austria became an Archduchy, something never heard or seen before
But the Emperor thought it was a good idea to make his hereditary titel on par with the Arch Bishops and the Imperial electors, so he forged a bunch of documents providing him with many new privileges and consolidating several he already had
So from then on we had Arch Dukes because normal Duke wasn't enough
Took them another few centuries before they dropped the ducal facade and just declared Austria an Empire by itself so they could keep that title too
The name Österreich (German word for Austria for those who don't know) came from "Ostarrichi" and was first mentioned like a millennium ago
It doesn't literally mean "Eastern realm" ("Ostreich") in modern German nor in the language that was spoken at the time afaik, but that's the mainstream theory of what the name most likely means
However, no one knows who came up with the name, how long the region was called that, if it really means eastern realm and if so, what "eastern" relates to here
Is it the eastern part of Bavaria (the settlement area of the [Baiuvarii] tribe) or the eastern part of the [Frankish Empire] which existed before and/or roughly around the time Austria was first mentioned by name, or was it something else entirely
It connects us to Turkey
Both our flags are drenched in Turkish blood
The HRE didn't yet exist at the time
But yeah, most likely we were just called the eastern realm of east Francia
As far as I know Ostmark was only used by the nazis as an attempt to weaken the Austrian national identity
So Ostmark was really only used officially from 1938 to 1945 and maybe inofficially a short time around that window
Almost any bit of Italian got me a smile in Italy
While I am probably still capable of ordering ball bearings with a business letter, my spoken Italian unfortunatly rusted over time to the point where I can order a bistecca at a restaurant
Similarly some words of Germanic origin are very obvious for German natives while they may seem impressive for English natives
Like saying whom instead of who, which is just like German "wem". So for me it's the most obvious thing in the world but Anglos tend to be quite impressed by it
I remember when I was at a restaurant in Napoli and I wanted to order the bill but I didn't quite remember how to say it in Italian ("Il conto per favore")
So, I just said "l'addizione per favore", which is just the French "l'addition s'il vous plaît" translated into Italian only that it doesn't make much sense in this situation
They instantly broke out in laughter but they absolutely loved it
Very funny situation
[I like this one]
I‘m a huge fan of Juventus‘ redesigned logo
It‘s simplicity in a pure form
Old fans might disagree,though
[Logo]
I like [the badge of the team I support] because it's so simple
No fancy Coat of Arms or weird font, just the name, the colors, and a piece of nostalgia
Yes
That bat is awesome
They played a friendly against my Team  [Skn St
Pölten] in 2018, and I liked their badge because of the reference to Today I Learned :)
At first I read country and thought of something like Hubert von Goisern's [Heast as net]
For Vienna I can't think of anything atmospheric off the top of my head, but in general probably some 80's Austropop or Falco
I personally like [Granada's cover of Billy Joel's Vienna] albeit not a great fit for video game background music
Schnitzel
Cake and Christmas cookies
The precision in determining opening dates for new airports
*ducks*
I have to agree
Love British humour
It's actually very similar to Austrian humour
If somebody is offended by a joke, let them be offended though
And some Sachertorte
That's Austrian (Styrian) though
You should seriously consider to sell the DB to ÖBB
That's the airport that can be reached in precisely no time from the city
Just let the government run religious institutions and look at how stale and backwards it will become
That's the reason why there aren't that many religious people in Europe
Officially most people are catholic in Austria and they might even claim to be religious but most just believe in a god but not the christian god
If people ask me if I am religious and my answer is no, they immediatly want me to clarify if I just don't believe in the church or generally in no god
Fewer and fewer actually believe in the religion portrayed by churches and those who are left will die with their beliefs, no matter what the church is doing
A mild version would be an improvement

In my youth, I used to ride my bicycle right past [Mozart's birthplace] every day on my way to school but I've never actually been inside
I live somewhat close to Hallstatt but up until last year it was always so overrun that I never really bothered to go there
I went there twice last year with friends
Was quite pretty actually
I live near the KZ Mauthausen and wanted to go there, but because of Corona I didn't get the chance
I have been living for more than 12 years in Vienna now and I have never been to Schönbrunn
I lived in london for a few months
A visit was quite obligatory
As a regular tourist its horrible
You cant go there by bus, and the fees are exorbitant
Fortunately with a car you can just stop by
Sneaking in wasn‘t too hard as well
But i dont recommend to pay 50gbp for this
Kohlmarkt and Freyung are just streets, you've not been there
Never been at Naschmarkt
Hinterbrühl isn't in Vienna, neither is Burg Liechtenstein
All in all you could do with a bit more culture in your life
Last summer the Bundescard, which gets you into a fair few of these places, was only €20
It was totally worth it
I'm not even viennese and I've been to a lot of those places
Du bist ja no jung ;)
Ehhhhh bester Stand Josefstädter U-Bahnstation
I thought too but it was in Google's Vienna sightseeing list so I put it in anyway
Yup, those streets never were on my way tho
I guess they will sooner or later
I also thought that I might have been to some on the list but I can't remember
That's kind of the point
If you live in Vienna you don't have a Wienwoche :P
Kommt drauf an aus welcher Sicht :)
Where to go during quarantine
But before
I barely went outside
I have a problem
Never heard of it
But I have to say that I dislike clubs/bars
So what do you guys do
Geh wäh, den find ich gar net gut dort
When you're living here you miss some sights many want to visit
It's not that I don't like to go there
It's just that you have a live here and easily forget that you actually could visit those places
Tho you get to visit mist of them sooner or later (in school, excursions, work, etc
No, I meant instead of Wienwoche
What excursions did your school do
Ja, genau, so ein kleines Standl das tut als obs zum (sehr superen) Lokal daneben ghören würde
Tuts aber net
I guess just the typical ones
Going up the Stephens Cathedral, visiting some museums (Albertina, Mumok, Naturhistorisches Museum, Kunsthistorisches Museum), visiting Schloss Schönbrunn (plus it's park), going through the city center (first district) in general, some history lessons outside, etc
Geb ich dir recht :)
Ich mag den vom Kebabhaus in der Faulmanngasse recht gern
Allerdings mag ich nur Lamm-Döner, da wird die Auswahl immer enger ...
We just start from 21
The word „einundzwanzig“ (and „zweiundzwanzig“ (22), „dreiundzwanzig“ (23) and so on) perfectly fits in a second if spoken properly/not too fast
I guess the Montan-University with it's specialisation in a bit niche but demanded fields like Tunnel engineering, Mining and Petrochemistry is a good candidate
In STEM, aka one of the best paid job fields and also one where most people will get a degree in, telematics is really looked up to
Engineering/STEM jobs overall tho
I almost exclusively know engineers
Most of them actively seek out higher education and some get a degree
There are many universities that teach any kind of engineering too, as far as I know
(Have to add: I‘m an electrical engineer currently in higher education
I don‘t have much information about degrees in any other kind of engineering other than the basics
Teachers too
Professors specifically since you have to get a bunch of degrees to become a professor
And teacher because nobody wants to deal with some of these disrespectful pre-pubescent teens
All STEM fields
Especially Chemical Engineering
We are very good with that but it is a super hard field and , at my university, only about 20 people a year finish the BSc, most go on for a MSc and the Phd
It is very difficult to learn but you get paid a lot
Not me but a friend who almost never travels out of the country: Smoking in restaurants and bars
For a while now we've been one of the last countries in central and western Europe that allow it
He was really surprised other countries banned it many years ago
That will change soon however, from November on it will be banned here too
I think it kind of sucks but I suppose it's better that way in the long tern
also Radler
but you're fine if you go to a somewhat typical german tourist destination
just been to lago di garda and got greeted with apfelschorle
We have that too
At least both my grandparents
Most people don't do it at home anymore
But if you are getting lunch in any restaurant there is always a soup included
In autumn you will see cars parked left and right on rural streets
All from city people who drive into the forests and go mushroom picking
Even fucking Italians come here and pick our mushrooms
We even introduced border controls for mushrooms, because the Italians are picking tons and selling it in Italy
Austrian chiming in its a shame that Tracht seems to go away except for those few weeks where Oktober fest is happening in munich and the smaller one here in Vienna
In Austria it's "Apfelsaft gespritzt" --> long live Austria-Hungary ;)
We do
Until next week
The problem is still that the workers have to work in smoking environments
Workers protection is strong here
One of the things the country is built on
Vienna is different though
You can’t compare Vienna to the countryside
Here in Tyrol, our Tracht is very common and seen on feast days, weddings, birthdays, ...
Every valley/region has its own typical Tracht
We‘ve also got the [Tiroler Schützen] and every village has its own marching band
They‘re marching through the villages on feast days ([procession] weddings, birthdays, funerals (of a member)
Sometimes the Schützen wake me up on sunday mornings, since they shoot with blanks to salute
Okay yea sorry for the oversimplification, I'm from lower Austria so I tend to wear Tracht on those days you mentioned as well, but tbh I only see my generation putting on a Dirndl when it comes to these October fest events, where you're more attention-grabbing if you don't wear Tracht
What I meant was when given the choice between Dirndl and a normal dress for a wedding most women I know (20 to 25yrs) don't even think a Dirndl would be appropriate
Probably Turkey: they colonized large parts of Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia and ran a huge slave trade but nobody seems to care
Brits were the worst, but Belgium is up there
Related to that: [A father stares at the hand and foot of his five-year-old daughter, severed as a punishment for having harvested too little rubber

No offense, but how are we any more responsible for WW2 than the Germans
And why didn't we exist
Well, but the whole opium thing and the amount of people who starved in India adds up kinda
Except we don't act as if we were innocent
Our attrocities in WW2 and the reasons leading to the rise of National Socialism are the biggest topics in history class for instance
Which kept the Swedes from being invaded and getting their cities turned to rubble themselves
For them cooperation was the only reasonable choice
Austrias Gold helped Hitler, he needed it to continue with his plans, wasnt just a strategic question
The one with the little moustache was born in Austria but lost his citizenship when he joined the German army
Technically when he rose to power he wasn't legally Austrian
He didn't acknowledge the Austrian state nor it's institutions
But yes many Austrians were fanatic Nazis
And how we treated the Balkans and Italy 100 years before wasn't quite too nice either
Do you consider communist elections in Czechoslovakia also free and fair
It's not like they were open elections and soldiers with guns weren’t posted in front of the election buildings
Well we are a federation of nine countries, so each one is somewhat autonomous
AFAIK other places like switzerland give their local countries even more rights than us but still
There are areas of Austria (mostly along the sothern/southeastern border) that have special provisions like bilingual schools and kindergartens and signs for the Slovenian, Hungarian and Croat minorities
But there are no autonomous administrative regions as there are no majority minority areas
The Austrian states are not really autonomous
That's why there's a "somewhat". That's the point of a federation - some autonomy, some central government
Austria would be thicc again :)
edit: No wait
if we didn't regain the old lands we would be even smaller than now D:
Napoleon (I don't know the how manyth) would probably invade Vienna every Monday morning and leave again by late afternoon
"glad" to hear Austria is not the only one doing that
Really appreciated the relatively consistent measures that Sweden had, spent the first half of the pandemic (so far) there
Are apricot (or other fruit) dumplings a thing outside of Austria
So, here in Austria we got dumplings made from either potato or [topfen] dough filled with whole apricots ([Marillenknödel] They always come with "Brösel" (a breadcrumb and sugar mixture roasted in - ideally - clarified butter), which are nearly as important as the dumpling itself, and plenty of powder sugar
These are considered a great classic of Austrian/Viennese cuisine
There is also other fruits that can be used, like plums or strawberries, but these are not as "classic".
However I don't think I ever heard of similar dishes elsewhere, especially not that they would be held in nearly such high regard
So: are fruit filled dumplings "a thing" elsewhere
Do you also have "Brösel" with them or some other side
Yeah we have a lot of shared (cooking) history, that's for sure \^\^
But how does it work with blueberries, these dumplings must be tiny
> Aprikosen
don't even get me started on your German food terms ... \*cringes* ;)
Maybe they have them in eastern Galicia
Seems to be a pretty widespread thing in both Poland and former Austria-Hungarian territories
cinnamon ... ginger ... currants ... sounds nice
Somehow reminds me of Kletznbrot ("bread" with spices and dried fruits mixed in), though they sound softer (Kletznbrot can be quite hard)
> My first thought; what does something like this even look like
See link in op
> Second thought; are apricots grown in Austria
Yep, along the danube, especially in the Wachau
[Wachauer Marille] is actually a protected geographical indication
Only difference: in Germany they put mushroom sauce over top ;)
Get potato dough package from store, take core out of apricots (and if you are a grandma replace with a cube of sugar for that extra sweetness kick), make potato dough as per packaging and wrap apricots in it, boil as per packaging
Crumbs: get some butter into a pan, throw in some breadcrums and sugar (I'd say about 2-3:1 ratio should be _plenty_ sweet), roast until they are nice and golden brown
It's really not hard
Unless you want to make the dough yourself (though that's mainly because I got zero idea about it)
But the dough is made from potatoes
With the similarity to the German word "Knödel" or in Austrian dialect even "Knedl" I would be shocked if they were much different
I have actually seen them as "Marillenknödel" on the manu in Saxony, close to the Czech border
Only because by pure coincidence the English picked up the same word stem ;)
You've been banned from /r/aeiou
Außerdem, Quark vergessen (Topfen haßt des
Baked
Yeah if you'd boil the dough I can imagine it getting nice and soft
8 pc Apricots
800 	g  Potatoes (the kind you would use for making mashed potatoes)
100 	g All purpose flour
80 	g Semolina
1 pc	Egg yol
1 	pinch salt
60 	g 	Butter
200 	g 	Breadcrumbs
120 	g 	Butter (für the breadcrumbs)
If you can't get Semolina, in a pinch probably even corn meal or polenta will do
It's corn, not wheat, but I think it should still work
1) Wash and throughly dry the apricots
2) Boil the potatoes until soft and mash them
3) Add semolina, yolk, melted butter, flour and salt and mix throughly until a soft, smooth dough forms
This is similar to a Gnocchi dough
4) Form dough into a roll and cut off discs
Put Apricot in the middle of the disk and form dough into a ball around it
You have to go with your gut here, the size of the roll depends on the size of your apricots
You are looking at an even coating of dough, maybe half to a centimeter thick
This is the kind of thing grandmothers fight about, it depends on what you want your dough/apricot ratio to be
5) Melt the other butter in a pan and roast the bread crumbs until golden brown
Stir constantly, they burn very easily
I would recommend that you also add a good amount of sugar to the breadcrumbs
As you can see in the recipe, there's no sugar in the dough and you can't always depend on the sweetness of the apricots
6) Bring a large pot with lightly salted water to a simmer and put the dumplings in there for about 10 minutes
7) Fish them out, let them dry for a bit, then put into the pan with the bread crumbs and coat thoroughly
Eat while still hot but not too hot because the apricots will burn the roof of your mouth off
Oh the pain ... here you can get [potato dough powder] in any supermarket where you just add water
It's not the greatest but a whole lot less work ;)
Actually if you got to make dough on your own anyhow, you should definitely make the curd based dough from /u/little_bohemian's recipe (from the 1st link)
It's way more fluffy and nice, but always has to be handmade (which is the reason why it's rarer, I guess)
> Italian - albicocca
Ironically because Marille actually comes from italian armellino
Dammit, this guy might be right
Not for speaking Hochdeutsch, for speaking the germany-version of Hochdeutsch
What infuriates us the most is that you assume that our nice austrian Hochdeutsch- expressions like Topfen or Marille might be just dialect words
Go tell an english person that "autumn" and "trousers" are provicial dialect words
No problem
Oh, and you can remove the pit of the apricots by poking them from the top with e.g. the handle of a wooden spoon or something or just making a slit on one side (though the larger the opening, the more juice will escape)
You don't have to, it's fine to leave them in, but you can
One of my grandmothers used to replace the pit with a bit of marzipan
You do you :)
Probably a Döner, 2nd choice would be some Asia noodles, 3rd choice McDonald's
Yup same here
Not leaving before they throw me out
Second this
The good thing about eating McDonalds while being completely shitfaced: When you inevitably throw it up again, it still tastes exactly the way it did when you ate it
We might have a Döner or Pizza-slice as well but if you feel real Austrian you'll want to get a [Käsekrainer]
You guys have gay spars
I rather have myself a hot Burenheidl, at my local neighbourhood Hurenbeidl
And have another beer with it
A Krainer is a sausage from Krain, i.e. Slovenia
"Käsekrainer" is the Austrian variation where you infuse the Krainer with cheese
In 2012 Austria and Slovenia even had a whole court battle over the naming rights
My guess: Because the neighbours want to sleep
And the owners of the garden don't want to constantly pay police fines for noise disturbances
I hope someone will google that :D
its not cultural nuances between northern and southern germany, those are the nuances between germany and austria (and austrian influeced germany aka bavaria)
It's not, as it is extremly Austrian
The Käsekrainer was invented in Upper Austria in the 1960s/1970s. But the base sausage Krainer (i.e. without the cheese) is traditionally Slovenian (Krain = Slovenia)
[That one is for you only]
Tatsächlich
Das ist schön (und amüsant) zu hören, aber wenn man es sich recht überlegt auch nicht allzu überraschend
Es war ja doch nur eine Frage der Zeit, bis die zahlreichen deutschen NC-Flüchtlinge bei ihrer unweigerlichen Rückkehr in die Bundesrepublik unsere dem jahrhundertelang vorherrschenden altösterreichsichem Vielvölkergemisch entsprungenen kulinarischen Schätze in den hohen Norden mitbringen
Wohl bekomms
I've always wondered why americans call them steins
Where did you get that word from
Gösser Radler ist mittlerweile fast Standard im Hamburger späti
Da wäre es wirklich spannend, ob das von den nc-flüchtling-heimkehrern mitgebracht wurde, oder mehr das "exotisch- importiert" und urlaubsgefühl dazu beigetragen hat
(abgesehen davon, dass der/das Radler einfach gut ist)
Vll ein bissl was von beidem
Probably [St
Stephen's Cathedral]
or [Schönbrunn Palace] both in Vienna
The first building that came to my mind was the [Hofburg] in Vienna or the [Museum of Fine Arts]
But to be fairly honest right now, I barely know foreigners that know anything about Austria, so finding a building people know is really difficult for me rn
Edit: Also saw somebody else talk about Schönbrunn and St Stephens Cathedral and gotta agree with them too
Just the view from a foreigner (who never saw Star Wars): La Sagrada Familia is the only one I _didn‘t_ have to google, because I knew right away, but the other two are pretty iconic too (I didn‘t know the name but I they did look very familiar)
I always thought the Poles hate that building because it remembers them on the soviet time
From a foreigner's perspective I'd say that the first thing that comes to mind thinking of the Netherlands would be giant windmills surrounded by tulip fields
So maybe the windmills at Kinderdijk or even De Gooyer could do
Really cool but it's the first time I've seen/heard of it
It stands at the very center of the city
For Viennese and probably most people from the eastern part of Austria it is the defacto symbol of the city
The other sights are important, but the church has a special place
Not only due to beeing the central point to which most larger streets lead to  in the inner city and where the Emperors are burried, but due to it beeing a symbol of rebuilding the country after WW2
Apart from that it is also associated with some of the few acts of Austrian resistance against the Nazi regime
> where the Emperors are burried
Only the Emperors' intestines are buried there
The Emperors' bodies are buried in the Kaisergruft in the Kapuzinerkloster at Neuer Markt
Their hearts are in the Augustiner Church
Don't forget about [St Mary's Basilica] in Krakow
Both the exterior and [the interior are mind-blowing] and I believe it will be the first thing to come to mind for anybody who's visited Poland
Palace of Culture and Science is also iconic and arguably the most popular, but just like many other landmarks in Poland it reminds of sad times in the Polish history and I just wish the rest of the Europe saw more beauty in this country, as it surely deserves it
Disclaimer: I'm not a bike commuter (yet)
This is highly different
Here in Vienna older (steel) road bikes seem to be a bit popular
A few years ago there was a hype about fixies and single speeds
I also know of people who commute with their 2000 € carbon road bike and carry it up into the office
Also a relative of mine lives on the countryside and rides 30km with his E-Bike (he is nearly 60) to work if it isn't raining
Most important feature might be a bell and lights if you also ride in winter
Also your bike should be conform to road safety regulations because police is checking a lot of bikers in Vienna
I don't know why one should veer into another lane
There are bike courses in ground school (I don't know if every ground school does this) and you can get bike driver license (which allows you to ride your bike alone before the age of 12 if I correctly remember)
I live in Vienna, where a lot of people commute with bikes and/or public transport instead of cars
My bike's a 26" mountainbike
I like the flexibility, and the suspension fork :)
> How do you learn to ride in traffic without veering into another lane
Serious question: Why on earth would you
Riding a bike in a straight line is really not hard
I would say city bikes are very popular, especially among students who can't afford road bikes (das sind Rennräder oder
And if you have to leave them outside then usually those bikes are rather cheap ones or old ones, because they occasionally get stolen
I think one of the most important equipment is a helmet
Riding a bike in heavy traffic is dangerous
Not every city has decent bike paths
I think it is important to always expect other people to not see you and especially don't count on them stopping for you even if you are in the right
It's just a matter of practice I guess
I couldn't imagine living in the city without a bicycle
It’s becoming a problem in the alps
Especially accident wise as those guys thing that forrest roads are super easy to navigate and then are surprised that things like cattle grids and drains are not 100% bike friendly
And I am not even speaking of the real downhill trails
All of them except Nazi and Allied occupation I guess
9th-13th century: HRE Prince
13th century-1918: Great power of Europe
1918-present: Small European country
same
Plus the 10 years of occupation by the Allied Forces after WWII ending in 1955
Yes "we" (i.e. our grand and great-grand parents) were, but "Austria" didn't exist during that time i.e. it wasn't sovereign
I can tell you, he definitely didn't want to play the victim card here
It's not like I was disappointed, but I'm not a big fan of Paris
I was actually pretty disappointed by Paris
It's smelly, the traffic is whack and it's just not as special as it's always portrayed
I guess you should've ventured out of the Inner City a bit then
2004 and 2018
Not a bad place per se, but I didn't find it all too appealing/interesting
It's never warm in England tough
It's sometimes jokingly referred to as 'ottacrime'
But all jokes aside - otk is alright
to give a bit of a different answer than most, I think it's totally fine
as long as you act a bit apologetic about it, or at least marginally self-aware that what you're asking for is probably not in the best interest for the bar owner (you trying to spend little money instead of a lot)
doesn't mean they won't be happy for the business they get with you, doesn't mean that you have to be all I'm really very sorry or not dare to ask for it at all
but in my experience NA Anglos often try to be friendly by being open and jovial, and while that alone can sometimes be good or a bit much depending on person and situation, having it combined here with a situation where it would probably be better to act a bit
subdued, it can probably happen that you'll be scoffed at, for having the gall to ask while acting all proud of it at the same time as well
this goes in general by the way: if you have to ask, don't be all naive and friendly about it, instead act like you're sorry for having to ask
the reactions you get will be much better
I can only guess as to why, but suspect it's because we culturally put the responsibility of reading a situation correctly/getting social cues/just generally knowing stuff more on the learner, and not as much on the teacher
- A little bit of Mesopotamian cultures
- a little bit of Egypt
- *a lot* about Greeks (in all their shapes and forms), Romans and Celts (the ones that lived here of course, not the island Celts)
- a bit about Phoenicians/Carthago
- quite a bit about the tribal migration period in the late Antiquity/early Middle Age period and its various protagonist peoples/tribes (Hunns, Goths, Vandals, Langobards, Franks, Alemans etc
etc
- in religion class: ancient desert peoples that are featured in the Old Testament
That's too long to remember, we started history lessons with Schliemann and his discoveries about Troy and Mycenaean Greece
I'm pretty Sure the Curriculum changed since I've went to school, I was pretty sad that we learned so little about the celts, a bit about Hallstatt culture
[The aqueduct
German: H like the first to letters in 'hard' together
We say it like, sorry for the weird example, the guy in the HA
GAY
meme
Except not this short, it‘s more like hhaa, so you can really hear that it’s a h. That‘s for the alphabet, if it‘s in a word like idk Höhle [cave] then the a behind is unheard
Sounds kind of like _huh
_ Sometimes it‘s also a silent letter
E.g. word Höhle [cave] again, the first H is pronounced, the second is silent
And in the alphabet A and H aren‘t really similarly, maybe a lil bit, and in words not at all
Edit: Pretty mich pronounced like hurry or hide, I just read the comments below and found this example :‘D and for A, it‘s pronounced like the A in „darn it
Chechnya (if you count that) and Russia (not because of the people but the because of the politics)
Belarus, Russia, Azerbaijan & Turkey
Never say never
So no, there's not country I'd *never* consider visiting
Some more likely than others, but hey if you give me a plane ticket and a week off
I'll go anywhere
The only countries I'd exclude are some for safety reasons, traveling is great but you don't have to be stupid about it
But I'm happy that none of those are in Europe
Ramsan Kadyrov and his stance on LGTBQ people is enough of a reason not to go
Not saying its a bad place overall but the leadership is atrocious and I won't support a government like that
That's why I said (if you count that)
He doesn't know what he's missing, your country is grand
>  the Greek government
I'm confused
The southern Cypriot government, or the Greek governemnt of the country Greece
Cyprus isn't part of Schengen though
Okay, I understand
Djibouti and Timbuktu are used for that in (Austrian) German
My grandma always refers to Gigritzpatschen, an imaginative village in the middle of nowhere
Gigritz evidently mimics the sound a crow makes
Also, Hintertupfingen (behind-tupfing,a fantasy word) in Germany and Austria
Also “Schasklappersdorf”
Which
would be “fart-rattle-village”, I guess
Wait, "Dripsdrü" isn't a word my mum invented
Haven't heard that one before tbh
Really
I was surprised no one had mentioned it, because it’s so common around my family and group of friends
Maybe a Viennese thing
Idk
>Maybe a Viennese thing
While I'm not born and raised Viennese I've never lived further than 30km from the city (and currently live in Vienna) ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
A young American+British couple asked me whether there are mountains in Austria
Granted, they where hitchhiking in the Danube valley but you could even see the first alpine mountains from there
I have endless amounts of fun encounters with (mostly) Americans
Probably because they are the most likely to approach you
One time this elderly lady with a heavy texan drawl asked me where the Fortress Hohensalzburg is
I said “well, let me think“ and started staring at thw huge castle looming on a mountain above the city
When they realized what I was getting at her husband laughed
I think she was less amused
Another time an american family from Minnesota asked if they could share a table at a beergarden
We got into a conversation and the father of the group could not get over the fact that my friend lived in an apartement in the 800 year old housr next to the beergarden
He apparently believed those were all just kept for decoration
two girls (late teens) from the us were completely astonished, we have fridges in austria (i do not know what they thought we use - ice
nothing
) but they were so amazed we have fridges (and not only for shops or so, but in our houses
Two American ladies were waiting in line in front of me to get a Döner/Kebap at a kebap stand
When the kebap man told them that they only could pay with cash they angrily turned around and asked me where to get money because "in this fucking country you can't pay anything without cash".
I just entered "ATM" in Google Maps on their phone and they were amazed by that
In the same night a French girl I talked to said that she can't wait to get home again because she misses good tasting food
That hurt a little bit to be honest
There are a lot of mostly American tourists who like greeting/thanking/etc
in the language of the country theyre visiting
Like "Gooten Tawg, Id like to buy these souvenirs, Danke, Awf Viderrzeyn
The amount of tourists that get the language wrong though is quite weird
I was often greeted in French and Italian
*vaguely gestures at everywhere*
That doesn't suprise me, there are people who are super dissapointed when they come to Austria and see we actually have cars, not horse carriages, like they saw in the movies
Time for a revolution
Do you have those in your country
Our english teacher once told us when she visited  the U.S (20years ago) they wouldn't believe her we had washing machines over here
It just baffles me
well in Vienna it's not called Eiskasten for no reason
best reaction would probably be to start explaining to them how it works, pretending to think that they don't have any one home, considering they're so excited about it
I mean, we often tell Americans that they should at least learn hello/please/thanks in the local language
So you can't blame them for that
My buddy invited him to see the flat
While the guy was ecstatic and *would not stop gushing about how cool it was*, his daughter and son were mortified
Good times
Preach it, pastaboi
As somebody who works in tourism its nothing but annoying if somebody greets you in your language but doesnt speak it
Its our only hint which language this person understands so naturally if somebody says Guten Tag to me I start talking in German - only to realize a minute later that this person can only say these two words
If I could change one thing about tourists it would be that they stop doing that
That theres way less spontanious singing and dancing going on that expected just adds to the dissapointment
Still haven't seen it, and don't intend to ever do

Local language, no
A very commonly understood foreignlanguage, yes, but not a local language at all
Noted and same
Well, the French are sure something else
Usually a French talking collegue takes over
Otherwise I have below the counter the standard sentences written in French (and Italian)
97% of the time
I have a some coworkers who need switch to English for technical topics because they're immigrants and aren't as fit with our language, otherwise I very rarely speak another language
Edit: I'd also like to nominate this as "the weirdest or funniest thing a foreigner said".
Americans really know little about foreign countries/cultures

But only because I make it a point to regularly exit my filter bubble and go looking for different news outlets

Although if you hadn't mentioned it I would probably have forgotten about it
It only got my attention because it was only a few months after the dam break and I have been paying more attention to south America since the whole Venezuela issue got more serious
Nope, not in Austria
The law is very lax
It basically says "you have to use appropriate force" which is defined by
Nothing
Completely up to the courts to decide if something was self defense with appropriate force
But generally they will likely rule in favor of the defendant if it was defense against bodily harm
Defense of property, not always
It says that use of force is not appropriate when there is "only small damage", so you can't shoot someone who stole a few euros from you
You have a right to self defense and defending others but there is also "Excessive Self Defense" when you go beyond what is imediatly necessary to mitigate the danger to yourself or others
In the end it boils down to a case by case decission by a judge
There have been cases of a trespasser beeing shot that were found to be within the law and others of a broken nose to be beyond the right of self defense
Also, in Austria every unblemished adult person can own guns for self defence
Thats unheard of, in most European countries
It's interesting to look at cases where people defended themselves
There was a case where a guy shot and killed an intruder through a closed door
It was ruled to be appropiate self defence, because the defendant announced that he was armed and the intruder still tried to open the door
On the other hand, if you are not at home and get attacked, and you defend yourself with a knife, it's extremely unlikely that it will be declared self-defense
>I just don't fear burglars because they're after my stuff only and that's a nuisance, not a danger
Nobody should fear basic burglars, but home invasions are becoming more frequent in Europe too
> It was response to paneuropean law banning extended ammunition clips and other stuff, that has no reason to be owned by civilians
The European law banned normal sized magazines
Not "extended" ones
They claimed it was to fight islamic terrorism, but there hasn't been a single terrorist attack in Europe performed with a magazine or gun that would have been effected by that law
>which is why almost all armies reserve them for specialist units, and use semi automatic rifles with reduced propellant, called "assault rifles".
Which armies are you talking about
Almost all armies issue "select fire" rifles to general infanterists
Select fire means, you can switch between full-auto and semi-auto
Militaries generally don't use reduced propellant either
NATO loads are pretty high compared to most civilian loads
NATO militaries use the 5,56x45mm cartridge which is a "intermediate cartridge".
Switzerland, Austria and Czechia have gun culture and I don't think anything is wrong with that
But in my opinion, American gun culture has become very toxic
Yeah
Austrian and Czech gun laws are pretty liberal
I don't know any EU countries besides them that allow self defense for every citizen
I'd say theft and robbery usually
But sexual assault, murder and kidnapping are also in the realm of possibility
When the occupants are inside, the invaders can force them to tell where the valuables are or make them open the safes
I am not saying it's a common occurance, just that the rates are increasing
Still not anywhere close to American levels
The law came into effect very recently
No islamic terrorist used legal weapons, neither before or after the magazine ban
Not if there has never been that kind of attack before the law was passed, which is what I understood the comment to mean
>We kinda do, yet also don't. Here you are allowed to use a gun to defend yourself, but I don't think it's allowed to carry guns
What I meant is that, self defense is a viable reason to get a gun (for the general population)
The law here specifically says, that every unblemished adult citizen shall be issues a license for 2 guns for self defense, if they apply for one
Carrying is another license though
>So in essence if you carry an illegal firearm and use it to kill someone in self defence, you will be fined for the offence of carrying an illegal firearm, but you won't be punishment for (reasonable) use of said firearm
Yeah, thats how it works here as well
In Austria for example there hasn’t been a general magazine limit before the EU wide ban
And there has never been a crime or attack comitted with a legal magazine that has now been banned
For hunting the limit is 2+1 here
The EU ban was specifically targeted at islamist attacks, according to the lawmaker
I don't think its working and it is unnecessary
They are not going to reduce terrorist attacks or gun crime by banning magazines above a certain size
Neither terrorists nor criminals used those kind of weapons
They are not effected by the law at all
What the law accomplishes is harassment of legal gun owners, a huge strain on bureaucracy and legal confusion for all involved parties
The problem is, those magazines used to be completely free to buy  and sell
Now they became "illegal weapons" over night and suddenly you have to register every single one of them
Government agencies are overwhelmed with work, jurists and lawyers are not sure how to apply those EU laws and law abiding citizens might become criminals over night due to weird new law
And no additional security is gained
Our rural police was called Gendamerie as well until they were merged with our urban police (Polizei) in 2003 or so
They weren't a part of the military though
We had two different Polices before they were unified but none of them were Military Police
However one of them, the "Gendarmerie" Doubled as militia during the occupation time after WW2 until we were allowed again to found a "prober" Military, that showed also im the Name of the Ranks and the hirachy which was more Military like
We had a separation of police and Gendarmerie until the 2 decades ago
But the Gendarmerie was no paramilitary formation in contrast to France
Both forces were unified as police with much of the Gendarmeries tradition beeing integrated
Especially in the training of officers
In 2005 (just looked it up :))
Austria has a quite good one:
A "Grubenhund"(mine dog) is a letter to the editor written to troll newspapers into publishing nonsense
It comes from the word "Grubenhunt", which is a mine cart
It came about when an satirist got fed up by journalists writing incompetently about technical topics; he wrote to the "Neue Freie Presse" a letter which contained phrases like "variability of the pressure thickness" and "cosmic earthquakes".
A few years later an engineer picked up the idea and wrote them about an earthquake:
"I sat alone in the compressor room, when - it was exactly 10:27 - the 400 horsepowered compressor, which fed the electromotor for the steam-overheater, showed a noticeable voltage fluctuation
Totally unexplainable, on the other hand, was, that my mine dog, sleeping in the laboratory, showed signs of extreme nervousness, half an hour before
Later examples from other people included fireproof coal, square circles and the senator Duca Melbista-Berso-Thum(Du Kamel bist aber so dumm / You are a stupid camel, though)
In Austria, especially in Vienna, we call undertakers "Pompfüneberer". This is of course the butchered version of the french phrase "pompes funèbres", "great funerals" - the name one of the biggest funeral homes in Vienna around 1900
Medieval tales/epics are in general shared between the "Frankish" countries (France, Germany, Lowlands, Alps, and sometimes England, Italy, Spain)
Judging by the development over the recent years, nobody is learning even about things that happened a hundred years ago
Most historical events are glossed over, sadly, and WWII is spoken about for far too long (to the point where at least half of the students don't even care about the topic, because they feel that they are being lectured at for something that is out of their control)
I had a really great history teacher, and they spent a lot of time talking about Vienna between the bread wars and red Vienna, which was nice and really interesting, but my other history lessons often revolved around Rome, and things like this
In Austria, school starts when youre about 6 or 7 and is just mandatory until you're roughly 15 years old (9 school years) where about [1/3] start an apprenticeship and the rest continues with school until they are around 19 and then go to uni
So technically you could already work by 18
England has 11 years of compulsory education, ending at age ~16
There's then 2 years of specialising before starting university at ~18
University usually starts at 18 for women and 19 for men because of the mandatory military/civilian service
Yeah, as much as there's to critizise about our education system, we have apprenticeships pretty dialed
If i were to make a decision again (being 15 and knowing what i know now, about what kind of work i want to do) i think i'd take that route rather than the academic one
**Linz** -> The Celts first settled the place and called it *Lentia* = curve, because the Danube makes a big curve here
Then the Romans came and built a military castrum, took the Celtic name, and "latinized" it by just using a similar sounding Latin word instead, i.e. *lynx, lynces* (like the big cat)
That eventually turned in Lintz or Linz
**Vienna** (= german: Wien, Austrian dialect: Wean) is more complicated as there's two separate etymologies:
-> the first to settle here were also Celts
The name comes probably from Celtic *Vedunia* = "forest brook", and refers to the river Wien
Then it is believed that there might have been a Slavic version of this name for a while, because Slavs settled in most of modern Austria in the early Middle Ages, before German speaking Bavarian settlers arrived a few hundred years later
But the Slavic name is not known, because they didn't write a lot
Then we find the Old High German name *Wenia* in a Latin text from around the 9th century, which certainly derives from *Vedunia*. That eventually turned into *Wien* or *Wean*.
-> *Vindobona* was the name of the Roman castrum in very center of today's Vienna (right in the oldest part of the old town), but it has no known etymological links to *Wien* (or at least it's disputed)
It also derives from Celtic and means "white settlement" or "white soil" or "property of a man named Vindos", and probably originally referred to some kind of manor of a Celtic noble
*Vindobona* later changed as well, and eventually turned into *Viden/Widen/Vieden/Wieden*, which is still the Czech, Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian name for Vienna
The relation with the name of the 4th district of Vienna, *Wieden*, is disputed
*Vindobona* is still used today sometimes, e.g. in Latin texts
The University of Vienna is officially called *Alma Mater Rudolphina Vindobonensis*.
Neither of the etymologies have anything to do with wine, which is a common misconception
Fun fact: the opening scene of *Gladiator* is supposedly set close to Vindobona
Marc Aurel actually came here
From my birth town it's Bear's creek, but nobody is sure if it's named after literally a bear or an noble named Pero (which is old high German for bear)
Graz where I lived for a Long Time comes from Gradec, has slavic Origin and is the dimutiv of Castle, so it's little Castle
Salzburg - directly translated it means "Salt Castle", the name stems from the salt trading and manufacturing in the region
This took place in the time when the former roman city of Iuvavum was refounded (696 A. D.) as Salzburg around 200 years after the collapse of the roman empire
Kirchberg am Wechsel
Well first part translates to Churchhill cause there is literally a church on a hill
Second part means "at the Change" where the "Change" (Wechsel) is a mountain that is known for his quickly changing weather conditions
At least that's what my grandpa told me :)
As a life-long Wiener I learned a lot from your post, thank you
In my experience, people from Copenhagen do this
People from Jutland not so much
We say that "Katzen schnurren" (Cats purr), but we don't have a word or sound for the purring itself, as far as I'm aware of
It's the same in Austria
I actually don't even know which university has the best reputation for my studies
That's not really something people care about
Also the private universities have a reputation of buying yourself a degree when you can't make it into public university
Most studies are actually not restricted regarding the amount of students
If you want to study law or chemistry e.g. you just sign up
Only for medicine, psychology or Fachhochschulen (universities of applied sciences) you have to do an entrance exam
So I only know 2 private universities and they are for psychology and medicine
When looking for a master's I found out that we actually have a surprising amount of private universities for business studies
All of them are paid degree mills that finish with an MBA, but still, there's more than one would think
Almost every university (theoretically) has entry exams now, I had one to get into the University of Business and Economics
You usually have to sign up for the test in spring or so and it only takes place if there are enough people applying (didn't take place for law this year for example)
That cant be the reason,
We are Team Catholic since the release and we still have tons of folklore including the mentioned "Wasserman".
That cant be the reason, We are Team Catholic since the release and we still have tons of folklore including the mentioned "Wasserman".
they sitting on the rocky Islands, AFAIK they are often depicted with Eagle wings and claws
The most famous mentioning would be in Homers Odyssee
AFAIK mermaids have the same origin and they do basically the same, luring and seducing seaman to join them and then kill them
(also in 20th century paintings they are depicted as nude woman in the sea)
Any movie-plot that requires an in-country coast line
Anything involving road trips
Between high gas prices, short distances and crowded roads, they're not really a thing here, you either go by car for short distances, or you take the plane or train for longer ones (anything 3-400km+)
Connected to that, anything involving highway/freeway culture, specifically diners and mom-and-pop highway rest stops and quirky small-town sights like "biggest chicken statue of Texas". Our rest stops are all professionalised chains that serve fancy buffet style restaurant food at overly high prices (not much competition on the freeway), the equivalent to highway truck stops are probably the cafés adjacent to gas stations, but they're always sad smoky places and only good for coffee, a dry sandwich, or some greasy sausage or kebap
And even though there are local sights like some old castle or maybe a farmer's market, there's hardly any attractions with the sole purpose of attracting passers-through
Any zombie movie where people use lots of fire weapons and finde insane amounts of ammo
I wouldn't even know where to look for those
Homeless people carrying their alcohol in brown bags, or people getting pulled over and passengers having to hide that they've been drinking in the car (as long as the driver stays sober, of course)
Also people having to stay in the car and blinking into a blinding flashlight that's shining in their face, I've never experienced that here, also staying in the car is more a convenience and not a safety thing
Anything involving real estate agents and selling and buying houses, and families moving cross-country for work
It's not as prevalent here, people are more connected to their hometowns and families, and most people stay in one place, especially when they have kids (there's always exceptions of course)
And estate agents are never of the "driven soccer mum" type here, they're all of the "sleazy car salesmen" variety instead
Criminals fleeing across state borders; police not having jurisdiction across community borders; sheriffs protecting "their" town
Normal police is all federal police here
Also, people trying to get away from somebody by buying a car in cash, and just getting in and driving away
You'd have to go and get it registered before you can drive it here
In generall, less of a "just go and do" attitude here, everything needs some kind of permit and sign-up and two weeks of application procedures here; examples include going fishing (need a permit and take an exam for that), buying a car, opening a business
People being on federal land, and also people being chased from rural private properties by shotgun-weilding grandpas
All land is owned by *somebody* here, but in return we get to enter the uninhabited parts that are used for agriculture/forestry, as long as we don't damage anything
And getting a weapon pointed at you like that would be enough reason to get the police involved, and the pointer getting in trouble, even when it's on their property
Anything involving university campuses, campus police, frat life or high school or university sports teams
Over here, university works more like a government office, you go there to get your education, but you wouldn't want to spend any of your free time there
Also no sports facilities and teams, and no "XY university" sweaters
Deparment buildings can be located all over the city, there's no one big campus
And since students are not all in one big pile, parties are not as "mardi-gras style" insane
You *can* see that type of partying on music festivals here though, and on alcohol-fueled all-inclusive trips that recent high school graduates go on
Because I just saw Stranger Things S03: Anything involving fathers getting upset about their teenage daughters dating, or parents not allowing boy-/girlfriends to stay over and being intimate
And people assuming that high schoolers don't have sex
That's all not a thing here
Any wedding drama
Doesn't mean people don't celebrate it, but it's not such a big deal here: normally there's no engagement rings, there's not such a big divide between genders where the guy has to "prove" his love by buying something expensive, girls don't assume that this day has to be the best day of their life, bridesmaids and groomsmen are just your friends coming over and celebrating with you but their clothes don't have to match, and even though stag nights are a thing, that's kind of a lower social class thing here
In total, less preparation, more just spending a nice evening with your friends and family
Anything involving strip clubs as places to go to and hang out in
I mean I'm sure they do exist, but I guess they're mostly along the border to Eastern European countries, and I imagine them to be smoky and sad places and closely linked to prostitution, and not something that you'd just go to with the guys to be manly
Definitely a place though to meet up with the local crime scene, as it's also sometimes depicted
Anything involving country bumpkin incest stereotypes
Rural areas, while sometimes poorer and less developed, are never *that* far off from civilization, what we see as "out in the sticks" is always at most one or two hours by car from the state capital
Also some rural areas are quite wealthy due to tourism
People are more conservative than in cities though, that's the same
Breaking Bad:
Walt gets cancer - goes to hospital - dies anyway eventually

I always wondered why they don't just walk to the next town
Don't get me started on that goddamn Austrian gas station
Can confirm
We teachers have to be really civil to students lest we be fired
Where do you live
It just would be like game of thrones, but only the parts north of the wall
You can get a country flair on the right
Obviously not
But your voter's notifcation card does
It works easily for Austrian dialects to switch to Austrian Hochdeutsch
Although it is more challenging for people from Vorarlberg, especially older ones
Their dialect is more related so Swiss German than the rest of Austria where the dialects are related to Bavarian
Austrians understand each other if they try to speak hochdeutsch
It could be more challenging for non German natives or for Germans the further north you come
There are some words or sayings that are only common in Austria
If you learn German as a secondary language, you will probably learn a standard Germany German
So someone from Austria could seem similar to what you described in Manchester
Younger Austrians are usually more adapted to standard German through media and it is more enforced in schools nowadays
My parents had their non language subjects teached in dialect and that is not common anymore
In Austria, we will usually switch to standard-German
We don't like it, though
It's really awkward to us
And we are very thankful for it :) I love the Scots Dialekt but if you talk too fast I am doomed
I’m from the south of Austria and i didn’t understand a word of anything when a Swiss person talks to me in Swiss German
To me its like a completely different languages
When I went to Switzerland I realized that their TV moderators, radio moderators etc all spoke Swiss German, whereas in Austria they‘d speak a kind of „High Standard Austrian German“ but not in dialect
So I think media plays much of a role here- I‘ve also realized that children/teenagers in Vienna these days talk in a veeeeery high German manner, like they‘re straight out of Hamburg
I don‘t know where they picked that up, but I guess social media
Austrian German (our standard language) isn't declining at all
Austrian dialects are declining
I was startled by this, too
It was at the supermarket and these just-turned-teenagers spoke more with a German German dialect than Austrian German
So I gave it a thought and it must have something to do with all those German YTers and streamers
Absolutely annoying, if you ask me
I wanted to slap that kid right then and there
Don't know what to say I have a considerably younger sister and she speaks way more "high" German than me
I always thought it has to do with the German TV channels etc
Even grammar differs
Eg " I hab einen Einser bekommen"  and she says " Ich habe eine Eins bekommen"....
Haha thank you
Every time I complain about that to my friends or family most of them tell me it‘s not that bad but ffs it just ain‘t the way we speak here
Ois Piefkegschroppn
[Gebrüder Marx - Piefkegschropp]
Aaah finally, a song about my deep dark fear
Although I personally speak a mixture between dialect and Standard Austrian (depending on who I‘m talking to), the thought of having children that speak like Germans is so hoat meier
Buying and selling cars within EU should be easier
It's just a pain in the ass when I want to buy a car from Bavaria (100km) from me, to get all the paperwork, different taxes, import regulations etc
Cars a a lot cheaper in Germany than in Austria because of the bigger market, but with all the additional costs it will be about the same
It just seems a bit weird, everything in the EU is free market etc
but when it comes to cars you have to buy it in your country ....
The method for billing highway tolls
Even if we allow that some countries have tolls and others don't and some have them for some highways only, and the prices will be different too, there should be a uniform electronic system for billing
And let's not even think about parking meters, they are not even standardized within each country
Crazy
SCHUKO everything
I'm quite sure that God wanted paper to be red
yes, for when you have to exit your car in dangerous spots like a highway so you don't get hit by nearing traffic
also that's why the French "yellow vest" demonstrations (that was about fuel taxes in the very beginning) used those, they were readily available and a  symbol for motorists
Because it's butt ugly while offering only negligable security benefits
Schuko ftw
**Marillenknödel (Apricot dumplings)**
Made with either potato or Topfen (idk the english word)  dough
They are then rolled in crispy fried sweet bread crumbs
They can also be filled with plums
**Potato/Bread dumplings filled with:**
- Surspeck, Idk how to translate it, but it's [basically bacon with >90% fat]
- Grammeln, greaves
They are made by cooking bacon (like the one above) in water until the water has evaporated, then they are heated until most of the fat has melted and the remains are fried until they are golden brown
- Bratknödel, filled with minced cooked beef and pork, however there are several different variants, that's just how my grandmother made them
**Germködel**
A fluffy yeasty dough filled with "[Powidlmarmelade] plum jam
The dumplings are steamed instead of cooked and served with a shitton of butter and poppy seeds mixed with powdered sugar
It's a traditional meal after skiing
**Leberknödel (Liverdumplings)**
Minced beef liver mixed with bread crumbs and spices
They are then baked and served in beef broth
Although not a filled dumpling like you asked I just wanted to include them
We have many different dishes that would fit, but I'm gonna use this opportunityto talk about one from my region that is pretty unknown in the rest of the country: [Schlipfkrapfen]
They're made with pasta dough and filled with mashed potatoes, garlick, and other spices
Boiled in salt water and served with grated cheese, chopped chives, and melted butter
You can also roast them with or without eggs
Edit: [Kärntner Kasnudeln] are similar, but filled with quark
They're definitely inferior tho
These are insanely delicious
They are really popular in Austria too - Zwetschkenknödel
Kärntner Kasnudeln
Germknödel
My eternal enemy
I hate that stuff with a passion
It's the only food where I would stand up and leave if you eat one next to me
I cannot even stand the smell
I know others love them, but to me they are totally gross
In general we have many different kind of dumplings in Austria though
Not only the ones you mentioned but of course also: Hascheeknödel (dumpling filled with ground sausage leftovers), Speckknödel (filled with Speck/Ham), Grammelknödel (what is Grammel in english
), normal Semmelknödel (made from bread), Tyrolean Speckknödel (same as Semmelknödel, with added Speck), Kartoffelknödel (made from potatos) and I am sure there are many more
I think we Austrians just love our Knödel
I'd say your special dumplings are those bohemian dumplings that get served to svickova
How dare you say Kasnudeln are inferior
I think you're the first person I've seen who doens't like Germnknödel
I forgot to mention that there a many different regional variants, I just listed the ones I eat most of the time
However I did mention Speck und Grammelknödel
AFAIK dumpling bread and potato dumpling originate in Austria/Bavaria/Czechia
Traditionally they are served without vanilla sauce, but it's often added
I'm sorry, I don't speak wrong
vanilla sauce more common with Buchteln
Whether Kaiserschmarrn is a full meal or just desert
People who put jam/nutella on whole grain bread vs people who put it only on white bread
Raisin buns are much better
Such chocolate buns aren't very good
Krapfen is the only correct word
>Puntigamer vs
Gösser
a classic "Pest oder Cholera" situation
Tomate and Kartoffel are German and not Austrian words in my opinion
I think one could also add beer vs
wine for Austria
But that would basically just be East vs
West
I dont think I ever met an Austrian who eats it for desert, for me this is a tourist only thing
I am sad that they seem to exist
I had this discussion very recently with colleagues in the university cantine
They complained about the lack of main dish and how Kaiserschmarrn alone would not make them full
I was utterly confused
Du los mei Pitti
Viennese beer (Ottakringer) is utter shite tho haha
That's not true at all :) they massively improved in the last years imo
Both of them are worse than Ottakringer in my opinion
Open the beer with another beer
Then open the second beer with the cap of the open beer
The Netherlands
My boyfriend and I went on a roadtrip to the Netherlands a few years ago and we loved every second of it
I understand that going on holiday and actually living somewhere are two completely different things, but still
I love the language, the general "feeling" of the country, how friendly everyone we talked to was, the landscape, etc
I'd love to go back again once the pandemic is over
Right now I have 4 crushes
My first one is Switzerland
Landscape wise it's basically Austria on steroids
Since more than a year I have been trying to find places in Austria that match those of our western neighbor
It's a hard race haha
So Switzerland is an envy-crush for me
Next one is Netherlands
I just love how organized everything looks there
As if one person sat down in the early 2000s and planned every centimeter of the country
My third one is the Czech Republic
I have also never been there but I do the same as you
I roam the streets on street view and I read into history and places
The crazy thing is that I study 40 mins away from the border
But due to Covid I can't visit our neighbor
This makes me  want the country even more
My last and biggest crush is Germany
I literally have feelings for this country
Not love but nostalgia
It reminds me of my childhood
As a kid I consumed a lot of German media and kids shows
The cities, the places and the technology (like Bagger 288) have always fascinated me
German cities have an amazing flair/vibe and I am sure I want to live for some years in a German city
The only thing we are missing in Austria is the sea
That why enjoyed Nice so much
You sure have many beautiful cities in your country
Also the quality of your food is amazing
Nice a favorite country of mine writes positive stuff about a favorite country of mine
And that's why we shall recreate the Empire to take back what rightfully belongs together
Pula here we come
Definitely do that ;)
I also hope to visit your wonderful country again soon my friend, had nice times there
You're always welcome here mate
Depends a lot on the countries
;-)
German:
Kopf und Schulter, Knie und Fuß, Knie und Fuß.
Kopf und Schulter, Knie und Fuß, Knie und Fuß.
Und Augen, Ohren, Nase, Mund
Kopf und Schulter, Knie und Fuß, Knie und Fuß.
I also never heard it in German
I googled it out of curiosity because of this post and found this text
Same
This one of the first songs we learned for our English classes, along with the other classic "If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands".
It is common to sing the English version however
I do remember singing it in kindergarten
Kurt Waldheim were once Secretary-General of the UN and became a persona non grata in the eyes of USA and Israel during his Austrian presidency
Only because he forgot to mention he served for the SA and may or may not participated in some war crimes
Prob Haider or Strache
-Engelbert Dolfuß
Our first fascist Leader
-Adolf Hitler
Our second fascist Leader
-Jörg Haider
Some fascist who wanted to get into power but drank to much and died in a car accident
-HC Strache
Some other fascist who got all the fans of the 3 guys mentioned before
He and his party just nuked the government coalition
A video (they didn't know they were filming it) showed him trying to sell our country to Russia
Also the video showed some coke, and him acting like low life drinking and smoking
Depends: alive or dead
Alive: Heinz-Christian Strache
Former Vice chancellor and ex-member of our far right freedom party
In June, a video was leaked that shows him basically trying to get a Russian oligarchs niece to buy our largest newspaper to advertise them
He also explains how to smuggle too high donation past the regulations and mentions multiple other people who have done so, including some of austrias most wealthy industrials
Dead:
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Basically our Basti and the one for whom you need obly his initials: H.C.
H.C. was vice chancellor up until a couple months ago, when it was found out that he tried to "sell" the country to a "niece" of a russian oligarch
The meeting was recorded (they were obviously tipsy and there was reportetly coke on the table) and leaked
H.C. was impeached (I guess you'd call it) and new elections were held in September
The problem with Basti is that he's shacking up with the right wingers, who H.C. was a part of
Also he's part of the conservative party, wich is also disliked by many
Now we'll see if we'll have a blue(right wingers)/turqoise or green/turquoise government
ImmEverybody in here should know him
Well who could that be ...
Actually he even denied it
We definitely count that one for our most disgraceful too
And the ÖVP denied it as well
With the argument that its a Jewish plot against the guy
So it's really just the same conspiracies from the övp today as it was back then
Silberstein
It was more still lingering Nazi antisemitism and having ex Nazis in the party
Yeah it was the whole "yeah just stop talking about the past" which this party still employs when their crimes from a few years ago come up so
yeah nothing has changed then
I personally often call the ÖVP  by their old CS name
Never forget who first ended democracy in Austria
Can we actually list Kurz here
Destroyed two governments in less than 24 months, and is the first person to be mistrusted enough to get thrown out as a chancellor
Of course he doesn't fit with the mass murderes from the top comments here however
He's just as is a disgrace for our country
Wait 5 years
I'd hope the country wises up before then
If he cons himself through another election he's probably going to get 45% and we are truly fucked
Kurz will sizzle out like Haider and Schüssel
Hes first and foremost a Machtmensch with no greater ambition than maintaining power
As soon as the facade he needs to maintain his popularity begins to show cracks hell lose popularity again
We all know that the ÖVP has no clue and no ambition to fix the fundamental issues of Austrian society and that it has like the FPÖ big problems with cronyism, dirty deals and (better hidden) corruption
But as soon as they slip all comes crashing down
I believe Kurz has hit a high as of now that he's not going to top
If he now panders to the left he will lose the voters of the far right that he has cultivated but If he moves even further to the far right the moderates are going to jump ship to the Neos
ÖVP dying to the Neos would be hilarious, I have to admit
At least the övp still pretends to have social ambitions
>	Her rent is slightly lower, but she lives in a small apartment (and has a deal that isn’t available to the average person), and I live in (by European standards) a medium sized house
But you live in Arizona which is one of the cheaper states to live in
I live for a while in NOVA near DC and the place I have now in Vienna is much cheaper if I would rent for approximately the same size
It’s a bit hard to compare if you don’t tell us where she lives
>	She gets about 1 week more vacation per year than I do
Then you are lucky
I didn’t have many colleagues in the US that had 4 weeks of holidays
> I work 40 hours per week, she works about 45
>	I work 40 hours per week, she works about 45
That sounds a bit weird - the normal work time allowed by law in Germany is 48 hours - yes
But most companies have work weeks with 37
5 or 40 hours nowadays - especially in the better paid fields
>	I own a car, she doesn’t. I could bicycle and use public transport to get around, but I don’t like to
She exclusively uses public transport
I could own a car in Vienna - but what for ? It would cost me around 300-400€ a month to own a decent one and I would use it only to go to work - being a public commute down from 45 minutes down to 35 minutes
>	I could bicycle and use public transport to get around, but I don’t like to
Once again you seem to be incredibly lucky - when I lived in Virginia I could literally go nowhere without a car - work was too far, shopping mall was too far, and the suburb my company put me in had no other option for shopping then that
>	I pay nothing for healthcare (covered by employer), neither does she (covered by the German taxpayer)
First - it’s covered by her employer too since the social security payments the company pays are exactly for that
But minor details
The big difference is (and that’s the game changer in my opinion) if you loose your job, you loose your insurance - if she becomes unemployed she still has insurance
This comes with so much peace of mind in difficult times
>	another major difference - SPACE
There is just more room here
My shower is made to hold a whole grown human
Hers seems to be designed for oompa-loompas
It’s the same on the road, at the store, at work
There is just so much less space where she is
No there are just more people where she is - especially in comparison with arizona
I have friends who live in Boston and New York and their places are tiny compared to what I have in Vienna and I would pay about 1/4th of what they pay if I would rent
> If you say for example you have to drive 5 miles a day that means nothing to us
And you think 5 miles a days is a big journey in Europe or what
lol
Rural areas exist in Europe too, you know
Just look for pics of US grocery stores
They have everything we have times 5(?)
Like 10 different types of milk, 200 different types of cereal, etc etc
Take the variety of products all across europe ant put it in one store - you just creates an american grocery store
I remember looking for salt and there was like two meters of aisle full of different types of salt, I just wanted simple salt damint
I‘m sure most mothers could be this „tough“ if they had to
But luckily they don‘t have to in Germany and Austria e. g.
As kids we played rock, paper, scissors, well
We just added the well but did not drop the rock
We have two different games
Rock paper scissors and Schnick Schnack Schnuck
Schnick Schnack Schnuck is basically the same but it has everything, from the normal rock, paper and scissors to towel, big rock, big paper, big towel, hole in the ground, big hole in the ground, laser gun(s), black hole and supernova
The discussion on what beats what was always fun, but somehow most of the time everybody knew what beat what (the discussion still happened lol)
PS: Idk if that was only for my school and my town or for the whole country in my childhood
(Now I barely hear Schnick Schnack Schnuck anyway)
I only knew it used from the annoying Kidw ho always wants to win, as it's the only thing which beats two other things
Naturally He didn't declare it's legal to use it beforehand
But then paper also wins against two things, so it's kinda even
Still annoying though haha
We just say „Schere, Stein, Papier“ (Scissors, Rock, Paper -the order of the words is different here)
If you add a well, paper also beats two things --> rock and well
So it's actually evened out, but I still prefer the version without well
Yeah, didn't thought in that way, but scissors still Beats only Paper and  Rock only scissors
you need an odd Number of things to choose of to be fair
Yeah that's why Rock Papier scissors Spock lizard works, but it gets complicated
Yeah, but replacing Rock with Well doesn't add something to the Game, so why should you so it for other than flavour
It's a mix of things from historical reasons to recent political decisions
The historical background of Southern Europe is a late or non-existent phase of industrialisation
The reasons for this are different for each of the south European nations
**Historical Background**
For example Spain is thought to have declined because the abundance of silver and gold from their colonies made it cheaper to buy a lot of "high tech" goods from England and Holland
Craftsmanship in these countries improved and made it possible to accumulate a capital stock to be used during the industrial revolution
Spain's craftsmen class on the other hand declined
Spain basically suffered from success
Portugal on the other hand had the issue that they were forced to sign a free trade agreement with England in the 18th century
Portugal had a thriving cloth industry during that time but the Portuguese Empire was in decline during this time
Their golden goose of Brasil, their biggest and most important colony became independent and they were at risk of being annexed by Spain
Thus they had to increasingly lean on Britain to survive as a country
The perfidious Albion exploited this by forcing a free trade agreement that included cloth on Portugal
While Portugal had a thriving cloth industry their cloth wasn't as cheap and good as English cloth and with no protections and support from this competition the industry completely declined and Portugal was thus unable to create an industrial base
(Edit: A famous thought experiment about comparative advantage came from this when the famous economist David Ricardo used the example of Portuguese wine and English cloth to advocate for free trade
That this deal was highly unequal with very different benefits should not be forgotten, it has implications to this day
Southern Italy was and is shaped by its plantation economy and its history as a foreign cash cow
Plantation agriculture on good soil in mild climate has historically been a very profitable business
Sicily for example was a bread basket of the Roman Empire and even 1200 years later Aragon, then Spain, exploited its Italian holdings fully
By the time Italy was unified in 1870 North Italy had industrialised while the South was still stuck in an agricultural economy
As agriculture mechanised more and more people went north to find work
Lastly Greece only became independent in the 18th century and even then it was a rump state largely reliant on Great Britain and other European powers to survive
Centuries under Ottoman rule weren't kind to the region as the Ottoman's rule was extractive instead of transformative
There wasn't a large burgher class nor were there any really big cities beside Thessalonica, which wasn't conquered until the 1890s. Athens at the time of Greek independence in 1830 had 4000 population
Half of the ten million people of Greece nowadays live there and it should not surprise that the city is the focal point of the modern economy
**Modern Times**
What all four countries/regions have in common is that from the 70s on credit became cheap for these governments
Portugal, Spain and Greece all became democracies and joined the EU making it an attractive investment
Politicians in these countries then used the cheap money to plaster over structural deficiencies with deficit spending
When interest increased too high a lot of times Italy for example devalued its currency
The interest rates only decreased more when the Euro was created
Credit became unbelievably cheap and fuelled spending habits even more
Add to that a housing bubble and you have a dangerous mix
That's not to say that there were no attempts to alleviate the situation
Under the Franco regime Catalonia became the economic powerhouse of Spain and Italy tried for decades to industrialise the South
In Italy however subsidies resulted in an insular economy as  Northern firms simply constructed and operated works which got their resources from the north and which sent their products to the north for further processing
When subsidies ran out these factories often simply closed up shop and moved elsewhere
**The crises of 2008 and Austerity**
When the Great Recession started in 2008 the whole house of cards began to crumble
As the crises spread interest rates for for the PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain) began to rise but through the Euro these countries had no way of helping their economy by for example devaluing their currency
2010 was a time in which state bankruptcy of all PIGS was feared and discussed
Greece especially was in a bad position
What then happened can only be described as an overreaction from Germany and other Northern states
All PIGS countries were forced to endure harsh austerity measures
This is nowadays considered a huge mistake as the austerity measures prolonged the crises and solidified unemployment as government investment was needed to end the crises quickly and jumpstart the economy
Nowadays one can see a lost generation of people which were never able to obtain a stable job for a decade or more
It all starts with corruption
Lots of corruption
You raise a lot of good points I, myself, have thought about (I study economics)
A transfer union is necessary for an integrated economic bloc like the Eurozone, however I (and basically every other observer of EU politics) currently finds it highly unlikely to push forward such further integration for the foreseeable future
The other option of trying to create infant industries in these countries is highly unlikely as most subsidies and contracts have to be written out EU-wide and protectionism is de jure and de facto impossible
The four principles of the EU forbid this
I personally consider the last option you speak about most realistic
The current trajectory of most Southern and Eastern European countries is to slowly bleed out of human capital until there are only a few urban regions left with wilderness around it
Spain and Portugal will suffer less because they have former colonies from which people migrate because of the shared language but Southern Italy and especially Greece will suffer
That is not to forget how Eastern Europe is the most screwed region of all
/u/LXXXVI has mentioned it in spirit but the region bleeds out of human capital in exchange for subsidies
The only way for Eastern countries to stabilise in population is to poach it from others in the region
Without Ukrainian refugees as a labour force Poland's economic growth would choke and die
PIS may want for Poles in the UK and Germany to return to the fatherland but that window may have already passed and a good proportion of those migrants may stay permanently there
The Baltic countries will probably atrophy into de facto city states as population decline will empty their countrysides and the remaining population moves to the capital or abroad
Romania and Bulgaria both suffer from the fact that a lot of emigrants are those that have not yet reproduced and if they never return both countries are stuck with bad demographics
That's not to forget that currently a whole generation is growing up being primarily cared for by their grandparents
As for the Balkans they aren't that much better off
While Slovenia can rely on other Balkan migrants Serbia for example bleeds human capital as many educated and learned professionals from craftsmen to doctors are leaving the country for Germany or other greener pastures
Unless women in these affected countries suddenly bear 3-4 children each their fate may be softened but not prevented
Spain is both Western Europe and Southern Europe, one could call the country's position South-Western in Europe
Thank you for your praise and if you want to ping someone you have to use /u/, like /u/Ragadast335
As far as I know at least in Czechia an important reason why the population decline is less of an issue is that not many people left the country in the first place and the natural decline of the population is nowadays evened out by Ukrainians
not sure about Slovakia but about those I do know is that a lot workers commute to Austria for construction jobs and other work
Austrians spend on average 325€/month on food
How about your country
> on average 325€/month
Man some people must live really cheap, because sometimes it feels like I spend this in a week
Since my work has quite cheap but good food for very little (€3-4/meal) I get away with spending less than €150/month
However, I usually don't eat breakfast, so it's mostly just dinner (I usually just a "Jause" instead of a full-blown meal) and Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays
560€ total, so only 140€ per person
That would seem very low
idk, 325€ seems about right for when I lived in Austria, but I'm surprised how many people from similarly priced countries spent only like 150€/month or something like that
Well in my last job I went to lunch every day, so make that 10€ per day for that alone (so about 200+€ per month)
Then I got two fixed appointments per week that come to at least another 100€ per month (10-15€ per night in drinks), Leaves me 25€ which is barely enough to get pizza delivered twice
So at least in my last job I'd hit 500€ a month easily, and that's without going out for fancy dinners
Just the drinks at my farewell party for the team were like 250€ or so
[George W. Bush thanked then Australian prime minister John Howard for visiting the Austrian troops in Iraq
Putin recently made fun of this, when he said, that it's hard to talk seriously to people who confuse Austria with Australia
\*looks what trump might have said about Austria*
Man, i cant find it but i am halfway sure that some south korean Politican on visit, said something like “Germany should consider itself lucky that it doesnt have to endure the pain of a divided nation“ in front of the Bundestag
That was before the unifcation
[... there are kangaroos in Austria]
Doesnt matter, we are used to it
I mean technically Poland was independent, although heavily influenced and controlled by the SU
He has the best words
But it makes more sense for Germany (or Austria, dont worry) than the Netherlands
I mean its stupid anyway but he clearly didnt knew about netherlands history while saying this
Generally yes, but only if those people meet the same obligations as my countries inhabitants (e.g. conscription)
My brother lives outside Austria and has the citizenship of the country he resides in and Austria
He is not allowed to vote but also doesn’t have to spend 6 months in the Army like other male citizens
If he were to be allowed to vote, in my opinion, he also should have to join the Army
After long residence in the country yes
People shouldn't have to go through all the hassles of getting citizenship, especially here where you can't get ours without giving up your previous one
Yes of course
In Vienna more than 30% of the population can't vote in their state/local elections because they are not citizens
That's a huge democratic deficit
Everybody interested in this topic should check out [Voters without Borders] , this is a european citizens initiative calling for full political equality of EU citizens using their freedom of movement
Noticed the same trend
Then they should become citizens
Just a little heads up: EU citizens can vote on a local level *everywhere* in the EU, if they have their permanent residence there
It's an EU law
And force them throw away their current citizenship
Not good
In a united Europe and a globalised world it only makes sense to allow multiple citizenships
As long as that's not the case: allow them to vote
Not very
In former eastern block countries you used to be able to get by with German and Russian but with younger people it's just English
Recently went to Norway and actually quite a lot of people spoke German and even at a museum the descriptions were in Norwegian, English and German
I've had it the other way round, I hat to talk to Swiss people in English because I could NOT understand their German at all - same with some Alemannic dialect speakers within Austria
Isn't Hungarian somehow connected
Well yes that's the whole point of Schengen, isn't it
I unintentionally crossed the Austrian-Italian border by car with only an Austrian learner's permit (L17)
We only switched drivers when we saw the sign "Galleria non illuminata" and therefore noticed that were already in Italy
Because Italy doesn't allow under 18-year-olds to drive (I was 16 back then) we had to change
> Is it completely painless
By car: Depending on the country, you either have to buy a sticker to put on your windshield to use the Highway (Like in Austria and the Czech Republic) or you have to pass through a toll gate and pay to use the highway (Like in Spain or Italy)
Besides that there are no checkpoints
By train: Nothing happens at all
On the OEBB RailJet, when I crossed from the Czech Republic into Austria, the displays switched from displaying stations in Czech and German to German and English
Some trains might give an announcement the station before the border (i.e. "This is the last station in Austria")
By plane: You land, grab your luggage, and leave
Thats it
The only other hassle that I can think of is that you might have to change currencies
> Do you need to slow down
Only if the speed limit changes from country to country, or if marked
Trains can slow down as well, but that is usually due to rail quality changing
> Are there occasional controls / roadblocks
Very rarely
It can be that a country temporarily suspends Schengen and enforces border checks, like Germany did in 2015
Random cars can be stopped as well, though this is relatively uncommon
> Is it moving in the direction of easing up or hardening
I don't know, but the EU recently allowed Croatia to join Schengen, which I presume is a good sign
> How does it affect you and other residents
Schengen allows you to do a lot of things which would be harder or even impossible to do in other countries, like
Work in country a and live in country b, as living in country b is cheaper
Buy groceries in another country
Take a day trip to another country
etc
Often the only way to notice is because you get a text from your provider that says that you crossed the border
Usually when I go to Croatia the border control guy is too busy playing candy crush to even look at my face/plate
As long as you're not traveling with a vehicle that can transport a large number of people/goods you practically wont be bothered, and when you do they just ask for a passport (have no experience as a truckdriver/drug smuggler so can't talk about that part)
It's the other way around, Germans "closed" their borders to Austria due to human trafficking
Depends on which border we're talking about
In the countryside, I've crossed the border without even realising (and ended up in Hungary or Czechia) several times
On the motorway, however, it can be a real pain in the ass, especially during peak travel times
You won't hear disagreements from me
Sorry, It
Nope, borders are "open" there
Just the Germans that are controlling us

It’s not German and I’m not used to it
I’m a religious Weißbier drinker but maybe on a road trip sometime I could try it
Germans ofc
I am Austrian and many people here make fun of Burgenland, which is a state of Austria
Germany, obviously
Sonetimes the Netherlands because if the tourists
Wait
you guys are only joking
I wouldn't say that
The typical 'neighbour joke" in Austria is usually about the next state, not another country
Like Carinthians have the Styrian jokes for example
The hard-on for German jokes on /r/Austria and /r/aeiou are mostly just a Reddit thing
I mean Austria is probably one of the most irrelevant neighbours for Germany after all
Yeah, the tings we say about germans aren't a joke
>I mean Austria is probably one of the most irrelevant neighbours for Germany after all
Are you drunk
Bavarian economy has a shit ton to do with Austria but ok m8
Is it still a joke even if it's true
I mean, we did make a movie called Piefke Saga and called it "satire"
> Or not joking but generally thinking that something Austrian is German
Oh you pesky Prussians :P
>Are you drunk
Unfortunetaly not
Dunno, I live in Eastern Austria and we never interact with Bavarians at all, so there's that
Can confirm, our diaspora is a whole lot different compared to that of Western Austria
Less Germans, more Eastern Europeans
We Eastern Austrians don't really have mountains, and I wouldn't say we are culturally closer to Germans than to Czechs here, so there's that
>the food is like German Food
Now that's the worst insult I've heard in my life
And last time I checked, Bratislava was not a part of Czechia :P
>I was in Vienna a few weeks ago, your bread is like German bread, the food is like German food, the beer tastes like German beer and your towns look like German towns
Well I could say basically the same about my visits to Prague (besides linguistics of course)
>You just don't wanna acknowledge the fact that the idea of Austrians not being Germans was fabricated in the last 100 years
Our nationality being an artificial one doesn't change the fact that only the worst kind of right-extremists would still consider us German
(Hope I didn't sound like I dislike Germany either; it's one of my favourite countries for travelling, but I can't say I feel all too close to it
But then again I don't really feel close to the Alpine Austrians either)
>Point was, 40km to the east seems like a bigger change than 1000 km to the northwest

Thermostat in my apartment is always set to 23° but I think it's off, feels more like 21-22°.
Under 20° would be cold to me
Except in the bedroom, I like thick comfy blankets so I keep it at 18-19°.
19° - 20°, that's comfortable for me
At night, 17°. 15° and below would be cold, if I'm not moving around
23°C below that and the madame gets cold feet and conversations tend to get monotopical until I readjust the setting
Sweatpants and t-shirt usually these days
They don’t want to, like Switzerland
Is the fact that you have to follow EU rules without having a say in it not a big deal for you
Because thats the tradeoff for it and you still pay into EU budget as far as i know, but i dont know if you would pay more as a member
Is there any kind of discussion about it or people people complaining about it
Hard to find anything in in English about it, when i look for it, I only find stuff about how the British would feel about a deal like that
Scandinavians and making up "trendy" new words for universal everyday concepts, name a more iconic duo
We have a word if you feel shame for somebody else - it's called "Fremdschämen"
They basically made their own Fremdschämen
No, why
The German use "Handy" as a word for "cell phone" is a [pseudo-anglicism] completely unrelated
Completely
Sure there are some areas where the drunks hang out and whatnot but Vienna is as safe as can be
Vienna: Totally fine in every part of the city
There's one or two spots close to party areas that I know can be filled with drunk and rowdy people at certain times at night (Stadtbahnbögen, Bermudadreieck), wouldn't want to be among them if I can avoid it but more for convenience considerations (loud, obnoxious) than for those of safety
Same during the day, there's a few spots (Bim-Station Westbahnhof, Praterstern, Gumpendorfer Straße) where drunks/crazy guys hang out and it's dirty, but it doesn't feel unsafe, just annoying
There's also spots with high percentage of immigrants (Reumannplatz, Brunnengasse) and those can feel busy/dirty in their own kind of way, but are completely safe day and night
(guy in his 30s for reference)
I only had one scary encounter in Vienna but that was in the city's poorest district
Other than that I've never had a bad experience and neither did my friends as far as I know
Very
I see older women (60+) walking by themselves at past 23:00
I’m a woman who lives in Vienna
I’ve never felt unsafe being out and about alone at night, but obviously I always keep an eye out for suspicious people nonetheless
~290k, have always felt very safe when walking late in the evening or at night, everywhere
There are some parks where the drug dealers hang out, which can feel a bit unpleasant sometimes, but it's not like they're interested in anything than selling their stuff, so
It's as safe a city as any
Wow, I realized I'm totally new to the concept of mugging
Does it normally happen at gunpoint, or with a knife
Or is it just the implied violence that makes victims cooperate
And are there normally more than one muggers, if there's any "standard" way of mugging that is
Oh and finally, would it make sense to carry decoy wallets with less cash/cards in them
When I try to get home fast at night, some women are still afraid and tend to speed up although it's in the 6th district which is kind of upper class
Seconded
Never had any problems, and I used to live in  generally "not so nice" area and I never had any problems walking Home
This
I grew up in Aschaffenburg and there walking through the city at night was no issue at all
Frankfurt was definitely scary though
Yea that's still rather common unfortunately
If you can just change to the other side of the street or something like that
Makes them feel safer, for basically no effort on your side
I wish it wasn't necessary though
Very sorry to hear that
Yes, that's something I try to do, but it usually takes me to long to realise, that she is almost running because of me
What I saw being mentioned in one of those threads where girls were replying on how to deal with this is to take out your phone and pretending to be on a call
For some reason it's way less threatening if you know the person is occupied/minding their own business/not being sneaky
Haven't tried it yet (because pretending to be on a call is awkward as hell, haha), but might give it a go if I'm in that situation and need to call somebody anyway
I would say traditional music bands often have a Hammered dulcimer and a Zither
I'd say the [Zither] :) You might have heard the [Harry Lime theme] from The Third Man
Quintessential Vienna, it features a lot in the city's own musical genre Wiener Lied, but also in Alpine song
I once watched a BBC production where they used that melody to introduce the Rhineland and I was utterly outraged and finally understood cultural appropriation - it's not German goddammit
Another Alpine instrument is the Hackbrett, but Styrian Accordion, Violas and Guitars also feature a lot in traditional music
I like to picture the Alphorn as some sort of Swiss didgeridoo, it makes both instruments infinitely more funny (maybe it's just because i'm easily entertained)
Don't forget the most amazing instrument, the [Txalaparta]
That's a very viennese thing to say
For me it would definitely be either the Sterische Harmonika or the Hackbrett
Fun fact, the modern harmonica/akkordeon/squeezebox was invented in Vienna (Cyrill Demian had the first patent in 1829), and made it's glorious and incredibly rapid spread all over Europe and into the New World (including the folk music of the southern US and Argentinian tango music) from there
It's really fascinating how this instrument is considered "typical" in so many different places
France, the Basque country, Argentina, Russia, Hungary, the Balkans, the whole North Sea region, the whole Alpine region, among Ashkenazi Jews, among Romani, in the American Deep South etc
It is
It's on the border to Slovenia but Styria is also a historical region, the border wasn't always as it is today
I'm not actually Viennese :) My very countryside dad plays Zither and Bratsche, so those are naturally the first folk instruments I thought of
Sounds familiar :)
Probably the Sieges of Vienna by the Ottomans (plural because they tried two times)
I think it was kind of important in Europe history generally, because it would have made a difference if the Ottomans were able to control Vienna as it was a important city that time
I grew up and live in a small village, the most notable event would probably be the explosion of our powder magazine in 1782
Another notable thing is that our village had it's 1000th anniverary in 1930
So in 10 years we will have our 1100th anniversary
I live in a small village, so not very much has happened here
But there was this one time when during ww2, a small hall was to be built, and before the building process started, there was a ceremony
At said ceremony, the commander of the villages Wehrmacht soldiers should "bless" the upcoming building process by hitting the first of the foundament plates to be laid down with a hammer, something along the lines of "three hits for the Führer". In his enthusiasm, he hit the plate so hard that it broke apart
Of course yes, forgot to say that :)
This is Austria, good sir
Traditions are held higher than progress
Oh there are tons, so this is by far not a full list but just some examples:
* hut - (Hut = hat)
* arm - (poor ; however: **A**rm means the same as the English word)
* list - (List = trick)
* mode - (Mode = fashion)
* pole (Pole = Polish man)
* rat (Rat = advice)
* roman (Roman = novel)
* sense (Sense = scythe)
* see (See = lake)
* toll (toll = great)
* wand (Wand = wall)
We also have lots of 'false friends' between English and German, so words might ot be identic but since the pronunciation of certain words or phrases are the same it is easy to get the translation wrong
I suggest a quick google search if you want to take a look at some examples, you will find hundreds of lists
It's not an actual word in German, but thanks to the LEGO-like properties of German (compounding), "Sausage" can mean "pig-tale" (like a tale about a pig, not the hair style)
Vater means father in German, but in Spanish it's toilet bowl
Yeah, both words are also related, English gift is related to "give". And German poison is Gift, because it's something you "give" someone (without their knowledge ideally)
The original meaning (something you give) is preserved in the old-fashioned German term "Mitgift" (With-gift), which means "dowry".
Die Bart, Die
You are correct
Mentally prepare yourself that a lot of things will be different, even things you didnt expect and which are really annoying (for example costumer service here)
Dont complain to locals about it or tell them how its better in the USA, if you need to complain rhen text your friends or family about it, they will share your discomfort
Europeans will just think youre an ignorant jerk
Also, use your inside voice outside and your outside voice inside
>How can I travel to Europe without annoying the locals
Well the question itself is kinda annoying already
Europe isn't one country and in every single country you can have different regions with different cultures
It's like asking an American how to behave in Mexico
But overall: don't speak too loudly, don't tell us how everything is better in the US and don't expect customer service to crawl up your ass and you'll be fine
Source: Been here most of my life as an American
Don't stand on the left of an escalator
Don't block any exits staring at your map or your mobile phone
Respect and also:  don't go to big tourist destinations and expect deals, be disapointed when you don't get them, and complain about the local prices
(Have seen this several times from backpackers in Italy)  Also, go to the South of Spain if you want to go to the med
> Also, use your inside voice outside and your outside voice inside
This so much
Especially the "Thank you
" is very important IMO
A Trailer Park Boys reference
Well, but mainly they support the international chain that owns the hotel they're staying at, or the fastfood chains they're eating at, the airline, etc
Not much the general population profits from

How wild would it be if the Pope was a shitposter
My Russian husband wanted to give me constantly money, I had to get used to that
My boyfriend is Colombian and oh my, he eats a lot of stuff that makes my poor Austrian heart crumble
Like rice cooked with pasta, or cheese with Arequipe
But thinking back to my first time drinking hot chocolate with marshmallows I had the same feeling
*Shouldn't* go together, but it does
I'd be willing to try hot chocolate with cheese

"Europe is utopia so let's walk there"?
each and every "untranslatable expression" is like that, to be honest
yes, I might need more than one word to fully convey the meaning, but no, it *can* be translated
and no, it's not gonna be a totally alien concept to you, just mildly interesting
but who would click on that, right
US-Korean friend of mine has such a hard time getting work as a language teacher in Asia (she's mostly in ML China), even though she has extensive education on the subject and is really knowing what she's doing
People would rather hire random Caucasian people that are tall and blonde, and while their English isn't horrible, it's not at a native level either, and they definitely don't have a language teacher education
Seems what people actually want is not a good teacher, but a tall blonde clown to make your school feel cultured and worldly
this one is my favourite by far
just the perfect mix of cute and stupid
imagine you have a restaurant next to the Eiffel tower and you allow tourists to use your toilet for free - congrats, you're now running a toilet, not a restaurant
You gotta admit that's hilarious though
"Blackensippen"
You're right, I wouldn't be surprised if that happened here as well
To be honest I'd expect the opposite to happen more often though, that people don't really want to have anything to do with darker skinned people
idk where you went but in most places its really easy
tourist area (does not have to be a tourist trap, just a place that gets tourists) = pay toilet
non-tourist (meaning residential or rural) area = free toilet but rather dirty
exceptions might be made for busy train stations or areas frequented by lots of homeless folks or junkies
I honestly can't remember the last time I paid for a toilet around here or even on holiday elsewhere on the continent
anyway, I don't really get whats the big deal about paying 50 cents to keep the place clean and junkie free
I think you are a bit too far west if you exclude Hungary, but include the Dutch parts of the low countries
Vienna, in my current district, a 50sqm apartment seems to be the best you could get
A literally mansion
I bought my big House for about the half of it
Edit: at the Border of Styria and Burgenland , near a big city 400
000 is quite the Standard prize for a 120m² House
Innsbruck, Tyrol: with 400€ you can have a 40-60 sqm flat together with two roommates
Of course each one of you has to pay 400€.
Edit: Sorry didn’t see the K.
For 400K you can buy a small flat
In the city 50sqm
In Linz (the 3rd biggest city in Austria) you can get a 90-100ish m² flat in nice condition, which is slighty more expensive than Vienna due to the freer housing market here :/
In my town I get one half of a newly built house (=shared wall with an identical half): 120 m², 5 rooms (3 bedrooms) and a smallish garden, no cellar, carport for 1 car
Or an equal sized flat with 2 garage spots, but without garden
Yay
In Austria it depends
In my area (countryside with no city nearby, touristy region) you get a flat with about 80m^2
A empty lot of like 400m² to 500m².
Or  50 - 60 m² flat depending on the quality of the flat
In my middle sized town
Northern Tirol, smaller town:
Apartment wise: - new built: a 60-70m2 two bedroom modern apartment with a garage spot and balcony/garden
- a goodcondition apartment about 10-15 years old, 2-3 bedroom, with 80-90m2
Most will have a garage spot and a balcony/garden
- an older apartment that may need some work, 3 bedroom, 90-110m2
May have a garage spot
Land: roughly 500m2 of land to build on
This is just the land, nothing else
House: pretty much nothing
If you can find a house for the price it will have very little land, be small (under 100m2), and/or need complete renovation/tear down
A nice appartment with about 80m2 if you're lucky
No houses are available in that price range though
where do you live if I may ask
a quick search and I found around 2
800 results with the parameters >50sqm and <400k€ all across the city
My brother found an 80sqm apartment for 320k. 13th district
But i have to say it was a lucky find
Maybe in Burgenland
Try to fine me something like this near Vienna or Salzburg
So 500k gets you a house but 400k only a one bedroom
yeah i reckon there are not that many areas where 400k can't at least get you 60-70sqm, unless you want some luxuries like a balcony or a garage, then you'll be passing that number fast
19th is generally considered to be a rich district (there is affordable stuff as well though), has a lot of greenspace and is on the outskirts of the city
So yeah it's pretty nice
I live in one of the inner districts, I don't want to specify exactly which one
haha then your uncle must be loaded if he‘s living there
I live in the 9th, too, and can confirm that both districts are pretty neat for living
There is some affordable stuff there too, it's not only villas and shit like that
Yeah, usually utility closet doesn't count as well
I'll give you his adress, but i'll pm it to you, i'm a cautious person
Not a "trap" per se, but the whole inner city of Vienna has become a huge luxury mall full of international brand stores you can find in ever other bigger destination, too
It's just so utterly boring
I've never been there, but this restaurant is said to be a legend in Vienna for being the pinnacle of overprized with bad food and even worse service:
You can also check out their google reviews
They even had the "honor" of getting an article in a major newspaper:
I actually thought that price per 100g was quite common for the region
However it always was directly noted with the price, not the small print
Please provide the links
I have been to Barcelona (as an incentive by my company) for (only) 3 days and instantly fell in love with that city
I know it's very touristy, but the mixture of the old part of the city, the olympic part and then the huge beach is just something very special for me
I definitely plan to go there again on my own terms after Corona
Btw, I know this is totally weird: but I really had the "luck" of getting the worst food in Barcelona
It was horrendous
I mean I KNOW you have great food, but whereever we went to, it was awful
So I need to catch up on this part massively
In German there's a type of tree cricket that's named *Weinhähnchen* (little wine cock), maybe that has the same reason ... whatever that might be
There are subs for each country and those are mainly in the native language
See /r/Austria , for example
we read and write in english
most of the european countries have to have english in their curriculum, so most of us speak it
so it isn't really a problem, there are subreddits for speficic languages or countries, like r/Austria
I’ve never had the idea to translate my posts
I want other people to tell me about my mistakes so I will get better
Just speak French and hope for everyone else to either speak it or just don't give a fuck that they don't understand you
Don't forget r/aeiou
I went back to English and then back to German:

works best for newspaper articles and the like, they're so good it's kinda scary
mostly because there still are _some_ mistakes but the rest is so good that you wouldn't look for them, since it reads *exactly as if a real person wrote it*. but at the end of the day, they're the same mistakes a human translator would make as well if he's not super careful
raises all kinds of questions about proof of authorship and the like

Jakob Schuldverschreibung - rolls off the tongue so nicely
We do have the "Parterre" or "Erdgeschoss" which is the ground floor
Some houses instead of the "Parterre" do have the "Mezzanin" which is a bit higher than the ground floor (4-5 steps)
After the Ground floor you have the 1st floor - or "Erster Stock" etc
The house I currently live in has a Parterre (ground floor, there's two shops there), Hochparterre (slightly higher ground floor, you walk up about half a level to get to the first flats), a Mezzanin (normal height, more flats) and only then there's the first floor, which I live on
The lift buttons go cellar (K) - Hochparterre (E) - Mezzanin (M) - 1 - 2 - 3
A mezzanine is pretty typical for old buildings in Vienna, Hochparterre aren't terribly uncommon either
Outside of Vienna I'd expect an Erdgeschoss and then first floor
The floor on street level is the Erdgeschoß or Parterre or Ground floor, in some buildings have a Hochparterre or Tiefparterre a ground floor that isn't actually on the level of the street (above or below)
Older buildings also tend to have a Mezzanin a kind of floor between floors, normaly an area in 19th century buildings that was often used for commercial purposes
After that you have the first floor
There is a nice book by a German born comedian who describes how he moved to Vienna
One of the little stories was that he had to carry a friend from a 3rc floor party down the staircase, which actually entailed carrying her down 6 floors
So wie es in allen zivilisierten Ländereien ist
> However if the basement is half underground (súð) then that might be considered the first floor instead of a basement
Even if you don't enter the building through that basement
Anywhere I've lived the Mezzanin was just the first floor
The few steps up I'd call Hochparterre
Bis Wien mit dem Mezzanin daherkommt
that's because Geschoß ≠ Geschoss
~~former is floor in the context of building levels; latter is projectile~~ see below
Erdgeschoß, Halbparterre, Hochparterre, Mezzanin, Erster Stock – or, as other countries would call it, fifth floor
Wenn man es nicht erster Stock nennt, ist es auch keiner
yeah
it's an Austria/Germany thing
I made a mistake though, here *both* projectile and floor are spelled and pronounced Geschoß [ɡəˈʃoːs], and in the North *both* are spelled and pronounced Geschoss [ɡəˈʃɔs]

[Blood types] were discovered by  [Karl Landsteiner] though

>the polio virus
Holy shit, we invented the polio virus
It always depends - the political theory ? So Marx and Engels ? I would be proud about that since this is still the base on which things like social - democracy and social reforms were based on and developed from
I wouldn’t be proud on the execution in ex soviet block states though
Well, then China
TIL
So Landsteiner discovered blood types before Janský, but only discovered three (A, B, O) and not four, which led to the American medical commission officially acknowledging Janský's discovery over Landsteiner's in 1921
It's been a running gag in Austria over the last year
A Krapfen (very similar to a Berliner), filled with jam but then also with a slice of meatloaf in the middle
It's disgusting
Ah okay
I thought you meant to write "polio vaccine". But that also makes sense
If Plague Inc
has taught me anything, then that identifying a virus is the most important step to eventually finding the vaccine
In Styria we have a community called Grossklein (bigsmall), right next to it there's a community called Kleinklein (smallsmall)
Sadly there is no place called Grossgross and I was very devastated finding it out
Lots of villages called Oed here, which directly translates to dull
In lower austria we have a very friendly thing to say about viennese:
when wiener (viennese) reallised there city is shit they started immigrating to lower austria, but lower austria didn't want them so they founded a new village, threw all wiener there and called it wiener neudorf (new viennese village), but they kept coming and soon wiener neudorf was to small so they foundad a new city, threw all viennese there and called it wiener neustadt (new viennese city)
I feel personally attacked
Lol, except "Wiener Neudorf" has existed under the name "Neudorf" for a lot longer than it has been called "Wiener Neudorf". They had to differentiate it from all the other Neudorfs when they organized the postal system
Similar story for Wiener Neustadt, it was Neustadt for several centuries before they decided the name had to become less generic
Not Quite
I think it gave all the populist parties another very good argument they can use to further their anti-EU sentiment
So basically they would create the problem and then use it as a strawman
After all, the most pro-EU Austrian parties (NEOS, die Grünen, SPÖ*) all voted against article 13 while the popultists either abstained (FPÖ) or voted in favor (ÖVP)
Not saying you're not right about your assumption, they're gonna milk this cow as much as any, but when it gets there, we should remember that
^^*voted ^^unanimously ^^against ^^except ^^one ^^representative, ^^who ^^abstained
Don't forget Article 12 (or whatever it's called now) - which takes away creators' money and gives it to publishers
>So basically they would create the problem and then use it as a strawman
Yes, that's exactly how they work
Compared to all other parties FPÖ abstains the most votes, so no surprise here
This way they don't piss off their coalition partner but they can say that they didn't vote for it and EU = bad to the voters
Win Win all the way for them
Wanna bet that when it comes to implementing the local laws we'll hear a lot of "we're so sorry, we really didn't want this, it's the big, bad EU that forces us to do this"?
Until Instagram blocks the upload of your photo of you and your spouse in front of the illuminated Eiffel Tower because apparently that needs to be licensed
Not for private citizens but the filter won't make a difference
Also, within the next 2 years EU companies that are affected directly will just move abroad and new ones won't pop up in their place because why would they
And in the end people will say "nothing has happened" and we'll never hear about it again, also mainly because major media and news outlets are to profit off the directive so they're inclined to keep it that way
I agree it won't be the end of the internet
I agree that we'll most likely not hear much about it again, although for other reasons
However I do recognise that it's a stupid bill
It's a shame Art12 didn't get more spotlight
Tells you who's behind the whole thing
Who is behind it
You have a link for me where I can read it
Besides major publishers, for example the Austrian Association of bookshops and the Association of Newspapers
Also collecting societies like the AKM or Austro Mechana are naturally in favour of it (probably less concerning Art
12)
The loudest advocate for it was arguably [Springer Science+Business Media]
It's phrased in a particular way so that if a member state says "no money for you, publisher, I want the creator to get it all", that's ok
But in a case like Germany, where courts ended the old regulation, and the legislative hasn't put a new one into law, it reintroduces the very old principle that courts had abolished
And it definitely gives publishers the argument of "look at the directive, the EU says it should be this way if we can't agree on something else
It depends how Germany implements the directive on their national level
But basically everyone who has insight into this has told me that it is indeed possible

I only know that we have that word in german because I walked past the museum for abortion and contraception
I don't think anyone does it illegally anymore
Verzweifelt ("Desperate"..... I am only joking
There is no "word" for women who need to make an illegal abortion because abortion is legal here so there are basically no illegal abortions)
Call the Midwife had an episode set in 1963 where an au pair from Hungary realises she's pregnant and is shocked she can't have an abortion
All the midwives and the doctor are appalled at the thought of legal abortions even though they know the impact all these pregnancies have on women
In a later season there's a story line where the aunt (or grandma
) of a midwife is caught performing illegal abortions and they are all beyond livid (though to be fair, those were not sanitary conditions)
So interesting that that was then only a few years from the legalisation of abortions in the UK
Has Northern Ireland finally legalised it too
I know ROI repealed the 8th a few years back, but I thought NI was still forcing their young women to seek help elsewhere
> Vienna is really interesting even while being sad, morbid and enraging
Austria in a nutshell, really
The problem is that many anti-choicers do not care
They think women who have abortions deserve to die for it
In Austria it's officially illegal EXCEPT in certain situations, such as within the first three months of pregnancy, or if there's danger to health or life of mother or child
It's still in the Strafgesetzbuch
In Austria it's technically illegal, too, but there is no punishment
It's called "Fristenlösung".
They don't give a rat's ass about the fetus, they just get a hard-on from policing women's bodies

Except you've recently made it a heck of a lot harder for yourselves
Most famous
In recent history it might be the collapse of the Reichsbrücke (Imperial bridge, located in Vienna over the Danube) in 1976
On a regular morning the entire bridge all of a sudden collapsed due to a structural failure
As disastrous as it looked, fortunately it "only" cost one man his life and the bridge was rebuild later
To make matters worse, on the exact same day in 1976, the late Niki Lauda (one of Austria's most prominent sportsman ever) had its infamous crash at Nürnburg ring
It was a rather turbulent day back then
post WW2 it would be events such as the [Kaprun disaster] or the [Galtür avalanche]
As far as i remember, not only was almost everything (including several churches) destroyed, but the red light district was largely unscathed
Wow i didn't know this was the same day
Unbelievable
Wasn't there a bus on the bridge when it collapsed that was repaired and used again
Somebody already mentioned Kaprun
Also the [Lassing mining disaster]
[Salzburger Nockerl] I grew up in Salzburg and I don't know anyone who's eaten it more than once, and many people who've never tried it at all
I have a Schnitzel maybe once or twice a year
I can't be bothered to make it at home, and there's usually something else I'll rather get when going to a restaurant
Chinese tourist groups and travel agencies often request restaurant in Vienna to serve spare ribs
They apparently think this is a typical viennese dish, but nobody here knows why
And nobody here (or anywhere else in the world) would consider spare ribs typical for Austria
There must have been a chinese movie or TV show where somebody eats spare ribs in Vienna
Fucking Baumkuchen
Same here, some countries think it's super common, I had my first one at 30+.
Can confirm, I have never tried it
But it looks delicious
I worked in a restaurant that served it
It is such a pain in the ass to make and really isn‘t all that great
Looks cool though
I tried them twice
They are good, but definitely not a must have
Had onion soup couple of times
My farts became chemical weapons two hours later
I love eel, but I never realized they were a British thing
Out of all things I found out about my country because of this subreddit, I think this one surprised me the most
Spare ribs are an american dish in my mind
This reminds me of a YouTube video about what is considered prohibited/bad/a sin in each persons country and everybody said like religious things or something similar (like sex before marriage or running around without a burka (am sorry if I miswrote that or that isn‘t true, if it isn‘t please say it)) and the italian dude just started a monologue about pineapple on pizza and other foods lol
>Germans like to eat their Schnitzel with sauce, like mushroom sauce, pepper sauce, etc
/r/SchnitzelVerbrechen
They don't. They eat Petteri instead
Don't believe the other guy
They are quite nice - like a combo of Windbäckerei and Kaiserschmarrn
And they're far easier to make than everyone says
Can confirm
Sauerkraut was a big part of my grandmothers food
Thanks for taking care of that before they get even further south
Austrians eat proper Jägerschnitzel, without breading and with mushroom sauce
Man I miss Eurovision
Is there any hope we are having one this year
You have been banned from /r/Austria
No washing/Air drying of white clothes/bed sheets between Christmas and Epiphany
I didn't knew it but appearently it has something to do with the Wild Hunt
they will curse the house If they get cought in it
The "Rauhnächte", the nights between Christmas and Epiphany are in some superstitions, they should be the time were the Realms of the spirits and the living are the closests but Most of them are neither still believed Nor widely known anymore
If you clink your glasses across the arms of two other people clinking, you'll  have ugly kids/bad luck
There are also "beliefs" on how to clink with different types of beer
Normal beer is clinked at the top of the bottle or glass, wheat bear is clinked on the bottom
In Austria you get an angry mother in law
Was zum Teufel
I'm assuming you mean at school
And by folders, do you mean those loose-leaf binders to collect printouts in
Or the plastic covers for notebooks
In both cases the answer is: mostly could be any color, and if the color was mandatory, it depended on the teacher
For main subjects (German, Math, English) we often had two homework notebooks that would be handed in in an alternating manner, in that case sometimes the color was mandated by the teacher
We had such things mandated in such a detailed manner up to maybe half or end of Middle School (= 6th-8th grade), most of the time you could have any color you want though
After those grades we stopped using notebook covers altogether I think
Loose-leaf binders (as often used for "side" subjects like Biology etc) could normally also be any color you liked (at least after elementary school (= first 4 grades)
Green: Biology, Chemistry
Red: Maths
Blue: German
Yellow: English
White: Latin
Orange: Physics
Just to name a few
Maths = Red
German = Blue
English = Green
Minor subjects = The transparent one
> history is brown
lmao
In Austria I would say it is the so called "Freunderlwirtschaft" which means something like "friendship economy". Most of the solid job opportunities you only get if you have a good network of contacts
You especially see this phenomenon in the public sector which is one of the biggest employees here but still they hardly write out job offers
It's all about knowing somebody who knows somebody
Of course if you have a degree in a highly requested field like computer science this does not count for you
The people
South tyrol, yes i triggered the most of italy with that but south tyrol is the only austrian region that isn't hates by any other austrian province
Probably Graz or Innsbruck
Haven't heard too much hate about them from anyone around the country
For regions, probably yes
For cities: What about Innsbruck
Does anyone hate that
What can be said is that the provinces hate Vienna and Vienna hates the provinces
Otherwise, I think Salzburg gets the least hate
Lol, so you are saying the only thing we all like is the thing we can't have
Yeah, that sounds painfully Austrian for sure
Also East Tyrol
You can't hate it, when you always forget about it
Bilbao is not the capital of the Autonomous Basque Region
Vitoria-Gasteiz is
Bilbo is the largest city though
Also: the best Spanish region is Cantabria
Miguel Ángel Revilla told me so at least
damn rich jet-set mountian dwellers showing off their sportiness wherever they go
oh I can rant about Innsbruck allright
>provinces
So I guess you are from Vienna
I'm in Vienna and I hate Vienna too ;)
Overall the whole Salzkammergut is liked I think
rich conservative sissies the damn pampered lot of them
carinthia wannabes
best dialect though, I'll hand them that
You know that north and south tyrol don't like each other, wouldn't it be obvious then that the same is the case with upper and lower austria
Upper Austria actually
But "privince" is a common deragatory term that is employed
What we can summize from this is that we Austrians don't do the like thing very well, instead Just having several Levels of dislike xD
Accurate
I do not hate this comment as much as the other comments
I was in Tromsø last winter and while I wore Longjohns under my Jeans and thick winter boots with thick socks I saw a girl walking home from school in Adidas Sneakers ankle free
But I guess you just get used to the cold if you’ve grown up there
We went past a school and it seemed like PE class was held outside (it was something like -5 or -10°)
Also: get some Touchscreen gloves
They‘re great
What is it with these exposed ankle trend that's been going on for a few years
I mean it's totally fine during the rest of the year but when it's winter that looks just stupid, like these people don't know how to properly dress themselves
Just a lowly sysadmin writing scripts for infrastructure automation, but always English for me
English of course, I'm not a monster (also our coding standard and common sense demand it)
Either that, or emojis
I code in English, comment in English and if possible document in English too
The only exception is that I know no good translation of the word "Datenträger", so I use that as a loanword in code (as "datentraeger")
>Geraeuscheemmision
It's Geraeuschemission tho
See, that's the difference between Austrian and Swiss German ;)
Am I being whooshed
It's wrong in Swiss German too
It isn't in the marketing department because they don't know basic spelling
Among the 3 discounters in our country, which are Lidl, Hofer (Aldi Süd) and Penny, I'd say Hofer is clear nr 1, followed by Lidl and Penny
&#x200B;
The bread & stuff is pure trash, you can actually tell that they are selling products that used the cheapest flour, fruits & vegetables are also meh
But in some categories they have good deals
Hofer, Merkur and Spar are better
For me its the worst of the supermarkets and its almost only in the bad districts here
Havent been in one in more than ten years though
I know
Your merkur is a building material market, i don’t know why
Adeg, Billa, Bipa, Merkur and Penny all belong together
Boys and girls meaning kids
Rarely I'd say
Men and women as adults
Sure
I lived for seven years on and off in Hungary - never had the impression you are describing
Cricles of friends there were very mixed
A Hungarian friend was very close with his ex-girlfriend back then and nobody considered even that weird
In Austria there are people qho say that men and women cant be friends, but I think theyre the minority
How should I know
I'm lonely af :(
Yes, absolutely
Yeah I would agree, even though I have also met people in smaller villages that would disagree saying that there is always sexual tension between men and women, making true friendship impossible (which is obvious bullshit)
In Austrian schools we learned that this is part of the child development phases (may be an outdated concept nowadays, not sure)
Basically the idea is that kids in kindergarden don't care about the gender of their friends, but between ~8 and ~13 they segregate into their gendered peer groups for some reason (that's also the age where kids show a lot of tribal behaviour elements)
After that it's common again to have friends of the other gender
How do you answer the phone
For private calls in Austria most people answer the phone by saying their family name
How is it in your country
> For private calls in Austria most people answer the phone by saying their family name
Imo this only applies to numbers you don't know/recognize or people you are not on a first name basis with
In any other case (non-business calls) it would be a regular greeting ("Hallo", "Griasdi", "Servas"....etc)
I let the caller speak first because he/she is the one I assume that wants something from me, and then decide according to that, what to do next
More formal conversations are often like that: [Other person: "Hello this is ... . Am I talking with ... ? Me: "Yes it is ... here, what is it about
Casual conversations are more like: "Heeey wasup
It's meee
I stopped saying my name for numbers I don't know long ago
You called me you know who I am
So a "hallo" has to surfice
Living in Switzerland there is also those super annoying calls about health insurance or other call centers
When I suspect one of those (i.e. it is a land line) I usually don't even say hello and just wait
Puts them off their script every time
well the first written record of the name Ostarrichi was in 996
thats whats usually taken as the founding of Austria
1024years old
The name *Ostarrîchi* (Austria) has been in use since 996 AD when it was a margravate of the Duchy of Bavaria and from 1156 an independent duchy (later archduchy) of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation
Persian culture and history is amazing
Always sad to see "hurr durr Iran, sand and terrorists" comments
i dont really think that counts, as the magyars werent really a country but a horde until they christianized
* A region named Ostarrichi existed probably since 976
* The oldest written record about this name etc
(that still exists) is from 996
* 1156 A separate country (at least a duchy within the HRE)
* 1451 The duke became HREs emperor
* 1803/1806 Austrian empire, now independent from HRE (which stopped existing)
* 1955 Re-founding of the state, in it's current form
I still like the argument that Austria is actually the last remaining piece of the HRE
I know that argument requires a little bias, but still
You forgot 1918, the dissolution of the monarchy and foundation of the 1st republic
The "region" that existed was a march of the HRE (under Bavarian overlordship), so it seems it was a separate entity but didn't necessarily have a name related to Austria
Usually I rent a trailer
If it's to large for a trailer i let it deliver by a flatbed
Furniture stores often have a "Pritsche" (small flatbed) to rent too
Most furniture stores offer light trucks or trailers for rent, depending on how much you buy it might even be free
Alternativly most offer delivery
BTW drywall isnt something you will find all that often in most of Europe
having a van in the family, this would be way more common than somebody owning a truck (also you'd not be able to use it to transport stuff in winter or when it rains
chances are higher with relative who own a business or are tradesmen
alternatively, you own, borrow or rent a trailer
if things are not too big, you'd probably try using a normal station wagon with the seats folded down (because of storage space, station wagons are quite common here, don't know why that's not the case in the US), or putting it on the roof of a normal car with some bungee straps or tension belts
if things are really big, nothing beats renting a dedicated car
rental's close by, and it's cheap enough for a few hours
all that being said, if you get construction material like a pallet of bricks and order a sizeable amount, you'd normally have it delivered to your home
it's normally free, so why deal with it yourself
also we don't do much construction with drywall
The vans are always white and unmarked and the men that come with the can never speak good german
But they're the friendliest and most hard working people I've met
>But they're the friendliest and most hard working people I've met
Except a ton of them are scammers :D
Really
Only problem I had was them not understanding what I want them to do
Was the grill preassembled
I bought one toolast year , fit nicely into my mid sized car
But I had to assemble it at home as it came in parts
Also people do not move that often in Europe on average
Same anywhere in the world when people realize you are Austrian instead of German they become nicer
people used to call them Tante (aunt), same as with kindergarten teachers
not as common anymore nowadays I think
"Hauptschule" has cooking lessons, "Gymnasium" not
The cooking book you get there is really good, my wife use it still today
Only some very basic things
In my 5th grade, yes, we had a cooking class, they showed us how to do simple thing, gave us recipes, it was a cooking class, and it was "mandatory" (isn't enforced or something but you have it as a subject)
Yes we had, but only one year in secondary school
Some of the damn best recipes ever
We had a cooking class in primary school
I had cooking lessons in gymnasium
A working knowledge should be required
Official business and everyday interactions should be possible to master
I dont mind at all
As long as somebody has a job in which he doesnt need German, I dont see the necessity of it
I don't care about people learning our language or "integrating" as long as they respect and obey our laws
Honestly, I coudn't care less about citizenships in general
I think it would probably be good for people living in any country to know the country's language, so they can communicate - for their sake
I figure it must be pretty hard to live in a country if you don't speak the language
But apart from that I really don't care
And I also don't think I should have any authority to decide whether people should gain citizenship in my country or not - after all I've just been born into it
Pure chance
The whole idea of citizenships is a bit absurd in a globalized world
I realize it is still a necessity since different citizenships grant you different rights, unfortunately
But we - humanity as a whole - should probably get over it
I think it’s a difficult question
One one hand yes - I want people who want to become Austrians to be able to communicate with their future countryman
I mean this is also the basis of communal participation - starting from doctors / school visits to elections
So yes - some German should be required
But now there is the question : how much ? And should there be an age limit ? If someone comes here as refugee and is 55 he can obtain citizenship with 60 - is it realistic that he learns the language on the needed level for that at such an age ? And is it needed ?
In the end a B1/2 Level can be archived fairly easily - but does that mean that they speak the language ? It just means he sat in a classroom and a test was taken
I suspect that with *some* countries including Austria the concept of "citizenship" will be watered down in the following decades until all it means is the obligation to do military sevice (for males only ofc)
At that point nobody will want to become a citizen any more
Following that, the very principle of having an official language will be dropped because it won't be workable any more
Having any sort of privilege connected to citizenship or trying to enforce a national language will sound like nationalistic madness to future generations
I'm conservative enough to not like this one bit, but I think it's in the cards
There's a golden visa program
You don't even need Spanish language with that
Just money, although Spanish is a beautiful language imo
Thats sad
I studied art at an international summer academy, and all of our projects were ours to take home after we were done with them
The one thing we were not allowed to do was to sell them during the final exhibition because this was just for showing off everyone's work and not a commercial thing
We had to provide all of our own art supplies, but with our student ID from there we got a discount in some art supply stores
>In my university (in Scotland) the code/programs we write belong to the student not the university,
I assume you are talking about undergrads/not employed
I haven't seen a university yet where research output from employees (includes PhD students) does not belong to the university
> your university is not even aware of their true legal power, they could claim 100% without even passing a new regulation
Very common in academic research but not so much in terms of copyright, universities rarely care about that, but about intellectual property (patents, licensing,...)
However, (undergraduate) students are often not employed, so there are also no work hours
have something similar, but not on the beginning of spring but instead in summer near the end of the school year, after the grading period has finished and there's just a few days left before the holidays
Well today spring skipped the day around Vienna and Winter said:"Nah, I'm not done with you yet, here have below zero temperatures and some snow".
ooh that's a good one, we observe that here as well
yeah and still people skip classes near the end of the school year
don't make this a bigger thing than it is
If you count neighbors as the guys to left and right of you:
The first neighbor is my cousin, the second one organized me a job that i needed to finish school and his wife is related to the wife of my cousine (the one on the other side)
If you call everyone near your house your neighbore:
There are another 3 cousines living on the same street the brother of the one neighbore is living next to the first cousin i mentioned, the son of that guy is also living directly next to him, opposite of my place lives the woman that was my babysitter when i was small, then there is a good friend living next to them
I would say my street is really really close
It's funny if someone from my family celebrates his birthday because everyone is celebrating twice, one time with the family and one time with the street so you celebrate them twice with them in case of the ones living in my street

All of my neighbours spy on each other but are not covert about it
We are all living in a small village so things like this are really common, basicly most of my family lives nearby with the exception of 2 living in vienna, 1 living on the czech border and 1 living in poland
There is even a joke that if you are not related to me or my neighbor you don't belong into the village since 80% of the village is related to at least one of these families somehow (but many are related like: my grandmothers cousin married the brother of the wife of his grandfather)
(The village has 300 people)
The reason why many live so extremly close and not more spread out over the village is because the area was farmland and owned by my family, after my grandfather died my uncle decided to not continue the farm so everyone in the family old enough just got a piece od land, under this people where my father and a few cousines

45-60 min bus ride, then a few stops with tram, then a few stops with bus
Commute was about 1 hour in the morning and about 1,5 hours in the evening
Currently unemployed so I hope the public transport connection is better at my future job, because it was a fucking nightmare
Either about 12 minutes by metro or half an hour by tram, I prefer the latter if it gets really crowded on the metro
I don't need to switch lines on any of them so that's super convenient, but I need to walk much more for reaching the tram (which doesn't bother me much, at least not in summer)
20 minute tram and metro ride
5 minute walk, 10 minute bus
About an hour
15mins on the bus and then 35mins on the train (alternatively: 35mins in 2 Metros) finished by a 10min walk
Add waiting
Or: listening through my 2 favourite records for commuting to and from work
~4 minutes walking to the tramway station
~15-20 minutes sitting in the tramway, reading a book, the newspaper, browsing reddit or watching random people
~1-2 minutes walking to university (essentially I have to cross a rather big intersection
The 2 minutes include waiting at the red light)
et voila
Or I take the bike, which also takes around 15-25 minutes (depending on the wind, my motivation and my form)
One hour with country roads, primary roads, and city driving
I could also use a highway most of the way, but that's too risky
If something goes wrong there and there's a jam, it can take somewhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours
5 minutes by car or 25 minutes on foot - would be 10 minutes by bike, but the hill at the end is a problem, and I have to cross a wide, busy street at rush hour
Walk to the subway/tube, ride 2 stations, exit, walk 1 min, takes about 10 min total
Or i can take the bus, takes 10 min or walk 15 min
I walk down 4 floors, walk about a minute to the subway, have a 8-10 minute subway ride and then walk up 2 floors and I'm there
About 20 to 40 minutes by car, heavily dependant on traffic
Still better than 1,5 hrs by train and bus
Go across the street, get into my tram, exit my tram, cross a bridge, done
40 minutes by public transport including walking (mostly due to the early hours), 25 minute bike ride (or 20 if I'm really trying)
I like some parts of it, riding along a park and on the ([newly finished] "bike highways", they make you imagine what riding a bike in the Netherlands must be like: straight, spacious, little to no disruptions
other parts are still in more of a patchwork manner, require stopping at traffic lights and riding next to cars, etc, but overall I'm happy
most importantly, by bike the 15 minute walk from the tram station to the office at the end turns into a 4 minute bike ride, so that's great
also it's my exercise, I normally try to be fast and get my heart rate going
now only if I would have an office that offered on-premise showers and proper bike parking
oh and in winter, wearing high visibility clothing is important, have had a few close calls already
I have a foreign name and I really love it (it is also a great conversation starter with Bulgarians)
I actually really like the spanish version of Joachim, Joaquin
My second name is Wolfgang, glad to hear some people enjoy hearing it
My second name is Friedrich, nice to see someone who's not making fun of it ;'}
And then there’s my family who named a child born in the 2000s not Wolfgang but Wolfram
Yeah that’s fitting
Imagine being a fucking high school kid named Wolfram
Early 20 I would say, but at rural areas old houses tended to build in mind with multiple generation living in it, so people safe rent and stay there
It varies
Some move out with 16 others with 25 and again others never
Are you sure stayed properly in the lineage etc
all the way to 2019

On another topic, you king seems to be one of the many people who call themselves "King of Jerusalem". The last Austrian emperor was another one
(And many others too)
Of course
The point I'm trying to make is, that many of such titles are basically just lies
One of his precedessor just started to call himself that, without any legitimacy
Napoleon lost 3, more or less, bigger battles
My family and I were visiting the Harry Potter studios near London and we wanted to take a picture in front of it so my dad went up up to a woman and asked her if she could take a picture for us
He was in the middle of asking her politely in english when she just answered in an Austrian dialect and we were all pretty surprised
I'll admit that the Harry Potter studio maybe isn't the most unusual place but it was still nice meeting someone in Great Britain who's also from Austria
Wait Sean Connery is the voice of Draco in the original
Holy fuck that was my favorite childhood movie, gotta rewatch it in English now

Same thing with Austria btw

I could be wrong but aren't Strigoi kind of like vampires
I can't not, also love the ballet scenes and the little historical tidbits, because many of them I don't know usually
Sure, breakfast + new years concert is the best start in a new year
I never did it, even though I like classical music
My mind is just not up for it on New Year's Day
We always listen to it while having lunch
I am currently lying on the couch waiting for the Radetzky March
I love it
I'm in Salzburg today for the Salzburg Philharmonic Orchestra, so no viennese concert for me :)
Of course I did, no New Year without the Neujahrskonzert
If you wake up on the 1st and it's not already over, you know you're getting old :D
Enter the lottery for seats next year before february - cheapest tickets start for 20€.
Btw, I much prefer watching this concert on tv - relaxed, while having breakfast
If you are interested in hearing a concert in that same concert hall, there are many more opportunities - at more convenient times
For exaple I once attended the final exam for conduction students there - free entery and fun to watch
You can have breakfast on Jan 1st
I'm usually much too hungover ...

**proper** bread
sweet dishes as the main dish
dishes containing poppy seeds
having three or four beers over the evening and thinking that's not really drinking, apparently
I do ...
popular here as a "healthy" food option, together with all types of more exotic grains (spelt, einkorn, amaranth, etc)
Legal drinking age for non-distilled beverages being 16 as well
I went on vacation near Pula in Croatia with friends from Romania
Didn't know how many opportunities for dick jokes there are if you're really dedicated, what a week
Topfen ️
calling the DACH region to report in: /r/de
no but seriously, proper bread seems to be one of the things you can only get here
This happens to me way too often
Hell no, that would be ... weird
It's was once called "Heiden" and had a tradition as poor man's food
Heidensterz for soup is on of the last still cooked dishes
Seeing spelt as exotic is a bit a hyperole, you can get nearly everywhere and it's grown at 15000ha here, compared to Ameranth which is more often found in gardens as ornamental plant (Fuchsschwanz)
so that's what it's called there
really popular in Austria, we have that instead of baked beans quite a lot
sauce is way better as well
hard agree; and have a cutoff date at around 70
heck make little 4-question quizzes on general knowledge about politics before a vote mandatory, with the amount of points gained influencing the weight of your vote

solely done because they try hard to adapt to your greeting style, but are weirded out hard by it because they've not hugged anyone except their partner since they were 10 years old

ooh yes, wouldn't know what to do without Topfen
certainly not have Topfenkolatschen, that's for sure
we don't see it as cheese here, more like its own thing among milk products, like cream or yoghurt
We have the same
It's just called Apfelsaft g'spritzt
i have family in drenthe and snackbar is the only term for it i know
yeah I should've put exotic in quotation marks; meant to say that lots of grains are sold under an umbrella term of being organic/natural/healthy/traditional/original
the sauce they're in is weirdly sweet
the packaging in cans makes them feel like an artificially-flavored "unhealthy food". if there's sausages in them, they're the soft, canned, sad kind
they're a weird choice for breakfast when you're used to muesli with milk
finally, because when we're in the mood for white beans in sauce, we normally have [Serbian Bean Soup] instead, which is basically the same but differently flavored (with paprika and spicy)
schorle has to be my least favourite german german word
I know - and I really dont like it
>Apfelsaft
Süßmost tho
I loved it
And then
I drank too much of it and now it disgusts me
But I still love sparkling water

I might be very mainstream with choice but Sacher Torte is my absolute favorite
The Original Sacher-Torte is probably the most famous cake of all time and the result of several lucky coincidences
In 1832 the Austrian State Chancellor, Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, was expecting guests and instructing his kitchen staff to create a special dessert for the occasion
On the day of the event, however, the cook was sick and so the tricky task of conjuring up “the dessert of the evening” fell on the 16-year-old apprentice chef Franz Sacher
"That he doesn't shame me tonight
" Said Prince Metternich to the student on the way to the kitchen
Franz Sacher knew that this was a unique opportunity for him and thus created the icon of all desserts: The Original Sacher Torte
This must have tasted excellent, because from that day the cake was considered “presentable at court” and was regularly on the menu of the imperial court

For me that would be the "Kardinalschnitte".
Zabaione, panna cotta, Pandoro, ...
That Beethoven was austrian
He was german
That Austria-Hungary was doomed to fail
It wasn't and the whole narrative came about in the 20s when all new nations had to justify their own existence
That Austria started WW2
All the way since Jan Hus
Never really got the whole Beethoven situation, never heard anybody call him austrian

This is the real "common misconception"here: Austria never attempted to convince the world of either
Indeed, but he was german
American and british strategic bombardement caused a lot less damage then the allies anticapated
Most german military and civilian industries were still intact towards the end of the war
Rather have no humour than shit humor, like Slovaks apparently
In Austria we have the Stefanibock, a strong beer brewed in honor of St
Stephen's feast day on December 26th
Yes, Weihnachtsbock
It's not all that famous though compared to Glühwein
Yes, Samichlaus from Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg
Only brewed on the 6th of December and then stored for 10 months before it's sold
With its 14% it's AFAIK one of the strongest lagers in the world
Yes, we do, and at Easter as well: Weihnachtsbock und Osterbock
It's stronger than usual
Not for Christmas, specifically (someone will correct me)
We actually do, it's called Weihnachtsbock
I'm sure some breweries something like this, but it's not a broad tradition
Glühmet and Glühcider as well
But it won't overtake Glühwein anytime soon
Not trying to hinder your search, but it might also be a British thing
Honestly cannot remember where I had it
It was nice though
Some people use it, either in original form or pellets, but for most people wood stoves are a nice extra they put into their living rooms for that extra cozyness in winter
In Austria it's pretty common in villages and farm houses
In rural places in Austria, yes
I have central heating with wood or oil
I usually use oil to heat up before I wake up in the morning and then start heating with wood when I come home from work
I also have a small tiled woodstove in the living room, but its not connected to the chimney at the moment
My neighbour has a 400 year old house with 4 masonry heaters
One huge tiled one for the big living room
One for the kitchen which is the cooking stove at the same time
One for the small living room and the hallway (its basically a woodstove and wall at the same time)
And a smaller stove for one of the upstairs bedrooms
Amazingly the house only has one chimney, despite the stoves being ~15m apart from each other
I will never fully understand how that old house works
My grandma has central heating with oil and a big woodstove that heats the livingroom, kitchen and dining room
She usually lets the oil run on really low heat and does most heating with the tiled woodstove
What
>A wood stove is not that enviromentally friendly
Burning wood is climate neutral
It's not a part of the greenhouse effect as long as new trees are replacing the ones that were cut
>but just burning wood without any filter can't be that good for mother nature
There are filters in reasonably modern stoves and as long as you don't burn wet wood there isn't a problem
>Fireplaces make a comeback currently, but they are just for heating one room
If built smartly you can heat 3-4 rooms with one stove
>I usually help my father chop wood in the spring, then it dries over the summer and is used mostly in the winter
You burn the wood you chopped in the same year
You should store coniferous wood at least 12 months
Hardwood you should store 2-3 years before burning
In your climate you might even have to store it longer than here
Burning wood after storing it for such a short time makes it really ineffecient, you are burning much more wood for less heat
It also drastically increases the amount of toxic stuff thats being released
Furthermore it ruins your chimney
You mean ... a [Kachelofen]
Your Kachelofen has no Kacheln dude
>Yeah, but most people just use it to heat a room
Depends
In rural places were people actually use woodstoves for more than looks, they are arrangend more thoughtfully
In all of the houses in my area I know, there is just one woodstove that only heats one room
And thats the stove for heating and cooking at the same time
Most we learned about the Austrian Empire was in context of how various Habsburg monarchs affected Austria itself
Overall I think there wasn't put that much importance on it
In contrast to the Nazis, WW2 and the holocaust, I remember it being very factual and without any politicizing (not that I am necessarily against that, Nazism is rightfully condemned in our schools)
Personally, while I wouldn't say the Austrian Empire (and later Austria-Hungary) was a force of good, it definitely wasn't evil as it is sometimes portrayed
For a multi-ethnic, absolutist monarchy, it was pretty tolerant and peaceful, and towards the later years there was increasing equality among the peoples
I think it was a fascinating country with a unique overarching culture that is now lost forever
And I like to believe under certain circumstances and with enough reforms, it could have survived and even thrived, possibly to the present day
Most of the crown lands weren't too happy with the representation and being ruled by a country whose language they didn't even speak but in comparison with how the Belgians ruled in the Congo or things like that, we weren't that bad
Was a bit more ambiguous than that with plenty of groups being really invested in the Empire and its system
The only groups that reeeeaaaly were pissed and wanted out no matter what were the Italians and Romanians
Ahh yes and nothing ever happened to the Armenians;)
Spreading FREEDOM^(TM) with military - always a great excuse
when i was in krakow poland I heard that back when Poland was Split up between germany, russia and austria the Part that was in Austria-Hungary had the most luck relatively
Austria built beautiful theaters and did not push the german language through them
The polish theater showed polish stuff
This was not the case in the russian or german territory
On the other hand the Polish were some of the most invested subjects of the Emperor
Especially because Russia proved to be an everlooming hate figure
Did you miss the whole "hungary-being-so-unhappy-they-split-into-a-separate-kingdom-thing"?
Same day as napoleon even
Yeah but after that the desire for getting rid of the Habsburg subsided immensely
Generally it was more of a "I really really want some more autonomy like the Hungarians have" and less " A las barricadas"
It was to prove that they were better than Napoleon, with their mechanised Infantry and everything

Are you a weeb or did you google
That would be [Otto Clemens] although he is a narrator rather than a presenter
He's not that well-known by Name, but anyone who has ever seen a nature documentary ([UNIVERSUM] Terra Mater) on Austrian TV knows his voice
I wasn’t familiar with him, but now that you’re saying it, it does ring a bell
Nowadays documentaries are always foreign ones, thus subtitled, so no iconic voices that I’m aware of
And new Romanian documentaries are afaik nonexistant
>The most iconic would be, in my opinion, the guy who travels around and eats stuff, Jumbo Schreiner
His shows aren't documentaries
HC Strache
Exactly a year ago a video was published of him trying to sell contracts to a (fake) niece of a Russian oligarch, as well as trying to convince her to buy the "Kronen Zeitung", Austrias most popular newspaper
He also explains in detail how his party gets funding without the court of auditors knowing about it
This blew up our right-wing government, made him loose all his positions and income, and there's multiple investigations going on
(afaik, his house has been raided 3 times during the past year)
He's now trying to get back into politics by trying to become mayor of Vienna
Unsurprisingly, it's not working
The strangest thing is, I think he will still get a few percent of the votes in the Vienna election
And I'm not even sure if I should be that mad about it since that's going to cost his old far-right party some votes
I'm not sure he is the most hated nowadays, he is thankfully too irrelevant for that
And after all that, he still had the audacity to name his newly-founded party after himself
Don't forget Kickl
Okay but what about Rita Barbera
I know she's dead already, but I have never met anyone who actually liked her
Which is kinda baffling to me, [how can you NOT like a woman with such class]
Probably Bernd Höcke
Why are they hated
The only positive aspect of HC building a new party is that the FPÖ will lose some voters wich makes both parties pretty weak
He definetly is the most hated because somehow he still finds a way to feud with every otger public outlet or person
Not even his old mates at FPÖ wish him well anymore
I'd say he's the most hated
Everybody loves Kurz for some reason, only the left hates him, or at least doesn't like him, and everybody else is unknown and/or irrelevant
But *everybody* knows Strache
The left has hated him for *decades*. And even though he didn't really take any damage with his fans after the Ibiza scandal, the subsequent "Spesen" scandal of him misappropriating official party money (=tax money) and buying Gucci handbags for his wife from that money, and paying his rent with money from his political party etc
really made him hated among a significant portion of the right half of Austria too
Ironically that's not correct as Kurz got the most resistance from his own party
Some background on this: The ÖVP is traditionally a federal party where power is distributed over State Leaders, Chamber Leaders (all except Workers Chamber) and the Main party
Kurz throw these principles out of the window and disrupted the power balance among the states by making him the sole leader of the party
This is also the reason why he gets so much critique from the heads of states like Tyrol or Vorarlberg (except for his bootlicking friends in Styria and Upper Austria)
Also when he wanted to dissolve the chambers he earned a lot of resistance since most chambers are lead by the ÖVP
When the Kurz-Strache government announced to reduce the influence of the chambers I had to chuckle because I knew he had no real chance against the ÖVP leaders in the chambers
We also should not forget the resistance in the Ministry of Internal Affairs which has now a long black tradition and suddenly was colored blue
The reason why so many scandals leaked out were the ÖVP people fighting against Kickl
Last but not least we have the part of the ÖVP which does care for workers rights, because many people inside the ÖVP value the work of their clubs very high (Volunteer Fireman, Musik Clubs, Veteran Clubs etc
) and with the introduction about the "Flexible Worktime" a lot members of the ÖAAB resigned due to Kurz
The most gain got Kurz from people which went away from the FPÖ. True is he has a lot of followers also in the neo-liberal wing of the ÖVP, but he has many opponents in the conservative and left wings of the ÖVP
But those will vote for him anyway, because they never would vote the SPÖ, Green party or Neos
Of course it is
> But those will vote for him anyway, because they never would vote the SPÖ, Green party or Neos
Yeah that's the point though isn't it
Those people are opposed to him for various reasons, but they don't really *hate* him, which is the whole point of this thread
They depend on Kurz, and even if they oppose him, they like him the way a beaten dog likes his master, because he can bring them the votes they need to do as they please
To a degree no ÖVP-head has been able to do since the 1960s, or at least since Schüssel
> Esperanza Aguirre made sure nobody took her seriously while she consolidated her power
Ah the old "BoJo maneuver". Very clever
No there are a lot who really hate him, like many of the old party members who resigned or [this old lady] Nevertheless these people still vote, because they see it as the vote for the party not the person, and since they see all the opposition as even worse
There is a difference between hating a person and voting for a party
I give you an example from an acquaintance of me, who was part of the ÖVP for 30 years
He was denounced personally by a high functional several times within the party
When voting came his wife still voted for the functional, because she always voted black and she can't vote red
A similar thing holds for Victor Orban
Ö1 made a voters survey several years ago and checking how well perceived Orban really is
Result was that many don't like him at all, but the alternatives were communists and far right wingers, so most voted for him
Hating a person, and voting for the party is for many people a different thing
Some do, but no one should
How does it feel that Guiness is more cheaper here than In Éire

[Alfred Redl] I guess
also the members of the SA and NSDAP in the first Republic
Is someone who leaves and becomes chancellor in a neighboring country, then annexes his former country and gets rid of its name considered a traitor
Then Hitler
That guy who went to Germany and then invaded us
Hitler
Strache and Gudenus, you might know them from Ibiza
I think so, but I haven't seen it
Technical it was, Hitler gave chancellor Schuchnigg an Ultimatum how Austria should be hand over to Germany peacefully with more demands as they negotiated before, else they move the Wehrmacht to Austria
Schuchnigg gave in, but Hitler gave the command to move in anyway
This resulted in the famous "Gott schütze Österreich" Radio Speech and it was decided to don't resist Wehrmacht
But yeah many were happy about it
Our vice chancellor H.C. Strache was forced to step back, because a video of him in Ibiza was leaked, where he made some suspicious “deals” with a reporter disguised as an influential Russian woman
The leader of the party of "the small man" pretty much trying to sell our country to Russia for financial help during elections
Oh, no wait
The same guy using party funds to pay for his lifestyle while earning a fortune in his position anyway
Oh, no wait
The same guy's wife earning politician's money for her work as the "honorary" commissioner for animal rights within the party (and she managed his Facebook presence
Oh, no wait
The same guy trying to get manager positions for close party friends within the country's largest casino corporation in trade for new laws favoring the casino
Oh, no wait
The same guy's party constantly being tangled up in neo-nazi shenanigans

Oh, and people still vote for them, of course
Because they save us from the big, bad, immigrants
Ibiza Scandal
Are we doing Ibiza again
Something with Casinos
Honestly, I've lost count and overview of our current scandals
What
the
fuck
There must be people alive to explain this, right
Did they purposefully kill those children
More recently, another corruption scandal involving the same party and the national Casinos company surfaced and is pretty big news right now
Sounds like every right-wing party in the EU is in bed with Russia
I haven't heard anything about "large scale shootings" in Sweden, care to share a source
The Vengaboys even un-retired for a week and gave a concert in Austria as a result of this
what I still can't fathom after reading through many articles reporting on the details of their WhatsApp conversations (because of course, they, including a prospective candidate for finance minister, were all stupid enough to just talk about it openly on WhatsApp), what I still really can't understand though is: why did the FPÖ try so hard and against all opposition and better judgement, why did they try to install *that guy* as chairman of the board of the Casinos Austria
surely they must've had someone equally corrupt at hand who would've been a better fit
who is this guy and why did he deserve this strong lobbying push, and what did *he* do in return for the FPÖ?
Now that's comparing apples to oranges
I don't know if I'm ready to be this depressed on a wednesday morning

What i have heard from a croat who moved first to germany and then to austria (and speaks german really really well) he says that the austrian dialekt in vienna is more different to the way most north german speak then croatian to serbian, and holy fuck if viennese is allready more different then i am declaring austrian it's own language
(He basicly said, if austria and germany would be in the balkans we would not just make fun about each other but instead stab us till noone is moving just over the question if austrian is a different language or a dialekt)
Viennese don't know "dem land tirol die treue" (loyality to the state of tyrol, or something like that, it's hard to translate)
In lower austria (which is basicly next door to vienna, it even surrounds it) thats basicly the austrian equivalent to country roads
(It's of course well known in most of austria and even  in parts of bavaria but espessially lower austria is crazy about it)
In super rural areas people will greet you as they walk past you - It always takes me by surprise :D
First time I heard of this song
Yes, am Viennese
I was born in Vienna, and I know this song
Well, uhh
my father is from Tyrol though
Never heard this either
the fact that catholics are more "fun" (and probably progressive) than protestants always amazes me about the netherlands
it's kinda the opposite in austria
German/Austrian beer is generally better than Belgian beer and the stuff they call beer in the US
Why
It is refered to as the inofficial anthem of tyrol but it is not the state anthem
It's a marsch/volkslied played basicly everywhere where marsch and volkslieder are played
It even run in discos on countryside festivals and theres no other marsch who achieved to be played in discos on a regular base
It is even played on the münchner octoberfest and i heard it in a linzer disco so it isn't just the countryside that knows it
It also made the news some years ago because some italian said it is a ride-wing-propaganda-song
(because of the second verse which starts with:
"ein harter kampf hat dich in zwei geschlagen, von dir gerissen wurde südtirol" )
(a hard fight has slain you in two, south tyrol was taken from you)
yeah
I only came across that song by coincidence like two years ago
has zero importance in Upper Austria imo, so if what he/she says about lower austria is true, then that would be kind of a culture shock to me
I am from Upper Austria and heard that song many times at public events
Majority of people here know it
Craft beer is
also not good
I like Weißbier, helles and Pils
And beyond that I don’t drink anything made outside of Czechia/Bavaria/Austria
I do early don’t even think the other stuff tastes like beer
(And nothing beats Augustiner & Stigel as one other poster said)
Oh wow ... Thanks for the explanation
We're very spoiled with public transport where I live
What
It’s my preference
I don’t care what you or anyone else drinks, and I don’t have to because I’m not drinking it
Yeah, it’s not and that’s my opinion
Taste is absolutely subjective
Please don’t be so hostile, it’s nothing against you personally I just don’t like the taste of craft beer
You have to understand the beer making tradition of Bavaria pre dates your country and for some people this is the only source of national pride they are allowed to show (football/bread/beer/other gastronomy)
Imagine if everything you liked about the US could only be distilled and expressed through something like a food (Oreos for example because they are delicious)
Of course then, despite how you feel about your current politics you fight tooth and nail to prove that America has the best dried cookies, or whatever
I’m waiting for a train so I’m unable to perhaps express myself properly but I hope you understand what I’m saying, for us it’s more than just beer
Also, it tastes amazing and is the best
In Austria  it's "Ministry of defense" (Bundesministerium für Landesverteidigung)
It used to be ministry of war back during the k.u.k. times though
Also "ministry of the countries defense". Makes sense since we're neutral and don't do offense
We had that too for some years
Well, it kinda makes sense
If we actually need to use our tanks to defend ourselves anytime soon then there are two options:
The EU has collapsed and our economy is fucked
Our neighbors have been overrun
In either situation there isn't much we could realistically achieve anyways
At least with a focus on cyber and disasters we can actually make a difference
Though I do agree that it is kind of ridiculous, they could be saving money elsewhere
I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t eat meat
Skiing is the devil and mountains are meh
I don't do cocaine in Ibiza :(
I'm not a big fan of mountains and I regard skiing as incredibly boring
So far there is nobody who enjoys Schnitzel with sauce
Good
How do I "activate" the flag thing
I can't ski (probably
I never tried, could be a natural talent but the world will never know
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ )
I'm not a big skier and normal Schnitzels aren't that good (Surschnitzel on the other hand
Oida
Don't overreact O.o (Ps
you forgot the coffee ;))
Heresy
You have 5 days to leave the country
Does it actually matter in Hungary though
It'd be the only central European country to take it seriously
I literally would in a heartbeat
I’m leaving Austria for much flatter places in a few years as soon as it becomes financially smart for us
That's only Vienna and some other bigger cities
In rural areas there's no way you get something vegan at a restaurant that's not just lettuce or potatoes
Oh yeah, coffee is gross too lol
Cheers mate !
The "Russian solution" for when a solution isn't beautiful, but works
Pretty fitting, if you ask me
Plus most of the other things from German-speaking countries mentioned here
In Austria:
To take a French shower (wearing perfume instead of actually washing yourself)
Polnischer Abgang (to leave like a Pole - leaving without saying goodbye)
Rather self-explanatory, but if something is in "Djibouti", the thing or person referred to is very far away
Oh, here something very Austrian/Bavarian:
# "KRUZITÜRKN
A combination of "Kuruzen" (a group of insurgents in the Hungarian kingdom) and "Türken" (Turks)
It's an expression of disbelief and frustration/anger
I guess it stems from wars with the Kuruzen and Osmans
"Do a polish one
" - Not paying at a restaurant
That's a good one
Heute gestohlen, morgen in Polen
I vaguely remember them using this saying in an advertisement
(English translation at the bottom)
Ma soit gfölligst stoiz aufm dialegt se
Da tirola dialekt moc t and tirola zum tirola, da steirische an steira zum steira, da fränkische an fronkn zum fronkn,...
Wonsdt den dialegt nima lawast don legst an däu fon dena cultua ob und wiasd zum stinknoamalen preisn wie jeda ondre
Everyone should be proud of his dialekt, the tyrolian dialekt makes a tyrolean a tyrolian, the styrian a styrian to a styrian, the franconian a franconian to a franconian,...
If you don't use your dialekt you don't use part of your culture and you are going to be just another prussian (north german) like everyone else
Austria too
That whole "stranger danger" is mostly media induced mass hysteria
There seems to be a nude/none-nude border towards Italy: I have been in a spa in a northitalian skiing area - there you could differentiate the austrian and swiss tourists from the italian ones easily by seeing who was naked and who wore their swimming-cloth in the saunas
I hob koa schimma wohea dea dialegt kumt owa dea is supa
Can i insult you and say that dutch is basicly a german dialekt
The first time i talked to dutch people (it was on the tyrol-salzburg border during my holiday 5 years ago or so) i thought that they spoke some north german dialekt and they don't understand my dialekt
So i started talking with them in english (i don't like high german because i swap to dialekt within one sentence, so it is easier for me to use english in such situation, nowadays i am better at speaking high german over an extended period of time but back then it was almost impossible for me) while they kept talking dutch and it worked really well
I needed half a hour to realize they were dutch and i only noticed because they asked me why i understand dutch but aren't speaking it
If you asked me how that even started, i asked if i can  play table tennis with them and they said to each other: "wat wil hij van ons
" Which is really similar to the german: "was will er von uns" Which i understood so i repeated in english and we just kept on talking like this
(The version in my dialekt: "wos wüdan vo us
" Is even more of from the high german version then dutch so you can't blame me from thinking it was german)
And yes i started to speak and learn dutch a year ago so now i could even apeak with then in dutch (at least to some degree)
Pretty much every lowsider will land you on your knees first
Unless you are extremely slow to react
["Das Fest des Huhnes" ("the feast of the chicken")] is a very good analysis of Austrian habits, especially for rural regions
It is mainly about way of life, traditions and rituals
(/s)
For Austrian history Hugo Portisch (a recently deceased journalist) made a very good summary of Austrian history in the 20th century)
"Österreich I+II" is more or less the standard documentary for Austrian students to watch when learning about the 20th century
Unfortunately I couldn't find a free link to watch it
(and I'm not sure if it's available in English)
I saw the 6 DVD Box of Österreich 1 for 30€ at Thalia ,recently, I didn't hesitate
I don't think it's available for streaming anywhere
Afaik there are some Episodes of it at YouTube, but Not all
[Edit: yeah, one of the later ones]
Österreich I alone has already 12 episode á ~90 minutes
To get a feeling of how it is [here's the episode 7 on YouTube] It's about the Anschluss
Sadly there's no subtitles and sadly the other episodes are not online
There is Schuachblattln
And then there is this drinking sport where people stand around a tree trunk trying to nail nails into it while getting drunk (någln) for reference:
„Schappen“
On 28th December in Carinthia (Austria) kids go around the village and strike older people with rods while saying a magic spell that rhymes and should keep the old people healthy
The kids are then paid by the people they have hit
In Austria we have "Fasnacht" which is basically a carnival held every 4-5 years from November to February
Every town and village has its own tradition
The main goal is getting extremely drunk (like every austrian tradition) and people are organised in groups with different nonsensical themes (like Bears, Guys wearing women clothes etc)
But the weirdest part of it by far has to be the musician group
It basically consists if the local traditional band and one day in February they take a goat to every restaurant, hotel and bar in town
They stay there and get everything for free until the goat shits on the floor for good luck
Then they move on to the next bar
Is this an authentic [video]
Can‘t believe it
Nagln is fun though, although I am terribly bad at it
Every time I think I have heard the weirdest thing about Austria, I learn something new that’s way weirder
Absolutely
I love to see how people get better the drunker they are
Oh my fucking god, yes
That is probably the most random thing we do
I feel incredibly bad about myself right now and will chastise myself for it
Will you ever be able to forgive me
I will have you know that Tampern/Schellenschlagen whatever else they call it is WAY weirder and also the worst lol
What about that time of year when when a bunch of people get together to dress up as monsters, set fire to stuff, and hit girls with sticks while Saint Nick's handing out presents in the background
Hot take: Bernd das Brot was peak millenial humour before being a "millenial" was a thing
Who here is old enough to remember when kika would turn into arte after the Sandmann came on
I predate Bernd das Brot haha
I actually never did that
But as kids we would walk from house to house on Christmas Eve with incense and receive candy and sometimes some Schilling, if that counts
My American wife straight up thought I was making that shit up until she moved here
I wish I had made it up, it’s awful
yup, my grandmother is dutch and it took me a few years to realize that having these calendars isn't normal in austria
In Austria as well
Hitler
Y'all already know
Luther was an anti-judaist not an anti-semite
And even for the standards of his time a rabid one
That Charlie Chaplin impersonator
Well technically correct, he did acquire German citizenship later in life
Good boy, bad hitler
Limiting access to art schools
Austria: 1938 Supporting Nazi-Germany to take over Austria country in the hope to have a better life
(Ok, the chance to fight them back was null so giving in was reasonable, but there should have been no enthusiasm about it)
If you're writing this from an Austrian POV, I think it was actually brilliant
If you are writing it from Richard's view, it was preeeetty dumb
That's not really a dumb thing tough
At least in Civ the units get pushed out of the borders on declaration
**yes**
As far as I see it, they started
I mean
harbouring the killer of the heir apparent was kind of a dick move
Yeah, we got some sweet loot outta that, financing fancy new walls for Vienna and a few other cities and even founded an entire new city (Wiener Neustadt) with it
It was planned to send the little that was left over from it back to England so Leopold didn't get excommunicated but the english people sent to pick it up refused to take it for fear of getting robbed on the way home
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
IIRC, technically that money was never paid back
Let's see how the Brexit unfolds
If the English become desperate enough, they might come back to it
It *was* a shit ton of silver after all
You're absolutely right
It was about the conspirators, not about the assassin (and a few other things)
But in contrast to WW2, every major European nation wanted WW1
Germany was lobbying for the demands to be unfulfillable
Russia had growing aspirations in Eastern Europe and alongside the Black Sea, France wanted revenge for losing Alsace-Lorraine a few decades back, Britain had no bilateral obligation to join the war but did anyway, Italy wanted territorial growth itself
So that one is only partially on us I suppose
I might be biased but I like the Austrian plates most
I particulately like that we have our national flag as the outline of the numberplate and the clean design overall
[Example]
The first one or two letters indicate the district where the registered possessor resides
Then there is the heraldic emblem of the federal state the district belongs to
Firebrigade, Police etc
have their own heraldic emblems
Then there is a three to six-letter/number sequence
Usually it's three numbers and two letters
For normal districts
I think only very big cities deviate from that
[I also really like the Slovenian plates with the green outline] and the [Croatian plates which also use the national flag
] But I don't like the Croatian font as much
Ok, bit of a different topic, but I like to rant about this:
The Austrian plates are the ONLY standardized EU-Plates, that aren't the actual standard size
For some reason we thought it would be a good idea to add little strips of our national flag on the top and bottom, making the plate about 1cm higher than the standard
Learned it the hard way ordering standard size plate holders
I really like the "official" ones, like police, military and some government cars, that have the [coat of arms]
And obviously, the district and letters make great number plates, like [PE*NIS 20]
I like our [license plates for electric cars] even more
The green letters look great together with the red stripes
Don't bring up [white numbers/letters on a black background] It's still a sore point for us Austrians filled with nostalgia and not wanting to let go
With a little refresh, those could've been on par with Liechtenstein
Edit: Ooh
They're on that website you linked
Cool
>Liechtenstein
>In a nice reversal of the usual design theirs are white numbers on a black background
Agree
Looks awesome on black cars especially
They were really pretty :(
Fun history fact:
(sorry, only found a German link)
>It's still a sore point for us Austrians filled with nostalgia and not wanting to let go
I've never heard anyone express this opinion, not even very old people
Is this really a common sentiment
Also, I've seen about three cars with black plates in my life and all of them were extremely shabby
Yes
Also, I'm pretty sure German police has a few Porsches too
Oh wow that's even prettier than white on black
Not for young people, I may have really over exaggerated that - as one does
But back then it did cause quite the controversy, I think it was in the media for almost a year
Even Hundertwasser was played a role in that discussion
u/lila_liechtenstein posted this link that summarizes it quite well: [
Very interesting
I had no idea
It's like with currency since I never used the old one I can't be nostalgic for it but older people will still talk about it sometimes
Speaking of Hundertwasser, I recently learned that he was a monarchist
Wouldn't have taken him for a nostalgic type based on his art but I guess he was
I really like his license plate design
Minimum wage
I've never seen a Kfc in Austria
Same here
I think the only place I've ever seen air conditioning is in movies
[You are not alone]
If you cross the border as a single male person then it's very likely they will inspect you

Seriously though, check out the [Inuktitut writing system] It looks like what they use in the movies for extraterrestrial writing systems
Super cool
That is possible
Tell the Wikipedia people
No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky

It differs I’d say
I myself have a pretty old-style handwriting, like my grandfather has
He and I both make the capital Z with a line and the lowercase z without
But there are many people that don’t make a line at all
There isn’t really a standard handwriting here
Of course when we learn writing in elementary school, everyone at first follows the teacher’s example
But after that most people change their handwriting to their liking and comfortability
And combined with an 's' beforehand you get the [Eszett or 'ß']
Most people have one (or 2), but they are not used much
Not common, but also not too uncommon
very common, they're just your second(and third, etc) first name and can legally be used as such
rarely people use them all, I don't even have them in my passport (they are on my birth certificate though)
traditionally, names chosen were of older relatives (dad, grandma, etc), also common were certain Christian names (it's a Catholic country after all)
but contemporarily, the freedom is higher, and I actually like the system
it's a way of giving funky or interesting names to your kid without fucking up their future, because you were sensible enough to  name them "Stefan" before "Romulus Esteban Zapotek".
Yeah, it's pretty common if you ask me
Yes, and the most I know is someone with 6 middle names
Yeah but guys don't give your kids a second first name, right
same here
traditionally, names of older relatives or certain Christian names (Catholic country after all); contemporarily, a way of giving funky or  interesting names to your kid without fucking up their future because you were sensible enough to  name them "Stefan" before "Romulus Esteban Zapotek".
I was the only kid in my secondary school class who didn't have a middle name, but many of my friends would rsther die than reveal their middle name for some reason
First spending hours in the kitchen cooking an awsome breakfast for your kids and then being ok with them only taking a bite before they leave
That is actually an issue for american soldiers training in Germany
They tell them not to kick in the doors of the training buildings cause it will cause injuries to them
Wow funnily enough my mom trimmed me to stand on both feet bc standing on one foot is unhealthy or something
I think the reason why it looks childish is bc it looks so awkward
Like they use cuttery the first time
maybe your feet wouldn't smell as bad if you let them breath every once in a while ;)
That is probably the most American thing I've read in this thread so far
So it's meant sarcstically

Good - but why even put on screen then
Having kids just nimble on a slize of bread before taking off would save the production some work
Being a tourist in the US doesn't help at all in finding out how prevelant that behaviour is in real families (or just a movie trope)
You should have your ears checked
Well Aldi is a German supermarket after all
It's such an easy fix in my opinion
well fair enough, so do people in most countries that take off their shoes inside
but you don't wear the same shoes you wear outside when in your house, do you
So I know I'm late but you don't commute via car, or do you
Is the idea to stop somewhere on the way home from work to get dinner really such a strange concept
Ahhh- youtube ist not reality
I get something on the way home to eat at home and I have never seen hordes of people eating in parking lots in the US either
i have a keychainthing thats mostly formed like a coin, but then it has a rectangular piece - so i can insert it in the coin slot - get the cart free - and pull the keychainthing out
(i always put the cart back and on the chain - but its easier for me to have not fumble with something after putting it back or coins i have to put away - so i take the cart back on the chain and drive off without something (coins or else) to stuff somewhere
> Good morning is almost like saying "this is a good morning to spend with you," unless it's just a one off thing and then it's naturally "I wish you a good morning
Reminds me in this
>  "What do you mean
" he said
"Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on
we have those rather seldom - mostly the ones where my keychainthing works fine :)
(only a slot for the coin nothing to close) - downside for them is, sometimes coins pops out when taking the chain back in  - or are a little stuck and are harde to get out - so my keychainthing helps me with these a lot
The [University of Economics] in Vienna
The [inside of the library] looks like a spaceship
The whole [campus] looks really cool in my opinion
And the stations of Vienna's [U5 metro line] (as soon as they're done)
The [Unipark] of the University Salzburg is also pretty cool
But the best thing about it is probably [the view]  onto the fortress
The [Graz Museum of Modern Arts] is considered as a shining example
(I personally don't like it, though)
That library reminds me of the citadel in mass effect
I think the [BMW buildings] do stand out, whether you like them or not
Well, I don't really mind the barriers
Federation
> people in the UK are very uncomfortable with any further union
*angry Ulster noises*
What's that unit in "11 Mm"? I've never seen that abbreviation before
Yo, what about the ÖBB
They're pretty good and expanding over even more of Europe
Ah, okay
I was guessing it might be "megameter" but I'd never heard of that
Makes sense though
Thank you
... Empowered by the Germans
In the case of ÖBB/DB it's more that the DB is a factor that's dragging the performance down, rather than enabling the full potential
His trains also ran to special "camps"
I mean with [Sissi] we have already one
I‘d make them baroque and habsburgian kind of style, for obvious reasons
Aka just take Sissi/Princess Elisabeth but draw her in disney style and that‘s it
"Austrian" Royalty, they were yours first ;)
Imho all Adaptions other than the older Anime are already really lacking, I really don't want to know what Disney would do to Heidi
First you exported them to us then you didn't take em back
Thanks alot
[One "special" lion]
You know that in the Disney version, her sidekick would be a wheel of cheese
Anastasia was a Fox movie, not Disney
We have the movie poster in our office, and from afar it looks like it has a [big glowing penis] on it
It would be awesome to have a Disney movie with artwork inspired by the Ivan Bilibin illustrations of Russian folktales
It would feature a soundtrack with Elton John trying to yodel while singing the tragic ballad of Alm-Öhi
For sure, she was always more popular in Hungary
Happy to share with any of the former crown lands :)
Oh, didn't know it
Don't know what I should think about it
I mean the old movies are quite average, it's more nostalgia
Yeah Romy Schneider looks great in it
She was an Bavarian duchess, yeah, it's even the movie
I just had a horrible mental image of the movie soundtrack being an endless remix of the Nokia tune
Would watch movie about Princess Holger
Would probably be confused and intrigued
Is- is one of her names really Tanpon in French or is that a typo
She still needs a sidekick though
Maybe a [Lipizzaner] horse
They'd fit in with the Austro-Hungarian empire theme, and they already featured in an old Disney movie
And the real Sisi did love horse-riding
> The scenery is mostly Austrian
I have no idea why everybody keeps claiming that
Austria doesn't even have a coast, let alone a mountainous coast
Also the name Arendelle -> Arendal (Norway)
It depends on your definition
Disney Princess**** is an [actual franchise] after all, which is why Moana and Pocahontas get to be princesses even though they're not royalty, and why Elsa from *Frozen* actually isn't a Disney princess despite being a princess and in a Disney movie
She travelled a lot but [Gödöllő] was one of her favorite places
It would have to be a double-headed eagle to keep things Austro-Hungarian
I can see potential for comic relief there
But if we pick Sissi (Sisi) as a pincess, then a horse would make most sense as her animal sidekick
Sisi was an excellent and avid rider and even took lessons in circus horse riding
Pfff
Barely
As if that 800-inhabitants-town hadn't way too much tourism anyway
I wonder how they'd include her crippling depression, her ano-/ orthorexia and her out of control coke habit into a Disney movie
And the whole incest thing
I'm sure they'll do fine, and turn it into a suitably catchy song for the soundtrack too
There are so many - St
Stephan's Cathedral, Schönbrunn Castle, St
Charle's Church ... but the weirdest are probably the massive [Flak Towers] in Vienna
They give me the creeps everytime I see them
Being from Italy is like cheating when it comes to stuff like that
Looking forward to
Ours has an aquarium nowadays
The L-Tower in Arenbergpark is used as a shed by the Municipal Department 42 - Parks and Gardens
Yeah the one in Stiftskaserne, the partner of the Haus des Meeres one
AFAIK it's also an emergency bunker for the government in the case of an attack
Real estate agents, followed by journalists
Ordnungsamt
And teachers for some reason
Everybody has an opinion about teachers, but nobody wants to do it
I got nothing
The biggest scandal this year, the [Ibiza affair] which subsequently led to the dissolution of the government, was exceptional and a huge scandal and got exactly the international attention it deserved
Which means for a small country like Austria: 2-4 weeks of major attention by foreign German-speaking media, and 2-3 articles each in foreign-lanuage media
Can't really think of anything small that was blown out of proportion
Usually nothing happens much in Austria
It's worse when your family from other parts of the country tells you these "stories" about the city you live in
Even as a joke that's pretty *yikes* IMO
Probably stuff like "Germany is majority muslim already, No-go areas in German/Swedish cities, the numbers of rapes have rises because of dirty muslim" etc etc
You see this kind of shit regularly on reddit
I heard Bosnia has lots of Muslims nowadays
Damn immigrants ^/s
Bernie Sanders would fit in sorta well with the Social Democrats in Austria, and they're centre-left
Go on from there
The latter part is kinda funny coming from someone who's from the UK right now
But yes, I'm aware of what you're pointing out
That's why the Bernie analogy works pretty well - he's pretty representative for the left(est) wing in the Dems
Of course there's still people further left of him, but he's a pretty good ballpark in general
Europe in general has advanced in the left tech tree further than the US and it shows in the political landscape
I found myself sitting in the garden of my favourite neighbourhood restaurant with a glass of tap water, a spritzer and a schnitzel ... within an hour and a half of touching Austrian soil after four months abroad
Drinking beer while wearing Lederhosen I suppose
Klingt komisch, is aber so
Did you fall off a balcony or piss in someone's doorway
If not we're good ... I guess ;)
Bread, like dark bread, or bread rolls
Because we eat Schnitzelsemmeln on trips too

Dual citizenship is only allowed in some exceptions
I think that's good
One can not be a full worthy citizen of multiple countries
Citizenship comes with responsibilities and many can't even properly fulfill those responsibilities for one country, no matter two
I'd be in favor of lowering the requirements for getting our citizenship though, I think the monetary requirements and 10 years of residence make it too hard for many to go through with it
It's not very popular because of A) envy (why should someone get to have 2 citizenships and vote in 2 countries while I can't?) & B) right wing parties fear mongering that Turkish/Arabic citizens infiltrate the society and change the country into a caliphate or something like that
Personally I have no problems with it and find it pretty stupid
A close friend of mine is from Poland and has strong ties but at the same time after going to school abroad they studied in Austria and consider Vienna their home just as their childhood home in Poland
However the Austrian state makes them choose between the two countries
Now a lot of people see that justified, I personally don't. You wouldn't wanna choose between your two parents (given it's a happy family)
But it is what it is
With 2 EU citizenships their votes count twice when it come to people sitting in the European Council (which is more a theoretical issue, but still)
I would support it, if there is a way to mark one citizenship as your "main" one with some massively easier way to switch that one for one of the others you have, at least when it comes to other rights than pure travel
Evading citizen duties like military service and in some cases taxes while still being able to influence the life of people living in the country massively by voting in elections even though the outcome of these barely influences your own life is unfair
Especially if people that are residents here but are not citizens can not vote
Lastly it is a good test on how serious you actually are, similar to a marriage (which also often is considered quite singular in western societies)
Don't want to give up your current citizenship even if it wouldn't make much difference either way
Well, then why should you have both instead
Clearly you don't feel THAT connected to this place after all, just somewhat enough to also be willing to influence elections
>The USA, famously, doesn't care so you can just renounce your American citizenship and live in stateless bliss
The USA does care
If you don't pay thousands of dollars and wait months to go to the process of renouncing your citizenship you'll stay a citizen and will have to pay taxes
we had the first official case 1983 and in 1985 the "Aids care" was founded with the help of the ministry of health, which opened care centers in every state where you could get anonymous tests and info material
I remember much of sex ed and drug ed was focused on the danger of it and you should always were an condom and never share a needle
I can't remember being discussed a lot in public about it
French sounds soft and sexy, russian sounds strong
I love both languages and could listen to them for hours
My least favorite is portuguese
i don't know, it kinda sounds like a mixture of spanish and croatian
I don't like it
Edit: Oh, and i forgot scottish
I just love how it sounds, although it's a little bit weird
I love the sound of Italian, Portuguese (pure music), cheerful Russian, and angry French
Special mention goes to Basque, which sometimes has a certain German feel to it (because of the tz tx (tsch) and k sounds), but in the next moment sounds completely out of this world
Absolutely love it
I used to love the sound of Spanish, and I still do, but ever since I speak it fluently, the feel is different, because there's so many other things I can concetrate on other than the sound
Excuse me
Have you seen Goran Visnjic in "Santa Clarita Diet"? When he spoke serbian it sounded so damn badass that my panties flew off
German can sound badass if spoken by an angry man (i.e. Christoph Walz or Till Lindemann) but serbian always sounds badass and sexy, no matter who speaks
I think a lot of people like german because of Rammstein
Which part of Germany
I know, but in the show he was from Serbia, so i guess he spoke serbian
Yeah that's certainly different than Hochdeutsch haha :)
Well, i kinda liked it
It was a little bit gory, sometimes gross, but all in all entertaining
There are better shows, but it's ok
If you have nothing better to do, you can watch it
But i got incredibly angry when they made a huge cliffhanger at the end of season 3 and then decided to not make a 4th season
I hate when this happens
Belarus and Russia
I don't think Germany deserves all those Nazi jokes
We do
But they don't.

the latter)
As little kids, we sometimes got referred to as „kleine scheisserl“ (little shitlings)
And i kind of liked it
Literally: „Kluane“ –> „Kleine“ [Shorty, Tiny, Little One] in standard german
They still call me that
I‘m the youngest out of the family and have been the shortest for a long time, right now I‘m a little bit taller than my mom tho
My grandpa is from the southern state of Carinthia and he used to call me "Lota" which means "large man"
"Has", which means a rabbit or bunny
Even my uncles and aunts called me by that name
Not my parents but my grandma calls me "kara dana" which means dark/black bull in turkish because of my hair colour
She calls my bigger brother "sarı dana" (yellow bull) because his hair colour is blonde
Never heard anyone else nickname their grandsons or granddaughters like that, but i find it very sweet
Cant wait to visit them in the summer this year
I read Minjung as Mischung and was confused as to why your dad calls you an alcoholic drink (wine + mineral water/soda, I think it‘s called Weinschorle in Germany)
mies bruder
Haha mine was Merlin, which was our cat's name
What I can think of is that the "lein" in Fräulein or Kind-lein is used to belittle something, similar to "Chen"
Where in Austria do people call it Mischung instead of Spritzer
I didn‘t know that, that‘s actually very interesting
Yeah Mischung is traditionally often given out at (traditional) festivals or traditional wine taverns we call „Buschenschank“ (which doesn‘t exist in Germany, if you are interested you can google it)
The word „Schorle“ doesn‘t exist here, at all
Apfelsaft gspritzt eg would be Apfelschorle (Only Weinschorle is called Mischung (I have heard people call Johannisbeerschorle - does that exist
- Johannisbeermischung, but if you say Mischung and nothing else you specifically mean Weinschorle
Both exist
I‘m from Styria if that helps, but usually when I went around about anybody who works for stuff (????) that have Spritzer/Mischungen they‘re usually familiar with both names
I work in a Buschenschank and hear Mischung and Spritzer about equally as often per day, maybe Spritzer less, if not many people came around
I mean, why not
is your uncle fernando torres by any chance
Somehow I completely understand all of what you said and also see how you can differentiate between Muesli and Müsli in spoken language perfectly but at the same time I think this is nuts AND very interesting
Thanks a lot, I'd never heard Mischung before
Idk dude I don‘t drink alcohol, it‘s just kinda become a tradition or become our culture, I can‘t give you reasons as to why some old people who don‘t live anymore decided to do that
Maybe if another Austrian who does know sees this can answer you
For us it‘s both red and white wine
Red wine is more common with the „skinny old dude“ and sometimes older women, whereas white whine is more common overall
Interesting to know that in Germany it‘s only white wine tho
It’s ok for learning vocabulary and how to use it
Grammar is a big issue
I refreshed my French with it, and for that it was ok
But I knew the basic grammar from Highschool
A friend of mine and I both started Spanish on Duolingo at the same time
I took Spanish classes in high school where we started off with grammar, so I've got a basic knowledge of that
And while I believe I might have an easier time understanding why a sentence in built in a certain way because of this, I don't think he's lagging behind all that much
From my limited experience I don't feel like doesn't help you at all
Concerning grammar, the thing is that if you learn Spanish from German, you don't get the tips you would get if you learned it from English
Tips are where the grammar is explained and it's just not available in German, for whatever reason
I took a brief look at the tips for the first few courses from English-Spanish and if they were available in German-Spanish too I don't think there would be much missing
There's also a forum where people can ask questions, but it's not available inside the mobile app
But, of course, you're not gonna become a C2 in a language from using a FREE app
If you master a course though I'm sure you could find your way around on a holiday
Sauce on schnitzel
Here it's not commercials *for* gambling, since those would be illegal
Instead they have commercials about what a great time people have at casinos, socializing, drinking and smiling
While I do agree that it should be illegal, I do also understand why there's more of a focus on female circumcision
There's a reason it's commonly called Female Genital Mutation instead of circumcision - it's far more horrible and aims to completely destroy the function of the genitals instead of cutting off a, let's be honest, pretty useless part
Finally
Jessas
The same is true for female genital mutilation though
To serve vienna schnitzel with fries is also really common
And i'm surprised that your wiener schnitzel is actually made out of veil'isch meat
If you order one in germany more often then not it is made out of pork (in austria you would then serve it under the name "schnitzel wiener art" (schnitzel the viennese way))
And my biggest problem is not with the sauce itself, you can eat your schnitzel with sauce but you do not poor it over the schnitzel like most do it
Just put it in a seperated part and just dip it
Why make a wonderful crispy schnitzel just to make a soggy mess out of it by pooring sauce over it
Did you really think we hate the germans for no reason
Incomparable to FGM
Not having it doesn't inhibit function though
What do you not understand about "I agree it should be illegal"?
All I'm saying is that it's not as much of a big deal when compared to FGM
Still barbaric
It's sadly more common than you think :/
Yes it does, the penis is less sensitive and sex doesn't feel as intense
There's a higher risk for inability to orgasm
I already said above that I agree it should be illegal
It's barbaric
I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me
Doesn't change the fact that FGM is far more horrible
So that's the reason Americans and Jews don't have sex eh
Yes, in some cases there's a problem, and that's bad, don't get me wrong
Again, I'm FOR banning it
Doesn't change the fact that it's not in any way comparable with what they do to women
Uh what
Who's hostile
There's lots of mythological creatures, but one that is on my mind occasionally is the [Håbergoaß] a humanoid goat-creature and with glowing eyes, that roams fields and forests at night and snatches little kids in the dark in order to eat them
Its bleat is so loud and terrible, it goes through marrow and bone
My aunt told me scary stories about it about it when I was 5 or so, which then I told my best friend, while I was sleeping at his place
We couldn't sleep until very late, and constantly looked out of the window to check if we could see the Hobagoaß somewhere in the dark
Scary shit
I'm a grown man now, but still, sometimes when I walk alone in the dark I still involuntarily imagine it waiting for me behind a tree or a corner
I think in my mind this archetypical figure is a representation of the primal fear of the dark and the uncertain
It's like it's burned into my brain
A few more noteworthy would in our folklore would be
* Perchten in general (the Habergoaſß is one of the Schiarch-Perchten)
* Die wilde Jagd (The wild hunt): Warriors which hunt ghosts over your head
* Lindwürmer (Wyvern): Klagenfurt has even a statue
* Krampus
* The Devil himself: We have a lot of places where it is said you can meet the devil at midnight
For example we have a stone which is said that the devil has dropped in our village
* Manderl: Small creatures which live in nature
Most famous would be the Wörthersee Manderl which created the Wörthersee by filling it with water from an infinite water bottle
don't worry, totally unthinkable here as well
it is not the whole world that lives in un-confucian anarchy
reverse TIL, the notion that somebody would find that "racist" really surprised me
it's a tradition, it's paint
what do people do when somebody dresses up as the Grinch, claim it's hurtful to The Hulk
that discussion is still unthinkable down in the Catholic south (we have a similar costume on Jan 6th), and I'm honestly glad, because I think it's mostly based on painfully ethnocentrically ignoring the context, and on forcefully implanting a discourse into a surrounding where it makes no sense
[highly relevant link]
I can just tell you about my personal experience from about 80% of the house parties I attended: The host fills his bath tub with water and puts in a "base" amount of alcohol, like two trays of beer (2x24 cans) and the leftover alcohol from the last party
Every guest would then bring something along with them as they arrive, be it beer in cans, bottles of wine or something like vodka/gin/schnaps
The alcohol gets put in the bathtub, stronger stuff would go in the freezer
There's a *mild* expectation that heavy drinkers would bring more alcohol, and people who are planning on staying more or less sober would bring only a bottle or so
Some people would skip out on bringing anything, but nobody's really checking that closely
Close friends of the host are expected to definitely chip in
Oh and depending on the party, alcohol debt can partially also be paid in food (something like noodle salad, cakes or hummus dips)
During the party, it's a free-for-all, everybody just drinks whatever they want or can find
This is like the majority of parties I attended worked here, the ramaining 20% only with the difference that the hosts didn't fill their bathtub, but the fridge instead
I sat under them at school (while being in the tropics, mind you) and hated them
Way too much wind, would always have a hurting neck/shoulders because of that afterwards
I actively looked for spots in non-airfanned corners
Neither proper AC nor ceiling fans are common here
Even greener
strawberry I know, but cherries is definitely new
Not every Austrian lives in the Alps

More like, for an adult native speaker no everyday word is really new
&#x200B;
But loanwords aside, "technical" jargon of any subject (be it biology or naval things or whatever) might be a problem
Sometimes it's clear, like a specific word for male animals is always "der", and for compound words it can be derived from the parts
But there are cases where we need to rely on a feeling/guess or don't know it at all
Pretty sure it's a German German thing, never heard this word before
Also, when I read your post title, I thought it was the parking lot somehow wandering about :D
We have parking lots at more frequented places, but in general if you want to go for a walk in the forest or in the mountains you can just leave your car on the side of the road
I do not know if its perfectly legal but if there is enough space such that traffic can pass by no one will complain, and everybody does it like this
Exactly
Also, "Die Wanderhure"... will never get this one out of my mind, unfortunately
And your username makes me hungry :D
Austrian TV hasn't had to a acquire anything new in 15 years
Every day, they show two episodes of Scrubs, followed by two eps of Malcolm in the Middle, followed by 2 How I Met your Mother, then 2 Big Bang Theory, 1 Simpsons, and now apparently they throw in a Young Sheldon and The Goldbergs
Sometimes they treat us to some episodes of The King of Queens or The Nanny
Oh, and in the morning they just show exactly the same things they broadcasted the previous afternoon
&#x200B;
EDIT: Another channel shows five episodes of Two and a Half Men a day, followed by three episodes of Navy CIS (that are then immediately repeated)
Yet another channel will show FIVE episodes of Criminal Minds in one go this evening, followed by repeats, which means TEN HOURS of Criminal Minds
That channel also shows Jane the Virgin between 4 and 5 am
Scrolling through the programmes I was impressed when I found them showing Black-Ish on a Saturday, as that's the newest series I found
Is Inspector Rex still running
German crime thrillers often aren't that bad
It's okay, I just watch a lot of Netflix instead
It‘s a reference to the show Trailer Park Boys
Nope
Its a Canadian show
Intetesting fact: the first known condoms were invented in Wales
They used the intestines of sheep (much the same way a sausage is encased in animal intestines)
It was the English who finally decided to take the intestines out of the sheep though
Well the Lederhosen and beer thing is true tho, we do have lederhosen and dirndl as traditional clothes, and the second highest beer consumption in the world, but the exaggeration of it annoys most people
Also I fond the complaining stereotype amusing becaise it's honestly true
Same here in Austria
> and most people in Spain are against it
So why is there no vote or something like that against it
You are not
What about the "everything tries to kill you" stereotype"?
> The stereotype I hate is foreigners thinking we’re all rich
I don't think people really think everyone in Switzerland is rich for Swiss circumstances but compared to what people make in other countries
Friends who moved to Switzerland make about double for a similar job
No it's definitely not an American thing
Lots of people from many different countries have told me that "Omg German sounds harsh". Then after hearing me speak it (e.g. with my mom on the phone) usually they were surprised
But I agree, probably Hitler has something to do with it
[Trevor Noah, whose father is Swiss, has a fun skit about that]
> I don’t care “who is receiving the action”
I imagine that can lead to some misunderstandings in bed
That stereotype was like 20 years ago at this point
Happens all over Europe these days
Good to hear
Yes of course
But that's kind of the point, everything is so much more expensive there so people have to be "rich", right
People simply (and wrongly
) ignore the difference in buying power and compare those values to their own income/cost of living
Idk what is in your English genes that makes you guys so resistant against cold temperatures :D My Friends from Birmingham brought a denim jacket as a coat when they visited Vienna in Winter ...
I'm hardly ever cold, but short sleeves without jacket
Around 16 to 18° Celsius, minimum
This reminds me of how the inhabitants of my village knew when there was an english boarding school on a ski trip: after they came home from skiing, hoards of teens would roam trough the streets wearing t-shirts and shorts
in February/March in an alpine valley mostly covered in snow
I’m from the Alps and my absolute comfort-temperature is 15-19°C.
If I‘m going jogging, 5°. If I‘m walking/sitting, 15°.
But are you familiar with us Waldviertler
I would personally, for myself, say 2°
Lol my Husband is a Waldviertler in fact
He always talks about the *Permafrostboden* up there
But he's always colder than I am
Its the year 230

Humanity is long gone
The squids who now roam the earth partake in an odd ritual where they swim from the temple of Londonoria to Brussalantis to ask for an Ex Ten Tion from the Old Ones
Nobody knows the origin of this ritual, but the prophecy says that the realm of Londonoria will fall to ruin if the ritual is missed even once
Archduke Johann is very popular in Styria for his investments in there
Andreas Hofer is popular in West Austria for his resistance against Bavaria and Napolean
Mozart is pretty popular, idk if you coun't that as hero
There are tons of war heroes from the Empire times which aren't really worshipped anymore, e.g. Radetzky and Tegethoff
more recent heroes could be: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hermann Maier, Andi Goldberger, Wayna Pawiasek ([what a gwoup]
Radetzky March
Enough said
Team Mira Lobe
>Wayna Pawiasek
UwU
He grew up in Prague at a time where it was considered mainly German town
He also spoke German almost exclusively throughout his career and resided in Vienna
If he's Czech he's a Austrogerman Czech
And his adolation also was mostly centered im Vienna
Ethnicities in the Empire, especially in the cities were just too mixed to portray them as one and one nationality alone
That is especially true for the nobility
Iirc he woke up but is still potato
I dont think thats something you recover fron
Problem is that we can't really speak about nationalities like you do before the middle of the 19th century when the concept was entrenched within the population
Being of the Czech nation in an age before narionalism meant very little - especially in the framework of the multiple personal unions of the Habsburgs
There was only the concept of the House of Austria which subsumed the population under the ruling dynasty
Radetzky was a member of a cosmopolitan class of people within the empire who are not easily classifiable
But the point remains that the center of his life was Austria proper and Vienna in particular
And if Mozart is German because hes a HRE citizen then so are all Bohemians and Moravians xD
But its fun talking about this
Nationalism and nationality before the spring of nations is a very fuzzy topic and also quite contentious and thus quite fascinating
No I did not refer to plans for German unification
Radetzky grew up in the 1770s - a time were the national genesis of most of central Europe was far from the spring of nations 80 years later
Which he by the way helped to put down enthusiastically
Look Radetzky throughout his life refused to define himself ethnically and only ever identified himself as a soldier of the Empire
He didnt care a bit about his childhood home and instead saw the Austrian army as his home
He was an army man through and through - in the end his maxim was: Legio Pater noster
My grandpa fought in WWII and was captured by the russians (as war prisoner), and came back after the war
My other grandpa was conscripted just months before the end of WWII and could go practically go home right after being called in
My Grandfather fought in Stalingrad, got wounded six times before they sent him home
Interestingly enough, he was in the french foreign legion before he got drafted into the Wehrmacht
Other Grandfather was only 12 when the War ended, had to hold some russian Soldiers at gunpoint who tried to rape his sister though
My great grandfather fought in WW2 (idk where tho) and he got away from the front after he got shot where the heart is
Luckily for him he had his metallic box of tobacco right where he got shot so he stayed undamaged
I mean we lead a country that called itself holy ROMAN EMPIRE for one or two years
Non sugary food
The idea that all humans are equal no matter the race
Ha, I had an Santa Fe Superchief toy when I was a little kid so I fought US was the land of cool trains, the whole Western movies turning around trains and tracks didn't help to correct me
Some old songs should gave me a hint, "I'm the train called City of New Orleans, don't you know me, I'm your native son"...
*no matter the wallet
Lidl has the better meat selection though
I don't know, whenever I hear American political debates, everyone refers to Black people and White people and how they should be treated differently
This type of racial categorization is almost non-existent in Europe, at least in public discourse on television
Diesel
There are diesel locomotives all over Europe
>Why not usual gas, though
What
Why would anyone try to run a train with a gasoline motor since diesel was invented
Sweden still has diesel-electric locomotives in use as well
Range extender vehicles are somewhat similar in concept
Ever heard of mechanical efficiency
JuSt ShIfT gEaR lol
>I'm a mechanical engineer
A mechanical engineer who asked why trains aren't run by Otto engines
Just started your first year of your bachelor
>And if diesel is more energy dense, why don't we mainly use that in cars
Thats exactly what we do in Europe
more than half of new registered cars are Diesel
>I don't think scale is relevant, though
So whats your theory why pretty much every huge ship, electro-generators and trains are run with diesel
Or you know, like, maybe the highest effective efficiency of all combustion engines, low fuel costs, high energy density, good exhaust-emission behaviour and lack of high voltage electrical ignition system are some other compelling reasons

Fiaker (horse carriage) ride in Vienna
Just don't. Spend your money on food or museums instead
If you are in Vienna and you wanna go to a concert or the opera, don't by tickets from those guys running around dressed up like Mozart, in a baroque red jacket
They are usually next to the opera or next to St
Stephen's cathedral (tourist hot spots)
Those are not offical vendors, their tickets are not for the opera
It's usually a random orchestra in some random places (schools, rented gyms) playing those 2 Strauß pieces everybody knows, and that's it
For the low-tier experience that this is, you pay way too much
Last-minute opera tickets are available at the ticket office *in* the opera house at the left side entrance (you'll have to wait in line on time), and are quite cheap, other concert tickets at official vendors, usually at the respective houses, NEVER in the street
Also, don't take those horse carriages
They are really expensive and the horses barely have rights or good working conditions
If you really have to do a tour like that, take one of those electric cars in an old timey look, it's virtually the same, or take a hop-on-hop-off double-decker bus
Vienna:
City-Airport-Train - regular trains can be used fort like 1/5 of the price
Ring-Tram - see above
dudes in Mozart costumes selling concert tickets - mother of all scams, the concert is some random crap
legit concerts don't have their staff wear costumes
Wiener Wiesn - for some reason (aka money) Vienna decided to rip off Munichs Oktoberfest
the whole thing is tragic and its actually more expensive than the original in Germany
shame on everyone who goes there
double shame on the locals who go there
Plachutta, Figlmüller - two tourist trap restaurants who both claim to have the "best Schnitzel in town". if you fly into Vienna the arrival hall at the airport is plastered with advertisement from those two, which should make one think if they really are as authentic as they claim
any random restaurant will have quality Schnitzel
Cafe Sacher, Cafe Demel - I regularly see lines outside those two Cafes because they are so overrun by tourists who think they need to buy this one specific piece of cake because their travel guide told them to
first, Sachertorte is very dry and pretty shit
second, there is like a million cafes and bakeries everywhere, all of them offer amazing pastries
poor horses
No, Sachertorte is good, but you can get it everywhere
meh, its kind of boring and needs tons of cream as lube
the amount and variety of pastries and cakes are pretty much the best part of our cuisine by far, but for some reason this specific one gets basically all of the attention
I certainly wouldn't spend precious vacation time standing in line for it
Yes it does need a lot of cream, but it does taste good
Yes there are many good pastries and cakes here, but it is one of them
Yes it is stupid to stand in line for it, tourists should just get it somewhere else (you can get it in every café) if they want to try it
When it comes to universities
that you can get only jobs in the university if you are deep in somebody's ass
The two class system
If you fail to get into a Gymnasium after elementary school your life will change dramatically not only because you are in a objectively worst school but also bc your friend circle will be a lot different
Oh boy, my favorite topic lol
• The hours
Forcing 7 year olds to go to school in the afternoons is wild
Also, not even high school kids need to be in class after 4pm
It’s pretty impossible to learn anything after spending 8+ hours at school
• Teachers have way too much power
• Not enough time is spent on truly important things, instead we have art class, music class, PE and fucking RELIGION class
All things that should be completely optional after elementary school
(for example, if you can prove that you are part of a sports team etc
you should be able to drop the class at school)
• Unless you are middle of the road smart and middle of the road ambitious, you’re screwed
Having a hard time
So sorry, the system gives no fucks about you, go fail until you get sick of it and then go into a trade
You’re exceptionally gifted
Also sorry, here be bored for 12/13 years because there is no way to challenge you beyond the current curriculum
• Quality of schooling 100% depends on where you live and how good your teachers are
The curriculum is not truly enforced
There is no sort of quality control
Teachers can do the same shit for 20 years and people just go along with it, even if it’s complete bull
I could go on about this for HOURS
Our school system is built for mediocrity, awful for students with mental health issues or learning difficulties
There is no room for individuality or greatness, just like there is very little room for failure
And whether any of it was worth the struggle all hinges on ONE set of exams
If you’re not average and neurotypical, Austria‘s education system was not made for you
School until 19:00 O'Clock 4 times a week
We have a subject called "History and politics" but the politics part has been completely ignored
In the past five years that I've been attending my school, the teacher decided it would be more use to the students to know which pope lived in the 16th century rather than actually explaining politics to students who are reaching an age where they are allowed to vote for the first time amd have no clue who to vote for
It's not built around interests or skills, the people who can memorize stuff easier than others are good students, and a student who might be good at doing art and may not be as good at doing mathematics is considered a bad student just because art is not considered as important as mathematics
I've learned so much more about the English language through the internet than I ever will in my English class, my English teacher sometimes makes basic grammar mistakes and every lesson I'm just completely zoning out because everything my teacher is going to tell me, I already know
I'm just physically present but only because I have to, I don't think I've learned a single thing in those English lessons
We have to attend subjects that I am certain, we will never EVER think back to unless we are going in a very specific direction in our career
An example that fits me personally: Chemistry
I couldn't give two shits about chemistry, I am certain that I am never going to use it again but still I have to sit through all these boring ass classes, when I would much rather be doing something different that would actually help me pursue my dream career (that 100% will not have anything to do with chemistry)
This might be a thing at my school specifically, but some teachers just read entire pages of books and working sheets to their students
I just feel like they don't trust 18 year olds to be able to read
Plus, what do the students gain from the teacher just reading everything to them
I don't get it
The list goes on but I think this has been long enough
Edit: I forgot to mention that my English teacher talks to us in German most of the time
WHY THO
It is - but there are two different kinds of secondary school
Mittelschule and Gymnasium
One gives you the ability to go to university
The other doesn't ( only if you put in extra work and do a night-matura or go to a higher vocational school)
Not true at all
As long as you get into a high school and get a Matura of any sort, you can go to Uni, regardless of what you did from ages 10-14
HOWEVER, the education at a Neue Mittelschule is definitely not at the level of an average Gymnasium
i second this

The [Kruckenkreuz] symbol of the dictatorship 1933-1938
And no, it has nothing to do with the Nazis
However, the black white red is way cooler
The Arrow-cross is so ugly
It looks like the logo of a medium sized regional shipping company, owned by a guy named Laszlo
There actually is A LOT of austrian history in the interwar period that is often forgotten because of WW2
I mean, we had to figure out how to do this republic thing and voting, we had a very struggling economy, socialism started to take root in Vienna, we had a civil war, we had a fascist dictatorship
Even here, many people don't know very much about all that
No, not at all
That's what they're called
They tried to imitate Mussolini, the OG fascist
The ruling party in fact was very strongly anti-nazi
Many of them were put in concentration camps after the Anschluss
They were fascists trying to imitate Mussolini and not much better than the Nazis, but had nothing to do with the Nazis
I like it
It looks much better than the Dutch flag
It's a really fascinating time in our history, to be honest
The Schlossmuseum in Linz had a really cool exhibition about it until last year
There is so much we either don't learn or that gets glossed over
> Seriously people I'm just a fan of /r/vexillology, not a nazi
FYI those two things do not necessarily exclude one another
>  The St George's Cross in England generally either means a sporting event is on, like the World Cup, or the person flying it is quite right wing
*looks at flair*
Isn't Franco's grandson flying the fascist flag on his house
I remember seeing it on TV when they removed the body from the Valle de los Caidos
Yeah, exactly
What happened here between the wars had very little impact on the rest of the world, and it's easily overshadowed by 1938-1945
So of course it's not really taught elsewhere
I still think it's fascinating
I personally am quite interested in the [Red Vienna] period, how it came to be, what they accomplished and how it impacts our lives in Vienna until today
Fun fact: We still have the longest residential building in the world
The Karl Marx Hof, a prestigious municipal housing complex from that period
(The Wikipedia page for longest buildings is misleading, they measure around corners too)
Dollfuss was around 1,50 and got a nickname for that: millimetternich
"Bluatschilling" basically you sat down as a group and had to keep a coin spinning
If the coin stopped spinning or fell off the table, the last person that had to spin it had to put his knuckles on the table and got the coin flicked at his knuckle by each person in the group
We had a lot of bloody knuckles at that time
My friends and I still do that today lmao

The farther northwest you go the bigger the grievances
Might even bring them to court for continued verbal cruelty
And almost everybody else around us for using nuclear power and building plants close to our border
Only redeeming point about Germans that they decided to shut theirs down
But that really does not solve the cruel distortion of their pronounciation
Thats for taking Silesia and for what you are doing to our common language
Looking forward to the times when Austrian will be like a second Dutch language

I am a big supporter of minority rights regardless and wouldn’t mind a regional economical self-governance for the area which is overwhelmingly Hungarian, if that’s really what they want for the territory they live on
However, even now, they have every right imaginable for a minority
Schools in all stages solely in Hungarian, public institutions ranging from the town hall to courthouses, cultural associations, tv/radio/news, shops, etc
They can just go about their lives and not hear Romanian for weeks
The only right they don’t and can’t have is to live in Hungary right where they are
I'm a German living in Austria and I'm already on it
good idea - i mean we could do it but then no one north of the Danube would be able to pronounce it
Sounds like a deal to me
I know for a fact that a lot of Romanians in Transylvania that have to deal with Hungarians daily would be mostly ok with this
The ones that are the most vocal against autonomy are the people in Bucharest, who have never seen a Hungarian in flesh their whole lives, let alone visited Székely Land or know some real history apart from propaganda
Ähm I might be mistaken but I think there actually is something called ‚Austrian German‘, at least my dictionary says there is
[Mensch Ärger dich nicht] ist the local Pachisi game variant
Fuchs und Henne the local fox game variant
"Mühle" is Nine man's Morris
[DKT] has an interesting history
It's original name was Spekulation and is based like Monopoly on the landlords game
But it was renamed after the Anschluss because Monopoly was already banned for beeing to Jewish
They renamed it to "Das kaufmännische Talent"
"Leiterspiel" is the local snakes and Ladders, popular with kids
Speaking of a kids game, ["Tempo kleine Schnecke"] is not that old (from the 80's) but as it's easy to play every kindergarten and day care has it since then
Jassen
It's a game with cards
I forgot the last game existed until just now
Brought back some memories

I think our 2nd and 3rd biggest cities, Graz and Linz respectively, are generally more unknown than our 4th and 5th biggest, Salzburg and Innsbruck
I always say that Klagenfurt is our biggest city nobody knows about
Most people know our Top5 (by population): Vienna, Graz, Linz, Salzburg, Innsbruck
Klagenfurt is the 6th biggest and many people outside Austria have never heard of it
I don‘t know how well our federal state capitals are known, but maybe those
Idk how many people know about Linz, St
Pölten, Graz, Eisenstadt, Salzburg, Klagenfurt, (Lienz,) Innsbruck and Bregenz
I think Salzburg, Innsbruck and Linz are the more well known bunch of those
Pölten is also pretty well forgotten
Makes sense
Both Linz and Graz are quite uninteresting compared to Salzburg and Innsbruck
I was born and raised 5km from the Czech/Polish border (I'm Polish) and we made trips to Ostrava every other weekend to do some window-shopping
The city isn't breathtaking tbh (just like any other Silesian city), but it's quite a big one that everybody around here knows, because it's closer than Katowice and has almost as many shopping centres
Every Austrian who has a 24 hours nurse/caregiver knows about Kosice
Hey, I stayed shortly in Waterford last time I was in Ireland
Linz, Lienz, Liezen, take your pick
They often get confused with ech other
Lienz is barely a town to be fair
Yeah, they stripped it of its Schwarzenegger name back when he was governor and signed execution orders of death row inmates
I wish I could forget St
Pölten
Please teach me, foreigners
Pölten deserves to be forgotten
Pölten has a population of about 7
I mean most 10th biggest cities (especially of smaller European countries) are rather obscure
Of course, since you live right next to Carinthia/Koroška that doesn't really apply to you
Just like Hungarians probably have heard of Eisenstadt but our other neighbours haven't
These fuckers kill more people than guns, that's how delicious they are
Was born and grew up there, can confirm :( All there is is tourism and some industry, that's it
Ear plugs for the first hour whenever you take a train west from Vienna help somewhat
Austrians are in general quite bad at geography
Three towns in Germany
Berlin, Cologne, Munich
They should manage that
In Italy
After Rome and Lignano, they might remember Pisa or Bologna or Naples
For any other neighbouring country I'd say "no chance that a majority of Austrians can name three towns".
It could be Bucharest
Technicly all the answers here are wrong since the official name was never austria-hungary (in german: österreich-ungarn) but "the kingdoms and lands represented in the imperial council and the lands of the holy hungarian crown of st
Stephens" (but in hungarian and german)
But i can understand why everyone calls it austria-hungary
Österreich-Ungarn
What we getting taught in school: *Doppelmonarchie Österreich-Ungarn*
Not my native languages, but I thought I could add two interesting ones:
Indonesian: Kekaisaran Austria-Hongaria
Japanese: オーストリア＝ハンガリー帝国 (Ōsutoria-Hangarii teikoku)
"ungern" ist actually pretty funny
K.u.k. is an adjective/prefix applied to various things, not an informal name for the Country
I.e. K.u.k. Monarchie for the monarchy itself, or K.u.k. Hoflieferant for companies that were chosen to deliver to the royal court (which was a huge badge of honour and proof of quality)
So English is your language
&#x200B;
I'm pretty sure Österreich-Ungarn would be better here
There needs to be a hyphen: Österreich**-**Ungarn
He decided this name will be the official name in international relations
Thats far from an official name of the country itself
Most nation nowadays use there english name in foreign relations, that doesn't change the fact that the official name stays the one in the native language
I imagine tourists taking a walk on a sunny summer day when suddenly from the woods they hear yodeling: "What are you doing in my ALPS
Ungarn hungern ungern
He asked how the name of austria hungary is translated and technicly the name is the one i mentioned above (just in german and hungarian) so they have to translate the above
56% of our people voted for far right parties
When
And I would only call the FPÖ far right
The old ÖVP was right
The new one is far right
I disagree but respect your position
We agree on disagreeing
Constitution laws are changed all the time
They need 2/3rd of votes in parliament to add or alter a constitution law
For decades our big parties have added all kinds of irrelevant legislation to the consitution
In some cases they knew that what they wanted was probably unconstitutional so they added it directly to the constitution
The heart piece of our constitution has never been changed since 1920 afaik
I would say the changing of the B-VG for joining the EU would be considered a change of the "heart piece" as it was a so called "Gesamtänderung der Verfassung" in 1994 and therfore needed a referendum
> The heart piece of our constitution has never been changed since 1920 afaik
[Except for a significant amendment in 1929] which significantly weakened the role of the parliament
Another input from me: You might want to distinguish between the constitution itself (which mainly is the B-VG and the StGG 1867) and laws that have constitutional rank
(Gesetze im Verfassungsrang)
The last ones are simply laws that were pushed into constitutional rank by special quorum (and also by naming it to be in constitutional rank) but I wouldn´t consider them to be the "constitution" itself
So they were not "added" to the constitution technically, they were just "elevated" into constitutional rank to have special protection from being changed (and to make it impossible for the VfGH to overrule them)
Also the way the president gets elected

We love using this word to throw off foreigners
oachkatzl is the animal, but its tail is called oachkatzlschwoaf
In some alpine parts of Austria ( Bavaria I assume too) we call it "Oachkatzl". Oach is the dialekt word for Eiche, and Katzl means cat
Austro-Bavarian has some surprising similarites to English sometimes
Eiche -> Oach -> oak
That's fucked up
This has to do with Catalonia right
The first 3 points probably come down to their own history with Basque or Catalan independence

As an austrian, I don't put them in the fridge
Fridge
As with cheese and milk
In the fridge, both in stores and at home
I always put them in the fridge
In the supermarket I usually go to theyre in the fridge as well
I eat 7-8 eggs daily and my blood is fine
I don't use any oil and very little to non salt, sometimes cooked, sometimes scrambled
LDL in eggs is not linked with a higher LDL/HDL ratio and the ratio is what matters
I even read a study which also mentioned a 80-90 year old man who eats 25 eggs daily for most of his life and his cholesterol was normal
My LDL is 100 mg/dl and my HDL is 50 mg/dl
So a total of 150 which is very good and a ratio of 2:1 which is also good
Maybe you just ate other unhealthy food
1) if the smoking ban should be implemented or not (bring it on finally
2) if traditional winefarmer's eateries (Heurige) serve only cold cuts with table service (of course) or also hot food buffet-style (heresy)
3) in cities: if parking fees should be introduced and parking space managed/limited, or not (parking fees and city toll, bring it on baby
Whether the orange or green part of a Twinni (very popular popsicle) is better

In Austria, "I am from Austria" from Reinhard Fendrich
It always happens
That song made my heart skip beats when playing in the national stadium
I'm really spoiled with my countries location, I could go anywhere without being bothered by taking the train
The federal railway is planning to expand it's night train network further in the next couples of years and I'm very pleased with it
When traveling with train is either too expensive or it takes longer than a 24h day
When the trains don‘t go straight there (from an Austrian city)
Like how trains go directly from Vienna to Slovakia, but I highly doubt that there are trains going from any Austrian city to eg Norway without having to switch trains at least once
Or another explanation: Neighbouring states by train, anything else I‘d tell people to take a plane
Price and availability of overnight trains for longer distance stuff
Spending a whole day in a train can be nice, but it gets less and less exciting very fast if it essentially means that your 2 week holiday lasts only 12 days
From Vienna for example I would say the limit for trains is about Belgium in one trip
I'd take trains to about Luxembourg but probably not to Brussels (depending on connections etc
I guess some high speed routes could widen this to some degree, but I'm not sure if getting from Vienna to e.g. Lisbon for let's say ~200€ in current purchasing power in one night by train is realistic any time soon
Towards the south-east and Balkans the issue is rather with non-availability of trains (buses are king there)
Everything over 8 hours by train (or a lot of changing trains) I'll take the plane
Yes it is
>have the Swiss be in charge of it
Have the Austrians in charge
Extremely reliable and reasonably priced at the same time
It has a few different branches but it tends to be a center right approach to centrist approach with christian trade unions
At it's core is the concept of subsidiarity with selfresponsibility at it's core
And from there everyone has a responsibility for the common good, starting at the family, through the cocal community up to the state level and beyond
Where there is equality and solidarity on the left, there is responsibility for oneself and others in christian democracy
Sometimes this leads to very similar results, sometimes they are completly at odds
What do the movies misportray about your country
As strange as it may sound, austria isn't just one big mountain as some seem to think
And not everyone lives in a chalet and eats schnitzel or something like that every day
I'm told the sound of music is a crappy depiction of Austria, but I haven't seen it
Other movies don't really portrait us at all
(A standard Austrian chancellor appears in MI, but he could have been from anywhere
Lederhosen are generally not worn in everyday life
It’s the same in German - what pisses me of most is that they don’t even get the declensions and conjugations rights - it’s not “ja meine Herr die Auto ist da” it’s “ja mein Herr das Auto ist da” - I mean - I don’t expect a translator to go through every movie script but I am sure there are enough native german speakers in Hollywood that this can be solved with a simple phone call

Before Elementary school
My kids learned it between 3 and 4, they had those pedal less bikes before I guess those helped them with the balance
6-7 too, don't remember well
&#x200B;
Not driving people includes too young, too old, too fat, and/or (other) medical conditions
But other than that, I don't know anyone who can't.
I had a small pink Tom&Jerry bike
My older siblings had already learned how to ride on that bike, and I think the bike is still circulating somewhere in the extended family
First I rode it with side wheels, then by papa took them off one day and held me, until he didn't hold me anymore in one moment, and that's how I rode the bike
I think I was 4 or 5
Of course I also fell multiple times, but I don't have clear memories of that
I think nowadays it's more common that kids have those training bikes were they don't have to use pedals yet, but can learn how to hold the balance
Instead of side wheels
My 3 year old niece already can go around 10 meters on a regular bike because of that, it's very impressive
I think most people here can ride a bike and children are allowed to participate in traffic with 12 years, 10 years if they do a kind of "driving license". I remember I did that in school, a police officer came to school, we did a theoretical multiple choice test about traffic rules and certain traffic signs that are relevant for bike and foot traffic ("give way", "STOP" etc), and had a practical test (hand signs, looking for traffic correctly, taking a left turn etc
We had a "freshing up" of that theoretical knowlege with 11 and 12 years, also in school
Of course, cause that's how literally everybody ever learned how to ride a bike as a kid
1880s Austria as a city builder/tycoon game
The era was considered a golden one and the entire empire boomed
There is a game called Urban Empire that is at least partially set in the ere, however it was half-assed and abandoned by Kalypso

Ive only ever heard that one from my grandmother
„Tschusch“ in Austria
But a Tschusch can also be everyone else living in South Eastern Europe except of ex Yugoslavia, those people are called „Jugos“
Here in Austria its basically the same
Almost only about the nsdap, the holocaust and the Anschluss
We learned a little bit about the war, like the battle of France, operation Barbarossa etc
But almost nothing else about the Military factor
Same
HOLOCAUSTHOLOCAUSTHOLOCAUST for at least a whole year
You make it sound like that's a bad thing
Considering our current politics it probably should be taught even more extensively tbh
I'd say learning about our many attrocities is much more important than individual battles but alright
I'm pretty sure there are many FPÖ voters who wouldn't mind that, yes
Its not like they wouldn't do it
They just (currently) can't do it
Well we thoroughly learn about those as well obviously
We thoroughly learned about the events and reasons leading to that horrible shitshow as well obviously
The Austro-Hungarian Empire
I admit, access to the Adriatic sea would be pretty dope
Mostly 1934-1945 for the hardcore nationalists
Especially the period of 1938-1945
When it comes to less disgusting nationalists appreciating Austria and not the Ostmark its mostly the reign of Franz Joseph, and especially the Gründerzeit which gets romanticised
Chicken definitely is the most popular poultry meat, both in traditional cuisine as well as everyday cooking
Turkey is very common too, though people mostly just use the breast meat
Actual whole roasted turkey is very rare
Goose is mostly something for special occasions, for example [St Martin's Day] Duck is somewhat similar - unless you include Asian cuisine, then it's quite common since nearly every Chinese or Asian fusion restaurant and takeaway will offer some variety of crispy duck
As for the much more uncommon poultry options, there's quail or gamebirds such as pheasant and partridge
The meat is usually pricey though, so it's more of a gourmet food thing and not something for everyday cooking
And for the non-native option, we do have a bunch of ostrich farms in Austria, if you want to classify those as poultry
But this is also more of a fancy gourmet food thing
St Martins
We've got Martinigansl too :)
I never saw pidgeon around here either tbh
[Wels
] It's boring, ugly and insignificant
For some reason, this reminds me of the movie 'Yellow Submarine', during (or around) the time when *Eleanor Rigby* is played
Thank you
I was looking for the Austrian comment, fearing somebody would write something other than Wels
Wels is indeed a horrible horrible city
I hate it with a passion
Literally the only redeeming thing about it is that old tower, and that's it
I always say that every city has its bad districts while Wels as a whole is the bad district
I also like to say that Wels is like somebody would've cut out the bad parts of Linz and made it its own city
And like philzebub666 already said: Attnang Puchheim is the small version of Wels
I realize I apparently have a strong aversion against those two cities
Attnang-Puchheim is even worse in my opinion
>I also like to say that Wels is like somebody would've cut out the bad parts of Linz and made it its own city
As a Linzer, I gotta say that is an apt description
>I realize I apparently have a strong aversion against those two cities
You have every right
They are just terrible
That whole area along Traun and Ager, between Marchtrenk and Attnang-Puchheim is terrible
And Wels is the pinnacle of that area
I've been to Winterthur once, it wasn't that bad in my opinion
Pölten is also a strong contender
I've never been there but isn't St
Pölten only boring amd not ugly
I'm tyrolian and I feel like all the other Austrians like my accent as it is quite harsh and sounds a bit brutal, compared to the eastern Austrian dialects
People from northern and central Germany probably just see me as a peasant if I'd talk in dialect with them, as they won't understand anything
I would say that as soon as I arrive at the southern border of Munich, I have to speak standard german
Otherwise no one understands me
For sure
I get shit from other German speakers because of my dialect and from my international friends for my accent when speaking English
All in good spirits though
I sound a bit slow when I speak standard german
Its just because the harsher sounds of Hochdeutsch just don't lend themselves well to what my tongue is used to, and I have to on-the-fly translate some words and phrases that are not normally used in standard german
So, of course, this leads to Germans often making fun of it
I don't feel like they "mock" me, but occasionally my Southern Upper Austrian dialect comes through quite heavily so then I've got to tone it down a bit to be understood correctly
Recently was at a party in Berlin and they found my accent charming, so there's that

Ach Scheiße, hier gehen wir wieder
Why would you say that your dialekhkht sounds harsh-kh
Can confirm: am from "eastern Austria" and love the dialects in Tyrol
I wouldn't say that it's just because it sounds "brutal" though
That's one part maybe, but it's not the first thing that comes to mind when I hear it
I honestly don't ckhknow :D
If you rise the sea level by 900 meters austria would become a island group but still exist to 50% but 99% of germany would disapear
I see this as an absolut win
I think if the sea rises 900m we have bigger problems then a few germans moving to austria
Das/dass, seid/seit are mistakes easily made, but the only thing that drives me crazy are certain English grammatical rules invading the German language, like writing words apart and apostrophes
So the other day some people had a political discussion and someone came to the defense of a certain vice chancellor and he used the word "Bevölkerungs Austausch", more like "Gehirn Austausch", am I right
And you can very easily write German until the day you die and not use a single apostrophe ever, it is especially not used in the possessive form
Ever
That's the same as lie/lay and sit/set, isn't it
I think every Germanic language has them
yes, the good old *Idiotenapostroph*
Ah okay
Yeah, it's the same in German
I am in Engineering and my internships paid 1200-2000€ per month

If i compare it with something like law internships this is VERY good
Here in Austria you are part of the social system the first time you pay into it
For pensions I don't really know how it works, sorry
What are some funny movie translations from english into your native language, or vice versa
For example, in german the movie "Die Hard" is called "Stirb Langsam" which translates to "Die Slowly"
> Die Bart, die
doesn't really make any sense in German any more
Translating is Mega Hard you know
>"Despicable Me"
We just translated it into "i - Simply Incorrigible ", but ngl "I'm a little bastard" wins this
Well it can be a family activity if you really want
Many fans will never forgive Netflix for "Money Heist
" At least in German they translated it to "Haus des Geldes" which I can get on board with, even if it loses some of it with only being "house of money
Nice translation that is, in german it's "Das Schicksal ist ein mieser Verräter" which means "Fate is a lousy traitor"
Monty python and the holy grail: Ritter der Kokosnuss which translates to Knights of the coconut
Apparently we couldn't pun on "High Noon" either and just called it "Shang-High-Noon"
Yeah makes sense
ich is I in English
Thanks, changed it
Nope, never

Being hit with an ice hockey stick when exiting public transport, by some drunk youth, who couldn't wait until people are out before getting in

And small-scale fraud by a bank employee, lying to me about the conditions for some optional offer, to get me to sign it
(It was definitely malicious, not a honest mistake
And while that offer can be an advantage for customers, it's only under very specific conditions, and in my case only the bank would have profited from it)
Didn't sign it anways and switched banks soon after (and because many people were dissatisfied and leaving, this particular branch of the old bank closed 2 years after that)

Looking up and down my street at the moment and there are only two windows that aren't like these and that house looks like it will be torn down soon
While I don't try out any window I see, I know exactly one that is not like that - it was built in more than 70 years ago
So, I'd say very common here
Browsing some websites of companies gives the same impression, I don't see any single-direction ones
Ordering Windows that are not like that will probably be more expensive because they don't make it otherwise (if they accept such requests at all)
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Normal windows since the 80s
Currently living in France (> 1 year), it's possible to get them but they arn't popular
Instead people have horizontally opening windows and exterior shutters
I often wish we had up-down-slide-windows because installing and aftermarket AC is so much easier with them - and quite frankly, the summer in Vienna is so hot that you really start to need an AC to cool your flat down below 30° C
[We have to deal with abominations like this]
I would guess they are the norm since about 40-50 years, it is really rare to see any house without these (unless there's a good reason of course to not have them, like a sliding door)
I have never seen anything like it in Brazil
Just moved to Austria and found these windows very clever
How do you clean the leftmost and rightmost windows on the outside if that's in the first floor instead of on the ground floor
They must really hate those old windows
Haha those were awesome, I think I remember one where that lever actually shifted the window over in the frame instead of disengaging a bolt
But that must have been from the late 70s (i.e. was already old when I was a child in the 90s)
trucker Cassie is pretty cool

I will definitely do that
100% the norm, formal and informal
Yes it's pretty common and expected to shake hands when you meet
Depending on the social circle: very common even among friends
Although it should be added there's a range, it goes from the famed "shake everybody's hand once you arrive and don't forget anybody" to "oh we normally just wave in the general direction of people and hug our closest friends". I've noticed it is more common among younger people (<40) who grew up in Vienna and who might have picked up on Turkish customs in school (heavy conjecture); seems not to be as prevalent among younger people who moved to the capital for studying or work
Also Northerners tend to hug more than shake hands, I think
Traditional locals who grew up on the countryside are more reserved than all of that, they would often just nod or wave at people
Oh and all that is for up to the millennial generation, can't really say how it is among groups of older people (40+)
It's common for men and women
With close friends as well
Think of a normal handshake
I personally never do that, we always either use informal shakes (like half-high five or double-shake, I don't know whats the proper word) or do a half-hug
Or if it's a big group, just a nod or a wave
Cats, most people I know have had pet cats before so there's that
I like cats
I think Austria is pretty 50/50 on this, maybe with a slight preference towards cats bc everybody I know had at least one cat (or no pet at all)
Europe I think is pretty dog-person
Personal: Cats
National: Kinda both
Continental: Both I think
And I thought I was the only crazy person doing this
Thank you for being such a caring and wonderful person :)
Burgenland Croatian, it's the language of the Croatian people a Hungarian magnat invited to settle on the land the Ottomans devastated during the siege of Vienna
The land they settled became after the first WW Ro Austria
Nowadays it's a special protected language, where it's taught in schools where the majority of the ancestors of those people live

Oh boy, we have a lot of unknown companies in Austria that are actually pretty big in their sector
Let's start with ZKW, they produce LED and matrix lighting, especially for BMW for example
Then we have Rosenbauer, they are the biggest fire truck manufacturer in the world
Of course we have a lot of ski industry companies, Doppelmayr for example is one of the biggest ski lift producers worldwide
Then we have Peak Technology, they are currently creating a heat resisting shielding for the European space agency, in the past they also worked with NASA
Böhler Udeholm and Voest Alpine are big players in Steel Business
Andritz is big in powerplant business, from turbines and generators
AVL List is quiet large into engine Research and produceing test Equipment and powertrains
Rosenberger produces fire Trucks and Special utility vehicles
Rotax produces 2 and 4 Stroke engines, mainly for Bombardier, but also other Businesses
Edit: Nokia sells directly to their customers, I've bought a Phone from their Website ;)
Never know ASML was Dutch
"Alpla" : apparently they are among the world leading companies in plastic packaging
Especially plastic bottles are their main field
"Magna" : very big automobile manufacturer, I think mainly Mercedes and BMW are its customers in Austria
The company is half Canadian, so not purely Austrian
It was founded by an Austrian who went to Canada and later merged with a Canadian company
there is a head office in Austria and several factories, thats why many consider it as an Austrian company
And I would throw "Rauch" into the discussion
The are well known as B2C in Austria for a variety of fruit juices and ice tea
But what a lot of people don't know is that they produce Redbull and sell it to - of course - Red bull
Red bull does the marketing and sell it internationally
* Plasser & Theurer make rail track laying machines
* Frequentis makes air traffic control systems
* ISI Group makes CO2 capsules for airbages, fire extinguishers, emergency rafts and emergency slides and whipped cream
* Lenzing has gotten some attention lately, but they're also huge in their domaine
* Palfinger is one of the biggest makers of truck cranes
* RHI makes fire proof building materials
* Greiner AG makes lots of stuff from plastic
I'd like to add two
Wienerberger - world's biggest manufacturer of bricks and roof tiles
Also producing pavers and piping systems
Ams Ag - Microchip company, specialized in optical sensors
Apple Face ID totally depends on their sensors
Last year they bought the german lighting giant OSRAM
> Doppelmayr
they also made the longest cable car in the world in Phu Quoc if I am not mistaken
I would add Voest Alpine to that
Vorarlberg seems to punch way above it's weight
We also have with *Wolfram* one of the biggest producers of the element wolfram/tungsten
Oh and *Glock*, but i'm not sure that qualifies as unknown
Dont forget the "ams AG". If you own an iPhone, you probably have one of their sensors in it
The are one of the leading high-accuracy low power sensor producers
Andritz is huge and mostly unknown too
> Doppelmayr for example is one of the biggest ski lift producers worldwide
In what world is Doppelmayr unknown to the general public
I would totally add "Blum" to it
They make hinges and other stuff for kitchen manufacturers and you find them pretty much in every kitchen
I had never heard of them until they nearly became a customer of ours
I was suprised about the size of the company
From personal experience I would add "Wittmann-Battenfeld".
Producing Injections Molds, Automation Robots and other equipment for producing all sorts of plastics and synthetics
FN sells to consumers and is quite well known though
> ThyssenKrupp
People do not know them
Their elevators and escalators are pretty common
>Schenker (logistics)
You see the trains and trucks everywhere
Talking about Heidelberg, Unzer, formerly called Heidelpay
One of the the biggest credit card payment  processors in europe, after buying much of the competition like Austrian mPay
Thought the same :D. Not that I begrudge them
They make quality products, so why not advertise that
But everybody who owns a pair of skis probably knows them
They also installed a ski lift in North Korea
I think Glock is the complete opposite of unknown
However most people probably don't know that they are based in Austria
Oh, i know some people working there, they hate the puns with their company name (AMS is also called the unemployment Agency Here for None Austrians)
Always thought Infineon was Austrian, but it seems they are German but have their production Sites here
ZF is from Germany though
Is it so strange that when NK wants a ski lift, they get an well-known ski lift company to do it
>However most people probably don't know that they are based in Austria
It's very prominently Austrian
Even Americans know its from Austria (even when they wouldn't be able to point at Austria on a map)
Well that backfired
No it's interesting how they got a Austrian company to do it even tough there was a trade embargo at that time
It is not just a German thing but there are a lot more of these companies in Germany than in most other countries
It could be that most of these companies are founded and run by a family that were formerly trade people
From my point of view Craftsmanship and trade is more institutionalised in german speaking countries and therefore they don't want to sell their company to a bigger one, because they "know what they are doing" compared to a ceo with just an economics background
Or it could be that all the smaller companies dream of becoming Bosch one day
They still don't contribute to the stock market and are just run by one family
I'm not reliant on a car in daily life and mostly use my bike or public transport
I wouldn't want to live without a driver's licence though
I drive a lot when on my travels or weekend trips
I'd have missed the most beautiful places and scenes in my life without a car
When exploring (whether it's the surroundings or another country), public transport is inadequate
Also, it's nice to be able transport larger items without a hassle or to rent an Ikea truck to move homes
Yes and no
I have a kid and I have a busy life, so when I am in Berlin, yes
Vienna is another story, because my apartment is on the canal facing the most central district so I can almost walk everywhere
Weekend and day trips out of the city still require the use of my car, though and my husband also had a car
Yep
I live in Vienna and I sometimes drive to other cities/villagers per train
I don't need a car license
I will do one if I need it
If you are under 15, you cannot ride your bike without an adult, unless you got a bike license
Same here
Arnold Schwarzenegger is glad that you specified the type of oak
The Styrian Oak would care
The point is tha Balkan carries cultural weight
It is not a purely geographic definition, it is more akin to say a state is deep south in the US or dixie
You will get a bunch of oppinions that may vary over time and shift
The Balkans is where two big christian churches clashed with Islam, where Empires and nations influenced by western, eastern European and the muslim world met and mixed
A region that saw very different influences and in which very difficult nation forming happened in the 19th and 20th century
So as there is no clear set border of what Europe is, there is no clear border on what the Balkans as a region are
>We learned that the balkans are bordered by the Mediterranean, Marmara sea, and Black Sea
North border is the Danube and Sava river
So technicallly only half of Croatia is in it
The definition isn't as clear in real life
Yes, you can just learn the borders of the Balkan peninsula, but the cultural/political definition of the Balkan is not as clearly defined
The whole discussion in this thread isn't as much about geography as it is about politics and culture
Homestly no, Greece does not come to my mind when thinking about Balkan
There is a saying in western Austria, the Balkan starts in Vienna
Viennese say it starts in the 16th district
On a serious note there is the distinction between West Balkans which mainly is former Yugoslavia and Albania maybe minus Slovenia and estern Balkan that is oriented towards the black sea
But then again, what is Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe not even the Scandinavians can sort out what ultimatly encompasses their region
The geographic term is well defined, but Balkan is more a cultural concept around here, associated with music, food, ethnicities, culture etc
Vienna has quite sizeable communities from most of the Balkan states, so for many people it is also back home or their families place
It carries weight
Of my direct four neighbours one are a croat couple another a mixed austrian/serb one
The first documented mention of Austria dates back to 980ish
Houses from the 1800s are quite common everywhere and quite a few across Austria are (at least in part) considerably older
We have numerous Roman sites (Vindobona, Aguntum, Carnuntum even had a miniature Collosseum), Celtic sites, dating back a few thousand of years, also pretty much all over the country
Salt minery has been big in western Austria for thousands of years too, creating massive wealth during the bronze and/or iron age
And of course one of the most famous mummies "Oetzi" is some 5 thousand years old
So yeah, there's been a lot going on here and there's written history if a lot of it, much of it due to the fact that we were center to the Habsburg Empire
Only Thing people I know found by digging around are Nazi stuff (I know two people who found a SS dagger in their Field) and Unexploded ordnance
My town's history goes back quite some time
It's happened a few times that construction work had to be stopped because they dug up some old structures or artifacts that then needed to be evaluated by archeologists and historians
I once had a side job on one of those archeological digs on a construction site right in the middle of town
It was mostly stuff from the 16th to 18th century, but while we were working there we also found some pottery shards in the deeper layers that were around 2000 years old, which was a minor archeological surprise
The shards are thought to be proof that this region had very early settlements
Depending on where you live, it's very very easy
Example: I live in the 3rd district of Vienna
If I walk down my street there's [a carpentry] at the corner, in a half basement
When they built the house in 1910, they found copper melting ovens in the floor of this half basement, as well as old roof tiles
The age of those ovens and tiles was around 2000 years
So there was a Roman metal working facility there
The Romans stayed there until around the 4th century, then the *Quadi* came and fucked shit up
The facility burned down around that time
My whole neighbourhood actually is a historic area as there was not only a Roman civilian settlement for a long time (right outside of the military city Vindobona, now in the 1st district of Vienna), but before that it had been a Celtic settlement since the Bronze Ages
But not only my neighbourhood, is like that
In the center ofc there was Vindobona, so they find a lot of stuff there always, and west of that was another civilian settlement
So whenever they dig up something, or build new houses anywhere in those areas of Vienna, they find some antique shit, and then a team of archeologists come and take a look at it
[City Hall has its own team of archeologists] They find interesting stuff beginning from the late neolithicum until the most recent decades
But since you can't reconstruct a Celtic/Roman city on top of a living contemporary city, they are doing it virtually
Every little piece they find in some construction site hole, completes the puzzle a bit more
Right now they are building a new subway line, and expand another, inlcuding a big station where both lines will cross
That is a huge deal for those archeologists
&nbsp;
As for my hometown Linz, it's very similar really
Also lots of Celtic and Roman stuff
Like, [there's this little earth wall/ rampart] in a park on a hill, right next to the old city center
The rampart looks like a natural hill, but really it's an artificial earth wall that was constructed by some Celts ~3000 years ago
They had a kind of earth, wood, and brick made castle up there, but it burned down at some point
Well, I live near a road that has gotten its name because there were a lot of ancient roman coins found there
Our oldest documented building in town was built sometime before 1164 and the oldest church, along with a castle were built in 1438
This castle and church are standing to this day
We had a castle at the city center built in the 13th century but it was destroyed by the french in the 19th century, except for two buildings
&#x200B;
Also, in my state, we regularly find old roman artifacts, and a couple of years ago they found some roman ruins near our airport
When in Rome
Hate to be the nitpicker, but isn't that an artefact
The German word for bunker is Bunker
Blockhaus is a house made from blocks of wood
Its also rarely used as a special kind of small military building
We learn about the different institutions of the EU in the Gymnasium, when students are between 14 and 18 Years old
There are entire chapters dedicated to it in history and geography class
I would say our educational system is in tune with the europeam elections as well
Same here
Specialiced on European institutions and policy making in my studies before I vered to general public management
Hadn't I been interested in the topic in school beforehand I would not have known anything but the most basic stuff
But that's also due to Austria joining the EU only a few years before I finished school so most teachers were completly clueless about it
But I doubt that it changed too much as schools in Austria are generally bad on teaching people basic stuff on any political institution - many people are clueless about political and state institution in general not just the EU
My experience was pretty different from yours
We learned about the institutions, how they are made up, what their job is etc
Of course we didn't go into the hard details of how the EU works, but its fair to say that we knew:
* What the institutions, such as the Court of the EU, the parliament etc
are and what they are responsible for
* How they are elected/formed
* How the EEA (Switzerland and Norway) fit into the picture
* The history of the EU, starting at WW2
* Some stuff that was important at the time
Which basically comes down to TTIP/CETA and why the EU is responsible for trade in the first place as well as the refugee crisis
So yeah, definitely enough to get by I would say
Edit: I went to a "Gymnasium" and then a "HTL", just in case this makes a difference
I went to a Gymnasium then HAK
We actually had 2 hours of civic education, which was a jokebin retrospect
But that was very much the teachers fault
I think that was in 1998
Only thing we got into any detail was the currency union but that was in our economics class
But I am happy if it has changed to the better
To be honest looking back at my time in school I am surprised how much special knowledge and trivia they teached us, while omitting the basic stuff it built on
IMHO many things were never of any use as they had ecome obsolete by the time we left school
It is too often teaching to then test meaningless trivia, while omiting real capacity building
Cash or per App
Or in a ticket shop in advance, where they take everything
I like the ÖBB app for train travel
For small bus trips I prefer cash, when I commuted I paid a half year card in advance
App usually
Online, with card in the shops and in cash
I prefer the online method
Cost are 365€ per year for the whole city (Bus, Tramways and Metro/Underground) (!! I THINK, I COULDN'T FIND THE ACTUAL PRICES but that is what I remember !!)
70€ a year for students with a valid student id
The student ticket also includes Lower Austria and Burgenland making it possible to go to a school in Lower Austria or Burgenland
Cash, credit cards, or app (which also accepts PayPal, **finally**)
I personally prefer using the app if I need to go outside Vienna by train, while I use my yearly ticket to travel within the city
Never change a running system is the unofficial slogan of Austria
Can't you still get paper tickets in Tallinn when you buy directly from the driver
I think you  still could when I was there some years ago
Personally I'm not mad that there are still methods that don't depend on smart phones (I still know many Seniors who don't own one) or involve ones every move (potentially) being tracked with every swipe of a card
Though that's probably just my paranoid, reward-card-hating heart talking
But it's not like the paper tickets are the only way
It's just an additional option
The machines are already there, probably more expensive to get rid of them than keep them ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Huh, I guess they haven't updated the English text [on this official website] in quite some time then
>Paper ticket wich you get from the driver you do not need to validate
The annual ticket is a personalised plastic card like a credit card and shows up in the app
And every other ticket is directly availablie through the WL app
So yeah we have those paper tickets but those are for tourists who don't want to install the app and old people
Jugendtickets are different
They are either e-tickets on the smartphone ,print at home or paper tickets
Considering what I saw from a colleague of mine I understand why, children loose them way to often, so they are easy to replace
Last time i did this i was still in elementary school and itwas for a school photo, teacher told us to say "cheese" but we chose to say "Ameisenscheiße" ("ant shit") most of the time
Sam here, also the classic "Cheeeeese"
„Oh so you‘re from Austria
I always wanted to go there and see some Kangaroos
Or even worse: „Austria eh
So basically you are German
You don‘t know how fast (the always friendly) Austrians can get mad at you with these questions
"Sou you're basically german right
" Noooo please no
"Nice, I actually know someone from [insert random German city]"
.. I feel you
people thinking that Austria with its 1000 year long history, that clearely seperated itself from Germany after the Austro-Prussian war both in culture and language would just be a part of modern days Germany
I have a Slovakian friend who is a sound engineer
And I have a Czech one two, Czech one two
We have the first female chancellor in our history
Gay people can get married now (old news), even if one of the partners has the nationality of a  country where gay marriage is illegal (new news)
I think usually you say "child pornography". Some people online call it "kiddie porn", but I think that's a disgusting and trivializing term
Karl-Marx-Hof in Vienna is the longest (1
1km) residential building in the world
I stick with my solution
50 walloons, 50 from flanders, 1 from that german area
Drop them somewhere in siberia, give them guns, last survivor decides the government
Beating out Iraq, no less
Nope, never heard of that guy, I barely ever use Youtube
I can't even remember how I learned about it, I'm just very interested in Red Vienna
So far i have only heard of french, swedes, polish, austrians, turks and germans freezing to death in russia
So we can't really say if belgiums or germans are better at dealing with the russian winter
If that question would be in german i at least could make the joke, i don't eat "kartoffeln" (german word for potatoes) i only eat "erdäpfel" (austrian word for potatoes) so nothing changes, but no you ruined that opportunity
I'd weep for my tuberous friends; then increase my parsnip, sweet potato, and cassava intake
And *what* the fuck is going on in your kebap shops
"doners woefully incomplete"? Who puts *potatoes* into a Döner, and in what form
Who puts potatoes in a Döner
Outside of fries I don't really eat potatoes
And we can improvise for those
My Balkan colleagues agree with you
Yes and austria (and some south german areas, mostly south baveria) isn't the only nation that does that
The nederlands calls them "aardaaple" which also means earthapple
The french call then "pomme de terre" which means apple from the earth
Austrians definitely have Kapsalon
The most bland of all the breads
And if not bland sweeter than goddamn brioche
yes
You dont have to go the US for that
Ireland is really bad as well :/
No diversity in flour types if you want to make bread yourself for example
And where I was (Meynooth) they had only White bread
Austrians can definitely go crazy about skiing
[Here's] the atmosphere at the  night race in Schladming every year
Ski jumping can also draw large and passionate crowds as can Formula 1 at our annual race in Spielberg
As for violence, no, there is no hooligan culture around other sports (AFAIK) like in football/soccer
Just a lot of partying and drinking
>As for violence, no, there is no hooligan culture around other sports (AFAIK) like in football/soccer
Not as bad as football, but Icehockey has some pretty hardcore fans
No, we're going crazy about Alpine Skiing, which in its modern form was invented in Austria
It all fell apart since Marcel Hirscher retired, but hey, we were the best nation at the World Ski Championships 2021
Norway is always winning nordic skiing
We are talking about alpine skiing, which we are the best at
Yes that one
Not the "cross-country skiing". The "skiing-skiing".
Hardly
The most successful alpine skier in history was indeed a Swedish man, not Norwegian: Ingemar Stenmark
He won 86 world cup races during his career
He's followed by the Austrians Marcel Hirscher (67 wins) and Hermann Maier (54 wins)
The most successful woman was the American Lindsey Vonn with 82 wins
As for the most successful Nations overall, Norway has the 14th most wins in history of women's races (9 wins), and 4th most wins in men's races (143 wins)
Austria of course being the very clear #1 in both cases (370 wins for the women, 490 for the men)
Yes that's the word
I know you are talking about cross country skiing, we are talking about downhill skiing
In German there are totally different words for these two
I think he is talking about cross country skiing (Langlaufen)
The Norwegians are definitely better in that one
In German the downhill skiing is called "Schifahren" and the cross country skiing is called "Langlaufen". I didn't even know until today that there is no extra word for "Langlaufen" in English
We would try to argue with germany while getting ignored by them
While smoking at the table
So the same we would do with south tyrol and italy
Is the US even old enough to drink beer yet
O.o
In Austria we do that too
With the difference that we are way older and raised you, so you are more that teenager that doesn't listen to his parents anymore
The time our army lost a fight against itself because it fought over some alcohol
Thats basicly the most austrian thing ever and i am surprised it only happened once
Noone is 100% it really happened this way
But something happened thats for sure
The Germans had one like this called "Die Deutschen".
It was entertaining enough but not very objective and definitely a headscratcher
Historians almost universally loathed it
The story is apocryphical and never once mentioned in official documents
It only crops up in some newspapers well after the fact
Most likely its just an embelished story that soon became a modern myth
Theres an incident on the frontline which may have been the inspiration for this in a report to the Austrian court occuring on the 23
September 1788
It claims that the Austrians sent their supplies to the city of Karansebes while the cavalry should keep the Ottomans at bay
When the people on the supply train heard the shots by both the Austrian and Ottoman forces some of the leaders of the supply carts panicked and fled without the supplies
Some of these supplies were then captured by the advancing Turks while the rest of the supply train was reorganized and went on
Total casualties among the cavalry were 150 men
The Spanish Republicans are close to my heart
Always especially sad when I see the placques for the Spanish Republicans murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp near where I live
Oh absolutely
History classes as a whole should move away from "national" and great man history with battles, high politics and the like and focus also on technological and societal history
Things like the introduction of a new crop rotation system or the invention of new milling technology or the developments of city and town structures were way more important in the development of a region than the guy that extracted the taxes from them
>Ionian Islands
Don't forget them being Sicilian before that
Takeshi's Castle, do I even need to say more
Good thing you added the same quality prerequisite
I'm a bit gutted we didn't get our own version of 'The Office'. Then again, it might be too similar to the German one
once again, we are too close to Germany for our own good
any big-budget special effects disaster/blockbuster movie like armageddon, independence day or a marvel movie
let other cities be the center of the alien action for once (also I think it would be a lot of fun to see places you recognize in all these explosion scenes for a change)
I really enjoyed the first Bourne movie for that reason (the European setting)
alternatively, give me GTA5, but situated in Vienna
I second this motion
THIS
it would also teach people a bit about the inner workings of the EU, something every citizen should know about
just make it have good actors, and let there be some good guys (mostly in Parliament) as well
the Commission can mostly be the bad guys for all I care, haha
not necessarily rural (which Shoplifters also isn't?), but imho there's various good "chav life" movies, [Fish Tank] being among the best ones, it's a gut-wrenching mix between Kids, Cuties, and The Florida Project
and if you liked Shoplifters and would like more of the same Japanese setting, you'd probably also enjoy Tokyo Godfathers by the great [Satoshi Kon] good Christmas movie
but why yes there is
or have you never had to fill out an application with our dear people at the MA2412
I always dreamed of a assassin's creed in Vienna around 1900
I never saw it that way but i guess you're right
although having rewatched some of it recently i have to say it didn't age all that well
I've encountered quite a few people who unironically said that Austria is fully responsible for WW2
We are obviously only 98% responsible
That we don't have kangaroos
* [Just recently they caught an albino one]
* [Here's another one even out in the snow]
* [This one was close to Bad Ischl]
You do
Paul Joseph Watson
I heard in the US there's a lot of dry counties
Especially in Kentucky and Tennessee
It's that also because of Shakira law
> I've seen countless comments on /r/TIL that British accents used to sound American but we changed them as to not sound American
Wouldn't the other way round make much sense
Early American English sounding a lot more like British English and then it started to change because of the large distance between them and stuff
Similarly to how [Texas German] sounds nothing like any German dialect around in Europe today
That’s the same in every large city
I live in bangkok for around 1/2 year and the amount of people who complain about their newly chosen / forced upon them home is staggering
>Another one is that we have somehow overly low alcohol-taxes when infact they are one of the highest ones in Europe
First time i hear that one
Everyone know you're nordic and nordic alc is expensive
Where are you from again
Whats a finland
Lol
What are the maltese authorities gonna do
Attack me with their one battleship
Joke is on them, i live in a landlocked country
Not for much longer
Aaww really
You guys listened to our radio
I feel so appreciated right now
Shh
Rather Kurz getting into the EU commission in 10-15 years and deploying heavy military forces to the Turkish border because of climate refugees
Literally taliban
How much is 0
5l of finnish beer
No u
Interesting
So you're saying a fleet of old timey galleons with enough cannons could take Malta
now kiss
1,95€ *without* taxes
in a supermarket
Ah okay
I've never been to Malta
You should be fine then i guess
That's really expensive
Here I can buy 0,5l of low quality beer for 0,6 - 0,8€ in a supermarket, given there's no special offer
Mineral water is about the same or more expensive
Quality beer is around 1€-1,10€ (everything including taxes)
That explains a lot about nordic people's behaviour when they are here
I'd say Jack Unterweger
Guy murders a woman, goes to prison, becomes an very successful author in there, convinces people he changed, has a celebrity fan club that helps him to get out on parole, starts a serial murder spree on two continents WHILE reporting on those exact murders for the radio, getting caught again and finally hangs himself in prison
I'd guess the ["Ibiza affair"] when a video of our then vice chancellor was leaked where he was drunk, in a tank top, on a Finca in Ibiza, trying to sell Austrian water and our largest newspaper to a faux niece of a russian oligarch
Is that blur Xavier Naidoo
>having sex with a prostitute and beeing caught red handed in a police raid
Bless god I live in a country where prostitution is legal
The Nordic model is a failure and many experts and most sex workers agree
Sorry for the off topic rant, but I did quite some research on that topic, and I mostly found that most laws protecting prostitutes only improve the conscience of feminists and conservatives, but the voices of sex workers mostly get ignored
Here a very good video on the topic by philosophy tube, featuring the speaker of the American sex worker association: [
\-rant over
I'm still wondering why this is called "incest" in the french media instead of "rape" or "child abuse"... like, was this a consentual relationship
How old was the stepson
Complete sociopath but a highly talented one
People wanted him as an example that people can change in prison and become successful and worthy members of the society again
He knew that and he played them
There is one, but only a small Austrian one:
Swedish model aka Nordic model which makes buying sex illegal but only for the one who buys it, look it up
It is celebrated by feminists and loathed by sex workers with many studies showing that it's effectiveness is questionable, and violent assault against sex workers raising by a factor of then in France ...
Yo, flag-thief, we don't know who you are referring to
:D ;)
But that one's boring
We have so many other sociopaths that never get the recognition they deserve lol
I don't post a scientific link history on reddit, I have other work to do as well ... but before judging 1) Watch the video it's well researched 2) Google up sources about the problem beginning with remarks of sex worker societies world wide, but let me help for a start:  The main reason I got aware of this problem was the blog of the Austrian Sex Worker Society:
3) Yes I am male, so what
Stop your prejeduces and do some research
My main concern is that everyone talks about sexwork, but virtually no one cares about the voice of the sex workers themselves, they have no lobby and are between conservatives and progressives alike who still think that all sex workers are basically slaves although the truth lies in the middle
Yes ... this is the reason why I explained it to him
To be fair, the basement-owners weren't celebs before
If it weren't for that part of OP's question then yeah, there'd be a lot more Austrian examples
For me it was „Sweat (A La La La La Long)” by Inner Circle
I used to sing it all the time as a kid, even in front of my parents
I think I was like 16 when I first paid attention to the lyrics
The song "Bobby Brown" by Frank  Zappa is still played rather often in the radio
Which wouldn't be the case if people knew what it was about
He once was invited to the German TV-Show "Wetten dass", where he had translated the lyrics into German beforehand so everybody knew what he was singing about
Transmission was cut after a few seconds
I realized how *Brenda's Got a Baby* by 2Pac was about a girl who got raped by her cousin, got pregnant, had the baby in a public bathroom and dropped it into a garbage container because she was so overwhelmed, only to retrieve it later and then start dealing with drugs to make a little money
My all time favourite: The Divinyls
I don't want anybody else, when I think about you I touch myself oooh
You fucking what when ???
Because of similar experiences nearly every time I actively look up the lyrics of a song I like, I normally make it a point of *not* listening to lyrics in songs anymore
More often than not, they ruin a perfectly fine song for me
The opposite experience of being touched by "profound" lyrics has happened to me maybe once or twice in my life, at most, and it's just not something I go and look for
If I want emotionally touching words, I go read poetry (and I normally don't, because I find the whole concept kinda cringy)
If I want intellectually stimulating statements, I'll go read non-fiction
If I want the joy of using language creatively and word play, I go and read authors that are good at that, or do it myself
Listening to music, I mostly want to enjoy nice beats and interesting rhythms
Vocals normally are a distraction to that, and I try my hardest to listen to them as just another instrument (which is made easier tremendously by the fact that most songs are in English, and as a non-native, I can choose to kind of blend out the meaning of words most of the time)
It's gotten to the point where I really have to strain to hear words and not just sounds, and have to look up lyrics if I really want to know what a song is about (and normally, promptly regret I did so)
An exception to all that are songs with creative lyrics in my mother language, which I appreciate especially when they're using local dialect
But there's hardly any songs like that, and I listen to them very rarely
Mostly it's music without vocals, or vocals in languages I don't understand, or tuning out the lyrics I *could* understand
Works fine for me
it was more popular in the past, I can remember the "Kinderfreunde" always had adds for their camps in the alps
Hello everyone :)
Definitely one of my favourite subreddits :D
PogChamp
Twice a year
Always make the next appointment when I am there, because otherwise I know I wouldn't go
Also made the experience, that there is waaaay less work to be done when you go regularily
Only going there when in pain simply means you went there too late
May and November each year, for as long as I can remember
That's the most british comment in here
By the amount of people who think ww1 was startet by germans i think there is a small detail about austria many nations don't teach
Austria was a christian fascist country before Hitler invaded
Hitler was Austrian not German
Hey we learn about your history
from the moment we annexed you till the moment we lost you
r/me_ira
I mean Slovenia was part of the HRE after all
>Before that Austria was just one of many German states and pretty much all Austrians considered themselves Germans
Austria was several german states which together where the Habsburg Corelands, you know
Haus Österreich
>Austrian as a national identity distinct from German was only born post WW2 when everyone wanted to distance themselves from Germany and it's Nazi reputation
The Idea of a "Austrian Identity" was formed about the same time as the Idea of a german one
There were a lot of ideas discussed during the Dawn of Nationalism
It was focused after the Austrian Prussian War
I know it's a shame
Why was it deleted
The first time 1787, with some exceptions and modifications over the next hundred years
All pushed by a scientific comittee and the emperors personal will
In WW1 it was allowed again
In 1920 when the first republic was established, they abolished it again, the country was trying to be modern and liberal in general
In 1933 the Austrofascists allowed it again, and the Nazis kept it of course
In 1950 it was abolished again with some exceptions (that were never used) and since 1968 it was completely abolished
The last execution was 1950
There was one small extreme far right party (National Democrat Party
nothing suspicious about that name eh) that called for getting it back but they were irrelevant
Otherwise it's not a topic at all
Don't forget Frank stronach, who suggested reestablish it in 2013, when he campaigned for national elections
(he just gained enough votes to win some seats in Parliament, partly due to this)
The Last one was 1955 but under the juristication of the Allied forces
Kinda depends on where you're from
Switzerland/Norway/Iceland/Australia/New Zealand
Cool
USA
50/50 I'd say
China/Korea
There's definitely some reservations
If you're coming from Turkey most people won't look at you as an Expat but most likely think you're an immigrant worker
I mean it brought us Coffee
I think most people are grateful about that ;)
Not necessarily
There's a lot folks with Balkan roots that are indistinguishable from locals
My former boss has a name I can't even say out loud
My bank representative is from the Balkans
In both cases people are kinda surprised when they realise they aren't born here
I think the Balkan community in Austria is much bigger, has a lot more history dating back to the monarchy and is much more diverse in the public reception
But I must say: these are my personal experiences living in Vienna and moving in the circles I do
This might not be 100% accurate
And of course if you run around looking like a low level drug dealer people will treat you as one
Because pnany people are idiots
There's for one stereotypes
you know like arrogant unfriendly Frenchmen of which I have never met any outside of Paris
But these stereotypes exist and some people believe them
Obviously not every American weighs 270lbs, owns 6-8 guns and while they can name their president in 1834 don't know that Africa isn't a country that's bordering Russia or fail to do simple maths
But some people do believe firmly in stereotypes
The USA just doesn't have that kind of laid-back, chilled image of Australia or NZ
And then - and I say that in the most neutral way I can - the USA have been burning their reputation for decades now
During the cold war it was kinda cool to have someone to have your back and afterwards starting with Clinton there was a lot of diplomatic capital that got burned
During the Kosovo War in '99 the US interfered without UN mandate so Austria, as a neutral country, didn't allow the US Air Force to enter our airspace for bombing runs from German NATO airfields to Kosovo
But the US Air Force didn't care and violated the airspace nonetheless
Then there was this whole Bush Jr
thing which from an Austrian perspective was mostly the supreme court deciding that their friend's son should become president although he lost the election
And after 9/11 the "war on terror" quickly became a vehicle for US imperialism, further destabilising an already volatile region
This led to some pretty strong anti-american sentiments for some people
Then there was Obama who continued the bombings and the war in the Middle East
And the one thing people around here could get behind that he did -- working out some sort of general healthcare for at least for those who couldn't afford it -- was publicly torpedoed by even some Democrats
The Snowden leaks and the NSA scandal didn't portray the USA in a favourable light either
Thus the political image of the USA being the school bully who takes what he pleases and thinks he's popular
And then the era of Donald Trump followed and I guess I don't have to tell you that this generally didn't reflect well on the USA as a whole around here either
Now combine that with the already existing stereotypes that leads to some people not only thinking that every American is a fat dumb gun-nut but actually now seeing Americans as representative of the USA's foreign policy
This leads to the sentiment by some people that all Americans should just leave Europe - no matter if you're in a military posting, a diplomat or just some random guy that some company hired and sent to Austria
Now I don't say that's all people
And most people I would say have no issues whatsoever
But the US kinda lost their favourable image and sometimes you have to break the stereotype and specify that you do know how to use your inside-voice indoors, that you don't think it's a good idea to arm teachers, that you can actually find your current location on a globe and that Arnold Schwarzenegger was in fact the greatest action movie actor of the 80s ;)
But as in most cases it depends on whom you're talking to
I'm Austrian so you can imagine the amount of Nazi and Hitler comments I sometimes get online
And most of them are very poor effort even
Also what I would say especially for Austria - can't really say that for other places - is that casual racism is kind of prominent
It's something many especially slightly older people don't even do consciously or with any kind of malicious intend but they sometimes are curious nor just don't know how to deal with being out of their comfort zone and experiencing someone 'different' and I know from some international friends that they at least at first feel/felt rather uncomfortable because of that
Especially since many Austrians are rather private people and are really bad at small talk which doesn't make it easy, especially for expats here
The arrogance and ignorance of about 50% of the country
(not op)
You can use every East-Asian nationality instead of Korea
I'm not sure a lot of people would be able to tell whether someone comes from Korea or China unless they explicitly tell you
And you know
many people are kind of afraid or on edge of everything that is highly different to what they're used to and what they're unfamiliar with
Korea and China certainly are places with a highly different culture
Well you're welcome to become my neighbor ;)
>many other countries
There's only 9 countries with a large number of orthodox Christians
>I sure hope my rent transfer will be processed in time
I'm still fascinated that in 2021 banks still aren't able to process payments 7 days a week
I'm OK with no 24/7 but come on
There's definitely a reason why paypal and Venmo are that popular
Winter 0
5-1 time per day
Summer 1-2 times per day
usually 1x a day (before going to bed)
If I do sports in the morning and I cannot combine the after-sport-shower with my evening-shower then it's 2x.
In summer I might also shower 2 or 3 times to cool off or to get fresh when I have a meeting or something
After doeing something sweaty or once per day
I can see where it comes from, I guess I would sweat in Brazil climate the whole day,
I'm a bit suprised many here don't take baths, I try to get one once a week, usually it's just I don't have enough time for it or I'm to fucking tired
Wheel, or just a knife
I don't get the idea of scissors because that means you have to lift the pizza up to do so which potentially results in a mess
This is
Oh my, how can you, this is
...actually pretty clever
Where are the Italians
As far as I know, in some parts of Italy (especially Napoli), pizza is cut with scissors
Many people in Austria use [these] Some of course just use a knife
I’ve actually never seen or heard of someone cutting pizza with scissors
But I will do that the next time I don’t have a pizza cutter
I have a friend of mine and she‘s one of the food sinners, as we call them lovingly in our Server
Also she‘s german so ig she doesn‘t really count for Austria
Around here I never heard of scissors
You never had a good pizza wheel then
Its not that bad
You use a long pair of scissors and gently slide under the pizza while holding the scissor almost vertically
Much quicker and easy to use than a pizza wheel
Three words:
Dedicated kitchen scissors
I use the old fingers and knife method
It guarantees uneven pieces and messy hands and sometimes even a cut pizza
> Much quicker and easy to use than a pizza wheel
I'm really wondering if people ITT have never used a sharp pizza wheel/knife, because cutting a pizza with a sharp wheel takes like 2 seconds
Don't tell me that's faster with scissors
But even if you don't use the wheel, just cutting it with a sharp knife is super quick, you don't need to lift anything up, and you are having an easier time cleaning
I'm really trying to understand what advantage a scissor has but I just cannot see how scissors are better than a sharp knife
I'll try it tomorrow but I'm pretty sure the knife is easier
> squashing force of a knife
Do people not have sharp knifes
Did you never encounter an actual sharp knife
A sharp knife cuts even through soft things and doesn't squash anything
You don't "push the surface down before the cut", the cut starts as soon as you touch the toppings
Are you really claiming that scissors do less squashing on for example a cooked grape tomatoe than a sharp knife
Basically pay up a doctor (that was of very dubious quality) or die
Austria jokes mostly about Vienna about nearly everything possible
There is a common saying, "Wien ist anders", which is used most of the time to swipe away how absurd Vienna actually is
Just Like in Austria
Only they Look especially down on "Burgenland"
Also there are some jokes that Vorarlberg is the Austrian version of New Zealand just because it gets forgotten sometimes
Or the popular jokes about Fucking
sorry
Fugging
Don't forget the general pity that is given to Burgenland always
I get why:
- It's flat as fuck (highest elevation 800m)
- it doesn't have *any* cities, and its capital town is in Hungary
- they either talk weird German or weird Croatian
- half the people who are from there leave because it's so boring
- you have to constantly drink wine in order to stand the boredom of living there
- the public transport is shit, there's like one train going there per day
- the only slightly cool thing they have is a huge and extremely shallow lake that is really more like a puddle of dirt + lots of storks
- Gottfried Küssel lives there
The ones joking about Vienna are just jealous because they don't live in the world's most livable city
My experience:
Counties people joke about: Vienna, Burgenland, Carinthia
Counties people don't joke about: Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Styria
Counties nobody cares about: nö, oö
I think it was renamed to Fucking because the local sign was vandalized to say Fucking all the time lmao (don‘t quote me on that one tho)
Austria's least livable village is still better than the world's most livable city
>Counties people don't joke about: Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Styria
Gsiberger Witze are very common in all of Austria
As they are the only ones with an Alemannian dialect
Styria jokes are are very common in states that border Styria
The opposite
It was renamed to Fugging because people stole the Fucking- road signs all the time
If you're a yodelling hillbilly
Wous houst du groud gsogt
I thought I saw a post of Fucking being named to Fugging and later being renamed to Fucking because people vandalized the sign to say Fucking again on the r/Austria subreddit, but I think I was wrong
Sorry for that one
I am
Fair enough
Honestly I love Vienna, it's a beautiful city with a lot of grumpy people
I just could not live there, I'm not made for any city
I need mountains and rivers and less people
Right
Would make sense especially for the alive and well French movie industry
Maybe it doesn't get its own name when it's just situated in the capital (as I assume is the case in France)
That's how I think it is here, everything movie-related happens in the dominant capital, but nobody goes around making up the name Viennawood for that
Oh I see
Cannewood it is then, or Forêt Canne or something similar
Vienna (1
9 Million): Completely oversized for a small country like Austria (~8
85 Million)
It's the only big city we have and is politically really important
Graz: (290
000): A nice looking city
I don't know a lot about it
As it is cut off from the western and northern parts of Austria by the mountains so you normally don't visit it too often
Graz is a lovely looking city with an intact and cozy old-town
Living there is extremely cheap
Graz is a student city
Linz (207
000): Industrial city, many joke about that it's a steel-factory with houses built around it
Of course that's not entirely true
But the whole region and metropolitan area (<700
000) is an industrial and production hub in Austria
Most of Austrias exports come from here
The thing with Vienna is, that it was not intended to be capital for tiny Austria but it was built to be the centre of hapsburg empire
The land around it crumbled and therefore it fell out of proportion
I would say Vienna tries to hold up old standards with high culture such as museums, opera and theatre, but mainly for tourists
They try to position itself as a wine region; there is a surprising big area used for winemaking but compared to other regions in Austria it is not that big (in the other wine regions there is hardly any other stream of income big enough to mention)
By the rest of Austria Vienna is seen as unfriendly and arrogant
Viennese leave the impression of not being in touch with the rest of Austria and people complain about decisions being made "by Vienna", referring to the head of politics
Although the Bundesländer and counties are much more powerful it sometimes reminds me of French people complaining about Paris, since all decisions are made there
There is a common attribute used for viennese: "großkopfert" or "big headed". Since more than a hundred years some critics referred to Vienna as the "wasserkopf von Österreich" literally meaning "hydrocephalus" since it was already big for the capital of hapsburg empire
Completely off topic, but i got hungry by just reading about debreziner sausage and szegediner goulash
Bless you my hungarian Friends
We truly have inherited many great dishes from hungary
I've been to Bolzano a few times because of the cultural ties it has with Austria, but other than that I wouldn't really know why anyone would rather visit Bolzano over for example Milano
It's not that nice of a city I think
I think we don’t have mandatory vaccinations - but to have access to a lot of social services you need to have an up to date “mutter kind pass” (mother - child pass)
So everybody does the tests and vaccinations in the pass
Ifs basixally a stick and carrot approach and works amazingly well
Yes, we used to do that with most foreign monarchs
Louis XIV was Ludwig XIV (still is) and Henry VIII was Heinrich VIII
It was also done with popes, except with the current one everybody agreed that "Papst Franz" sounds silly, so the media went with Fraziskus instead (which is half Latin half German)
For ancient history we tend to use Greek/Latin names for rulers that are now more commonly called by their names in their own languages
Thus German scholars often call the pharaoh Akhenaten Echnaton instead
Slovakia
Vienna isn't as horrible as people from other parts of Austria think
And vice versa
It's a pretty popular thing to think here since seemingly so many of them immigrate to Western Europe
Yeah, but you're from *Russia*.
It probably has a better reputation in Austria than most of Western Europe
Moreso in general it seems to be usually stereotyped as your average small shitty post-communist country
Don't get me wrong, I don't think Slovakia is super exciting or anything, but I just barely notice any difference when crossing the border apart from the occasional commie blocks like in Petržalka
It's a nice and cozy country with chill people
I mean it's basically our fault because they are catered to us, but the border region is filled with cheap brothel's and street prostitutes
Ask Austrians about it
"Yes, it's the best city for the rich expats they interviewed
" & "They just didn't set foot into district XYZ" is what you are going to hear
That Russia is (and I know that's not true - the entire comment was a joke) a hellish hellhole
Compared to it, everything would seem nice
From the Gopniks eating Semechki to crazy Lada drivers ...
I am *very* serious about making generalizations based on stereotypes
;) I actually read that comment before posting that one, didn't realize you were the guy
Most people realize it's not that simple and that most people are not dicks
I think I only worked in "unconventional" companies so far - each had their own traditions that nobody else ever heard of
At one, drinking beer at work was totally normal
Whenever someone had a birthday, or a important project was finished, or whatever, the whole department got together for a few beers
Just in the middle of the day and back to work
On normal days too, if you felt like it, just grab a beer and keep working
I suspect my department lead came up with that, afterall he lead the IT department in a big brewery before
Some startups do this with their "beer fridges" for late night crunches but that was different
And quite a while ago
Oh we never got actually drunk at work (tipsy on Friday afternoon maybe
), it was almost always 1-3 beers max
It was about the beer and the coworkers, not alcohol
My department lead was pretty impressive, you could give him a beer in an unmarked glass and he could tell you pretty precisely what part of the country it's from
Always brought fun new beers to try too
I guess you don't become a certified beer sommelier, and work for a brewery, without a reason
Would say Vodka Juniors but their songs are in English
But worth checking out
Heathen Foray - Mei Laund
That's pretty much what you asked for, sans the local instruments
Judging by your rules, absolutely not what you're looking for but [a national treasure]
I've never heard anyone else mention Van Canto before
To those who don't know: they are an acapella (drums are usually the only instrument) with a bunch of original songs as well as great covers of classics
Shit rocks yo
Since Adolf would be to obvious, I'd nominate *another* fascist dictator of Austria, [Engelbert Dollfuß]
You can say he was a bad and dictatorial ruler, but insane
How do you justify that label
He wasn't insane in any clinical sense
He defiantly wasn't insane in any clinical sense
true, but I would still a prefere a nickname like Fairhair
Dude was only 1,51m tall lmao
I'd say every fascist is insane
Then the label is meaningless
Do we know what are facts and what ottoman propaganda
Pretty sure he didnt make a deal with the devil or smth
as long the infected people are outside and doors well shut
Well the Grasser Corruption case was in the media a lot
It took forever
That was banned in Switzerland
Just seems to discriminate poor people, without any real gain
I imagine there were fines for those who begged, which they couldn't have paid anyway
Also the Case of the Franz Fuchs
It's more famous because of his rants and paroles he shouted out during the process
>Just seems to discriminate poor people, without any real gain
A ton of "beggars" are actually begging for a crime organization and only get to keep a tiny amount of money
>social welfare that helps the poor
Of course, but tell me one place where that works perfectly
Begging should always be the last option, but to outlaw it just forces them into criminality
From where do they cross your border
That stuff would be as profitable in Germany/Austria etc
Why make the effort to get to Switzerland
The train ticket back home thing is just a scam
It's something, some beggars do here as well
I know a guy who needs a train ticket back home for about 10 years+ now
There are definitely easier places to smuggle people in to, I don't think Switzerland is the prime destination for that
Netherlands = bikes
Luxemburg = money
Belgium = waffles and chocolate
And I have a picture of the way cities look in Netherlands in my head
Not as a standalone, no
Ooooh I just grew more fond of Greek because it's a language where you can leave out the subject
I love that feature of Spanish and hate that German conjugates **and** needs subjects
To my knowledge, wel just means good
So you will most likely be able to use both just like you are able to say "good bye" or just "bye" in english
Edit: it also makes sense
In german you can also say "dank dir schön" (word by word translation: thank you well) and "dank euch schön" (thank you (plural) well)
But is mostly used in dialekts
[Not surprising in a world, where Pepsi once had the 6th largest navy that included 17 submarines, a cruiser, a frigate, and a destroyer
And then they sold the whole fleet to a Swedish company
Maybe they had a few too many interwar fighters
The "Königlich bayerische Greifenreiterkorp", of course
As an Austrian, I can't relate
We've read Faust (Goethe), Die Verwandlung (Kafka), Jugend ohne Gott (Horvath), Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum (Böll), Der Besuch der alten Dame (Dürrenmatt), Woyzeck (Büchner), Draußen vor der Tür (Borchert), Kein Platz für Idioten (Mitterer) and Die Leiden des jungen Werther (Goethe) among others
Additionally to general German works like Goethe, Schiller, Kafka, Mann ... we read Austrian literature like Grillparzer, the comedic plays of Nestroy and post war works of Thomas Bernhard, Jelinek etc
But there is also room for your own reading lists
I comprised myself one including 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World and wrote my final essay on SciFi dystopias
We also read an originally greek work "Antigone" in german class
Also a lot of plays - some from Nestroy, Schnitzler, Ödon von Horvath etc
I had to read most of them too
We also read "Die Schachnovelle" (Hesse) and "Die Physiker" (Dürrenmatt)
I really enjoyed reading most of them
Was ich mich noch erinnern kann (wahrscheinlich manche falsch geschrieben)
Die Nibelungen (Novelle)
Das Parfüm
Das Bildnis von Dorian Grey
Jackyll and Hide
Die Schachnovelle
Die Wolke
Ein paar österreichische Bücher, die längst nicht mehr in Erinnerung sind
Bahnhof Zoo (hab ich gehasst)
Tschick
Die Welle
Und ein paar zweite Weltkriegsliteratur
For me it was George Orwell and Shakespeare (Animal Farm,  Romeo and Julie, Macbeth)
Edit: British in Austria now; educated in England
I've read that too
I was so confused at first, because "Tschick" is an Austrian word for cigarette
In the book it's just a name for a character
We read and analysed each entire book
We read Macbeth in class - with individual parts read (played
) by individual students - and analysed it together as we went
Same but less intense for R&J. Animal Farm is more novel so we read a chapter between each lesson and then discussed
This was 1993-1995
Swiss Army knife
Moka pot
Glock 9mm
My violin and now
Proper fur lined winter coat
Hiking boots

Good question
Also I think it's hard to know what you'd actually miss without having had the experience of being abroad and really, really *missing* some things you know from home
Of course this is often really basic stuff or things that you can't really physically *take with you* per se, but I'll just call this list "what I can't live without" so that it fits the first part of the question:
-**easy access to wooded areas (forest etc)
** that means having to drive no less than 30 minutes to go somewhere where there's no people, just nature
would like to bring it if I could, or travel to places where it exists anyway
-**good drinkable tap water
** ooh boy, I miss it every time I go abroad
I even brought it with me on occasions, but sadly never more than the one bottle I fill at the airport after the security check
-**proper bread
** and by that I mean dark sourdough rye bread, none of that fluffy stuff or toast bread (we don't even call that bread; just *toast*. it's not bread if your teeth don't get a workout eating it
-**clean air
** missed it sorely in big cities in south east asia
hard to bring with, sadly
-**big bowl of salad or uncooked greens
** it's really rare in some countries to eat uncooked crunchy veggies
I start to crave it so hard after a few weeks, sadly never managed to bring it with me
-**sweet dishes as the main dish
** this is more a piece of culture than an actual meal, but one I'm really fond of
I've actually brought relevant ready-made meals or ingredients (like [Germknödel] [Mohnnudeln] [Kaiserschmarrn] with me to show them to friends
-**cozy relaxed dinners with friends
** at home, going out for dinner normally means that we'll stay at the restaurant after dinner, have a drink, talk and in general have a good time
and while I can accept that things work differently somewhere else, and people might just eat and then continue on to their next destination for the evening, I really really miss just staying where you are, relaxing and enjoying each other's company
I'd say I manage to do this by bringing **my friends** with me though
And thinking about the second part of the question, a list of more things I actually like to physically *bring* on my travels (and excluding basic things like electronics, standard clothes or toiletries because that's gonna be the same for everybody anyway), I can think of the following:
-**proper leather hiking boots
** yeah I know ultralight approach shoes are super popular right now
I also use them on hot summer hikes in the flatland
but there's just something about [proper handmade leather shoes] the ones that you put wax on once a year to make them near indestructible, and you own for ten years or longer with just needing to resole them from time to time
the leather conforms to your foot over time and makes them fit like a pair of gloves, and also makes for a much better foot climate than crappy plastic shoes as well
-**certain toiletries
** we like what we are used to I guess, and there's this specific brand of shower gel and tooth paste that I really like and could never find anywhere else, so I normally bring it
the tooth paste is actually light red and tastes salty
-**standard bag of medicine
** same with medicine; when you're sick and stuck in some seedy hostel where everything's weird and unknown, there's something really comforting about just taking what you know (like a bag of Neocitran) and feeling like you're properly taking care of yourself
-**proper electrical plug or adapter**. and by proper I mean type F, long live the Schuko
no but really, I honestly miss those when going abroad and having to deal with the other variants that are all either too flimsy or humongous
-**bike
** yeah I wish I could take this more often
-**barefoot shoes
** one more shoe category
I just really like walking in them
2 or 3 of my favourite Freitag bags, Kaweco travel pen, notebook, kindle, the watch my husband gave me, favourite lipstick, favourite earrings, cinnamon mints
>šajtrga (Scheibtruhe : samokolnica)
Do you know "kajola"? Thats what we say in southern Carinthia and it supposedly comes from Slovenian
They're not mutually exclusive
Well, there's another German speaking country between you
Italy is closer to Austria you know
Würstel / Wirschtl is normal here
When i was a kid i always wondered what a "Palat" is and what ham has to do with crepé. Now i know better ty
Schraubn or Schraufn in Carinthia
Germans use it aswell
Not common, but also not super rare
And nobody cares about them
Not so common
View of the society Imho changed, in the 90's and early 2000's it wasn't really viewed good by the majority
Nowadays most really don't care
I mean I’ve had long hair and most people don’t care
Some elders may look funny or think that you are a girl (maybe they have bad eye sight)
You know what's even more practical
Short hair
Get a haircut you hippie
No just kidding, kind of
But looking good and well groomed with long hair is definitely more work than with short hair, talking from my own experience
Gottesanbeterin - woman that is praying to god, (female) worshiper of god
Yes praying mantises are specifically female here, even the males get called Gottesanbeter*in,* which is weird now that I think of it
Same in German
"Gottesanbeterin"
Has to be "I am from Austria" from Rainhard Fendrich
Everyone knows it and sings along when it's played at any public gathering
I would say nowadays its Parov Stellar, at least in the electronic genre
Other than classical music,
[Rock Me Amadeus - Falco] and [Egoist - Falco] are two I think are pretty known globally
Nah
It would be Mozart, Falco, *Live is Life*.
Italy has a shitton of classical music everyone instantly recognizes (maybe not by the name but by the music), e.g.:
La Traviata - Libiamo ne' lieti calici
Il barbiere di Siviglia - Overture and Fígaro
Nabucco - Và Pensiero
The Four Seasons - Winter
Aida - Triumphal March
Dies Irae (Verdi)
Adagio in G after Albinoni
Ponchielli - Dance of the Hours
O Sole Mio by Eduardo di Capua
Boccherini's Minuet
the four notes from Beethoven's 5th or Wagner's Bridal Chorus are probably even more recognizable
or Life is Life by Opus
Oh, I misread the question, I thought it meant in my own country, my bad
Of course more people know Falco outside of Austria
Little Germany
Anything to do with Germany
Also, that the empire was small
Hahaha, I kind of expected this one to be top comment
"You're just like Germans right, just a bit slower and less tidy
I met one guy hitting on me and telling me he is from Slovakia and I asked him about it, you know small talk style, and I noticed he always used Slovenian as an adjective to Slovakia
I was super confused and at some point I told him straightaway to tell me where he is actually from - turned out he was from Chechnya and was ashamed about that
Because Austria lost against Prussia in 1866
Are you from bavaria or baden würtenberg
:D no, I married a way creepier guy
We didn't do nearly enough
Some were imprisoned and so on, but Denazification was a lot better in Germany
"Oh noes we were the first victims we didn't do anything".
Sadly really badly
See Waldheim affair as an example
Hey
We didn't do nothing
People who were a bigger deal in the Wehrmacht or SS weren't allowed to join the military
Hence our general defense plan against a Soviet invasion was developed by a civilian consultant (who formerly was a prominent member of the OKH I think)
...okay we did nothing
I don't think so but I don't know
Our defense plan is just a less effective version of the swiss plan tbh
> developed by a civilian consultant
[a pattern emerges] ;)
Nobody ever claimed Beethoven was Austrian though
Also birth place means nothing
doesn't make it less bullshit though
You can continue to add stuff, still does not change the truth
I'm not upset about anything, you are just babbling along unrelated things, that's all
All of them
That is an excellent question
No idea
Not *that* many I think
I'll try to recollect:
In Upper Austria I've been to the Schaumburg ruin, Clam, Altpernstein (I've slept there numerous times), Leonstein ruins, Schloss Klaus (I've slept there too; originally it was a castle), Schloss Linz (also used to be a castle, and used to be even a Roman *castrum*, and before that a Celtic one), various of the fortification towers around Linz, Bergschlössl Linz (I used to go there with my friends to drink beer), Schloss Freistadt, Kaiservilla Bad Ischl (if you wanna count that), Schloss Puchberg Wels, and a bunch of others I can't remember the name or the exact location of
Other Austrian states: Dürnstein ruin, the historicist Franzensburg in Laxenburg (if you wanna count that), Perchtoldsdorf, Landskron by the Lake Ossiach, Hohensalzburg, Hofburg in Vienna (yes it's a palace, but it's at the same time a castle and originally it very much fulfilled the purpose of a castle), Schlossberg in Graz
Other countries: Bratislava, Prague, Cesky Krumlov, Cracovia, Buda, London, Stuttgart (more of a palace really), Madrid de los Austrias (I guess
), Alhambra in Granada, Xativa, the gate towers of Valencia (they kinda castle-like), Alcazar in Cordoba, Alcazar in Sevilla, that old castel thing on the hill in Malaga, batteries on the Rock of Gibraltar, Castillo de Almodovar del Rio, Castillo de Javier in Navarra, Palacio Real de Olite in Navarra, Uxue in Navarra, Castillo de Carlos V. in Hondarribia, the castle on Urgull in Donostia, Castel Sant'Angelo, the Vatican, I think there used to be a bunch of palaces on the Palatin Hill (thus the name *palace*) and I've been there, some place close to Verona, Akkon, Knossos, some other place on Crete, some place on Kos, some place on Corfu, some place in Girona (?), some place in Barcelona (?), Limassol,  and probably a bunch of others
Lots
And then some more
The difference between palace and castle is often not very clear cut, since many old castles (in the sense of miliarty fortifications), later were trasnformed into palaces
Take the Hofburg in Vienna for example
It's a huge rennaissance, baroque and historicist palace complex, but at its core there is a medieval castle, that originally had very much the purpose of a military fortification
13th/14th month of salary (with additional tax benefit)
up to 2 years of maternity leave (fathers can consume part of it instead of mothers)
comprehensive medicare for all employees
Those are just some of the basic ones every employee gets regardless of what you do
Some industries have venefits of their own and espexially start-ups are developing good incentives like 30hour weeks on full salary
Austria is pretty cool like that
I get a phone for personal use from work (it's not declared as a work phone but as a goody and I can choose to pick up or not and can't be forced to carry it with me) and working for an ISP and phone company there's no limits regarding voice/data use in Austria and quite generous limits in Europe + I can use 2 complementary products (the portfolio includes Spotify Premium, mobile TV, newspaper epaper, movie theatre rebates, 200mins of telephony in a country of my choice and a couple more) for free
Of course other products of the company are available for way cheaper as employee
Lunch is subsidized, a 3 course meal of totally acceptable quality is around 3
Company pays for the metro ticket or offers you a parking spot
They finance 2 company football, a volleyball and some other employee sports team, as well as vouchers for a tennis court iirc, they offer on campus massages and shiatsu for like 10€/30mins
There's furthermore a couple of healthcare benefits I haven't looked into because frankly I haven't needed it yet, the option to have lunch with the CEO on your birthday (which is kinda fun truth to be told), an extra paid vacation day a year, child daycare, and some other minor stuff I don't recall
Oh, and you can use the mail department for receiving personal packages although they are telling you they won't accept the 85" TV you ordered off Amazon (but from experience of a colleague they're fine with ~50" TVs
) but considering the performance of DHL & FedEx in my area that's very convenient
Overall I think it's not too special but I can't complain
There is a joke in Austria about that, that nobody here will find funny, but anyway
What city has AEIOU in its name
Laeioum
Actually the city is called Leoben, but in the ridiculous local dialect, people say it like that
Do names count
The Dame *Aiuóla* of the fantasy story *Neverending Story*
(Yes the ó is in there even in the German version)
&#x200B;
Otherwise, maybe Mietauto (rental car)
> and sometimes y, which can act as both vowel and consonant
When is y a consonant in German, not counting English loan words
As far as I can tell it's always pronounced as i or ü, or something in between those two
At least in German place names that is always the case
Sylt, Pyhrn, Steyr, Weyer, Speyer, Schwyz ...
> estadounidense
Also, that one has 3 Es
Ideally you have each vowel only once
~~I didn‘t know Laeioum is a universal Austrian pronounciation but I‘ll gladly accept this reality~~
> What city has AEIOU in its name
Laeioum
That's hilarious
Gotta remember that one
>  Heizölrückstoßabdämpfung
Nice
No idea if that even actually exists, but a nice word nevertheless
Exactly
The pronoun, in this case ei/ele oleiau, is (like in Italian) optional and mainly used when you need to avoid a confusion in the sentence
True, didn't think about good ol' Yacht
Never seen anyone drunkenly sing at any point anywhere
I don't hang with crowds like that
*laughs in Austrian* what colonies
Absolutely - at least for the older generations
The heavy accents of *German West Hungary* are a pain to understand ;)
Wos moanstn hiatz domit
Eure Kolonie
Wappler oida
The balkan was where our "colonies" were
But our language didn't spread there
Some words did
I've seen a number of words from Serbian or Polish that look like German words phonetically spelled in Viennese dialect
It's either 1866 and Austria's end of German hegemony after losing the war to Russia, the civil war in 1934 or the time after WW2 with a distinctive non-German identity and the eternal neutrality associated with it in our 1955 state treaty
For Austria I'd say it's both world wars
But for my region in particular it would be the Tyrolean Rebellion against the bavarian and french troops in 1809
Obviously WW1 did more damage to my region as we were split in two parts but the rebellion is very much what defines and unites the people of north and south tyrol to this day
WW2 too
Austria has had a long history and many changes
But if we are talking about how modern Austria got it's identity it was the aftermath of WW2
You see Austria was in a bad spot after WW1
We lost most of our land,economy and all of our prestige and power
So it started a huge movement where Austria wanted to be apart of Germany and viewed themselves as Germans
(I am of the opinion that Austrians are as much Germans as Irish are British, Austria had been independent for many centuries at that point, never was apart of Prussia or the German Empire and, until recently, was a Great Power of its own)
But the Peace Treaties and general politics after WW2 forever entrenched the idea of Austrians being Austrians and not Germans
Then the eventual "Staatsvertrag" (National Treaty) of 1955 cemented Austrias "everlasting Neutrality" (that was how it was officially called btw) and future political endeavours
Staying out of the Warsaw Pact and Nato, givigng Austria the rare oppertunity to trade with both sides
Albeit Austria stayed western-oriented
&#x200B;
Nowadays we mostly hang back and don't really do much politically outside of hosting international organizations or treaties
Or local politics with our neighbors
Dont forget the battle for Vienna
> secular republic
Is this still the case, not in theory but actually
Eh, it was one of the bricks that build up to today
But Austrias identity doesn't really have anything to do with the Battle of Vienna
Yeah autocorrect
It was rather small
But the time between the burning of the palace of justice in 1927 and the transformation into a dictatorship 1934 was a wild ride
It lasted 2 days or something
My bad
Sauerkraut
I never liked it and can barely get that garbste down my throat
Beuschl (a stew made from innards) is absolutely vile
Already made my own comment, but omg same
Krautsalat is wonderful and tasty, but Sauerkraut tastes like unwashed moldy socks
The Krampus thing
Where do you get free buckets
What else are you going to look at tho
Can't just ignore everyone
Which Krampus thing
The one were drunk people try to pull each other over a table and beat each other other while wearing a Krampus costume, or the regular thing where drunk people only beat each other up in Krampus costumes
Meh, around here in Middle Europe people wouldn't give a fuck either
We have kids dressing up as a black guy (one of the three wise men) every year for after-Christmas celebrations (6th of January)
It's not offensive in the slightest, just a tradition
Kinda like in India
What are you, an Anarchist
Hellweg sometimes has free buckets too
Huh, I don't know
[The former] variation is only practiced in Osttirol afaik
The thing with the tables starts around min 2:22
When I did Erasmus and met on a weekday with my group of friends from all kinds of European countries, I realized how more alcohol I usually consumed than anybody else
Like, I drank 3 (small) beers  while others only 1
In Austria however, I often consume less than most of my friends
Made me really think about our drinking culture
That's the trick tho
You can look at people while pretending to look out of the window
You are right, its a thing in Germany as well
But Southern Germany
> But since Bavaria is more Austrian than German
Take that back
Du rüttelst am Watschenbaum, ~~Saupreiß~~ lieber nördlicher Stiefcousin
Our kangaroos for our people
Do you mean
*A backl watschen san glei aufgrissn
Can't even speak the dialect named after your state properly, unbelievable :p
Well Salzburger (and Upper Austrians to a lesser degree), who are Bavarian in all but name are included in /r/aeiou after all
Many, all for different topics
[There‘s actually a website] where you can see all of the museums in Austria
I apologize in advance that I‘m listing so many
I chose 4 for Vienna, and 2 in Salzburg along wit 2 in Styria
If there are any Austrians here, they should feel free to add more that are either in their home state or also well known
So here are the ones I think are pretty significant:
Vienna:
* [The Hofburg] (the former home of the Habsburg family, currently our president lives there and all of our political debates are in it, but it‘s also classified as a museum)
* [The Kunsthistorisches Museum] (Museum of Fine Arts or literally translated: Museum of Art History)
* [Schloss Belvedere, specifically Upper Belvedere] or more specifically: [The Österreichische Galerie Belvedere] And wikipedia can explain why I chose it better than I can: _The Belvedere's art collection presents an almost complete overview of the development of art in Austria and, thus, an insight into the country's history
The world's largest collection of Gustav Klimt's paintings lies at the heart of the presentation of Art around 1900, on show at the Upper Belvedere
* [Schloss Schönbrunn] - A really beautiful castle and former summer residence of the Habsburg family
With it comes a beautiful Tiergarten (zoo) in the gardens of the castle - which is by the way the oldest zoo in the world and has the first naturally bred panda baby born in captivity in Europe
Salzburg:
* [Keltenmuseum] - I was there actually and it was damn amazing
I was in Hallstatt too, where you can go into the salt mines
All of it was so interesting
* [Bergbau- und Gotikmuseum (Mining and Gothic museum)] - Ijust think stuff like Gothic and all of that is very interesting
Also, this collection is unique throughout europe
Styria:
* [Universalmuseum Joanneum] - Fun Fact by Wikipedia: _It is the oldest museum in Austria as well as the largest universal museum in central Europe with over 4
5 million objects in 13 departments and 12 locations in the Styrian cities of Graz, Stainz, Trautenfels, and Wagna (Flavia Solva)
* [Admont Abbey (Stift Admont)] - Fun Fact by Wikipedia: _Admont Abbey contains the largest monastic library in the world as well as a long-established scientific collection
It is known for its Baroque architecture, art, and manuscripts
My absolute favorite in Denmark was den gamle by
Aros in Aarhus is also cool
Wennst vor jedem Stern einen doppelten Absatz machen würdest, hättst eine wunderschöne Liste
Also, I'd add the Ars Electronica in Linz
Damn, universalmuseum joanneum is the biggest in Austria AND Central Europe
I've been there once and wasn't blown away
I guess I didn't see all departments or something
The Kunsthistorische & Naturhistorische in Vienna seem so much bigger
Edit: German wikipedia says that the Kunstistorische (museum of art history) is bigger
In Vienna: Naturhistorisches Museum, Technisches Museum, Schatzkammer, Foltermuseum, Narrenturm, Haus der Musik, ZOOM Kindermuseum, etc
Then I know that Swarovski Kristallwelten and the Brotmuseum
Trying my best, formatting on mobile is an absolute pain in the ass /:
Probably because the 4 locations are counted as one
Edit: also idk if it‘s the biggest, it‘s just one of the biggest in central europe and the oldest in austria
I think they wanted to expand but there are still only 8 in Austria and half of them in Vienna
Never have been in one tbh
There are 8 of them in the country, 5 of them are in Vienna
As a non-viennese I never had KFC
There are 8 in the whole of Austria
And not a single one in the west where I live
So if wanted to go to a KFC it would be shorter for me to go into another country cause I live closer to the KFC in Munich than to every other KFC in Austria
I didnt even know we had one
But honestly, why get KFC when you could have styrian backhendlsalat instead
We have two (I think) here around Linz and I don´t think they get that much business
In the end I think they are just way too expensive for what they offer
I didn't even know there was that many
I thought it was like 4 overall 2 in vienna, one in Innsbruck and a last one somewhere else, Salzburg maybe
There is no KFC in Ibk, There are 5 in vienna, 1 in Linz, 1 in Graz and 1 in Ansfelden
[Source]
There's one in linz
How have i never noticed that one even though I'm in linz pretty often
I don't know, I'm hardly ever in Linz
But since there is also a leberkas pepi in linz I don't think I would ever even think about going to KFC
I’ve had KFC in Romania, Austria, Germany, Czechia and Slovakia (haven’t been to Poland yet, nor to the US)
But my foreign friends and me agree the romanian one it’s vastly superior in taste than any other we’ve tasted
I can’t explain why, but I’m assuming in Poland it’s the same
I live in Austria now, but I hardly ever go to KFC because it’s just soo bad
Whenever I go back home, waiting in a big line for KFC is always on my bucket list (pun intended)
McDonald’s is considerably better in Austria though
It‘s very probable
A lot of eastern european franchises are polish-owned
Now you can add one more thing on your to do list when you go to Romania
I sure added the KFCs for Poland
Don‘t forget to order the Glenn garlic sauce
It‘s an experience in itself
Beware though that sometimes KFC has meh days
Food’s still better than in the west, but it‘s not amazing as usual
But don‘t limit yourself to chicken wings, Romania has a lot of other good things to offer ;)
That‘s actually a good point
Afaik prices in Poland and Romania are equally low
Even our currencies the złoty and the leu are almost 1:1 in parity
Exactly the same here, although I don't have any hard numbers to support my impression
But I have the same feeling (and I think it's like that among my family, families I know and circle of friends) just like you said
What counts as "being able to cook"? Like ... what level are we talking about
Wennst ned krandln konnst findsd en Lebtog long kan monn, so yes
> Fresh meals are healthier and cheaper than takeaway
so takeaways aren't fresh meals in your opinion
I've got several restaurants in my area that have takeout that is much better than what most people could cook themselves and it's "healthy" food
>  full English breakfasts, Spaghetti Bolognese, various meals with Chicken and rice or chicken and potatoes etc, made fried chicken and fish and chips and burgers during the lockdown too, homemade pizzas etc
That doesn't sound too basic
Not sure about the part about the men
Men do cook waaay more than it was common in earlier times but I wouldn't say that men are usually cooking more advanced than women
That being said from my point of view it is absolutely true that cooking becomes less important
I don't know a single person who likes to cook, everybody I know is eating no breakfast or something cold, eats lunch at work and then eats bread for dinner at home
At the weekend they eat out
I have a DINK couple as friends, they use their kitchen about once a month
And thats not even the typical "I am like that so my friends are like that too" situation
I personally cook and bake a lot
But I think it is not that easy to find Austrians that cook dishes from scratch
My foreign husband realized that at some point and he thinks it is really weird how little Austrians cook in general and when I am abroad (of course not when I am just a tourist) I notice it too
> Till the 90s the "traditional norm" was for a women to cook for the family and pretty much expected
Yes, except if it comes down to BBQ, men did that while women prepared the salads
In my family my mother cooked most of the time, but my dad made the Schnitzel
In my experience, it's like the society has shifted into 2 groups - people who cook and those who don't, very much like people who read and those who don't.
You sound like a peach
Dear readers: Cooking and experimenting with new reipes and types of food is a very common thing among women and men in Austria (equally in my experience), enjoyed by many, countryfolk and city folk alike
Cooking and baking some nice treat when friends of family are over is widespread, basic cooking skills are taught in school, girls and boys equally
As you (probably) know, eating is a **serious** past-time here and we have a huge variety from Corinthian Kasnudeln, Lower Austrian Mohntorte to classic Viennese Schnitzel, Influenced by the former countries of the Austrian Empire all the way up to to Asian Cuisine
When I was a student, making marmelade was a really big trend among my fellow Uni peers (and is ofc still today), today making your own sausage and curing meat seems to be the latest trend with the young hip crowd
For example, a couple of weeks ago, the volunteers (high school age) on night shift at our local EMT station point baked several cakes for the staff when the calls were down, just because they could
Which was super lovely of them
I have rarely met anyone in Austria who hasn't had at least average cooking skills
> selling all kinds of premade packs of herbs and spices for specific meals that require minimal thinking from the one who prepares the food
If you are only cooking occasionally (and only for one person) these premade packs make a lot of sense, if it comes down to things that can go bad
I'd rather buy something that is measured out to be the amount you need for a portion than throwing away stuff I don't need
We used to have it, but it was removed in the 80s or 90s I think
I also don't think it's necassary in the age of the internet, where instructions for any dishes or techniques are available online
>I don't know a single person who likes to cook, everybody I know is  eating no breakfast or something cold, eats lunch at work and then eats  bread for dinner at home
What the fuck kind of weird social circle do you both have, lol
You have no aunt or friend or neighbour who cooks like
normal people
Your Mama and Oma don't cook and bake
And I even googled that if anyone did a study on how much Austrians cook at home
[Unsuprisingly alot] which alligns with the emphasis on things like wide-available orgainc meat and vegetables, local (regional) products, the popularity of having your own vegetable garden, the tons of country cooking magazines and books, that you couldn't buy a single cube of yeast for weeks while quarantaine, because everyone was baking like galore
and everything else what I always considered normal here
I think that's a level that most people manage and is kinda expected
Lebtog bedeutet das ganze Leben lang
On the countryside it‘s still common in middle schools to teach cooking and housekeeping
Here in the US most restaurants have a take out option and there are a lot of healthy options, at least here in California
And well even if it's not healthy on an absolute scale, I don't see how the food from a restaurant would be necessarily less healthy than the same dish made at home
But that statement about the UK fascinates me
Indian food is big there and there are definitely Indian dishes you can fit in a healthy diet
Or do they not offer take-out
Well, I dont know my neighbors - otherwise no family or friends who *really* cook
Of course sometimes they are cutting some mushrooms into the pasta sauce or they are frying meat and then they eat it with some french fries from the freezer section, etc
Once in a while they maybe cook a soup or a rice pan (if you can say it like that in English
But regular cooking
That is a very uncommon thing here imho
Especially if you compare it with other nations where it is normal to eat every day a self made meal in the evening, maybe even with a self made soup or salad or combined with left-overs from the previous day
Like I said, I dont know any Austrian who does that
Cooking is only a hobby in Austria
> I know very little women who are able to cook advanced meals (cooking  noodles and throwing in a can of tuna or making an omelette is not  cooking in my book)
It's mainly men not only knowing how to cook but  wanting it, trying out new things and so on
That's what you said
Also, then you are talking from a very individual experience, because in my social circle (VERY big family, located all over Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol and Vienna) as well among my work peers (medical field) and my friends and aquaintances, average is the standard and advanced at least a hobby
I know nobody whose standard meal is "Mikrowelle und Kebap".
Where do you live
I know alot of Austrians who do that
I do that
My Mom does that, my friends do that, the ones with kids alot, my aunts do that, my neighbors do that
the weird lady who sits the entrance at my workplace and who lives with six cat brings her homemade casseroles in a Tupperwear box
I mean she told me she shares the plate with her cats, which is insane, but she throws that ones together herself
You mom never cooked or baked whatever is typical for the federal state you grew up, or Austria
No fish and game, which is just delicious
No homemade Rindssuppe, where you eat the beef cold cutted
Nix Strudel und Weihnachtskekse
No big family gatherings where it's Oma kocht + pot-luck style dishes from the rest of the family/relatives
Nothing of that
Lol that's sad
On the other hand I definitely also know people who would burn water
Strange, my go-to indian restaurant here has quite a lot of option that I would consider on the healthy side
Their aloo gobi is amazing
I live in Styria and I am in my mid-thirties, so I know lots of families too
And of course there are people who *occasionally* cook or bake
Like I said, it is a hobby and some people like it
I do not know a single Austrian person - my mother included - who cooks really regularly, if they are in the mood for it or not
And therefore I don't know anybody who thinks cooking is an important and basic life skill
No, I have no idea, because that never happened to me nor did I experience that -  when my 12yr old cousin invites her school friends over to hang out, they often cook or bake something they found on social media or YT, just for fun
And I am not a lucky person, I am a average person with average experiences
We're the same age and I live in Lower Austria, close to Vienna
Weird then;)
Well, I am glad it is totally different in my family and among my social circle, because I love trying out new culinary things, inviting friends and being invited, high quality ingredients and all the joyfull, gmiadliche package
And my mom cooks six days out of seven and even her Restl dishes (left-overs) are delicious:D
And I do honestly think it's a bit of typical Austrian "sudern" involved here, because there's a pattern with you and the other poster: Both of you say "Austrians can't cook", EXCEPT you both (that other dude included also his friends and granny, but no girls lol), who are indeed Austrian, and claim to love advanced cooking/cooking and baking alot ...;)
I actually never said I love cooking :D not a big fan, but I find it necessary
But this kinda proofs my point:  in Austria typically only people who are into cooking cook regularly
I said I cook a lot and you assumed I must love it then :)
Pity you don’t do then:) Maybe we should also add it’s also a Family Background thing: I grew up with a mom who was food-concerned and cooked meals for us everyday and the big family gatherings, like at Christmas, were and are joyfully full of great homecooked treats
it’s a thing you take into adulthood
It was the standard with my family and also with my schoolmates families
I do see that not everyone has that
Croatia and, to a lesser degree, Poland
AUT - FR, NL, LUX - BEL in some way too - DNK
Scheanan cake day
Man
It's lonely
&nbsp;
^(my goodness, that should be their new official tourist slogan)
Mainly because of Silesia which I kind of view as a "next door"-region to Austria
You might thank Sobieski for that
There's many descendents from Galicians in Vienna
You can still see the cultural ties with last names and cuisine for instance
Why in the way
Our southern most province is never in the way
Now go to sleep lower styria
You're just the slavizised Austrians to our austrianized Slavs
see it more like, in the middle
you're only not mentioned because of the "no common borders" requirement in the question, mountain brothers
And Austria did not exist after WW2 - so guess it does not feel the same anymore :D
Nah
Sobieski isnt that important for that
Its the influx of many Polish and historically many Polish Jews that seriously left their mark in local culture eg in Vienna
I at first really had to think what you even mean by that
And I don‘t think it‘s a thing in Austria, sure everything is christmas themed, but it usually isn‘t a traditional or national thing
I‘m not sure tho, so it would be nice if another Austrian could confirm or deny that
Btw merry christmas in advance to anybody reading this
Hope all of you have been staying healthy and that your christmas and new year will be awesome (:
Can't tell
I was too young to remember
Was in Berlin with my class last year
We were at the "S-Bahn" station and a teacher lost his second trousers on the tracks
He jumped off and took them back
I know it's dangerous but we all found that funny at that moment and the people where like "Those teens are weird and the teacher isnt a good role model"
I don't know why but I like to watch the people there
I was in Sarvar several times and it's kind of calming to see the people there
Don't know why
They don't get that much salary as we do (No, I don't mass shop in Hungary because it's cheaper there for us)
Visited Etna
It was my first time exploring a Vulcano
I love Vulcanoes and I was like "OMG I'm gonna see a Vulcanoe" And it also was my first time on an island
Visited Winkelgasse
But I also visited a bit of the beautiful Scottish landscape and a Loch (I think it was Mormond but I'm not sure)
(Had the accommodation in Edinburgh near the sea :3)
Breathtaking xD
The longest Rodelbahn :D
If you need the name it's Zinkenstüberl ^^
The first time I come to a city I always take a day to just walk around as randomly as I can without ever looking at a map
Can only recommend it
Sometimes you end up admiring the posh area with all the embassies and sometimes you end up in a pub in a weird area with locals who speak very little English
Good times
Just read up on him, how lucky us Austrians have no connection to him whatsoever
Vorarlberg once wanted to join Switzerland but Switzerland doesn't want them
Otherwise there simply are not separatist movements
Is it a secessionist movement if the other parts of Austria want to sell burgenland
Probably Vorarlberg to join Switzerland cause they share the same dialect and actually tried once
Alternatively, Burgenland or Kärnten
mostly because we would sell them to Hungary and Slovenia respectively
I think they should join Austria, together with southern tyrol
I mean there isn't really that much left of Austria
Who knows, maybe they regularily even try to do it now too, but it's just that nobody in the rest of Austria understands them
They should try Liechtenstein, maybe they want them
Remember the time back in 2012 when a small island of Greece wanted to become a part of Austria
That would have been weird
[Article] (in German)
We were kinda seperated from 95% of our land already
But where would we keep our Burgen
also south tyrol
Time to take back Hungary so we can also have seperatist movements
"The rest is Austria"
There's plenty of cellar space in lower austria
You can have both
A half eaten fleischkassemml and a six pack of the cheapest beer you can find, as well as the fact that slovakia with burgenland sticking out of it would look hilarious on a map
Shhhhh
Taking the first numbers that come up in Google - Germany has a gdp of 3
8 trillion
Bavara a gdp of 600 billion and BaWü of 500 billion
Jesus, that map would look disgusting
There are no stray dogs in Austria afaik
I also remember the super surprised look on a Romanian exchange student when she asked what is being done about stray dogs in Austria and I told her that there are none
In Austria too, we started writing practice with pencils and then switched to fountain pens
After I'd moved on from elementary school, teachers didn't care anymore so most of us switched to regular pens within a couple years
Granted tho, that was 20 years ago
I don't know whether this is still relevant nowadays
The problem is the ink
Writing right to left, your hand will smear the ink when you write with the left hand
Here it is the same
The only parents where from the birthday child
Some Parents Like to stay, some Parents Bring only the kids, both is Welcome at my Home
My Kids are small enough that the Garden is fun enough to Entertain them without additional Input, I Just watch over No Body gets hurt
I had 2 parents stay once for my kid's party
It was ... awkward
> I have a bonus question: is it common in other countries to have one “kid birthday” with friends as described in this post and then another “adult birthday”/“family birthday” with family
Yes
Very common
Most of us wouldn't even have the space to host that many kids
We live in the capital, right in the center
Kid went out on her own (with her friends, but without adults) since she was around 9 or 10
It's really like how safe it is here
I suppose it's only a problem for classic suburbia or in big car dependent cities
Not really too much
It is part of some Austrian literature and depends heavily on the German teacher
There is some emphasis on Austrian standard German in distinction to the German standard German  (which colloqially is called Bundesdeutsch) - iE not using the Duden but a distinct Austrian dictionary in school
Dialects though are a central part of local culture both in every day life, music, theatre ....
"Das österreichische Wörterbuch". It is distinct in that it uses Austrian words and gramatical versions that are unique to Austria
iE Singular/Plural and form of file
In Austria it is der Akt/die Akte in German it is die Akte/die Akten
Leberkassemmerl, Bifana and Kebab
Leberkassemmel mit Gurkerl
Mustard, soft cheese, capers and sliced picled onions
Preferably in dark rye bread
Or just a Leberkassemmerl
Leberkassemmel has been mentioned here before
What I personally love to prepare for myself is a sandwich which is built like this:
- Tramezzini bread with a thin layer of mayonaise
- chili flakes
- salami calabrese (spianata calabra to be exact)
- gouda (just normal, young one, the cheese shouldn´t be too dominant in taste in this sandwich imo)
- pickles (essiggurkerl, bevorzugt scharfe) (just make sure to drain the liquid with kitchenpaper before you put them in)
- and then the same stuff again backwards
[this one] from syracuse
([second video] faster but worse picture quality)
keep watching until the omelette part at the end
Kaiser roll, butter, raw sliced onions, thinly sliced smoked salmon
Done
Leberkassemmerl ftw
(und als Linzer: Am liebsten vom Leberkaspepi
Oh, it is senor
[Here is some local folklore about it
] <3
Sure, there’s also Kasleberkassemmerl and Pferdeleberkassemmerl (my personal favorite, because horse meat is great)
Search for the word in /r/Austria and there are quite a few posts
Hab in Wien a nu koane guadn gfundn
Oba in Portugal war‘s guad
Well, yes
A Döner Kebab (or just Kebab for short in German)
It's basically very finely ground sausage meat in loaf form, baked in the oven, cut into slices and put in a Kaiserroll
You can get this hot in most grocery stores, many bakeries, butchers etc
as a to go meal or, if you are that hungry, to eat in the store while you shop
But the taste is seriously addicting IMHO
Sure, there are differences in taste depending on brand, but while I like some less than others, I've never met a Leberkäse I didn't want to eat
The taste is not really that similar to regular sausage
I don't know what exactly they do with it to make it taste so good but I suspect lard is involved
The name is a bit misleading
Translated it means livercheese, but it contains neither liver nor cheese
There are variants that do contain cheese but they are called Käsleberkäse (cheeslivercheese)
Apparently the liver part of the word is from a word meaning leftovers and the cheese part refers to the loaf shape
It's leberkäse or leberkas - semmel means breadroll
I haven't heard that song in ages
Aaah, the song of my people
reminds me of [this one]
I would rather compare it to a slightly fattier and softer/spongier Frankfurter/Wiener sausage in serious formats (a full block of Leberkäse has a few kg and about the size of a packaged sliced square sandwich bread)
Maybe also a bit like [this song about Schnitzl]
„Benutzername prüft aus“ darad ma drüman auf /r/de jiatzad song
It’s not in German
Frankfurters are made from finely ground sausage meat :)
It's all Brät - ground meat, but the texture depends on how fine or coarse it's ground and also how fatty/lean the meat is

I guess it is that the last government got suspended and the so called “expert government” is the first in years to actually make wise decisions
The conservative party (whom I personally dislike more than the far-right) under Sebastian "Ohrban" Kurz is having some fuckups that might influence the election result in September
They are still projected to gain, so I'm not holding my breath
IIRC the EU already banned plastic bags starting somewhere in the 2020s.
sadly that will end way too soon
and one of the biggest asshats is finally out of the game which is also nice
>might influence the election result in September
Don't kid yourself
Their target group believed every ridiculous spin on such news stories so far and most of them are older, so may not even know what a hard drive is
Stand up comedy, that is
I am sure he will return somehow, they always find ways
Logic and facts at work
Because with the far-right I think many at least genuinely care for the future of their countries and Europe
With the current conservatives I never have that feeling
They literally have no reason to exist other than make politics for themselves and their wealthy backers (i.e. "the rich", cliche as it may sound)
Much moreso than the far-right, they stand for erosion of the middle class, dismantling the welfare state, and privatisation
They are literallly *the* enemy of the common people, in my opinion anyway
"Er ist wieder da"
>Because with the far-right I think many at least genuinely care for the future of their countries and Europe
Lol
It's been, like, 2 months since Ibiza
Of course some of the policies he is pushing for more less reality in Europe but overall I think he is still a fair bit more left than most European politicians
I haven't heard of them gaining any political relevance
Taking a look at their website, at first glance their party program actually looks pretty reasonable (apart from the obvious, ridiculous pipe dream of Habsburg restoration)
I would unironcially be in favour of restoring the monarchy if there was a real chance, but that ship has sailed forever
Calling yourself a socialist=/=being a socialist
Austria is a republic because after the fall of the Habsburgs and being forbidden to join Germany, there really weren't many other options
The proclamation of the republic was a "guess we're doing that now" type situation
But in my opinion the mentality of Austrians is very much still "monarchist", even if they don't consciously realize it
We like to suck up to authority and stick to a "traditional order".
If it would magically happen with a nice job and everything, then Switzerland
Just for fun
I'd probably prefer Switzerland as a country in general but I could imagine myself living in Hamburg or Leipzig
I wouldn't mind to move abroad for a while to work
But with these options I would stay in Vienna
I love that city
Germany, Altschauerberg
I'd stay in Vienna, why would I move
If I had to choose another place, I'd probably go to Hamburg
For a moment I thought this was a dig at Swiss German, then I remembered
riiight, *French*.
The "hate" thing isn't that much better in Vienna, even though I'm not sure that I'd call it hate
I mean in sports we usually cheer for the team Germany plays against and you might get some weird looks for using words like "Quark" or Schorle", but mostly it isn't meant completely serious
The only thing we're not joking about is sauce on schnitzel
I mean, I'd say most of us are closer to the sea than most Germans
A so a bledsinn, mi vastead awoi jeda
Where have you been, if I may ask
Slovenian is even an official minority language here, so you get a translator if you need one
They've got a very large Portuguese community in Switzerland though
Mh, after over 30 years something new would be fun
Altough living right next to Slovenia rocks of course :D
I really love doing weekend trips and theres only so much you can do and so far you can go for a weekend
I would love to be in Switzerland and explore the region and the neighboring countries
Hungarians (and czechs, slovakians and croats, tough not slovenians) are our national bros
At least from what I expirienced, you just go over the border, adapt to the language or switch to english and youre right at home
Now kiss
Bei uns dadat ma eh nix lernan miassn
Nua wia ma kunstvui a 'Oida' anwendt
Ok wow I took a long time to understand that
I'm ashamed of myself
If a little reality-altering makes you happy I say go for it
I guess it comes from history or then it is a typical love hate relationship some countries share, especially when one country is considered like a sibling but gets more attention for being "fancier, more famous" or whatsoever
I found Finns share the same sentiment towards Sweden, for example (but correct me if I am wrong)
It could very well similar to the feeling certain regions share with the capital (Wien vs
Tirol for example)
Anyway, I wouldn't say Austrians have a stereotypical dislike for Germany as a whole
Austrians will often stress that Bavaria is different to the rest of Germany, maybe because it is culturally same same but different
And then I wouldn't call it hate or dislike either
For most people it is more like teasing your sibling
Btw
I also heard Germans making fun of Austrians for our dialects
Even though I know that it doesn't occur to the same extend I feel like this stereotypical jokes are somewhat mutual
Lakes are just as lovely
I mean, Graz is kind of awesome
I went there three times with friends and we always met a lot of people and had amazing experiences
Also in Vienna there is a fuckload to events
May I ask what did you do when you were here and also where you are from
Slovenia is indeed lovely
Although I‘m not kidding unlike those [Brexiteers]
Ive actually been in Slovenia just yesterday and had a great time :) apart from the unfortunately not that good prekmurska gibanica
Well I mean, sLOVEnia has love in it

You are definitely right
Finding interesting events or happenings is quite difficult when you are traveling and craving for something not that touristy
It often takes knowledge of a city or the right pages (facebook, instagram) where to look
It probably really depends what you compare it to and what you expect
I am originally from a village with 700 people so going to Vienna or Graz was always an adventure for me
> I love Budapest
\- Brits, probably
The word you are looking for is „oligarchy“.

Not very common
There's a plan to move more institutions away from Vienna, but currently only 5 (National Environmental Office in Klosterneuburg, National Office for Water Management in Scharfling, the Austrian National Forestry in Purkersdorf, the National Office for Viniculture in Eisenstadt and the National Center for Language Competence) of 68 National Institutions are not in the capital, and 2 of those are in suburbs
Relocating the Environmental Office to Klosterneuburg was one of the most obvious "lets do some stupid shit that makes our promise technically true" that I have ever seen
Yes, you moved it out of Vienna - but only by one mile
Yes it’s true

There is a kind of "hipster" trend to reuse german words where in recent decade an anglicism has been used more commonly: "Kapelle" for popmusic "bands", not just traditional music
There are lot's of more examles on the tip of my tongue, but at the moment I can't quite think of them
Maybe somebody else can help out
Good point
Every second hipster shop that's remotely connected to producing something is calling itself a M A N U F A K T U R nowadays
Other good examples for hipster lingo come to mind, mostly in English and especially in connection to the whole "art of manliness" movement: bespoke; artisan; anything else
fun fact: the chinese wanted to bring comrade (Tóngzhì) back into the political sphere, but stopped once they realised gay chinese men already used the term as slang for themselves
You don't. There's no other word, but to talk about honor *at all* sounds dangerously right-wing reactionary to German ears
It was replaced by Anstand (decency), Würde (dignity) and some other words
There isn't and there's nothing old fashioned about the word
Don't know where he got that from
Had kind of a renaissance due to the influence of Turkish notions of honour though
At least that's where I feel the whole Ehrenmann thing is coming from, together with "Küss dein Auge" etc
More proper would be "Es ist mir eine Ehre ..." and then the other person can reply "Die Ehre ist ganz meinerseits
In any case, such phrases are so old-fashioned (like powdered wig old-fashioned) that anybody who uses them does so ironically

Who hasn’t?!

What is the point is that guns aren't "personal freedom" for everyone, but kind of a sport to which you have to be trained
and  are very good reports of the daily show
I'm Austrian and it's not easy to buy guns here, but in my community many people own guns which they got from their grandfather
But when I see somebody holding a gun, I'm totally chilled, because a) almost all (male) Austrians are trained on guns due to milliary service, b) they're not holding guns to "defend" themselves, but to go hunting
But if I go to any other country without a shooting tradition and/or universal millitary service, I'm actually scared of people wearing guns, even when it's the police
I'm not saying, that America should make an universal millitary service or that they should steal the chilled culture, but they maybe should reevaluate what can they actually do better without saying "in Switzerland it works too so we can have our guns wherever and whenever you want". Even in Switzerland, nobody is wearing guns
Lot of people has them at home and they use it in competitions or in the woods, but often they don't even have munition at home
>The problem is American culture
I wouldn't exactly say culture
Most of it are social and socioeconomic problems that have to be dealt with
Also the lack of (mental) health care makes it even worse
Banning the guns won't stop the massacres
You gotta tackle the problem at its root
Its actualy very easy to get a gun here
Category C, D are unregulated, you just need to be over 18 and without a criminal record
For category B, the test is easier than getting a driving license
Oh like "a well regulated militia"
Damn, it seems like developers aren't even building small apartments 'cause if you can afford to buy one, you can also afford to buy an expensive one
Yes all the time

"and it has these four, down there, you know
and the teeth, they are like

Icelandic is super cool IMO
Icelandic
It's in my personal opinion and I mean this without any offense, the most elegant and melodic of the languages I've crossed paths with
Danish & Swedish both sound too much like a very weird twisted version of German with some uncommon sounds, while Finnish is just a bit too far from my Indo-European expectations
Norwegian is quite nice actually but has imo the same problem as many sequels in movies
The cypriots over at r/AskEurope always tell us that you guys basically feel at home in Greece anyways :P
I'll be here for Liechtenstein
Do you feel at home in Germany
Liechtenstein can into mircostate that is part of GB
Austrian here: The *new" ss-ß rule
And by new I mean from around 1996
Until then you basically had to know which word you write with a double "ss" and which one with a sharp "s". Then they made it simpler: If "ss", the vocal before is spoken short; if "ß", the vocal beforebis long
Only that people got completely confused and write how they want
Especially in the last years you keep seeing the word "Strasse" more and more, even by big companies, although it is just wrong
C'mon people, it looks horrible and it is not that hard
We're sharing borders with 8 countries, which is the closest
Ok, let's get started
Germany: instant war about who is better
Czech Republic: remove your fucking atmonic litter from our border
Slovakia: (I know too less about Slovakia)
Hungary: welcome back :)
Slovenia: (I know too less about Slovenia)
Italy: give us Südtirol back, then we are cool
Switzerland: oh that would be great for us but bad for Swiss people :0
Liechtenstein: Well
still protected by Switzerland but a small cutie :3

As a kid I was 100% sure that Sweden is where Switzerland is and Switzerland is where Sweden is
I thought, that there is no good beer in southern countries
Than there is mythos (I think it's called) a very good greek beer
As a gullible kid I used to think they spoke Latin in Latvia
I thought most of these too :‘D
And I still sometimes think Belarus is in France
Idky, it just sounds french
I thought (until now) that only in Germany they limitless
It's simple : there are no kangaroos in Austria ;)
Well, in a way they do, it's just called Swiss german
I can hardly understand it so I think it can count as it's own language
[German] Schweiz & Schweden - They also sounded very similar to me, especially with my dialect: Schwaiz & Schwäidn :‘D
Rename to Nebelux to get neighbours right
Yeah, they should have tried to unify them back when it was starting to gain traction
Yes
With ketchup, please
Depends on the number of people
If there are enough kids to justify an extra table, it's common
If there's not enough space around the main table, yes
At my grandma's it was always in the next room, though only five meters from the main table, really
That way the kids can be louder and talk to their cousins rather than get bored/annoy the adults
Around 13/14 or so each of us decided we were grown and wanted to sit at the adults' table, only to quickly regret as we grew bored
So now, when all of us are grown, we still insist on sitting at the kids' table, though usually Grandma joins us now
She's a kid at heart

Austria: No, it's not an issue, as long as it's not smelly food and not eaten too close to other people (on public transport or the like)
Answering for some other countries I know: It seems to be an issue in France, Spain, Indonesia, Japan
Mostly not for the food itself, but for lack of grace or seemingly "not having your life together" – after all, who in their right mind would want to eat while walking even though it's a) unhealthy b) hard to enjoy your food that way c) kinda sad and lonely and lastly d) dirty and kinda disorderly
Interestingly, some of these countries (Indonesia, Japan) on the other hand have not problem with wolfing your food down like you haven't seen any food in a month (seriously, in Japan the parents are scolding their skids to eat *faster* because they're eating too slow)
This shows that in the end what's acceptable is very arbitrary and culturally defined, and that "upsetting your stomach by eating too fast" is probably a made-up "issue" just like that as well
Note that also in these countries, a continuum exists from accepting to condescending from city to countryside and from younger to older people
So, among your teenage friends in the city it might be ok (althoug I'm kinda sceptical for Japan on this one; they *really* don't eat on the go), for your grandma in some rural part of the country it might me highly disturbing
Leberkäsesemmerl sales would hit rock bottom
It would kill the Leberkäse industry
Idk sitting on a bench and eating a Leberkassemmel is totally fine, but walking and eating would be considered inappropriate
At least by the old people in my village
The horror
But they have the Leberkas recipe
"The major problem—*one* of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them
To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must *want* to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job
" - Douglas Adams
I thought it was quite befitting for our relationship with leadership
"Austria is the only country that gets dumber from experience".
-Attributed to Karl Kraus
Odd choice
who said that and how does it fit your country
In Austria there are three Supreme courts
The „Supreme Court“ - OGH, Oberster Gerichtshof
The „Constitution Court“ VfGH, Verfassungsgerichtshof
The „Administration Court“ VWGH, Verwaltungsgerichtshof
The first is responsible for civil and criminal cases, the second one decides wether a law, act or sentence is in accordance with the constitution and human rights and the last of them is responsible for all trials regarding the city, county, state or federal administration, this also includes traffic fines or construction projects
Most of the time you can not call one of them directly but have to have a trial at one of the “lower” courts first
Only the constitution court could be called nearly anytime you think a law is not in accordance with the constitution
Court decisions in Austria can not develop the law which means all of those courts could literally decide differently any other time and they can and do disagree on each other’s decision
Austrian dialekt numbers are of course build like the german ones but we have other bullshit when it comes to numbers
Counting from one to twelve (in dialekt):
Oans, zwoa, drä, fia, fümf, segs, siem, ocht, nä, zehn, ööf, zwöf
The name of the digits
Add mostly an a to the end except for fia and nä who change to fiara and näna since else it sounds stupid
If you know the exact count of something you use one of two versions
If you add what you are refering to after the number you use, like the germans, the counting ones (one is the exception, both high german and dialekt specify if the thing you are refering to is male, female or nether by using one of three versions of one)
If you don't add what you are refering to to the end but it has to be figured out from the context you use a new number system that standard german doesn't have (technicly it was once part of the standard but noone used it in standard german so they removed it)
You add an e sound to the end for a count of 1 or between 5 and 19 (except for 7) and a ge for 20-99 (from where it skips 100 and restarts at 101 from the beginning), seven changes from siem to siewane for some reason, 4 changes from fia to fiare,  two and three don't have such a form (and therefor also 102, 103, 202, 203
), 100, 1000, 1000,... also don't have such a form
And now comes the biggest bullshit, there are special words in standard german for 100, 1000, 10000,... that also are just 100, 1000, 10000,... with an e at the end of the word, these words have the meaning, significantly more then 100, 1000, 10000,... , and the dialekt versions also have this meaning, therefor you have numbers that are build like the words that reference an exact number of things but don't reference an exact number
And thats bullshit as fuck and i had to explain that hole number mess to a german student who was fucking confused about the numbers the professor in front of him was using and why he was using "multiple versions so inconsistently".
Thank you for coming to my rant about numbers
In Romania all military establishments belong to the Ministry of Defence
Old bases either are continued to be used, or are left abandoned
However even for the latter the ministry almost never ceases the right of property to local municipalities for further development
There's the Arsenal Vienna which was built as a military base in the 19th century after the 1848 revoultion, in order to control future uprisings and revolts
Basically, the 19-year-old monarch Franz Joseph had it personally commissioned, so he could bombard his own people in case they became "unruly" again
[It's built like a fortress] and stands on a hill, [commanding the entire inner city] You could literally shoot 19th century artillery directly into the city from there
Nowadays the main building the museum for military history and houses decommisioned old artillery, tanks and airplanes
The surrounding buidlings (orignally barracks) are partly used by the Austrian military, partly as civilian residential houses
The flats are quite nice there, and it has a lot of open green space around and between and it's right next to a big park (Schweizergarten)
There's also a huge workshop of the federal theaters there, where they produce big stage set pieces, and they have rehearsal stages there
The building complex is quite nice actually, has an Arab/Spanish touch, with lots of Arabesques
[This is the gatehouse of the front building] the [Arsenal church in the back of the complex] the [frontside] and the [backside of the museum] one of the [residential buildings] that's the [tennis center] and here's a [historic illustration] (I think a number of objects were bombed away in WWII)
Since I live nearby, I like going on walks there
I’m most surprised with the small percentage of conservatives
Opus (even from my home town) and Falco
Darius and Finlay, Falco
Let's not forget the magic that is Lordi
Aren't they Moldavian
I haven't heard about any of those tbh
Well then they aren't from your country as of 2019 nevertheless
>Haven't you heard this
Nope
I'm neither into Metal, nor into (modern) Pop, so that might explain my ignorance :)
I didn't know that most of them have Romanian citizenship to be honest
I guess it's also a different way of thinking
For instance I'd never consider a German-speaking South Tyrolean an Austrian, even though they are basically indistinguishable from "our" Tyroleans
I actually knew at least one of the artists mentioned in all the other replies, yes
Depends if your in the city or in a rural village
I grew up in a rural area and you’d just greet anyone everywhere
It’s considered impolite if you do not
Now I live in the next city for University purposes and it’s kind of the other way round
If you greet someone you don’t know you get a weird look

Theres also "laufen" which means "running" in Austria and "walking" in Germany
Its so confusing
"Ich laufe zur Bibliothek" --> my first reaction is to think of a burning library or something
Also "anfahren" which in Germany means starting to drive and here driving into something
I scheiß mi au
I had no idea that this isn't said in Germany
I would say my favourite false friend is "laufen", which exclusively means "running" in Austria, but is walking in Germany and "rennen" is running
In Austria, "rennen" is also running and my brother was once instructed by a German acquaintance to walk "laufen" somewhere and when he literally started running the dude shouted "ich hab gesagt laufen, nicht rennen
" (I told you to run (ie walk), not run
Which was hilarious
TIL and TIL for both of these
One more thing I want to add is "sich ausgehen", which is a super practical expression with the meaning of "to suffice". It's not used (sometimes not even understood) in Germany, and while it wouldn't get me in a tight situation, I often struggle trying to replace it with other words because it's so common here, for anything from resources ("der Einkauf geht sich mit einem Zehner aus" - our shopping will be below 10 euros), to space ("geht sich das im Kofferraum aus" - will that fit in the trunk), to time ("der frührere Zug geht sich aus" - we'll make the earlier train)
Isnt laufen running and rennen running fast
I dialect or imprecise speech it is commonly used though: "Was hat dir der Lehrer heute gelernt
" sounds much more natural to me than "Was hat er dich gelehrt", that would sound quite formal, maybe even a bit archaic
It's because Austrian German is more conservative than German-German
So apparently it shares a bunch of older vocabulary and other traits with Dutch
Many Germans have told me that a lot of Austrian vocabulary is understandable, but sounds really old-fashioned, like middle-ages old-fashioned
Like the word for *clothes*: *Gewand/Gwandl (*A-G) vs
*Kleidung/Kleider* (G-G)
I thought that "geil" for a food was about being overly fat, not overly sweet
Pretty popular
It's a very common sight if you walk on the streets
Quite popular with males from ~20 to ~40
I feel like 40 is the age, where the popularity drops slightly, but in my age group it's very popular
I think only 1 friend of mine is really "clean shaven", everyday
It ranges from a few days stubble to quite a full beard
Nothing crazy in my circle of friends though
I'd guess most are just to lazy to shave every day, since it's such a nuisance
In Greece, where I grew up, it's pretty common
In Austria, where I live now, it's not THAT popular and I might get some comments like "Taliban" which I reply that most philosophers and scientists of the ancient world had beards
But it is mostly acceptable and women like it
A bit of „salt“ looks really good though
I'm optimistic only to be disappointed later
As always
I don't think we'll make it into the knock-out stage
What Sport are we talking
Or is this just a joke where everyone just pretends to know
(apparently I don't get it
Our squad is pretty strong, but Foda is just an idiot
We should still be able to get out of our group, but everything more would be a huge surprise to me tbh
Everything other than a complete humiliation is a win in my book
We have a chance this time around
Ukraine is doable on a good day and well beating Makedonia is a necessity to advance
Not seeing any points against the Netherlands
Honestly I think 3 points may be enough to advance and 4 is almost a safe-call for knock-out stage
With our performance lately you may really have a chance
Scotland definitly has seen better times but the Austrian team has had them too
I'd say they are roughly equal as has the draw in the first game shown
Probably will be a fight between Denmark, Austria and Scotland
Denmark might be a tid bit stronger than the other two but all three are roughly in the same category of B-List countries
Our coach is a fucking idiot, so there's definitely a chance you'll finish above us (although drawing against Israel doesn't really help Scotland's case either)
Honestly I think in your group only two will advance, I have a feeling someone will lose against the other two world class countries and will end up with to few points to advance as third
American-football, Fistball, indoor athletics, volleyball, baseball, triathlon, enduro, gymnastics, rallye, Kanu, basketball, ...
On paper not, but considering the performance of Austrian teams in Euro and World Cup, you cant't be certain ;)
Last time around we went into the Euro with overconfidence and were shot down by Iceland and Hungary
Well Portugal got its feathers ruffled too and only qualified as 3rd for the Knock Out Round but they went on to win the Title
On the club level there were a few hickups in the past years but I would be a real surprise if Austria would be able to pull it off
The Oranjes always were a good competition team, Austria had its last good showing in 1954 and its last semi decent one in 1978
Yeah that was a national embarrasment
Especially afteg we kicked out the Germans 4 years earlier
The team was booed out of the airport when they returned in 82, in 78 they got a heroes welcome
French
Also French people speaking German
Hungarian
I think it's a beautiful-sounding, fascinating language which I have a personal emotional attachment to, as my grandfather is from Hungary and I'm kind of a Austria-Hungary fanboy
Spanish, but the one spoken in Latin Amerika and Central America
It's just a really beautiful language and I also enjoy visiting the different countrie there
I also like English, because it helps me talk with so many people around the world
I love it so much when I hear someone speak with a real scottish accent
Also Finnish
I Like English a lot
It has a great flow to it and it's very effective
Italian, Spanish and Japanese sound the best to me
Greek and Russian
They are a mix of beautiful and harsh
Spanish, especially if it's with a southern/Andalusian accent
The way they lisp the s's, swallow the d's and labialize the v's... so fast and rolling and fluid, yet soft
Always makes me excited to hear it, but I got a huge boner for Spanish culture in general
I love hearing people speak in korean, it just has this melody to it that i like
This
Hungarian almost sounds like a waltz to me and it’s quite deep and sensual
Feels quite comfy too (if you're from eastern Austria)
The way they darken their vowels in general, and pronounce a and á... feels right at home
Metternich was a dick to the Hungarians and Italians
John Rabe, a Nazi businessman, is celebrated as a hero in China, and had his former home repurposed as a memorial hall
He lived in Nanjing (formerly written as Nanking) during the Invasion of the Japanese army, which would be later known as "Rape of Nanjing". Before the massacres started, he, along with 14 foreign nationals (americans and europeans), formed the "International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone" and created the Nanking Safety Zone to provide Chinese refugees with food and shelter from the impending Japanese slaughter
John Rabe was elected leader and tried to stop the atrocities of the Japanese by using his rank in the NSDAP, but could only delay them
It is estimated that he saved around 200
000 - 250
000 Chinese people from certain death
He documented everything in his diaries, took films and photographs, and showed them in public lectures, but the Gestapo quickly shut this down
After the war he lost his work permit and lived in poverty with his family
Even after he passed the denazification the family lived of wild roots his children found
When the Chinese People heard about this they sent them a large sum of money and monthly food packages, to which he replied with a personal letter every time
After his death his grave was relocated to Nanjing
The public stance on all that in austria is rather .... subdued
He clearly did good with his deeds, but also was an active member of the Naziparty
As many things concerning fascism and nazism in austria, we acknowledge it, politely smile and change the subject
I was actually quit astonished when I learned that Emperor Franz Joseph is negativly viewed in Hungary, but I would guess that's  also the case in other former parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
i don't think that he is seen as anything remotly positive in austria as well
Who considers Metternich as a national hero in Austria (other than Kickl maybe)
I mean, Radetzky, yes
But Metternich
He was ousted by the German Austrians themselves in 1848 because he was so hated
But I wouldn't say he is seen positivly in Austria
For everyone with common sense he is a disgrace
I wouldn't say he's a villain here, most people probably don't know him
And although he was a member of the Nazi Party, it's safe to say he did far more good than bad stuff
After all, he saved hundreds of thousands from death and rape
He's often called "second Schindler", rightfully in my opinion
> Is he viewed positively in austria
not at all
Well he did do the austro-hungarian ausgleich, transforming the austrian empire into the austro-hungarian empire, and atleast at the end of his reign, he was generally beloved by his people
Also noting that the great cities in his empire prosperd harboring great artists and thinkers
Maybe from a modern point of view but during and after the occupation he was surely not seen in a positive light
I mean, there are memorials built for those who fought against the french occupation
No, I don't think this will ever happen with any of the official languages of the European countries
English will always be a second language
While there is more media available in English these days, people's everyday conversations are still in the countries' languages, as is TV, school, all the laws, etc
Plus, if there was a danger of English taking over I think many countries would take measures against it in order to preserve their local language and culture
That is the most Romanian way I can imagine to answer this question
If it's any consolation plattdeutsch lives on in Canada
" In den 1870er Jahren siedelten viele Mennoniten von Russland nach Kanada und in den 1920er Jahren von Kanada nach Paraguay und Mexico
Unter diesen Mennoniten wird Plattdeutsch noch als allgemeine Umgangssprache benutzt
In Kanada steigt das Interresse an Mennoniten Plattdeutsch besonders unter den Nachkommen der 1870er Russland - Kanada Ansiedler mittlerweile wieder an

I never heard about this
Given that I understand Vorarlbergerisch better than Spanish, can I now claim two additional languages
Like those people saying "I speak Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian,..."?
It was a joke but doesn't surprise me that you thought I'm serious
Good old you afterall lol
I know but no one in Austria (and to a lesser extent Germany) calls these languages by their official name
If you tell people from my area they are speaking Bavarian they'll be laughing their ass off
We refer to the area the dialect is spoken in like I did with Vorarlberg
Same with "Wienerisch", "Steyrisch", "Kärntnerisch" or in Germany "Fränkisch", "Sächsisch",..
Senner
Mountain man or woman (strangly it's regionally different If it's a men or women Jobs) who lives during Summer with the cattle of a Village on the alpine meadows and cares for them and makes cheese from their milk
Victual Brothers and Likedeelers, Pirates and privateers of the north and baltic sea
Rightfully so
In some parts of Austria Senner were mostly women
They became a symbol of freedom and free love, because the church had no rule over them when they were in they mountains
My grandfather originally learned to be a Handzuginstrumentenmacher, which was/is the profession of people who build accordions, bandoneons, harmonica and melodicas
Also a job that's very much tied to folk culture
Auf der Alm gibts keine Sünd
Apples and oranges
No, actually it's not even even that
Apples and ... battleships
Funnily as little child I always thought that means the Alm is a serene and untainted place
I don't even wanna know how many 1970s German Porno movies have exactly that title
The present's still pretty great, all things considering
Nice self-own
I have family there who I visit a lot and so many people are "apolitical". younger generations especially are sort of detached from politics
its depressing, especially in a country that had to endure so much to even have a vote
I mean its not like people talk politics and enjoy it all the time in other places, but in Poland "all politics suck and they will suck forever thats why I don't vote" seems like such a common stance to have
my honest opinion is that Poland, and this might be true in some variation for most of former "Eastern Europe", expected so much more from the EU
things improved (honestly Warsaw in the mid 90s compared to today is like night and day) but from what I remember the promises and expectations were so much bigger - wealth, freedom, equality
all of that and more
there was excitement in the air, fundamental changes for the better coming
people had this anticipation and then they got a couple new banks and supermarket chains plus some shiny office buildings and thats about it - or at least thats how its perceived
so the EU never won the hearts of people
not that other countries love the union all that much, but Poland feels like the guy who finally gets into that cool new club in town only to find out that its expensive and the music kind of sucks
people in the "West" always get mad and point to the money chart when this comes up, which to me kind of shows that there is at least some truth behind the sentiment
Hopefully no more fascist asses, that's my thought
One of my best friends is lesbian and autistic while in Poland
From what shes telling me atm I hope that it doesnt get any worse for her
Its really bad as it is
PISS, amazing name for a nazi team
that's what she said
I personally don't really see ideas of the authoritarian left (ie the marxist leninists) in the lefty parties of Europe though
Could you elaborate on what you mean by that
Thanks :)
But that's not them turning to authoritarian policies
Far from it
I do see the SocDem parties not turning a blind eye to intersectional problems really positively
But the main problem of todays social democratic parties is them buying into the neoliberal turn of the 1980s and them stopping to address concerns like housing, equal wages, etc
seriously
The SocDem parties that did fared rather well like in Portugal and Labour in GB before the whole Brexit debacle
In Malcolm in the Middle, Grete and Otto are both Scandinavian, with their accent changed accordingly (and quite hilariously: "Sieh mir in den Augeenn")
I feel they did a good job there; apart from that there's a few dubs that actually improve on the original, Kungfu Hustle comes to mind ("Ich will n Stracciatella"), as well as Leslie Nielsen and Bud Spencer/Terence Hill movies, where they add a few jokes that were obviously the result of ad-libbing, and even if it doesn't give you 100% of the original movie experience, those types of movies often fit the additional silliness
Then there's other examples where jokes are just not translated because it's either hard, or the translators are incompetent and don't fully understand the original, for example with the Simpsons ("bürgersteigsurfende Kubikstrahler", ugh)
In german it's  "mit Wasser
No idea what you watched, but it’s Schweinebacke in German
I remember one other really wierd scene from the episode "Eight Misbehavin'" (just googled it)
In the English version, Homer said "Don't worry, I've brought chloroform", and Apu says "You idiot, those are colored forms
And in German, they literally translated "colored forms" it to "kolorierte Förmchen".
Üter
The Umlauts are not optional
It's still not a real name though
Sounds very North German to me, like Lars or Ingo or Hugo
haven't heard it used in real life, though
I'll try as an outsider:

Austria as a whole has 8 IKEAs, which is more than I thought tbh
No Markus
I saw a black guy back in the early 2000s and someone screamed banana eater at him
Still makes my blood boil when I think of it, it was horrible
I also watched a few black YouTubers who shared their opinions on racism in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and it didn't sound very optimistic
One of them was even spat on
> because it can be confused with Romania or Rome
Not really a problem in German: Rumänien, Rom vs Roma & Sinti
Name me a country that is more Central European than the Czech and us
It is not always clear cut since there is always a gradient, but i think we are very clearly in central europe, geographicly and culturally
People here are getting heated over pointless arguments imo, since there is never a clear border but a gradient from one country to another
It also depends on your relative Position
Calling Trentino or Alto adige southern europe sounds silly to me
I would also never think of Slovenia or Czechia when people say Eastern Europe, but a Spaniard or Portugiese would maybe think otherwise
I would say that we're part of the DACH region
D Germany
A Austria
Ch Switzerland
I would consider Switzerland a Western European country
Or you know, being a part of the Austrohungarian Empire for about 400 years
lol
And one of our favorite past times is sit down with friends and have a mug of beer
Best trips around the time when I finished school were to the czech republic
The beer was great, the guys were funs after a few of them and the girls ... well thats another story
The girls were hot, they know
If you have weed on you in munich and the police sees you, you get a cavity search
If you have weed on you in prague and the police sees you, they wish you a nice day
Yeah back in the late 90ties going to Moravia, a mug of beer cost about an eighth of what it cost in Austria
Prague was a bit more expensive but still very affordable, and a great city to visit
Nowadays it has become very touristy and priced while still a tad bit cheaper have almost caught up
Well all prices except beer which is about half what it costs here
Yes, of course
And I do expect guests to take off their shoes too
Yes of course
I know in the Basque Country it's more common, but far from being the norm
I don't care if it's rude
My hardwood floor was expensive, you better not make scratches in it
Over here everybody is prepared to take their shoes off, it's seen as quite impolite to leave them on, so most people dress accordingly
And of course I offer guest slippers to everyone
And it always makes me feel icky, like I want to clean the floor after they've left
>What if their feet smell
I don't understand that argument at all - feet start smelling if they spend too much time in non-"breating" shoes, so you make your feet just smell more if you keep your shoes on
Especially when the feet heat up indoors
Rocks, pebbles, stiletto heels
Most of the classics that don’t use fancy meat cuts are basically „poor people food“.
So for Austria that would probably everything with Dumplings, Gröstel, some types of fish dishes, things with offal and so on
If I offer those dishes to my friends from the US or Asia they mostly are a bit skeptical but like it after a few bites
we call them "poor knights" here
You mean [Pofesen]
Arme Ritter are the half of Bovesen
The [mcdonald's on Schwarzenbergplatz in Vienna] is in a pretty fancy building
It used to be [way uglier] with big red signs and whatnot
I have one example that beats that
Although it's not fast food, but fast fashion, so *almost* the same
[The H&M on Graben is the fanciest H&M you'll ever see
] It's all marble and hardwood and Art Noveau
[However, the smaller one on Mariahilferstraße has a really fancy interior]
This is my favourite building in all of Austria and I live like 4 mins away
I doubt you can paint our buildings
At least I‘ve never seen/heard of anybody painting our building without just full on renovating them
And idk if you can legally paint them (idk the rules)
We usually just powerwash them
Maybe I missed it, but I found the first questions a little bit difficult to answer (was that the anxiety inventory
) because I wasn't exactly sure if it meant in general or at the moment
At the moment I am actually rather anxious, but about an upcoming exam, not COVID-19
I guess I answered the questions as intended though (little anxiety regarding COVID-19)
So maybe a control question about other life events would make sense there
I think trust in the government might also be a factor here, whether people believe the government is in control of the situation, so there is less need for personal control
Countries are handling this quite differently and I am sure this (and the extent to which each country is affected which can change in just a few days) makes a difference in the perceived anxiety
I am sure I would have answered this differently 3 days ago and I probably would answer differently 3 days from now, because the situation is changing so rapidly
Just be careful if you try to compare answers from different points in time
Good luck
There is not supposed to be a big difference
The questions are repetitive to make sure it does not depend too much on the phrasing and also to see if you are consistent with you answers (some don't actually answer the questionnaire they just pick the same answer over and over again)
Of course [I Am From Austria]
And I don't know if these count, because there's no text, but also [The Blue Danube] and [Radetzky March] for some reason
Hulabalu by Andreas Gablier ️
Nein
It was common in the past nowadays not so much
Wouldn't say very common, but not unheard of
Sadly, rabbit has gone out of fashion somewhat
Its something special, to be sure, but not unusual
Unsurprisingly our cuisine isn't very different in that regard
But i think with the spread of Asian cuisines throughout Europe eating ducks was normal everywhere
I have to say, they also make for a good Schnitzel
adding this for others: both types get eaten; bunnies raised by humans for their meat as well as hares as a type of game meat, the latter mostly as a festive dish in autumn
Do you have horse as a regular dish as well
We do eat it here but mostly in form of Leberkas
I was about to write Austria and Germany, but its really just Austria and Bavaria
I was shocked how much Carinthia reminded me of Austria
It's called Liechtenstein btw ;-)
It helps that a lot of Turkish people descend from assimilated Greeks of the region
Yes do this but please give back south tyrol first
Austria are slavic people with german language and germanic culture
Slovenia are slavic people with slavic language and germanic culture
Nah, they only hate it when you say they are similar to those damn Prussians
Yeah me too
I would argue that Vorarlberg ist closer to Switzerland and Baden-Württemberg, and the rest of Austria is closer to Bavaria, since Bavarians after all are only lowland Austrians
Northern Germany might just be more like the Netherlands
What the hell was the "und" supposed to be
If that was a "stand", how in the world did your autocorrect get to that
I'm baffled
The funny thing is that most prussians did never see much of austria except maybe vienna and so claim that we are almost the same
That many million people cities have a lot in common is completly ignored
Yes vienna is similar to some cities of germany but vienna isn't similar to the rest of austria
Its always the damn nationalists ruining the day for everyone
Yeah I think there we have the problem of definition
Greekness wasnt tied to genetics and one genetic group until very late
I was basing my comment on the more byzantine definition of greekness which also included the Anatolians and (oftentimes) the Armenians in the greater cultural sphere
They all were for all intents and purposes "greek" as that definition was mostly related to religion, language and looking to Constantinople culturally
Through this we also have many Turks being described as Greeks when they were in the service of the empire and spoke the language (the emperors "greek" general who accompanied the crusading forces during the First crusade for example is suspected to be of Turkish origins, which may explain why Tancred and the other crusaders hated him so much)
Modern day Greece on the other hand and the modern definition of greekness is mostly a result of the making of modern Greece after the revolution and the age of nationalism
It also didnt help that the unifying institutions of a "greek" empire had been increasingly shattered
So less of a genetic link to modern day greeks but more of the modern day Turks being descendentd of a population in a largely culturally "greek" (read culturally, religiously and also linguistically influenced) multiethnic empire
I dont know - I am from Southern Styria and feel no connection whatsoever to Bavaria
I can hardly understand them and the food seems weird to me
I think only the Bundesländer at the border can identify that much with Bavaria
Lets say it like this: if you look at culture a nation made out of austria, bavaria, czechia and maybe even slovenia would make more sense then germany
Germany is basicly made out of some states that all don't have much in comon
Areas like schleswig-holstein and thüringen have less in common then austria and switzerland
It depends from which part of Austria you are from
No but the culture of slovenia is way closer to austria and bavaria then to the other ex yugoslavic countries
Czechia is also cultural closer to austria then to most slavic nations,
Since czechia and slovenia were part of austria and even before that part of the hre and controlled by mostly german nobels for most of history they picked up a lot of germanic culture
Yeah you are right
I would also say that Tyrol (where I am from) is closer to Bavaria than Burgenland or Wien for example
Descendent from germanic tribes are people from north germany, the nederlands, north belgium, england, norway, sweden and denmark
South germany, austria and switzerland are mostly not descendents from germanic tribes but by slavic ones
Over time these areas just came into the hands of nations like east frankia which were majority germanic so the culture and language spread south
It basicly doesn't matter anymore since it is itrelevant after so many generation which tribes someone descent from but since austria loves to show how different they are from north germany we know little things like this
But we have way "better" differences we can show north germany to annoy them
No and no
Not really, from reading the title alone I could be super hyped
I definitely ain't though
Jo, wos zum teifl sogts eis iwa se
Also, it's not even true
In "other demographics" you can [see] that the number of more men to women is insignificant
A simple google search yields the total amount of men in millions to be 2
67 to 2
63 for women
It seems to me like OP has spent a bit too much time in the incel subs, especially as there doesn't need to be a woman for every man
There are also gay people, lesbians, people with no interest in romantic partners and, well, straight women that are *not* competing to get a girlfriend as soon as they enter Norway
If you speak both english and german I think all of the except Gold (Au), Quecksilber/Quicksilver (Hg), Blei/Lead (Pb), Zinn/Tin (Sn), Silber/Silver (Ag), Kupfer/Copper (Cu), Eisen/Iron (Fe) make complete sense
If you speak only German there are a few more like Wasserstoff/Hydrogen (H), Kohlenstoff/Carbon (C), Stickstoff/Nitrogen (N) and Sauerstoff/Oxygen (O) for example
I Always wonder which of the Sn and Zn is Zink and Zinn (tin)
It makes more sense in German than English
Sodium (Na) is "Natrium". Potassium (K) is "Kalium".
Then again, Nitrogen (N) is "Stickstoff" and Oxygen (O) is "Sauerstoff"...
I guess it evens out in the end
We got the rare earths down, but you got better gasses
Another thing that matches up: (K) *Potassium*, which is *Kalium* in German
(Hg) Mercury is *Quecksilber*, which is a cognate to mercury's older English name *quicksilver*.
Stoff isnt stuff
It can mean fabric, or material or even a substance
The best one is Nitrogen - Stickstoff -  suffocate substance
come to think about it, we do that for C (Kohle) if talking in an abbreviated manner about the components of chemical bonds and molecules sometimes
never for other elements though, for some like H it would get confusing (Wasser), for others like O (Sauer-) it's just not customary
and the official names always contain -stoff
yeah but we don't go around calling O2 Sauerzeug
see what they mean
extremely based germans, as usual
and in that case, that includes us
I don't know anyone who doesn't speak in dialect, people who speak standard german here get joked about
Arguably, for Austria the difference between language and dialect is very important
Dialects
Very
Very
Common, even though a lot of it is slowly being eroded by standard German words
Distinct languages we don't have any, but we have minority languages from the neighboring countries in border regions which we collectively tend to forget about very often
Sometimes those were even politicized as "foreign" (Slovenian in Carinthia - "Ortstafelstreit"), even though those ethnicities/language groups lived there since hundreds of years and even have a constitutional right to be treated just like German
Yeah just saying moin probably does it ;)
I have to give the croatian speaking minority in Burgenland a honourable mention since croatia is not a neighbouring country
As far as I know there is less of a political exploitation and Radio Burgenland even broadcasts partly in Croatian
Hey, already the second American in Austria here on askeurope, welcome :)
The thing is, Austrian dialect is not "official", so whenever you want to write something, you need to use Hochdeutsch
Dialects differ from Bundesland to Bundesland, and from village to village
So it's something you have to just try and pick up from talking to friends, unfortunately
If you do learn from an Austrian teacher, and your pronunciation becomes very good, chances are still that Germans will recognize that you learned it in Austria
The distinction is mainly political
There are different languages which are 99% intellegible and dialects of a language where you only understand 30-50%.
Even linguists dont agree, imo its up to you to decide :)
Another extremely interesting historical figure from Poland was witold pilecki
After the invasion in 1939, he went into auschwitz concentration camp voluntarily and organised uprising and resistance against the german occupation
He is the only recorded person to go into a concentration camp voluntarily and make it out alive
In 1946 he was hung by the Soviets for anti-soviet behaviour because he joined the polished partisans and fought against the soviet Union
Döner Kebab
Italien and Chinese Restaurants are common, even in pretty rural areas
Greek comes imho afterwards
Indian/Pakistani food is not that uncommon
American restaurants with steaks and hamburger can be found too
I mean, it makes sense that the German food is the most spread of all
The last sentence, no, a real Döner is with lamb/mutton and cabbage
Spitzen Liste
For all those without any clue (like me) here's the groups:
* Group A: Turkey, Italy, Wales, Switzerland
* Group B: Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Russia
* Group C: Netherlands, Ukraine, Austria, Play-off winner D (A)*
* Group D: England, Croatia, Play-off winner C, Czech Republic
* Group E: Spain, Sweden, Poland, Play-off winner B
* Group F: Play-off winner A (D)*, Portugal, France, Germany
I'd say we are pretty fucked
by far the easiest group so we're gonna be the champions
Pretty good, the Dutch are probably the weakest (or at least most beatable) team from pot 1, Ukraine isn't a great team either and the potential playoff teams should be manageable as well
We still have a shit manager though, so it probably won't matter
Aren't Netherlands really good
or am I confusing them with someone else
It's so fitting that of all the months in the year Gay Christmas is in May
> lately
you misspelt "the 80s"
ah, so maybe we got a chance you think
I‘ve heard many from Hufeisen-und (horseshoe-and), to litararisches und (and of literary) or kaufmännisches und (I think that‘s the german name for it: business/businessmans and)
I think most times it‘s just referred to as „und“ (and) or „et“ (and)
This weirdly looks like how our & came to be
[here‘s a picture of it‘s evolution on the german wikipedia site
] It oddly looks like half of the first stage, just a bit reversed
Does anyone have a solution to this
Peace in NI is based on the Good Friday Agreement, as far as I know
So now, that's out the window, because NI is either part of the UK or part of Ireland
What would cause less uproar if Brexit happened, in your opinion
Getting back together with Ireland or staying in the UK
People being constantly negative
Academic titles
You can practice something for an eternity but people will not accept it unless you went to an university and get yourself a fancy title
It does not even matter if it's the same subject
Same here
I hate it
I love how every actual Italian restaurant that is run by actual Italians in Vienna is always full of Italians, most of which are tourists
Like, try something new for once goddammit
And no offense, but personally, I don't like the average Italian's sense of fashion at all
I know many Italians feel superior because of their style, but it's just too *Italian*. It's too flashy and cocky
Sometimes I see a well dressed Italian, nice suit and everything, cool glasses, but then he wears like, neon-green gucci-shoes or shit like that
You can get a country flair in the side bar to the ~~left~~ right ->
Are you from Austria
haha
anyway

You can get a country flair in the sidebar to the right ->
I've made the experience that Italians are even louder
The Spanish get louder than Italians only under the influence of alcohol
Then it gets crazy, especially when Andalucians are involved
They start singing and clapping and stuff
When abroad, Spanish people aren't as loud as Italians
By far
That has 2 reasons
Unlike Italians, the Spanish don't travel in huge groups
Naturally there's less need of speaking loudly
Most Spanish people try not to scream (especially in quiet countries like Austria), because the are afraid that someone might tell them something in English, and then they'd have to respond in English, and they are embarrassed of their English (this applies more to older people though)
Italians tend to give less of a fuck
The loudest fucking people are still drunk English lads though
correct
(: thank you for the information
Andaluzes and Napolitanos are the same culture
Fight me
No, wtf
I've heard it before, especially at night, but it's not something that happens everytime
Never order without onions
fuck how I hate this needless forced banter
it's not "fun", and doesn't improve my or his day or our transaction in any way
still I play along (because you should never be rude to the people preparing your food), but secretly I despise him for that
shut up and just give me my kebap how I ordered it,  kebap man
No, because that's none of their business
You can get a horse Leberkäse in Austria too
Because even back then (1156) vienna was way more important then melk (the capital before vienna)
Damm, never knew Melk was our capital once upon a time
To be fair, it was a bit before I was born
TIL
Honestly thanks for the Wikipedia hole I just fell into, my knowledge on medieval Austria was getting way too rusty
Originally taken from the Avars by Karl the Great, the *[Marcha orientalis] was part of the [Duchy of Bavaria] (itself part of the Frankish empire ruled by Carolingian and Merovingian dynasties, and later part of the HRE)
After having been recaptured from the Magyars in 955, it was ruled by a certain margrave Burkhard
Burkhard was part of a failed uprising against [Otto II] and deposed of in 976
That is when [Leopold I] became margrave, the first in a long line of Austrian rulers from the House of Babenberg
Advancing from the fortress at [Pöchlarn] he started resettling the east of his holdings along the Danube river and its [Wachau] valley, from the original Eastern border somewhere near St
Pölten further downstream up until Fischamend
He also had to secure his lands against internal dissension, and as such reduced the fortress of [Melk] that was still controlled by supporters of the old margrave Burkhard, and subsequently made it his new residence
One of his successors, [Leopold III] made **Klosterneuburg**, the older part of Neuburg (one of the dual cities of [Klosterneuburg] and Korneuburg that had developed by slowly evading the flood-prone plains along the Danube) one of his residences from 1108 onward
After rulers up to his father had resided in Klosterneuburg, [Henry II] (Heinrich Jasomirgott) finally made **Vienna** his residence in 1145/1155 (conflicting Wikipedia entries‽)
Henry II even became Duke of Bavaria for a short while after the Duchy was taken from [Henry the Proud] for not recognizing Conrad III, current King of the HRE
As such, Henry II moved his residence to [Regensburg] capital of the Duchy of Bavaria
After Bavaria was given back to Henry the Proud's line and was therefore taken away from the Babenbergs again, Austria was elevated to the Duchy of Austria as compensation in 1156
In 1192, Leopold V captured Richard Lionheart (of Robin Hood fame) while he was returning from the Crusades, and kept him hostage in [Dürnstein] in the Wachau region
The hefty ransom was used to build a coin mint and finance the first big extension of Vienna as capital
Having already enjoyed economic significance due to its position along the Danube, that intensified in 1221 when the city was given city privileges and [staple right] along with tax exemptions, making it an important commercial hub
In the 14th century, Vienna prospered due to clever policies of [Rudolf IV] (Rudolf the Founder), among them the founding of the University of Vienna (1365), who in doing so tried to compete against the local importance of Prague
Austria subsequently grew and dominated the area (and its capital with it), absorbing the Duchies of Styria and Carinthia that had been founded after the diminishing of the Duchy of Bavaria during emperor [Frederick Barbarossa's] reign in 1156, and ultimately became the [Archduchy of Austria] in 1453
It survived the [sieges of Vienna] by the Turks (1529, 1683) and even the capitulation against the [Hungarians] (1485)
**TL;DR:** If we take Marchia orientalis and Margraviate/Duchy/Archduchy/Empire of Austria as the continuous entity, the capitals were Regensburg, Melk, Klosterneuburg, Wien, Regensburg, Wien
Other important residences were in Steyr, Graz, Linz and Wiener Neustadt
Shifts happened mostly for administrative reasons and because of shifting spheres of influence, and the city gained importance before being made capital because of economic and geopolitical reasons (location, trade) and good economic policies (attracting commerce) as well as investments in infrastructure and research
It managed to stay important even throughout military conflicts due to fortifications, political support by surrounding areas, and sheer luck
Also, in medieval times it's sometimes hard to state what the "capital" of an area is when there's multiple residences with shifting importance, and no administration of the nation state in the modern sense yet
always found it interesting that the Russian capital is so far west, considering the enormous dimensions of Russia
thank you for doing so
this thread has rekindled my interest in late medieval European history
In Austria the most common thing to say would be:
"Das ist mir Wurscht
" / "That's sausage to me
"Das ist mir Powidl
" / "That's plum to me
"Geht mir am Arsch vorbei
" / "This goes past my ass
I had a teacher who would say "das tangiert mich nur peripher" (english: _"this touches me only peripherally"_)
Still my favourite expression of all time
In Austria you may alternatively say "Blunzn" instead of "Wurscht" (both things are used though)
Blunzn is slightly more intense than wurscht (both IRL, the taste, as well as metaphorically the degree of not caring)
Blunzn is a blood sausage, and also a pejorative expression for a stupid or annoying woman
> "Wat weis ick
Woos waß i.
I don't know why everyone (german) forgot "Egal/Mir egal". It is a word apparently only we use and it means I don't care
It's important to note that "Wurschtigkeit" is an Austrian philosophy
Like Alfred Dorfer once said: "The Chinese have Yin and Yang
But we Austrians are developed much further
We have Yin, Yang and Wurscht
Am Arsch, im Arsch oda ins Oarschloch eini
Ned mein Kaffee - not my coffee
Bad teacher then
Wurscht is one of the most used words in (southern) German for that reason
The word is also used in Spanish though
Egal = igual
Me da igual
Is ma blunzn
Sehr gängiger Ausdruck
That is entirely possible
A very very large part of our Austrian kitchen language comes from Bohemia
Because overproportionally many 19th century Czech immigrants worked as cooks
I say me importa un coño, estoy hasta el coño etc
all the time, but I'm a man
I learned most of my Spanish expressions from my girlfriend, so that's what inadvertently had to happen
Ich glaub du hast ein bisschen zu viel Curry auf deiner Wurst gehabt
If you ever learn Spanish as a woman, remember the word coño. It's very important
Golatschen, Palatschinken, Kukuruz, Murken, Kren, Marille (might be Croatian though), Datschi
I think it's Latin>Romanian>Hungarian/German/Czech
The placenta (the things that feeds the baby in utero) is called Plazenta (duh) or Mutterkuchen (literally mother's cake) in German
I've always thought that's such a weird term
Yes yes, that was my point
It's a direct translation because placenta apparently was a kind of cake in ancient Rome
I'm gonna open a beer on that
Prost *clink*
I heard that it was given up when the army realized that as a neutral country they could only use nuclear weapons as a defense on their own soil, and using a nuclear weapons in a small country like Switzerland might be a bad idea
Is that true, or a joke
Not really, they did it themselves
My sub of Skam literally only said to google it rather than trying to explain
Im not convinced
A vanishingly small, politically irrelevant island with a very interesting and unique history and a peculiar native language (a weird sort of "latinized Arabic")
Stefan Zweig - The Royal Game
[The Wall] as it fits the setting ;)
His book "Nachrichten aus einem unbekannten Universum" was great too
It consists of all the scientific facts that didn't fit in "Der Schwarm", very well written too
Schlafes Bruder/Brother of Sleep - Robert Schneider
Well, the word already existed before and described the work/period that a serf had to work for his feudal lord (Corveé in English)
Historically it was used like that in German as well, as a loanword from Czech
But he gave the word the meaning it has today
Ah okay
In German it's just "robot"
Thanks for the clarification
It aint Democratic if it violates the spanish constitution
Why was Bosnia okay but the Crimea isnt
Because the EU doesnt care about legitimacy it cares about her interests
> When you have to jump through this many hoops to pretend you've won, it makes you wonder how strong the case for independence really is
Why not find out
If you are so certain that the majority doesnt want independece, let them vote
Thing is, if it turns out that the Catalans want independece it would be pretty obvious that its you who is jumping through hoops
Am i right
Calling female kids or unmarried women "Fräulein" - a deminishing form of "Frau". For girls it's outdated bordering "old creep"-vibes, using it for grown women is insulting nowadays, because it carries the message that a woman isn't a full woman if she hasn't married
But still some people seem to be tought that this is the appropriate word to use
Funny you mentioned the word "seldom". We actually learned that in school and used it quite frequently in class but I've never heard it in real life
Fräulein, as direct translation from "Miss".
I still had to say it to the elementary school teacher, but nowadays it's only used ironycally (and/or degorative)
German has some grammatical tenses that students have to learn but are really useless
You can live in Austria or Germany for 10 years and never once come across Plusquamperfekt or Futur II
I'm also assuming students are trained to use the Genetiv case much more than natives, because in spoken German it's kind of dying out
That is the only thing I remember from French at school lol
Yeah, they actually taught us this at school
I've only heard it being used in old movies or series
I remember Jeannie in "I dream of Jeannie" use it once lol
my GF is from abroad and studies in Vienna
Whenever she writes a text, I have to correct her phrases with "das Bild von dem Künstler" and put them in genetive (i.e. "das Bild des Künsterls"; "des Künstlers Bild" is too hardcore, even for me)
Not using genetive in written academic German just sounds terrible and wrong
Language schools are not wrong to teach genetive
Even if the case is unnecessary strictly speaking (like so many other things in German), and it's slowly dying out in spoken language, it's still found heavily in written lanugage and it's still an integral part of German
How weird would people look if I just said извини, где библиотека? Would that be rude or something
My Russian is pretty limited
To adress a waiter "Fräulein" is oldfahioned but somewhat ok, if you use it by itself, but don't combine it with the name "Fräulein Mayer".
Our french teacher told us to pronounce it like "J'ai pas"
> I‘m quite sure that I use Plusquamperfekt almost every day
So does Heidi Klum
She OVERuses it actually
It's quite funny actually
Once you know it, you can't unhear it
Plusquamperfekt is a past tense form
There's Perfekt (I have gone), Präteritum (I went) and Plusquamperfekt (I had gone)
Futur II is for looking back from a future time
I will have gone
Both are rarely used in speech, although they occur in books
But when learning a language you want to avoid sounding like you're reading from a book
I probably do in English
Too many latinate words
Yes
Nothing wrong with teaching a bit of "Lokalkolorit" in my opinion, but basically I agree
Im Deutschunterricht, Hochdeutsch
crazy opinion, but I think they should teach *both*. imho it sucks how the everyday spoken language is always treated as an add-on, as something that "can't be studied, you have to experience it", bullshit
and missing study material is not an excuse, I want vocabulary lists for dialectal expressions and proper grammar sections dealing with the differences between standard and colloquial language
I think it's funny
A bit annoying, yes, but funny

Love this clip and I also love that Macron not only tweeted in German today to show his support for Austria, but he also visited our embassy in Paris
I have deep respect for the French people and having spent time on r/France and other French subreddits recently, I wish my self-taught French wasn't too limited to show my sincere appreciation for them and their country
Wow, the EU destroying creativity and progress again /s
Meh, Micro USB-A and USB-C are pretty much standard nowadays
This isn't that big of a deal
ITT: People only reading the headline and not knowing how the EU works
How is a Mobile Device defined
Could companies like Apple get around some sort of restriction by dodging some incredibly specific definition
Like it matters at this point
The only one company that doesn't uses USB C for their new devices is Apple
Might as well call this law the Fuck-Apple Law
Not that I don't enjoy Apple getting some pushback for their shitty closed-off approach, but this still doesn't make this vote any less corrupt
But I thought the EU would hinder innovation by forcing everyone to use USB C? Have I been told lies by these paid shills and apple fanatics in all threads on this topic
What do they use
Because they are either paid advertisers/influencers/astroturfer/whatever they are called these days, or there's already 5% apple kool aid in their bloodstream and they don't want the EU to hurt their good friend Apple
Wow, ok
10h of Merkelwave
What an idiocy
Do cars drive themselves or are driven by people
> The problem is if the city is built with cars
A city built with no cars in mind would be a 3rd world village with no need for logistics, ambulances, garbage collection and fast transport to other places
European cities are pretty nice and sane in this regard
U.S. cities are not build specifically with cars in mind, but with large single-family homes in mind
>  It just that it takes arguably the best metro system in the world and spam of buses, vans, tramps, trolleys etc
I don't think you can repeat it in every city
The public transport system isn't sufficient
The more people live together, the more logistics and services needs they have
The plumber needs to park somewhere, so does the Amazon driver
Especially now that people shop online more and less in the neighbourhood, the need for space for logistics cars will increase
Here in the center of Vienna, during the day I already see more trucks, Ubers, Taxis, Amazon/UPS/other delivery cars than private cars and this trend will continue and increase traffic
Idk without the ads it kinda looks bleak and empty
Maybe I‘m just used to them
The whole debate about "straws" being banned is just so fucking dumb
Unless you're disabled you can easily just not use a straw at all
I really can't remember the last time that I used one
Maybe with a cocktail or something
But then again, just drink beer, so you won't need a straw
Plastic packaging of food items, or non-reusable cups (like in OPs picture) are a far bigger threat
And an even bigger threat are all the one-portion-packages that are being used by greedy companies like Nestlé, etc
in SE-Asia
They sell almost everything portion wise, e.g. Shampoo, coffee, coffee creamer, sugar, etc
etc
And these packings all end up in the oceans

Why does it look so photoshopped
His head seems ridiculously small in comparison to his body
And also as if it was sitting on his left shoulder
It's really more of a destruction site
Here is [another drone image] that shows no signs of fire inside the interior of the church
Is there any information on the extent of the fire in the interior
The interior of the north tower is now on fire, [pictures from France 24]
This is unfortunate
I used a break of a few hours to visit Notre Dame on the way between train stations but had to cut that short as i had to catch the last train towards Scotland
Now at least parts of the Nave seem to be gone
The [photo on the frontpage of La Liberation] shows the Rosette window of the transept burnt through, so the interior, not only the roof seems to be burning
As the BBC had to quote some American on water and airplanes, I switched to the [livestream of France 24] which is actually understandable with moderate French skills
man this is a tragedy i hope they are able to rebuild it after this
Thank you for these clarifications
It's horrible what's happening
The silver is from me
The ceiling seems to be intact towards the towards - here is an image for [comparison] It's however difficult to guess if the spire fell through the ceiling but if this was the case, there would be flames coming from the windows of the Nave itself
You can see the rounded structure of the vault, that forms the ceiling, here is [a picture for comparisson
] If the interior was on fire, it would be visible through the windows at the side of the nave or the large rosette window of the transept
There was this very unfortunate episode where Daesh amassed hordes that pushed back the Syrian troops that had recaptured it and then went to complete the destruction of some of the historic sites

Welcome to the Club
Sebastian Kurz, the (ex- and- not- yet) Chancellor of Austria is 33 years old
Kurz is not currently Chancellor of Austria, [Brigitte Bierlein] is
Bella gerant alii, tu felix Austria nube
However, Kurz will most likely retake the position as chancellor before his 34
birthday
except if the coalition talks take a huge amount of time (his birthday is next august)
yeah, same with Germany
politically and organizationally it's the same thing, just a different name for the position; or rather, for some reason a specific English translation exists for the position
take ireland for example, the position of Taoiseach gets translated as "prime minister" even though the position is only comparable to that of a prime minister in Anglo countries (and nowadays, often doesn't get translated at all)
soy to summarize:
translation to the English term of prime minister is always only an approximation, actual responsibilities might differ depending on country
heads of state that don't have a presidential system (like US, France, since recently Turkey) could *all* be translated as "prime minister"
for some reason, countries with a Chancellor get their own translation
other countries' top leader positions seem to get translated less nowadays as well
Because its just a "temporary" government
They cant get laws through our parliament like a normal government can
Well, they voted for his party - chancellors in Austria are appointed, not voted upon
I never understood why the Turkish are so stubbornly denying the Armenian genocide
Just admit it ffs
I mean pretty much all of our grandparents and great grandparents were pretty much a bunch of assholes, commiting all kind of atrocities, especially during WW 1&2, and tbh it won't be a big loss for the world to see a generation raised by racism and overflowing nationalism gone
But their actions neither define me as a person, nor do they represent the modern day progressive country I live in
I will only be accountable for my own actions, not those of others
So if you're not a racist lunatic yourself, you shouldn't have much trouble accepting the evil deeds of people that are all long dead by now
Had a big BD this year too
Missed that one and prolly next year too
Rip
Me too, happened while I was alone in self-isolation in the UK
Sad feelings and gin tonics were had

\*Stay strong and be cool .
I've heard about British humor
They really are funny :)
Freudian slip
UdssR won the space race
Thats not debatable imo, but thats a nice view, humanity won the space race
I like that
I don't know why (i haven't even been to paris) but somehow I also was in total shock yesterday, as if something terrible happened to me personaly
Maybe it was just the feeling that a wonderful piece of our culture might have been lost
However hopefully we all will help together to rebuild it as beautiful as it once was
If you want to be an outdoor cat, then go out of the door and leave for god's sake
Don't continue to stand around in the house demanding that before leaving, the owner promise to deliver free food and water to you for years, keep the door wide open for whenever you need something from his house, and maybe even provide you with a harem of lady cats
If you want to go, go already
No one's stopping you but yourselves
Oh, I'm not bothered
I'm rather questioning myself how much longer the UK strives to compete with the Trump administration in terms of who can manage to come up with the more laughable and embarrassing political disaster
And of course the people of the UK should be bothered, because their livelihood is at stake and their ruling government proves to be completely clueless as how to further proceed, but toodles, amirite
> Political disaster
Europe is now full of far-right nationalist populist parties with prominent positions and even governing
And surprisingly, none of them are even close to doing anything so incredibly disastrous that it has made worldwide headlines for several years at a time
When your government is doing such a terrible job that they even make fucking Matteo Salvini look like a competent person who knows what he's doing, something is seriously not going well
> and you think the UK having difficulties leaving an economic union as laughable and as embarrassing as Trump
Well, there's a reason why Trump and Brexit are by far the biggest laughing stocks in any relevant political comedy programme around the globe
It certainly isn't for their incredible success
> Austria in particular, c’mon, glass houses doesn’t even come close…
Considering that the elections are due in five days, that things are presumed to go back to business as usual pretty soon, that the moron causing the trouble in the first place has had his career squashed (instead of being elected Head of Government like Johnson was), and that the shitshow here isn't even close to taking as long or being as much of a global embarrassment as Brexit is (it is a pretty hard facepalm for the local population, I'll give you that one), I do think the comparison is quite a bit unfair
This is a clever way to say that democracy doesn't actually exist
I'd love to see a second vote just because I want to see how the pro-brexit guys wanna make people believe it is a good thing this time
Since most of the shit they told last time has already been proven wrong
I do genuinely hope for you fellow people in the UK that you get another chance to vote
Not because what I just said above but because of the distribution the vote showed
The old people said leave, the young prefered stay
Now thats just like climate: The old guys give a fuck about it, the young ones realize how important it is
for germans: thats 4,3 Merkels
Come on Iran, everybody knows that devils and fiends have horns
Although that would make him look like a Tiefling, which would make him look cool again
Do those guys really think, that they can Insult Macron with a cartoon like this
The only insult that would work is one, that plays with his mommy issues
Or maybe his ancestors struck a pact with Asmodeus and now he can cast the Thaumaturgy cantrip
I would put wstonia in good results
Dude, Kosovo is recognized by almost every EU country and even if it isn't, it's certainly not ruled by Serbia in a way that would make the data applicable
No, she actually did choose the thug life, she wanted this job
Question: why not look for a planet b?
Yeah but it's going to be the only long term solution anyway
Why not push for space exploration
Yeah it's pretty obvious that speed alone won't get us far but the general public doesn't seem to care about it anyways
That would need to change
There are many ways we could still travel there in seconds
No of course not,  I mean we don't completely know what is possible and what not but wormholes and similar theories about changing space itself leave a lot of possible ways open
And quantum mechanics make even the craziest things possible (i. e. quantum entanglement)

That’s just another one of those „My COVID-19 project“ bragging pictures
I’m from Vienna
When I was a child, we always kept  a shovel in the car from ~November - March to shovel out parking spaces due to the regular snowfall
So far, we had snow twice this year, maybe 1-2 cm and all gone the next day
This January, we only had below freezing during daylight hours for maybe 4 or 5 days
Just had lunch outside without a jacket since it’s 13 degrees
I’m only in my twenties, but even I can definitely feel in shift in climate over here, and it’s not just this year
The changes are getting more pronounced every year
Glad that there is no climate change
At all
*sarcasm off*
12°C in Vienna, it's absolutely insane
A few degrees less in the countryside where my mom lives - but usually, they'd be buried in snow there this time of the year
A few flakes around Christmas is all we got
This is fucking disgusting to me
I just want a few damn weeks of winter and snowy weather
I was in Edinburgh last week and it was snowing quite a lot even though I lived right next to the sea where it is apparently not so common to snow
Also, Edinburgh Castle was closed for a day because they deemed it unsafe because of the weather
Now I am back in Vienna and it is like 12 degrees
probably not global warming, probably
> What the blazes is going on
Have you heard about our lord and savior "greenhous gases"?
I've always wanted to move to the mediterranean, now the mediterranean is moving to me
If the sea levels rise enough, we Austrians will get our sweet sea access back again without having to start another world war
id call that a win-win situation for us
I am also from Vienna and in my early twentys and it is shocking to think how much snow I experienced as a child and generally how different the seasons were
Last year, February was probably the coldest month in the winter season while January was very warm and this year we can drink our coffee outside
It is flabbergasting
Edit: spelling
This is the NEW normal
No, this will no change back during your lifetime
Whatever you do, it will likely not change it for the better - at most it will get worse more slowly
Yeah but we would all have to spend more money on air conditioning in summer so it's a stupid conspiracy

Dude, in Austria, our Health Minister has called off a resolution that would have banned cigarette smoking inside bars and restaurants, citing "freedom of choosing". That same person is the Social Minister and said that 150 Euros a month is "well enough for a sustainable life". Sometimes reality is the best satire
Well, let them special snowflakes be special
Incredible caricature

Austria numbah one
The big fight of our generation is starting
Right-wing parties really are the same everywhere
Exactly the same shit was rushed through the Austrian parliament recently, with the same arguments: "It enables people to work more hours if they want to, VOLUNTARILY
It took maybe 2 weeks before the first reports came of people being let go because they didn't VOLUNTEER to work 4 hours more per day
And it's always the parties that disguise themselves as the "party of the small man".
*surprised Pikachu face*
Exactly
Always be wary of the police, even though they are blue-collar ("What is a riot
A bayonet with a worker at both ends" -Lenin), they consider themselves an elevated class of society and have historically *always* been the defenders of the status quo, from the Roman Slave Empires to Nazi Germany to the Segregated South
They are not the friends of progress and they certainly aren't the friends of the downtrodden and destitute
Oh, thanks
Well, that’s kind of a problem, no

The first blood moon I had in that game was the scariest shit ever
I went out of Kakariko and along a long stone path, and at the end of it I saw a Lynel, a monster I'd never seen before (At that point it basically just looked like a miniature Ganon)
It was walking around in the distance, so I thought it didn't see me
Suddenly, it had a question mark over its head
Then an exclamation mark
I swear, as soon as it spotted me, a blood moon happened and I had no fucking idea what was going on
I thought the Lynel somehow caused the blood moon
well it's called iceland, not snowland
Would not be different in any other country, including the US
From the russian point of view he tries to destabilize the government with fabricated stories about an assassination (honestly, that phonecall was too much
It was so obviously staged that it's even ridiculous that so many are believing it
Just as the Gas-Container-Stories in syria from bellingcat)
And i read in our newspaper sentences like: he was threatened with violence if he did not let himself get arrested

I can get a flight from Vienna to Amsterdam and back for <100€. The whole thing takes ~6 hours if you account for getting to the airport, security, the actual flight, then getting out of the plane and going from the airport into the City
The train costs ~120€ one way and takes 12 hours just for the train ride
So unless I can get a train both ways for <50€ they are gonna have a hard time
Currently I don't travel by train because it's so expensive
One person driving from let's say Vienna to Venice costs more than 2 people flying there and back again and it's much longer
Just not worth it
Please fix czechias railway first
Thanks
Problem is, you would need consent of every member state the get rid of the VAT exemption for air travel and that is no very realistic
If you look at the graphs for European countries and the US, the difference is just extreme
In Europe, you have a slow rise to a frighteningly high number and then a sharp drop after measures were introduced

Any democracy that has any worth would have seen the massive protests the first time, and accepted that the people don't want this(for now anyway, I expect it to show up again on the EU agendas in a decade or so)
But the USA gov
Doesn't serve the people, and NN is a perfect example to demonstrate that
Also, I'm really sick and tired of being told to call my congressman
I did(I specifically voted for a party that said it would vote for net neutrality), we cemented NN(well somewhat, zero rate is still allowed) and just because the American Royalty won't accept it, I still have to see this shit everywhere on my internet, that is safe in a proper NN accepting union
End rant, stay safe Americans, and I hope you can power through this *attack on your freedom
Until Oettinger comes around

For people who are interested, here's the shortened, [actual hymn version] with English lyrics if you turn on annotations
There's also an interesting [alternative version with Latin lyrics] that I also like very much, it just sounds awesome (for a translation check out the video comment)
Last but not least, check out this nice [non-vocal flashmob version] that illustrates quite nicely on an emotional level why we can deem ourselves so happy to have something like the EU
You're totally correct, the Council of Ministers and any EU body representing the governments (like the Commission) is as shit/corrupt/lobby-influenced as the single country's governments
But that is especially why the EU has so much potential, because it is something greater that the single governments - take the European Parliament for example, time and time again it has shown that it's [voting with the best interest of the European people at heart] (unlike the commission, which is representing the EU's governments)
That is actually remarkable
I think it has to do with the way EMPs are sent there, and how they don't feel as much pressure to vote in line with their party/coalition as they would at home
Seems like independently voting MPs are really not so bad after all
Here's also a [great article about Margrethe Vestager] one of the good people in the Commission
She's a prime example of how the EU can be great if we send the right people there; freed from the pressures of national politics, they can actually work *for* the people they represent
It's kinda sad that this has to feel so surprising
but even more so I'm happy we have people like her and [Ansip] in the Commission
So very different from people like Oettinger and the Agriculture guy, I guess that's why shit like the Monsanto story still happen
[Here's something to feel wholesome to, we're all in this together <3]
On a more serious note, here's a nice article about [Margrethe Vestager] one of the EU's politicians that I think would just not be possible on a national level
Working *for* the people she represents, fuck, why does this have to feel so surprising
Here is a [version with English lyrics] if you turn on annotations
Or, just because I'm guessing you're speaking Italian, you might be interested in this [alternative version with latin lyrics] with the Italian down in the comment
Yes that's correct, sorry if I wasn't clear about that; it's an alternative version, a fan project if you will
Still sounds nice I think

Can we now get back to something about Europe
I don't go to a European subreddit so I get informed about the god damn American election
He's not and people will soon find out
But they voted for him only to get rid of Trump, not for his own merits, so they won't feel responsible
For now, Americans don't like losers and Trump has lost
What's "wrong" in your opinion is that he is for due process and not this crazy "whatever the media say" thing
There's nothing crazy about the lawsuits
If the situation had the parties swapped with all the irregularities we've seen, you and all other bigots would be screaming about it
And politicians are just being polite
But to be honest, I don't really care how many ignorant people are cheering about the corrupt, unsafe near children and senile guy (whose VP basically called him a rapist a while ago) who has just been called projected president elect
The proof is in the pudding as they say, your comment and all the others will probably be readable still when the world realizes how Biden actually is
Oh, tell me more
What's indicative of the alternate reality
The Joe Biden everyone can see and hear on video, or the bubble deniers like you are living in
Do you need help finding those videos or are you happy to just believe it's all not true
So, your only argument is that you are ignorant and rude
Good job
Muslim from a european country here, this is bullshit
Edit: I just read that you meant the ones in the middle east, not in europe
Pardon me, I would have to agree on your statement
The fact that european muslims support terrorists
every single muslim I've met, and I've met about 50 or more, despises ISIS and other radical muslims
Not sure about your sources tho
Eidt: I've actually misread something, Pardon me
After meeting People in Egypt it is true that some hhave hidden sympathies for ISIS, unfortunately
I corrected my comment
Nah it's just that every single one of them is on this protest /s
ahhh, da old country
Americans tended to name cities after the places they came from, sometimes even entire countries
So maybe they thought that Italy, France was just as normal as Norway, Michigan

Next step: stop people from getting sued for memes
As an Austrian, I think it should be noted that Ms
Zechner wasn't chosen because shes's a woman but because she was closer to the SPÖ party
Franzmayr didn't get the job due to his ties to the FPÖ party
And of course doing a numerical rating of qualification on a quarter-percent scale is completely bonkers (i.e. this rating is an accurate measure of the candidate's aptitude for fitting in the rating system, which probably has some kind of correlation with the candidate's aptitude to do the job in question)
But if a ministry does use such an absurdly fine scale, it is obviously bound by it, duh
Really good comment
I hope more people see this
As you describe it people don't think these things through
It feels like an impulsive decision based on current politics about gender
I'd like to see them defend their position against other factors like height or attractiveness, because we know people treat others differently in regard to those attributes
We should just stop all road construction unless 50% of workers are female
Suddenly, many more well paid female workers
But in politics and media it's only about high paying white collar jobs
Or we have ~~slave labour~~ a conscription military, which only the men have to slave away in, nobody is asking for equality there, making this sex/gender irrelevant would be a landmark decision towards equality
It's just hypocrisy and sexism all the way down
I just wish we wouldn't import all this gender extremism from countries like the USA, and instead work for actual equality
Meh, nothing special here, same shit as everywhere

Austrian citizen since 1984
The final court decision was not only about the difference, but that the former minister insisted on hiring the woman over him because she wanted to have a female for the job
you can now also say that if a company hiring a male over a female they are more careful and never official say that the decision was because of the gender and not qualification
It would have been different if they would have used other arguments
The court just said now that preferring a less qualified person because of gender is discrimination no matter if the person is female or male
Hey, we got proper healthcare and low crime rates, don't chuck us into the same bucket like those crazies over the pond

The whole political process in the US is a clownery through and through
I don't want to make this point a "Europe good, US bad", but damn, the US system is horrible
So why is Austria almost always missing from these lists
You misspelled Austria
Poland and Hungary think the system works well
What a surprise
Also the complete lack of Congress and Senate term limits, almost completely unlimited freedom for social media providers to control public opinion and spread false information without repercussion, the fact that elected officials are sparsely to not at all held accountable for corruption and spreading lies and conspiracy theories
the list goes on
The reasoning for the US election system has been outdated for quite over a century
At this point there's no reason to still cling to the electoral college
States don't elect the president, people do
It doesn't matter where the people come from, as long as they're eligible to vote, their vote should count as much as everyone else's. The people of New York or California are not a monolith, just because they have bigger numbers doesn't mean they should handicapped in comparison to other states
How generous, you are allowed to take unpaid time off so you can try to figure out how to magically pay for your ridiculous medical bills
>Try being a software dev in Europe compared to the US
Now try being poor in the US compared to Europe
Sure, your "economy" might be better but at the expense of the people
If you are well-off the US may be "better" individually speaking
But if not, good luck
The US is a very individual-focused country and I don't think this is good for the majority of people in the big picture
But that's exactly what it does
Every vote should have the exact same value, because the people vote, not the state
The electoral college makes sure that they don't do, attributing different values based on the state
It shouldn't matter whether the winning 75 million votes came from one state, ten, or all of them, what matters is that that many people voted for a certain candidate

Fuck man you're asking alot from me
I'm gonna try to translate the last 5 posts from his instagram page
* the terror attacks are based on Islam (he's saying not all muslims are terrorist, but the people doing the terror attacks in europe are muslims)
* making a law against "political islam" (no fucking idea if that's a real word), basically making it illegal to be a radical islamist
* making a sort of list of radical imams (I think, could have understood that wrong)
* Keeping a big eye out on the people that where released after "not beeing" radical anymore
* taking the citizenship away from terrorists
* taking away their drivers licence
* the possibility to close mosques
* making some symbols illegal
I think that's all
If someone here speaks german they can try to translate it if they want

The funny thing is, there are a lot germans with let's say rather "right-of-center ideology" in parts of eastern germany
He did nazi that coming
EXTREMLY terrible
Innocent people getting punched by extremist terrorists
Should be met with a prison sentence, unbelievable
You can't go around punching people because they have other ideologies
That's even more nazi-like
It's not a political thing though
In Germany being a Nazi is outlawed, so punching someone doing a Hitler salute is not any different than punching a robber
We have a saying: "Fascism is no opinion but a crime"
>And I'd argue that doing a Nazi salute does not make you a Nazi
Only a fucking idiot if you're doing it in Germany
>The yank most likely thought it would be fun to do the Nazi Salute in Germany
If you're commiting a crime because you're an idiot you are still commiting a crime even if you don't know any better
>> so punching someone doing a Hitler salute is not any different than punching a robber
>I'd argue that there is a massive difference
A robber has the potential to harm you
An idiot doing a Nazi salute does not
Criminal is criminal
If the thing you believe in is outlawed then it just might be that you deserve some punches, the same as a robber or a thief deserves it
Most of the countries in Europe give much more to their state television annually, they just don't get bad press for it (instead they get bad press if they want to spend less on government propaganda)
The "instead of cancer treatment" is an interesting framing, as if they didn't have any other money
Very disingenuous
Watch more ARD, ZDF and you'll probably discover it isn't any different from what the Germans get these days
Inb4 it was the state that funded the attack because one lord one bought a drone and didn't have fun with it
When I look at America all I see are the black dots from this chart

I don't think the stereotypical European parliament has that many parties because some won't make it in countries that have thresholds
Austria - our thunbergistans are only going to be part of parliament again after the next vote
in america you got racist and less racist as options so
Well it can be really limiting in certain situations
Its like a chaos stability
You have Stalinists
What the fuck
Not really as populism actually means that the party is just using it to get voted and do not really believe it (like some left-wing parties are doing it to overcome right-wing dominance)
Calling those right-wing parties populist is kind of dangerous as people could get the feeling that they don't really mean it, which is not true

TIL Arnie war auch ein Schwarzkappelzwerg
Austria is a nice looking country but the politics are just dogshit, corruption everywhere
I wanna leave Austria after my uni as well
Another reason for me to leave Austria is, I'm studying engineering and there are not many jobs (except I accept one with like 2-3k/month)
Even as an Austrian, his Styrian accent is quite amusing
The thing is, there isn't really such a thing as "Austrian accent" since the dialect vary so much in Austria
Arnie has a typical styrian dialect, which for example is totally differen from a tyrolean dialect
And of course totally different from the Vorarlberg dialect, but nobody in Austria except for themselves understand the people from Vorarlberg anyways
size-wise, yeah it's a village
but categories of distance and remoteness work differently here
I grew up in an Austrian village with 200 inhabitants and we'd call it going "into town" when we took the car to drive over three hills and past two villages to make it to the next one that even had a bakery and an ATM – but in this community we're still mostly university educated commuters working in the city, nothing bumhicksville-esque about it
but on the other hand, the "city" itself is only a town with 20k inhabitants and probably fulfills more characteristics of a US suburb than of let's say NYC
in short, things are hard to compare
>except I accept one with like 2-3k/month
What do you expect
You are fresh of the Uni, you know shit
Why should you earn more then a worker with decades of experience
Politics wasn't always that shitty/corrupt
It was on a very okay-ish level before Kurz got govermental responsibility
The politics in the 70s/80s were also very good for it's time, especially under chancellor Kreisky
I would never want to leave Austria without a good reason
We have high standards in medicine, social security and labour rights (way above EU minimum standards)
Also compared to other western european countries good wages and a high GDP (#5 in the EU)
Heast Oida
Bussi
Not the one you ask, but as an Austrian myself, I find that many people around here think quite fondly of Arnie
He rarely comes up on like the news or anything, and many people probably do think of him as more American than Austrian, but at the same time he is seen as a great example of being able to do whatever you want as long as you put yourself out there and are proactive
Yes
Austria isn't even particularly bad in that regard
(Rank 15 in the corruption perception index
Tho we might be in for a drop because the government is having a corruption scandal right now
Idk how correct that is but the starting salary is around 4-6k so why should I pass on money that would be dumb or
I'd also say that while politics could be better, they could also be much worse when looking at other countries
Kurz fucked up a lot
I not happy with our politics atm but I hope that it will be better when he leaves the government
That's true, I'm extremly happy about that we have such high standards, I dont hate Austria by any way, I love it but I'm not happy how things are at the moment, I can't really change it sadly but tbh I always wanted to leave Austria and explore new countries .
Yeah, but then you're in the US
with all pros and cons that entails
Around 50k in Austria
But the DACH System of workforce education is so completly different from the US (and many other countries) i have given up any comparison
I am pretty sure that a lot of the stuff that american engineers do is often done by normal worker (Facharbeiter) in Austria or germany
I mean most workplaces hold someone with a "Meister" title in higher regards then a fresh engineer and rightfully so in my opinion
Poor you
20 years and you ended up in the wrong (bigger, but worse) part of Austria
Wish you all the best still
Yeah, get used to that
We dont like germans

As I expected
Always expect the ÖVP to vote against the best interest of the common worker/employee
How is this in _any way_ sursprising
I wouldn't really call NEOS neoliberal
Sure, that might be fringe part of former ÖVP members, but neither Strolz nor Meinl-Reisinger are excessively right-wing, economically speaking
Is that why they oppose the 12 hour day

Otherwise there would have been substantial change long ago
What most people care about however is the children they selfishly brought into this world, and them not having to subsist in some kind climate war hellscape

this *always* comes up; yet in reality, Burma uses its own system, and Liberia just doesn't have a nationally defined standard (yet has strong economic ties to imperial-using countries, therefore that system is often used, among others)

Do you have a source for that
A couple of days ago I read that top is Japan with 13 ICU beds per *1000 residents, my country (Austria) is in the middle with 7 beds per *1000 residents and the US ranges quite low with 2
8 beds per *1000 residents
Edit: numbers were per 1000 residents, not per capita
Edit: So, I figured why the numbers were so different from another
Apparantly what I read considered all hospital beds, not ICU beds
I think it was necessary because most people don’t instantly think of the US when you talk about countries with poor infrastructure and health care
I read your link and it really doesn't look good for the USA if you consider that you spend more than double the amount on healthcare than most other countires
it’s more the inaccessibility of health care that’s made fun of, not necessarily the quality
and as europeans i don’t think we can quite imagine how bad it is, because we are so used to accessible high quality health care
I know you guys are very patriotic and you definitely have good health care specialists and all that, but the health care infrastructure can’t be compared to europe
i spent 16 days in the ICU with a life threatening situation, got a ride in the ambulance, got a shit ton of meds, 2 MRIs, 2 cat scans and an angiography during that time
guess what, it was for free
then there are americans i met through my self help group concerning my disease that couldn’t even afford to call an ambulance (despite working 2 jobs AND having insurance
) as they were suffering from an active brain haemorrhage that could’ve killed them
is that good health care infrastructure in your eyes
Please, the US looks at Europe like we’re a lost cause and shows 0 respect
Saying that the USA are an example of worse health care is just the truth
It would be worse if Norway wasn’t making it clear and lots of their students end up surviving COVID 19 in the USA just to come back with crippling debt
we’re far from that clowns level, the statement seems tactful enough in my eyes considering the situation
but that’s just my opinion
Entertainment Propaganda works

Yea, it's a Meme-abomination stemming from r/Austria
The marmalade is still in there, but they probably added mustard and pickles to it
who knows
I'm an Austrian and the popularity of this meme is beyond me
Probably it's because i'm far older than the average Austrian redditor and as such see combining massive amounts of sugar, fat and meat of questionable source more as a major health risk than a good idea to put in your mouth

We're in the transition phase of adapting to a self inflicted rapid change of our environment
If we can't adapt and/or fix it, we will be like dinosaurs, but there's one big difference: We have the means to do sth
about it, and humans will
There is just not enough panic yet
Ok - there is the unchangeable difference in how we believe the world works: I truly believe that disparities are necessary for the world to work
You think it's a glitch in the system, that should be overcome
From my pov, if we delete disparities, the world would stop existing after a few hundred years
I'm a true believer in evolution - biological, social and economical
And yes, I am very well aware of how unfair this is, and that both of us live on the upper side of things
(Aka our privilege)
1st) I have 2 masters, 1 in economics and the other one in communications (that's the lesser one
) - it's probably hard for you to understand how I could possibly have the opinion I have
Actually maybe this helps: I grew up around left-wing politics my whole life (my parents are both politicians) so I know this game inside-out and I am very well aware of the weaknesses of classic left policies (as well as classic right policies)
2nd) I don't consider myself extreme in any kind of way
Actually pretty centristic
I am absolutely pro social-state politics and helping people in need
But, and this is a big but: We (as a country / group of central european countries) have already reached the sweet spot
It doesn't get any better
There are details here and there, that need to be fixed, absolutely
But the general level of redistributing whealth is just about right
If you think this is a right wing position (that I don't want more redistribution) then please open a history book and compare actual numbers, laws, etc
Today vs
the decades before
3) I lost you when you started talking about an illusion, that would shatter, once I had access to education
Please elaborate (if still relevant after reading 1+2)

Except for Vienna
Sadly its raining at my place :(
While in Vienna, no signs of snow
And Here in lower austria we got nothing ;(
Its totally fine, we once had more snow almost 20 years ago, and i loved digging tunnels as a kid
Vienna can't complain
Bitch, where
I haven't seen snow in a year
Just like in Vienna
Just take it to eastern austria, we are dry too
Luckily, maybe
We had plenty of snow a few days ago, getting more would be difficult to manage
It's only great if you go skiing
The snowpack probably not entirely sedimentary snow, but of aeolian origin
But yeah, the past week was pretty sick snow wise

Putin likes to kill with low dose Polonium 210
There basically is not a dose that that is non-lethal (1/1000 of a gram, invisible to the human eye

Crazy how important German tourists are for many economies

I've spent about a week or so reading through frugal opinions here, trying to figure out if they might know a thing or two I didn't but I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that it's just indignant talk you can hear at your local pub
the fuck do you expect your economy to grow without massive public spending
Exactly
We should have all laid back and watch our economies go down the drain
once their debt reaches a critical level they'll have to default but honestly, this concept of repaying debts is so 1920's.
Frugals really are confident idiots
He's been on my TV screen way too little
It was planned to reintroduce face mask requirements on Sunday, but either Kurz is against it or, worse, he just wants to be at the press conference personally announcing it
that's not how fiscal policy works
Public spending always works as an imprest
>he just wants to be at the press conference personally announcing it
Search your feelings, you know it to be true
He desperately wants to be the strong and stable leader during crisis, so crisis gets to go on until it fits into his schedule
Doubt he's against it after the lockdown and previous facemask requirements
At most some industries will get exceptions but i have my doubts even there
that depends on how much money you collect in the end
No economy ever rebuilt itself from austerity
can't stop the bleeding with an arrow in your stomach
how dumb do you think I am, austerity is the wrong tool to deploy in a crisis
You were taking austerity as a metaphor to stop the bleeding, i.e. stop the indebtedness and the lowering of creditworthiness, at least that's what I got from it which is why I pointed to the fact that it's useless if you don't even get the opportunity to rebuild the economy in the first place

Get some Belgian towels instead and swap them with them
See if they recognise the difference
Or as an Austrian I would just use one of these chairs and when they complain, I would tell them, that even though we don´t want a reunion with Germany anymore I appreciate their thought of reserving a place for us Austrians too
Seeing this you'd think they're good at invading
You know it's your obligation to throw all these towels on a big pile, then watch them fight each other to their deaths
Throw it in the pool
I don´t think anyone would care about that disrespect
It´s not like in the US where they make such a fuss about the flag
Quite the opposite actually
Reveering the flag like Americans do would be considered creepy
just burn it and replace it with austrian towels to assemble doninace
But it's a rule that basically gives you the power to ignore others, so it's fine
now I'm wondering about the required thickness of cloth that makes a flag not a flag, or makes a towel a flag instead
I don´t think hardly any German (unless he is extremely patriotic which is rather rare) would even bat an eye if you tossed an actual flag into the pool
Of course it is suprising but we will accept your surrender and start to integrate you into our Austrian empire

The most mind-boggling thing is that so many pro-Brexiteers were, and *still are* of the opinion that the UK has an advantageous negotiating position
Honestly, props to Boris Johnson & Entourage
Such a level of brainwashing has rarely been reached
The best thing was when they compared EU exports *to* the UK and EU imports *from* the UK using absolute figures - completely forgetting that the EU is 27 countries and the UK one
You have *got* to be shitting me
The EU's immense bureaucracy has so far managed to be way more effective at communicating clear divorce guidelines than May's coalition of disaster
44% of UK exports, God damn it
Imagine half of all exports suddenly becoming subject to high import tariffs
We're talking about a recession of Great Depression proportions
And again, the EU is the larger bloc
Mayne it's slightly slower at negotiating than the UK, but still from a more powerful standpoint, since it makes up pretty much half of the developed world

We also use "It's a spanish village to me" (like the balkans)
Maybe it's just me but the railway thing sounds very much like Germany
At least in Austria we are also saying "those are bohemian villages to me".
"Das sind für mich böhmische Dörfer"
but German speakers *do* have a language-related idiom (Spanish, just like the Balkans and Hungary) - we just happen to also have the railway station one
We also have "Am I talking Chinese or something
" when we feel like we've sufficiently expressed ourselves and are still not understood
At least in Austria we use both
I only understand railway station and
It seems spanish to me
Not sure if Germany is the same
Why is the Chinese character for Love (愛) on Russia
Smells like propaganda
Seriously why *is* it there
It's oddly fitting and completely out of place at the same time
Germans and Austrians use spanish too
Stop fucking putting Austria and Switzerland into the same "pot" as Germany
Germans have their own ugly stupid language and the example given is a prime example on why its stupid
Nobody in Austria would say that
If you said that, people would laugh at you and call you stupid german
Interestingly, we also have Kauderwelsch in German
I always thought of it as a north German expression
Didn't know it came from a Swiss city
Although the spelling of Volapük is not correct on the map, ‘volapyk’ is definitely wrong in English

Here is the video I stole this from without a license:
Yeah, but you don't give up on democracy in your country because some politicians voted for a shit law
You vote for politicians who will best represent your interests
Only if any of them have content filters according to EU guidelines
Much more likely is them just blocking any european IPs
It is way too expensive for sites like Imgur to either manually or automatically review every single one of their uploads for any copyright infringements
Yeah, you can criticize democracy all you want, but I'd be interested in the alternatives
Because the EU parliament is democratically elected
Yeah, of course, is that too complicated for you
Who voted this bill into law -> European Parliament
Who did we vote for -> European Parliament
"Europe broke, how could this pass, so bad hurrdurr" is in essence calling this democratic system broken
It seems you've somewhere along the way missed the connection between my first comment and the following chain of comments
You can criticize politicians for their decisions, you can't criticize the whole of the EU for decisions of a number of democratically elected politicians without also attacking the whole process by which they were chosen

When I am in my car or on foot, most people on bicycles seem like idiots, running red lights, speeding in pedestrian areas, driving over pedestrian crossings
Hawara
Everyone is shitty
There's a link from a week or so ago over on /r/fahrrad quoting a study in, I believe Germany, that over 95% of all citizens asked (pedestrians, cyclists and motorists) said they regularly break the law
Just today as I was going out on a ride, I almost got hit by a car cutting me off during a turn into a bike lane as I was leaving the regular road
This week I did a bunch of cycling in the center of Vienna and counted several cars, bikes and pedestrians not following various rules (almost hit a ped because of their flagrant disregard for the rules)
Everyone is bad
The police need to enforce lights on bikes at night (almost hit a few bikes while on my own bike because of this)
The police need to be better about enforcing speeding of cars
Pedestrians need to be especially aware of their surroundings when using paths marked for both them and bikes
> Everyone is bad
The thing is, the idiot traffic planners today make things worse because instead of working to prevent conflicts, they actively encourage them with their measures
Many bike lane crossings with streets are very difficult to look far enough into to prevent accidents with fast-riding cyclists, for example
Or painting bike lanes next to parking spots, or on already very narrow streets, is just asking for trouble
You have to remember that there are also lots of places in Europe that are simply very old and trying to bolt another generation of infrastructure onto something that is already a few hundred years old isn't very easy
That is not an excuse for doing stupid things
Take away: we're equally stupid, we just need longer to start the stupid

Health problems, was close to a burn out and he and his family got numerous death threats
Probably not that experienced in wearing suits and has to look absolute perfect in a few minutes
Just a wild guess if I had to wear his shoes
It's more likely the stress and strain of the job that might do him in
That's what happened to the last one at least
Thats not how that works
It’s common even for high ranking politicians to use public transport in Austria
Resigned because of health reasons (burn out) and because he received numerous death threats
In Austria they really aren't rare
For example, this sub has seen Van der Bellen countless times in public transport
The green party has its fair share of hypocrites too, it's  pleasantly surprising I'd say
He's been seen in the U1 (subway line) too
He's a medical doctor, so most likely vaccinated by now
Also the smear infection risk was grossly overstated in the beginning of the pandemic
to not touch the handles, even without a pandemic raging I rather not touch the handles if I can avoid it
I know how often you have to refill the soap in the men's room, and it's not nearly frequent enough for every 3rd person to use soap in there
Because of the Covid restrictions he implemented
They were necessary of course, but not everyone agreed on that matter
Some idiots disagreed even more and threatened him
A minister is not directly elected by the people, so he doesn't care for votes
At least thats how it is in Austria
No they are not
And don’t say that I’m gullible to believe that
It happens in many countries that way
Yes, but if I was that concerned (and not vaccinated), I would rather ride my bike there than taking the tram
If you view it like that yes you are right
I didnt think about that
This is the most idiotic thing I have ever seen a country do
How much did it cost to do this
How about we pay health-workers the amount they deserve for the hard work they are doing
Idiots

Can we also talk about how the EU budget is not a black hole
You pay into a budget that also has things in it FOR YOU
The 215bn were not lost
A huge precentage of it came back into the UK as science-, agriculture- and infrastructure funding
Sure you dont get everything back as a net contributor, but lets stop pretending that every single euro (or pound) paid into the EU is lost
Its just plain wrong
/rant
The UK really should just form sort of economic union with Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
The UK never belonged in the EU, and that is fine, but BJ also should not force the UK into some deal with the US
Bad idea
Strong relations with the Commonwealth Realms are much more important
The US will want to screw the UK over and destroy the NHS through privatisation

Yes, it's magic fantasy money that everyone pays to the EU and which multiplies after salaries of politicians and their entourage and pointless travels between Brussels and Strasbourg are deducted and every country gets so much more than it paid as a result
...people are still gathering every March for the "Brexit"-Festivities
Records on why and how this custom started where lost in time, but people are really enjoying the ferris wheel and kids are eager to craft yellow papermashe wigs

We could have been gloriously a mix of nuclear and renewables but alas by a tiny margin the country went the wrong way and banned nuclear :(
Austria for the win
And yet we're getting flak by the EU for not "reducing" our carbon footprint fast enough
I can see all the French and demi-French smiling in nuclear (Sweden and Slovakia too)
Fun fact: Austria actually got a nuclear power plant
But it was never used for enetgy production
The goverment allowed to build it, THEN they made a referendum if the people actually want nuclear power, people said no
As far as I know it is now used for training purposes
This makes me weirdly proud and happy
Look at that, Austria is actually leading a positive statistic
Nice
I am not satisfied at all with how things are going
We had a huge head start with hydro and don't produce enough of wind and PV energy
Sehr stolz grad
Yeah, but we don't want to feel bad about ourselves so there is that
Those two don't really cancel each other out
But isnt that a bad excuse
You only need hydro-power etc for peaks (daily and year over) and in order to get a nice average, but for the base load you can use renewables
&#x200B;
The Netherlands have access to the ocean for offshore wind power and they could use biomass too
Also you say that the Netherlands are not connected to Scandinavias grid
Why not
They could use their hydro dams then to help out
What I noticed in the UK as Austrian is that the UK seems to lack in the whole grain bread department
In Austria (and Germany) you can get tons of very good whole grain bread, in the UK there's hardly any, you see some mixed bread, but it's mostly white bread (which doesn't taste that good, except for bagels)
They do, but much less than Austrian shops
Yeah, but with reduced calories you will have to think about nutrition at some point sooner than later
If you eat food with low nutritional value but you eat a lot of it, chances are you will still sort of get enough of what your body needs
But if you eat less and still keep up the same low-nutrition food, you are going to run into trouble at some point
Not that Burgers and Pizza are inherently bad, but there's a huge difference between a Burger stuffed full of veggies on top of the meat, or bacon
American pizza is a calorie bomb with all that fat dripping off and the fat bread
Yeah, I saw after I replied
But that wasn't the implication in your original post and I dare say that was on purpose to make it sound cooler ;)
True, I like Italian pizza most, which isn't that hard to get with the amount of true italian restaurants in Austria
All reddit wants to know is how much likelier you are of being raped in Sweden versus how likely you are to getting shot in The United States

Businesses don't have values
That's not per se bad, you just have to force them to
That's done by levying heavy fines
That's the nature of companies
Their purpose is to make money
*But* since that's not acceptable, we just have to force them to act according to our values, whether they want to or not
But you'll never make a business truly have its own morals

I have never seen the expression 'Polish death camps' used outside of this specific debate about it
Never heard or read anyone claim the concentration camps were built and/or operated by the Polish people
So I am really skeptical about how common this supposed misconception about 'Polish death camps' really is
the term "polish death camps" doesn't really exist in german
but i will do my best to establish it, poland

They do their job as passive reflectors, but they'll never be a substitute for an actual transceiver on the 457kHz rescue frequency
Those are more common amongst possible civilian first responders (or at least I never saw any private person actually carrying a Recco detector around)
That could, if you're lucky, buy yourself time for survival if you find yourself buried
Since the reflectors work differently, having both on you can definitely help, especially if you consider the recco a fallback plan (should you forget to turn to "send", should its electronics fail, should you lose it due to some reason)
But a transceiver is a must
As you said, renting it is a good option

Cities, that still exist
Just wondering, because there might be a misconception in Eastern Austria
I am sure there are more cities, either way
I also think this map is incomplete without adding the names
How did they found cities in Scotland
I thought the Romans never invaded them
Is this just modern cities
Because I know the Romans founded at least Vienna (Vindobona) and the way larger abandoned city of Carnuntum in modern lower Austria

How are share buybacks and dividends the only reason stocks are worth anything
That makes no sense
You can still make money with a share if the company isn't paying out a dividend or buying back its own shares
You do that, by buying a share at a lower price than you sell it
In fact, your "wealth" increases the moment the share increases in value
Buy low, sell high
Right

&#x200B;
Much of the missconceptions about the EU came from UKIP propaganda which was mostly just factually wrong and Nigel Farage apparently was on a russian payroll
Definitely, but UKIP specifically had ads about EU legizlation that was made up
There was an ad about a hotel room with labels on everything, saying stuff like "EU has regulations on pillow size" and "EU has limited the number of threads in the linens" and "EU limits the number of curtains"... etc
and that was a lie
Every country had rules about the quality of cucumbers before that, the EU just unified those rules to be the same for the whole EU, making it easier and more efficient to trade
Also no cucumbers are "prohibited". They are just categorized in Class 1, 2 3
Every country agreed to the ruling and could have prevented the legislation with a single vote in the council back then

This is not the US
> he should be able to express the view while others should be able to comment on that view
Saying historical documents are falisified and thus extinction events have not happend is not a view you can comment on
It's moving the goalposts by taking a view and crossing out all evidence that doesn't support it

History is not as set in stone as you would think it to be

The only defense is to keep the people from trying it
> Would you mind to give an example
If someone claims that historical documents (that have been researched and found to be authentic) are forged, you can not meaningfully comment on that other than to point out that they are not forged
But since the perception of your opposite is already that they **are**, you can certainly comment, but all comments will fall on deaf ears
> Why would we take this chance away by deleting and banning people with certain views
Because the typical genocide denier does not care about discussion
They care about instilling doubt in historical evidence
All they ever do is call into question established facts
How would you discuss chemtrails with someone who believes airplanes are used to disperse psychoactive substances over the broad population
You can't reason with that
The very nature of the fact that you even discuss with them is evidence for them that you are either unwittingly or willingly part of a greater plot against them
**This is the MO
Giving these people room to express their views takes up time, space and resources that could go against something productive as well as actually ligitimizes their concerns about the evidence presented
Nothing about discussing with these people is worthwhile
There is a remedy
Exposure and education
If they have to touch the doors to the gas chambers
If they have to talk to actual victims
But you just can't reason them out of their mania

My parents are from Romania and they always tell me this too
I basically grew up with stories about how negligent and irresponsible people there are
Unfortunately, that made me always see Romania in a negative light and I feel like I'm kind of biased in that sense, which I'm still trying to overcome
But whenever I mention anything interesting/nice I learned about Romania, I always get a string of "yeah but this and this and that and look what they did and wow what a shithole run down country that is" from my parents
I always wonder how much of what they say is true and how much of it is bias, so I find it interesting to see that you seem to have a similar impression as they do
Hope you're never getting sick
Thanks for sharing that
It's funny that you mention that Romanians complain a lot about their country though, because I usually hear the opposite
Both from my own experiences and from what my parents say
I guess most Romanians I've spoken to are also immigrants though, so that would make sense to take pride in one's origins in that case, but the same can't be said for my parents and people they've spoken to
They always told me people are very nationalistic, so I just assumed that to be true

That's not the real channel of the Musikverein though - if you go to channel info you see that it is seated in Singapore, and only has 2 videos uploaded

the country names go in alphabetical order from North to South (works in English and German), and for the capitals, the first one has two weird double consonants like the Estonian language uses, and the other two are in alphabetical order again

Mozart in fact is Austrian
Holy Shit
No he isnt
That policy from the 1999's black-blue 400 IQ government is finally paying of and skiing is dying out

But I wasn´t talking about Mozart, I was talking about Beethoven, who, as you surely know, originally is from Bonn

We had school-done skiing weeks
FPÖVP killed them in an impotent attempt to save a few cents, and long term damage the local tourism with it because teenagers didn't learn skiing anymore through school, which meant they had a chance to learn it if their parents didn't care
Those kids never turned into own country skiing tourists
I was in school at that time and still to this day have friends that can't ski because they never went with school
ah I see
ÖVP strikes again

Absolutely nobody is arguing that Mozart was born in the Archduchy of Austria
I mean, its very nice of you all to explain my Culture and History to me but its getting a bit tiring
Yes, Salzburg was not an Austrian Coreland but always was deeply connected to House Habsburg
Salzburg is now a Part of Austria and an important Part of the Austrian Identity
Also, the Archduchy of Austria is not the modern Nation of Austria its Part of the Austrian Past and Heritage
You did imply it
He was born in Salzburg and had his Center of Life in Vienna
he lived his Life in the Austrian Corelands, that Area that goes on to Form the Nation of Austria
He is very much Part of the Austrian Heritage
Why is it important to you to proof that he isnt Austrian
Which is so weird, because tourism is big business, and this shifted the whole thing more towards foreign skiiers, but now that is drying up and the reckoning is coming, the whole winter tourism industry is completely in the gutter, it's filthy expensive, it's already quickly 1000€+ for a single person for a week, imagine a family of four, nobody wants to work for them anymore, and they're already getting special work allowances to be able to get people from Ukraine or even further east because not even eastern EU wants to subject themselves to these working conditions
It's just a first class clusterfuck 20 years in the making
The Republic of Austria (AKA "Austria") is a successor to both the Archduchy of Austria as well as the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg

How do you think things got better for Ukraine
In what way
They are still fighting corruption and there's no sign of a peaceful reintegration of Donbas
It's not like they tried hard to implement the steps of Minsk II
The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement really valued the people more than economics right
Because that  thing ripped the Ukraine apart

Is that a good thing though

The fact that they are banning people that have been to Crimea is ridiculous

Also it is a bad idea to open packs for anything other than that, the cards you need can be bought way easier on the secondary market (Cardmarket etc

Yeah, you're right, that could happen, altough it's harder to get that repetitive feel if all you buildings are covered in stuck in oppose to the "normal" flat 70ies buildings
Same goes for the modern, flat glassbuildings
I live in Vienna and i don't feel like everything repeats itself
Maybe because most were build from private investors so there was a natural will to differ you building from the other
Interesting topic, but i know too less about it
But people often forget that modern architecture doesn't have to be repetitive
After all, it's mostly free of normes or symetry, so you really could build anything you want and let your creativity roam
But most of the times money has to speak a word
There is simply not that much money for great architecture available, at least from the government - there are all for cheap housing (which is important too)

I'm actually just shocked that Austria is selling any waste to someone else, while we ourselves are buying it from Italy for Energy/Heat production
So you are telling us a few hundred tonnes of imported waste are causing the problems obove
Then it'd need to be dangerous waste, general waste (i.e. what a house produces) we use for production
I know I'll dig hard and deep to find out who does this, and why, and as many specifics as I can find
This is shameful, and only with good data we can create pressure
Sorry, we are currently way too preoccupied by toppling statues

Correct
It's important to remember that turkey does in fact not own northern Cyprus, even if they like to act like they do
TL;DR: Turkey invaded, claiming to protect a Turkish minority, and then just kept their troops there in violation of international law
Historically Cyprus used to be a British colony
However, most people weren't happy about that as they shared lots of culture and language with either the Greeks or the Turks
Under British rule both population groups received individual administration and were, willingly or not, separated
This let to them slowly drifting apart, even though relations had before been pretty close and peaceful
Then, in 1923 the greek-turkish war happend and the relationship between these groups got even worse
Starting in 1930 the Greeks began small revolts against the British who were still holding on to the island, however they were mostly unsuccessful
After the second world war Greece began supporting Greek independence groups on the island and turkey did the same with Turkish groups only shortly after
The British managed to put those two groups against each other and it escalated into a civil war that nearly dragged Greece and Turkey into another war
After lots of negotiation it was decided to release the island into an independent state
Back then Greece, turkey and the UK all agreed to do their best to ensure that Cyprus remained an independent country and was not annexed or integrated by any of the other nations
The new constitution attempted to give both the Turks and Greeks equal rights, f.e. by giving the Turkish minority a veto power
However, nobody was truly happy
The Greeks had wanted to rejoin Greece and the Turkish had wanted to split the island into Greece and Turkey
This let to the two parties constantly vetoing each other and nothing getting done
After bloody riots and small scale skirmishes between militias the UN send peacekeeping forces that more or less separated the island between the Greek and Turkish population
Then in 1974 Greek militia tried to overthrow the government and join Greece
Turkey intervened and landed troops on the island
Nobody wanted a full-blown war, so the rebels decided to hand back control to the previously overthrow government
However, the Turkish government refused to withdraw troops
So today the UN troops station in Cyprus in practice just make sure that the Turkish military doesn't cross into Cyprus in an attempt to somewhat keep the peace on the island
While the south of the island has remained a democracy and has joined the EU the north is de-facto a regime
It has not been recognised internationally and turkey has repeatedly been ordered to leave by the UN

Author explanation of that map:
>Europe has repeatedly been broken down into major regions where physical/geographical and often national and political criteria and considerations have figured prominently including human geography
This will be an attempt to develop a faithful model of cultural spaces excluding national and political intentions while applying factors that (1) leave perceptible effects in the cultural landscape, (2) have a co-determining effect on the attitudes and behaviour of people, (3) are critical factors for today's social, political and economic situations, and (4) provide a spatial breakdown that don't change rapidly
The concept of Central Europe is the point of departure because it has been under discussion for a long period of time and has flared up again on the debate on the end of global and political antagonisms with a particular impact on Europe
Eight criteria will be applied for narrowing down this concept in spatial terms: (1) The historical impact left by German and Jewish culture (as specific characteristics) in addition to Slavic, Romanic and Hungarian layers of culture among other (that are also in evidence outside of Central Europe) (2) The coincidence or temporal succession of Protestantism and Catholicism while orthodoxy and Islam play only a minor role
(3) The early development of an urban system and middle class in comparison to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe as a counterweight to nobility, gentry and church (4) The early existence of a free class of peasants who were not subordinate to a lord of the manor (5) A tradition of local and regional self-administra tion as a result of early political particularism (6) Cultural (i.e., linguistic and religious) diversity including ethnic diversity within states (7) Always tending towards the continent in political and economic terms (not overseas) (8) Late industrialisation in comparison to Western Europe, but early industrialisation in comparison to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe This allows the conclusion that these territories can be subsumed under the term of South-Eastern Europe because they are under Byzantine influence, although the long Ottoman domination has also left sustainable traces
In contrast, Ea stern Europe means the portion of orthodox Europe under Byzantine influence that was only marginally impacted by the Ottoman Empire and hardly transformed by it
Furthermore, Northern Europe is the part of Europe that has remained totally Protestant with a low development density
Western Europe is subsumed under the concept of former colonial powers and territories that are orientated towards the Atlantic and sustainably impacted by the Reformation with an early urban structure and early beginnings of industrialisation
Finally, Southern Europe is the Catholic and essentially Romanic countries with a major seafaring tradition
The regional concepts defined according to these criteria are shown on maps that is supplemented by structuring
(author's abstract)
Always weird to see this kind of map
I usually mix up what I've learned to be the "Ostblock" - basically everything east of the iron curtain - and actual Eastern Europe
If you'd ask me too quick, I'd state with full confidence that the Czech Republic is part of eastern europe

How are you guys doing over there
Do you guys normaly get much snow down there
I would say we are doing fine
Corona could be better and we had some embarrassing (goverment) IT projects lately
Snow is as every year, some parts dont get snow some are drowning in it
Which is impressiv considering our size
Where I live there was like a centimeter snow that was gone after the day and the rest of the days it feels like spring
And other parts of Austria are fighting with the snow
So a year like the last few it feels like, although the contrast is more apparent to me this year
Because of corona or in general
Yes same in Vienna
But it's normally like that
Usually on the second or third wave sticks
I guess its because the ground is still a little too warm
OK fair enough
But I didnt even know that you guys get much snow at all to be honest
I personaly would prefer some more heavy measures to be honest
I feel like out measure are a litle bit to easy going and since today they are even more
I fear a christmas/new year with a big spike incoming
Do be so obessed bro
It's only snow, not covid
Confirmed cases are not infections
Graphs like this are useless without knowing whether testing has increased at the same pace as confirmed cases or not
An explanation of what these figures mean:
>What you see slowing down is the second derivative, i.e. the rate of increase of the rate of increase (for example, day-over-day: +500, +510, + 509, +508 etc
) So the US is still far away from an improvement
It's also not clear whether the figures are accurate, as the US has not been administering as many tests as other countries
What Italy having "turned the tide" here means is that its rate of growth is decreasing (i.e. day-over-day +500, +495, +490 etc
I think this chart should properly show the US somewhere 5 pages above everyone else instead of making the jump from 50 - 100k show in a single line

It's really weird to see that von der Leyen is an actual human being
I'm in
We did our part for sanity: France you're next
Van der Bellen is clearly the better choice
In order to explain, i copy a previous comment of mine:
Hofer (the right wing candidate) is by far the most disgusting person on the political stage
Never before has a campaign been operating with that kind of maliciousness, that Hofer and his supporters have shown
They had less arguments for themselfes than rumors about their opponent
At first, they started spreading rumors about VdB suffering from Chancer and Dementia
In the later phase of the campaign, they started calling VdB a nazi, a communist, a spy of the eastern block (while always claiming that Hofer had better relations to Russia) and a neoliberal
This right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out
In an earlier debate, he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in Jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of Israel
The TV station found out, that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack Hofer claimed to have witnessed
He and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate
It later became known that while Hofer was at the temple mountain, someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police, but this was not identical to Hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns
He was not near that, but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack
A few weeks ago, he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses
When beeing called out for that, he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim
Telling lies with a straight face is what Hofers campaign is based on
Hofer tried to make himself look sympathetic, but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling "lies" when VdB started citing him
There is a real danger that should he get into office, he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view
If he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate, he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness, taking Austria as a hostage with him
The really dangerous thing about Hofer is, that he is working against the EU membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to Russia and Serbia
Both of these countries are economically unimportant to Austria
Hofer would cause economical damage by trying to severe relations to countries that are the most important to us while bowing down before a country that offers no perspective for us except how things looked 50 years ago
After Brexit and Trump, it's nice to see even a small victory over populism
And I'm very glad this country has at least some common sense left
In theory it's still open, this is just the first projection at about 60% of votes counted, without postal ballots
However it is very unlikely that anything is still going to change
Last time around the first projection showed Hofer ahead and VdB still came out the winner in the end
The current results are mainly from rural areas
Urban areas tend to be more left
hooray
today im glad to be austrian :D

Ehhh
It's not so much about overall turnout but about voter mobilisation
And it looks like Van der Bellen was better at this
[People were prepared]
FPÖ said that they won't contest the election, so the glue's OK
Austrian solutions to Austrian problems :>
Especially because he is usually doing better with postal votes
And this result is without them
It doesn't count if you only do it once, it's a best of 3
He did win with a much greater lead this time around though, so that's reassuring :)
You are welcome
I think many people were pissed off that they had to vote for a 3rd time becasue the FPÖ appealed it
This is my personal theory on this
I think it shows that people are trying to maybe get more involved in political process since they can grasp that real change (represented by the FPÖ) can happen
This motivates their own voters as well as everyone who wants to prevent it
Thanks for getting occupied and taking one for the team

Nein

Just reducing it to immigration is a little simplistic I think; also van der Bellen is not really pro-immigration while Hofer is definitely anti
Hofer: Right-wing, presents himself as anti-establishment, plans an active presidency (and unconventionally so), talks about change in broad bold strokes, definitely anti-immigration
Made inquiries about chemtrails in parliament
van der Bellen: Left-wing, environmentalist, plans a more traditional moderate presidency, wants reform but with level-headedness and calm discussion
Says he wants to be a president of all Austrians
Might motivate both sides more to take part in elections (increasing voter turnout) - the ones that are pro-populist right wingers to "prevent another disaster" and the progressive ones (or anti-populist right wingers) "since there still is hope out there".
My hope is that this leads to a better climate in total, with right wingers realizing that just making outlandish claims and spweing hate is not enough to win elections without some actual program behind (Hofer was actually quite good in this regard most of the time) and the rest of the bunch being a bit more motivated and actually approaching their base again a bit more openly
Nothing will change
Even if the eurosceptics would win in some nations
There is no Eu exit movement besides the one in the UK
And other than in the UK most nations require a super majority in both referendums and the parliament to leave the EU
This is impossible for eurosceptic parties to achieve as for example our moderate parties and the dutch moderate parties refuse to go into a coalition with their respective far right
We'll carry on
I wouldnt say that, thats way to generalized
Basically, to become president of Austria you have to get 50% + 1 vote
In the first round there were 6 candidates:
* Alexander Van der Bellen, former leader of the Green Party, running as an independent
* Norbert Hofer, from the right wing FPÖ
* Irmgard Griss, former judge, running as an independent
* Rudolf Hundstorfer, from the social democratic SPÖ
* Andreas Khol, from the conservatice ÖVP
* Richard Lugner, TV-personality and millionaire who was running as independent
Because none of them had more than 50% there was a second round with the winner and the second place of the first election
This was then ruled as not valid and had to be held again and then also the date was changed because the postal votes were flawed
This means, that a lot of conservative voters or voters from the social-democratic party voted for either candidate because there was no candidate of their own party
Austrian parliament is at the moment split between 6 parties with 3 major ones (SPO, OVP, FPO) and 3 smaller ones (Grüne, Team Stronach, Neos)
I think if was less amazing then people thing VDB was well liked across the left spectrum and also within large parts of the liberal conservative voters
He was the best candidate for a extremely polarizing election
And I doubt that the Green Party would find a similar candidate soon again
If you look at it like that it was an extreme feat but not unexpected
We have a whopping 6 parties in our parliament now
Especially if you consider that we're only 7 million people
It's one of the few feats I think is genuinelly good about us
...by a margin of 6%, no less
*sigh*
Austria has never really been in favour of Turkey joining the EU
Polls in 2006 showed, that as much as 81% of Austrians disagreed with Turkey joining the EU
That figure is probably even higher today
Obviously, after Erdogan imprisoned critical journalists and said that he was thinking about reinstating the death penalty there was no way that Austria would suddenly support Turkey joining the EU
What shall he do
? He has almost 0 executive power
Learn about our political system before you say something - please
There are only the mail votes to count tomorrow and they won't be able to change the result
Hofer already admitted defeat
For a change, we do the Anschluss the other way around now ;)
THey did say that last time though
No, this result includes a projection of postal votes
In real numbers he's about 100
000 votes ahead at the urns
9 million votes for Hofer vs 2
0 million for VdB
Are your coalition parties capable of working together
Because here in Austria they are essentially like a disfunctional marriage and one of the two (ÖVP) has been eyeing the FPÖ as their new boytoy for the past year or so
(They also had 7 years of coalition from 2000-2007
Hofer is far-right, but not a Neo-nazi
3rd
Did I miss one election
Kickl is even worse TBH
Repeating an election because of faulty envelopes is not enough
That was some overplayed media bullshit
Sure he can
he could even give his party an order to form a gov
And then what
The power in the national council remains unchanged, leading to the most impotent gov in the 2nd republic
Next election the FPÖ might even vanish under the limit nessecary to get into the parliament
The only votes in there would be constant votes of non confidence against the new FPÖ govs members
And if hed also dissolve the council
Then a new general election would be held, and imagine how THAT would turn out for the FPÖ if they pull that shit
No real fringe views, he's a very moderate left
Then what do you call a party that uses election posters with solgans like "Daham statt Islam" which translates to "(At) home instead of Islam"
or "Heimatliebe ansatt Marokkaner-diebe" - "Love for your country insted of maroccan thiefs"
A party with tens of covicted politicians - a lot of them because of sedition or "Wiederbetätigung" which stands for "re-engagement in national socialist activities" - alone in the last 5 years
What do you call them if not racists and bigots
Every since "polarisation" has become a thing
My side: Everything good on this lovely green earth
The other side: Everything bad in this fucked up world
Between: Doesn't exist
Open discussion of ideas: Go fuck yourself you [opposite side label here] bigot
I have never met a left-wing racist
Not all right-wing people are racists, but all racists are right-wing
In Austria, it is
Do you even know how you get the austrian citizenship
It's a German one
Their name literally means "South-German Newspaper".
This 2bh
Austrians just don't like frivolous elections
Any party that provokes reelections gets soundly blown out on the day of decision
To be honest, I don't think many people care about Trump
Brexit was imho the bigger factor
No, it did not
They just had a different result which included the projection of postal votes
One guy said that in 1991 in a heated debate
A guy that's dead for over a decade
Deshalb rennt er mit ner Kornblume herum :\^)
Na, aber in meiner Denke is die 2 ausgefallen, und nicht einfach verschoben worden
I voted 4 times, because postal vote
I was about the send out my ballot for October 4th when they postponed it
> Kickl is even worse TBH
Kickl studies philosophy since 50 semesters and just doesn't get smarter
But he's the playwright, not on the stage (mostly)
And what a poet he is
BIERZELT STATT SHAKESPEARE
Idiocy knows no borders, also there is a difference between sharing values and exercising them
What's globalist about it anyways
thanks for also caring :)
As you can see, I posted this 6 hours ago when the national broadcaster said that 1% more people turned out to vote this time round
I'm sorry for not having accurate data right after the polls were closed
If they didn't fly to Austia to vote in person, their vote isn't even counted yet - postal ballots must stay closed and uncounted until tomorrow
Because zero tolerance policies are not popular or realistic at all
Right now the FPÖ seems to be more nebulously claiming that there are "too many" (without giving any indication how many would be fine) and that they are "dangerous" (again: no actual measurables given)
Hofer wanted to be seen as more likeable, taking a harsh stance wouldn't have helped him
6 yrs
no, half of the country are not environmentalist
but then again there are also nazis who recycle ;)
I know
Look at the image
It clearly says "Hochrechnung inklusive Wahlkarten-Prognose".
In theory, everything
Full control over military (hah, funny, as if we had one) and the government
However, the president is expected to never use those powers except for emergency situations
In practice, the position is just for representation and a advisor/mediator for the day to day government
However, Hofer has announced he'd use those powers
And he certainly could have helped his party in the next elections
Aja stimmt, hab ich voll verdrängt
However, the ORF included the postal votes in their projection
We have a larger spectrum, our conservative, center right wing party is the ÖVP which I guess is more in line with your believes
The FPÖ (party of Hofer) has focused on one subject the last couple of decades and that's problems with foreigners and immigration
A lot of their members have ties to far right organisations, for example one organisation Hofer is or was part of doesn't recognize Austria as a country and sees it as part of Germany
Aside from that they may hold some solid conservative views, but it is behind a very questionable shield, which is very very hard to overlook
It also doesn't help that we still have to deal with shit from the time they were part of the administration in the early 2000s.
It's not just a guy it's a party, but what would you call Le Pen for example
Yes maybe not all right wing politicians are like this, but in the last years we see a rise of these politicians and their supporters
No, not here
Let me introduce to the accepting world of *[Burschenschaften
>A frequent accusation is that Burschenschaften have an elite social understanding
In various publications, during events and demonstrations, the traditions of the Burschenschaften and other groups are often put into a right-wing context by their opponents
In particular, the Burschenschaften of the Burschenschaftlichen Gemeinschaft are politically often at the right edge of the student connections
Basically, a collective of elite students, often sons of lawyers and entrepreneurs, who get together and exchange mostly right-wing, nationalist ideas
It's a little hard to explain
What's not hard to explain is that every politician from the party Andreas Hofer is in is either a current or former member of a Burschenschaft
Hofer is in one of those groups and proud of it
Sounds like he'd make a good, neutral president, right
Since it's South-German it is very close to Austria and reports on us more frequently than others as far as I am aware and it is also widely respected (iirc it was the newspaper that was initially approached with the data from the Panama leak)
I'm stupid, sry
If you would get called a Nazi all the time you would just out of spite just as everybody would
After being called a Nazi over and over again Haider said "well at least he had some proper economic policies (unlike the current government at the time)". It's a quip
Kanns dir nicht verdenken \^^
I am not surprised about that and I am also not satisfied with the slow and insufficient reaction from our politicians regarding the refugee crysis
That doesn't change the fact, that a lot of the right wing parties have no agenda except - let's leave the eu and close the borders and even for this one point they have no plan
Brexit showed us how that works out
So why shouldn't we be allowed to call ultra nationalists racist
See you also think you are clever by quipping but you're falling into the same trap he did
That's exactly what I'm talking about
It hasn't happened because the pro Brexit side doesn't have a plan
It's the same with our right wing party
A lot of talk but no actual plan and that is different from caring about your country, because caring would mean to have at least a rough idea about every political matter instead of some slogans regarding foreigners
That's not what I said but nothing you have said sofar would lead me to belive that you are a guy for nuances anyway
Well than we have something we can agree on, I am also pro Brexit because I think it's better for the EU

so many different groups, all finding together and being so unhappy all at once
I wonder how much of that is directly related to what people read on social media – and I wonder how much *that* is related to Russian propaganda activities
not saying that there's nothing to complain about, and not saying that the French wouldn't also protest on their own
but so many issues coming together in such a massive outbreak, feels like somebody has been pouring gasoline on the little flames to turn it into a huge firestorm

How is Sinterklaas racist

My country is spot on though
As Austrian, I can agree that being called german is often fairly annoying
And after that, the obvious confusion with Australia
The Austrian one doesn't do much for me
Personally i find the Austria-Australia thing much more annoying, though mostly because it's such an over-used joke
Can confirm this as an austrian
Hmm maybe I'm a Finn then

Finally a time to plug my subreddit /r/flagsinreallife
Used to work as a receptionist at a hotel
Something that needs the be said especially about people from France is: They speak english pretty well but only once the tried to speak french to you for like 10 minutes, not believing that neither you nor any of you colleagues (which was usually 2
) speaks french
Like, literally, they stood there talking to me with words that I had no idea what they meant
After 5-10 minutes they SUDDENLY remember how to speak english
Sorry by the way that I just plainly said "people from France" I know its just a minority but stating that in the sentence above would have overdone it
As a little "repayment" I also think that people from France where among the most friendly, topped only by Japanese and Swiss
This kind of speaking is giving me a circleruntogetherbreak
Hahaha
Hallstatt, Austria: what was going on in the past 100 years
Nothing much apparently
it looks more depressing now tbh (still pretty tho)
Am Upper Austrian and went there at the end of april again after many many years of avoiding it because of the tourists
This was before the restaurants reopened and the place was pretty much empty
Really weird
I think I was able to take some pictures from the town which, under normal circumstances, are impossible to take (empty main street, empty town square)
Still was a weird feeling though but nevertheless beautiful
more like 1 m; the Eurasian Plate moves 1 cm per year

While there are a lot of people thinking the same and visit because they think its currently not as crowded, even if you hit the worst peak there probably are less people there than any day the last few years
Yes but they managed to mirror the whole image because they used a picture as a reference
They needed some tome to grow
I think its a colorized black and white picture

Of course, the Netherland has already the solution to the rising sea level
This is a dumb idea TBH, it would cause many problems
Just build artificial islands from sand/stone taken from the oceans - solves the rising sea levels and potentially other problems of overpopulated areas
OK so assuming this would actually be built
Would that do anything
Or would it be rather pointless

True but you can’t measure global significance of some event by its presence on Twitter
Because there were significantly more people (illegally) demonstrating against the covid-lockdown in a 2mio city (Vienna, or basically every major city in Europe) than there were demonstrating for Navalny in a 12 mio city
He just is not that popular in Russia and if not hyped by the western media he would be totally insignificant today
That's unpopular here and i again expect a lot of downvotes, but it's true
[At least it's not hordes of starving monkeys
In my two local supermarkets here in Vienna they restocked most stuff very quickly after the weekend and I think it helped a lot reduce any panic buying before the WE

It is by far the best option, though
People need to stop expecting these kinds of things to be absolutely perfect
Oh Comrade Corbyn
The problem is actually not the fact that they want to be no EU member
The problem is _leaving_ the EU
It'd be comparable with Texas wanting to secede from the USA, the legal, regulatory and economic systems have become so intertwined that leaving is a big mess of trying to recreate all that legislature
**But wait
** We haven't even gotten to this
The UK is now arguing, how deeply integrated into the EU they want to be
There is Norway which is deeply integrated but not an official member, then there is Switzerland which is less but still heavily part of some institutions
And then there is basically Brazil with no ties at all
This is what the UK is arguing about
Also, there is a whole border conflict with Ireland, because Northern Ireland (part of the UK) only remained peaceful, because there was no border between it and "real" Ireland because of the EU
This would now create a border again, which around 50% of Northern Irelanders are going to be _really_ mad about
It's not just random people on the internet jumping on the "paid by Soros" thing - it's actual politicians as well
This kind of deliberate lying can't be just ignored

Do they wait for 5:45 h before shooting back
Austrian here - short update 10:40
- 5 dead people so far -  one terrorist, four pedestrian now (09:25)
- ~12 injured (all gunshot wounds), 7 of them in a pretty critical state
- the dead terrorist was 20 years old, born in north macedonia and did have the austrian and macedonia citizenship
Back in April 2019 he was arrested because he did try to join IS
He was released on 5th December
(10:40)
- the dead terrorist did wear an explosiv belt, bomb squad had to come and take care of the body
He did have a rifle, a pistol, a machete and lots of ammunition
~~Atm (02:10) they analyse if the explosive belt was real or just a fake~~ 07:10 it turned out the explosive belt was a "fake" and would not have worked
- the dead terrorist has been identified, ~15 house searchings happend 2 or 3h ago, few more people arrested during this house searchings
(09:25)
- police and special forces are searching the city atm and arrested 4 more (but atm its not confirmed if they are involved or not)
- Jagdkommando (military special forces) taking over the protection of special buildings (like embassys) from police, so police can focus on the search for other terrorists
- its still not confirmed if the nearby Synagogue was the target or not
The whole area does have a lot of bars, theaters and other stuff and this evening / night was the last one before the new Covid Lockdown starts today
Interior Minister is just being interviewed and he confirmed it is a terror attack with multiple attackers and multiple people dead already
Operation is still ongoing and all the special forces are being activated
The Austrian Jagdkommando has been deployed in Vienna, followed by "good hunt
" messages in newspaper forums
" If you have footage of any kind of the shooting incident in the inner city of Vienna – please upload it on this link – DON’T share it on social media
This way you can support us
[ [#0211w] "
God damn that shit hits different when you see those videos of places you’ve been hundreds of times
A second civilian has apparently died
A woman succumbed to her injuries
I missed one of the attacks by a few minutes, it was right on the usual path from my garage to my apartment
Police closed the bridge to the 1st district as I was going in that direction
I waited 5:30 hours to get home (with police escort
) and have to say: they're very well organized, extremely friendly and helpful
It feels very safe despite the situation since they're well-equipped and secured every sector of the area
The current government however, is a bunch of incompetent losers
One Thing that has really become apparent is how different our news sources are
On one hand you got our state news "ORF" wich Reports on facts and confirmed statements
And on the other you got the shitshow "Ö24" wich plays all the videos that are being posted against explizit Orders from police on loop, even the graphic ones, uncensored
At least one police officer was confirmed dead, currenty 15 people in hospital, 7 of them severely injured
Source: Vienna hospital official statement and reports from our most important TV channel
Edit: the police officer was hopefully wrongly confirmed
Latest reports say one dead attacker, on dead civilist
Vianna hospitals report "several dead and severly injured"
Edit 2: reports still only confirm only 2 dead (1 attacker, 1 civilian)
Chancellor Kurz just confirmed that the police officer is not dead but severely injured

Person living in Vienna here
My acquaintance (he is under the age of 16) saw the death of an individual
He was shot twice
It is a clip on the news
He caught the second shot but not the first
Totally traumatized
Major of vienna just confirmed one dead civilist
Press still says "only" one dead
It's almost a miracle that these stupid ass terrorists are too dumb or else that would have been a massacre
Every person injured or dead is one too much, just to be clearl
The first terror attack we in Vienna experienced for 40 years
I hope nothing else happens, thank god rumours about hostages and a detonation were fake
Radicals are a cancer in our society
It is still not certain it was an attack in the sinagogue
Stay home
Stay safe
Seems like he/they attacked a Synagogue
Interestingly enough, Synagogues have 24 h police protection in Austria
"organized well" = basically they got good guns and a few people who managed to fly under the radar of the police
It doesn't take much to do these kinds of attacks
Sadly true, Vienna's mayor just confirmed it on national TV
I dont think people are that bad at planning
Last updated speak of 7 deceased, there are multiple videos online
A shame, used to rely and pride itself with neutrality :(
6 shootings, we don't know yet if those happend at the same time by 6 or more attackers or one after another
and we don't know what weapons they have, we only know that the attacker shot by the police carried explosives
And the live-ticker the newspaper Der Standard: [
Only speculation right now, also they are posting videos despite the explicit plead by the police not to
Still unclear
They said 6 locations
1 killed, 4 maybe arrested and 1 on the run
Would make sense, but could be only 2 attackers as well
It were probably humans
This won't end until we stop letting them in and deport every single asshole that shows even the slightest sympathy for attacks like this
I hope they keep lists of those cheering on social media, whatsapp and so on
Enough is enough
this is not local news but the boulevard showing stuff the police has asked not to show
stopp posting stuff like OE24
Absolutely agree
Funnily enough I know the founder of OE24
He seems like a nice man
But his news channel is trash
Judging from the footage it didn't look good for him but it hasn't been disclosed who the victims are
Won't ever happen here
Too many people against this
Atleast one attacker is confirmed dead
One perpetrator is supposed to be dead, one arrested
Might be the same person, everything is pretty much in limbo right now
police only confirmed "long guns" until now without any more details
It's not
Might be flash-add-"walled" but you can just click that away - or use an addblocker
The change since 2015 is tangible, people are slowly waking up
Me neither, Vienna is supposed to be one of the safest cities in Europe, this was the first terror attack we had in over 40 years
Let's hope it stays that way and that the last attackers get caught
I have faith in our anti-terror-unit
Vienna is still one of the safest citys
if you are better to judge those things or have more information than the police, you might should tell them (the austrian police asked to not upload videos here to help them [
otherwise those are just rumours what people might have seen or heard and not knows facts

Good riddance
A friend of mine recently came back from being in the States for 5 months and basically what he told me is that going to church is something which he enjoyed much more there than here in Austria
There he learned a lot, it was fun and he always looked forward to meeting people there
Here it's something boring, you don't learn a lot of stuff which you wouldn't learn in religion in school and it's something old people do
Here the church is something old and many even hate it
Disclaimer: I can't accurately say how the church is here out of first hand, only from what I've heard from many others
> Why does it seem like many in this sub will attack anyone for being religious like its a terrible thing
I see very little personal attacks against religious people on this sub
Attacking someone's religion isn't equivalent to attacking someone's persona
If you equate the two then you're wearing into dangerous territory of shielding religion from critisism and outside opinion
> I know plenty of very nice, intelligent, non-delusional religious people here in the States (yea, I know, it kinda sucks)
That being said I also know many nut-jobs from both deeply religious and atheist backgrounds
Now you're complaining about people's hatred for religion itself
What is it you don't understand
Dislike for religion or dislike for believers
And yes
Obviously a nut-job is a nut-job no matter whether he's religious or not
That's not exactly something people are denying
> Why can't atheist just let the Christians be and vice-versa
That's what everyone is doing
Voicing your distain for somebody's belief itself doesn't impede their ability to stay religious
Nobody here's physically forcing people to lay down their belief
> Why does one have to dance on other people's faith for being fairy tale and the other lambaste someone for not believing in their God
Criticizing faith is allowed
It's what we call free speech
And in this particular case it's more than understandable
Would you take issue with someone dancing over Greek Gods and their Mythology and calling them fairy tales
> Particularly why does this sub think that a complete lack of belief is the best thing ever and many (not all) commentators shame religion
Why do religious people think they're right
Why do atheists think they are
The answer to both questions is obvious
Both groups think of themselves as the moral high-ground
Nothing annoys me more than people getting into heated discussions about pizza toppings
Pizza is Pizza, I welcome it in any form that it may come, and if you don't, you are a whiny nuisance
If you don't like the topping on your pizza remove it, but please dear god, shut the fuck up about it

Funfact: If you look at the border between Belgium and Germany you can see the lines to some wierd overlap thing
This is called the Rennbahn or something like that
Its a strip of belgian land about the size of a small street that "cuts" through the german land
Yes, if you run you can go from germany to belgium and back to germany within seconds
Basically, after war when terretory was being declared, belgium insisted that a specific railway that both starts and ends in belgium, but passes german land, has to stay completely belgian
Which germany agreed to
At some point the railway got obsolete and was replaced by a cycling path, but the land remained belgium
There is even a place where only a single house is german and everything surrounding it is belgian
what a twat
plus they got Irn-bru, what's not to love
I applied to a Scottish uni two years ago and they said I was only considered an European if I had lived the last three years in Europe (I hadn’t), which is so fucking fucked up
"Damn Scots, they ruined Scotland
"Scotland cannot discriminate against citizens of other eu countries
" English are not citizens of "other EU country". Basically, denmark could say: All EU citizens except Danish citizens can got to uni for free". Of course nobody does that
And people wonder why the right is having a resurgence
Can only hope something will happen to deal with this problem
Oh yeah, this thread will go great
Edit: Which was to be proven
At this point it's pretty much safe to assume that the ones who don't support this shit are the outliers
No such thing as a "moderate" in that death cult
Maybe that will happen I don't know can't look into the future
But people feel helpless and they fell enraged when they read about a teacher getting **beheaded** because he showed a picture and when people feel threatened with no help in sight then they will turn to extremes good or bad be damned

I think German astronaut Alexander Gerst jamming with Kraftwerk was pretty cool
Do they plan to cook meth in space or what
If ESA put together a manned mission to the moon, Mars or even an asteroid that could happen, but as cool as the Rosetta mission was, that's the only major ESA mission I even heard of
I know China also has a space program because it's featured in The Martian movie/book
According to a German EMT, 112 works in the USA and 911 works in the EU
Just in case visitors need to call for  help
This worked for me in Spain - I called 911 in the hopes of getting someone new  who spoke English, as I do not speak Spanish
I got a Spanish speaking operator and a translator on the line, which wasn’t bad
911 also works almost everywhere
doesn't sound so backwards to me; calling to have a fire put out (and being asked for relevant details) is something very different than reporting a heart attack (and being given first responder medical support)
but maybe I'm just saying that because I'm so used to also havinv three numbers (among a few others nobody knows about or remembers during an emergency)
would one single number actually be easier
but they would still have to put you through to the relevant emergency service, no
I had no idea lol just the other day I wondered how fucked I'd be in an emergency bc I've been watching too much US TV and my mind immediately goes to 911 while my brain is also eternally confused which number is for which emergency service in Austria
(if I had to dial quickly I mean)

Good guy Dublin Airport selling bottled water after checking-in for just 1 €. Shame yourselves all other airports ripping off thirsty travellers
And by not having to pay an employee they probably still make money on this, even though some people might just take water without paying for it
But in all honesty, I wish more airports would adopt something like this
Why don't you drink tapwater in Europe
It's perfectly clean in practically all the places
I highly disagree
Shame on all airports that don't provide free tap water (or filtered, if tap water isn't drinkable there) behind security
Thanks
Definitely
I doubt that they have to pay much more than 10-20 Cent per bottle when they buy them
1 pay roughly 10c/m³
Yeah
Quite a nice markup
Servas
Probably more expensive
Upkeep, more complex restocking, buying the vending machine, etc
But you don't need a technician to do it

Here at the Bavarian/Austrian border it seems as if we have gotten off rather good
It's been way less bad than the last few years, at least that's how I felt it (Barely ever got >30° C)

"Today"? How would you even be able to reliably determine the date when a settlement this old was officially founded
That's what I'm saying, so the settlement is likely older than that
I have a really hard time seeing the actual mouth as the mouth and not the upper lip making a sort of oooo mouth
Huh, now that I'm thinking about it like that it's really kind of weird, in a gross way
Nope, not the nose
See the upper lip
It has a dip in it, sort of like a half-circle curving inwards
That looks like a mouth to me (with a really derpy expression), with the gaping *real* mouth being the neck
Funny austria isn't there, seeing as Conchita once won
No we Are not on the shortlist yet
And I doubt we will manage, too many friends of Putin here
Maybe he really sucks at that ?
In a more serious note - he has no real power afaik ? And the parties in power are apparently not so eager
Guess it because we're neutral

So 5 years and a few months in Austria
Our politicians always wait until Germany does something and then copy it
Because the state values the stabilizing effects people in long-term relationships have on society as a whole
Marriage is a show of commitment to such long-term relationships, and as such the state chooses to reward it
Coming from another single man btw
I would've suspected Austria to be way more sceptical of their children dating a muslim
Not ok, just a lot more understandable given current tensions

I already voted nobody in who is for this bullshit, what else can I do but not vote for these madmen
Shouldn't there be a purchase/price icon beside the links as well
Same
Basically, it's just wasting a vote
Yeah I can only vote for the greens, and they are so out of touch with reality they aren't even in our national parliament anymore, but at least they are so far removed from reality that I can vote for them there, as someone who loves in reality has to actually implement their ideas from there
And the big parties either voted for it, or didn't vote at all (which is just as bad as voting for it)

Let's see where this is going
Personally, I don't really know what to think of the green surge in countries around Europe but let's see what they are made of
Pray for Germany
Damn, Liechtenstein
The most murderous country in western europe
as a Slovak who works in Austria who likes to travel, euro makes my life significantly easier :) have you ever been in Prague
i have a feeling everyone wants to scam you there
even freaking ATMs scam you
90% of these scams would be gone if they had euro
Its funny how countries who are benefiting so much from their EU membership hate on the union so much
It gives individual states more options regarding ~~fiscal~~ monetary ~~politics~~ policy by manipulating the value of the currency
also there is no such thing as a non-bank atm in slovakia
i've never seen one, maybe there are some in bratislava
if you come from slovakia you have no reason not to trust an atm
you don't need to say that to me
i think i'm smart enough not to get scammed ;)
well that may be easy in your country
since we have euro the exchange offices are practically non-existent in slovakia
and banks take too long to get you the money and it's just too complicated
it's easier to come to the country and get the money there when needed
many people also don't feel comfortable walking around with big amounts of cash if you go abroad for longer periods of time
so no
it's easier to just come to an ATM and take out smaller amounts
also as i mentioned since non-bank ATMs in slovakia don't exist you have no reason to not trust an ATM
This is real summer weather
You're just not used to it anymore after all those extremely hot years

He was actually not wrong
Don’t forget Africa, yugoslavia, greece and so on
Yes minor fronts, but in the end these, the Atlantic wall, and so on bound forces
The assessment that Germany can’t wage a war on multiple fronts by the soviet generals was imho not wrong

Fuck I thought that was modern day Cersei Lannister
Kant lived in the 18th century so any implication of racism in the modern sense is ridiculous
He could only ever see the world as it was to him and of course today the circumstances would be vastly different and he would accept other ethnicities as being acceptable and necessary
„Handle so, daß die Maxime deines Willens jederzeit zugleich als Prinzip einer allgemeinen Gesetzgebung gelten könne
“ implores the listener to to act in a way that could be the basis foundation of a universal legislation
As multiethnicity is a basic reality and a basic necessity of modern societies, acceptance of other ethnicities is needed for a modern society to funtion
Thus Kant already tells us how he would act
Good thing you mentioned the soruce

Its what happens when you have broad stroke laws without much thought for detail
Plus laws that make sure the production lines never stop, and the market is never oversaturated
Thats 6 buckets of Sauerkraut right there

That stuff holds months, if not over a year if you store it right
But it needs to get off the shelves, otherwise you would have to lower the price with the storages filling up with kraut

I was bored during the lockdown and created a "how to divide Austria" map
As an Austrian, absolutely everything about these maps is accurate
Explanation:
Territory: [South Tyrol]
West/East: Eastern Austria is influenced by Balkan-countries
Unfortunately this is not only being used as a compliment
In the eastern part of Austria the economy is weaker than in the west and the mentality is also more relaxed
There is a saying that the Balkan always starts 20km east from where you live
Famous exports:
[Ski lifts]
[Covid-19]
Red Bull
Josef Fritzl
[Antifreeze Wine]
Dialects: I'm sure a lot of my fellow Austrians will complain about this map
It's really simplified as often every valley and village has its own dialect
Krkrk: Tyrolleans pronounce words like Innsbruck or lecker with a "kr". Innsbruckrr, leckrrr, etc
Diminutive:
"Inselen, Schallalen, Gabalen". (Some) Carinthians like to make words cuter
It's like saying doggie instead of dog or ringlet instead of ring
Prolonging the words: "Heaaaast oidaaa, hosd a boa schülling fia de haaaazung"
In the east they like to prolong the pronunciation
As an upper-austrian living in Vienna I can absolutely confirm the language parts of upper austria and Vienna
Immerhin wissens endlich wos a Mohnflessal is
Btw, Austrian tongue-twister even difficult for natives:.
"Er hot s'Bsteck zspät bstöt"
(He ordered the cutlery too late)
The West/East comparison is totally not accurate but the rest certainly is
Vienna “ Wannabe Standard German” there is no way you can count yourself as Austrian after that
Beim ersten Bild hast Bayern vergessen sonst schöne Arbeit
Gotta say, this is pretty accurate
Except for maybe the "politics" part
I grew up in eastern Styria and it's very much ÖVP country, not red
Thanks a lot :)
Haha yes I know them
The saying in Tyrol is that everything east of Tyrol is the Balkan
Short explanation: Jörg Haider with his FPÖ-party was one (if not the first) modern right-wing populist in Europe/the world
Salzburg is attracting mostly Americans and Asians
They often expect and like that stuff unfortunately
Oh and it's easier to rip tourists off with those things haha
Depends on the Viennese you speak
The "original" dialect is really sweet
People who speak Schönbrunner Deutsch make me want to swim face down in the Danube
> viennese is hands down the nicest german dialect
Disagreed but apparently i bark (though graz isn't quite as barky as the rest)
May I introduce you to A[ustrian Standard German]
It's shocking how many people - even austrias - aren't aware of the fact that there is an official, well definded correct way of österreichisches Hochdeutsch - just as official as the german standard german they speak in Germany
Nowadays most people in Vienna don't speak Viennese anymore, instead they use a more standard German with remnants of the dialect here and there, the extent of which may vary for different districts and social classes
Its more about new viennese which is very piefkenesisch
Thank you :)
Your words mean more to me anyway ️
As someone living in said area, I would like to apologize
A few minutes earlier somebody criticized me for using Lwiw :(
Been there, done that
Didn't work out
The Balkan always starts 20 km east of where you live ;D
Sorry :(
A lot actually
Here is one:
I love your enthusiasm about Austrian men
Scchwarzenegger is from the region where it says "barking dogs" on the dialect-map
Only people in this area talk similar to him
I would say everybody in Austria understands this Styrian dialect
Jaaa das war ja uuuur leiwand
[Watch this video] and tell me again that this is not a "wanna-be High German"
It's more comparable to how you pronounce "ayyy" in English
At least that was not intentionally haha
Always true
Except on those days when wine>beer
it's just that we in the east see people in the mountain regions as mountain hillibillies
Gut, dass du fragst
Ja, ihr seid wirklich wo angrennt ;D
Ernsthaft: Da gings mit um diesen Neu-Wiener Dialekt
Den sprechen leider immer mehr und der klassische Wiener Dialekt geht verloren
just listen to schwarzenegger german interview in the 80s
It's comparable to the sound of an "ay" in English or an "ou" in German
A good example would be this [video between 10 seconds and 12 seconds]
The state of Upper Austria
So the one with Hitler and Hallstatt
Before the town of fucking got renamed I originally had the village in the Tourism-map
As Fucking(now Fugging) and Hallstatt (the small red dot below "All of Asis") are only villages I didn't know how to do it better than just write cities under quotation marks
Basically [free market capitalism]
Lord have mercy
Exactly
Instead of Insel they (sometimes/often) use Inselen
Similar to doggie instead of dog or ringlet instead of ring
1) It's beautiful so please stay
2) Culturalle they are still close to the rest of Austria (although ther are differences of course)
3) Please don't

The funny thing is:
I originally had Fucking in the Tourism-map
[Here's what it looked like (it's the one where it say Brits and Americans]
As they renamed it removed it from the map :(
Es gab bis vor Kurzem ein Dorf in Österreich mit dem Namen "Fucking". Es war ein beliebtes Ziel bei englischsprachigen Leuten
Im Dezember habens das aber in Fugging umbenannt
Als ich diese Karte erstellt hab, hieß es noch Fucking und war im "Tourism" Teil eingezeichnet
Da es nur ein Dorf war, hab ich Cities unter Anführungsstriche gesetzt
Jetzt vorm Posten hab ichs aber noch entfernt, das "Cities" lies ich aber so stehen
Of course ️
Haha it's okay :)
It was crossposted to r/mapporn I think, maybe that's where you saw it
99% of us are
It's just harmless teasing
ok my bad
Pretty sad that you don’t learn your own history apparently since Italian irrendentism claimed Corsica, Nice, Savoy, Istria, Dalmatia, Malta and so on
All of this lead to the reintegration in WW2
It's been pretty much the most beautiful, magical part of the country, simply cut out of it
I mean, what do you expect
But with the EU it's all history anyway, or at least should be
"Austria" and "Italy" should be a thing for the past
Was ??? Ja peinlich ka wir reden alle scho so im classic Wienerisch aber ja Großstadt hat halt immer weniger Dialekt :/ eh schod .
Ah yeah, the "Heurigen" of the Danube region are a thing of beauty
Glad you liked it
Glad you made it to a good Heurigen - nowadays there are those tourist-traps-"Heurigen" as well, with overprized mediocer food and kitschy music
Ja echt extrem schade:(
I will piss on your beaches next holiday for that

Yeah
Not in Vienna atleast
A childhood without Asterix & Obelix must be a very sad one
I was able to read them before I was able to write my own name
Austrian here, totally grew up with Asterix and Obelix
My Dad opposed pretty much all other comics and considered them to be worthless literature, but he also love Asterix and we had all books
My favorite one is "Asterix in Britain".
"Can I have a spot of milk in my hot water please
Or when they drive the romans crazy by having their tea break during the battles
"Oh, it´s time". :D
We used Asterix comics in school to learn Latin
I personally prefer the old animated feature films, they were fantastic
I did
Austrian here
Asterix and Obelix, very funny
Verleihnix (Ordralfabétix) literally means "lends-nothing", which I actually find quite fitting for that character
It's our privilege
Switzerland with female suicides looks pretty  nice
I totally mis-read the female graph
I think the crime rate per capita is actually quite high due to tourists and the low absolute population
Also some websites: "Fuck off, we don't want you anymore" as I just found out:
Charles de Gaulle
It even has "the nuclear".

That can't be right
they produced the same amount as the drank
No exporting etc
Prost Burschen und Mädls
Sad to see us Austrians missing, as our beer is clearly above all ;D
I'd be interested what that means in a per capita way
It's far easier to be a huge country and being a huge producer, but that doesn't necessarily say they are the most industrious in that endavour
As an Austrian on the proud second place, i tip my hat
That's quite a lead you got there
I thought that we were close since Austria is number 2
Holy shit
Looks like CGI
damn nice
What did we do again
Austria is neutral, so unless you're counting Afghanistan I don't know when they ever went to war
In which war did the neutral austria participate since ww2
What
Austria
What war are we talking about
Iceland participated in [ISAF] in Afghanistan, which seems to count here as war (same thing for Austria and Finland)
There is always a bit of grey zone with peacekeeping and other UN sanctioned security missions (such as ISAF)
Finally Iceland also seems to have had 2 soldiers in the Iraq war
Welcome to the Club (Austria, Finland - perhaps others)
It seems they count some UN mandate missions (such as ISAF) as wars
Has to be selective somehow, as Switzerland also participates but they are listed as 0
> Welcome to the Club
This map is hot garbage
The one in Afghanistan was a peace keeping and humanitarian mission tough
If you were to include this one you would have to include all of them (e.g. Bosnia, Kosovo, Mali, Lebanon, etc
) - [here's a list of all foreign deployments by our military]

We have even more micro-states in Europe
Liechtenstein, Monaco, Vatican City, Malta
sadly not

Interesting that Germany imports way more from the EU than outside of the EU
I wonder how their trade balance would look if you only look at Germany - EU trade
I hate how these businesses are trying to bully the EU into weakening regulations by blaming their shady behavior on them

Americans can be lucky, that they don't bring the good, cheap European cars to the US
They don't even sell the VW Polo or Skodas over there
Somebody needs to repeat that to Americans everyday
American cars are shit, pure unadulterated shit
Except for Tesla
There's one American automaker who's quite prevalent on European streets: Tesla
After Snowden leaks, Software or Hardware (Firewalls) with "made in the USA" should be less popular
But its not and this is why we need to create more awareness
I see them relatively often
About 1% of the cars I'd say
Though, they do stick out because of their sleek design
I am pretty sure that we have good developers in Europe
The difference is that we are 100% sure that NSA is able to spy us
Thanks to the one aho made the graph and didnt put austria in it xD
Depends on what "global power" means
If it means increasing military spending to anywhere close to US levels, I am definitely against that
If people focused on that and are part of NATO I can kinda understand that
it's fascinating that people live in places like that

A lot of countries don't have a system of dual education and in some you get a Bachelor (counting as tertiary) for a job that is only availabe via Apprenticeship (secondary) here
Using international/US based categories for regions with a system that very different results in "bad" prejudices even if the education itself is better
Yeah, probably the map doesn't account for different education systems at all
Holy shit
Who are the perpetrators
Curious what's the rent on such a flat

Looks like they might get a problem in 200-300 years
Except if they reinforce the rock with some extra material to guard it from the sea
So is this anti muslim or anti DUP
Abortion and especially abortion after rape is not forbidden in Islam
I was taught that it is indeed allowed in the first few months of pregnancy
But after a certain point of development it is indeed looked down upon
I don't believe in it
I still wanted to point it out though
Why even bother with what
Most conservative parties do have programs and members that are homophobic, sexist and racist
Those are facts, not accusations
No worries, MS is doing much of the invasive stuff in W10 also in the EU
The biggest difference is what you did when you installed it
Do you use a microsoft account or do you log in without one (yeah the setting is quite hidden), did you opt-out of all tracking stuff (yeah it is pre selected), do you use the start menu
(thats one point where I see most advertisements)
Here a short twitter thread about some of it
To add to this, all forms of contraception were banned in Romania until Ceasescu's death, causing the very tragic story of the decretei  If anyone has ever wondered why there were so many charity appeals and international adoptions of Romanian babies and children in the nineties, this is why

A particular german news outlet tried it
Google just stoped linking them and in the end they got less traffic and less income
But let's try it again
maybe it will work the second time right
The entire link tax just won't work out as expected
If I would be FB or Google I would simply block everyone which asks for money ONCE
Nothing simpler then adding the link into a database which blocks it on my site
Guess whut happened to a certain german news outlet after google blocked them
Their traffic broke down suddenly
who could have guessed that
And with this also their income form the online website
But let's try it again
this time it will work for sure
British cuisine isn't "shit", it's just very unremarkable
For most other countries in Europe I can easily think of one or even multiple signature dishes that are both delicious and somewhat unique
When I look up british cuisine it's mostly minor variations of basic stuff you'll find almost everywhere
If there are hidden gems then they're not well known

welcome to austria
Stop living in shit houses then
Last time I have 1
5mbit was ADSL1 in the late 90s (Perth)
Now on lovely 1000/50 fttp
oof that is rough, I've lived all over as well and the worst was Newman mobile internet mostly when everyone was coming off day shift and saturating the towers
Otherwise been very fortunate and msot of my ADSL2 services would be around 15mbit
Specifically bought current house as it was in an FTTP area during early times of NBN
although looking at my old house it would have won the node lotto (as much as 1 can being on FTTN)
How far along the roadmap are you to get NBN put in
I guess being at the tail end you may well be lucky enough to dodge FTTN and get FTTC or maybe even FTTP now that they've backflipped and starting to roll that out again
In my local supermarket eggs are in the refrigerator
I don't know but Austrians usually put eggs in the fridge
This varies in my own experience
Spar usually has them refrigerated while Lidl doesn't.
I do always put them in the fridge when I get home though
If nothing else, it's the easiest/most convenient place to store them
We should donate our [Walser Berg (483m)] to you guys
I once went hiking in the alps and one of my new colleagues was coming with me and some friends - he was from the Netherlands - so we start walking - an easy hike from 1500 to 2500 meters in 7 hours or so - he forgot something in the car and I told him that we will wait - he said no - we shall go ahead since he is running marathons - well - let's say that the thin mountain air even on just over 1500m was a bit more then he expected
I think he might be referring to the largest war theatre and highest casualties in world history when those countries were at war for almost half a decade
Slightly more relevant, no
So is this really how it happened, they built those beautiful solid structures for an Expo only to be removed 6 months later
Man that's something else
I love the commitment to grandeur
By that logic, the Munich Accord and the German-Polish partition of Czechoslovakia started the war
It's crazy to me that Conservative parties up and down the continent seem to be emulating Sebastian Kurz

Quite interesting that brits heard of Austria but 2% never heard of Germany

Oh, shove it up your ass
Your hypocrisy is astounding
And yes, Germans ARE in fact morally superior than Americans for the most part
How many millions of people did the US slaughter in the past
You do realise that the establishment of Indian Reservations in the US were an influence on Nazi concentration camps, right
Germans are morally superior to Americans
You know why
Because most Germans today do not cling to stone age beliefs and religious propaganda like Americans
The US is a nation that executes minors, even to this day
You cannot get much more ‘morally inferior’ than that
Let’s not forget the ‘morally superior’ denial of medical care to people who lack the money
Those are all surely signs of a truly ‘enlightened’ society
Oh, but of course you’ll defend them, since ‘daddy’ Amerika is the only reason your pos scumbag apartheid country still exists
You willingly accept billions of USD of aid from them a year whilst millions of Americans cannot even afford a pot to piss in
Nice
Ah, it should say "Grease"!

everyone is burning meanwhile we in Austria have a shitton of rain and ~15°c. love it
Sweet home Austria
Why is it so 'cool' though here in austria
I'm not complaining we still get hot rainy days like wtf but it's noticeably cooler than last summer, at least up til now
Wait
you have internet in Iceland

I would like to refer you to this relevant wikipedia article I stumbled upon last week when I was on holiday in another EU country:
My experience in Hungary was the one third speaks some German, one third speaks some English and the rest only speaks Hungarian
Probably a bit better in the 15-20 range, though
All Finnish students also learn Swedish
And I think language education is taken more seriously than in Hungary
Minden blown

hehe, first I had to look it up to make sure there was no special u-after-g-but-not-ü rule coming into play; the finer points of Spanish orthography can get tricky for me (especially when you throw Catalán into the mix)
Looks quite straightforward to me now though
Maybe it is because in the Austrian variant of German, we also tend to do "lazy" g's like in Spanish ("In Austrian German, intervocalic /b, d, ɡ/ can be lenited to fricatives [β, ð, ɣ]" conf
"The phonemes /b/, /d/, and /ɡ/ in Spanish are realized as approximants (namely [β̞, ð̞, ɣ˕]")
I can already hear it in my mind though how it would sound in a more North German, tight /u/, lenis /k/ accent

For those who don't know, the Parliament usually sits in Brussels and specifically travels to Strasbourg for plenary sessions just because the Treaties require it
The odds are as good as they'll ever get
Macron seems like he's actually passionately in favor of making the EU succeed
Maybe he'd be willing to let go of this purely symbolic charade in exchange for housing a first-class European academic institution
The NSA keeps getting smarter
a shame though that the Strasbourg hemicycle is definitely the better looking of the two
Well, sort of yes and no
Firstly, the College d'Europe was founded in the spirit of the pan-European movement, but it's in no way affiliated to the EU, but rather a private college subject to Belgian law
Its student population is tiny at less than 500 and the curriculum contains only law and political science
What many envisage is a public institution tied to EU law where actual research is conducted (instead of being focused on teaching), at a much larger scale, a competitive budget, all branches of science represented, in the same spirit as Erasmus
your dirty hands off my beautiful blue hemicycle

Yeah there are a lot of origins of English in Nordic languages even tho they don’t necessarily mean the same thing
for instance when I was younger I was very confused about the word tungsten because in Swedish it literally means heavy stone even tho it’s a metal
Yeah there are a lot of these words for example gift=married kiss=pee slut=end fart=speed etc
sometimes I imagine the Norwegian guy invading England had is dictionary completely f up

That explained a lot
