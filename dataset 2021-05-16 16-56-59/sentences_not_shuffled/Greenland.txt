We live in igloos, ride polar bear, everyone hunts, we eat fish all the time and that we have winter all year round
And these specifically are from the country which we are apart of its Kingdom
>How's life in Greenland
Quite all right, seems normal
>Wich language do you guys speak
Most of us speak danish as we are a part of the danish kingdom, though many speak Greenland and English
Which three of these languages are in our school curriculum and many are competent at all these
>Is internet fast there
It really depends where you are, though as I live in the capital our internet speed varies from 30/5 Mbit/s, 10/2Mbit/s and 2/1 Mbit/s in which you've bought (177
84 USD, 163 USD and 74 USD respectively)
>Is it depressing being so few in such a big country
It is as I've heard depressing in the more rural cities and sometimes can be in the capital
As our sunlight daily changes depending on the season (winter light for 4 hours, where as 23 hours in the summer)
>Wich currency is used
The currency we use is Danish Krone which is 6
74 DKK = 1 USD
>How's economy
Don't really know, but seems all right, we are building many buildings, as there seems to be a housing problem and new airports are being built
Three to be specific
(Keep in mind we get grant from the Danish Government
504,346,140 USD yearly)
>Would you like to move out to another country
If yes, wich one
I would move to Denmark, as I would like to start studies
And education is limited in choices
>Is amazon available there
Sadly not entirely, though some items that ship here are
No problem happy to give some light to the country I've lived in
The economy is hugely based by it yes exporting to various countries, but no most people work office jobs
Though some of my friends are working in the fishing industry, as there is really good money (like 20,000 USD in three months)
No, we had a delightful summer last year
Super warm, dry and long days
With new high temperature up to 23 celsius which was 2 degrees warmer than debark at the time
I think as the years go by, we'll see our national teams slowly go international through sport
Recently we hosted Pan American Handball Tournament, which we got 2nd place in IIRC
And we've recently had a Greenlandic player join the Danish national team for football again IIRC
And I do believe we sometime, could be playing in various football competitions but every other teams like Argentina and Germany are at a whole nother league compared to us
Yes I would love to see the day it becomes, but currently we are not economically independent nor politically enough to reach that goal in the next 10-20 years
As we get a yearly grant from Denmark, to sufficiently run our country
Though over the years from 2009 we've slowly gone the road to Independence
And few politicians thinks we should be independent by 5 years
Which I think isn't entirely wise
Yeah it is expensive and in the next few years we will hopefully have access OneWeb or Starlink
And how are the prices in Italy
I was curious as everyone was, if it was a joke
Then the media really picked it up and was fun watching the whole worlds reaction to it too though knew already that wouldn't happen
You might want to get your DNA checked
Life on an iceberg with some dirt sucked
Seriously, I don’t give a fuck about “the natural untouched beauty” that people talk about
You get used to it
It’s cold, remote and horrible most of the year
Food is limited and you get sick super easy
Norway is your bro but u my daddy Denmark
It’s nice, cold, population is small and I think I know most people around me
Can be a little boring sometimes because there is no big buildings or skyscrapers but there’s always things to do and it’s pretty laidback imo
We mainly got our money from fishing, tourism and grants from Denmark
Denmark is basically our ~~sugar~~ daddy
wouldn’t it be nice to have Denmark as dad and Norway as mom
Geographically: north america
Politically Europe
Feels more European tbf we learned Kalaallisut (greenlandic language) and Danish in school
The country is closely tied to Denmark
So I’d say more Europe than north america
There are lots of similarities between Kalaallisut and Inuk of Nunavut territories, but that’s the only thing that connects Greenland to America basically
I think we’re in comfortable position to have good enough independence but not fully independent
Ad harsh as it sounds, Greenland isn’t a country with many resources for trades
What are we supposed to sale to the world and how are we gonna get stuff, let’s say, from China to be delivered all the way to Greenland
As of 2008 Greenland is a self-governing country, we can make our own laws etc but we’re still a part of Denmark
In 2009 Denmark basically said that Greenland can be independent if it wants to be, but I remember around 70% people voted no because honestly we’re afraid of losing/lowering our living standards if we no longer receive help/grants/sharing market with Denmark
(I don’t have news resources or link, this is purely memory based, but you can find it in google I’m sure)
I’m sure some people out there want independence, but most people, as of now, say no
I’ve been living abroad of Greenland for some time and will be back at 2022, so I don’t really know the current situation, but I’m sure people’s pov doesn’t change dramatically
In a country where everything is covered in ice sheets and resources are not plenty, being under Denmark’s wings is the safest
(Imo)
Go for a hike
Alone
In the winter
Inland
My Grandfather Beat up Your Grandfather nerds
It’s either tex mex fredag or no taco at all
Ouch, the burn
Came to Amsterdam to get high, get addicted to stroopwafels instead
I do, but never happens here
as a person who speaks 5 languages I know there is an unstopable change in personality whenever I change my language
I noticed, but I can’t help it
“We’re just crossing your territory to reach somewhere don’t mind us”
Yes you did
And so is in literally everywhere in New Zealand
You know what’s worse than invading Russia at winter
Invading Finland at winter
Greatly cover the fall of democracy in 40 and the fall of Denmark and the use of Greenland as a jumping off point
Other then that not much else
Your country is now merged with its closest neighbor
Happy marriage or instant Balkans scenario
Jesus, that’s a **LOT** of comments
Dude this post is over 100 days old
A tough read with the subject being alcoholism and neglect
The book by Sørine Steenholdt Zombieland, is recommended by me
Though I don't know if it is available widely in other countries
Lol this looks like a facebook post
well reddit is the new facebook anyway :D
So you'd rather walk
Tumblr or Deviantart or Twitter have like millions of teenagers who could draw this
Sorry US, out present socialist government is only speaking for about a third of the population
Not a chance, Scotland is right behind UK
The Grand Master Plan for a United Socialist Europe is falling apart
Good Riddens
Some archeologist is gonna find this in 4000 years, and think we were all complete idiots
To expand on the million troops two weeks before the war part
These are the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France and the Soviet Union, not to be confused with the later tripartite pact between Germany, Japan and Italy
The negotiations were held in Moscow, and the Anglo-French delegations traveled by ship in order to not irritate Hitler, the slow progress of the delegation did not however suggest that the French or British was taking this serious, so they irritated the Soviets instead
This was further compounded when the delegations arrived
The Soviet delegates were the top guys, Litvinov (sacked and then replaced by Molotov), Molotov, Voroshilov, Shaposhnikov and several others
The British sent Admiral Reginald Drax and the french sent General Joseph Doumenc
No foreign affair ministers, no top military guys
To make matters worse the Anglo-French delegates didn't have the necessary authority to actually make a agreement
The Soviets offered to commit 120 divisions, which would be between 1
2 million to 2 million men to fight the Germans, and within the first year they claimed that number would be 250 divisions
The British said they could deploy 16 divisions, but when they were pressed they admitted the actual number was 4
The French could field a few more divisions as they would have around 80 divisions featuring in the battle of france one year later, but for Soviet purposes they were interested in divisions ready for offensives into Germany, and so of those 80 we would end up with some 10-30 divisions being available from the French (I have not seen a exact number offered)
It isn't exactly a wonder that the Germans were able to sweep in and secure a deal, especially when the Germans had been the power that the Soviets had the best relationship with before Hitler
Not photoshop

It's an abomination
Depends on whether you are asking a former west or east German, I guess
- once the commitments have been voted in by Congress, the US as a country can't go back from them
Not true
The constitution requires the House and the Senate to make a treaty, but the constitution does not provide explicit direction for leaving a treaty
The authority for President Jimmy Carter to unilaterally annul a treaty, in this case the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, was the topic of the Supreme Court case Goldwater v. Carter in which the court declined to rule on the legality of this action on jurisdictional grounds, thereby allowing it to proceed
The Supreme Court dismissed the lawmakers’ challenge, saying foreign affairs issues were political ones, not judicial, and this was a fight for Congress and the executive branch to sort out among themselves
If U.S. President Donald Trump decides to withdraw from NATO tomorrow, Congress might not be able to stop him
Members of NATO may withdraw after a notification period of a year, under Article 13 of the Washington Treaty
Such a delay would give Congress time to try blocking any attempt by Mr
Trump to leave
Any blocking legislation would require 2/3rds of both the house and Senate to override a veto
- But Congress could have overridden Carter on that issue
That's different than what you first claimed here: "once the commitments have been voted in by Congress, the US as a country can't go back from them
The US as a country CAN go back in them (by the President), the US HAS gone back on them
2/3rds of Congress can stop the US from going back on them
In the case of Carter they didnt
We don't know for sure if Congress would override Trump on NATO
- Congress can easily pass a decision to appropriate funds to NATO as part of a budget resolution
First; a budget resolution wont fund a shut down government
Again you would need 2/3rds of both houses of congress
Trump currently has about a 90% approval rating among Rebublicans and they won't and have not overriden either a veto or shut down
Second; NATOs direct budget could easily survive the loss of U.S. funds
Every NATO member state contributes to a relatively modest direct budget: a roughly $1
4 billion military budget and a $250 million civilian budget
The US pays 22% or ~$365 million
What's important is total NATO collective defense spending and the promise to use it
Among all member states which totals more that $936 billion in 2018
US defense spending accounts for roughly 67% of this
In NATO or out, the U.S. will probably still spend about the same in its defense budget
This is not true for many European nations
If the U.S. was to pull out of NATO, countries closer to Russia, like say Germany, would probably be forced to really beef up their spending from the miniscule 1
2% of their GDP
Countries like Poland might also feel the need to really beef up and pressure countries like France and the UK to chip in
The biggest loss would be command and control
For most allies, certain high-end conventional U.S. military capabilities, and an independent strategic-level nuclear deterrent, would be out of reach, due to cost or level of technology
Examples include large deck aircraft carrier battle forces, upper layer ballistic missile defense interceptor capability, advanced stand-off electronic warfare capability, and large-scale, globally-deployable logistics capabilities
The Alliance depends mainly on the United States for these long-range power projection-related capabilities that have high conventional deterrence value
Some allies have some of these capabilities, in limited quantities, but if they were not able to operate as part of a multinational force that includes predominantly U.S. enabling capabilities, most allies would not be able to mount an effective deterrent, nor conduct high intensity or large-scale, long duration operations
Your right about budget resolutions but Trump has proven he will just shut down the government, meaning you will need the 2/3rds to open the government to pay NATO
That Bill may have passed the (D) controlled House, but has yet to pass the (R) controlled Senate
I'm not even sure the Senate leader will even let it come to a vote
He has stopped the vast majority of House bills by not even voting on it
Seems to be working
Even with an incredibly unorthodox President and deadlocked Legislature the government is stable and the nation prosperous
