How terrible we have suppressed the Sami people and how we forcefully assimilated them in order to “fit in” with the “Norwegian culture”. And how the racism against them still exist very much to this day
They are still treated horrible by Norwegians and we are barely learned anything about their history in our schools
The [Jew clause] was the second paragraph of the Constituion of Norway when it was written in 1814
It specifically banned Jews and Jesuits from entering the kingdom
The clause roughly translates as:                       «The Evangelical-Lutheran religion is the state's public religion
The inhabitants who practice it are obliged to raise their children in the same
Jesuits and monastic orders may not be tolerated
Jews are excluded from access to the Kingdom»
The article was not deleted until 1851
Yeah, pretty much the same thing happened in Norway
yeah the ‘one language’ policy of france is really sad
so much diversity lost when there was no reason for it to be
>we are barely learned anything about their history in our schools
Really
We do learn quite extensively about the Sami, including Norwegianization
At least in the school I went to
wait that’s where ‘saturday candy’ comes from
we have it here too, i never knew it was a scandinavian thing and not a more global thing
i guess i’ve just never thought about it
Then you were lucky
I learned nothing about them in primary school(barneskolen) and learned a little bit about their language in 9th and some about their religion in 10th grade
I wish I instead had your school
There is a lot of general racism like removal of any signs that have the Sami language on it, or comparing them to clowns and other horrible comments
However while their have been improvements, there is still systemic oppression
Most prominent in the fact that many schools don’t adapt for the Sami people’s right to have education in their language
This means that many Sami languages are on the verge of disappearing all together, and they are directly oppressed from their rights
Research has also shown that 50% of the Sami people in Norway have experienced discrimination
Edit: wanted to add they are also highly underrepresented in multiple platforms, I.e education or media
general racism
they’re treated equally by law, and now also have the right to preserve their own language and culture, but there’s still tons of racist people
especially up north because of ethnic tension
alot of sami move south, don’t even know their language and completely abandon being sami, which is sad
the sami culture is pretty awesome imo
It has gotten a lot better today
They have their own “council” where they vote for stuff and alike
Although they can’t make anything go into action there because they are only coming with suggestions
Luckily most of the things they come up with though goes through without problem
The not so fun part of the Sami is that most live in Oslo
And that many of their writers and alike actually write in either of our two languages and not their own
Ahh yes
That is horrific
We were showing what would happen if you were a “tyskertøs» (meaning german slut) by having pictures of girld having theor hair cut off, and having their clothes ripped off
we didn’t learn alot in primary either, but we did during highschool, especially when we had about northern languages and norwegian language history
i don’t think you’re supposed to learn any of that before at least like 8th grade or smt
idk though, that’s just speculation
There are approximately 40,000 Sami in Norway, and most of them live about as far from the cultural center (Oslo) as you can get
In comparison there are almost 100,000 Polish immigrants
I definitely wouldn't say they're underrepresented when they make up less than 1% of the population
There have been several prominent Samis in the media over the years
Also, the point about the schools is just plain wrong
No matter where in the country they live, Samis have a right to get their education in Sami if they so wish
That being said, there's no doubt they have been discriminated against in the past, but it's definitely going in the right direction
Blatantly false narratives like this doesn't help at all however
That's most likely just a myth
huh
do you know if the tradition is common outside of sweden+norway
outside scandinavia/the nordics
We learnt about some of this in 7th grade, but definitely not enough or even close to everything
this was my source, you have to scroll for a while to find the information on underrepresentation
And here was my source on issues in education that takes place in the Sami language
yeah that’s definetly true either way
we don’t really learn enough about our ethnic minorities and their culture and language
like, i bet most norwegians haven’t even heard about Kvens or Forest Finns
The point is that most Sami live about as far away from the Norwegian cultural center as northern Italians do
You could argue the exact same thing about anyone living in the north (and the districts in Norway often complain that the media is Oslo centric)
The report states that Sami who ask for education in Sami are getting it
The problem is that a lot of the non-Sami districts simply aren't aware that it's a thing, which makes sense since for most of them it's never going to be an issue
But it's given when asked for
I haven't had time to read the entire report, so what do you consider to be the major problems from it
well considering we just go to you’re country and buy kilos at a time i’m not surprised
but for real, i had no idea it was that much compared to the rest of europe
like i thought the netherlands was bad
do you know what those stats include
chocolate, chips, seigmenn
I actually hadn't heard about neither of those
Just goes to show how bad it actually is
We also basically don't get any LGBTQIA+ education in primary and secondary school
We have our own media in Northern Norway though
I dont really feel like media is a problem
I dont live in Finnmark or Troms, but here in Nordland we got NRK Nordland, for television news, and lots of smaller and bigger newspapers
that’s true, it should be rolled into sexual undervisning
apperently we eat 7
6kilos of salty snacks every year
but that was in 2007 so idk how accurate it is nowadays
Absolutely
And the sexual education should be made longer
From 5 days to a month or something, to get a more in-depth knowledge of it
That way we could maybe get more deeply into it instead of skimming over it, and we could go over more stuff
yeah absolutely, the only thing i remember about it was our school nurse came in with some dildos which we obviously just dicked around with, and they gave us some condoms
lmao same
I think I was the only one actually interested in what she had to say and learn anything
And yeah I also basically don't remember anything, and I had this in February this year
^^dicked ^^around ^^lol ^^nice ^^pun
i was struggleing with the wording of that because usually i would’ve said ‘fucked around’ but in the context that wouldn’t work, i aslo thought about ‘played with’ but again, it’s wrong haha
hahaha, yeah 'fucked around' and 'played with' could have been taken wrongly
We could do with a longer coastline
Sorry, Sweden
Italy, now we have the Vatican island
Sweden
Italy because Italians are the worst, loudest, and most annoying people in the world
What about Andorra and Gibraltar
Even when you're the happiest country in the world, you're not happy

15 weeks paternity leave for dads is pretty good
€100 paid out per child every month to every family, regardless of their level of income
We got the same in Norway
All of my bottles and cans get recycled because of it pretty regularly in fact, so it's quite effective
That is spectacular
Well done Poland
Way more popular than I thought then
This adds to the list of things that makes me proud of being European
Oh you have it too
Cool
Nice
There have been politicians here talking about only giving it to families that actually needs the money
But I have come to the conclution that I prefer it the way it is
That way the families who pays the most taxes (both parents in high end jobs), also feel they get something back from their taxes
But that is just my personal opinion of course
Here it lasts till the child is 18
Not working though, less and less children being born
I personally think we need to change parent leave back to how it was before (someone's going to shoot me for this
) when mum had more weeks than dad
Many mothers feel it's too early to go back to work when the baby is only 7 months
And it's not like dad can breastfeed, or drive the baby to the workplace every time the baby needs food
(Ok
I said way more about that than I planned
Congrats on your independence Scotland
Want to be a part of our kingdom next
I'm honestly impressed
I thought he was so far out there that he would never become PM, but then again I thought the same about Trump
Thanks for the oil
A few months after we got independence, we were invaded by Sweden and forced into a union for almost a century
Bruh
thanks for the oil
When the british successfully provoked Germany to invade Norway in order to justify their own expedition to stop the supply of iron ore
Then, when they were about to crush the germans at Narvik and potentially keep Northern Norway free, they went home, leaving us to 5 years of occupation
Maybe the UK causing Germany to invade us by sinking a German ship near us I guess
(WW2)
Im sorry
You can have a 100g chocolate bare for €5 if you want
What, historians agree Hækkerup was not Danish
Poverty in Norway wear many faces
It can be the kids who don’t seem to have what the majority got in terms of clothes, toys, electronics, holidays, sports memberships, other activities and experiences
It can be the immigrant worker who traveled here to get a better life and wage than at home, but in general and reality is exploited living on bad conditions, working illegally long hours and given salaries way below average for their work placed in a shitty accommodation
It can be the single mom who works an over average good job, but strives getting her ends to meet and sometimes has problems feeding her children and giving them and herself all they need, she got bills to pay including rent and payments and service on her older car
It can be the sick one who lives off benefits because he’s too ill to work due to unfortunate circumstances, maybe having kids to care for, maybe not, stuck in a council flat in a smaller town or in the middle of nowhere
It can be the Somali family consisting of mom and her children who’s dad got killed in the civil war living a few blocks down or maybe next door, she speaks better and better Norwegian now, but nobody will hire her except for shitty low wage jobs, the immigration department and social services office play games with her she can’t ever understand because of language and cultural barriers
It can be the lovely older couple down your street, the old grey haired lady who spends the whole summer trimming and caring for those magnificent rose bushes and flowers, they barely get by on their minimum pension
Due to our welfare system, no matter how poor you are you still have access to housing, transport, and are able to pay basic bills and buy food with some budgeting
You might buy second hand clothes for your children whenever possible
You still have access to healthcare and higher education
You’re probably a student living from a student loan of roughly 900€ a month
Rent is probably 450-700 € for a bedroom in a shared apartment
That should leave you with 150-300€ left after rent, electricity and insurance
Food is anywhere between 100-200€ and then you might have 50-100€ left for beer, clothes, subscription services and other costs
In the larger cities you’ll need a part time job to live comfortably
When you finish your degree you’ll have roughly 21000-35000€ in debt
It Can also vary a lot depending where in the country you live(mainly due to housing/rental prices)
But as you said, it can depend a lot
There are definitely homeless people though, I have seen them
They walk around the with a shopping cart filled with all of their belongings(blankets mainly) and empty bottles and cans
They dig through the trash, and sit on benches the majority of the time, before they head over to their chosen sleeping spot for the night and hope no police will find them
It’s very sad
Officially, students are explicitly left out of the poverty statisitcs
Absolutely, some of these tendencies are more prevalent in Oslo than elsewhere, especially since it’s the most expensive property market
I also forgot to bring in the homeless and particularly Rumanian beggars who live in absolute poverty by several measures
The few homeless people are mainly drug addicts though, and sometimes not willing to quit
Generally, at least as far as I understand you will be provided free housing as long as they know you won't be using the place for doing drugs etc
Many of them are simply not able to really live in a home
Romani beggars are probably a different story
One of the many exciting challenges that comes with student life
Less meat, a lot of pasta and noodles and cheap bread
It is fully doable if you cook everything at home and plan dinners in advance
No, university is free apart from books, so student loans are supposed to cover your living expenses
Well, we’ve probably had some of those reportages here as well, but I doubt that counts for all or most of them really
My point is what we see here in Norway, the conditions they live under here aren’t worthy and pretty shocking
That means regardless of why they come here or even the question of if they should come here or what they should be offered here
Toro and knorr are probably the most common
Yes, i have forgotten some norwegian words so i prefer english and if i'm writing norwegian i mostly use autocorrect to help me if i do anything wrong,
I am learning german and wondered if the germans have problems with the gramar since it seems so complicated, so know I now
Tror ikke det er tillat for øyeblikket
I'm pretty happy with my own, though i try to figure out how to learn a real, as-native-as-possible general London accent
And then a Dublin-like accent, I struggle more with that
I'm also just happy with it because I think the Norwegian accent is one of the least sexy accents out there, imo
I really don't want to sound typical Norwegian, and although I don't mind sounding foreign, I just have fun learning accents, and it's a skill goal to nail one perfectly
Yes but actually No, i don't have the "normal" accent but i still feel very uncomfortable speaking it even tho i swear almost every second
I can speak with a Norwegian, British, Indian and American accents, but I consider the one I speak normally as
normal
I think the accents that's from an English speaking country is cooler than my normal accent
Norwegian here
I've been living in the UK for 8 years now but my accent is still noticeable
It can be irritating sometimes, but mostly I like it because when I meet new people, they can never tell where I'm from
I've gotten American, Italian, French, South African, Austrian, New Zealand, and so on
You'd be surprised at how confident people are when they guess too
Always pretty funny and a good icebreaker
Lived in Australia for 5 years, married to an Aussie
Yeah, I don’t mind sounding like an Aussie
No I dont like it
Just look at Norwegians who try to speak english on YouTube
My experience as well
No one ever seems to complain about accents
(If you happen to misspell an English word on reddit however
I know people who "need" an iphone because "its the best phone". I also know people who earn very (!) good money who owns a android phone
And because more people than not have iphones here, I make sure I don't. How else will I teach my children that your value as a person is not in buying the most expensive thing
Iphones are like a trend in Norway, the more people that have them, the more are going to buy them, because they are not compatible with android
A lot of people will buy the newest iphone as soon as it releases
Personally I hate Apple and won't touch their products with a 10ft pole
In my social groups, it's pretty much the same as this, except the last point
If a guy has an iPhone, he's definitely more likely to be considered a bit of a tech dummy though
I'm certain there's a large gender difference as well
I dont even know what whatsapp is, dont think any norwegians use it
This is spot on
I'm the tech support in the whole family, and people with iPhones are fucking useless with tech
Two of the groups are mostly university educated and two of them are mostly not, and it's the same across all of them
If they're tech savvy, they have an Android, if they're not, an iPhone
With some exceptions of course
Same here in Norway, also young people use snapchat
Pretty much the same age group here
Mid 30s to early 40s. Price is only relevant as an argument against wasting money on the (sometimes perceived, sometimes actual) inferior product that is the iPhone
The city I'm currently studying in, Førde, is widely considered to be the ugliest in Norway, due to the shitty weather and dull, blocky buildings, even though there's been built quite a lot of new, prettier buildings recently
The surrounding nature is very pretty tho, and the sunsets here are usually very pretty
Reading through the comment have made me want to visit Urk
I’m probably gonna be dragged for this by my fellow norwegians, but I’ll have to say Oslo
That’s where 98% of all the shit in this country happens
I’m not from Oslo, but I’ve been there a hundred times and I’ve never liked it there
You can read about gang violence, murders and stabbings going on down there all the time in the news
I also think it’s a quite ugly town
It’s a concrete soup in a hole between boring hills of pine
If you want to visit Norway and see what it’s really like, please avoid Oslo
Oslo doesn’t represent Norway at all
That’s my opinion
Bergen
It's not the city just the people
They are great, but they are way too loud
Drammen, in Oslo’s outer suburbs
There’s a big, quite ugly bridge on the largest highway in Norway that cuts right through the industrial/port part of the city
Also the rest of the city used to be like the part seen from the highway bridge: heavily industrialised, ugly, run-down and dirty, but a major urban transformation project in the last 20 years has turned it into a very nice place to live and visit
The reputation from old times has however stuck
There is a saying in Norwegian: «Heller en dram i timen enn en time i Drammen
» that means «I’d rather have a shot of liquor every hour, than spend one hour in Drammen
» («dram» = a shot or small glass of liquor)
>the city has ENORMOUS problems that nobody seems to fix
What kind of problems
Is it problems that could be fixed quite easily, but it doesn't happen because of the politicians, or would it take a lot of time to fix
Pekey fokin blinders
You're just scared of Danny
Very unlikely, as far as I've heard, but no problem
Pre-1970 Førde was a smaller farming town with just a couple hundred people, and large industry didn't really pop up until then, so even though Førde did have a sizeable German  presence, with bunkers and checkpoints and whatnot (And it was the site of a pretty big dogfight between Allied and Luftwaffe planes, The black Friday), but it didn't really lead to any major developments in the cityscape, aside from the building of an airport I believe
The "real" reason Førde became "ugly" was the very quick development and establishment of large, more industrial employers, like the shipyard (Ankerløkken) and the county's largest hospital (Førde sentralsjukehus) and shopping malls (Handelshuset and Elvetorget) which demanded large, modern facilities, which coupled with the more practical, concrete-y architecture that was common at the time, lead to a blend of really jarringly blocky and bland looking buildings among older residential houses
I'm paraphrasing here, but it's what I've heard anyway
Pretty sure that's Moldova
No worries
Heh, my dad is from the Molde area
Yes, but you have to compare that to the purchasing power parity
How much do you get for those 440 dollars a month
That's just one good though
Things may be expensive, but Moldova had both the lowest HDI and GDP per capita of any country in Europe
[According to World Economic Outlook and the Human Developement Report
For winter months, sometimes having to shovel snow out of your driveway in the morning or scarping ice from the windows work, even if I don’t use a car
West coast country side Norway here
It wasn’t unusual for someone to excuse themselves by being late to school because they had to catch a sheep that had escaped
Wasnt even a fake excuse, for anyone owning sheep this wasn’t too rare
Snow
On the car
In the driveway, on the roads
Snow everywhere
I had a sunday-driver (slow car) in front of me
I have also used tractor in front of me as an excuse some times
I'm from norway (how do I get thise fancy flags on my post
Ice on the windshield yea, that's a classic and one I've used myself for being late for work
The guy with high salary working from home
We are that one super hypocritical guy that makes the company go through an incredibly tedious bureaucratic process just to buy environmentally friendly paper because it makes them feel better about themselves and then drives home in an SUV
What a great question
I have laughed so many times reading though the comments
The rich guy who drinks a lot of coffee and works 3 hours a day and takes fridays off to go to their cabin
We’re the jolly bouncer
Whenever any of the other countries are fighting, we come in and break it up
And who always takes Fridays off to beat traffic and go to the cabin Thursday afternoon
No, that is France
Sweden is head of HR
No no, [Architect] or some sort of hipster furniture designer
Not any more I guess
Three months
This'll end
I live in the south - here people don't like to travel far, so many own a cabin just 20 min from home, in the same 'kommune'. So they still spend a lot of time there
France, you're fired from the job as a union representative
Position now given to Denmark
Three months, beginning from the first of the following month
So if you tell them the 1st, you'll practically have to stay for four months
No, three months is three months
The whole system is built up around it
Employers hire people three months in advance
I just got a new job, but won't start until August
That's the standard here
Some countries, like Denmark, has a dynamic work market as their ambition
Norway is all about job security
Letting people go is extremely difficult as well, if it is not because of economical issues
You can't just fire someone because they suck at their job
There has to be meetings, documentation that warnings and extra learning/teaching measures have taken place and that the employee still suck at their job after that
Letting someone go because of their shitty performance can take a year, so many employees just give up
There's a test period with every job, though
Usually it's six months
Sacking someone is usually a lot easier then, and the notice is shorter as well
Well, often you have some saved up vacation you can use to shorten the time, and like you say it's possible to reach an agreement, but apart from that 3 months is 3 months
yea, definetly
colour and color, flat and apartment, lift and elevator
use all of them and more interchangably
This 100%. Definitely true for me
I mostly use British English words, spelling and accent
Sometimes I say some things wrong and say it the American way, but I am quick to correct myself
> people often say I write as if I try to sound smarter than I am because I use "big words" but I think that's just the result if you learn English mainly by reading instead of by speaking it
Also they're being anti-intellectual dumbfucks, so who actually gives a shit what they think
[This comes to mind
Strangers talked to me for no reason
I could be walking on the street and a total stranger would come up to me and say "nice jacket" or something similar
Did a road trip with my family through many states in 2011
Specific to New York: the insane height of the buildings
We have a couple of really tall ones in Oslo, like Radisson Blue, but this was on another level
My neck hurt looking at them
Also, noise, but I've also experienced Cairo and Cairo is worse, much worse
In New Orleans: I ordered a "sandwich" called a Po' Boy, and I got a *massive* burger-like thing with probably a whole packet of ham in it
I think I managed to finish half
So yeah, the size of things too
And sooooo much sugar
In hotel rooms: we didn't watch a lot of TV, but when we did, I was very taken aback by the amount of commercials
I watched Cartoon Network as a kid and I remember the screen faded to black and immediately back to whatever I watched like every ten minutes maybe (usually during an exciting part, for dramatic effect)
I realized those blackouts were meant for commercials, but my home country didn't do that
And also commercials for booze
And just in general the *intensity* of them
Some were hilarious though
People: obviously since I'm from Norway, the intense friendliness and people talking to us was a bit weird to me, but I got used to it, and started liking it actually
People gave us compliments and shit
And I remember I was buying something and I was like four or five dollars short and the guy said "nah, it's fine" and I was just like "serously
". People don't really do that here (at least where I'm from, Oslo, people might be more open do a few friendly discounts outside the city)
It feels better when the people talking to you just do it naturally and, even though it might be superficial, they seem to mean it
Also related to that, I mentioned this was in 2011, which means I was there during the 22
July terrorist attack
So many gave us a very genuine and heartfelt "oh I'm so sorry" when we presented ourselves as Norwegian
Probably because they knew what it was like to experience a national shock due to a terrorist attack
So I thank them for that
The feeling that everyone is out to squeeze you for just one more dollar
Granted, I've mostly visited touristy cities (NYC, Miami, LA, San Francisco, Las Vegas), so it might be different in more rural/less touristy areas, but it was all sorts of small things which built up to this feeling, and it made me more wary when I encountered people who seemed friendly, because I'd automatically assume they just wanted money from me
And pretty much everything came with a prize tag
So weird to drive into a national park and paying at a booth to enter
Went first time as an adult to attend a huge tech conference
I hadn't that much of a cultural shock since I already know a lot of American culture from literature and movies, but there where a few things I found amusing, disturbing or just strange
Visited Los Angeles autumn 2008, stayed in a hotel in downtown LA
The rather dilapidated state of public buildings and infrastructure
It's nothing near any third-world country I've visited, but things were more dirty and run-down than I expected
The state of things was more like something you would expect to encounter in some Eastern European countries
I had to wait a bit since my co-worker was held up in immigrationc, and while I waited I was pestered by lots of people asking about donations to different charities in the arrival hall
I'm no stranger to that, but personally I found them way too aggressive - in addition I find it a bit weird that I as a foreigner and non-resident am asked to support some local charity in a city I have no connections to
I'd rather give my money to some junkie at home instead of a strange pastor claiming to collect money on behalf of people I know nothing about
The vastness of the place
I knew Los Angeles was a big city, but I was in no way prepared for the urban sprawl
The number of homeless people
I literally had a guy staring at me through the restaurant window while I ate supper
Some of them just seemed to be really out of it, others seemed disturbingly coherent
I am used to homeless people, but they tend to be junkies or drunks, not people with mental illness or just unemployed
The number of people employed to do basic services
Doormen, bell hops, hostesses, servers, and such
Restaurants, service desks and hotels seemed overstaffed
Which is nice, but
The level of tipping
I get it, some professions live by tips alone
But that means that I pay for the service, and frankly sometimes it feels completely uneccesary
The need to do math at 2 AM in the morning while drunk to settle the bill
I don't want to stiff anybody for their earnings, but sales tax really adds to the confusion
The friendlyness of everybody
People talking to me, even though they're strangers
Which is very nice and cool, but sometimes annoying (especially if I'm hung over)
Flags
EVERYHWERE
The portion sizes
The price of petrol is ridiculous
But the biggest shock for me was how friendly everyone is
Even if its fake I quite like it
Depends on what state
In California i was surprised at how many homeless there were and that we couldn't drink the tap water
In Tennessee i was surprised how involved parents were in their kids lives
Even after turning 18 they are still considered kids as long as they live with their parents
It's like "as long as you live under our roof you will follow our rules". I also noticed how present the cops are everywhere
Police
Everywhere
And apparently what they were used for
I (22 at the time) was there (Utah) visiting my sister (17) who was studying abroad
We were out playing some sort of game, and they told me the cops would round teenagers up and take them back home since it was after curfew
I'm there like, aren't you guys 17
Apparently you're not allowed to be outside after 23 (or 11pm as you say) before you're 18
As someone who had been going as I pleased and doing pretty much what I wanted since I was 13-14, that blew my mind
Not my story but my friends, I think she went to Miami in Florida
And she said her biggest shock was how dumb and immature people was there
Also to add, some of their toilets have gaps in the front of the seats
Really really weird
It's like a horse shoe
My culture shock was also in a toilet cubicle at JFK
But my shock had to do with the doors of the cubicles, that had these wide open gaps where anyone could see through while you were trying to do your business
Made me very uncomfortable and I quickly got out of there once I noticed
I found that this is common in lots of public bathrooms in the US
That's interesting, because compared to Norway, the US is still incredibly formal
They use Sir/Mr/Miss/Mrs (or titles like "professor") and last names in many settings
In Norway, everyone is on a first name basis except the royal family
And that's not an exaggeration
But of course the US is super informal compared to many other European countries, like Germany (although I don't know much about Poland)
> Teens addressing adults by their first name
Wait until you visit Norway
And Sweden
And Denmark
(Not sure about Finland)
In Norway we call everyone by their first names
The teacher
The surgeon
The lawyer
The prime minister
Thats not commen in your country
Its normal to call adults by their first name in Norway
I would think it was really odd if some kid called me by my last name
>Lastly, the gap in the toilet doors
WHY
I would have understood a little gap, but it's so big
Being French you prefer kissing
Most exchange students experience this
But this is a symptom of social classes more than a quality issue
American high schools have jointed classes for all students till the age of 18, while most European countries have different systems for secondary schools, separating sometimes between 14 and 16 years of age
That means that most European exchange students come from the equivalent of *Gymnasiums, Lycees* or *Sixth form colleges*, where they prepare for university education
The academic performence of these students are already in the upper tier
In addition, those students that can afford a year abroad at secondary school is likely from well-off families were the parents have higher education themselves
That will most likely mean that they are among the groups that perform well at their schools
American high schools designed to catch all students aren't really that well suited to high performers and it would be unfair to compare
It's just that the American school system is different
The best US students move on to Colleges and universities too, and the US is home to some of the best universities in the world
> Then I realized that most american almost spend no time outside,
Warm climate
I remember my shock when I visited South Africa in March ones
And after a long summer the white people there hardly had a tan
So me coming from a long Norwegian winter (with no tan
) didn't feel awkward at all
Turns out they stayed out of the sun most of the time because of the heat
So they all had a outdoor area with a roof on where they spent most of their outdoor time, and almost didnt use the garden at all
>The only other place I've consistently experienced people being that considerate of lost foreigners is actually Norway
Wait, really
That's interesting
Would you say that's after Norwegians have been asked for help, or did the Norwegians offer help without being asked
I've been asked for help/directions etc
plenty of times and always help, but have never offered if I haven't been asked first
Yes
We don't really talk to strangers
Unless we're drunk
Haha it was actually just my high school letterman jacket
I had no idea you call it to be "cut"..
> The commercial thing was always annoying as a kid, so it’s lucky that you didn’t have to deal with it
There’s a reason why Americans have been so excited about streaming tv shows and movies with reduced or no ads
I had never thought of that but that really makes sense
Netflix must be a blessing for you guys then (not sating Netflix is not popular here, almost everyone uses it, me included, despite our VASTLY inferior library of movies and series compared to a lot of countries)
> You definitely get your money’s worth with the portions, especially for Southern food
I also have to say I loooooved New Orleans in almost every way
Yes I probably saw most of the more touristy places but those were some GOOD touristy places imo
And I almost cried when we were listening to live jazz in Preservation Hall, it was so beautiful
> I still find it ironic that the upper Midwest which has a massive Scandinavian-American population ended up one of the places with the friendliest people in the US
Hah, that IS kind of weird, but again a lot happens over generations
Guess I should visit the "Scandinavian" parts of the US to see how it is
I've also stopped being annoyed with the whole "heritage obsession" thing, it's honestly kind of cute to me (at least with the "Scandinavian Americans", I've no say in other nationalities)
Most public bathrooms in Norway is not payed for though, unless you live in Oslo I guess
And we don't pay for the ketchup at mcdonalds
Can’t remember seeing them a lot in and around Athens
But yeah, Greeks love Greece
I meant ridiculous as in very cheap
Sorry if you get offended, but that is what she experienced
I know that not everybody is stupid, but for my friend that was a culural shock
Genrally I find americans very talkativ and a tad naive
But for most part you are nice people
Wisconsin and Minnesota had super nice people
Even nicer when they found out I was Norwegian and they could ask me about a phrase their grandma used to say
New York however I could not stand
The pleasantries felt so incredibly shallow and fake
Was it just me being skeptical
And then the day after, you realize how obnoxious you must have been when you were complementing a stranger's mustache while in the 0300 burger line
Oooh yeah, I can totally see that happening
It's also normal for Norwegians to say hi to each other on hikes
There was this one time I blew a tyre and had to wait about an hour for help, and I was invited inside by someone who lived right by the road
I guess I've always looked at that differently than from just randomly walking by someone saying "good morning", "how are you" (which no one wants the answer to) and so on
But hey, I'm glad you think we're nice
I think the fact you were hiking is key here
Norwegians will not say hello to strangers - unless you meet a stranger on a trail in the woods or on a mountain
Then it is rude not to at least smile and nod
People hiking are more vulnerable and Norwegians recognize that because they have been in the same situation themselves, so they know how much a cup of hot coffee or a meal will be appreciated
Thanks
It's my favorite jacket though I don't often wear it
Haha you guys are then VERY similar to what I experience here in Norway
No talk about politics (even though our politics are hysterically boring compared to, well, anywhere), money, personal health and stuff (an exception might be abortion and same sex issues, bc it's not really a big issue here, so we're lucky there)
The passive aggressiveness is also a thing, or just odd and nervous ways to try to NOT cause an argument
> a couple tens of thousands still speak Norwegian (down from a couple hundred thousand a century ago)
Reminded me of, I study linguistics and I got to know of the language Amerikanorsk (American-Norwegian) that is almost identical to (Standard Oslo) Norwegian, but it has certain Englifications like they're saying "kas" (from because -> 'cause) instead of the Norwegian word "fordi", but there's literally like ten speakers left or something
Still, pretty interesting
> I’m glad you’re less dismissive of Americans for heritage stuff since a lot of Europeans seem to love to gatekeep that stuff
Hah, yeah, I've noticed that, at least on the internet (not necessarily that much irl mind you, just to give you some hope that Europeans don't all purely detest Americans
But also yes, their, or "our", opinions have not been in favour of the US since You-Know-Who had his presidency
But yeah, I'm sorry about those guys, they're very mean-spirited in how they write about an entire population on Reddit like that, there's no excuse)
But I mean, yes, it feels weird to "us" if a random American with a great-great grandmother from Norway approaches us as if we're one and the same, but like, what's the problem really
Isn't that just nice
Isn't that just being hospitable
My parents told of this funny thing when they went to the US for the first time (like thirty, thirty five years ago maybe) and they did meet someone who descended from a Norwegian like three or four generations back and he was like "we're practically family
" and were super inviting and stuff
Obv they had very little in common but my mom and dad remembers it with a fondness and thought it was both funny and sweet
And y'know, I've met a Canadian like that, and he had a very Norwegian name, but spoke no Norwegian, but he was very interested in anything I said about Norway so I was more flattered than anything
It's cute, it's funny, I can't relate to the heritage obsession, but my family also has literally lived here for hundreds of years do I have no say in what it means and feels to be a descendant of immigrants
Yeah the price level here is stupidly high
For all our progressive income taxes we make it impressively expensive to be poor
I'm aware of that, but we have a higher income pr capita then most european countrys
Thats why it's expensive
Average salary in norway in 2019 was around 56 000 £ a year, while the average salary in the UK in 2019 was about 30 000 £ a year (I'm using UK since thats is where it says you are from)
So there is a huge difference there
I feel like service here is mostly good
But it depends on where you go
We are tought not to desturb people to mutch because it annoys most Norwegian
In stores we whait a bit before we talk to customers, because mostly they get mad if we don't give them peace
To be honest, in England service was kinda shit as well
But I guess there is not really a culture for it
Or we expect different things because we grew up in different countrys
Well you are offended, and it shows
I don't really think it is
You see several people telling stuff they have heard from others here at reddit
The only difference here is that you got offended and disagreed with my statement
That is completly fine
Where we live, we grow up fast
She was in Miami, and all she heard was wierd statements with misinformation and dumb qustions
She did find respect for a cuple of people, they were very educated on their field and she admired their commitment
The rest apparently had alot of statements about things they had no clue about, and they were generally immature for their age
That is what we call dumb
To be honest I don't get why you get so defensive when it comes to Florida
Even you guys make fun of their intellect
Yeah, but we only pay about 10 more taxes then you so the difference is not to high there
I can probobly guess where you ate pizza based on the price, and yes, its a shitty pizza
The taxation on unhealthy food is really high here as a health mesure
But yeah, some food should be cheaper here
Eating out is more expensive because you pay for more then just the food
But at the pluss side, tipping is completly unnessesary
And most servers don't expect it
Alcohol is really expensive her to hinder people from drinking too mutch
If you buy the food at the store and make it yourself you don't pay as mutch as eating out
I'm curious to know what happened to all the refugees at the Turkey/Greece border
Corona made the news from there completely absent
I honestly can't think of anything
Then again I haven't paid much attention because of how hectic things have been
Luckily nothing, we’re pretty blessed in Norway
The only shitty thing is that, while the EU wants to make it illegal for companies receiving aid to pay bonuses to their CEOs, our conservative government will still allow it
Which is just like, wow
What the fuck, at 13
I mean I don't endorse nazism in any way but that's kinda impressive ngl
Same here, at least nothing that I'm aware of
Saying what
Probably T*ordis* for females and *Odd* for males
Beda, or Olga
Borghild is the most old people name ever
I don't think there's a single Borghild under 80 years
Einar is also reserved for old men
Still a thing in Norway
Almost everyone in my family has a double first name
It seems to be more common in rural areas though
I have an ancestor named Hardenack
Is that name usual now
It seems very old
It's a Hardenack life
Of these feminime names I know 4 that are under 20 named that
However Oda is not old fashioned in Norway, and Ingeborg isn't that ''bad'' either
It's a name I associate with older women, but I know many younger ones too with the name
It's just very common, I guess
I once knew a boy with the unfortunate name Odd Simen
Weird, Inge is a man's name up here
Can confirm, am Norwegian Sami
I think it might be more of a traditional Norwegian thing that has been most preserved in rural areas
In many ways, rural communities tend to be more traditional while urban areas tend to be more innovative
That would be my guess
This is basically how things work when it comes to language and dialects as well
Names usually come and go in waves
Names that were popular 100 years ago suddenly become very common again
I read something about it a while ago
Haha, Yngve is also a male name here
One of us is living in upside down-land
Shot fired
Embrace for incoming Italians ;)
Interesting
TIL
We do use Inga as a female name here
We also have Ingrid
We do use mens names as a prefix in several women's names, such as Ingeborg
We mainly sustain ourselves on our massive hydro electric industry, made by our massive oil exports
As long as we have something to replace it like nuclear power its completly fine
finally some sense
Yeah
I don't think that's true, all industries can be converted to a carbon-free model if we work hard for it
Aviation
More research on hydrogen airplanes, since electric aircraft are unfeasible with today's battery technology
Construction, due to inherent carbon emissions from chemical reactions in concrete
Just don't use concrete
Have your heard about ultra-dense wood
Google it
There are solutions for everything, we just have to identify them and work towards achieving them
I sometimes forget the Norwegian word and say it in English and I feel like other people hate it
No, but it happens quite often that I can only recall the English word and have to search for the Norwegian one
Which is kind of embarrassing at times
Only country ever to ban skateboards
dont have anything else i just really wanted to share that one
We have the northernmost permanent settlment in the world, Ny Ålesund on the island of Svalbard
We were a region of Denmark for almost 400 years and when we almost gained full independence we joined Sweden instead, all because of a complicated series of events relating to the Napoleonic wars where our patriots played a high risk/high reward game to gain independence
We are the all-time best winter olympics nation, having [368 medals, compared to second places US on 305]
We got our massive wealth of offshore oil fields because a [Danish minister] signed a deal with us whilst he was drunk (more of a myth but why not add it)
We are the only country to face Brazil in international football (soccer) and never loose once
2 wins and 2 draws
Salmon sushi was never really eaten in Japan, after a successful Norwegian marketing campaign in the 90s it's now probably the most popular kind of sushi in the world
3  Norway invented the cheese knife, the paper clip and the cheese slicer
Red Bull was banned until 2010-ish as well
EU forced Norway to legalize it
Aren’t skateboard allowed again now
why isn't luxembourgish an EU language
Someone else actually patented the paper clip first, so we don't technically have that one
But we did invent the aerosol can
And we banned colour TV for a while
I hear you did the same in Israel
A member of Parliament said something like "we accept that sin has come to earth, but we dont want it in colours" as a way to ridicule the people who wanted to keep the ban
They were dangerous I guess
My uncle had to buy his in Sweden and smuggle it over the border
Crazy to think about
My dad is from Tel Aviv, and that's what he told me
Might have been exaggerating
I don't think it was meant as a joke, to be honest
His supporters might have found it amusing, but the christian party (that were opposed to colour TV) i guess weren't so amused, mixing in "sin" and all
That there is an influx of bulgarian kids coming here
Eastern europe really seems to have a problem with our child protection service
But are these parents abusing their children since they are convinced child protective services will take them away
Or do they believe children are removed for no reason at all
yeah I know absolutly nothing about that at all
northing
What is gay
We belive the bulgarians will send us our required child offeri- i mean children in great need
lol nice il send em back for ya
Norway is the complete opposite of capitalist, we are taxed into oblivion and we do not have anything similar to a free marked
Agreed, Thousands of people don’t just get housing and everything they need including education without it costing anything
This isn’t some far right conspiracy like the others in this post
Oooh
This is about Bulgarians living in Norway
I thought they believed the Bulgarian child protective services took children away from families inside Bulgaria, and then sent them to Norway
Hence my confusion
friendship ended with sweden
now latvia is my best friend
That's not even remotely true
If anything we have a mixed system, lil bit communist, lil bit more capitalist
The major thing is that CPS only shows up in the news when someone there screws up (or gets accused of screwing up)
End result is that we get a blinkered sense of their performance
Name one aspect of the norwegian economy that is capitalist
Everything on the market is regulated by the government in some form, you can see this on for example the mva, tobacco prices rising almost every year, vinmonopolet
Few other modern economies are this heavily regulated
So calling Norway a mixed system is wrong
And don't get me started on our tax system
How have you it
I have it good at least
Norwegian sentence structure is close english
And now have we all become cavemens, this the thread is amazing
I believe that something of the difficultest with this excerise is those words that are untranslatable
As for example on Norwegian so have we word "sin/si/sitt" for possessions, like in "Michael sin bil" ("Michael's car"), but on English so is there no equivalent word and therefore is it sometimes impossible to direct translate such expressions to English
Ok yes that can I do
I am in the car with the father mine
We drive to the store
I walked me a trip to the store for a little ago
I bought me some snacks and beer for the weekend
Now sit I and shit in the toilet while I write this
I take me a shower later before dinner
In evening can it happen I take to play some computer-games, before I go and lay me
This seems as an interesting exercise
That only problem is that Norwegian grammar is very like English grammar
Norwegian and English are both germanic languages and English has also become influenced of Norwegian in the viking age to a certain degree
All that was was written with fully Norwegian sentence structure and that is this also
Oh, that listens like straight out of moomin land
Here in the mountains, have we actually a sauna too, at the university
But it is closed on ground of corona
I understand not what the message is
We call it storm-airing
"Sin" is more like 's, but as a separate word; "egen" is "own": "Michael sin egen bil" = "Michael's own car".
Yes
Norwegian has not noun cases so the word order must be rigid
But because of the v2 rule put you some times the verb in a different place than in English
We do actually have freer word order than English when you think about it, probably because we had several cases until quite recently
«That car have I not seen before» and «I haven't seen that car before» would be valid and equivalent sentences in Norwegian, but in English only one of them would be valid
YES, 100 %. As for the counter-arguments:
Q: Shouldn't sports and politics be kept separate
A: No, it doesn't work that way
Qatar getting the WC is a political and not a sports-based decision
If we keep "politics" out of sports all we say is that the international sports organisations can do whatever they like and get away with it
Q: But aren't there better ways to do this than a boycott
A: Like what
The point is to do something that is visible
Qatar buys goodwill by hosting sporting events ("sportswashing") and we can't let them continue this way
South Africa eventually became better after decades of boycotts
I don't think many today will advocate that the boycotts were wrong
Q: But it doesn't matter if my small country boycotts
A: Yes, everything matters
Now we should have started this movement earlier, but every country boycotting sends a huge message - just see how we're today taking about T-SHIRTS
And if one country boycotts it's easier for the next to follow
This will not be ignored
Q: But why now
What about Russia four years ago, Chinese Olympics
A: Just because we didn't do the right thing always in the past doesn't mean we shouldn't try to now
If we don't put the foot down it's only going to become worse
What if North Korea bribes its way into hosting the WC
Yes they absolutely should
Unfortunately FIFA is incredibly corrupt and rotten from top to bottom, impressively beating even the IOC in blatant corruption, and every promise of change has and will be broken unless governments start caring
Every part of me wants to play for the first time in 20 years, but I also understand that a boycot is probably for the best
Agreed
I'm very for a boycott against hosting the world cup in Qatar
We know many people have died during construction, it's been reported for a long time
I will honestly not watch even a second of it if (and I think it will) it's still held in Qatar
"Scheiß DFB"
Speaking as a guy from a non-member (but still Schengen) state, yes, ideally
However, priorities and timing are important
Currently international US-anyone relations are a dumpster fire anyway, and obviously Annoying Orange would just try to sabotage this for cheap PR points with his toadies
The next guy may or may not be less of a mentally deficient asshole, maybe there'd just be a better time in a year or so
[shudder] five
Even if Mr
Idiocracy is punted out in 2020 he's still had a massively destabilizing effect and it would probably be in *absolutely everyone's* best interests to not rock the boat for a bit before things have a chance to settle down
Taking a hard line stance on this might be premature even if it would *very* clearly be entirely justified
I'm every bit *as* shocked that I didn't *until* today
But to be fair, Annoying Orange v1 was a lot easier to avoid
It wasn't really stupid, I could have done it, but it wad funny
The prime minister had a press conferance about corona and how we shouldn't shake hands, then proceeded to ALMOST shake hands with another guy before realizing her mistake
It was funny
Similar here
The prime minister informed about the corona situation and that people shouldn't shake hands, then proceeded to shake hands with the other participants at the press conference
Ok but thats fucking funny
I guess that's the one I meant
Made basis for a great song tho
Ikr
It’s just what we needed
The unthinkable has happened here too
We're not allowed to go to our cabins in the mountains
We aren't allowed to drive to Sweden to buy cheap bacon and alcohol
The good old graduation tradition of wearing red overalls and drinking litres of beer
Rest in peace russetiden 2020
Live in the mountains, and we literally drowned in cabin owners this weekend
Most seems to have gone home by now thankfully, but still quite a few here
The only thing that could’ve been even more unthinkable would be if people weren’t allowed to go skiing or go for walks in the forest/mountain
The problem is when you get sick
The small mountain towns don't have the capacity to take care of hundreds of extra corona patients
you’re supposed to isolate yourself at home
the reason cabin trips are banned is because the poorer capacity in those municipalities can’t handle mass influx
Modern cabins are more like small (and sometimes not so small) vacation homes, are built in so-called cabin fields, and are very close to roads
This irks me, because whenever someone says they're going to their cabin, I immideately think making food over a fire, playing board games, reading Donald pockets, hiking/skiing
When in reality they're going to sit still, watch their flat screen tv, cook in an oven, and generally have all the luxuries of home, minus the immideate access to a night life
Yes, except that some of those people will still get sick, and the small mountain towns don't have enough healthcare workers
I live in one of these places
When most people think of cabins you think of a remote are usually without water and electricity
That’s not the case in popular winter places in Norway
There’s hundreds upon hundreds of cabins right by each other, close to the ski slopes etc
My county usually has approx 4500 habitants
At the height of people staying at their cabins, we probably easily both triple and quadruple those numbers
Needless to say, we’re not prepared for that amount of people in a pandemic like this
Not to mention, you would still have to go by a store to get groceries for however long you plan to stay
So although it sounds like a good plan in theory, it most definitely is not
And it will affect the local population, a lot of whom are elderly
I wish the healthcare workers in those regions good luck, and have fun
On Sunday I really felt like standing by the road and waving them goodbye
"GOOD RIDDANCE
And welcome back next time " The roads were basically empty on Monday
Not really
I think we will have to go to the Balkans if we are going to start talking about countries I sometimes forget about in Europe
Or places like Andorra and Lichtenstein
Not at all
They are like our little brother and best friend
Not really, guees it’s beacuse we are both Nordic countries
No, I see Iceland as "family" and I've been there several times
After looking a bit at mbl
is, it seems like you get more news from us than we get from you (it's funny how understandable written Icelandic is to us, even it seems not at first sight)
Its more like we hear news from Iceland if it's relevant for norway, like fishery
Other than that, we hear something from your music sometimes
But in everyday life, Iceland is mentioned now and then if we need a country to compare with norway
I dont know
Fun fact: Clothes at Hennes & Maurits (H&M) here has price tag in NOK and ISK
Trains in Norway are pretty much non existent
I've taken more train in Germany than Norway
That would be pretty much all the trains we have, sadly
I hope build a lot more
It's so sad
Depends on my mood and the question in question really
I didn't look through it now for example
I did
I have seen a shift in the type of ads that are being played here
It is a lot more of [this] type of ads where they focus a lot more on education and children than just "poor, starving children". Also, I just love the shot of the girl on the big pile of garbage :)
Quite common
I hardly ever browse the internet without adblock and never intend to, but I've seen quite a few ads about it on TV (and I don't watch much TV)
Africa is obviously a pretty complicated place, but it has a tendency to get oversimplified, like almost anyone is likely to do when it comes to a part of the world that's not their own
Since this stuff is blared at people a lot, it makes sense for it to feature in people's idea of the place
Absolutely
In Norway there is a foundation called “Redd Barna” (save the children) that is all about helping out poor children, usually Africans
There are lots of others as well, and on holidays the only commercials on TV are for foundations that help out others
So for example on December 25th you can get 2 or 3 ads for saving African children per commercial break
Yes, these days the sales pitch is to educate them out of poverty
Which ultimately will mean that people in the aid industrial complex will be out of jobs
So who knows what's *really* going on
Stool - it’s so similar to the Norwegian word for chair “stol” and the way they pronounce it makes it sound like they are trying to pronounce a foreign word
Idk but the word makes me uncomfortable
«You» for both singular and plural
I thought, no way that doesn’t confuse people
I’ve learned to read into the situation since then
Also, the word shirt sounded like the norwegian word for skirt, while the word skirt sounded like the norwegian word for shirt
The first time I heard someone called a puppy a "pupper" I kind of just stood there like "wh-what
I thought there’s no way that’s actually a word that is being used because it sounds stupid as hell
It also means boobs in norwegian, and telling them that was real fun
I saw a Mexican getting hated on(on Twitter by Americans)for naming her black dog Negro, which has no bad meaning in Spanish
But still they called her racist and all kinds of stuff
Edit: typos
The pronunciation of the word makes me uncomfortable, it’s completely irrational, but still makes me uncomfortable
Change it around
If the English word for feaces was chair, you would think saying human chair was a bit strange
In OP's language, chair only means chair
In the way that the pronunciation of a word(not the meaning) shouldn’t make you uncomfortable, and make you avoid saying it
Not that it’s a part of my every day vocabulary, but still
Isn't that what a butler is
Or is butler just for private households
I think we used to get them at home
We always had the new catalogue and it's frequently look through it and dream about how I'd set up my new home
I haven't gotten any since moving out though
Its 10 here and normally we would have had snow already
Only among some very old people who still hold grunges from the war
Maybe a few old people that remember the war, but generally there is no hostility towards Germans
Nowadays, no
Obviously some here will hate Germany for many reasons even to this day, that is common in every country I guess
But during WW2, there definitely was anti-German sentiment because of Nazi Germany taking over Norway
Not after ww2 but because you can't drive on our roads
You get me
I can't speak for the rest of the Nordics, but conflict aversion through polite language is definitely a thing in Norway
Being direct and unable to read social cues can be seen as rude
These comments are too much for me
My life is s lie
I need to lie down
Clothing brand Napapijri use the Norwegian flag as a logo, but it is an Italian brand
yeah I found out about this as an adult
Spar means Save, as in save money, so I always thought it was Norwegian
But then I learned spar is the name of the tree in Dutch lol
The other irony is that in Norwegian "Dass" is common (but not polite) word for the loo
So they are trying to sell "Toilet Ice Cream". Clever
I always thought it was danish for the same reason
SAME
I was shocked when I saw a Spar in Spain
Its a combination of the founders name and hometown **I**ngvard **K**amprad from **E**lmtaryd, **A**gunnaryd
Scandinavia is cold and ice cream is cold
I guess that's probably it
Denmark is the least cold, but internally in Scandinavia at least they're known for being the biggest food lovers
Wait what that is a tree in the logo
I feel so dumb i just thought it was a random symbol
It's working well enough that you will probably not find a single European wanting to change to a US type health care system
(At least I have never encountered anyone
) I shared this with someone else yesterday:
My son has been to the hospital 6 times since July last year
That includes 5 ambulances, 1 ambulance helicopter, 1 surgery, 1 MRI, 1 CT, 2 EEG, blood tests and other tests, 3 types of medicine, and follow up appointments at the hospital
Every time he stayed at the hospital I got to stay there with him, and we shared room (which had its own bathroom) with no one, and we had a kitchen down the hall where we could get food if we got hungry outside meals
Out of pocket cost for all of it: $0
And here no one pays more than $227 in out of pocket cost per person per year (for adult, as there are no out of pocket cost at all for children)
Anything above that the government will cover
That includes travel cost to a hospital further away (for instance if I have to go and see a specialist at a hospital in the capital)
So I'm not able to see any advantage at all having a US type private insurance compared to my government health care coverage
Universal healthcare would be a good thing for the US
Your health is one of the most important things in life and the US is rich enough to provide good care for everyone
But M4A seems like bad way of getting there
I would focus more on addressing the specific shortcommings of the current system than do such a drastic reform
Healthcare is a huge part of the economy and you just dont turn that upside down without causing any damage
And the US health care system is for the most part really good
Norway here, works out well
I'd say we pay about $25 for most regular doctor and hospital stuff (doctor visit, x-ray, medicines, etc) up to a yearly deductible of around $260
After that it's all free
For children, everything is always free
One exception is dental care, though
For some reason this seems to be the case for most European countries
We pay a lot for dental stuff
Still free for kids though
Waiting times aren't bad here
My doctor always has time to see me, although not usually the same day
If you go to the public ER you'll be put in a queue depending on how severe the nurses think your situation is, so if you're an anxious first time parent with a kid who cries constantly and won't sleep, you'll probably have to wait a while before the kid gives a massive fart and falls asleep in the waiting room
(Why yes, that is a personal experience
) I've never had any problems with waiting times though
Taxes are hard and I don't know too much about how it works
I pay 34% in income tax myself
Then there's obviously VAT and stuff too
I think 16
6% of all taxes in our country goes towards health care
38% (or so) of our BNP is taxes, but apparently those numbers are hard to compare with other countries depending on whether social service is taxed or not, etc
I dunno
I have no idea whether it would be a bad idea for the US - I don't really know how it works over there apart from some reddit anecdotes
But, you know, anecdotally, I have two kids and hang out at parenting subs
Americans always say that having kids is expensive, and how daycare is so expensive that it often makes sense for one parent to just forego a career to take care of the kid instead, etc
When I learned that giving birth costs money, though, that sounded even crazier
Numbers are numbers, and they're kinda artificial I guess
Yes, I pay a bunch in taxes, but so does everyone else, so our wages are fairly high I think
I mostly hear from tourists that everything is so expensive in Norway, but it's all relative I guess
Numbers aside, it feels good to not have to worry about health stuff
I was hit by a bus a few years ago, an ambulance drove me to the ER, I got checked out, then I could go home
I have asthma, that's all cool
Our kids were delivered for free and they get vaccines for free
My grandma needed a new hip last year, that got done
Contraceptives are free, and abortions are also free
And of course my employer doesn't have anything to do with my health insurance, and there's no "out of network" doctors, but we still have private doctors and hospitals if we want those for some reason (ie
if we're rich, I guess)
> It meant he wasn't eligible for NHS care
If he'd come home and paid his taxes, he'd now still have a house and a yacht, although maybe not as big as the ones he had and lost in the US
That's the thing
Americans living in the US (or Saudi Arabia) earn lots of money
But it's more risky as out of pocket cost can amount to astronomical amounts in the US
Living in Norway I don't have to worry about future health care cost, future care for my parents, future university cost for my children
Only larger expenses I might encounter are buying a new car and maybe fixing the roof on my house
That's it
The rest is covered
> and I have complete peace of mind about medical problems, accidents, or emergencies
That's the main thing
You pay taxes according to your level of income - and that's it
No need to give cost another thought
I can only start to imagine the stress-levels in parents in the US
One thing is not going to the doctor yourself because of cost, but not being able to afford taking your child there is a whole other level or anxiety
The funny thing is that he is less radical than the average Europan politician
Only Americans view him as "extreme".
> It costs the taxpayer more
Not necessarily
Every tax payer in the US is already helping pay for more than 30% of the population's health care (medicare, medicaid, prison health care, millitary health care, ER cost not paid by patients
On top of that they are paying for their own health care insurance and out of pocket cost - at excruciatingly high prices
So if the government get the prices down (as every government is already doing in Europe, I believe the over all cost per taxpayer will go down
And so it should be
Stupid people will always exist
No reason to deny them health care
In the US you still have to pay, even if another person was the stupid one
Lets say a drunk driver drives into your car and you are the only one to end up in hospital
The drunk driver pays nothing, but you pay thousands of dollars in out of pocket cost
The ambulance alone cost you $500-1000 over there
In Norway prices are negotiated on government level
The US can do the same
Do all workers in the US get health insurance though their job
If they don't I'm unsure what your point is
> It's "I'm fine, I'm not paying for everyone else".
The sad thing is that he is completely wrong
Becasue he helps pay for:
- prisoner's healthcare [(2,2 million citizens and non-citizens)]
- soldier's health care [(12,8 million citizens)]
- people receiving medicare [(44,3 million citizens)]
- people receiving medicaid [(48,6 million citizens)]
- People without insurance visiting an emergency room (costing the US government [$40 billion] a year)
So he helps pay for 108 million US citizen's health care
(ER costs not included)
That is **33%** of the US population
It's obviously a huge change
And the health industry will fight against it with all they got
So I'm not convinced that things will ever change, even if they need a change badly
Only times i don’t drink tap water is when I am out of the country
Never been anywhere that has as good tap water as Norway(except maybe Sweden), and it’s always a delight coming home from travel and you can grab yourself a glass of cold delicious water straight from the tap
Belgium and Spain had in particular bad water(Brussels, Ghent and Malaga and Barcelona)
France had mixed(Paris had horrific water, but Gaillac/Toulouse had decent water)
Denmark too has bad water
Sweden has about same quality as Norway
London water is 4/10 and Berlin water is 5/10
I added city locations as water quality in my experience has to do with how close you are to mountains, as mountain water is in my opinion the best water
Also where you find the most fresh water
That is what I drink 99% of the time
Either cold straight from the tap
Or by making coffee or tea with it
On **very** rare occasions I will drink other things
(Norway) Yes and we also bottle up tap water and sell to other countries like boss water, but when I bought it in Germany once it tasted like shit I don’t what had happened, if it had gotten a bad tast from tha plastic bottle or something ells
Only reason I'd buy bottled water would be at airports
There was this trend a few years ago where people would buy "Voss vann", so much so that they came out with a glass bottle with it that got stupidly popular (yes, people would buy bottled water on a glass bottle) all because of the name and look of the bottle I assume
The water isn’t even from the town Voss, and have nothing to do with the town at all as far as I know
Not to mention that it can be upwards of ten times as expensive as normal bottled water
Sparkling water just reminds me of the immeasureable dissapointment of buying it accidentally instead of regular water when on vacation and it's hot
I actually drink all my water from the toilet
I just stick a drinking straw into there and go to town
The fridge one is quite common, but considered fancy and extravagant imo
A brita pitcher I never saw before
I know what they are and have seen both, but they're not common here and I've never owned or used either
Fridges that dispense ice cubes are an upper middle class thing I think, and I guess they probably dispense water too, but I'm not sure what the need would be for that
Tap water is plenty cold enough
Many people do and many people don't. My fridge has a water dispenser and a ice maker
Hmmm
Really
I've heard it can smell quite a lot because of the sulphur though
Is that not the case
I’ve experienced it once in my life so far, so it’s fairly rare I’d say
But I assume it may vary a bit from place to place
Yeah the water is from Iveland in Agder
It’s not even close
Their whole thing was literally to market themselves as luxury water, even though it’s just as good as any other water in Norway
Nothing special about it what so ever
I teach high school in a high-income area
I regularly see students refilling "Voss" bottles at the sinks in the hallways
It's all about the fancy bottle
It doesnt really claim to be related to Voss tho
They call their source Voss, and lots of places share names
But yeah the water is honestly just regular water in a fancy bottle
That Could very much be the case
Our tap water sure is not best
Many places around both vestfold and viken have so much chlorine added
Barely drinkable
I see
Thanks
Quite often now - I study in English (spoken and written assignments) and use English a lot for work
The more I use both Norwegian and English throughout a day, the more confused my brain get haha
I tend to forget phrases in Norwegian, and simple, specific words in English
Way too often
I spent most of the teenage years and 20s playing games online, constantly talking in English, so there's that
And English is way more forgiving because it's so versatile ('versatile' is not a word I would remember in Norwegian, for example)
Hah, every day it feels like
It's probably often because I've read about a subject online, which usually is in english
Yes, this is it
My brain does not want to make it easy for me
Talking to or approaching strangers is only ok if you're hiking
Walk inside peoples house with your shoes on
Its clear to most that Scotland and Northern Ireland are not the same as England
But Wales on the other hand
I suspect lots of people outside UK are not aware that it's a separate country
I would even claim that most don't know they have a separate language
Unsure why this is thought
I met a Irish bachelor party and asked where in Scotland they were from
It escalated very quickly
Same thing here
That american "how you doing"-shit is provocative
My ex always used ketchup
Yeah
I think if I saw a Norwegian walk past the entrance room with shoes on I would deem them insane
There is no good reason for that
The personal space thing is the same in Norway
Yesterday I walked past my building's janitor (he has worked there for a couple of years) and I nodded as to say hi when I passed him
I could see the instant panic and confusion in his eyes
I will not be doing that again
I would have thought Polands time as a part of the eastern bloc is more touchy
Remember visiting Poland with my friend and his mother getting all patriotic when recalling the protests for independence
I had a lovely conversation about the war over a couple of beers at the bar in a swingersclub in Berlin
He couldn't have been that upset
He was still up for a threesome
Is «De/Dem» still used in DK or are you all «dus» like we’ve been in Norway the last 50 years
When I was a child everyone called you Holland
But I have no idea why
In some countries the official name for the Netherlands is Holland
Tbh Turkey seems so multicultural and all over the place I don't know what to believe about it
Like is it very religious or super non-religious, is it hot or cold, is it Arabic speaking or Kurdish or Turkish or whatever (I know there are many more languages in Turkey just the ones that came at the top of my head), is it Asian or European etc
would I be popular for mentioning ETA
> In the capital city of Bratislava – dont talk shit about the city
I was there once for a business trip
I actually enjoyed my stay
It was autumn and chilly and I was pregnant on top of that, so I feasted on all the good, hearty food there
Just don't act like an ass because they didn't greet you
Damn
Oh yeah let me stink up the bathroom
This is the most German thing I have ever read
In Norway people dont use houseshoes in their homes, maybe in their workplaces though
I think some things are different on the country side
I'm often greeted by both the janitor at my children's school, and the bus drivers
But I once tried to greet a bus driver in the city
I said "good morning" and he got that confused look you described
So now I keep my greeting to the countryside
(But I wouldn't dream of greeting the other people waiting for the bus
They are on their own)
as a norwegian i don’t really agree
I think people just refer to the eastern bloc countries, excluding east germany, as eastern europe
It’s almost as if their land touches their land
People don't do that
What
> just never ever mentioned anywhere in the media
Wales in general is not mentioned in the media
Except for "The Prince of Wales" now and again
Sometimes you rewrite a sentence a couple of times and then it turns into a cross between them
This was one of those times
It would be considered kind of rude not to
No one wants to see your hairy feet
I live in the city, but have spent enough time of my life on the countryside too, and you described it very well from my experience too
I do actually feel we could be *a bit* more open to such exchanges, just because it's nice
Don't get me wrong, I'm very Norwegian in my views of not talking to people, staying far away from most people etc
But some more hellos and thank yous would be nice
And we would be better at welcoming immigrants
What I do sometimes is instead of saying hello or good morning to the bus driver, I say thank you as I rush out the door
That way I express my appreciation, and none of us has to deal with the other, because I'm gone anyway
Well, this is not really "possible" now since I can't walk out at the front and that's the only time I feel brave enough to say thank you lol
It partly collective shyness in a way
It is sort of polite to leave each other alone and avoid creating awkward situations
If I don't say hello to you and bother you, you don't have to say hello to me
In every situation
I'll take a look, thanks
I mentioned Arabic because I had a teacher in sociolinguistics from Turkey and he spoke (among other languages) Arabic, so I assumed a certain amount of people in Turkey spoke Arabic (that and I double checked wiki and it said Arabic is spoken in Turkey :P)
I want to
Because I'll be able to drink a beer with my dinner haha
I did buy a few bottles of local/Slovakian wine to take home with me, to drink after the baby was born
I was very impressed with it
Is he a [pagan]
You guys don't have heated flooring and vacuum every week, or
I had a lot of microbrews the last time I was in Prague
I usually look for the smaller breweries everywhere I go
The wine I had was definitely premium
I know my husband wrote down the name somewhere, so I'll have to look for it again
What’s a fun statistic in which your country comes in last
I’ll start:
Norway has finished bottom of the table in the Eurovision Song Contest more times than any other contender in its history
That surprises me
I went to Slovakia once ans found your people very friendly
But then again, I’ve met the sweetest, kindest grandparents that dislike certain races
Poland
Wouldn’t have guessed it
Think I read somewhere that a lot of people travel to Poland for hunting
Guess I thought you’d have many hunting rifles
What annoys me is when british people (including official commentators and reporters for the broadcast) blame the UK’s performance on bloc voting
Like, even the most bloc voting regions like the balkans, baltics, central europe and scandinavia only have like four countries in it tops
You have Ireland and Australia voting for you so you’re actually above average when it comes to stuff like that
Countries like Albania and Armenia however can only really rely on their own diaspora, yet your last commentator I remember acted salty, saying stuff like "well of course, isn’t that typical" when Albania (again, not part of any bloc) got like 8 points from another balkan country
Is it because all your energy is diverted towards fellow balkan people, so you have none left for other ethnicities
Lmao
That’s really great
Keep going
They are only here to sell us fine and cheap weissbier
This thread turned out a bit more depressing that intended
I do appreciate though, how people are willing to admit their country isn’t perfect
No, we're quite amiable about it
I even let my friend bring his swedish girlfriend around when we celebrate the 17th of May
If OP had this happen in the middle east, the grandsons would retaliate
There is stupid shit like inherent grudge that keeps the wars going
One of my best friends are German
We joke a lot about nazis and ww1 and 2
It's always in good spirit and he can always find something to mock the Norwegians
Nah
To be fair I have never really talked to any Germans about the Nazi-occupation of Norway, but I would certainly not be awkward about it
It happened a long time ago
Otherwise I guess we haven't been the baddies that often
Even though we treated Samer quite poorly, and going back to the Viking Age we did a lot of pillaging
That is however thousand of years ago, and it is impossible to relate to
I do not really think people of York will be get all awkward if I mentioned the Vikings
Nah, still enjoying holidays in both Sweden and Denmark
No awkwardness
7 June should be the more awkward day to invite your Swedish friends for a party
If you think about it, 17 May would be celebration for swedes as it kinda the day they got Norway from Denmark
My great grandfather bombed Norwegian civilians with christmas presents
(Tobacco, coffee, chocolate, letters from the royal family and government)
Can be proud of that, yes
Not really
17th of May 1814 was the day that the Constitution was signed, stating that the Realm was a free, independent and undividable kingdom
It was an act of rebellion against the Treaty of Kiel, and ended with war with Sweden
The war was lost in August 1814 and resulted in the Convention of Moss which laid the basis for the personal union between Norway and Sweden and the November Constitution which stated that *" Kongeriget Norge er et frit, selvstændigt, udeleligt og uafhændeligt Rige, forenet med Sverrige under een Konge
"  -* basically that the Kingdom of Norway was a free, undividable and undisposable Realm, united with Sweden under one rule
Sweden didn't get Norway at all
The King of Sweden became King of Norway, but the two kingdoms were never incorporated into a single realm
Norway kept it's parliament, it's laws and it's government
The basis for the personal union was established in the Treaty of Kiel from January 1814, and affirmed 4th of November the same year
17th of May was not the date related to anything Swedish at all
17th of May celebrations was actually banned from 1815 to 1829, which formed much of the drive behind the way Norway celebrates its constitution day
That would be the [14th of January] or more appropriately the [14 of August]
The native Americans are coming
>And we quite like 17 May
Glad we can show you what a proper national celebration should be like
He was a pragmatic conqueror, with less regard for human life than most of us
Still not out of his way 'wants people tp die' like Hitler and such
Not seen as 'the baddie' in Norway either
Or, slightly baddie
Denmark-Norway was allied with him, and the British at the time are remembered a lot less favourably than Napoleon, what with the famine they caused
A lot of old people in Norway go to spain on holidays, so there's gotta be something which is good for them there
Weather is a factor, and stress is probably another and fysical fitness is probably the last
I got arthrithis and I can assure you, you're joint do work better in warmer climates + you get better sun/d vitamin that way
Wheather have an impact on your mood, winterdepression is a thing, tho more relevant the further north you go
Loneliness is also a thing, kills about as well as smoking or worse
I also think it's easier to be physically active when the weather is good, and that makes your health better i bet
~~Stress from office jobs is probably a bit worse in northern countries tho I don't know
I have read that life expectancy is more correlated to diet than quality of healthcare
Also the climate down there sure looks fine
It's called sunshine and a weaker currency up against Norwegian crowns

We have [russefeiring]
Norway: Hold my beer
In Norway we party for a month
We basically just say fuck the exam by partying for almost 3 weeks and barely showing up to school consciously
[This] comes to mind
It's supposed to be a serious scene, but for Norwegians it's just funny
His Norwegian isn't terrible (in that it's understandable), but he's clearly not a native speaker
But most importantly, even if the English education for someone who's in his 20s/30s in 1982 perhaps wasn't as good as it is today, you can be damn sure he could speak English if he was part of a scientific team in Antarctica, so it makes absolutely no sense having him speak Norwegian to someone he hasn't met before
In other words, you have a foreigner speaking Norwegian in a situation where a Norwegian would speak English
Every viking based show always does that generic Scandinavian accent like Vikings and the last kingdom
Annoying thing is for the most part they are actually really good, there’s just always a couple that are off
In Captian America: The First Avenger, when that one guy who was watching over the Tesseract tried to speak Norwegian
The sound quality was a little bad, but I could legit not even make out half of what he said, the first came off as mumbeling and the rest was something like 'Let them come'?
In one TV series a person was supposed to be Norwegian, but he spoke Swedish
So that was interesting
The actor was a German named Norbert Weisser - why they couldn't get a native speaker to play  the part or simply redub the few lines spoken by the character I don't know
Also, referring to the creature disguised as a dog as a "ting" is a very strange word choice
A native speaker would only use it for inanimate objects, "beist" or "udyr" seems more appropriate here
My mind immediately went for [this]
Short, but I have never forgotten it
I haven't seen that one before
That's hilarious
And the guy is just named "Trondheim". That's like having an American character named "Oklahoma City".
Oh boy that was terrible
I had to read the subtitles most of the time to understand it
Ouch
That was bad
I couldn't even make it through the whole thing
Disagree
Calling a dog a beast doesn’t really convey the point that it is some_thing_ way worse (some people call normal dogs beasts), and when an entity is unknown it is not really that uncommon to use object form in Norwegian
Haha, "skaahlløh". She's even correcting the guy who says it more correct than her
Just checked out the cut scenes, and the two women do indeed speak Norwegian
West and east dialects
Well, yes
Since they used Norwegian actors
Hivju from Game of Thrones being one of them
Haha I managed to push through as anything viking related gives me a massive bonor but for sure some of those accents sound straight up Turkish Australian Spanish, literally pick any country and add a Welsh singing syntax and you have American Scandinavian
Nah
That's an actual name
That definitely happens
You grow up one place, move to another place and have kids
My mother speaks an eastern Norwegian dialect, I speak a western one
'Spot the swede'- not that hard
They blond, blue and always trying to pull on a push door
Yes
That's the rare time we *do* say hello to strangers
Yes, hiking in the woods or mountains is the only time it's socially accepted (and expected) to randomly greet strangers
Imagine hiking alone far out in nowhere
Then you meet this one person
You say hi, but they don't even look at you while walking past you
I would be kind of scared for the rest of my hike
Came here to say this
I also say hi to someone I meet on the forest route here in my neighbourhood
Kind of odd passing each other on a very narrow path and pretend the other person is not there
So we say hi and continue on our merry way
Unless it's one of the super popular hikes (like Preikestolen) where you'd have to say "hi" constantly
> we kinda just say hello to everyone all the time
You say hi to STRANGERS
You scary Irish people
I guess you usually just drive up
Is it really so formal in austria
I would not approach doctors or old ladies differently than other people
Maybe norwegian is an informal language
Also came here to say this
Foreigners who move to Norway often feel like we never greet each other
But then they start hiking or skiing and suddenly they are greeted by everyone
There is usually someone writing about this in the newspaper about once a year under titles that are along the lines of: "I have lived here for 10 years, first now did I discover the Norwegians secret"
You scary person
Nope
Not unless you know them
Yeah, it's not like we are impolite, we just tend to choose our greeting locations more carefully
For you to be able to pretend you would still have to be aware of their whereabouts
I use this trick all the time
If I meet an acquaintance in the shop, which I know too well to just say hello to, but don't have time/energy to both greet and talk to, I pretend I dont see them
Most often they will do the same
(If they say hi and want to talk I obviously do the polite thing and have a small conversation with them)
Let us know how the visit turned out
I had no idea northern Italians were closet Scandinavians
;) How interesting
Would you say northern Italians are similar to Swiss people
> "Forbidden the entry to dogs and southerners"
If it's any consolation we did the same - it could be very difficult for someone from northern Norway to find someone who were willing to rent out an apartment to them in Oslo
They simply had a bad reputation in spite of most of them being very decent people
Now I somewhat regret only visiting Venice and Rome back when I went to Italy
I should have visited Milan as well
Oh well, next time
Edit: I meant Norway, not Italy
Fixed it now
> You should visit also the smallest town
Pescara, Assisi, Scilla, Verona, Siena, the northern Lakes and many others
In this way you will experience the real Italy
Thanks
It's always a good idea to talk to the locals to find the best spots
>  I'll be doing a week in Sweden next year as exchange student, but only because Norway was not available, I would totally have chosen Norway
So close
But I think you will have a great time i Sweden
Lets hope corona is completely gone by then
Unisex dorms in the military
When I was in the military we used to be around quite a lot of germans and they just couldn't grasp the idea of unisex dorms, they had so many questions about it and honestly came across as a kinda pervert, they wondered if we would constantly screw each other just because we lived in the same dorm
Apparently in Germany they didn't even have male and female soldiers in the same buildings
I've also heard it's not a thing in the US
I'm not even sure if any countries have unisex dorms like we do
Here it's just natural, no questions asked
Calling everyone and anyone by their first name; the teacher, the doctor, the judge, the professor, the chief of police, the prime minister
> For instance, films and TV shows in Poland have neither subtitles nor dubbing, instead we have one guy reading the script out loud as the movie goes
Like a poor man's version of dubbing with one guy reading all the lines in a monotone voice, I haven't seen anything like that anywhere else abroad
On the day of Christmas Eve in Norway, the TV channel NRK airs a version of Three Wishes for Cinderella with that type of dubbing (though not monotone)
It's a highly cherished piece of film and people protest loudly whenever they even mention changing it to a "proper" dub
Watching the one-man dubbed Cinderella is one of my most beloved Christmas traditions
So I assume most homes have a bath tub
Here most apartments only have a shower
One Christmas movie is like that in Norway
> Weekly strikes
I thought they were daily
I've done winter camping and must say that I sleep much better when I sleep outside in the cold
I really need to find a way to market adult sized prams with those wool-lined sleeping bags inside
We cook pasta ALL THE WAY THROUGH
EVERY time
The King is still "His Majesty" though
We gotta draw the line somewhere
I wouldn't say it's a national pasttime, but you wouldn't really at an eye at it either
We prefer [these ones] (Keeps the kids dry)
I had no idea
So no alcohol at the tables outside an restaurant
Or are all tables always places inside
I actually bought the [black Pete game] for someone for Christmas
That is what I thought of when reading the OP
I would never see this movie without the one-man dubbing
Nice christmas morning tradition
You gotta go to Japan some time
Their queueuing makes Britain look like a bunch of pre-civilization anarchistic savages
They'll queue to get on an escalator
They'll form a perfect line for the subway long before the train arrives
Stores have markings on the floor so you can tell where the line should go if a thousand people show up to shop at once
They are queue connoisseurs
This was last year, so yeah should be pretty updated info
That was what they said about the base they were stationed in though, completley seperate buildings for males and females
I guess it's different from base to base, and also on what battalion/corps/company/troop you're in
Unisex showers, that's next level
We didn't even have that, but if you're out in the field you may have to swim completley naked with all your fellow soldiers
I remember there was some controversy when a story surfaced some years ago when a single girl had to swim naked with 30 guys(she was the only girl in the platoon) when their sergeants commanded them to do it
Constantly is probably a stretch
But of course it happened with 18-20 year olds alone and living together for the first time
I was in the army though which is pretty male dominated, our exact men-female ratio changed frequently but for the most part we would have 45-50 guys and 5-6 girls max where I was stationed
A few will always have boyfriends so your left with a ton of thirsty guys and just a few girls
I didn't do anything more than sleeping in the same bed but of course there were a few guys who got the full package and other favours
I wouldn't say living together was the main reason behind this though
Seeing as you usually live with multiple people your not really going to be able to fuck in your own room
And it was generally people who didn't live in the same room to begin with
The Air Force and especially Navy are much closer in men-female ratio from what I've heard
So I'd assume there as a lot more action going on there
True, although most people will say Kong Harald when talking *about* him
Outside the Nordic, yes
Yeah it does
Medical data shows that while British Pakistanis were responsible for only 3% of all births in Britain, they accounted for **30 percent** of British children born with a genetic illness
Guess why
Source:
You hug female friends and handshake male friends
Unless they're very good male friends then you gotta hug them too
Here in Norway I guess
I remember I got scolded by a female friend once for shaking her hand when I met her
Next time I met her I did better and my girlfriend scolded me
Sometimes in life you can not win

The punishment for loosing is to look like a chimney sweeper, with soot on their nose

Not a country, but we have the expression "helt Texas" (completely Texas), meaning "going off the hinges/devolve into chaos". Not necessarily in a bad way
If a party takes off, you can say "festen var helt Texas" (the party was completely Texas)
That probably means the clean-up is not going to be fun the next day
To take/do a Spanish one means to do something unordenly, f.ex
to take figurative shortcuts, or to tell a small lie
The Swedish method is to do something idiot-proof, f.ex
shutting down a machine by pulling the cord out
Few I can think of, some are a bit old,
ta en spansk en (do a spanish) is to take short cuts, do something cheeky and unorthodox
Svenskemetoden, the Swedish method, something idiot proof like unplugging a pc
Det var helt texas, it was like texas, to indicate something was hectic, crazy and over the top
Du store kineser, 'great Chinese
An expression of something surprising,
Klondike stemming, 'klondike vibes', used to express sudden financial growth / prosperity
We also use Greek to me directly translated,
Polsk riksdag, a polish government meeting / session, something loud, disorganised, shouting screaming etc
Remarkable how many are casually racist but there you go
Angry as a Turk - angry
Russian roulette - you know
To do a Spanish - to do something a little recklessly, not by the book
Norwegian arms - to reach over the dinner table to get something (considered bad manners)
French opening - an opening between the legs in feminine clothing
Swedish conditions - can refer to several things, all bad
Completely Texas - chaotic, lawless
"Sorry about my Swedish manners" = stretching your arm past a person at the table to reach something
The funniest one is "Du store kineser" which means kind of means "You big chinese(person)". Doesn't really translate well, though
Many also call it “svenskeknappen” (the Swedish button) when you use the on/off button on your machine to force it to shut down
How do you say the town in Russia thing in Danish
Doesn't it specifically refer to trapping someone *in* your dutch oven
As in, you fart under the doona, then throw it over your mate/partners head
Yeah
Haven’t really heard that expression since the 90’s luckily
That’s an oddly specific thing to have an expression for if no one is actually doing it
I consulted on o'mighty google, seems its the actual act of farting and trapping someone under
Edit: apparently Samsung disapproves of the word 'farting' and changed it to farming
I think it used to be more common
Me either, but I've been the victim of one or two
Australian girls are just as filthy as the boys, my friend in high school used to think it was hilarious (I'm half Australian, tried putting two badges on, but it didn't let me)
People were already afraid of immigrants "stealing" their jobs
Wonder how it will look when people actually want these jobs
At least the virus didn't come with migrants, that would have been a shit show
Man, that takes me back to when Romania joined the the EU
Suddenly the Polish were no longer thieves
It's the Roma
The Polish were just regular people like you and me all along
It's the Roma you gotta watch out for
Look I'm not going to comment on whether Roma are thieves or not, I really don't have any statistics on that
The point is that the fears about the old group of immigrants seems to disappear whenever there's a new wave
Before people were afraid of Polish immigrants they were afraid of the Pakistani
When I was in university I lived in an international student housing
I only encountered about 4 other Norwegians there that year
One day I was doing laundry in the basement and there were two guys talking to eachother
I could not figure out what language they spoke, it just got weirder and weirder the more I listened
Slowly I realized it was norwegian, so I walked over and asked where they were from
Turns out they spoke my dialect, from my own area
I expected a foreign language, and my brain tried its best to give it to me
(Happens all the time when I listen to music and I don't expect it to be a Nordic language
In the second movie «the thing». I wasn’t prepared for Norwegian, and something about his accent made me not understand anything he was saying
It was only after turning on subtitles I could understand it
Norwegian here
Some dialects are legitimately just hard to comprehend
One of my exes was American and when she came to visit the second time she had asked me how to say "It's good to be home again" in Norwegian so she could greet my parents
Even though she said it perfectly, neither my mom or dad understood what she was trying to say because their brains were wired to expect English from her, so they thought she was saying something they didnt understand in English
This subreddit is basically Norway in a nutshell
For every valley or fjord there is a different dialect
Poor foreigners that try to learn Norwegian have to decide if they want to learn bokmål or nynorsk - those are the official written languages
What nobody tells them is that no-one speaks like that, they are written languages and there is ten thousand dialects with different words and pronounciation in spoken Norwegian, so there are plenty of local dialects even natives don't understand
In the 80ies, Norway used to have a Saturday night tv show consisting of some random person saying a few sentences and linguistic experts pinpointing what village they were from
And they could narrow it down to villages with a population of a few hundreds
This happens to me as well
If I don't recognize the language, it's like my brain doesn't know what dictionary to use and it all sounds like familiar gibberish
Then as soon as I twig that they're actually speaking Norwegian (or English), suddenly I understand everything
Latest offender: Umbrella Academy on Netflix
Lol, I love how the native text in the video calls it "the shire"
I had a hard time with dialects in Innlandet when I moved here, but it's getting better
But there seems to be families/communities/areas all over the "fjøl" that mumbles more than others
I've encountered some in the north and some in the middle
I still don't understand my grandfather-in-law even after 7 years
I sometimes need my own stepfather to translate to different vocabulary because he is from a tiny place outside of the city (but same county)
Some dialects are difficult to understand and will use completely unintelligible words and very different pronunciations, but talk to enough people/watch enough Norwegian tv and you will eventually gain somewhat of an understanding of most dialects
Its the rural ones that tend to be most difficult, because of the isolation
> Latest offender: Umbrella Academy on Netflix
Came here to say this
Without subtitles I would have had no idea what they were trying to say
She wasn’t, but the “Swedes” were
«I Kassa på Rema», the cashier in one of the large supermarket chains
Usually you hear «kassa på Kiwi/Rema/etc
Kiwi and Rema are cheap supermarket chains, so basically it means if you don’t study you will en up working behind the till at one of these places
McDonald's and grocery store are the ones I have heard the most
They say that if you don't study well, you will end up working at McDonalds
You will become a naver, someone who lives of the state's "trust fund", the tax money
There is no lower status
It used to be Rimi
My Sister did an exchange year in US, St Louis,  was asked if we ride polar bears
Because of the golden compass
My mum was on holiday in Florida and they asked her if the troll documentary was real (trollhunter movie)
Gotta love em
That our islands have more than 4 houses each, so yes - they do have shops, banks, schools, and everything else you will find in the average town
Which greatly surprised an elderly lady visiting from South Africa
She also asked us about every speck of snow on mountain tops we saw if it was a glacier
In the end we just said yes to stop her asking
That everyone is rich
I had several people thinking everybody was rich in Norway
The country itself has a lot of money, the people are average
We dont have polar bears walking around in our streets
Americans think Norway is a socialist country
Is not, never has been
It is capitalism with a large welfare state
"The midnight sun" is the same sun you see in the sky where you live
You never hear about the mid day moon, but if there is midnight sun in the summer, that place will have no sun in the winter
For months
Don't plan on hiking or camping in the off season unless you are drilled in winter survival in darkness
If we had vikings living in reservations
And no, you cant go trollhunting, we do not offer polarbear rides to tourists, no there isnt a reindeer rental and islands are connected to the mainland, by boat, bridge or tunnel, and some of us dont work in the fish sector
Had to explain to a turist that yes, this city is made of 11 islands, no, you dont need to rent a boat to travel, you can indeed get places on foot, if you look down you will se a bridge
That you are standing on
That connects
Two islands
Without the need of a fucking boat
As is the funcion of a bridge
She didnt believe me
Obligatory kamelåså
It was not in Finland exactly, but [in 1953 one of them made it ashore] some 60 km from the border
Of course, that was an exceptional event
That made me laugh out loud
Thank you
So 6000 kr per month is rich
I'm like a millionaire then
You've got to take into consideration that stuff is expensive
You have caribou
No, they are not fatty at all, just like any animal with hooves
More tasty than beef, less gamey flavour than moose
Fat content probably somewhere between beef and the much leaner moose
It is the fur that keeps them warm
Every hair is hollow with air inside, which make them extremely insulating
I'm all for it
Some people treat this as a sort of moral dilemma, but I just don't see it
We make wearing seatbelts mandatory, we forbid speeding and drunk driving - why shouldn't we legislate against endangering yourself and others with infectious diseases
When it comes to children (who are usually the recipients of vaccinations), the question just becomes ridiculous
To allow people to risk their children's health because of superstition is worse than allowing them to beat them
I'm asthmatic too but I have never considered getting the flu vaccine
Have you ever had any side effects from it
Bruce Willis has a line in Pulp Fiction that goes "It's not a motorcycle, it's a chopper, baby
" In the Norwegian cinematic version, it was texted (in Norwegian)  as "It's not a motorcycle, it's a helicopter, baby
Keep in mind, he is sitting on said chopper while delivering the line, so you'd think it would have been pretty easy to see that something wasn't quite right
"Make up sex" became sminkesex, sminke meaning the Norwegian word for makeup
That's the one I can think of, off the top of my head, but there are plenty more
In my English textbook from middle school it mentioned that a ski jumping commentator translated «Han tok av med en enorm fart» as
he took of with a tremendous fart
While a very funny story, is it just me or is it kind of weird for a translator to have automatic emails in just one of the languages he translates to/from
In Norway there's a comedy movie called "Detektiv Downs" which is about a detective with down syndrome
He used to be known as Lynvingen in Norwegian (meaning The Lightning Wing)
Does that mean you can finally change your national anthem to the one you were destined to have
On topic, no, I didnt know
How good of news is this
Is the russian language really discriminated against
In Astana and Almaty I never heard people speak Kazakh
All the bars played russian music, every restaurant menu was in russian
I know this does not show the whole picture, but it hardly seems like a language which is discriminated
28-30 degrees celsius now for the past couple weeks
I'm nearly dying
It's nearly 30°C. It was too hot so I'm currently running away to my family's cabin where it's about 22°C.
It's to hot
We have between 20-26 Celsius both day and night
In the sun it is 30 Celsius
It is extremely hot
The heat record in my city is 32,7 Celsius
It's a bit hot when we had almost 0 Celsius and snow in the middle of May
It is insanely hot, but as we say "we can't complain either". I'm actually done with it, just going swimming and playing volleyball
Thankfully, I'm from Northern Norway, so I don't think it's gotten any hotter than 20-something degrees over here
In fact, it's usually a little too cold most days
I haven't done anything but sweat and get sunburnt for the past weeks
No i'm dying in heat, in norway( Oslo) i'm lying down on the sofa not daring to move because then i'll melt and die
You have to go back to like 1970 to find a warmer summer ;-; it's so high you can't see the highest on the scale on my Phone because of how warm it is
I'm probably going to steinbruvann when it hits the warmest
I envy you
I miss our normal weather
Faen, de høres så jævlig finn ut akkurat nå!
Because it's cheaper
Yeah
It's insane
I'm staying inside for the most part, with two fans in my room
Seems to work pretty well until I actually have to walk outside, at that point I'm just praying I don't collapse on the street
Me too ;w;
I hope so
I just gotta apply sunscreen as often as I can and be in the shadows as much as possible
Yeah, I think it'll be fine too
It's just kinda frustrating rn, since I can't really do much about the weather
But thanks for the concern
Then of course the Danes said the same about Norway 200 years ago
We could never prosper without the colonial masters, but here we are
That’s awesome, I understood that sentence 100%! Is Faraoese a west Scandinavian language
No they did not
And Norway was never a Danish colony
It's quite fascinating to listen to
Denmark definitely suppressed Norway and it was treated as a colony
You can check any Norwegian history book and see that
Of course, Danish books will paint a nicer picture, but that is hardly a trustworthy witness
Ive never seen this in any history book
> Which are obviously a far more impartial source than the Danish books
Yes, of course it is more impartial then a Danish book in this respect
If you want to learn about how one country suppress another then you cannot only learn from the suppressors: If you want to learn about the British Empires and it's effects on its colonies, you should not only trust British writers
If you want to learn about the effect of slavery in the US; do not read books only written by white people
If you want to learn how Denmark suppressed Norway, do not read only Danish books
> Funnily, Wikipedia concurs with the Danes on this subject
Wikipedia: The ultimate truth
>Wikipedia concurs with the Danes on this subject, which is unsurprising, since the notion that Norway was a colony is absurd
Norway was not called a colony, but was treated as one in ma y respects
You should check a Norwegian source, like the most respected [Encyclopedia] This explains how Norway was subdued by Denmark with the use of military force
Not really a sign of equality is is
\>  Norway has never been a colony, and to claim as much is rank revisionism
Again, read something that does not come from the suppressors
I have talked to so many Danes who have absolutely no clue how Denmark behaved against Norway
There's a saying in Norway that Norwegians are born with skis on their feet, what are people from your country born with
Great question
Looking forward to read through the comments
I was born in Norway, but all I had on my feet were toes
Hahaha I love this
Makes me think I should be danish, I much prefer beer over skiing
Doctor: "Mrs

we sometimes use "gullhår i ræva", which means golden hair in your ass
Do you say that in Sweden, too
It's more of a way of saying that someone is lucky
Does sozial = social Or national
could i ask how old you are
do you know if there is any significant difference between the older and younger generation in wether they fell serbian/croatian or bosnian serb/croat
Very interesting
I didn’t know people identified as Macedonian, Epirotes etc more than Greek to this day
Many people including me think Oslo (our capital) is ugly
Personally, I'd add bø i Telemark too
Naming it after [this guy] might not have been a great idea
The ugliest city in Norway has to be Sarpsborg
It's got some nice neighborhoods here and there, but most of it looks worn down and the city centre is a gigantic biorefinery
Drammen gets picked on for being "ugly", too, mostly because it has a giant motorway bridge cutting through it, and it doesn't have the beautiful surroundings Norway's other "ugly" towns do to compensate
But there are parts of the town that are rather nice
Id give it to sauda instead tbh
I would say Otta is also famously ugly (very similiar name too funnily enough)
I have family in Västerås and I visited the place quite often
The old ABB/ASEA building is really beautiful
The worst thing I found with the city is just the amount of sprawl and the surprisingly large number of huge American-style malls that are on the outside of it
Some have been demolished but the remaining parts are protected
Bedre med en dram i timen enn en time i drammen
Drammen has become a really beautiful city
They have worked a lot on making the city beautiful, and now there are lovely walking paths and bathing areas by the river, lots of art around the town, cozy cafés and restaurants everywhere
And the sorroundings ARE beautiful
I think a popular Norwegian comedian ruined the city's reputation back in the 80s. For me, it now is among the top 10s.
Yeah Drammen and Oslo are uglier
Old Town Fredrikstad is really beautiful
Thankfully it's separated from the rest of the town by moats and a river
How dare you
No pysje-med-alt for you
Try Ålesund

Paragraf 1
>Kongeriket Noreg er eit fritt, sjølvstendig, udeleleg og uavhendeleg rike
Regjeringsforma er avgrensa og arveleg monarkisk
The kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable realm
The form of government is limited and hereditary monarchy
Feel free to correct my translation
Norway :
Article 1
"The Kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable realm
Its form of government is a limited and hereditary monarchy
Not as good as Netherlands, I must say
ARTICLE 1
Kongeriget Norge er et frit, selvstændigt, udeleligt og uafhændeligt Rige, forenet med Sverige under een Konge
Dets Regjeringsform er indskrænket og arvelig monarkisk
(Its written in danish beacuse Norway had just gotten out of a union with Denmark)
The direct translation is: The Kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and independent kingdom united with Sweden under one King
Its form of government is restricted and hereditary monarchy
It’s a little bit outdated considering we are not in an union with Sweden anymore
Not bad for a dog
The whole constitution has an official translation here:
Article 1:
> The Kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable realm
Its form of government is a limited and hereditary monarchy
Our constitution was very modern 200+ years ago, but reading it today (even after recent changes) really shows that time’s gone
The constitution predates parliamentarism in Norway by 70 years
Well, you know, I've been practicing, by reading books
I gotta say, I'm pretty happy about only getting one word wrong
That really can’t be a government website
You were so close it was kind of scary
Hmm, maybe I should consider being a translator
Go for it
Because it's a meme
It's also a thing on r/sweden except it's on Fridays
Norway kinda has it too
They use Grodan Boll, which is from an old Swedish [childrens movie]
Staying in the back of an old soviet truck in Russia in some local hero's compound probably, before we could move into the truck we first had to lift out about 20-30 boxes of vodka
There was a huge scary guard dog there that would leap after any cars that drove by, must've had serious neck problems because it jumped with its entire body weight but would come to an abrupt stop because of the anchor chain it was attached to
We threw it pieces of meat in the middle of the night while blackout drunk too
Also, when I was interrailing, me and my friend had to spend the night at the train station in Hamburg at an enclosed space down on the platform
We were joined by old alcoholics who looked like they hadn't been sober since the DDR collapsed, and who had a karaoke night
I still can't listen to AC/DC without being reminded of them
While drifting off, my friend suddenly grabbed my shoulder and said that we were leaving, because a dude in a leather trenchcoat and a cowboy hat with a riding whip broke out a coffee grinder and ground some white substance into his cigarette
We spent the rest of the night at McDonalds
Of the two of you, I bet that other dude's experience was much stranger
"So I'm from Malta and I was in Barcelona on holiday
I was just conversing with a friend when ~~a dude~~ this girl approached us on a fucking tricycle
~~He~~ She stopped to stare at me and then biked right into me before apologizing in Maltese
So you volunteered taking something you knew 100% would make you throw up
Human beings are really weird sometimes
Made me laugh
Thanks
> The throwing up in Ayahuasca is presented as being part of the cleansing ceremony
It's just that I'm willing to endure all kinds of pain rather than throwing up
It's just the worst thing in the world
(I have given birth, so I know a thing or two about pain
But I still prefer pain over throwing up

Have a great day at work
The extreme north
Basically no trees, no sun during the winter, *huge* distances to everything, lost a large share of its historic building stock during ww2 and some smaller towns are suffering from depopulation
We were a part of Sweden for almost a century until 1905
The Norwegian civil war
Not many Norwegian knows of it either, but basically between 1130 and 1240 there was constant civil wars over who had rights to the throne, bastards of earlier kings popped up like crazy at the start and everything where going wild, slowly the first generations had children and were killed, they fought it out and were killed and the third generation the factions had united into two
both sides thought they had the power to win, the southern with support of the Danes attacked the north but were destroyed in a battle outside of the northern capital, after this the southern lords were persuaded to not unite under a new king and the kingdom was united, but there were still some smaller rebellions for ten years
The two late factions were the Baglers who were supported by the pope and the Danes residing in the south, the other side, which I’m named after were the Birkebeiners
In English literally birch legged, the name came as some of them were so poor that they couldn’t afford proper footwear, the power base of them were the trøndelag region
The decisive king for the Birkebeiners were saved over the mountains by Torstein Skevla and Skjervald Skrukka, after he was born, there’s a movie by it but it isn’t super good just a okay domestic movie
He was born after the king had died to a girl who had slept with him once, bastard as always
I've heard about it
One of the ships involved was Norwegian
And before that a part of denmark for some centuries
[SS Imo] actually survived the incident and kept on sailing after some repairs, until she ran aground near the Falkland Islands, because «the man at the helm» fell down drunk, left nobody at the wheel and she ran aground at some rocks, and where abandoned

It was a joke
Perhaps not a very good one, but still
The same thing as you
Only it's Saturdays for us: lørdagssnop/lørdagsgodt
It definitely feels wrong to buy any form of candy/chips on another day than Saturday
Like, I feel silly paying for it in the store if it isn't a Saturday
For me it was always saturdays we got candy (Lørdagsgodt)
For everyone, taco is on friday
It's been in the constitution for over 200 years
In Norway when asking for water in a restaurant, tap water is the standard and you have to specify if you want bottled
It seems to have spread over here as well, though I thought this was an international thing
Oh my gosh seriously
Yep, we either call candy "snop" or "godteri (godt for short)". It may be regional, I mosrly use "snop".
Snopp means dick in norwegian too
I mean, "snopp" and "snop" are quite different when you say it out loud
Yeah, snopp is a tiny childrens dick
Snop is candy
And after writing this I feel kind of filthy
Kneppetelt og bollemus :D
We have the unique words Æ, Å and Ø. I don’t think any other country have them in their alphabet
If what I was told is true, norwegian has a word no other language has: “oppholdsvær”. It means clear weather basically
Not too unique
Quite common through northern Europe
Why do you have a designated word for soap salesman
I have heard that in finnish, you can use as many vowels as you want to describe a word
For instance, if someone was shouting, it’s grammatically correct to write “heeeeeeey”. Is that true
Sounds like Norwegian koselig as well
Also , how is it used when talking about religion or science for example
Is it used the same all over the country
u/seco-nunesap
Wait
The Danish dialects are called _trøndersk_, too
passe :)
Oh yeah I forgot that
Winter time definitely
Because that will keep mid-day and mid-night at 12 and thus our time will be in step with nature
Summer time
But I think switching works well
It's just one hour so nothing compared to adjusting after a long flight
We should keep winter time
It's the right time after all, when the sun is in the middle of the sky at noon
As someone who lives at the 63 parallel
Definitely want to keep wintertime
It would be preferable that the 4 hours of "daylight" I get during the winter is while I'm awake
Didn't read the full article, but having the capital bisected by a timezone line is madness
Did they turn it back
I'd love to have that much light in december
Wow, what a tragicomic story
Reminds me of the day Sweden switched from left-hand side to right-hand side driving on the road
There are some legendary pictures on the internet
What is weird is going to another country with a different latitude
Going from very long days with a lot of light in the summer to a place with pitch black nights further south
It's basically useless around here
You're going to get dark winters and bright summers any way
That's nice
We send a Christmas tree to London every year as a thanks for what they did to help us during WW2
I think we send a couple more to other regional cities in the UK too
At least we did in the past
That story gives me chills
Really amazing
Kind of odd knowing the amount of pizza and pasta you eat
But it is probably down to 100% HOMEMADE pizza and pasta I guess
I remember watching a documentary about a small village in Italy where everyone lives really long, and getting to look inside the pantry of different families
A lot of meat and sausages hanging from the ceiling, jars of canned vegetables, and whatever else to last them through the winter
Very fascinating that people still live like that in Europe
(Here it hasn't been like that since the 50's - 60s..)
Isn't that the case in all of northern Europe though

Well done Germany for increasing your renewable energy production

Wow, I had no idea
Sadly it didn't spread until much later

Careful with that, Germany might have an agreement with Turkey to extradite prisoners for them to serve their sentence in Turkey instead
That's neat

The start of Norwegian public healthcare system can be traced back to the 1500's. But what is consider the year when the modern version of it started I do not know
> 1956
Then I learned something new today

Okay this concept is so awesome
Norway is second so you're probably right
Trolltunga (Troll's tounge) and Preikestolen (Pulpit rock)
They are so overcrowded, while there are so many other beautiful places in the norwegian nature that are empty of tourists
I don't know if this is considered "tourist traps" as it is free to go there
It's definitely possible to travel there on a budget however
I mean, McDonalds at least wont empty your wallet for eating there and charge like 10€ or whatever for a bottle of sparkling water
That sounds cheap
Nordkapp is one, it used to cost 285 kr (ca
30€) to enter the plateau
And the money went to some hotel chain
Which infuriated the locals so much that in the 2019 they voted for SV solely because they promised to kick that hotel chain out, and make entrance free
So I guess the revolution was able to remove one tourist trap
Now they should do the entire country and especially Aker Brygge
That might explain last time i took a taxi in Turkey
I took a cab from Alanya to Gazipasa airport and i remember feeling like the drive took much longer than last time
When we finally arrived, the driver asked if i could pay 150 euros instead of 150 Lira lol
Some i stayed with some French people in southern France, and they said they didn’t really like Paris
They felt unsafe, and apart from the architecture, it didn’t really feel French
All the people trying to sell you something on every corner, and few legit French dining opportunities
When I visited Paris, I loved the architecture and the art in louvre, but the rest of the city is like any other big city
Huge crowds and traffic everywhere, rare to find a quiet area
France has so much more to give than only Paris
No surprise that a lot of the people in that spot are Norwegians
> Aker Brygge
that's the best promenade in oslo tho, its even free to be there
The dining thing, was what the southern France family told me, I don’t know enough to know if I was eating legit French food or not(even though I enjoyed what I ate
I have been in France twice, once in Paris for a week
And southern France for a month
And I loved the area I was in southern France
Toulouse,  Albi, and surrounding area
I love (!) my personal space, I enjoy skiing in winter, I wouldn't dream of pretending I'm better than anyone else, I trust the police and government, and I eat brown cheese
So yup
When on a bus, I genuinly get annoyed when a stranger sits right next to me, but I don’t feel confident enough to tell him about it
I'm a bad Norwegian in some ways
I am not great at skiing and I don't particularly like fish
I can't stand ski, I dont know how to ski either :') I have dark blonde hair and green eyes, im not very tall
I dont like sea food
Im bad at swimming and dont like to bathe in the sea or lakes
I can't stand brown cheese and i hate skiing
I don't mind if a stranger talks to me unless I'm in a hurry
We complain about them all the time, but for the most part we do trust them
They were after all elected by the people
Few foreigners like it, but most Norwegians love it
They sell it in Australia
The biggest surprise to people is usually that it's sweet, not salty
Try it on some fresh (Scandinavian) waffles, it's amazing
I can only think of one short clip in x-files where a native Norwegian spoke Swedish
Other than that it's fine
That episode in "ledgends of tomorrow" where they went to Norway to stop someone from bying nuclear weaponds
I would like to say that we have never had an atomic bomb on norwegian soil, though that reasently changed when the norwegian gouverment forced my city to take in som american submarines with nuclear bombs
But still, we don't have any nuclear bombs, and if we had, we sure as hell woulden't sell them in a godamn auction in a wearhouse of what seems to be western norway
If we wanted to get wrid of them we would probobly dismantle them
I absolutely love the comedic portrayals of Germans by Americans such as the Germans in Community or the ones in Beer Fest
Some of the best laughs I had from comedy
Recently I watched the first season of 24
Even me as a non-Serb crinched upon hearing the fake accents by the American actors
The most hilarious was when a character (American actor) was speaking with a flawless American accent, and then upon being revealed as a Serbian terrorist, he suddenly switched to having a fake thick Serbian accent
Nikola is a name in Serbia isn't it
Could be a shortening of that
Do not know about popularity but the old "nrk, dr1, ylesat and svt" movie franchise has produced some cringeworthy movies with stereotypes about all four
My impression is that Norwegians are often portrayed as tall, wild, rough and beardy in movies, often «wilderness-people». Can’t think of any particular movies, though
Then you have that Mission Impossible scene, where Tom Cruise climbs the Norwegian mountain Prekestolen, and in the movie it’s in India
>clip in x-files where a native Norwegian spoke Swedish
If you're talking about the episode [DØD KALM] (lol), I wouldn't exactly call it Swedish, haha
It's pretty hilarious - they go to "Tildeskan" in Lofoten, and meet a guy called "Henry Trondheim" in a bar full of fishermen, all clad in [lusekofter] and [islenders] with walls draped in Norwegian flags
Very Norwegian indeed
She was actually swedish and they didn't even try to mimick the current royal family there
I thought it was fine
Our king is Danish second generation immigrant
So yeas, really closley related
Woulden't make sence at all
And his daughter renouced her royalty years ago
She is still a prinsess, but they kind of figured out some deal there were she is part of the family but got wrid of some title I think
As this is based on a comic book where exaggerations aren't uncommon, I wanted to let this one slide
Also, this scene is hilarious
> An example could be at the end of "The Danish Girl" they used a shot of a fjord in Norway for Vejle fjord
They did WHAT
> tall, wild, rough and beardy in movies
Well
some of us do [look like this
> where Tom Cruise climbs the Norwegian mountain Prekestolen, and in the movie it’s in India
That is cringeworthy for India, not Norway
But I guess Norway is usually portrayed in a good light (although sometimes wild and hairy), hence why we don't really find it cringe worthy
Why wouldn't that make sense
Our two previous kings both married their cousins
Do you know if someone in Bosnia would
There's a professional cs go player from there who uses niko as his  in game name
It woulden't make sence that a Norwegian prinscess would have to marry in to the danish royal family considering how closly related they are to denmark
Haakon and Maud were first cousins
Olav and Märtha were first cousins
And any potential Danish-Norwegian marriage wouldn't even be between first cousins
If you're talking about the current parent generation, it would be second cousins, and if you're talking about their children, it would be third cousins
In royal circles, that's hardly even being related
So what the hell are you talking about
I didn't know it but It's actually in some European countries
I am talking about todays standard, obviusly I know that, but also thinking about royal circles, it is really not that long ago since they were part of the danish Royal family
Olav was Danish born, so thinking in that sence it would make more sence of them marrying in to another royal family then the Danish one
Also, fun fact, Norway most likley chose that family because of Maud
It would give us alot of power having a British princess in our royal family
But as well as that
It woulden't make sence of us being poor either
We were poor before the oil, but even then we did pretty well because of our systems
But I digress
It would make more sence for Norway to marry into another european royal family if it was purley for diplomatic reason
Ok, first off, it's "sense", not "sence". Secondly, Norway wasn't poor before oil
We were in the top half in Europe in terms of GDP per capita throughout the 20th and 19th century
Okey, but we were kinda poor in the early 1900's, and yeah, we had good systems that made it better
You know, there is a reason we have the term "fetebarn", and that is because some people were to poor to actually feed their children, so they sent them to relatives to fatten them up
And, I have only gotten a 5 hours of sleep tonight, because of where I live, there is barly any light outside, and there wasen't any when I wrote that comment, and my english wrigting is shit nowadays, especially when I am tiered
And I don't feel like checking up on the spelling on every word, when you understand my point perfectly fine
So I would appreciate if you focused on my point rather then my grammar
And apologise for being to tiered to elaborate more
And you still get my point, it still would make more sense for a Norwegian royal to marry in to another european royal family then the danish one, if it was purley out of diplomatic reasons
Hmmm, must be sweden
Don’t know why everyone believes in it when it’s clearly east Norway
Took a taxi in the north of Norway a few years back
The driver explained how there was no climate change/global warming
This is a bit hard to believe if you've live in the north of Norway since the evidence is fairly obvious
His theory is that the government  secretly moved the arctic circle further north
This has resulted in winter seeming warmer, but we're actually just further south than we used to be
In relation to the arctic circle, everything is as it should be
El Psy Congroo
Hopefully he was just bored and made shit up to tell the customers for a laugh
Depends
Sometimes the first and sometimes the latter, but mostly the first
The latter one is too much of a chore to write
Definetly α. Nobody I know writes a. We didn't learn it in school and nobody does
I write not a(couldn’t find the other)
I write cursive though
I write it like «a», but it’s something I chose to do, I never learned to write it like that in school
Likewise in Norway
[Like this] though I like to leave the 'e' part a bit more open (wider) to make it more distinct from 'a'.
[Like this]
Haven't seen an æ like that before, but it was still understandable
Same for Norway
I made the same decision in junior high, and have the same problem with my r's and v's. Some people also first believe that my a's are mirrored s'es or sloppy z's, as I draw a with a single stroke
In Norway, we want Iceland and Greenland back from you Danes
Also Jämtland, Härjedalen, and Bohuslän from Sweden
&#x200B;
And more for the joke: Conquer Sweden for 100 years and Denmark for 400 years, just at payback
Even more jokingly, reconquer our parts of the UK
We joke about retaking Jemtland and Herjedalen, maybe we should team up against Sweden ;) Just a joke, of course
Unless you want to do it
Haha, no, I'm kidding
Unless
Those damn swedes
We want jemtland, herjedalen and båhuslen
We sometimes joke about taking back Jamtland from Sweden
Just don't joke about it with the Germans, they're very literal minded
Wait until you hear we ruled Denmark in the 1040s
Who said anything about *buying* it
But,  but our generational talents
it's so annoying when countries are afraid of actual war over a music contest
it’s not our fault we’re so cool and good at music B)
Big news in Norway
Fervent anti vaccination beliefs on both ends of the political spectrum
America is somehow very proud of having a separated state and church, yet the President is sworn in on a bible, your country motto is “in God we trust” and just the prevalence of God/Christianity
Also, does the general American actually believe it’s the greatest/best country on earth
*I’ve just thought of another one that I don’t think I’ve seen mentioned here: all your drug adds on TV
Like what the actual fuck
Your whole society is built around the car, so why not make the driver's education better
Here, it's a 30 hour lesson system with an intro course, practical test, theory test, lessons on driving in the dark, driving on slippery conditions, and you're also expected to practice driving a lot with your parents or other adults
My impression is that you can basically pick up your license for a fee and a small practical test in the US
Is this correct
This is not just cultural but a little linguistically related too
I'm not comfortable with the "race" concept, and I find it both confusing and very
incorrect in my eyes
I know there's black, white, Asian (but is it all Asians, or just East and South East Asians
) and then I think there is Hispanic and Latino/a but I don't know what they mean
And then there's just "mixed".
It's also just because in my native lang, using the word "race" for people makes you sound like an old school nazi
The only time you use race for something is for dogs and cats and such, not people
So yeah, it doesn't sit right with me, but I understand identifying your race in North America (and some other places, like Singapore or South Africa, where they also still use the term "coloured" I think
) is very important to people so I only criticise it with other non-Americans mostly
But to be honest it all sounds like a recipe for racism to me :P (not saying Europe's concept of ethnicity and nationality is racism proof by any means
- That you only vote very wealthy people into congress
(Edit: Sorry, forgot about the "besides politics"-part)
- That no one marches the streets demanding all citizens having access to affordable health care
- That parents in some states are allowed to hinder their children getting basic education
- How Americans are able to always being able to small-talk with anyone, anywhere
- That in some states keeping tigers as pets is legal
(Yes, I just watched Tiger King)
How much they like to argue about everything on the internet
I even had a argument with a pizza delivery guy on vacation in Florida
He went from asking where i was from to asking me what i thought about Norway being socialist
I just wanted a Pizza, dammit lol
Another confusing thing is that American fast food and soda tend to taste better outside of the US
I think it has something with using ingredients to make production cheaper that isn't legal many other places
Here in Norway for example the McDonalds beef, potatoes and chicken is domestic
How they have the most broken healthcare system of any civilised country, and so many want to keep it
You have to be 16 to drive, 18 to have sex and JOIN THE ARMY, and 21 to have a beer
The first thing probably comes from the fact that america was colonized, so unless you're native, you have a heritage outside of america
I'm also annoyed by this
However, I did also realise those people are the ones that are the most interested in talking to you about "our" culture, they get thrilled if you teach them a word or two etc
Like, not too long ago I met a Canadian dude who said his family was of Norwegian heritage or something (because I said I was from Norway) and it meant his great grandparents I think were native norwegians and came to Canada
He didn't know the language at all, but he *did* have a very Norwegian name
And my first reaction was kind of like "oh great, you're *that* kind of person (internally
I would *never* make fun of somebody being excited about their little drop of blood from overseas), but he also asked a lot some fun questions that I could answer, which I noticed was not a thing the other North Americans (Canadian and American) I met did
I asked them quite a few questions about their country and life, but they *very* rarely asked me
Maybe they expected me to just tell them myself
I, a European, sometimes do that in the summer to feel a little rebellious >:) (but very rarely cause I don't want dirt on the carpet
> Flags
[We like flags too
I think people tend to prefer what they have always known
> it's nice but I can't help but feel wierd like "What do they want from me
At least you are from further south
Imagine what we are thinking up here
But really - most people find Americans refreshing
No fucking roundabouts
They were in a really tense political war with the USSR for about 40 years though
I kinda get it
Why do they feel more (Irish, Italian, Polish) than American I wonder
Same here
If anyone put this on their form it would be viewed as extremely racist and be front page news for weeks
They really are a fascinsting and terrifying breed
I mean what are you going to do when covid has a vaccine
They wont take it and presumably their kids are screwed too
Why not just get sworn in on the constitution
That's an important document in the history of the USA
If a president did chose to be sworn in on the Quran there would surely be outrage
I just find that there is such a juxtaposition between being very proud that there's a separation between church and state yet Christianity plays such a major role in policies and just a lot of the general life in the US
It's fine to be religious and that will affect policies, but it seems way more extreme in the US than in a lot of European countries for example
Ok, but still
What
In Norway it is illegal to give alcohol to minors under 18
Ignore how late I am, but globalization
Not the best quality photo, but it was the first one that came up when looking for one with a flag
A normal flag you are supposed to put up on special occasions only (someone in your family gets married, or turns 60 or on our constitution day and so on
) However - a triangel shaped flag (we call it vimpel, not sure what the English name is) you can have up all year around
> but when you are walking in the street and the stranger smiles at you it feels wierd
I have been out smiling at people today actually
And even had a short conversation with two strangers
(One lady asked for the way, and a guy had a dog that was eager to greet my children)
So these things even happen up here
Yeah
That's a generalization about the US, at least in Norway - lol
But are for instance Americans with Asian heritage doing the same
30% Indian, 50% Indonesian and 20% Mongolian
You could prob get away with it being mandatory in Europe, Scandinavia, uk etc but I think what worries me about the states is if you make it mandatory - I think they are armed and angry enough to literally start riots ‘rise up’ etc
They’re so over dramatic and liberty / rights are godly virtues, I wouldn’t be surprised if lives are lost
Your state may not officially be part of church, but church and religion still heavily affects the state
That's the juxtaposition I find strange
We do not have a state church any longer
That was changed back in 2012
Now personally I find it very hypocritical that lots of Norwegians still baptize their children when they don't go to church or believe in God
I am not one of those people though, so I can't speak for them
For reference, here in Norway we don't have a drinking age per se, but the stores are prohibited from selling beer to anyone below 18 and wine+liquor can only be sold to people aged 20+. The same goes for pubs
If you can acquire alcohol as a teen, have at it
It is of course prohibited to personally sell or gift alcohol within the aforementioned limits
That's so wholesome
Well, at least there is Finland
Sure, as Christianity is the major religion that will mainly affect policies and tradition
That's natural
I still find it .. odd
Like take abortion as an example, which I realize is controversial in general, but in the US (and other countries) religion decides a lot of the laws surrounding abortion
The US is supposed to be the land of the free, yet a lot of states make it near impossible for women to get an abortion due to religion
I'm not saying you have to support abortion, but the choice should be up to the woman and what she believes in
It's still called the "Church of Norway", but it's no longer the state church
I would say a majority of people still baptize their children and most young people have a church confirmation
I also find it very lazy that people just baptize their children because it's tradition, but then again I was not baptized, I am not religious and I would not baptize my own children
I actually feel like it's quite disrespectful actually towards those who genuinely do believe in God and feel a strong connection to the church
There are a lot of beautiful churches
The old stavechurches are very special
The funny thing about that is that a lot of the people who are so intensely against abortion are also pro capital punishment
If murder is wrong surely it's also wrong to kill a criminal, even though a criminal could be seen as a bad person
Well, I'm glad that I as a non-religious person isn't way off base when it comes to thinking that "tradition baptizers" are kinda disrespectful, lol
Oh, that's cool
Lots of people of Norwegian ancestry up there, right
Well, yes there will always be variation
I'm just speaking about the general vibe you get from the media (both local and international)
Damn, almost more Norwegian Americans than Norwegians in Norway
That's true
Don't meet many Americans in Norway, if they're here they're probably looking for the northern lights or Frozen-land
I try to read threads on Reddit, but that can be quite the clusterfuck to say the least
Sheesh, there are so damn many people in the US
Norway is pretty great when you get over the prices
Beautiful nature, with lots of variation
Ohh, I'll check it out
Thanks for the link
Yes, we have paid leave when moving
And I don't know how many countries have this, but in Norway you can get paid a full salary if your child can't attend child care for medical reasons or the child is sick and needs 24/7 care at home for a longer period
In norway you have 3x 3 day sick leaves per year, you can take out on your own volition and without any required advance warning
As far as I understand there is also 16 weeks that  can be arranged among the parents however they want
In total it is 49 weeks (if you want to get payed 100% salary)
15 for dad, 15 for mom
And also  3 additional weeks for mother which is for the time  right before the birth
(Plus the 16 weeks I mentioned
For 80% salary it is 59 weeks in total
I would say having paid leave when moving is probable the least important paid leave of them all
Most people would be able to move over the weekend instead of in the middle of the week
But - paid sick leave for all workers is something the US really needs
You are right, 49/59 weeks in total is correct - plus the last 3 weeks before birth, so 12 months in total
It's really hard to make friends after you have finished education
It's not that much of a problem for Norwegians who are used to it and retain their friends from youth, but it leads to older immigrants often struggling to make local friends despite being largely accepted, sadly making integration more difficult for them
The best advice is to get a hobby and meet people that way
My god, is it expensive
When I left Norway I was blown away by how much less I was spending every month
Transportation, food, bills - all very steep
As someone who's lived a long time abroad, we do have it VERY nice in Scandinavia compared to a lot of the world
Not perfect by any means, of course, but it is really good
And that is not to toot our own horn or anything
Our reputation is not completely unwarranted, though it can be a bit overhyped
That said, we are not THAT far ahead of some of our neighbours, like Germany, Finland, and even the UK, and some other places in the world like Canada, Australia, South Korea, etc
We can be quite arrogant and entitled, and there is a lot more casual racism than most natives would admit (not quite as systematic and oppressive as say the US, but it definitely exist in social)
There is also an insane amount of ineffective bureaucracy here for major projects, leading to further increased costs
My Town has blocked off one our major streets for a year and a half to create something like 150 meters of sidewalk
Most of the time no-one is working there, but the road remains closed
Our seasons can br a bit more extreme than most foreigners realise, and it only gets worse the further north you go
This does not only include temperature, but also daylight, rain, etc
Cost of living can also be quite high, even compared to our increased wages
This is not a Scandinavian problem only, but I think what might be the biggest surprise for people moving here (if you only come as a tourist you wont necessarily notice) - is the level of racism
We might not be as vocal and violent towards immigrants as in certain other countries, but racism is still effecting most (all
) immigrant on one level or another
240 er den foretrukne rånebilen her
I so wish we had a cafe and restaurant culture
It's one of the underestimated things I'm the most envious about from the south
It is meaningless to call it steep unless you compare it to your income
Prices may be lower abroad, but the same goes for salaries, so your actual purchasing power might be the same or worse
Meanwhile, Sweden is the country we go to for cheap wares
Always thought that was a German thing, so shows how much I know
I have a theory there:
- We get less D-vitamins than people living in countries further south
- We Nordics live more apart than relatives further south
We are independent, which is good, but we sometimes don't realise how important close contact with family and relatives are when it comes to mental health
I met people trough hobbies
also friends of friends and online like deviantart, instagram, hobbygroup on fb
Anine and manga is pretty popular and we used to have a big con each year with over 10 000 people ( sadly they stopped due to unpopularity over how they treated artstands and how expensive it was) I met some good friends trough that
So hobby is one of the best ways to get friends :)
I think it's a lot easier to get to know Norwegians outside of Norway
I have heard some Americans complain about the same thing I am, but particularly in Europe it seems like it's not too unfair to generalize it to the north whereas the south is typically more outgoing in both a casual and meaningful way
People are a lot less interested in interacting with people they don't know in a way that is meaningful
This is all just my personal opinion of course
No, but it seems to be more prominent the further north you go and Scandinavia makes up a decent portion of the north
In my experience it is a contrast to how in e.g. Greece or Spain people seem warmer towards strangers and it's easier to make a friend of someone you just run into somehow, and I wish we'd be more like that here as well
I live in northern norway, it's alot darker here, I think it starts in mid-september
Queues are prioritized
Cancer has a high priority, something that's uncomfortable but probably not dangerous or progressing gets a low priority
You are obviously not Norwegian
Here sweden hate is not exclusive to the internet, but its mostly just satirical
I was shocked about how cheap everything was when I went to Tokyo
A bottle of half a liter pepsi costed 8 kr
Pretty big difference from 22 kr
We went to an highend resturant and got a 3 dish meal ( apetizer, main dish and dessert) for 400 kr
I can't belive people think its expensive in japan :')
My income stayed the same
I was still working for the Norwegian company who paid me the same salary, but I was living/working abroad
I live in Hungary now and while things are generally cheaper here I was shocked to learn that clothing and electric products were almost the same price as back in Norway
I feel sorry for people who need to but that on a not-Norwegian salary
Groceries are typically quite cheap though, and the difference in the price of alcohol is just insane
The price of beer at bars in Norway is a great factory to why pre-parties are a big part of Norwegian culture so you can save money on getting drunk *before* going out
I suspect not, as he/she is absolutely right
Most foreigners tend to befriend other foreigners
[Here] is a list in Wikipedia
Don't know how up-to date it is
Gå for en Amazon da
De er tøffe biler som er ganske sjeldne
I hvert fall her på berget
Yeah, we're good at English, but that does not mean we want to use it at our jobs or personal lives
Now be me who currently live in Hungary where beer and wine typically cost about one tenth of what it does in Norway
Just my nationality makes me feel so privileged it's almost humiliating
A lot of people here don't realize just how lucky we are
There are some pretty idyllic towns along the southern coast which are almost never mentioned to foreigners because they're pretty far from mountains and fjords
From Egersund in the west to Kragerø in the east, there are around 10 towns which share a similar style, often bright white houses on relatively narrow, winding streets leading down to a coastline with inlets and archipelagos
The southern coast is well known in Norway as a summer destination, but I don't think it sees that many foreign tourists
It's in my German school book and my teacher went there so maybe not a secret
The Dutch word for people is mensen (if I remember correctly)
Mensen in Norwegian is your period (ya know, bloody monthly mess)
We have Pikk, pronounced exactly like Pick, but it means dick
The Norwegian word for catching someone, as in to solve a case and apprehend the criminal, is to "fakke". So there is some resemblance with fuck here
In Norwegian: Snop means candy
In Swedish: Snopp means a cock
(There's a slight difference in pronounciation, but not enough to avoid confusion)
In Norwegian: Bolle means bun
In Danish: Bolle means to fuck
In other words - we're an innocent bunch compared to our rancid neighbours
I would like to add some similarities between Norwegian and Swedish as well that I can think of right now:
Glass (NOR) is the same as in english, but glass (SWE) is the same as ice cream
Rolig (NOR) is the same as calm or relaxed in english, but rolig (SWE) is the same as funny
Norwegian: Bestemme = decide/be in charge
Haha, it probably said "fartskontroll" but I get why it's funny
There is actually a Norwegian Racing driver who is notoriously bad at english and he has some pretty good quotes to him:
"It's not the fart that kills you, it's the smell" (fart = speed and smell = crash/bang, depending on context, in Norwegian)
"I had a stop in the start"
"I'm driving around the corner, and crash in the Christmas tree"
"I had bad pigs in my dekk" (pigs mean studs, and dekk means tires in Norwegian)
"But but, it isn't only only you know" (a normal Norwegian saying directly translated to English)
"The ratt is loose" (ratt = steering wheel)
I don't have any trusted sources for these sayings though, but any Norwegian should be able to confirm :p
Iceland
No mosquitoes
Well, I don't really want to leave Norway, but Denmark I guess
Switzerland or Italy
I either want it pretty cold or pretty warm
As long as there is little rain I frankly don't care
I don't really know, but I've always wanted to live in Spain
Specifically Madrid, although I've never been
Really just wanna live there, get a decent job and watch all of Real Madrid's home matches, honestly
I know a bit of Spanish, and could probably learn it fluently if I really wanted to, but yeah
I'm not sure, maybe Croatia
I'm tired of all the rain and darkness in the winter here
Czechia, just based on the beautiful nature in kingdom come deliverance
There's loads in the summer
Especially in the north
In my experience not a lot but there are some
Nightlife and drug capital of Europe
We don’t get it either
The fact that I don't want to leave Norway is the thing stopping me
Sure, I can understand Danish, but I'll stay here
Haha that’s cute
greetings from Bergen, Norway, the rainiest city in europe
Det finnes ikke dårlig vær, bare dårlige klær :)
The way swedish sounds like to other scandinavian speakers is like; their words (especially the endings to words) are similar to many extremely rural dialects, but they speak with the most feminine and seemingly arrogant (to us at least) intonation; so to me they’re just posh farmers ;)
Well, I'd choose Denmark *because* it's similar and I like our country already
Zuid-Dietsland
Was on vacation in California, swimming in the pool at a hotel when I heard some young men speaking in Swedish about the exercises I was doing in the pool
They were complaining that women do too many weight loss fads
I don’t speak Swedish, but it’s close enough to Norwegian that I knew exactly what they said
I didn’t say anything, just glared
Was in Greece with a friend, we were around 16
We overheard these two girls speaking about those two cute guys over there in swedish/norwegian
Got ourselves a couple of dates for the rest of the trip
Not much of an experience, just a couple of Japanese chicks who were commenting on the food I was carrying on public transport, on my way home from work
弁当持ってるじゃん！
About 2 years ago me and my gf went to a restaurant in Oslo for her birthday and while ordering I noticed a man and a woman (probably husband and wife) staring at us and the woman asks her husband "You think they're gonna run when the bill comes
" (as we were 16 at the time) and I turn around faking being surprised and I reply in german "No, why do you think we would do that
" and they just go full-on silent and for the rest of the evening
My girlfriend was probably more shocked than they were, as she had no idea I spoke german
In Norway you have to take either French, Spanish or German in high school, so she knew I took german, but not that I spoke it fluently About 20m later they pay the bill and get up to leave and the husband leaves me a 200kr note and says "Looks like we've learnt our lesson" and laughs
I wanted to give it back to him, but me being 16 with no job and a very costly bill coming soon I took the money
TL;DR - Went to a restaurant with my gf and german couple talks in german if we were gonna run when the bill came and I replied to them in german
The couple went completely silent and after 20m they gave me 200kr note afterwards and apologized
Checked Swedish wiki, it mentions that lingon jam is often served with meat dishes and blood pudding, so it does seem strange that he objected to serving it with sausage
And Tampere is not in a bilingual area, is it really all that likely that he would be understood
"I have a girlfriend in *country*"
I never knew there was another kind of card deck other than the “normal” aka French one
We use the french one with 52 cards and 4 types with one card in all types
I didnt know there exosted other styles of decks as this is the only one ive seen
Never seen it before, but as a very frequent cardplayer, it looks hella COOL, and i want a deck
We use a weird deck for Svarteper (Old Maid)
How interesting
Yeah, that's why I put normal in quotes
I know the french one as "normal" cards
I've never even heard of that game, lol
I had no idea there was so much to know about cards
Fascinating
Det er ganske kjekt, anbefalast
Kan spelast med vanlig kortstokk også.
They already do that here
I think the system works nice enough as it is
It could be better
My grandpa *really* shouldn’t be allowed to drive
I dread meeting him in traffic (I’ve already done it twice, not a good experience)
Interesting idea, but I guess it will vary greatly depending on where you live
Last time I took a taxi it costed me 500NOK (about 50€) for a 15 minute trip
To the local city it's a bit further, maybe 20 minutes
This was at night so prices are a bit cheaper during the day, but still, it would cost me about 100€ for a round trip to the local city
If you go there once a week, that's 400€ a month just for 4 trips
And then you have the other trips to get groceries and maybe see some friends
So you'd probably have to double that to 800€ a month in taxi bills
Now lets say you get a cheapish car for about 10k€, that you plan to have for 5 years until its too costly to keep anymore
Thats 2k€ a year, say 200€ per month
Include repairs/maintennace (150€), insurance (100€), fuel(70€)
Totals to 520€ per month, although, if you are unlucky with a lot of prpblems woth the car it could be much more expensive to repair
I think I'd keep the car until I couldn't drive anymore
I guess maybe I consider short distances to be longer than you haha
:D I don't  get me talking about people living in the outskirt that have an hour drive to the mailbox :)
It's not that rural here though, 5 minute drive to the store, 20 minutes to the city, an hour to the capital
There just isn't any public transport, which would make the equation different
5-10C, I will atleast wear a sweater, but jacket if i'm going to be outside for a prolonged period
0C - I'll concider wearing my winter jacket
Down to -10C where i definitely will wear a good thick jacket and something warm on my head
-20C I'll use Jacket + Wool underneath,  warm hat and gloves
-30C Thick jacket + Thick outer layer + wool underneath, warm hat, thick gloves
-40C i'll wear my winter hiking gear, which is basically the same, just rated for colder weather
Sidenote: -10C is better than -2C, and I'd much rather have -10C because all the moisture in the air has evaporated so it *feels* warmer
^^^ps, ^^^i ^^^live ^^^in ^^^the ^^^north
Over 15C - T-shirt
Below 5C - Spring/fall jacket
Below 0C - Light winter jacket or extra layer under spring/fall jacket
Below 10C - Winter coat
Winter, once it dips below 0⁰, I'd say its cold
But thats relative to where I live in Norway (Stavanger)
I used to live in northern Sweden (Skellefteå), I'd say under -10⁰ was cold
That said, once you hit -10⁰ its just fucking cold in general
I grew up in Australia too, there I'd consider anything under 4⁰ cold
Depend how you see it
A 'good jacket' as in 'my best jacket' is at -5C. I use a thinner jacket at warmer temperaures
T-shirt
------------- 20 C
Hoodie
------------- 10 C
Autumn coat
------------- 0 C
Winter jacket
------------- -20 C
Winter jacket, alpine pants, snow boots
Like, cold in the winter is below -10C. In the summer it's below 10C.
Around 5 degrees celcius
But we can be okay down to -20
A good jacket, as a winter coat
Well, I didn't wear one last winter, even at -10°C. Although I do consider it cold when it's below 0°C.
20°C is bathing weather
That is sometimes the hottest temperature we get in Northern Norway
Came here to say this
Nothern Norway is cold af
Depends alot on the wind for me, -10 and no wind is great, can do in a t-shirt really
But a little movement in the air and it gets cold quickly
Worst weather there is is 0 to 4c, wind and whatever sludd is called in english
Wow, forgot about that
Thanks
I think it's called slush in English
But yeah, wind plays a big role in whether it's cold or not
Mostly just a stream of associations, but I guess I can summarise the 3 first as union, empires, and culture
Really
I know we're strictly speaking in Europe, but here we tend to think of "the continent" as somewhere else
Move over, *I* live there
I definitely also think of blue
I think I have more in common with, say, Canadians than with the Mediterraneans
(To my detriment, to be sure
Sorry, Canadians
) But Sweden is at least slightly more continental than Norway
For me, the worst months are November and January
They're dark, dreary and wet
In December the streets and homes are filled with Christmas lights, which helps a lot
Having an alarm clock with a wake-up light is also an essential for me
Waking up with the light already on is so helpful in the morning
Well, you can see the darkness as depressing, and of course I also agree that the summer with light nearly 24/7 is much preferable
I don't live furthest north though, up there they  don't see the sun at all between roughly December 1st and January 15th
Down here sunrise in December is around 9:00, and sunset around 15:00
So it's dark when I drive to work, and dark when I drive home from work
However, every time of year has its charm
Summer of course with its long warm days, fall with leaves falling and the beauty that follows, and then winter with its harsh weather, cold temperatures and is a period where nature rests and recharges for the coming spring
Winter in nature is also beautiful, even in parts where there is little or no snow
Nature is resting, recharging, but still there is so much beauty in it
Especially if there's snow
Also, winter is the time of year to stay indoors, do hobbies you enjoy and listen to the wind howling and the forces of nature pounding on the windows and walls of your home and feel good being inside and warm
In short, enjoy each time of year, do something different during each season - it being summer, fall, winter or spring, and look forward to those things year by year
You know - there are lots of things to be happy about during winter as well
It can be indoor activities, outdoor activities, attend a choir, have fun playing handball with friends, you get the idea, something to do during the dark months that makes you look forward to them
It's about mindset, it's about enjoying what you have, not wishing for what you cannot have if you get the idea
Good luck, and I hope you'll be fine
I use my Philips Hue lights as a wake-up light, which helps a lot to get me out of bed, and bright lights in my bathroom to stay awake
I also try to do something outdoors every day
This winter it rained something like 30/31 days in january, which honestly was more of a challenge than the darkness
December has Christmas, which helps a lot
February has a school holiday, which we use to visit family
January hopefully has snow, which gives us a chance to go skiing, and the kids can go sledging
Some of us even somewhat like the darker and rainy (snowy) months just for the fact that we can snuggle up with a book or in front of the TV without feeling too guilty about it
Summer was anyways never my favorite time of year
My favorite is autumn, and second favorite is spring
So although winter is my least favorite time of year, but it does have it perks
Remember to Get your vitamin D in
It helps a lot
And is what is keeping me going during the winter
You're saying you don't alternate between not going above and not going below the horizon for months upon a time
Daylight lamps do help against it
Also, where I live we often make iy more cozy with candles and stuff
So I guess the best thing is to just try to make your indoors very nice and comfortable
In norway we have an expression called kos or koselig
And thats what it's about, make it cozy around you and just make the best out of it
I have alot of experience with this, at worst we probobly only have one hour of daylight in a day
What makes it worth living here is the 23 hours of sunlight in a day in the summer
Keeping your rooms bright will help, sometimes I even sleep with the lights on, but also try to learn to appreciate the darkness
Try not to let it stop you from doing things, especially outside
Go out of the cities on a clear night and make a night picnic to see the stars (which is amazing as a romantic date, speaking from experience)
Take a walk by the rivers or parks (I did this while in Melbourne for a few days, and it was beautiful)
If you have any interest in photography, taking ohotos at night can be really fun too (experiment with long exposures and such)
It's in darkness that the lights are allowed to play
Wet in January
It's snowing here right now
> And eating more sweets because it's Christmas season helps
I pig out on the savoury stuff
Like some of the cheeses I stash in the spare fridge for a few years to mature
You get sunlight
> autumn
> shirt-weather
Something's not adding up
February can be pretty sad, but it's such a short month and since I'm a teacher, we usually have the winter holiday at the end of the month, so it doesn't feel so bad for me
Having something to look forward to helps a lot
At the end February we have winter holidays, so that helps a lot as well
I'm a huge fan of skiing and biathlon, so I do love waking up early, lighting some candles, making a good breakfast and enjoying the skiing
LOL, so glad I have winter holidays in February
Yep
I absolutely love mine
West coast, lol
It snowed just this morning here, actually
Ooh, interesting
In Norway schools have the period between Christmas and New Year off and come back around 2-3-4th Jan, but then we have a winter holiday at the end of Feb usually
I know people bike to work in Norway all through the winter and I just don't understand
Now, I'm on the west coast and we barely get snow, but it's just so wet and cold
I can't imagine biking to work
When you have a weeks holiday in a three and a half-ish week month that feels very short
I'm sorry :( My family hates me because I have all the same holidays as kids
One of the great advantages of being a teacher
It's not something I hear that often but I think we would say it like it takes balls without worrying about size
Because Switzerland
Forgot about that one
Legendary comment chain
I always vote for one of currently 3 parties that align with my views, depending on what particular issues are closest to me for the next 4-year period
Thing is, I never do ‘tactical voting’ because at the end of the day, I don’t feel like any of the parties in Norway are ‘bad’ per se, they just have different solutions to problems
Our closest thing to a far-right populist party is the closest I get to not wanting someone near parliment at all, but even they are just sometimes crazy right-wing liberals
Basically, I vote with my heart, and even if the opposition end up with the majority, I still don’t fear for my country at all with Erna Solberg in charge
> Have you ever voted on somebody/a party that you truly respect or believe in
Yes I have
At every election
Voting for me has always been about finding the party I agree with the most
Sometimes it's the issues, sometimes it's the values and sometimes is the people that are the deciding factors, but it's always the one I like the most
Of course no party perfectly mirrors my views, but I feel there are several that I mostly agree with and could vote for
I have always voted for the party I have believed the most in (i.e. never done any tactical voting), but I have also never found a single party here that I agree with everything on
> Thing is, I never do ‘tactical voting’ because at the end of the day, I don’t feel likr any of the parties in Norway are ‘bad’ per se, they just have different solutions to problems
I agree
I can't remember last time I saw a young person smoke
Very few teenagers start smoking these days as its seen as very unhealthy, and even more importantly - tacky
So the typical smoker is 40+. But even among the 40+ many have stopped smoking
Almost nobody smoke here anymore
It’s seen as a bad habit, unhealthy, out of fashion, uneducated and a plague for everyone around you hence the strict laws forbidding smoking in most public places
Left for the artists, the poor, hillbillies and bohemian to do
Im not shure, I dont know any thay do smoke to be honest
But smokers are usally pretty chill and good at beeing considerate here
They avoid standing so the smoke blow in peoples faces or just randomly smoke in a crowd
I feel like not that maney people smoke, but that might just be due to strickt rules about smoking in public
I feel the little bags of tobakko people stuff in their lips are more commen
Sadly many people spit them everywhere and just litter
Alot of people are great at trowing them away properly though
I think snus is an important factor as many switched to that
I don't have them but I believe the numbers for snus are not going down
I have been a smoker for almost 20 years, and I quit a year and a half ago
This winter I was invited to a party at my best friend's place, which took place in the winter garden
We were almost 20 people there, and the non-smokers were a minority
Mind you, this is a bunch of rural people who party almost every weekend
Guess smoking is more of a thing in rural areas and with people who party hard and often
Made me laugh
Thanks
I can barely remember seeing anyone smoking either
SSB (a statistics bureau) states that, in 2019, around 9% (!) smoked daily
Usage of tobacco products, however, is about 23%. That being the infamous snus (a variant of snuff) at 14%, which is only popular in Sweden and Norway, as far as I understand it (there is a EU ban on the product, with the exception of Sweden)

Edit: typo
How much is a pack nowadays anyway
150 kr
I'm sure many of us silently shame them inside our heads when we see smokers
Last time was yesterday actually
A older lady that sat down on the (rasteplass-) table next to us
My husband tried to hint that the wind was blowing all the smoke our way, but she probably pretended not to hear him
But a lot of the people I see smoking are often not Norwegian, but construction workers from Poland for instance
(For the record I like both Poland and Polish people) :) But nowadays no kids run to hide behind the school to smoke - like they did when I was a teenager
Times have changed a lot
Wow, I would have thought it was higher
It's not a very significant health risk, though, so for public health it is much, much better
You dont have to get nicotine either
I have vaped with 0 nicotine, I diden't want to get addicted
( i never smoked before so avoiding it sounded like a smart thing to do)
It dos taste good
But I don't vape much to be honest, I think last time was last year
Going from 24 to 3 is really good though
And just by vaping instead of smoking you are alredy doing you lungs a big favor :)
That is so true
And better for whoever is around as well
And yor breath, clothing, house won't smell like hells gate
I still remember that time I bought some manga on finn and had to leave them out on the balcony for 2 døgn to air out
They reeked of smoke
The kind that smell so strong that your house start to smell as well
Other that that it was in great condition though
Lovely people that sold them, hope their health is good
Well, we all like different things and thats alright :) Its good that it bring you good memories
My husband is Norwegian, so the choice of country was pretty easy
We chose to live here rather than in the States because in most ways, particularly those that are important to us, our life is better here than it would be there
Why Norway specifically
Depends on what you consider decent pay of course, but shouldn't it be quite easy to find that
We have (outside of current crisis time) low unemployment and lots of people move for work here every year
We're not Sweden
On holiday in Spain, picking up some fruit at a fruit shop run by an Indian guy
He starts some small talk in broken English, asks me where I'm from
I answer Norway
He looks at me, baffled, and said 'where
', so I said Norway in Spanish
Still looked confused AF
So I tried 'Scandinavia'. He still hasn't cottoned on
I sigh
Pick up my bag of mangoes and quietly mutter 'next to Sweden'
'AHHHH, YOU'RE SWEDISH
Feelings were felt
You
I like you
No, Norwegians have had their own identity separate from both Danes and Swedes for over a thousand years
Norway was under both of them under different times, but they were Norwegians none the less
Kind of like how Scotland is in a union with England, but they are not English, they are Scottish
Germans are not the same as Germanic though
By that logic Spaniards are Romanian, because they speak a Romance language
How does that make sense
I mean we function as a republic
It's not like the king actually decides stuff
He just stands there and waves
But, but, your flag is a cross like ours
Just like Iceland too
That must mean you're a part of Scandinavia
Edit: forgot the /s
That's disgusting
Oh my gosh mine did that as well
And then wouldn't shut up about how that was wrong
Wouldn't let me get a word in, as if I don't know a thing about my own country
Stockholm calls themselves the capital of Scandinavia, and we hate it
ok but what if i have potatos with my schnitzel can i then have sauce on my potatos or do i need to eat dry potatos aswell
Didn't think of that
In norwegian there is a difference between "kors" (Christian cross) and "kryss" (just two lines crossing)
Yeah
It's a result of the Austro-Hungarian Military Front against the Ottomans
Ah, I didn't mean to imply that there were no Serbs to begin with and then the austro-hungarians opened the door and suddenly there were tons of serbs
Of course there were Serbs there before
But, perhaps uniquely is the huge concentration of Serbs, that doesn't happen without some policy, I thought you could accredit this to the military frontier with the Ottoman Empire
When it comes to the YSR-borders, I'm an amateur, but I though the Croatian border came from the old internal borders from the Austro-hungarian borders + some border changes from world war 1
Block out curtain are a must
I lived in northern Norway for a little bit, and I am convinced that's how I got any sleep at all
For some reason I always see Europeans at reddit staunchly and stubbornly argue that people go topless all the time at European beaches, but I wouldn't even say it counts for 10% of women, not even 5%. You always see someone when in the south, but they are rare, and in Norway they are non-existent
There will be exactly zero topless women on regular beaches
But if you walk along the coast to more secluded places, or even on the many many small islands, you might stumble upon somebody enjoying the sun fully
Both topless and maybe also nude
His numbers was right  before cellphones got cameras, yours is right now, IMO
It varies a lot
Germany is the most naked nation on the planet, but it's difficult to give any estimations on the percentage
When I was a kid topless was more or less the norm in Spain
A lot of women were topless in Norway too
In my experience, Italy and France see little topless sunbathing nowadays
Spain is a lot more, but only on the beaches outside the vacation industry on the Mediterranean coast
Costa Brava has almost nothing, while Costa de la Luz has a lot
Topless swimming and sunbathing is on the increase in the Nordics at least, from virtually nothing to a few recent years
I've never seen a single women do that on any beach I've been to
So 0% is my experience
In norway pretty much none
Topless on your belly is quite common
Lego prizes are about the same, but wages are a lot higher
So LEGO is not considered super experience
But since it's very painful to step on a piece of LEGO, we still try to somewhat limit the amount
The massive millennium falcon is roughly €650, while larger creator sets are €100-€150
Median monthly salary before taxes was €4500 in 2019, which I guess would be around €3000 after income tax
>  I’ve never googled names of anyone I personally know, and expect the same of others
Is this normal behavior for a host family in Europe
I would definitely Google someone if they were to stay in my house
>  They then brought up the fact that they googled me and that search result of my parent’s death at a small gathering (several other German friends) while I was present
This is extremely rude, though
>  example: court records will appear in google searches
I do not think that is the case in Germany
Privacy is valued so theses things are not searchable online
They googled you because you were going to live with them
It makes total sense to me and I would absolutely do that
There would be no reason for them to feel embarrassed about it, because it’s not a weird thing
And our court records aren’t available, and I think the same goes for Germany(?)
**However** bringing up what they did and in that manner was not ok
First of all, bringing up someone’s dead parent is something that one should be very careful with
I can understand if they just wanted to let you know that they’re there for you, but then it should be done gently
And to bring it up in front of other people
What the hell
We respect privacy a lot, so if I found out this I would not tell other people or bring it up like that
I probably would not have brought it up at all and let you say it when you felt like it, if you did, unless I saw that you were struggling and thought you needed some support due to what had happened (and then I might not have said it directly, just tried to ask if you wanted to talk about something, it would depend a little on the situation)
Would I at least check out the person's facebook page
Yes I probably would
Especially if the person were to live in our house, being around my children for a while and so on
Would I ask about the person's parent's death while hanging out with a group of people
Most certainly not
That was just incredibly rude
I would *definitely* Google someone if I was gonna let them live with me for a year
I mean, if I found out they were racist or something I would never let them live with me
It seems like common sense to google them
I think it's a bit unfair to use Beowolf, as it's a highly poetic language
It makes Old English seem even more different than it was
Here's an easier text:
> Cnut cyning gret his arcebiscopas and his leod-biscopas and Þurcyl eorl and ealle his eorlas and ealne his þeodscype, tƿelfhynde and tƿyhynde, gehadode and læƿede, on Englalande freondlice
*Cnut, king, greets his archbishops and his lede'(people's)'-bishops and Thorkell, earl, and all his earls and all his peopleship, greater  and lesser, hooded and lewd(lay), in England friendly
This one is much more understandable
Early modern: with some difficulty
The most baffling bit is how the writer uses the word "wood" for
an army
Middle English: easy-peasy
"Wer" means "man" (as in werwolf), so "his lordes werre" must mean the lord's men
Old English: this is hard
I guess the text is about Grendel, and it's not a fan
Comparing him to Cain
No, I can't read this
The oldest English: About Norse gods
I think "Nu" means "now" (same in Danish), "fadur" means "father" ("fader" in oldfashioned Scandinavian), "eci" might be "not" ("ikke" in Norwegian), "barn" means "child" in Norwegian, "æfter" must mean "after" ("efter" in Danish), and "allmectig" certainly means "almighty" ("allmektig" in Norwegian)
The two first on the list went by very well
I think the only reason I can get through the old english one is because I live in a country where reading old norse is a part of school and my norwegian class teacher took that part very seriously
i can understand just about every word from early modern, middle and scottish english
but old is nearly impossible
The first one was something like "u lie, u die" the second one was "brave and good knight", third one was somerhing like this "æ".
Good thing they were warned by prophecy then, or they wouldn't have known something was wrong when a forest showed up on their doorstep
I suspect someone from Iceland miiiiight understand more of the old english one but I'm lost, could just get a word here or there
Written icelandic is very similar to old norse, so in theory it sounds like it should help
> Marzanna
Who was she historically
You do the bonfire to scare away witches too
And Norway
Ah ok, so not based on a real person
Oh you pagens
;) We do St
Hans as well
But no witch involved
It's celebrating the birth of John the babtist (who was born 6 months before Jesus)
No reason really
I had just never heard about this particular tradition before

Yeah I didn’t find the cafe con leche bit strange at all
It might be because I’ve travelled to Spain a fair bit, but I see cafe con leche as it’s own thing and it would be meaningless to say just «coffee with milk» which doesn’t sound very exciting at all
Is this an actual transcript
Haha okay
Sounds very Soviet
Oh dear god
Norwegianization attempts of the Sami and Kven peoples
How we treated war children after WW2
From Wikipedia: Between 10 000 and 12 000 children were born to Norwegian mothers with German partners during the occupation
After the war these women especially, but also their children, were mistreated in Norway
I think mistreating the women is one thing (and I don't believe they deserved to be mistreated), but mistreating the *children*? WTF
What did they do wrong
We have the sami people who live in the north, in the end of the 19th century the ethnic norwegian government decided it was a good idea to assimilate the sami people into norwegian culture
They had to go to norwegian boarding school where the teachers spoke norwegian, they were not allowed to speak their native language at all
This severely damaged the sami culture in Norway
Dont forget that we sterilizated the Roma population intill the 70’s.
This is madness
Viking stuff I guess
Well it started as an union with the marriage between the royals, and somewhere down that road the royals decided to just daneify the whole of it
The historical treatment of sami, romani, and gypsy peoples stand out
How jews were deported by willing Norwegian collaborators during WW2
The post-war treatment of girls who had fell in love with German soldiers (tyskertøsene)
The lack of support for the war veterans, in particular the war-time sailors of the trade fleet (krigsseilerene)
Well
Australia *is* better than USA
Gone wrong
sacrelidge norwegians only enjoys snus every 30 minutes
Damn
Glad i'm above average then
Last thing i do before bed
Bak en pris snus
The first thing in the morning after peeing and brushing teeth
Bak en pris snus
Yup, same in Norway
A Norwegian who doesn't know how to ski
I hate skiing
I’m a Norwegian that hates skiing

A Norwegian that doesnt like Brunost (Browncheese)
A norwegian that has never gone skiing
I am an Norwegian that is unintrested in cross country sking
I'm one of those few Norwegian that can't ski
I blame it on my Danish genes
Ooh, he might be me
No skiiing school trips
I can ski but i dont like it
But i like downhill
Though i'd say not liking kvikk lunsj is worse
No skiiing school trips
Alpine skiing is fun, but cross-country is the one ultimate Norwegian activity
I'm not saying that I don't know how to ski
It's the same in Stavanger, but people usually travel to Røldal or Sirdalen to ski
Have you heard abaout voss
Waterskiing
I had 2 week-long skiing trips to Røldal when i was taking the Sports-line in Sandnes highschool
I got okay at slalom
Mostly pizza - French fries - pizza - French fries
Got really good at falling without injuring myself though
I can't say the same as im a no
Skiier from nordland
I ... don't feel bad
As a Scando I read this with an accent that would be incomprehensible to any Portuguese or Spanish speaker
It's gotta be someone's kink somewhere, props to you for taking on that duty
Sola - feminine
Månen - masculine
In my dialect we say "solen", masculine, as we don't use feminine grammatical gender
*Sol* (sun) is feminine and *måne* (moon) is masculine
You can also refer back to them with gendered pronouns (she & he)
In norwegian Månen is masculine and Sola is feminine
But if its any sun, not ours, it can be masculine, "en sol".
In Norwegian the moon is masculine (månen=the moon) and the sun can be both feminine and masculine (solen/sola=the sun)
In Norwegian the sun is female: Ei sol - sola
The moon is male: En måne - månen
But probably most commonly the sun is reffered to as female
Sola is female
In norwegian you can use male article for female, but not the other way around, e.g. Ei jente / en jente
Swedish has genders though, the common gender and the neuter gender
There is also the feminine gender that still lives on in some dialects
I assume you are from Bergen
I am
I'm not just talking about feminine and masculine here
Swedish has two grammatical genders, common and neuter
The golden age of Norway is modern day Norway
It's hard to argue otherwise
Agreed
Independence, wealth, relative equality, peace, and even a decent amount of soft power
Yeah
I think the viking age was the last time before this that could in any way be considered a golden age
I went to tivoli, the amusement Park in the middle of Copenhagen and went on one of the rides
I thought it would be a laid back type of ride, like a kids ride, so I kept my phone in my pocket instead of leaving it
Turns out, the ride was not meant for kids and it started to do flips and all sorts
I heard a loud bang
That was my phone sliding out of my pocket, hitting the ground and going under the ride
I had to wait 2 months for them to find it and ship it back to where I live in Norway
Tldr; my phone went under an amusement ride and didn't have a phone for 2 months
Crossing the road is always a lot scarier in other european countries especially in Greece
[A truck loaded with] 27 metric tons of Norwegian brown cheese crashed in a tunnel in Norway, due to the high fat high sugar properties of the cheese it burned for 4 days straight closing the tunnel for a further week for repairs
This wasn't in my city, but in Oslo, a teen hit an old german lady with a waffle, yelling "Luftwaffel". But the teen was from a region called "Jæren" which I live in
So it kinda counts
That is hilarious
Thanks for sharing
...you guys have a profanity book
Because I would like to learn some more polish swearing
I actually bought my brother a rather large swearing lexicon with any known, and lots of less known, Norwegian swear words
It was hilarious to see our prudish step mom's face when he unwrapped it
I've stolen lots of fun things while drunk, but never a live animal
Let alone a lama, which is one of the coolest animals
I wish I were as awesome as these guys
You’d think so but the British ton is the long ton, which is 2240 pounds, and the U.S. ton is the short ton which is 2000 pounds
Both tons are actually defined in the same way
A metric ton, equal to 1000 kilograms, or approximately 2204 pounds
The metric ton is officially called tonne
According to gugl
How dare you mr surströmning

This might come in handy
He used the fruit tag to be able to scan it and place it in the bagging area like normal without causing extra suspicion in case someone were there
Though he probably did it when nobody was looking
A teenager buying a ps4 in the self checkout should make an employee take a closer look
Honestly, most of the southern/south-eastern coast of Norway is pretty beautiful too
From the area around Kristiansand at the southern tip and up east to around Larvik
It's pretty flat and doesn't have the same spectacular mountains of the fjords in the west, but in summer it's absolutely beautiful
You're from Arvidsjaur, right
So people in bigger cities are impolite
Sorry mate, not having it
I think I'll second this one
The most important language to learn would be the dominant language of the place where you intend to live
Aside from that, however, most places in western Europe you will get by incredibly well with English
So if you want to learn a language that will really open up new possibilities, then Russian will do that for you
>in the Nordics, there is (or was
) a tradition of leaving babies out in the cold
Do you mean just for sleeping
Because yeah, that is pretty common
At first when I read it, I thought you meant we killed babies by putting them outside in the snow or something, I certainly hope people don't think that
We also call it Gløgg
I saw Glühwein of white wine in Hungary, is that also a thing in Germany or would it be considered strange
Ditto in Norway
"Gløgg" can also mean smart/bright
Hey
We also hate them
Especially the Swedes
That's like us and the paper clip
We got roads with holes in too and roads just consisting of mud which probably haven’t seen any maintenance for decades
Its a sibling-type relationship
I will make fun of Sweden till the day I die, but damn you if you make fun of them
They're *my* annoying "big brother" to make fun of
I feel making a nazi joke to a German would just be
mean
Like, haha your past generation were super duper evil and so are you probably
No, dude, don't rub the salt in, Germany is great at teaching about their past wrongdoings, way better than most of us other Europeans (I mean I did learn of the discrimination and cultural genocide of the Sami, but could probably have learned more)
Also I really like Germany in general, and it's actually fantastic that it has kept its "Germanness" so well after what the nazis did to the country
Yep, I gotta agree with this
Hi hi
Kamelåså! Cracks me up every time
> no one in Scandinavia would call Finland Scandinavian
Because it isn't
Especially as written Norwegian is directly copied from written Danish then 3% adjusted to spoken language
(Don't mention nynorsk, let it die)
I had a discussion with my mom (who's born in Denmark) about this the other day, but we didn't really reach a conclusion: Why is it that danish, norwegian and swedish are considered three separate languages, instead of dialects of the same one
(especially danish and norwegian)
I do as well but I was wondering if it would upset some purists, or be seen at as how the Italians view putting ketchup on pasta
Never heard of Pat and Mat, but Krtek is(was) famous
Edit: and of course Three Wishes for Cinderella / Tři oříšky pro Popelku
Nynorsk is the best
It may not be a pretty language, but the Danish are definitely the most fun out of the Scandinavians
Your smallish city would be the second biggest in Norway lol
>Once I heard someone call French \*the Danish of romance languages\*
That actually makes sense in an odd way
Sweden getting all the credit, smh
No one notices Norway
We the uncool little brother of Scandinavia
Sweden is the popular girl, Denmark is the life of the party, and Norway is the little brother who saves all his pocket money and enjoys watching 134 hour live footage of Hurtigruten on the weekends
Ran out to the car to grab something my first winter in Skjellefteå with wet hair
It froze solid
I went to scrunch it, but thankfully someone stopped me in time
Norway is experiencing a bit of a "glowup" though
Maybe one day in the future we won't just be known as the sensible one
>Is it the way you pronounce it
The sound
The vocabulary
I'm probably not the best at explaining it, but it's mostly the former two
The sort of similarity with French would probably be mostly due to the tendency to not pronounce the end of words
Sure, we have *some* silent letters in Norwegian as well but not nearly to the same degree
But mainly it's just the way things are pronounced
If e.g. an Italian read a Danish word and the Norwegian equivalent I'd wager that they would in the majority of cases be far closer to correct pronunciation of the Norwegian word than the Danish
The vocabulary isn't anything special except the rare false friends that similar languages often have
E.g. to "Grine" means to laugh in Danish and to cry in Norwegian
If you want a short and actually linguistically accurate video on why Danish sounds funny to Scandinavians this is a good one:
Edit: they also have the same guttural R as the French and most Germans, which is uncommon in Norwegian, Swedish, and other romance languages than French
I don't really think French or Danish sound bad, just strange and a bit ...messy
If I read an Italian word my accent would be dreadful but at least I'd probably be understood, but if I had tried to pronounce Renault for the first time without being aware that it was a French word you'd hear both the L and the T
Denmark has been in the news a lot during the pandemic
And besudes that, everyone knows about Denmark
Buttercookies, Danish, Noma, Roskilde, vikings, Hans Christian Andersen, Lars Ulrich, Kristiania, lego, hygge, Carlsberg and Tuborg, Smørrebrød are all internationally known things about Denmark
No, your hair snaps
Its quite logical when you think about it
The guttural R is used by about 25% of Norwegians, so I wouldn't exactly call it uncommon
That would probably be the WW2 traitor [Quisling
] His name is used for a traitor to this day, not only in Norwegian but in several other countries as well
Anders Behring Breivik could also be a good answer to the question
2 contendants
1: Quisling
He was in charge of the country and served the nazis in WW2
A traitor
2: Breivik
He shot a bunch of teenagers at Utøya and detonated a bomb in Oslo
July 2011 is often looked at as the bighest tragedy in Norwegian history
Oh and also Hitler
First thing that popped up in my head was Vidkun Quisling, but as pointed out, Anders Behring Breivik is also a good contender to that dubious title
Yup those two are the worst, and the most hated
I remember reading about the foreign office in the UK replacing the picture of Margaret Thatcher with Cromwell, and the next day there was a delegation from the Irish government visiting
I assume that ended up in a fistfight
I saw "Death of Stalin" recently and I can't imagine there is much love for Beria
But he's maybe not that known
I'd also say Breivik, especially now
Most evil and fucked up person we've ever had
Shooting is a bit mild
Not quite
He has been sentenced to the harshest punishment in the Norway
And while that may seem like it's only 21 years in prison, he will not be automatically released after 21 years
When he has served his sentenced 21 years, he will be evaluated for release
If he is found to be too dangerous to be released, he will serve for up to another 5 years before he is evaluated again
If he is always found to be too dangerous to be released, he will live the rest of his life in prison
I doubt he will ever be released
Both because he probably won't be rehabilitated, and because he could be in danger from revenge killing if he were released
But if he were rehabilitated, and he could re-enter society without being killed in revenge, then I would not view it as a mockery of Norway
He would instead be a living monument of the success of our prison system, and our ability to forgive as a nation
(But again, this is not the most likely outcome)
Must have been some awesome pussy
Norwegian is not a very complicated writing-language (But remember that we have two and one of them is very unfamiliar to even most native norwegians)
When it comes to my specific dialect, it’s one even my norwegian friends have a hard time immitating, so I’d say that’s something you have to grow up speaking to know
That’s the case with the entire language(like every other language) people who have grown from childhood with the language are probably the only ones who have a shot at sounding like a native speaker out of non-natives
it depends, if you already speak english (as most people do these days) then it shouldn’t really be that hard to learn the grammar
same goes for most germanic languages
from any other language families i simply couldn’t say
pronounciation and verbal understanding is the tricky part
pronounciation because norwegian uses alot of different sounds that are uncommon in, for example, english
and in norwegian there are hundreds of different dialects who vary vastly from each other
so much so that it can be genuinely hard to understand what snother norwegian is saying depending on where they’re from
examples of three different dialects here:
[1]
[2]
[3]
Grammar is easy, but pronunciation can be difficult to learn natively
Norwegian is tonal unlike most European languages, its why Norwegian is often perceived as as a bit sing-songy
Every single word in Norwegian is realized with either one of two tones at the stress of the word
We would understand you if you mix them up, but its hard to sound like a native without using the right tone
It's almost impossible to sound "native" from here
Even people who are born and have grown up in Norway don't sound native if they have a parent who doesn't speak Norwegian fluently
It's really easy to hear from either their choice of words/structure, or their tone
Every dialect pronounces their words differently
F.ex
those in the east go very high at their sentences, while those in my city go down
It's super easy to tell, because dialects can be very hard to master as almost no words are pronounced as they're written unless you're from the Oslo-area and speak almost completely bokmål. The grammar isn't that hard, it's everything else that will get you caught
It's so much more fun bullying the swedes, though
Hasn't been much to make else to make jokes about either
Haven't heard anything new from Denmark since ca
the 17th century
Unlike the famous comedy powerhouse that is denmark
Especially now :) The current favorite here is "when the dumb swede jokes aren't jokes anymore"
Unlike most people here I would not like that
Many jobs need to be done 24/7 and this would require employers, the largest one being the state, to hire many more people at a much greater cost
This leaves less money for welfare which e.g. us in Norway already probably will reduce due to oil becoming superfluous
I'd like to thank Denmark for coming to our aid in the most desperate of times, selflessly offering supplies in our national tragedy known as "The butter crisis" so our temporary period of suffering from lack of buttery goodness due to shortages was one of merciful brevity
Thank you Denmark and Sweden for raising us into a good country, and being our sister countries
(And a little extra thanks to Sweden for dealing with us on out harryturer, we're sorry for the chaos we cause)
Thank you Finland for being the nicest people in the North <3
Thank you France, Spain and Italy for your delicious food
Thank you Singapore for *your* delicious food, and for the awesome time I had there during my studies
Thank you USA for your music and movies
Thank you Netherlands for being so chill in general
And an extra personal thank you to Mauritius for giving me a very fond little, but important piece of my childhood when me and my family lived there
Maybe a bit cliche, but thank you to everyone for not giving up during the 2nd world war
I don’t think any country could have won without another
Let’s never let a war amongst us happen again please:)
All the countries that fought Nazi Germany
Thanks
Russia gave us Svalbard
I understand Swedish like 100%, not a problem at all
Danish I understand very well after a few beers, and it's pretty easy while sober, too
Finnish is just as different to Scandinavian as Lebanese is, so I really don't understand any of that
Icelandic is pretty much "Greek to me".
We Norwegians are able to understand swedish people easily, but only the spoken language
Reading swedish is much harder for us
Denmark is the exact opposite, we are able to easily read danish, but its hard to understand what they’re saying as they sound like they have a potato stuck in their throat
I understand written Swedish: 65% Spoken: 85%
Written danish: 100% spoken: 60%, if they speak slowly: 70%
Daily/hourly
I never have to scroll far on any of the major news outlets before I see an article about the US
Yeah, it's about every day
But I actually don't mind that much
I think it's importent to know whats happening because of the relations Norway has to the US
We need to know if Trump are going to fuck us over or try to buy Svalbard or whatever
(I know it's not likely, but that guy is insane)
When thats said, I don't care for the never ending news stories about mean politicans, racism, sexism, gun violence etc
It just makes me really sad
Regular stream of stuff that happens in the US
Stuff like wildfires and pther disasters get a light coverage, and politics  bit more since it affects us so directly
Especially NATO stuff, trade stuff and US-Russia stuff
BLM had stuff and explenations and
stuff
Which makes sense, it gre international, and human rights developments abroad deserves a spot in ones' daily news, I think
Not something to limit to ones' borders
I primarily watch/read NRK (it's free and high quality
There is probably a lot more juicy drama from the news outlets that make money
Always
It started september 11 2001 and then never ever stopped
When the wars became old/dated the broadcasters just started to report on all random crazy shit from the states
I guess they found a source of news too valuable to let go
Hourly
It’s litreally everywhere, you just can’t escape it, and it’s so annoying
It’s gotten way worse since Trump became president, I can’t even watch the news anymore
Pisses me off how they need to talk about every little thing Trump does
The media here is way too USA centric, we hear way too much about them compared to other countries
Take hurricanes as an example, live streaming 2 weeks in advance and 2 months after, while when Japan or China were drowning in the worst downpours and storms in centuries it’s barely mentioned, barely anything about the drought in Germany and France or last time it was horrible flooding in Central Europe
It’s not his voice or face or anything it’s just that the media won’t shut up about him, when he isn’t even doing or saying anything relevant
I don’t even dislike Trump I just couldn’t care less about what some governer in a place I’ve never heard about thinks of him
I’ve no concrete answer to it, but I’ve thought a bit about it and come to a few points I personally mean might be leading
First as others have pointed out the US is one of the most important countries in the world because of its power so it’s often regarded as somewhat important whatever happens there
Second Norway is one of the closest allies of the US (or the other way around) and thus US politics and affairs are regarded as central to Norwegian affairs
Third Norway as a country is much centred around USA and American culture in a general especially since WW2, in some ways I find Norway closer to US than the rest of Europe often
We're a close US ally
The general secretary of NATO is Norwegian
We're a very Western country that consumes a lot of American media
There's a lot of interest
My impression is that it has always been like this, while other countries are regularly covered the US is often the centre piece
Trump or not, but he has got a lot of focus yes
Actually our media covers a lot from particularly UK, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Russia, Brazil, Turkey, Iran and China, especially national broadcaster NRK as they have active correspondents there, a few newspapers are quite good too (especially Aftenposten), it’s just that news and reportages from the USA are prioritised and put up front
Belarus has been widely covered here lately as well
We are still close to most European countries, I’ll say just as much as to the US, especially the other Nordic family members
This is my favorite sub on reddit - you're doing great
Even when things go haywire in r/europe I know people in this sub are usually still able to discuss things in a healthy and respectful manner
That's one of the things I worry about losing when r/askeurope grows larger, so thank you mods for trying to keep it that way
I agree with all of those overdone questions
They get brought up too often, without checking if it's been asked the previous 2 hours
I think it's great to not just have the same questions over and over again in this sub
It gets old quickly
In short: no
I don't.
More elaborately: There are many different cultures within Europe
There are different identities in a single country
For example today is "[Kvenfolkets dag] in Norway
I feel somewhat close to Danes, a bit to Swedes as well
But that's really it
I don't think there'll be a "European state/federation" while I live, we've already got the EU
>Do you believe that we can create a new Nation,a new "Superpower" just by agreements,good words and peace
Not sure about "superpower", for the other stuff: we've mostly got that with the EU and EEA
In the sake of feeling "European": not generally speaking
I firstly identify with my city (Bergen) and the my country
However, my American friends refer to me as their "European friend" and I don't correct them, because the few times I've don't that I've had to explain where the heck Norway even is on a map, so I'm fine just being referred to as their European friend
Like I do know I'm european, but I only really Identify by my country, we have alot of different cultures, so I don't really think europe has a common culture in that sence
When ut comes to 1 federation, no, I don't belive we will ever be that, again, ee identify alot more to our country here is my guess
When it comes to violence and stuff, I think it is very naive to belive that
It's a nice though, but I just have lost too mutch hope in humanity to belive that
We share somewhat of a bond, but not enough to call it a common identity
Imagine each country being a household, and Europe as a whole is the neighbourhood
The different families know each other decently well, they are friends, unlike the other neighbourhoods downtown (other continents)
However, they aren’t SUPER close, and it would not be a good idea for them to all live in the same house, like in your hypothetical scenario
You share a stronger sense of identity with your family than the people who just live next to you, y’know
This isn’t really a bad thing, it’s nice that we are unique and can live in different ways, while still keeping friendly relationships across the continent
Yes I do believe it exist, although I would have problems explaining it
If I bump into a French person in South Africa I will feel a closer connection to him, compared to another person I bump into from USA, Japan, Chile or another African country
In spite of the fact that the cultures of Norway and France are still fairly different
Yes, but only in the sense of an umbrella term of lesser importance
While it is foolish to think the people close to the borders of Europe don't relate more to the people on the other side of the border than to the other side of Europe, it is also foolish to deny any common European identity at all
It's there, just a bit vague
Never expected a nuanced and reasonable take to be top comment, what a positive surprise
In some areas of western Europe, every single generation for centuries (if not millennia) had in some way experienced war
Areas which now have been at peace for over 75 years
The EU is without a doubt a key factor in this
I agree
Though I feel closer to the Nordics and the Netherlands, and maybe Germany/Austria than most countries
That doesn't really reach as far as Spain and France, I can't say that I feel there are a lot of similarities between Spain and Norway at all culturally
Being "European" isn't apart of my identity generally
I don't know about that one
Norway has a really strong sence of being their own nation as a result ow being owned by sweeden and demark for 400 year
I don't think we will accept that one again
I'm sorry to dissepoint you, but I would probobly this of Mesopotamia as the cradle of western civilisation
But obviusly greece and rome is important for stuff as politics and so on
Yeah, I could defenetly agree on that one
Except for kalmar 2
Our history does not see those things as anything good
Even though some sweeds, mostly danes never belive that one, but you know, they write histiry on the victory side while norway write it as the loosing side
We even call it the 400 year night
From a Norwegian perspective,  Denmark is part of Continental Europe
The EU is not the democratic paradise you think of it as
Countrys like France and Germany does really have the biggest voice in the EU and can easly fuck up for the smaller ones
I am so glad Norway is only in the EUS
We are sutch a small country that we would never have any actual power when it comes to EU regulations, in the EUS we have the right to VETO
Now I think it was wrong of the UK to go out, but when it comes to ut, it depends on the country
Yeah, I think some sweeds signed it, but they went out of it after 1 year or something
While Norway who diden't sign it at all was forced into danish rule, our military wasen't strong enough to fight them
So we besicly went under danish rule before the danes lost to sweeden and norway was givene to you guys
We did have a 2 weeks war with you, but eventually lost
But that was farmers against professional military
Well, I really don't think its the right choice for norway
I am not talking about leaving the EUS or EEA if thats wat it's called, but joining the EU is right for norway
And we don't get orders from the US anyways
Again I do not think it was right of britain to go out
And I am not against the EU project, but we have so many resources that the EU would fuck up
Right now they can't tuch our fising and agriculture industry, though they have already affected the agriculture with us bot being allowed to plant norwegian stoneage plants I guess, that is far better for the norwegian topography and climate
But it's not really the most important one
But just to give you an examole of the fishing industry, in the EU zone, all the oceans are overfished, thats the reason we have so many foreign fishing boats here
But since we have strict regulations on fishing with quotas, we have had a substanable level of fish in the sea
It is important that it doesen't get ruined
Lofoten for example is the biggest breedeing place of cod in the world
If that was overfished, we could potentially extinguish the cod
That is not good
This is all because of certain EU regulations
And I really do belive Norway would be way better out of the EU, but still inside EUS or EEA or whatever it is called
That does not mean that I wan't the EU to be weekned
There is alot of countrys that would benefit of being in the EU, especially in eastern Europe, but the EU won't let them in because they are too poor, can't remember exactly which ones right now
We also have a really great relationship with the rest of western europe
We even chose our royal family because of Queen Maud who was a british prinsess
You know, to get protecton from britain (a bit naive though when you think of history)
But again, we do have a great relationship with western europe, and we like to decide for ourselfs, being a "colony" for 400 years kinda does that to you
I know London gets a lot of hate on Reddit, and while I love London I can see a lot of the criticism
Anyway, the single worst tourist trap I have ever been to is Madame Tussauds in London
Holy shit, it's the worst
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
The actual worst
It's not that interesting, it's filled with moronic people thinking that they're hilarious for doing whatever stupid ting posing next to the Queen
Not a destination, but people come to north Norway to see the midnight sun
Why
It's just daylight at night
Not much to see really, and besides it's often cloudy and rainy, so it will be dark-ish anyway
Sure it might be special for someone who has never seen it before, but if you haven't seen it before, you are not exactly missing out
I did a biking trip along the Donau and stayed 2 nights in Bratislava
I honestly fell in love with the city and am eager to go back some day
I see what you’re getting at; Bratislava isn’t a city with many tourist attractions, venues or astounding nature, but it’s just very cosy in a way
A really nice city if you enjoy casually strolling through the streets and drink Zlaty bazant :)
Please say more
Im planning on going to the Netherlands/Amsterdam when its safe again, tell me more
Very famous clock
Very famous spire

I’m from Norway and I would say Sweden ...Also Denmark, but mostly Sweden
Sweeden
Sometimes Denmark and Finland
We have a rivalry with Denmark and Finland about who's the biggest rival of Sweden
Sweden
Swede jokes are super common, jokes where we make fun of swedes
Denmark and Sweden is not any competition so I guess
Finland
You never feel more hurt and ignored than when your rival country Sweden say their rival country is Denmark
Pffft like you ever had a chance in skiing
I live on the south coast of Norway
We see Denmark as our (holiday-)friend
Although this year seems to be a bad one for our usual Denmark holiday filled with lots and lots of hygge
Finland
Have you heard the joke about the Norwegian, Swede, Dane and Finn
Nope
Only he Norwegian, Swede and Dane
(Although I cannot remember a single one right now
I feel like every Norwegian either likes Sweden and dislikes Denmark, or likes Denmark and dislike Sweden
Majority hates Sweden though
We need someone to take second place in skiing so we can keep swimming in all our gold medals you know
Denmark was way longer than Sweden, some 500 years almost
Under Sweden we only stayed for roughly 100 years, and had a lot more autonomy than under Danish rule
I still prefer Denmark over Sweden you know
If you make good akevitt you are my friends
It is hard to have Iceland as a rival
You guys are cool
I have some Icelandic friends, I like to call them reserve Norwegians, if that helps
If Norway is a sourdough bread, Iceland is the yeast starter we save in case we need  more bread
Thought this question was about sports and stuff tho
No, were not serious, søta bror
In public we hate you
In secret we love you
(But you won't catch us saying it out loud
No worries we still love our sibling
We just can’t stand you at all, not even for a second
At least we’re the hotter sibling
Stockholm is beautiful and all, but your country is a giant forest man, go hang out with Congo smh
Jk love you guys
Yeah, not serious at all
But please open borders after corona, we want to go in to buy stuff
Norway is tiny too
But, Faroe islands, they seem a bit dickish
Happened here in Norway a few weeks ago
It will now be renamed to Lake Blood
Gran Canaria
I love spain but gran canaria is packed with tourists all year
I prefer places like rural towns outside Valencia
Geiranger
Too many people squeezed into one small area, lots of cruise ships spewing out CO2, people even walking on top of graveyards even
There are far more appealing areas that is just outside Geiranger that is far more empty from people
I agree
I also read all of your answer here, and nobody mentioned what is most important to me
Why would any woman go willingly to a place where she is considered a second-class citizen
As a woman, in Dubai any man's word is considered more valid than mine, and I could go to jail for getting raped
(yes, that has happened, although not to me
The point is to smoke good quality weed in the open while drinking a nice milkshake
I can't do that in Norway
Only been there once, though
Says Mr
Rotterdam ;)
Something that I haven't seen any Scandinavians mention yet:
The word 'rar', which means 'weird' in Norwegian, but - from what I understand - means 'sweet' in Swedish
Norwegian and English has quite a few:
EN - NO
Fart means speed
Smell means impact (it's an onomatopea, kinda like "bang")
(which leads to the funny phrase: "it's not the fart that kills, it's the smell")
Hell means luck (which is why there's a town called Hell in Norway)
Crap (/Krapp) means a sharp (as in a sharp turn)
Pig (/pigg) means spike
There are many many more
We in Norway have the famous sentence: it’s not the fart that kills you, it’s the smell
Fart is speed and smell is impact
Also rape means burp
Norwegian: Bolle = bun, like the simple pastry
Danish: Bolle = to fuck
Dog can also be used in Norwegian, although you basically never hear it
You can say: Jeg liker all mat, dog ikke fisk(I like all food, but not fish)
What you will more commonly hear is: jeg liker all mat, **men** ikke fisk
Same sentence basically
Norwegian "rape" = to burp
Unless its a snusdåse
But it works in Norwegian
Where what you drink from is written glass like the ice cream in Swedish
aw well now it's not as funny :(
My only complaint is that the summers are getting too warm
I'm happy living here and probably won't move permanently anywhere, but I wouldn't mind living abroad for a year or two just for the experience
I like it
I wouldn't move unless something drastic happened
Its perfect atm nice weather summer, i would only consider a semester or two in the uk
I really like the security I have here, but I really want to move away for a couple of years just to experience a culture that isn't so
One-sided
A lot of immigrants really struggle to assimilate here because of [the Jante Law] and the "do not stand out"-culture that we have
It's hard to get new friends because you're not supposed to talk to others unless you know them from before
Therefore, Norway isn't just cold weather-wise
But yeah, I would like to move somewhere else for my Master's degree after I'm done with my Bachelor
It will probably be somewhere in West Europe like Germany or UK just because I know the languages and cultures
And the winters are lacking snow
We're hitting 30 at the moment, combine that with most people not having A/C and our houses being built for staying warm, shit's unbearable xD But we musn't complain, don't want the wrath of the gods do we :D
It's amazing to be honest
Great neighbours, except for well Russia but they barely border us and up in a place no one really lives
Also amazing landscape and scenery, massive coastline which is great for fishing etc
Also a country with 4 proper seasons, summers are nice and winters are lovely up in the mountains
My only complaint is that it sometimes feels a little far away from stuff
Opposed to living in say Amsterdam/Prague/Zurich just to take an example when you're just a relatively short train ride away from so many different countries and famous cities
Here you kinda have to fly to really get somewhere
But overall it isn't bad, I can't really complain at all
I love it, but theres one MASSIVE drawback
It's sooo cooold
I hate it
I love the nature and all but i hate the weather
It's to dark during the winter and to damn bright during summer
It rains to much and i would like summers with much more summer weather
Northern brethren
>Unfortunate neighbor
i know what you mean
Ah, the beautiful four seasons I have in Bergen
Rain, warmer rain, wind and rain, and colder rain
> up in a place no one really lives
\*Angry Finnmark noises\*
Kinda hard to say “it’s worth it” if you’re living in an autocratic state which jails journalists and goes more authoritarian by the day
A truly democratic rule-of-law Turkey would be amazing, however
Oooh, please don't use the ø that way
It looks like you are writing fjœrd, lol
You don't often read about your case: Nordics to Central Europe, so I'm curious
Why does it feel more correct
I assume atmosphere, people (more social
), maybe food
In all these examples or any other one, what is the differing factor that makes Central Europe more correct for you
You grew up in Norway, until you were old enough to move out, and you moved to Czechia
I dont really see how that makes sense
Work related
Or just feeling like it was better for you, if so, can you explain
I’m a Norwegian guy who’ve dreamt about moving to Central Europe for years, more precisely Austria or Germany, especially Vienna or Munich
It’s just that life in the Norwegian countryside/suburb to me is dull, I can’t connect with people, it’s directly antisocial
I would feel more at home there, things seems to be always correct, people seem to be more mindful and reflected
I just feel hidden away up here, locked up without possibilities
Norway is in many ways a cultural development country, especially if you aren’t lucky enough to live in Oslo

My mom got my great grandfathers old lada when he got a new one, and she got her licence
He was a cool man, lost one finger to the zee
I think the car was brought from russia to norway in a fishboat, tho, not necessarily legally
They were fairly popular in Norway during the early '80s and the brand had a market share of 3,5% in 1981 (at its peak)
They pulled out of Norway in 1997 though and I have never seen any more recent "grey market" models here
There is a song "for vi kjører granada jada det ekje noke lada" or we drive a granada yes it aint no lada
I remember that my uncle used to have one back in the 80s. From what I can find out online, they were fairly popular in the 70s and 80s due to being cheaper than most other cars
Changes in the tax regime meant that they became more expensive relative to their competitors, and there hasn't been any official imports since 2002
Same in Norway
Lada was the punch line in all of the "bad car" jokes in the 80's and 90's.
A few can still be seen on the roads now and then, but they aren't exactly common
In Norway the importer, Konela, gave you lots of options such as sunroofs and even bodykits
They even sold a tiny amount of performance versions with turbos
From my understanding these were actually really good (considering it's a Lada), and on par with the Golf 3
Never droven one myself, but would love to
I still see some from time to time
True that
I doubt they sold really any at all outside of the Nordics
A old norwegian guy had spent a little too mutch time traveling and tried to hagger the price of a plant in the flower shop I worked in
I told him no, in norway its disrespectfull to try to hagger for a lover price in stores he was norwegian so he knew better
"But in other countrys is commen to hagger the price down
"Well, thats not how we do it in norway
Then he proceded to say "I can get if for half the price in the food store"
Me; "then go buy it from the food store
But don’t come and ask for adwice when the plant die after 2 weeks/have rot/pests
There is a reason a Flower shop is more expensive just like there is a reason the baker have more expencive bread than the regular food store
My boss thought the customer was rude and as she said "he always create problems when he come, haggering the price, spend 30 -45 min of our time and then don’t buy anything etc" both my boss and coworkers thought my response was funny, as we had to deal with him often
You could forgive a foreigner for not knowing the shop dynamic in Norway, but a native norwegian
Comon, its not that hard
In Norway we have seatbelts in the bus as well
But alot of people dont bother to use it even though they could get 500 dollar fines for not using a seatbelt
I had no idea Italians don't like wearing seat belts
Do more ppl die in traffic there I wonder
Your friend should have taken better care of you
Told you to come all the way in, keep your shoes on and so on
Their bad, not yours
Not taking off shoes would be a big no-no in Norway
I wish every mechanic was like that
Probably more fun work for them, and my car would become more unique for each repair
Now I am confused
Is light-beer a low calorie beer, a low alcohol beer or light in colour, like a pilsner
In Norway a light beer would be non-alcoholic and a lite beer low calorie
A pilsner is
beer
When do people normally go to bed
(And when do children go to bed
you don't do pre-parties before going out
I know
Very surprising that other countries don't see the need for it
To add to that: even when we say don't worry about wearing shoes on inside, always ask "Are you sure
" might be a politeness thing not to inconvenience the person
Don't you get fines for not wearing them
Like this in Norway too and I am almost completely sure it's the same in Sweden
No wonder why you are so healthy down there
You go hours between meals
But when do your kids sleep
Here people put the kids to bed between 19-21ish depending on their age
Agree, even though going out is cheap enough (I lived in poland for 6 months and it doesnt get cheaper than that), its still nice to be at someone’s place before going out
This is true
Ah ok
I understand
Maybe he's one of the spanish people from a reply further up, and dinner time to him is 21:30
Dinner is whenever you eat dinner, you act like your way of doing it is like some holy unbreakable rule lol
Most are when you think about it
Most are about killing, wolfs and trolls eating children, and so on
The exception might be about Per, Pål and Askeladden all trying to get the princess and other stories like that
Yeah pretty much all of the old adventures are horrible
We have our own version of Grimm brothers, Asbjørnsen and Moe
Lots of children getting eaten or burned
The most common punishment the king would inflict on advenutrers that fail in their quests would be a branding iron or having the skin on their backs peeled of and rubbed with salt
Lots of little girls getting abducted by trolls or giant beasts to be their wives
Here in Norway we have several stories about trolls involving gore and  murder
The one story I remember best is where a little boy is having an  eating competition with a big troll, and he convinces the troll to cut  open his stomach so he can eat more than the boy
This of course kills  the troll, and the boy then steals the dead troll's treasure
I remember having a nightmare as a kid where a troll kidnapped me to her underground laboratory to chop of my arms with a chainsaw, because she was using human limbs and body parts on her robots to make them better
Maybe some of the troll stories scared me more than I remember
Askeladden som kappåt med trollet is a bit nasty tho
About Askeladden, or Ashlad as he's called in the english translations, had an eating competition with a troll
He put his backpack on in front as trolls have poor eyesight, and filled the backpack with most of the porridge
When the backpack was full, he took out his knife and sliced the backpack open so the porridge poured out
Then he said "there, now I can eat as much as I want without feeling full
" the troll then thought he had actually sliced his stomach open and asked "does that really work
" to which Ashlad said "of course
Why dont you try it yourself
".. The troll didnt want to lose the competition, so he took his knife and cut his guts open, bled out and died
Then Ashlad was able to take all the riches he wanted and lived happily ever after
There are some local stories about the underwordly, vetter and Huldra
One story we were told as kids was about a girl who was kidnapped by Huldra while her parents were in church
To get her back they had to drag the freaking church bell into the mountain and chime
The end of the story is that it didn't help
One night she visited her grandma and told her she would have been released it they had chimed just once more, but she has to go to the underworld forever now
Lille Hoa Hottentott would like a word
Haha this is the exact version I was read to when I was a child
And that's the only time I heard the story where Rapunzel had a Norwegian translated name: Kjørvel (it's a cool word, but not as a name, so I understand why it didn't last)
I forgot about that one
I do remember thoroughly enjoying the story as a kid though
Never heard that one
It was oddly one of my favorite Askeladden stories when I was a kid
My parents have a big collection of all the Per, Pål og Espen Askeladd stories
And all the Grimm stories, all the H.C Andersen
Uhm, just about every collection of old myths, fairytales and stories there is to find in this part of the world
I never lacked reading materials
I think it's local to my hometown, or area
US way of using 'Liberals' and 'Conservatives' makes little sense in Europe
They also use opposite colours (left is blue and right is red), which adds to the confusion
"Shame". Can (in South Africa) be used about anything cute, sad, nice, bad
Very confusing for the rest of us
(However my South African husband never uses it much, but his sister in law on the other hand
Every other sentence
He says cheers a lot though
But only when speaking English
Edit: I forgot - "I'm coming now" which never, ever, means that you are coming now
[Ever
In Norway we tend to view the left as being conservative *("averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values")*, and the right as more liberal *("willing to respect or accept behaviour or opinions different from one's own; open to new ideas")
How did a South African end up in Finland
If I may ask
:) I would think some would avoid it due to language
(I love Finland personally, but also find the language beyond difficult)
Especially when "just now" turns out to be more than half an hour
> Finland is amazing for quality of life
Yes, one of the best in the world
And Finns make great friends ones you get to know them
Happy you were able to escape
And sad that South Africa seem to go downhill
I hope things will eventually turn for the better
Thought so, then I moved and realized it's just me
I used to think that way
Then I travelled around and spent some time abroad and I come to the realisation that I was Norwegian through and through and come to appreciate many aspects of "Norwegian way of life".
I think this is somewhat common for people moving to the Nordic
We are not exactly the most including kind of people
I recently saw a documentary about an African guy who runs a successful hair salon somewhere in Denmark
He felt that no matter how successful he became, people would still just assume he sold drugs for a living because of him driving a really nice car
I believe his experience would have been similar if he lived in Norway
Racism here is somewhat subtle, but still very much present
Casual drinking during the week (ie: a little something in your glass for dinner, a relaxing beer after a long day at work) is blasphemous (THINK OF THE CHILDREN
), and don't even get started on drinking during the holidays (there's a whole ad campaign throughout December imploring parents to think of their wee little ones)
*But*.....
Weekends are fair game
At the start of the evening, you'll usually hang at some mates house slugging beer and singing Tore Tang very loudly and badly
And at the end of the night you'll often find yourself at some random strangers house for an after party, again singing Tore Tang very loudly and badly
And as for the middle bit, as alcohol is so expensive, if you're going to invest on getting a buzz, you might as well get paralitic (also, that way you can work up the nerve to take home Karin from accounting home for a shag
If that goes well, *maybe* you'll work up the nerve to ask her out)
And I mean, fucking paralitic
That straight laced colleague of yours is *for sure* necking a pint of overpriced wine at 7am at the airport while waiting for her flight to Alicante
I mean, shes on holiday after all
During the summer holidays it is permitted to enjoy alcohol in a normal manner (ie, something in the glass for dinner, a relaxing beer after anlong day)
Its summer, so fuck the kids
And that's how it goes, week in, week out
At least here in the bible belt of Norway
You either don't drink or you get drunk
The notion that you can have a glass of wine with dinner and that is it, is a rather new thing up here
And some don't drink at all - as in never
Which I guess is a kind of reaction to the binge drinking
Some would say its because they are Christian believers
But we all know Jesus drank wine
And he even frequently hung out with ordinary people in the pub
There is a saying coming from south of Stavanger: "We know Jesus drank alcohol, but that doesn't mean we need to like it
Norway, a land where alcohol was prohibited for a while, and since has been frowned upon
Pietistic religion has been seen as a good reason for being anti alcoholic
Being visibly tipsy is also seen as a bad thing by some
We have not had a real culture around alcohol as a normal thing to drink at a meal or recreationally in the evening, but there's a huge culture based around drinking your brains (and guts) out in the weekends
It’s not looked down upon by the majority and it’s pretty normal to get drunk now and then
Pretty sure snaps is a Danish thing
More common among young people, yes, but if it wasn't for covid I could definitively gather a group of friends to get properly drunk if I wished to
Norway genuinely has such an unhealthy binge drinking culture
This is probably not representative for Poland as a whole, but I visited Katowice some years back and was surprised how drunk people were
I thought Norway had a hardcore drinking culture
But here, people were sleeping on the tables, stumbling around
I was also surprised how relaxed the bouncers were
Also a lot of people were on MDMA
You got a point
Italians have no reason to become drunk every weekend
So all Nordics just like our beer then
And sometimes our shots/drinks
Sometimes our wine
And only very occasionally our snaps
In Scandinavian languages the word is "snaps". Akevitt/aquavit is the most common one here, but there are others
Yeah I had a great time in Poland for sure
Underrated travel destination
Amusingly, "eau-de-vie" and "akevitt" have the same origin
Aqua vitae, the water of life
Hand disinfectant is under "drinks", clearly
And cider is basically wine
Poverty
Norway was a pretty poor country until someone found oil offshore and the government decided that we should share the profits in a national pension fund
Now there are very few actual poor people, those who are, have probably fallen between chairs in our great social welfare system
That is so interesting
When did they stop doing this
The opposite Norway, here we have signs that says that drivers should watch out for the children playing
I don't know, I don't pay much attention to that discussion
The welfare fund is pretty damn I don't plan on living much more than 40 more years, so I believe I'm set for life
Per today the fund is valued at 11,000 billion Norwegian Kroner (1280 billion USD) and growing
Why
If you know
My children had skiing day at school last week
They were thrilled
Last year we had no snow, so it was 2 years since last time
So all the skis and shoes from then had become too small
But in 2019 Norway started "sporting gear libraries" in many towns ("BUA")
So this year for the first time we could borrow everything they needed from there
The kids had lots of fun
Seems like the snow is staying for a bit so we might go skiing in the weekend as well
Well, they are iconic
So in a way I get it
Ah ok
I had no idea there was a difference
Well, this is only 1,5 years old here
So the trend might spread to other countries
It's a great way to try out a sport to see if you like it
Or for children who constantly grow and need a different size
Lots of people waiting in line when we were there last - my guess is that lots of schools do skiing day now while the snow is here
As a general rule, Billboards along roads are **not legal in Norway**, unless it's  part of the building it advertises (like a gas station sign)
No, we have the freedom _from_ this type of shit
Real freedom
I don't mean to criticise Christians as a group, but it's kind of typical of a certain kind of Christians to put up a billboard asserting that there's evidence for the existence of God, instead of presenting the actual evidence
Over here we just nail our religious opinions to church doors and spark religious reform revolutions
Being Jewish
Never had to worry
Just have to laugh at the thought of people praising Jesus
I think billboards are unusual
At least as stand-alone things along the high-way
There are ads on walls, etc, though
But I have never seen one with a religious message on
That is really not pretty
It is our road safety law which makes these billboards illegal
The reason is that they are distracting
Juxtaposed with those beautiful mountains that looks downright dystopian
Haha
We still have ads on pedestrian areas, but exploitative, discriminating and offensive ads are illegal
Danish, Swedish, Faroese and Icelandic
In that order where Danish is the easiest to read and Icelandic the most difficult
[Potato language]
Danish
It's written almost exactly the same as norwegian, but it sounds like someone threw up in a lexicon and made it a language
Danish is very easy to read beacuse our writing is extremly simmilar, if you are reading Danish without knowing it might actually take some time before you realise it
But it’s impossible to understand what they are saying most of the time
Swedish is pretty balanced between writing and speaking it
We can read it pretty well (not as good as Danish) but we understand and can speak it much better than we can with Danish
Danish and sweedish I suppose
Danish is almost indentical to written norwegian bokmål and sweedish is simelar enough to be understandeble, plus we grew up with sweedish kids shows
When I studied language history in uni, I read that apart from Swedish and Danish, Dutch is actually the easiest language to learn for us Norwegians
A lot of words are only used in Dutch and Norwegian, like rar(NO) / raar (NL)
Both countries are small and have relatively little cultural exchange with each other in modern times, so I guess that’s common knowledge only to linguists nowadays
You dont understand Norwegian and Swedish when it's spoken
Well you speak english
Try listening to the Scots language
It's as close to English as Swedish is to Norwegian I'd say
Written Danish and written Norwegian are basically the same language
Danish is just a lot more conservative and has the world’s weirdest comma placements
Not nynorsk
They are in fact very similar
Especially Norwegian and Danish
Yeah, they are very close
We’re both coastal nations that once had a huge fleet
That’s probably why
I previously worked for EVRY (now TietoEvry) and when we started that had this program for all new employees just out of university from Norway and Sweden
I remember the Swedes not being able to understand us, but we understood them without that much difficulty
Probably because we grew up watching Emil, Pippi and Saltkråkan etc
Yep
They make no sense what so ever
I want to write something sarcastic about having two systems, but we’ve got two written languages ffs
Norwegian rules are pretty similar to English
In Norwegian we separate between helsetning and leddsetning
If you combine the two without a period, you’ll use comma
That’s the general rule
The rule most people use, which in most cases are correct, is that you put a comma where there is a natural pause
«Jens likte ikke grovbrød KOMMA men han elsket loff»
"lieu" most likely derives from *locus
*  In Italian the equivalent would be "luogo". Kinda surprised you didn't catch it
Yeah, I don't speak bokmål (nobody does, it's a written language, but I get your point)
My dialect is from the west coast
This makes it harder for Swedes to understand, but most Swedes who has been a little bit exposed to Norwegian can understand me
Skiing
You wouldn't think that because of global warming, but Norway haven't had so much snow in 60 years as this year
Stryn summer ski center had to delay the opening until 5th of june due to heavy snowfall with 1 meter of snow this weekend
I remember not 2 weeks into my stay in Hungary my landlord was at the door with 6L of homemade wine in naturaqua bottles
I was skeptical at first, but man it tasted great
If you go north from Germany and end up with bad bread you stopped too soon
I should've been Spanish
Then I could also attend Barcelona matches weekly
> but Norway haven't had so much snow in 60 years as this year
Depends on where in Norway you live though
No skiing down here this winter
(Kristiansand)
we had like two days of snow in Fredrikstad this year
ey Fredrikstad gang
Gas station bacon-wrapped hot dog filled with cheese, standard roadtrip food
Nothing else really comes to mind
Frozen Pizza
Oh yes, a [baconpølse] can be delicious
But don't forget our [baked potatoes] It's the toppings that make it great, with sour cream, garlic and herb butter, corn, bacon/ham and shredded cheese
And some people treat [boller] almost as a fast food
Also waffles
(vaffler) Might I even venture to say fleskepannekaker
(bacon pancakes)
Plus we can't really deny our late night kebabs when we go out drinking
edit
also brunost på knekkebrød. (brown cheese on dried bread
Damn this reminded me of that it's way too long since I last had baked potato, maybe have to make some for the weekend
Everyone in Norway have flags, and wave it every year
Take a look at [this] Google image search
This is how all of norway looks like every year at May 17 (except this year and during WWII)
It's actually uncommon to not own a flag in Norway
Everyone owns at least one flag
To me, Constitution day (our national day) is one of the prettiest and happiest days of the year, and the flags really add to it
Here's a picture from the celebrations in Oslo:
Don't you flag for public holidays
Hold on, I think I can translate it to Norwegian: Vimpel
Yes, I thought that was everywhere
Here, that's kind of what flags are for: a sort of party decoration
We use it for private celebrations too, like birthdays
Edit: And boats, for some reason
My man we have [a whole holiday] specifically for flagging
Understandable
I hope that taint will subside though; you have a lot to be proud of too
Why do you sing "Happy Birthday" - to remind people to be happy
Like singing, flying a flag is a way to mark a special occasion
All countries do it, here private citizens do it as well
Regarding immigrants, I think it makes more sense to fly the flag of the country you've actively chosen to live in
But that's up to them, of course
I don't see many foreign flags though
You're not born with any ownership of your culture, but you gain it as you get older and more immersed in it
I assume you know more than I do about German literature, and history, philosophy, etc
Then that belongs to you, and that's something to be proud of
You can learn those things without being born in Germany, of course, and that wouldn't make any difference
If an immigrant is proud to be German, that's just as it should be
But it's probably not so easy to pick up a culture without living in it
You don't necessarily have to *feel* ownership anyway, in some ways your culture just shapes you whether you want it to or not
To some extent, your culture is part of you
It's not really about achievements, but the qualities that are incorporated in your own personality because you've been raised in Germany
Literature, philosophy, etc
changes you, mostly for the better
And less obvious traits of your culture change you too
And yes, those who grew up in DDR probably are a little different from you
But we're all much more than just our cultures, of course
Has to be [the king taking the tram during the oil crisis in 1973]
[This comes to mind]
It's in the immediate aftermath of the bomb that hit the government building 22nd of July 2011
[This is from Utøya a few hours later] where the terror attack continued after the bomb went off
> My personal favorite is a collection of photos by Bruno Barbey that shows Poland during the 80s.
Love these photos
Thanks for sharing
For context: he was going cross-country skiing in the woodlands outside Oslo, as he often did during winter
Normally he would be driven by chauffeur to wherever the tracks start, but during the oil crisis this seemed unsolidaric with the common people who were restricted from driving their own cars, so he took public transport on this one occasion
He also had a single bodyguard attending him, but this person wound up outside the photo
There is a reason why he got called The People’s King
I few years ago I was on the same flight as the Queen of Norway
And once I bumped into the crown princess while she was shopping in Kristiansand
Security guards in toll of course, but nice to see them do the same things as us commoners
Was expecting Churchill doing the V-sign, honestly
The one showing the ticket is Olav V, the current king's father
Yep
She sat down there without realizing it was the king already sitting there
He was such a nice King
They say that on Christmas eve, he personally walked out to the guards on duty and poured them a glass of cognac and gave them a cigar because he thought everyone should have some hygge that night
Sorry to ruin the fun, but she apparently hated how famous it got
She killed herself a few years after
Although I suppose the photo wasn't the only reason
They're all called Haakon, Harald, Olav, Magnus or Sverre
Still waiting for one to be named Odin
No Norwegian kings have been named Håkon
There have been 7 (soon to be eight) named Haakon though
Fun
Looks like a lot of traffic though
Anyone planning to take that photo, should have to do it early in the morning mid summer
Preferably on a holiday
Sure we have
We've only had one Haakon
Then a bunch named *Hákon* or similar in Old and Middle Norwegian
"Håkon" if you modernise
>In my case it's the absurd prices of mobile data
Haha same here
249kr (~25 euro) a month for 5 GB data
Houses are really expensive if you want to live within a reasonable distance from any city centre
Also, any decent meat is very expensive and the general selection of ingredients is pretty poor
Probably the cost of living
Admittedly, wages are high in Norway, but we have a lot of taxation on specific items, like alcohol, tobacco, petrol and cars
Luckily, I don't smoke, drink or own a car, but I still find some of the taxation to be too high
This was somewhat pain free for my children
My eldest already had a chrome book from school, and was used to the technology
So he could help show the younger sibling how to do it
The younger one could have borrowed a laptop from school, but they were able to use their Samsung pad, which we could attach a keyboard to
They both quickly learned how to do online meetings with the teacher and class, and share all documents back and forth to and from the teacher
So I would say all in all the transition to home schooling was quite pain free both for teachers, parents and school children
So the biggest challenge was really that I as a parent had to quickly become a part time teacher
But after the first week I started to enjoy it
>  I’m already having anxiety for how to solve this
Rent for a while
This is pretty true for getting a job here too, at least part time/low skill jobs
I applied for so many jobs as a teenager and I have had exactly *one* job, which i got through a friend
Is it snobbery or is it because you have more of a class system that makes the upper class or the rich/wannabes dickish
That is the one thing that feels a bit strange to me as a Norwegian when I am in London
It makes me uncomfortable being called sir by a person working at a hotel, restaurant or shop etc
Because then as a Norwegian I feel I have to be formal too and call them sir
Because I grew up in a society with no classes, I am no more "sir" than the person saying sir
It just makes the situation awkward
The UK do have the opposite of snobbery though
At a corner shop or pub, an older woman serving you might say "There you go, luv". How beautiful is that
That is a surprise
In all the photos of the Netherlands there are never a single candy wrapping laying around
Snus also is crazy expensive in Canada from what I read at r/snus
What is the average pay for a Canadian worker, if I may ask
That sounds luxurious
> The huge problem here is that getting a first hand contract in for example Stockholm takes years, or in worst case even decades
I had no idea
Maybe you need to apply for a job in Oslo
Rent is high
But so are salaries
Thank you for replying, those numbers are quite good imo
It is higher here but then again we pay 25% tax on almost anything, after a 36% income tax deduction
Because it was huge news globally at the time
Everyone knew who he was, since he'd won the Nobel peace prize not long before
(Especially here in Norway, of course, because we're the ones who award the Nobel peace prize and obviously because of the Oslo Accords that preceded it, but this was all pretty well-known all across Europe)
Two of my grandmother's brothers were killed in WW2
The third brother felt so shameful that he wasn't able to keep his brothers safe that he went to the US after the war and worked for 10 years
His family never heard from him during this time, so they didn't know whether he was alive or not
Imagine the joy when he one day in 1955 stood outside his parents house
My grandmother talked about it often
But he had to deal with war trauma for the rest of his life
My one grandfather served in the army and was deployed to Germany after the war
His memories from his stay there was good though
My other grandfather was a sailor and his ship had to hide under some mountain sticking out to avoid being bombed
Growing up with these stories make the war not feel so far away
And let us never forget, and never repeat
I have German and American friends
Watching WW2 movies together is a bit akward
I'm just really glad most of our spat are resolved online now
It dosen't feel strange to me but it feels strange to my great grandfather who is still alive at the age of 97
He still feels a certain way about Germany to this very day because of what my great grandmother went through during WW2
She was the same age as my great grandfather
Her dad was killed after German soliders shot down his fishing boat
We still don't know why it happened
Her mom died in her sleep a few weeks after
My great grandmother was 16 and alone with 3 younger siblings to raise and a farm to take care off
Now in 2021 the island we live on have become the suburbs
Back in the day it was just farming land
Fantastic album
Really brings a knot to my stomach
Let's not do that again
Edit: While we don't have bullet holes around here, we do have the [DORA bunker] A good old submarine bunker with several meters thick concrete walls
After the war the locals really wanted to get rid of it, but there was no feasible way to do it safely
So since then it's been repurposed as a national archive, with historical records, medical records, huge server parks etc
There's also go-kart and bowling in there
Good day to you very very eastern Norwegian
Don't compare us to northern Germany
We use *favn*, fathom in English, to measure volume of firewood
2m x 2m x 0
6m, or 2
40m^3
Edit: fixed numbers
For quite some time "Mong" was used as an unofficial (and humorous) money unit in Norwegian news papers
One Mong equalled around 4 bn NOK, which was the first signaled budget overrun on the building of the Mongstad oil refinery (the overrun actually ended around 6 bn)
I think we had something special but I don’t remember what it was, maybe about mil/miles or something
Until the 18th century “alen” was a commonly used measurement
It was the length from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger
In earlier times it was about 50cm, but in the 15th/16th century it was changed to about 60cm
It is not used anymore, but Jan be found in the national anthem
We use _mil_ in Norway too
It's the most common way to give distances when you're driving
We do
Not used on signage, but otherwise longer distances are always given in _mil_.
The definition of a *favn* of firewood is 2m×2m×0
6m =2
4m^3
Traditionally it was a stack of wood one *favn* high, one *favn* wide with logs one *alen* (two Norwegian feet) long
Alternatively you can buy a *storfavn* (big fathom) witch is five normal favn, or 12m^3
Wood is also often sold in small sacks, 40 litres or 60 litres or in big sacks of 1000 litres
I strongly suspect that farmers still use favn when selling firewood just to confuse city dwellers
Not a sea person, but I think we do that too
"50 favner" depth rings a bell to me

Saving this thread and adding to my bucket list
Unlikely to find a better place to discover the lesser famous, but equally beautiful areas of Europe
Honourable mentions:

6 sept to 31 Oct
That's really really fast for an airport that size
we have forests lmao
Not to get in to a pissing contest, but fjords aren't created equal and ours are slightly more impressive
You have us beat on the other stuff though
Glaciers are smaller, our only (I think
) volcano is more remote, and no black beaches afaik
Weve got glaciers too and our fjords are far superior
i dont know about black beaches though
I think most of our beaches are normal
Got his ass
I think the builders also forgot the year
How very un-german of them
by the power of google and math i’ve determined you do have forests, but they’re barely there
by google i found that roughly two percent of iceland is forested, with an area of 103 000 square kilometers that is 2000 square kilometers
that’s 500 smaller than moscow and 500 bigger than london
compared to the norwegian woods which cover roughly 37% of norway, with an area 385200 square kilometers gives 142500 square kilometers of forest
that is 1
38 Icelands worth of forest
wow, that’s at least two icelands
you’re taking this too seriously man
Our "old towns" (although we generally don't have proper old towns as you have in continental Europe) and wooden vernacular architecture
I used to think it looked bland and boring, but I come to realise it is actually quite unique, charming and very cosy
It's unfortunately quite poorly preserved though due to a combination of fires and poor planning decisions
Our language
I used to dislike having two written forms of Norwegian instead of just one
Now, I appreciate the freedom to choose, and that people get to use the written language closest to their dialect
It’s a lot better than being forced to write some sort of hybrid language that’s not close to any dialect
> aspic
We have that in Norway too, although we call it Kabaret
It's a proper old people dish here
You are of course welcome, but sadly as mentioned they aren't as preserved as I would wish
I think Bergen and Stavanger are probably the best large cities to see such areas, while the coast of Sørlandet got a number of quite well preserved smaller wooden towns
I can definitively see some resemblances, but I think even the North-east of the USA have a more defined street grid than many of our wooden district have, which gives them a rather different atmosphere
I'm talking about areas such as [this]
Well I think that's a stretch in the other direction again
I at least think Norwegians towns are generally uglier than its counterparts in western, central and southern Europe
While I think the old wooden areas work nicely, well preserved examples of it are sadly few and far between
Many towns are instead just sad grey parking lots with a tired mall and a bunch of prefabricated villas
I actually think the state of many our towns looks is one of the worst aspects of the country
One thing pretty much every place in Norway got going for it though is a scenic natural setting
One example that is typical of Norway: Ørsta, a [mess of a place] but with [beautiful surroundings]
I assume you are referring to my remarks about "old towns"?
On the continent you often have very well defined old towns with clear a border separating them from the modern city
A very good example of this is [Krakow] Defined Old towns like that are very rare in Norway
Instead we usually have smaller and larger pockets of older buildings here and there that are intercepted by more modern buildings
[This area] from Bergen is a good example of what I mean: It's a wooden district following what's probably a street pattern laid down in the middle ages, yet it is completely detached from the similar old districts elsewhere in the city by more modern 19th and 20th century planning
There are only two places I can think of in Norway where you have a old town district with defined borders and a distinct identity, and that is [Gamlebyen] in Fredrikstad and [Gamle Stavanger] in Stavanger
In both cases though we are talking about district that are located a little to side of where their modern city ended up being, which is probably why they have ended up being better preserved than other places in Norway
You mentioned being on time in your example
Just curious, where are you from
I really like Røros and the older parts of Trondheim too, but these are sadly not representative of your average Norwegian town
We have far more places that looks like a [variation of this]
While that is said there have been a focus on how poorly planned many of our urban areas are here and many are planning/constructing projects that will hopefully help matters somewhat (at least from my point of view)
I have never been outside of Dublin in your country, but I could imagine that
I also think it applies to the UK for most part
Interesting
If you're on mobile you can go to the front page of r/AskEurope and there should be three dots in the upper right corner
And from there I think you can choose flair
No problem
We don't really have a lot of fast food chains here except McDonalds and Burger King, so a KFC or something would be pretty good
Id like KFC, the chicken in Norway is too expensive for it to be profitable here so sadly not gonna arrived here any time soon
Wok to Walk
I think they're Dutch but I've eaten at several locations around Europe (Amsterdam, London and Riga, I think), and they make a pretty good fast food wok
So I'm a bit sad that it's not something I can find in my own country
I agree
And we need Dunkin' Donuts, Tacobell and In n' Out
In fact, if we get Dunkin', I'll give up my hope of keeping myself relatively slim and embrace my inner fatso
I did actually read a bit on why they're not here and there's two reasons why:
They have their own distribution-network where they produce their own chickens, and Norway have very strict laws on chickens, so if KFC where to buy Norwegian chicken it would be too expensive
We have usable working environment laws in Norway and wage requirements, it will be extremely expensive for a chain that needs very cheap labor
That's very true and I think a big reason for it is that it's expensive to eat out and that almost no one does so
There are plenty of places in Oslo and Bergen, but that's because those cities have a lot of citizens
Places like Setesdal doesn't have a large enough customer base to support a place like that
I know I'll be disappointed, I just want the opportunity to go there lol
Not at all
Plenty of people use different mailing services
We say mail or e-post
Never heard that before, no
«E-post» or «mail» is the most common thing to say
I've never heard anyone refer to it as gmail
I also find that a lot of people I interact with either use hotmail, yahoo or other domains, personal or providers, rather than Google's service
Might be because of habit, or just not wanting to go over to a completely new system for no reason
Anyway, most people just refer to it as "e-post" or "mail".
Here I hear people use email or just mail
It's only when necessary that gmail or any other is specified
'e-post' is still the common word in both Norwegians
Yes, most people I know is not even using gmail
Most people I know use gmail
I'm gen z, though, so that might have something to do with it
Yeah, probably
My children use gmail at school, so I guess they might stick with that later also
I've seen some good suggestions here, but for Norway I'd probably go with this order:
Denmark (the so-called 400-Year Night, as well as them giving us our constitution and royal family)
Sweden (union, wars and close neighborhood)
Germany (the Hanseatic Period is a big part of our history, which permanently affected our economy, society and language
And then the occupation in WW2 of course)
Iceland (some might disagree, but the first generations on Iceland were Norwegian and  is thus an important part of Norwegian, as well as Icelandic, history)
UK (long-time trading partner and ally, especially in WW2, as well as close ties to the royal family)
1 & 2
Denmark and Sweden
Both have their history so intertwined with ours
From the vikings, through the Kalmar union and into the consecutive unions, both our Scandi brothers are impossible not to mention when discussing Norway’s history
United Kingdom
Our biggest trading partner for years, most important ally in WW2 and in many ways the cataclyst into how we broke off the union with Denmark in 1814
Russia
I would also say Germany due to WW2, as they occupied us while the Russians liberated/invaded much of the north depending on how you view it
In general Russia more so than Germany due to the USSR’s influence on Norwegian politics
United States
Basically impossible to not mention them when discussing the history of the past 100 years
The US constitution was also an inspiration to the Norwegian one, so there is that
Sweden and Denmark definitely
Then : Iceland and Germany
Then probably UK
Denmark 2
Sweden 3
Iceland 4
Germany 5
England maybe
(WW2 and pillaging)
For Norway:
Sweden
Denmark
~~Finland~~ USA (Switched out Finland for USA)
Either Germany or Russia
&#x200B;
Edit: Come to think of it, I'd probably put Finland below Germany/Russia
Denmark (Kalmar union)
Sweden (Union with sweden, great northern war)
England (Viking age, early medieval ages, 1066)
Germany (German occupation 1940-1945, hanseatic league)
Kinda stuck on the last one, Iceland maybe
* Denmark
* Sweden
* Iceland
* Germany
* USA
Russia could have been #5 too since they liberated Norway from the Nazis and there was a pro communism wave after WWII, but I chose the US because of their cultural importance
Not only music and movies, but Americana in every way is huge in (rural) Norway
Denmark
Sweden
Germany
England
Iceland
For Iceland I'd say Denmark, Norway, England, the US, then maybe Germany
I would like to see it, because that will make other countries that are not part of the EU (us) look at that and go; "maybe we should do the same", because I am sick of seeing friends falling on hard times due to gambling habits that have a origin from places like CS:GO skin gambling and other places
And seeing younger people on our LAN parties spending obscene amounts of cash on loot boxes in games, especially in games like FIFA
Here in Norway I have heard talk from friends and family working in the gambling commission that it is in the talks, but it is moving at a snail's pace and probably won't go nowhere unless there is massive backlash to the concept of loot boxes
But I haven't asked in quite a while, so maybe it has changed
If anybody know any updates on that, then I would like to read/see it
I think so
I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy playing games made by studios that EA killed off
This would at least be for a much better reason
Colder
If climate change make us loose the the Gulf stream
Norway has another referendum regarding joining the EU
I read the same lol
And in that same time frame Europe went from Empires to being divided by the Iron Curtain
Was looking for this, things don’t seem very prosperous to say it the least
In the following 51 years there has been an enormous development in the technological/digital side of things
You have to take into account that Germany win the most, arguably, in the economy aspect of the union, hence you, as a German, don't really have to think much about the economic aspect
People who are getting fucked over in the economic aspect are to be expected to talk about it
I also identify myself as European, even-tho Norway is my current location
Honestly i hope Europe will go the federal path like the US, but I don't really believe it can happen, since that would require wealth redistribution
That's what I find quite strange, "no good reason to go"; I mean yea, sure I get it, insane costs, little to no clear benefit, sure, but at the same time we have 24 carat gold Rolls Royce cars being built, golden toilets, diamond butt-plugs, people building islands in the middle of the sea next to a shitty desert, and other things one would say "there is no good reason to build/buy that" - yet we have them
And yet we don't have "colony" on the moon
It's quite strange, as having moon colony would be the best propaganda tool ever for every country with "supremacist syndrome" (we have plenty of those) . But let's leave that aside
How about research - maybe we can research birth of life outside of earth - mice, monkeys, dogs, even humans
First human born outside of the Earth - how does that sound
We have theories about how those will go, but we don't really know much
Furthermore, currently when thinking of human settlements you think of the globe map and all the countries in there, just imagine having the fucking moon on the map with some settlements there as well -useless, yet complete game changer on how the human species sees itself in the universe
Currently we are species living on a rock in space; The leap to living on two rocks is much more grand than most things i can imagine, honestly
I am not some insane conspiracy theorist, but it is strange for me that we dont even have some permanent establishment on the moon like the ISS, but international moon station or something;
I work in predictive analytics and there are some super exciting things that are happening in the field and our capabilities are so much more than what they were even 10 years ago, and I am even more excited for what's to come
Space exploration is inherently much more exciting - yet lately I haven't been wow-ed
I was curious to what those languages are and google the last one - Aurignais
It ended up being the language of island of Alderney with present day population of 2000 people
Language died off with the last native speaker in 1940s.
Languages are born and die for reasons, and since the 2000 people speaking aurignais don't really see a point of speaking it - well maybe its time and purpose has come to an end
Or is it that you want my tax dollars to sponsor /**take steps to protect**/ a population equal to that of us redneck  trailer-park to speak their local dialect
That last one might come off a bit cynical, but for real - who cares about dying language spoken by a hundred people
«Raske briller», someone wearing sport glasses in a specific style often with multiple colors on the glass is a meme in Norway
Ngl the Danes have the best memes between all the Nordics
Don’t forget that we have replaced the drake meme
[Egon Olsen] random example from Google
For Norway it is Sweden
We have a lot of shared history, shared culture and we share a huge border together
Sweden is often referred to as "Søta bror" here, which translates to sweet brother (sounds quite weird in English)
It's also the country which always compare ourselves with
We see Denmark is very closely related too but they have a slightly more distant location
Brothers, Denmark and Sweden
Finland is like the quiet cousin thats always chill
Well, scandinavia is weird in that way
Norway, Sweden and Denmark is that one weird group of siblings where Norway and Denmark always make fun of Sweden
This probably depends on location
Someone more south or west in Norway would say Denmark, but someone more north and east would say Sweden
This is just a thought I had though, so not fact
A lot of us do
Some would claim it's Sweden though
Don't get me wrong Norwegians like Denmark, but we do love Sweden more
Eventhough they are our "svikefulle bror"
I haven't met many Lithuanians, but I found the Latvians much more cheerful than Estonians
Estonians are like like the Finns, quiet and gloomy (which being Norwegian I obviously dont mind)
Do Latvians feel the same way
How do you view Lithuanians in this regard
I might be in the minority but I feel Finland is our third, sort of weird brother/sister, besides Sweden and Denmark, but that's because I love Finland so much c:
(And we do share a border after all
Not Russia though, Russia is the scary neighbour with a scary garden shed)
How do Latvians view Estonians
Edit: sorry if that question offended anyone
It was meant as an honest question
Arent your language close'ish to Finish and Estonian
Do you feel related to them in any way at all
Now I feel guilty that I forget that you exist sometimes
Wish we could move you over here into the Nordic brotherhood
We are rather boring over here, but at least its peaceful
And although we bicker a lot, but we do care about each-other
Switzerland, the Iceland of the mainland
Oh I had no idea you felt lonely
Join the Nordic
Yes
For a Norwegian point of view you are very similar
Estonia is still a bit under the influence of recent history, but they never lost their Estonian way of being (which is very similar to Finish)
I personally felt very surprised as to how Nordic they are every time I've visited
And extremely different from Russians who have lived in Estonia for decades
So the Russians were never able to remove the Nordic personality in their culture
No, Denmark just kidnapped you from your real daddy Norway
Come back, my child
Am I the only Norwegian who feels closer to Sweden than Denamark
Dont forget our neighbor Finland, that Cousin that hangs around always a little sketchy and drunk but a nice fella anyways
True, I grew up close to the Swedish border and would still say Sweden, I’m not too much of a fan of all their political descisions and policies but I still feel they’re the ones I can relate the most with
Denmark is and feels farther away, but obviously we’re close with them too
Well, they're called "söta bror", I don't recall having a similar name for Denmark
I would say its both
Really depends on where you live
I would say the west and south coast is really well connected with denmark
Now I feel bad for Denmark
top ten saddest anime betrayals
> And then there's Sweden's cousins Norway and Denmark who never considered Finland a part of the family
We do
but we only tend to include Finland when we include Iceland into the family as well I guess
And since we include Finland we can just as well include Estonia
First time I hear about this
If you have managed to make a Finish friend you have made a friend for life
What are your view on Norwegians
Danes
> I feel that Norway and Sweden has way more in common by geography and climate than we have with Denmark
With winter sports, mountains, Right to roam-laws, and state monopoly stores for alcohol, Snus consumption and such
Denmark feels much more continental, like Germany and the Netherlands
I agree
I will also say that both Sweden and Norway have, at least in my impression, a much larger urban and rural divide than what Denmark have
On a serious note, what are the sentiments towards independence
And then the distant relative Russia that no one really notices but is always there creeping in the corner
We also call them "svenskefaen".
So the further south the more fun-loving
Interesting
Living in Norway I hardly know what that even means
But a country can be part of two (or more) groupings though
Norway belong to Scandinavia where Finland and Iceland will never be able to join
And we are part of the Nordic
In the same way Estonia will always be connected to both the Baltics and Finland
Oh ok I see
I thought they were more similar so you could at least understand some words
I guess the geography led the two langages to move so far apart from each other
The meme is obv sweden bad,  it also very much depends on where in the country you live as anything along the west coast really doesnt have a relationship with sweden
Sweden bad
Idk about Denmark
Depends who you would ask
Most Norwegians would probably say good or ok i think
> From a danish wiew, Sweden bad, Norway fine
> From a Swedish wiew, Denmark bad, Norway nice
> I don’t really know how it is from a norweigian wiew
The Norwegian view is that as long as we're not living together, you're all fine
Including the other Nordic countries, which I'd say we also feel quite strong kinship with
> Scandinavia are also my cousins, they're 4 siblings,
There are three countries in Scandinavia: Norway, Sweden and Denmark
Iceland and Finland are only Nordic
Together, they are the 5 Nordic countries
Well, we wont send any Vikings in long boats
I promise
Thats the only one i have seen
Norwegians binge drink
So your theory must be true
In Norway the sauna culture is still the same
Everyone is welcome in the sauna as long as they are naked
I think so
It's not that we want to remove Estonia from the Baltics, its just that we feel related to them as well, in the same way (although a bit less I guess) as Latvia and Lithuania
Yeah none of us can afford to drink wine on a Tuesday
Skandinaviske brødre, hvor er dere

Not sure if this is a regional thing or if it's done everywhere, but right after dinner guests will start making a lot of noise (foot stomping, clinking glass ect
) and won't stop until the newlyweds stand up on their chairs and kiss
Norway: This is a local tradition from the area I grew up in
Friends not invited to the wedding will prepare some entertainment, dress up in something funny, and pitch unannounced a bit late at the weeding party
There they will perform their prepared piece, and then they get cake
Haven't heard of this in any other part of Norway though
If the bride wears a traditional dress on her wedding day, she can rent a literal crown if she wants to
There are four types of "crowns", Brudelad (  Hat with onsown silver),Bruderull ( A roll that goes around the head and has silver ornaments ) Brudekrone and Small Brudekrone
Brudekrone (Bride's crown) were very popular in Europe during the 15th century (I think
) So I'm pretty sure some other countries also do this
I've heard of this
Southern Norway plus Oslo
On the mouth or on the cheek
We only kiss the bride on the cheek as far as I know
The [royal standard] since I think it looks pretty cool as fuck, and it is the standard most kings during the middle ages used as their standard on ships and fortresses
I’m also monarchist, so it’s good for me
Not excactly what you asked for but I think our cost of arms should look more like it looked before, now it looks like it drawn by a child before it actually looked like it was drawn by someone with experience
And also I like when coat of arms are on flags, so maybe I would add our coat of arms on the flag
Not really, I like thats it's simple and the colours are bice too
If I had to do something then maybe a slightly  darker shade of red
I'd kind of like to ditch the cross to be honest, but unsure what to have instead
Make it less christian
Make it a sun cross or something
2 extra legs then
I have allways wondered about why Swedes like that light blue and yellow
Not that our flag is so much better (but it is, obviously), but that blue looks weak
The old flag with the darker blue color looks a lot like the Norwegian blue
And better
Now that I think of it, there are 4 countries with blue in their flag in the Nordics and Sweden has the weakest blue, don't you
(Finland laughs, Iceland nods and Norway shouts Yes
That's the Brexturn flag
Your previous flag was awesome though
no, needs some blue too
[this shows the evolotion of the coat of arms
White is hardly a color
But not all countries can afford both red AND blue ;)
The Sovjet one
I love communist flags and the visuals in "motivational" posters etc
Helt otroligt hur mycket bättre det ser ut
Har de någonsin officiellt övervägt att byta tillbaka det
Red in the corners with white surrounding them
And now I'm craving chocolate, and I'm quarantined due to the current pandemic
Thanks a lot
Same in Norway
Amen brothers
Most people move out at 18-21 anyway so it's often not going to be an issue but I have heard of it happening yes
Usually it's people who are done studying and move home for a short while to just save up whilst the first year or two of them working
So if you work full time but live at your parents house it's probably common to atleast help out at home in some way
And that could include paying a little rent but I wouldn't say it's the norm
I moved home now under corona and I'm not paying anything but I help out with stuff that's needed
Like mowing the lawn or whatever
That's generally enough
When I was a student, I lived at home for two of the four years and I had a part time job
My mom had left my dad a few years earlier and she couldn't get a loan to buy anything so she was renting the apartment we lived in
I paid a small amount of money to her each month to help with her expenses
It was way less than if I were to rent somewhere myself, and since I had a part-time job + student loans it was only fair that I would help my mom
I've also hear of some parents charging rent from their young adult kids that are students, that are known to not have the best personal economy for the parent to then put those funds in a savings account for their kid
Pretty smart if you ask me
I’m currently living with my parents at 22 y.o to save money for an apartment
As long as I continue to work and study they are happy with it
I have never heard of anyone paying rent, but I think a lot of parents expect their kids to study, work, or improve their high school grades if they continue to stay at home after high school
If they're still kids, no
If they're in their mid 20s and have a full time job, then I wouldn't find it weird if they payed some form of rent if they still lived with their parents
Unless they're saving up to buy their own house, which many will do, and many parents will help their kids out by giving money or providing the bank as "surety" (dunno if that is the right word) so that their kids can get a loan
In Norway, if you own a house with an apartment floor, it is normal to charge your kids(over 18) rent if they are living in that apartment
In my case, I was living with my parents for free and have my own bedroom until I was 18
When I turned 18, I moved down to the basement apartment and they would charge me rent
Not as much as they would charge a stranger, but enough that I could experience what it's like paying for rent
I would occasionally still go upstairs and have dinner with them, but mostly I bought my own dinners from then and on
This taught me a lot about being independent
Second this
- Norway
Julius the chimpanzee is a strong contender, he’s not as famous now but back in the day, he was raised by humans (out of necessity) and has his own books, a theme song, plushies, tv show (iirc) and he now lives in the zoo in Kristiansand
We also have the whale Hvaldimir (a play on the Norwegian word for whale = hval, and the Russian name Vladimir)
He’s a white whale that one day in May 2019 suddenly appeared in northern Norway
He was wearing a harness with a GoPro camera thing on (the thing the camera goes on, not the camera itself), and the harness was marked with “St
Petersburg”. So naturally, we concluded he was a Russian spy whale
Russia says he’s not
Anyways, the whale is well trained and have been known to retrieve things people drop in the water, play with kayakers etc
He’s taken care of by the city he now lives in; he doesn’t seek out other whale company and the state makes sure he’s protected (as much as possible) and well fed
There was also Keiko, the whale from Free Willy who chose to spend his retirement in Norway
He's been dead for a while now though
We also have [Sir Nils Olav] though he lives in Edinburgh
Good one
Forgot about him
Yeah, but he wasn’t that much of a national pet
More like a fun curiosity
Fuck that Dane though lol
I've heard a lot of people describe Norwegian as melodic and "singing". Too bad my dialect is kind of the opposite
A Portoguese guide told us that we sounded like fish on land
I was talking Norwegian and my husband spoke Swedish back to me
Like it’s spoken backwards
Most languages have an accent that starts on a high tone and ends in a low
Most Norwegian dialects are opposite, so we start low and end high
Ive heard from many americans saying people who speak norwegian kinda sounds like they’re singing for some reason
cant hear it myself but then again, i am norwegian
Danish is like a person speaking Norwegian with a potato stuck in their throat
Which dialect is it
Northern
Yeah you're right, that's actually the term people use but I didn't remember it
I can think of a more German description
You know those square Ritter Sport chocolates
Their slogan is "Quadratisch
Praktisch
Gut
" ("Square, practical, good)
Only the Germans kan advertise a chocolate by how praktisch it is
Good chocolate, though
Most dialects outside the (south-)east aren't very sing-songy
It's just that easterners are very prominent in the media
Kristianstad is in Sweden
Kristiansand is in the south of Norway
The Kristiansand dialect can sound a bit like Danish
What you are referring to in your last paragraph is a real thing and is a major way to divide languages into two groups:
Spanish is a “syllable-timed language”, where every syllable is pronounced at approximately the same speed, while English is a “stress-timed language”,  which means that different syllables are pronounced at different speeds
That's OK, you're not the first
There's a rumor of some Italian soldiers going to Norway for a joint force exercise, who was told to meet up at the ferry terminal in Kristiansand
They couldn't find the terminal, and after some military grade Sherlocking, they realized that they were in Sweden
They missed the target by one country, 9 hours by car
Denmark, thank you for being a great peaceful neighbour in general
Even if your language is weird ;)
Also thank you Sweden, for the exact same reasons, even if you are a bit dense sometimes ;)
Thanks to the both of you for cheap alchohol, tobacco, candy, and foodstuff
Thanks Italy for giving me an addiction to your food;)
Russia/USSR
They liberated my Norway, but unlike the "liberation" of eastern europe, they actually went home once the dust had settled
UK - Thank you for all the amazing TV-shows, James May and Harry Potter
Ireland - Thank you for Father Ted and Chris O’Dowd
Finland - Thank you for the moomins and all the awesome metal bands, especially Nightwish
Iceland - Thank you for the Icelandic horses and Stefan Karl Stefansson
Sweden - Thank you for snus, IKEA, Astrid Lindgren and cheap food and alcohol
Denmark - Thank you for being you, I love everything about you
Thanks Russia for liberating the northernmost part of Norway during WW2
Not many people know this but some of the worst battles in the whole war took place in this hellish, freezing wilderness in Finnmark
14000 soldiers on both sides died
Must have been horrible for sure, and the human sacrifices they made had a big impact on the war
After the war, they ceded the territory back to Norway
It's not really well acknowledged and honored by the mainstream Norwegian society because they were Soviet, which in my opinion is sad
But the local population up north have a historical friendship with the Russian neighbors
Thank you Denmark and Sweden for making us feel wanted <3
Spain and Italy
Their food makes life worth living
Thanks for taking care of the culture and mythology
In my apartment I always lock the door
Not that it's necessary
In the 7 years I've lived here, I've only had one incident of someone trying to open the door, and as it was at night during the weekend and he tried using a key, it was definitely some drunk person on the wrong floor who thought it was his apartment
My parents live in a house in a smaller town, and they only lock the doors during the night
They've never had an attempted break-in in their 40+ years living there though
Nobody in my area even locks the door when they’re not at at home
We only lock them if we’re going away for a long time
I live in a rural area
Yes
I didn't when I lived in my family home, but then when I moved out into an apartment for the first time I started doing it
Mostly because I didn't know the neighbours
Now it's just a habit
Yes, but only because I have a toddler that might escape
Otherwise not
It's common for people in the city to lock the door, but not common on the countryside
My mum lives in a village where she knows everyone, and people that knows each other well wont even knock before entering
You just walk in and knock on the living room door and walk straight in to the living room
(You never wait for someone to say "Come in
") Everybody locks their door just before going to bed though
Yes, but only because i live in a low-income neighborhood
A lot of druggies and beggars around here that could easily dip their hands past the door to nick something while i'm sat in my room playing videogames not noticing anything
Trying to use a key, while making a lot of noise is definitely a drunk person
Next time, try opening the door - it will give them the fright of their life
Not in Norway, never heard about it until now
> Don't your front doors lock when they're being shut
Never heard of anyone having a door like that on the countryside
Only a thing in the city
> I live in a small village and we always have the keys hanging outside during the day,
My mum lives in a small village
Sometimes when I visit I just put a garden chair in front of the door when I pop out for a bit and my mum is also out
Not to deter people from breaking in, but to tell the neighbours that no one is at home, if they were to come by
Well, the front doors to apartment buildings etc
work like that, so it's not a crazy concept
But the doors to single apartments and houses aren't like that generally
You've never heard of smekklås? They're very common here in Bergen
This is why I have never understood the reasoning for this type of door
Sure, you end up double check if you locked the door once in a while
But every time you're just going outside the house to remember the keys
How do you do it with families, are all the kids and parents bringing their own key outside if they're just chilling in the yard
What if you don't, and everyone assumes the others have brought their key
Lol, just thinking about it makes me anxious
Djånn meid hiss oei tu a tævvern fru de dark fårrest, åonli tu faind dæt hi fårgått de månni
Don't really have a way to properly spell the various "th" sounds, so "d" and "f" will have to suffice
Also the "j" sound in "John" is pretty hard to spell out
Sjånn meid his vei tu æ tævern tru de dark fårest ånli tu faind aut dat hi fårgått de månni
Takeaways from this:
Most european languages are phonetical, whereas english is not, meaning that a letter most often only represents one sound regardless of where you find it
The most common is U rather than O in «to», followed by something like id, jd or yd rather than the de in «made». Also Hi instead of He and several rather than one sound representing the O in Out/Only, the a in «A» and the I in Find (most commonly Faind/fajnd)
Also worth noting is that J in most languages has the function of Y, whereas Y is a vowel similar to i, or somewhere between u and i. Therefore John needs to written as Djohn in most languages as John on it’s own would most likely read as yohn
I love this little game
This isn't the first time I've tried fitting English phonetics into Norwegian orthography
Anyways, here is my attempt: *"Jånn meid his oei tu æ tævern fru vø dark fårest, ånli tu faind æot væt hi fårgått vø månni
Jånn meid his vei tu a tævørn tru de dark fårest, åonli tu faind aot dætt hi fårgått de månni
Djånn meid his uei tu a tævern fru de dark fårest, ånli tu faind æot dat hi fårgått de månni
Norwegian:
Djånn meid hiss uei tu ey tavøn fru dhe dak fårrest, ånli tu faind aot dæt hi fårgått dhe måni
*Dsjånn mejd hiss vei tu æ tævvern tru de dark forrest, åonli tu faind aot dætt hi fårgott de monni
Quite similar in Norwegian
If I read the original sentence with an American accent, it would go as follows:
"Djan meyd hiss uei tu æ tæværrn fru det dark fårrest, åunli tu faind aut dat he fårgåt det månni".
Åonli, maybe
My version is as follows:
"Djan meyd hiss uei tu æ tæværrn fru det dark fårrest, åunli tu faind aut dat he fårgåt det månni".
"Djan" because I read the name with a (mental) American accent, same with "meyd". "Uei" or your "oei" are both fine IMO
I used "æ" instead of "a", maybe the accent thing again
"Det" instead of "de" because of precisely the "det/de" reading thing
Nice
Yeah, that's better
*Fuck-Thursday*.
It was recently uncovered that the Norwegian Police Academy has for years had a sketchy party culture with something they unofficially named Knulletorsdag, or Fuck-Thursday, among their students and instructors
People have been paying with sex for favours and better grades
So now everyone's going around making jokes and using the term in relation to Thursday
And as you can guess the police's social media accounts have really been getting hit lately, with people making memes, photoshops and videos about Fuck-Thursday
[Like this TikTok (gif link)
Yes, our police force has a damn TikTok account
Someone edited the video of a young female police officer pointing to text boxes which in reality explained why the police was on TikTok, to her instead pointing to boxes saying:
>Why is the Police on TikTok
> To
> Dismiss
> Your case
> We don't have time
> It's Fuck-Thursday️
Oh, and then there's the pandemic restrictions I guess
But we don't have time to think about that, cause Fuck-Thursday's approaching
> and whether or not the government will face a vote of no confidence
Why
Don't forget the US election
I feel like every time I turn on the TV or read the news there is something about Trump
Three more days now
It's the greatest gift to Norwegian meme culture since Helge Ingstad
This was on the news in Norway, and I’m so sorry for you
This is just horrible :(
Hopefully
I would love it if Biden became the president, just to have "normal" level of news from US
You would think
However, last election year here in Norway, Norwegian press had three times more articles about Trump than about Erna Solberg, our PM
And it wasn't even an election in the US that year
Yeah, I feel the same way
For science, NTNU, Trondheim
For economics, Handelshøyskolen, Bergen
Dunno about the other fields, Oslo probably excels at a lot of other things
For natural sciences: NTNU (Trondheim)
For everything else: UiO (Oslo) and maybe UiB (Bergen)
The University of Oslo maybe
I don't know
But all our universities are good quality, so I wouldn't have a problem sending my child to any of them
Oslo is top dog for medicine and law
But all the big universities (University of Oslo, University of Bergen, Norwegian University of Science and Technology) are generally well regarded
Friend of mine from Norway just got in
Would one say its like the Harvard of Europe
None
I find all of them interesting, and hope to visit all the ones I haven't visited yet
All European countries have interesting history, nice nature, and friendly people
Not to mention being able to try out the local food
Uninteresting, imo it's Sweden (mainly the northern part), mainly because it's similar to Norway, but the whole geography of Sweden is pretty booring, flat, flat, flat and lot's of forests
Its quite funny how it all changes when you go from Norway to Sweden up north, large mountains and deep valleys etc, then into Sweden and it's just like a large slope going down to the most booring area of water in existence
Good roads though
Romania
I know, I know, its the home of Dracula, but I honestly found it the most boring place in Europe I've visited
I dont know what it is about the place, but I just couldn't get into it
> I don't know but I always forget that Moldova exists
Moldova happens to be on the top of the list of European countries I would love to visit next
Been to Slovakia once
Loved Bratislava and Komarom/Komarno
Also the country-side
Would also like to hike in the Tatra mountains some day
I actually find that Denmark has a lot of cool history
Im Norwegian, but vacationed in Denmark more times than I can count, and have seen a lot of it
They have creepy sand-drowning lighthouses, they had a church that was falling into the ocean, that gave me nightmares for years, several really cool aquarium museums, really old viking settlement places where they re-enact life during the viking age that are historically accurate
There are some really cool museums showing the history of both Denmark, Scandinavia, H. C. Andersen's birth place is really cool, and nearby there is a museum with some really exciting exhibitions
København has a lot to offer for everyone
Outside of Ribe, is an island you can only drive through when there's low-tide
And the food
So much amazing food
Denmark has a lot to offer, especially if you roadtrip across the country
Whenever we've went, we've chosen a nice place to stay as our "base" and then we've driven around to check out new places we havent seen yet
There's not a lot of places left we havent seen
Every little city and town seems to have at least some old history to explore
I guess the interesting thing about Northern Sweden is the emptyness and amount of wilderness
You could probably hike for weeks there and see no one
But yeah I drive up north once a year usually and while driving through Sweden takes roughly the same time I usually opt for Norway because of more life, towns and interesting nature when driving up north
I can agree
I usually plan my vacations based on three categories:
Big cities
Beach/sun
Nature experiences
If youre not really looking for a nature experience, you can find more interesting travel destinations for cheaper elsewhere
Copenhagen is great, though
I feel like you go somewhere to experience something different, and except for nature, Norway's tourist industry doesnt have much to offer
It is a great place to live, but not a great place to travel if you are looking for anything else than scenery
But I dont really understand the Iceland part, from my understanding Iceland is the about the same price as Norway
And I would'nt really go to Iceland either for any other reason than scenery
I will say that myself
We have a lot of nature and it can be really nice but if you aren’t into that you will miss out on a lot and should honestly go somewhere else
..someone's feeling left out
No good food in Luxemburg
>I don't think Scandinavian countries are cool at all
Then you should try going there without a jacket
Yes absolutely
The most common travel destinations for norwegians, besides our neighbouring countries are hot southern european beach destinations
We travel in numbers to Spain, Greece, Italy, Croatia and France etc during the summer holiday
It's been a bad year if you haven't been to a warm place with a beach at least once
For most people
There are always exceptions
Not sure if rude is the right word, but asking someone if they are okay/all right  for no reason is weird*, and when it happens several times it, at least to me, is very uncomfortable (and maybe feels rude)
Thankfully because of the internet I have learned that apparently this is common and polite in some places, and that is why some people who come here might do this, I just wish I knew it earlier
*I have to add that I mean when there is nothing to suggest something might be wrong
When everything is fine and there is no reason to think the person is not ok, and yet they ask if you’re alright/ok
Where I live we only say “can you pass the salt
” or “can I get the salt
”. And then “thank you” when the other person passes it or when they are about to pass it
That’s why in English class we were taught that if we ever went to the US or UK we had to remember to say please or we would be considered rude
Apparently it was a very common mistake
Yes we might do that too if the person is sick, that’s why I wrote “for no reason”, maybe I should have specified
I’m talking about when there’s no reason to think something is wrong
From what I understand, and I might be wrong about this, it’s sort of like how people from certain countries (Like US I think
) ask “what’s up” or “how’s it going” without actually caring about the answer
Even if someone looks a little sick though, we don’t keep asking if they are ok if they have already answered once, but this also depends on how close the people are to each other
For example if a friend doesn’t look good, I might keep pushing
But for another student I hardly know, I would either not ask at all, or I would only ask once
In norwegian we would say
>Kan du sende saltet er du snill
Could you pass the salt are you kind
I don’t feel like that’s so common
I would say that the most common is just “can you pass the salt
” Alternatively “can I have the salt
”  or just reaching over and grabbing it yourself
We have corruption, but less than most
I don't know if we have corruption in the same sense that you'll find in eastern europe and elsewhere, but you definitively get the impression that political careers are just a stepping stone to lucrative jobs abroad in NGOs and the like
As far as I know, we aren\`t that corrupt, but we most definetly have many corrupt politicians
I\`m not that engaged in that area of Norwegian politics, so there might be more corruption than what I know of
We have some form of corruption in the northern regions, but for the most part, no
very little if any
there might be some *very* slight corruption in certain areas but nothing to actually care about
Un-corrupt enough that when a scandal does come up, it's usually something like "this politician got an exemption for a car salesperson to build a cabin 50 meters too close to the shoreline, in return for a really good deal on a BMW
".... but corrupt enough that this happens
That is really creepy
> but also very corrupt places
What do you mean
So sad :( That is an good example that too mutch power for the leaders is bad
> För example in Malmö, Sweden some parts have been heavily affected by gang crime and the police don't have the capacity to stop it anymore
How does that make Sweden more corrupt
I think he means socially corrupt ( as in the inability of the government to change the crime rate) instead of economically corrupt
Well there's also the Faroe Islands at 49k and Greenland at 56k if we count those
This sounds really awesome
Love it
The only downside with live classical music is those audience sounds on the background:
[Beautiful piano musi
"BPPRGHUCHGFHUPPRGHCOUGH"
[...continued beautiful piano m... SOMEONE DROPS A PEN]

"BRPRUGH
You mean a tunnel to Scotland right
Since the only thing that isn’t ludicrously unrealistic I mean
Wait why does Malmö need a metro connection from Copenhagen when you have a train connection already
Yeah I the lack of freedom in Sweden (?)
Yeah no thanks I’d rather we not destroy the world’s climate (more than already I mean)
No Oslo stop
Anyways if we can just get a decent speed link from Oslo to Copenhagen without switching trains in Gothenburg I would be thrilled
If I could just get a decent high speed train link to Copenhagen from Oslo without having to change in Gothenburg I would be thrilled
uhm
we arent exactly in the eu
Cool
Surprising that a metro line would be that much quicker than the train but I guess it’s much more of a direct route with less stops so it makes sense I guess
Please, all I want is just what’s good for the world’s climate
*pumps more oil while no one is watching*
Well the guy I was responding to said he wanted a train from Bergen so don’t look at me
We do, but the government would rather spend them on ludicrously expensive highways thatto serve a couple of remote villages on the west coast
In Norway some say that the city of Bergen is not really a part of Norway
They have a distinct dialect, local traditions and are very proud to be from Bergen
Said by a person from Oslo it would be an attempt at a put down, but when people from Bergen hear it, they usually proudly agree :)
Not exactly, but there's a joke that Bergen is not in Norway
Such as "I'm not from Norway, I'm from Bergen". They have a different dialect and take enourmous pride in being from Bergen
We second that
Håkon, Harald, Olav, Sonja, Ingrid-Aleksandra, Emma Talula, Mette Marit, Mertha Louise, Merta, Margrete
I think thats about it
We have been occupied by sweeden and Denmark so our royal family only contains about 4 generation with the last one obviusly being the biggest one
I also included Sonja who is our queen, was not royal to start with, but married at the time out crown prince, now King Harald and Mette Marit (not royal to begin with) who is married to crown prince Håkon
I am not including the sweedish and danish royal familys because they were not ours, they belonged to our occupants
90% of our monarchs were named either Harald or Olav
Hopefully you'd have a kid after Ingrid Alexandra became queen, lol
What color the Christmas soda should have, red or brown
The brown ones are more traditional and taste better, but the red ones are more christmaslike
Furthermore, each color has several brands, all of which have regional ties to one or more cities
You should try to resolve this before the people of Northern Ireland get entrenched in two camps that resent each other for no good reason
We call it skalk
You should too, it even translates easily into German; Schalck
The Nutella
Fixed it for you
>The brown ones are more traditional and taste better
I will not tolerate this type of slander of the superior Christmas soda, smh
>The brown ones are more traditional and taste better
You, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar
We call it "sisten" (the last), or correctly "tikken" (i can't really translate it)
It's masculine in Norwegian, probably mostly because the definite suffix for feminine nouns is -a and "Nutellaa" doesn't work so well
The Norwegian word for rolls is rundstykke
So I suppose they say Rundstück somewhere in the Northern part
> Ründstück(lol)
That's what we call them and it's probably your fault
The soft k languages stand together against the evil Danish
Some even make champagne colored julebrus which tastes like Villa Farris or champagin soda
No thanx, it's all about the Sørlands for me
> Protestants keep it in a cupboard
Catholics on the counter
Must be a Irish thing
Every protestant I know keep it on the counter
Checks out, because cats are also psychopaths
It has to be added, when making it definite
The suffix is only used in the definite case, indefinite uses an article but no suffix
So for masculine it's "en Nutella", "Nutellaen", but for feminine it would be "ei Nutella", "Nutellaa", which doesn't really work
I actually don't think any feminine nouns end with -a in the definite, but I've never thought of that before now
Huh
Is this regional, or universally understood
There are 4,27% protestants in Ireland
Do they keep it on the counter as well
(The only way that makes sense if you ask me
Highly educational - and made me hungry
Thanks
> We keep it on the counter
The only sensible thing to do
You end up knowing so many celebrities, or knowing someone that is related to them
I just wonder, what do you guys think about your military
And what are the opportunities in it
i took a pic of my brother and the prime minister lol, she was doing something political idk in the street and anyone could talk to her
Platypus is beak animal (Nebbdyr)
Orca is fat chopper (Spekkhogger)
A lot of the german ones from the top comment apply to norwegian as well
I really like "sommerfugl" (butterfly)
It translated to "summer bird" :)
Racoon = Vaskebjørn (washing bear)
Hippo = Flodhest (flood horse)
Rhino = Neshorn (nose horn)
Hedgehog = Piggsvin (spike swine)
Sloth = Dovendyr (lazy animal)
Bat = Flaggermus (flutter mouse)
Squid is ink squirt (blekksprut)
Porcupine is spike pig (pinnsvin)
Hippopotamus is river horse (flodhest)
Viper is chop worm (hoggorm)
Turtle is shield toad (skilpadde)
Weasel is mound cat (røyskatt)
Butterfly is summer bird (sommerfugl)
Dragonfly is eye stinger (øyenstikker)
Manatee is sea cow (sjøku)
We say vaskebjørn, washing bear - absolutely nonsensical
Also, tadpole is bum troll (rumpetroll)
I mean, Despacito was also insanely overplayed here
But in terms of the music coming from Norway, I guess the closest would be [The Fox] by Ylvis or maybe [Raske briller] by Nicolay Ramm for a Norwegian speaking option
I would give that crown to [salsa Tequila ] as the text is technically in Spanish
Mmm, sommerkroppen is also up there with The Fox
While alot og other songs got traction om home parties etc, Sommerkroppen was played at a lot of festivals 2 years ago
And Fairytale by Alexander rybak
It was overused for a couple of years for shure
Even he got tierd by the song
As I wak wak wak wak wak wak wak a mikafon
No love for Boten Anna
That also fits, turns out we have quite a lot of semi viral, meme-able music
The Fox was clearly most viral as that actually became internationally viral
I keep coming back to the fact that we have a lot of this music
Like, TIX's entire library, Pinne for Landet, Fredag, freaking Haugenstua, even Fy faen was massive when it came out
We have a lot of this kind of music
EDIT: Obviously Haugenstua was released during COVID, but I'm fairly sure it would have been played at festivals this summer if it hadn't been for COVID
Also huge
If we're talking BIGGEST most known song from Norway (other than the Fox) that would have to be A-ha's Take On Me and just A-ha in general
I think most Norwegians have a love-hate relationship with Fairytale, lol
You're welcome
Who have you been blaming the Fox on
LOL
Pretty sure Faded is bigger than take on me
So true
Its probably the same with What dos the fox say as well :')
That just made me feel SO damn old
Anyway, I submit [Boten Anna] for Sweden
That just depends on what you deem as "virality", because in terms of internet meme-ness the Fox takes them all
The views on YouTube says it all
I think we forget how huge they were worldwide
Never heard of Faded
Fill me in, please
Edit: Ah, the Alan Walker song
Yes, that one was pretty big
But you definitely under estimate the hugeness of Take on me
It's been a flipping anthem for almost 30 years
With all sorts of bands covering it long after it went off the hit charts
In 20 years, probably nobody is going to do a cover of Alan Walker, I'm sorry to say
However big that song was for a period of time, it never reached the level of global hit-ness that Take
On Me has
That’s definitely true
I work with kids that love the Fox, so I’m more in the hate camp personally, lol
Ylvis have some great catchy, strange songs
The Fox is pretty damn annoying to be fair
Faded from alan walker
Looking at both spotify and youtube it has over a billion more streams in total
Although it is hard to say which of them has been heard the most thought
“Fade”, which is a NCS song from Alan walker and the one faded is based on got really popular
A saw a lot of people use it because no copyright
And the music industry has had a drastic shift since take on me came out in 1985 and now a lot of stuff is streamed
Same, it was fun in the beginning, but now i mostly dislike the song and love the music video :')
I still think Take on me is a bigger hit
I'm 40 now, and I bought the cassette as my first ever record when I was like 5 or 6
And I guess my then 30 year old parents must've known it, and probably half the older generation
And it hit globally, massively, when bands became true rock stars
Nowadays things hit the market very differently
Music consumers today don't go out and spend 150 kr on a CD, they stream a song or a playlist more or less unconsciously (compared to buying a CD)
Alan Walker is not, nor will he ever be, as hugely known as a-ha due to the way people consume music then VS now
And definitely not as big as Take On Me which is instantly recognized by most people under 70, down to teenagers/kids today
Norway has been working on national ID cards since 2007, they were supposed to be ready in 2013, but they have been delayed over and over and over and are still not here
The way we used to do ID here is we had photo ID at the back of our debit cards, but a few years ago many banks stopped doing this as it's expensive to produce and they expected the government to roll out national ID very soon
Thanks to this many people are now in a situation where they have no valid ID card except their giant passport that they have to lug around everywhere if they do not have a driving license, some also don't have passports and so do not have ID at all
They are reportedly rolling them out this fall, but I am not holding my breath
>**In 2007, it was estimated that providing new national ID cards to residents of Norway would cost 14 million kroner ($1
7 million, €1
5 million)
Today, the price tag has ballooned to over 700 million kroner ($86 million, €73 million)
This stupid ass [ship tunnell] A tunnell for boats, like a canal but under a mountain
To cross from one fjord to the next and avoid the open sea
Never been done before anywhere in the world
Probably for good reason
Estimated cost around 300 million euro
Let’s hope it never happens, the cost of corona should kill the project
There are others, too
Usually, the execution isn't all that bad, but the budget is often underestimated by a lot
* Our parliament (Stortinget) was supposed to renovate some adjacent offices they use on a 70 million NOK budget
Soon, more stuff got added on, most noticably a bomb proof delivery entrance
The final cost ended up being 2
3 billion NOK
* A diving platform was to be built on a beach in the city of Hamar in 2008 for 1
5 million
It was finished in 2014 for almost 26 million
* The Oslo Opera house had a budget of 750 million
It ended up costing 4
3 billion
* When the Oslo metro were to switch from paper to digital tickets in the early 2000s, development was slow and the entire project was replaced by another
The first project managed to spend 600 million on turnstiles which were never activated as intended
* There's tons of public IT spending which have gone to waste
It's impossible to keep track of all the failures, but we're talking tens of billions of NOK
I just don´t understand how hard it can be to produce some fucking IDs
It baffles me
My bank (DNB) still have picture ID on the back of the debit card they issue
It is quite an elegant solution, having the ID on somehting you have with you all the time
When travelling, it is always funny when you give them the card and they ask for ID, and you just tell them to look at the back of the Visa card :)
I HIGHLY recommend the podcast "how to fuck up an airport". It's in English, and debates all things that went wrong
My favorite is that they have to drive an empty airport express train regularly every to the airport to keep the track from going rusty or whatever
Even the train drivers find it funny to do that route,
The diving platform is my favorite
I wouldn't call Bybanen itself a badly executed project, but the extension to Åsane has definitely been a trainwreck
Not anymore
They changed it
Depending on when you got the driver license they last for 20-30 years
It's not just "some fucking IDs". There are lots of things that has to be in place before they can roll them out, like the IT part of it with chips can't be hacked and they should be close to impossible to pirate or fake
But yeah, they're long overdue
Not everyone has a driving license, I live in the middle of a major city and use public transport,  cars are expensive and heavily discouraged
They are yea
To be honest very few people doesn't own a passport and/or driver's license
Probably 97%+ of people own one or both but of course it's handy having something official that is primarly used for ID
Apparently they're figuring out every year that they're not secure enough and have to push them forwards
Seems strange though because rest of Europe has had functioning ID cards for a while now
Passports and driver's licenses are usually accepted as ID
In some cases it might only be passport
Where I'm from, you just take 500 kr in 2x4's and something to fix it to the ground
Of course it is not very straight forward
But two things: They have working on it for over a decade and just about every other country in Europe has ID cards
I would argue we are a pretty advanced country in most areas, so I really don´t understand how we can take this long
My mom has the early 1980's, huge laminated license, which would be valid until way in the future
She was stopped a couple of years ago, and the sweet police woman hadn't seen one of the laminates before
"But I can CLEARLY see that it's you in the picture, you haven't changed much in 35 years, so I'll just let you go on
Have a nice day madam
I haven't seen any stock piling from the grocery stores I frequent
But we are laughing a bit at those hording toilet paper
(Australians)
Only the face masks seem to be gone
People have panic bought masks and anti-bacterial wipes/gels/sprays etc
Personally I've bought some water containers for backup and have started buying my things that I use often, but 3 times
So instead of buying a 6-pack of beer, I buy an 18-pack
Coffee and toilet paper has always been stacked though
Not to prepare for a war or anything, we just drink a lot of coffee, and boyfriend got a shit load of TP since he saw it on sale and I happen to use it a lot
(Norway)
Shops are full and the all the toiletpaper is gone
We've had it for as long as I've lived, and after living in the US for a year I hate it
I never liked it before, but after, my gosh
There are already so many working on Sundays, why not let the stores be open as well
Skjønn is probably one of my favourite words in Norwegian
It means beautiful, but you can use it on things you find cute, nice, endearing, sweet and/or charming
Schemomedjamo means "to eat past the point of fullness because the food tastes so good
I feel so much Fernweh these days
I suppose the Norwegian version is "utferdstrang" btw, but that sounds more dramatic, like you want to leave forever and get a new life
I like bög cuz it’s what I’d think the swedish word for book is
jäg gillar bögar <— This boi’s clever
We say heimat, or heima for «being at home», in some Norwegian dialects, although those connotations are not something I recognize
Skjønn is also a feeling
It feels skjønt to take a dip in  the lake on a warm summer's day
In what language
Its considered kind of a «cheesy» word
Its probably best translated to «Adorable» which means roughly the same
Youll often find people describing babies or dogs as «Skjønn» or what they are doing is «skjønt».
Georgian, from googling it
I'm half-Indian, half-Norwegian
In Norway we have a female name called Randi, which means prostitute in Hindi
So that's weird
In India we have loads of weird names like Hardik
Which is also weird
Roger, sounds cool enough in English, but in Norweigan it's pronounced really flat and made fun of, like you're som hillbilly Truckdriver
I like it
>Old **slavic** names like Radomir, **Spiridon**, **Lukyan**, Svyatozar and so on
[Σπυρίδων] and [Lucianus] slavic names indeed
Brunhild is Russian too
I always saw that as a traditional Viking name
Svyatozar I agree on
The rest are fine
Always pick name foreigners have a slight chance pronouncing is my philosophy
Could you give some examples of these weird ones
> Hedda
That's a relatively common name here
That isn't the only thing he killed now is it
> Maicol, Braian, Gessica
And that's the spelling
Well, didn't Michael Jackson have a kid called Blanket
Mom came to work/study in Norway during a time when educated immigrants from India could come more easily in
Then the normal, girl meets guy, they fall in love, get kid etc
story
If I could have had a say though, I regret that she didn't choose the UK or warmer countries like Spain
While the standard of living here is excellent, it's different for one who is born and raised here
Most of us locals are soooo bloody sick of the shit weather and would like to leave
[It is a nice-sounding name] when pronounced properly
It sounds like Movicol, which is to help with constipation
My mistake
Meeting someone called Michael will never be the same after this
Cheese slicer and paper clips are probably the two most famous Norwegian ones
Actually in terms of "greatest" i’d say without a doubt artificial fertilizer
Without it the industrialization of the food industry would’ve been impossible
How the mighty fall
It's honestly surprising that the cheese slicer is not a global phenomenon despite its perfection
I would say fertilizer instead
For some reason most norwegians seems to think the paper clips are norwegian, when the’re actually american
Filling fuel in litres and converting it to mpg is so sad it's funny
The explosive whaling harpoon changed the world as well
Thank you for this
It's all we have
Please never talk to me or my country ever again
Pre-sliced cheese is expensive af
I pity that man
And the spray can and the gas turbine
And a common ticket system like airlines have
Imagining being able to purchase Oslo - Bergen, Barcelona - Madrid and Budapest - Lisbon on the same page
Imagine being able to purchase one ticket within Norway in the same ticket system with the same company
We can’t even do that anymore
Entur ;)
Hey hey hey, they don’t have a monopoly
You can always go to the airport and get into the tax free somehow to buy alcohol
It doesn’t work, they seem to only sell tickets for Vy
If you’re going with several companies you need several tickets and it often leads to higher prices, compared to before when it all was NSB
The conservative government has only created a train system producing more companies, more leaders, more multimillion class salaries, worse services and more hassle for the passengers, resulting in more car and plane traffic instead of by rail
Imagine if we could spend those money on improving the rail network instead, because that’s more necessary
Well, geographically you are not part of Scandinavia
Hm, I've used it for SJ Nord
But otherwise I agree
That's actually wrong
Scandinavia is, by definition, Norway, Sweden and Denmark
The geographic area that Denmark is not part of is the peninsula of Fennoscandia
The Scandinavian peninsula does not include DK
There is no "Scandinavian peninsula". The peninsula is called Fennoscandia
Scandinavia is Norway, Sweden and Denmark
We use the word Quisling on traitors
Beacuse a guy named Vidkun Quisling was the leader for for the facist party «Nasjonal Samling» during the war
And he betrayed Norway by cooperaring with the germans during the invasion and occupation of Norway
Kind of weird how people outside of Norway use the word Quisling, it is not commonly used here
WW2 is long gone, the feelings between nations are not affected by the war, at least not here
Life hack for travelling in France
Ask them if they speak your language and they'll be way happier about speaking English
Parlez-vous Norvégien
Non
Parlez vous anglais
No, thank god
Honestly when I'm in London I just assume people speak English and get right into it
Only i can think off are Conan exiles, Manual samuel and Among the sleep
Dreamfall probably
(And I guess I want to add the infamous The Secret World, that failed miserably)
That’s a far cry from every known game you have made
Listen only those makes it look like your gaming industry is going through a crysis
I would never have thought that those games are from Romania
I would never have thought that those games are from Romania
Ah yes, the floor above where they ~~commit genocide by throwing people in an oven and turning them into electricity~~ develop games
Isn't that
criminal
So we could legally serve her milkshakes with sugar isolated from semen
That's nasty
Looks interesting, but might be too creepy and scary for me
Unfortunally
I don't think anyone's critiquing the use of dubs when it's the only way one has to understand the medium
What's strange are those cultures where the norm is to dub everything all the time
Thanks Sweden for the cheap candy, alcohol and stuff in general
providing us with cheap food
and not passing us around like a bag of crisps anymore
I'd like to thank the swedes for cheap candy, alcohol and bacon
I'd like to thank the danish for having a funny language amd for having Lego Land so I don't have to travel a million lightyears
I would like to thank the ocean outside my house for being so full of oil, I live 10 hours from any neighbouring country and that's the way I like it
Just kidding thank you Sweden for our independence after 200 odd years
guess where I'm right now
stocking up the Pepsi Max storage
I second this
Things in Norway are so expensive it's depressing so I'm glad Sweden is just 1-2 hours away from where I live
Yep
A lot of people go to Systembolaget (state owned alcohol store) just to buy alcohol
However, people often combine the trip with buying large quantities of basically anything at the supermarkets
[Snus] is also a very popular thing to buy there because of the low prices
A 0
4L beer at a bar normally costs €10 and can often cost even more
It's very normal for a 0
4L beer to cost around €10 at a bar
It can get even more expensive some places
That's actually true for Norway as well, although we have higher taxes and fees than Swedes so our prices are generally higher
I've heard of Frenchmen coming here to purchase rare French wines because they're sold cheaper here than down there
Once you get to a certain price level (think thousands of euros) the fees and taxes can sometimes be outweighed by the sellers profit margin
Same applies in Karigasniemi and Nuorgam
Solo, the Norwegian Fanta, is some kind of national romantic drink
It just screams Norway
Urge (called Surge in many other countries, I believe) was much more popular here than anywhere else and is still in sale
The most popular one must be [Solo] soda, tastes miles better than Fanta imo
I think they did some aggressive marketing a few years ago abroad though
Apart from that some years ago (i dunno how it is now) Norway was the only country where [Surge] soda could be bought
It has been here since the mid 90's, since it was made here and known as Urge
I feel like a lot of Norwegian have forgotten about Tropo
A "tropical" soda that is really nice
In limited quantities
Urge which supposedly was a discontinued soda in america called Surge
Solo was the first thing I thought of
Would also say Villa and Mozell, though don't know if it's exclusively Norwegian
And then julebrus
And I guess Tøyen-cola
I hate myself for not liking Solo
I prefer Fanta
E. C. Dahl's Ingefærøl (ginger beer soda) is also amazing
Frukt is the champagne flavour from the local Tromsø brewery Mack, it's popular in the 3 northernmost counties
Hm, the most popular champagne sodas are Villa and Mozell, but I'm sure there have been many other variants, probably some of them chain-specific
That exact name doesn't ring a bell
Julebrus is a big one
Hamar Lillehammer rules ;)
I like Troika too
Many see it as an old person chocolate, never understood why :/
No worries, I hardly drink and sodas at all
But no brand all of Norway can agree on
Solo on the other hand
Are you sure you're Norwegian
I think Fanta tastes like sugar, and solo tastes like sweet sparkly oranges
And don't forget Fanta is a nazi-drink
Well
Not really, but kinda
Sorry
But civilisation was good while it lasted :)
I've changed my language settings to english because of this
Annoying as fuck
I haven't noticed anything
Maybe it's not available in Norway
Yes, I often can't actually tell what the video is about if I don't concentrate on reading the title in my own language
It has actually become a bit of a meme on the Norwegian subreddit
It started with someone posting an image of a poorly translated youtube title
It was written like really nice and polite in Norwegian so it's hard to get across how clunky it was
It was kinda like "The penguins of Madagascar may say the N word if they want
" and it has turned into this whole meme with people posting stuff like "jEg KoMmEr TiL å Si N oRdEt
Check out Sorted Food on your phone
I was so confused the first time I saw it
Immediately changed my settings
Even Mussolini’s granddaughter is a politician in a far right fascist party these days, and doesn’t even renounce her grandfather at all if I remember correctly
She even asked to be seated at his old seat at parliament
The most worrying part is that her party just keeps growing bigger and bigger
English
And while you probably didn't mean mobile games, they have a tendency to translate into Norwegian and it's just awful
Same with their adds and page in Google Play
It's obviously machine translated and looks bad and clumsy at best and makes zero sense at worst
Then again, play store won't even let me see reviews in languages other than my first language for some reason, despite it being spoken by few people thus few reviews, somehow thinking we are all too stupid to comprehend an English review or something
Sorry about the rant, but stupid things annoy me
English, because the game is often made in English, or the translation to English is better than the one in Norwegian
If the game was made with english in mind, I’d definitely prefer that
Other people have already pointed out how translations can be tacky and certain phrases and jokes does not translate well at all, but yeah that’s mostly my reason as well
Another reason is that norwegian dub voices are often cringy to listen to imo and they basically never fit the character
But then again, games with PEGI 16 and up are never translated to norwegian so I end up with english anyways
English
I think that is how I learned a lot of my English in the first place, and now it just seems a bit weird to me if the game is in Norwegian
I used to play the sims in Norwegian, but it was easier to just have it in English with my Tumblr blog
If a game automatically is in Norwegian and there's no reason for me to change it, I will play in Norwegian though
English
It just feels weird whenever they have translated things into Norwegian
I started off playing games in English, and have done so for decades
English pretty much always
Norwegian also often isn't available, I do play Football Manager quite a lot though which does offer Norwegian, but the translation isn't great so I tend to just stick to English
Given the game is good, original language is okay if english or norweigan, else english is preferable since translated words often feel reeeeaaally out of place
Exceptions is the 4th harry potter game, I loved that thing, and played it as a child in norweigan
Also the Sly trilogy, brings the nostalgia
That depends
When we got our independence the people living in the rural areas were the only ones who still spoke somewhat Norwegian
While cities had more of a Norwegian/Danish thing going on
Today "the farmer" is still something "typical Norwegian" but you might still get some shit for having an accent if you are from the rural areas of Norway
Tldr: Even though the farmer is "typical Norwegian", they are seen as backwards by some, but not a whole lot
(It is just banter)
You have Oslo and the rest of the country
Oslo thinks they rule the country while the country doesn’t like Oslo
Norwegian politics oversimplified
Haha, that's Trøndersk for you
I'm from Trøndelag, but even I might have some trouble with the more broader dialects of Trøndelag sometimes
But then again, as you mentioned, southern Norwegians seems to have trouble understanding the dialects around here more than anyone else
Something I actually have to consider at times when I'm talking to people from other regions
You: Jeg
The guy she tells you not to worry about: Æ
I speak English, Norwegian, and a little german
Never felt that it wasnt enough, it may be because I can understand Swedish which is the only other language than Norwegian and English I hear on a regular basis
I reappy wish I wasn't a lazy teenager back in high school
Had 5 years of german, and almost nothing to show for it
Sure, I can understand some sentences and probably make myself understood in simple conversation, but I realpy wish I had paid some attention amd tried learning it
Though, I don't know if I would use it enough for it not to be forgotten
I would also like to learn other languages like russian and arabic
I’m always curious to learn new languages, so it’s never enough
Probably helps that I dont travel much, I dont really need german, never use it
This is very common in Norway too !
We call them "snølykt" = snow lantern
Used to build them all the time as a kid
they are so pretty and fun to build
I did not know it was a thing in Finland too
that is pretty cool
I made lots of snow lanterns as a kid
Less chance of setting anything else on fire in the snow, so the adults lets us use matches without supervision
Ice lanterns however I didn't see until my children started making them at school
They put food colouring in the water to make them different colours
Yeah we used to build them a lot in kindergarten
The adults thought they were pretty and the kids would usually just help to build them
Now you can start a new tradition
The first part of the 2011 terror attack was an explosion against the main government building that left the area [looking like a warzone] Luckily it was after working hours in the middle of summer and only 8 people died
My heart goes out to Lebanon
Is that the ship whose anchor you can stumble upon hiking way up in the mountains
There is also the 1943 Filipstad explosion which ruined 400 buildings, killed 75 German soldiers and 45 Norwegians
That's not correct
His goal was to destroy the building which houses the Prime Ministers office (Høyblokka)
He did not succceed because he did not know about the underground tunnel under where he parked the car with the bomb
The building survived because It absorbed enough of the explosive force
Sweden: We love you just as much as Denmark, we just don't say it out loud as much
Finland: Europe would not be the same without you
You have a greater sense of humour than any country I know
Denmark: I miss visiting you in the summer
Best holiday destination in Europe if you have children
Iceland: You are mysterious and it feels like you are far, far away
And you have the most fascinating nature
Dear Russia
We know that one bad leader have put a lot of tension on your whole country, and we have treated you badly because of that
I really think that we could show better that we separate your population from your leader, and that we can have closer relations in the future
Sweden and Denmark, but no Norway
You’re not wrong
Not me, water is the best in my opinion
I love milk
If i wake up in the middle of the night, i take a glass of milk
It's difficult to imagine a life without milk
What else am I supposed to drink when eating bread
I drink approx
1 liter daily
I prefer the 1 % fat milk, called "lettmelk" or "light milk" here
It's the most sold variety
Yes, especially whole milk
Milk bars
hmm, perhaps a bit too Clockwork Orange for me
I don't drink that much milk, but there are some meals that taste best with a glass of milk on the side
I also drink milk when i eat snacks like chocolate
When im in southern europe i drink a lot more milk
For some reason i think it taste better there
The first time noticing this was in spain
It may have something to do with that we only have a few brands to choose from in Norway
Can not simply drink water when eating bread with cheese
I know Swedes are weird creatures but wtf man
There is this norwegian meal called "potetball" my grandma makes normally on thursdays and milk is the best option to drink on the side
By the way, I was in Tolo (Toyo) Greece for the third time in july and my favourite milk brand in greece is this one :
2011 and 2015, we stayed at hotel amaryllis each time
It's a long walking distance to the beach so i rented a moped :)
It rained a little this july, first time experiencing thunderstorms in greece
*Ut i Hutaheiti* \- "Out in Otaheite", an older designation for Tahiti
*Nord for folkeskikken* \- "north of common decency", in the sense that the place is both remote and "uncivilised".
In Norwegian you might use "gok". for example "langt ute I gok
Far out in gok
"Langt ute i Gokk" (Far away in Gokk)
I have no idea where Gokk is supposed to be, or where that word originated from
Langtvekkistan- translates to Far-off-istan
To refer to a place vague place very far away
>"Verweggistan", aka "Far-away-istan", is also a word sometimes used
Haha, we also say that in Norwegian: Langt-vekk-istan
I always thought it probably originated in a Donald Duck comic or something
Never heard "Nord for folkeskikken" before
"Gokk" is another word/name of middle of nowhere that came to mind
Der pepperen gror / where the spice is growing
Norway too
Dra dit pepperen gror:D
I was thinking Gokk or Langtvekkistan
Killing and eating whales
The Faroese and Japanese get way more flack than us
tbh if it's done humanely I don't see any reason why whales which are not of a threatened species should not be hunted like any other animal
But you have the coolest ship to cheer you up
HMS Dragon lookes incredible
Well, "facist" is still a popular word and Mussolini is the even shorter well known dictator from WW2, so you I say you still get your share
>Just name a thing Sweden gets either credit or flack for and it's most likely that also applies to Finland
Hot blond girls
The most beautiful in the Nordic countries are obviously Norwegians, but I have heard that Sweden send their ugly blondes to Finland
Might be a rumour
(It feels so wrong not to have Sweden being the butt of that joke
In Nordic banter, Sweden should be the butt of the joke
Obviously
Sorry Finland
Norway was not Danish territory in the viking age
That was a few hundred years later
As a Norwegian, I can say a lot of us gets pissed when people speak of Vikings as mainly Swedes, and a lot of what you just said also applies to Norway
When people get the Scandinavian countries mixed, Scandinavians gets pissed a lot of the times
I hope the taste was better than the visual image I have of that right now
> I think the Japanese blame is mostly because they often don’t eat them, just kill them in mass for sport
Where do they do that
"Damn Scots
They ruined Scotland
I thought making a fuzz about someone or a company not being PC when clearly making a joke was an American thing
US gets the flack for it, but Wales are there too I guess
This subreddit is about what countries get credit or flack for
So the question is why you thought this was something Switzerland should take credit for
I would belive Finland has the highest ratio of blondes
But the hot part
That said, I need to see a source to believe Baneken's claim
Because, according to statistics, half of the world's Finnish people are really bad at statistics
Yes, but is there reason to believe anyone pointing out they have a history of mistreating jewish people too was a camouflaged brag
"We were/are also racist especially in ww2 when we denied entrance for jewish refugees" does not sound like someone taking credit for anything
> I feel like a straight shot to the heart or brain and having the animal die instantly is more humane
The whales mostly do die instantly though
The harpoons are equipped with explosives to take out their hearts on impact
In the early 80's only 17 % of whales were registered to be dead within a minute, while more modern techniques have 80% die on impact, most others shortly after, and only 0,5% have to be shot twice
That's better numbers than the big game hunting that kills many more animals in Norway every year
I am sorry, I misunderstood you
I thought you meant it litterarily
> Turn it around: 20% of whales shot are in excruciating pain while being dragged by a harpoon for anywhere between 6 and 15 minutes until they finally die
(If we're going by the report your referring to, which only had a sample number of 50 whales which is not a statistically valid sample size)
1667 whales shot by the new grenades, vs 2106 whales shot by the old ones from what I can see, though I read a summary not the actual report
Probably not the same report either, since it mentions that of those 20% not killed instantly most were dead by 2 minutes, not 6 to 15
there is a law in Oslo that noone can build higher than this one particular building in the city center (I am not sure if Post Headquarters or Radisson Hotel, one of them
They stand in basically the same place )
For hide and seek: "Den som ikke har gjemt seg nå, må stå!" (Those who are not hiding now, will be standing \[implisit: here, in the next round\])
In Norway we don't say "ready or not, here I come", we say: Den som ikke har gjemt seg, den må stå. Which translates into: The one who hasn't hid must stand
Klar eller ikke, her kommer jeg
Are you gonna beat them with a shovel
Er d fortsatt noen i dette land som faktisk sier d å ikke bare roper d tallet de skulle telle til
I did see someone say "Barod neu ddim, mae'r helwr yn dod
Is that interchangable, or a dialect thing
Add a flair
Either way works
Not the same languages, but close enough
Norwegians, Swedes and Danes who live and visit between each other’s often/sometimes switch out words to be better understood
It’s especially usual for Swedes and Norwegians living in the one or the other country, maybe even more for Norwegians in Sweden, to swap some words
I think it’s totally okay and a bit funny, but also a bit unnecessary if we are aware of the differences and can understand each other without any further problems
I try to adapt when speaking with swedes and danes, while they do too
It feels like defeat to speak english with a scandinavian
It’s much easier, isn’t it
Don’t you have any language history in Swedish schools
I teach Norwegian at high school level in Norway, and language history is a fairly large part of the curriculum
The development from Proto-Norse, into old norse and then the modern languages
We read some simple Faroese, Icelandic and Sámi, and of course Swedish and Danish
We all know about the Swedish speaking population in Finland, as well as the tiny Finnish speaking population in Norway
Nou, jeejtje, je klinkt plotseling normaal
Wat geinig
Some of us try actually
I find it hard to believe that there are many Norwegians who don’t know about Swedish speaking Finns
Robert Stoltenberg’s [Piirka character] is one of many reasons for that
I don't understand how regular Russians can be duped into supporting a corrupt ex-KGB thug who's critcs tend to "disappear", end up in prison or "accidentally" die
You know something isn't right when people who criticise Putin keep "accidentally" falling out of windows
I don't understand how the Russian regime thinks they have a right to steal the territory of other countries (like Crimea), and stage fake elections "proving" their "right" to steal said territory
I don't understand how the Russian regime can say other countries who don't have nukes or nowhere near the same amount of troops as them (like Norway), is "threatening" a nuclear power like Russia
I can't understand why they would eat tacos on Saturday and not Friday
I can't think of anything
I do think it's strange that i've never met a finnish person
To my knowledge i haven't spoken to a finn online either
I don't even know what their language sounds like
The Swedish way of letting unelected bureaucrats (like Tegnell) make the decisions rather than the ones who where actually voted in by the public
It's the result of an alliance between the Christian political parties on one hand, and Labour on the other
The first drew inspiration from the American teetotallers, while the latter was more concerned with social issues
The policy came around during World War I, when food imports were scarce and there was a need to control the grain consumption
The result was strict rationing of alcohol
After the war, the policy continued both in Sweden and Norway
Sweden had a rationing system until the 1950s, and Norway had a brief ban on liqueur in the 1920s.
Sweden even banned sale of regular beer outside Systembolaget and restaurants
The policy was a bit laxer in Norway, but with big regional varieties
Some municipalities here were dry until the 1990s. The third largest city today, Stavanger, didn't even want a Vinmonopol, but a local referendum changed that in the 1960s.
The policy of taxing alcohol is even older, and goes back to the Napoleonic Wars
At that time both Norway and Sweden exported large amount of timber
Due to high demand from the shipping industry timber was even cut in the winter, and transported on frozen rivers with horse
The high demand created high wages, and imported booze was easily available
The result was that the logging industry nearly crashed due to excessive alcohol consumption
Loggers fell asleep in the snow, and horse drivers crashed and died
To mitigate this both countries levied import duties on alcohol, which have been in place ever since
In addition, restrictions on using grain for alcohol production came into effect, resulting in the widespread growing and consumption of potatoes as well as the potato-based liqueur aquavit
Lol people eat tacos all day of the week
I get that tacofridays are like our thing, but I don't think that many people actually follow this religiously like many seem to think
Most people I know have tacos whenever they feel like it
Huh, the swedes I've talked to said it was saturday
Didn't know grandiosa was popular in Finland
Thought only norwegians would like such bland pizza
We are the ones eating the most frozen pizzas afterall
It's probaly a lot of marketing behind the whole taco friday thing but it is a nice and easy meal to make for lot's of people
Yes, it is written in law by our king
It just has become a thing to have taco on fridays here
It's weird
We live so close but we know so little about eachother
I think i should visit Helsinki when this virus is over :)
Have you not heard of iced coffees
they are refreshing as hell
Its not like drinking hot cola, its like drinking iced tea
Yeah, religion isn't a consideration in that topic
[The same commercial in norwegian] its called Saturday pizza (lørdagspizza)
Amazing to see it in finnish
Correct
I actually don't personally know a single person who actually partake in religious practices
Maybe some believe in something supernatural, like a God, but they sure as hell don't actually care
Maybe you'll find a large percentage of practicing Muslims among immigrants with Islamic background, but that's about it, I'd say
We google things
And I hear teenagers say they will gmail someone
(We older people still call it email)
In Norway, Potetgull (lit
*potato gold*) is a brand of potato chips/crisps, and is now also the generic term
Correction fluid is almost always referred to as Blanco, although I've almost never seen a bottle of Blanco brand blanco
Gift means both poison and married in Norwegian
Its a bit funny
It's the same in Norwegian: "Drage" is the word for both a kite and dragon
Always enjoyed the word "esposas" in Spanish
We also use the same as you guys
Similar in norwegian, all tree things are called "krone"
Tourists have death wishes I think
Was in the mountains of Dovre with my grandparents to watch the [musk oxen] There was also a Dutch or German caravan there, and they went outside the car and took pics of the animals, even though they were really close
Even as a kid that seemed incredibly stupid
Guess they didn't understand animals can kill
Also was doing an 8 hour drive home, but got stuck in a queue of tourists wanting to see this one fjord
[Narrow road down a mountain] Down comes a dutch car at full speed, passing the queue on the wrong side of the road, barely slowing down enough for the tight turns
A wonder he didn't hit something
Chinese tourists eating smashed potatoes with chocolate sauce
This wasn't particularly dangerous, but
We were at a small hotel in Amsterdam, having breakfast
Another tourist - I believe he was British - came stumbling in
It appears that he had spent much of the night sampling the joys that Amsterdam has to offer after dark, and may or may not have actually been to bed that night
He walked over to the hot drink machine
Now, the machine was labeled in Dutch only, I must give him that
Still
He put a tea bag in a mug, moved the machine to the spout of the machine, and stared at it
HEET WATER, the button on the machine said
The tourist stared
Somewhere there must be hot water that would turn the tea bag into tea
HEET WATER
I honestly don't remember if he figured it out before we left the breakfast room
Perhaps another hotel guest, in a moment of kindness, or simply impatient to get a cup of coffee, helped him
Perhaps he is still standing there to this day, just trying to get a cup of tea
Walk normally on very slippery ice, resulting in them hurting themselves
German tourists going out fishing in a tiny boat in a storm
Chineese tourists walking into people's private gardens, taking photos through the windows
Tourists doing mountain hiking for several hours in ballerina shoes (or similar unsuitable hiking shoes)
People risking their lives taking selfies on the edge of very dangerous cliffs
That being said; 99,9% of tourists are all good
Trying to buy food with actual physical money
I mean, that's not considered weird here
Edit: Unless they were all standing on it at the same time
Sorry in advance
There are geysirs in Ireland, or were you abroad somewhere
The German exchange students I have met here seems to find joking about Hitler funny
Perhaps it's not the norm
I've been there
It is not an entirely unreasonable question if it was on the mainland or Lido, but I'm guessing that was not the case
Well, I've done that
To be fair though, the gravestone was almost 1000 years old and inscribed with runes, so might not be exactly the same
In 2012, four Swiss tourists and their French guide were killed in an avalanche in Lyngen
There were part of a group of 12 where two were guides
Thing is, it seems that though they all were experienced with conditions in the Alps, they did not consider that the mountain they were ascending is right next to the sea and that the additional moisture made the snow wetter and more prone to avalanches than they were used to
They had not consulted local guides
They thought the desert and dinner tables were the same
I think they were pleased believing it was some “Traditional Norwegian food”
very unactual digital money, by *tæpping* my phone or my card at the card reading machine
Ahh, makes sense
But considering giants causeway was magmatic or what it's called, I guessed maybe you still had some volcanic activity
I was in Hamburg right after the G20 riots and spent the night at the train station with some old alcoholics having an AC/DC karaoke night
Don't think I got to see the best side of the city to put it mildly
Damn, I can barely manage with a racket, let alone a staff
Not exactly
You have "landet" (the countryside), which means outside the cities
That one is value neutral
You also have the terms "utkanten" (outer edges), which is negative, and "gokk" (untranslatable), which is derogatory
Both of those basically mean far away from (major) cities
However the rural areas are pretty strong in Norwegian culture
Hmmm, no not really i guess people in oslo look down on everyone else and everyone else looks down at Oslo
"Nord for Sinsenkrysset", which means north of the Sinsen interchange
Basically the "border" where our capital Oslo ends and the rest begins
Used for a long time to describe that those in Oslo doesnt care much about what happens north of ut
I would like to add a saying: "Nord for Sinsenkrysset" ("North of the Sinsen intersection")
The Sinsen intersection was the first, large intersection in Oslo and back in the 1800's it was all forests and farms past it
Therefore, when people for example say "everyone north of Sinsenkrysset are farmers", they mean everyone outside of Oslo are farmers
This saying isn't really used too often, but most people still know about it
What
"Landet" as in from/"fra Landet" is not value neutral
In Oslo at least, saying people are from "Landet" is derogatory, it is implying he/she is a simpleton/naive person unaware of how city folks live and behave
In the countryside, "landet" might have a positive meaning
But in Oslo, if anyone says you are from "landet", they are  basically saying you are a redneck
didnt know gokk was derogatory lmao
I haven't, but a friend of mine who studies in Hungary was talking in Norwegian to her Norwegian classmate about how ugly the teacher's dress was
Turns out the teacher knew Swedish, which is close enough to understand
Karma imo
My mom has such a bad story about this kind of thing
She was in London when she was like 19 and on the tube her and a friend saw some people wearing really expensive jackets, so they were like talking down these people with the expensive jackets
As the person with the expensive jacket gets off the tube she says "It's so nice to hear Norwegian voices
" in Norwegian and walked off
Big oopsie
Not me, but I’ve got this one told to me from an Italian friend who’s been living in Norway since forever
He was walking up the stairs from a metro station in Rome right behind a Norwegian couple
They talked about what they had been doing in the hotel room the other night and what they planned to do when they got back
He said to them (or the woman specifically): “I bet you screamed a lot” in Norwegian
The embarrassment shall have been very visible
Can't say I've done that, but I talked with a random dude I met at a train station somewhere down on the continent in english for about 10 minutes before he asked me where I was from and I said "Norway", then he switched over to norwegian and said he was from Bergen
I don't find people in any country dressing that differently from the average Norwegian
But Swedish (city) men dress slightly better than Norwegian men
Some Finish ladies dressed [like this] I was also impressed at Russian ladies being able to dress really elegant in -25 degrees
And people outside the Nordic might dress a bit more formal for work
No I have never seen them do that
You can't really tell that someone is Romani in Norway unless they tell you
Right now: not at all
I've never casually just gone to Sweden as I live far from the border
However I have family who lives very close to the border and they go about once a week to shop, as groceries are (generally) cheaper in Sweden
Before Corona I'd visit Sweden once or twice every summer just to get some cheap beer and get away for the weekend
Back in 2011, I travelled to Paris, France by plane, carrying no other ID than my norwegian debit card (it has a picture of me)
Right now even going to Sweden for me as a Norwegian is not casual
But we have been able to casually go to Denmark for the last weeks since corona-borders were opened
I would say people close to Sweden might visit Sweden once a month
I live far away from the Swedish border so here people might go abroad on average twice a year (including outside Europe)
But that being said - I always bring my passport even within Schengen, but that is more for ID and banking purposes
As I never have to show my passport at borders
Because that's sooo far away
/s :-)
We went to malaga for a school trip, but it wasn't just like "hey, let's hop on a flight
" We all knew about the trip 2 years beforehand and planned it for about 4 months
Haha, that's funny
You have a beautiful country though
Once this coronasituation is over, Slovenia will be the first country I'll visit
I'm already looking at the maps and making plans, and a roundtrip from Ljubljana to Kranjska Gora down Soča to Piran and back to Ljubljana is only a six hour drive
Finally a country I can visit and make many stops along the road and really enjoy my time
You need to bring a passport when going to another country
You don't need your passport with you if you for example go from California to Nevada
How true is it that countries have different cultures, languages, laws etc
It's very much true
For example, we share a border with Russia (all the way up north in Norway) and I'd say our cultures/languages etc are very much different
I went to Finland about 2 years ago (who we also share a border with) . I did not understand a word of Finnish
Sure, Scandinavian languages for example are pretty similar, but not so similar that they're like dialects of the same language
That experience for me wasn't actually that much different from when I was an exchange student in the US
We planned a class trip to Mexico
Thanks for reminding me about Bohinj
I'll even add Bled to the list as well
We'll make a 1,5-2 week family vacation out of this
Also, two days will be spent in Planica (big fan of skijumping)
Aah, yeah we don't have a national ID
Apparently out government have been talking about developing one since at least 2012, but the re we are
Still no ID in sight
We don't have an ID card in Norway
The only valid Norwegian ID is our passports
Thank you
So many things to do
I'll save your post for further planning :-) Btw bograč... OMG that sounds delicious
In other countries: with a passport
IN Norway: with a driver's license or bank card (debit/credit card)
Well, I don't know anyone above the age of 12 who doesn't have at least a debit card
And I don't see why someone younger than that would need to identify themselves in Norway
I had a large offroad car that looked like shit
The grown ups in real cars definitely didn't wanna mess with me in traffic
Then I got a small but decent enough Polo, and I was completely invisible for other drivers
After that I got a grown up car, and my rights in the traffic was reinstated
I just ride my bike there on that one day in the end of July  when Centre is closed for traffic
Schlafrock
Of course it is
We call it «slåbrok», i guess it is the same etymology
I always thought it ment «wrapped (slå) pants (brok)», but sleeping dress is obvious
Thanks for new insight
Our word for taxi, _drosje_, comes from Russian _дрожки_ (dróžjki)
Most of us think of it as a native Norwegian word
Thank you
We say dørslag in norwegian as well, and it made no sense to me until now
> "through-hit"
Don't you use the word "slå" in the meaning to pour in Danish
At least we do in Norwegian
You can slå/helle/tømme vannet av potetene
I figured it was «slag» as in «omslagskjole».
The French word might come from the Norwegians/Danes who settled in northern France
It's "mur" in Norwegian as well, and most likely also Danish
I guess Polish
They are the single biggest immigrant group in the country by a wide margin
It's also the foreign language I notices the most when I am out and about
Swedish probably
Although it would be nice it if was Sami
Edit: Nope, its Polish
I think its German
In school, we have to choose a third language
The majority today choose Spanish, as it is seen as quite exotic, but Spanish is a recent addition to the education system
Before Spanish was added, the most common one was German and I think it still is the most spoken third language, although in the future it cold be Spanish
I was about to correct you since I thought it was Swedes, but according to [wikipedia] Poles are the largest group at around 90k, Swedes come second at around 40k.
And somehow, this has still not improved the sausage situation in Norway as much as I had hoped
Lithuanians have now overtaken Swedes too
See here for updated statistics:
Norway and Iceland are "flooded" with Poles, but for some reason there aren't *that* many in Sweden relative to their population
They have quite similar number of Poles as us despite having twice the population and they have many other immigrant groups that are much larger there
Yes, it does
Actually it more than balances it out
We get more bang for the buck than most countries except on a few commodities like alcohol and sugar
The narrative of Norway being extremely expensive to live in is completely false, but somehow is continuously repeated by both foreigners and Norwegians who don’t understand basic economics
Yeah, it’s definitely a complaining thing
Probably yes, but it’s more of a rural thing, I don’t know many who brew their own alcohol except for a few beer aficionados
Yes, people who live close to the Swedish border (which is a big portion of the countrys population) often go to Sweden to buy alcohol and candy
It is quite common to brew your own alcohol outside of the big cities
In Trøndelag it is quite common to brew brennvin (strong liqour) prefferably over 60% and add it to coffe to make karsk
I’d disagree
Or maybe it was just my class, but we all had broken the school network to our wishes, downloading Minecraft, fortnite and other stuff
One even deleted his remarks lmao
Well i really disagree as a fellow Norwegian
Its looked down upon, like the people who do it are problem kids or something
It might be more popular in larger cities I don't know
I actually have no idea
Never met anyone that I know have even tried it
(Obviously some might and never said)
But my guess is that alcohol is the preferred drug on the countryside, and cannabis might be more popular in the cities
I do wonder if the drug culture being small and looked down upon in the Nordics has anything to do with the happiness levels
You don't have to go too far in Oslo to get the smell of weed
Ocasionally smell it downtown in Trondheim or Bergen also, but as a person who used it before I guess I notice the smell quite easily
I think many people in our country looks down upon it, but it really depends on what group of people and what age
I feel like the younger generation are becoming pretty open minded towards it these days
From reading the answers I assume the Nordics is the only place in Europe where drugs aren't really accepted and are looked down upon
I dont think weed is looked down upon thar heavily especially not in younger circles
In general terms I agree, it feels like it is becoming more acceptable amongst the youth
Though, I have experienced younger people who really dislike it and think people who use it must have some kind of problem
Its funny how some people look down upon it while themselves get blackout drunk every weekend
I'm young and in my friend group weed is something only "narkomaner" does
So I'd say that outside friend groups who do weed it is looked down upon
Norwegian likes to reform the spelling of foreign words: x -> ks, c -> k/s, w -> v etc
This has also been done with names so now we have several spellings of names where one is the etymological spelling and the other is the reformed spelling: Christian/Kristian, Marcus/Markus, Nicholas, Nikolas
A lot of common european feminine names ending in a may in danish  end in e instead
Because Norway was under Danish influence for so long we also have these Danish versions as well: Maria/Marie, Anna/Anne, Julia/Julie
These two factors combined result in names such as:
Christina/Christine/Kristina/Kristine
Cathrina/Katrina/Cathrine/Katrine
Sophia/Sofia/Sophie/Sofie
We mix teach/learn (same word in Norwegian)
We also tend to forget to write for instance "can't" instead of "can not"
No, I've got it pretty good so I wouldn't ever permanently leave Norway
My husband and I are planning to move outside of europe in some years
He has Thai citizenship
We do live comfortable in Norway but we can live even better in Thailand
We both have family there, have careers where it's easy to get work and are learning the language
Very simply we want to move for better quality (save more money, be with family etc) of life
It seems a little backwards for some to move from Norway to Thailand lol
>Shout out to my ancestors for barely surviving on this hostile rock until modern technology made us prosperous
Ur welcome
Definitely
If you are fluent in English, Norwegian should be one of the easiest languages to learn
Almost, it's called jernbane - iron track
Interesting, we use sporvei/sporveg in Norwegian too, but only for light rail and tram
Edit: We have those others too
Normalspor, bredspor, smalspor
We also have jernbane though
Why are they simple
They are named after the place they’re in, which from my experience is the norm everywhere else as well
I guess in some metro systems (like in NYC and London) they are more often named after street names, which you won’t find in Oslo, is that what you are referring to
And by the way, t-bane is not considered to run on a railroad anyways
Never thought of that, but I guess they are
Yup, I said that in another comment, could have put it in here as well
Wouldn't bane be circuit
In Bergen, yes
The light rail system in Oslo is called "trikk", short for "elektrikk". It's a super old-fashioned type of word, it originates from when the light rail system was first electrified in 1894 (it used to be horse-drawn)
Ah Sorry, i didn’t see it
Same in Trondheim
No worries, neither am I! I was just wondering what exactly makes them simple
Yes, it's a big country with quite few people
In the east are mostly woods, but the rest is mountanious
We live quite spread out, so there live people here and there
It's easier to not meet people in the middle part of the southern norway and north of norway, i.e people live along the coast
The thing is, almost everyone in Norway owns a cabin in the mountains; so while you do see houses in almost every valley and mountainside, you can actually go for miles without seeing actual people, as most cabins remain uninhabited in the off-season
Very, very little
Some very small areas were you can be more that a few kilometers from structures, but not real wilderness
Its a tradgedy for sure, cause we have lots of potential
There is no movement here to protect the little we have, and a few decades all we have left is parks and agriculture
Last summer I went on a roadtrip with a few friends to roughly the middle of the country and we drove for an eternity with absolutely nothingness around us at one point
There are definitely countless of areas in Norway that are not equipped for civilization to take place
If you look at population density maps of the country you will also find that there are chunks of spaces where there are recorded to be 0-1 inhabitants and I have a feeling that there might be a geographical explaination for this
Oh yeah, if you get lost in the uninhabited part of the mountains, there is neither cellphone coverage or extensive rescue teams
Dont get lost
Problem is there are people everywhere
And we dont have real forests, its all for timber production and pasture for moose
But we could have had if there was a will to preserve it, and if people actually knew what a real forest looks like
There's a while lotta nothing over at you guys' place
“Don’t have real forest”
Breh have you ever been to Innlandet
I can assure you we got tons and tons of “real forest” here
Ooops forgot
Norway
Yes there are some tundra areas that are not so densley populated, Finnmark has many of them
But they are not huge, and its not very remote, there is human activity there
Im not sure how many places you can find 100km from a road, if any
There is a lot of details lacking from google maps, especialyy in places like that
I know we might have some more wilderness if compared to many other places in europe, bit its not really much at all
Very little is unspoiled, and only in small patches scattered around
Its sadly difficult to get lost and die here, unless you have an accident
Yeah there are many small patches of real forest scattered around, in very steep valleys and other places where its difficult to get the timber out
Im telemarking, have seen some
But they are tiny islands in a big sea of wood and moose plantations
So its not real wilderness, and its not really remote
Miljødirektoratet says we have 11,5 % "villmarkspreget" area,  a lot of this is tundra
Southern norway is less than 5%, this is including hardangervidda, so very little "villmarksprega" forest, and no really big continuous areas
Yes they are
You guys still have a lot of that
Take good care of it, when its gone its gone
Yes i see what you mean, and in some weird way we do
Thing is its not wilderness
The forest we have is farmland, its all maintained for economic purposes, and has a very low biodiversity
So its not really wilderness
Continental europe has bigger patches of real forest than we do
And we are not very densly populated, but unlike sweden and finland, people here live everywhere
So no mattrr where you go tjere is always roads and powerlines nearby
For prime minister, not much at all
For monarchy, I think there would be a lot of debate if let’s say Princess Ingrid Alexandra (future queen of Norway) were to marry or be involved with a foreigner
Now if the foreigner were from another monarchy in Europe it wouldn’t matter as much(especially if from the Swedish or danish monarchy)
Or if the person was from Sweden and Denmark in general(maybe even norther Europe), but if they were from Asia, Africa, southern America, northern Oceania and maybe even norther America, there would be way more debate
Especially if they were too have a non ethnic Norwegian appearance
But idk really
One of our princesses has an American boyfriend named [Durek Verret] who is a self proclaimed shaman
and she has faced a lot of criticism for the shaman part, not necessarily for his ethnicity
Very sorry for the Norwegian link [daily mail article about the same guy]
Our next head of state, Crown Prince Haakon, was already born in Norway
Even the next after him,  Princess Ingrid Alexandra, was born in Norway
So it is highly unlikely that our next head of state will be born in an other country unless something revolutionary happens
Our kings's grandparents came from UK and Denmark
Was never an issue
Our head of state is the grandchild of an immigrant family from Denmark
Head of state = president/king
Head of government = PM
Klassekampen
At least I think they come the closest
Traditionally the Norwegian government has been very supportive of the newspapers
It’s pretty much the same over here, including the no one cares bit
England
We used to go there on
urhm
holidays
Sweden and Denmark
But we are more like brothers than friends I guess
Finland and Island are our cousins, so very much part of the family
Either Norway because we kind of emerged from them by mitosis, or Canada because a bunch of Icelanders were lured there by Mormons in the 1800s and never came back
They set up camp forever, and now Canada has Icelandic settlements
Young Canadians (and to a smaller extent, Americans in the northern Midwest) with Icelandic heritage are becoming increasingly interested in their heritage, and vice versa, so there's a lot of connection between the two still
Uhhh
Us and the US have been allies since ww2 2but that's not too long I think
Only one I can come up with
I always thought germany and france were the best of friends
Fine
Then we will be friends with Denmark instead
Well, could’ve been Denmark, could’ve been Iceland as well since we founded the place
Denmark ruled Norway for 400 years from Copenhagen, so I don’t know if we can say we have been friends for a long time
The same goes about you as well, we are friends now, but once upon the time you were our greatest fear
Same story about us and UK too, we were their darkest nightmare, today we are close friends
More you guys realy, Denmark kind of fucked our culture from 1397 to 1814 and you can still see the hushed resentment in our history books
Well, the period Denmark ruled over us is called "the 400 years night" so you might be on to something
That being said, I don't think anyone seriously hold any grudges or anything like that  towards Danes, that would be straight up stupid
Swedes on the other hand
The norwegians went mostly to Scotland and Ireland (and obv all the smaller islands), it was denmark that conquered England proper like /u/Junelli suggests
I don't mind honestly
I wonder if Island sometimes feels a bit alone in the world
Ah, okay, I just misunderstood a bit
A t-shirt saying "New York" or "Chicago" or some other city name is more common
That's the correct answer ️
Our jokes usually make fun of Swedes and/or Danes
Most of the jokes make fun of Swedes
For example this one: “Hvorfor sitter svensken på do med døra åpen
Fordi han er redd for at noen skal se gjennom nøkkelhullet
(Why does the Swede sit on the toilet with the door open
Because he is afraid of people peeking through the keyhole)”
I want to move into germany now
It's not the main source of day to day humor (at least in the west)
We are mainly sarcastic and don't take ourselves that serious
However, a good chance to laugh at a Swede is always fun and we do love word plays and dry jokes
I don’t know
It is just the first type of jokes that I think of
Can confirm
None of my children know a single Sweden joke
Im 23 and I grew up with them
Gult regn i Kina var favoritten i barnehagen
Totally unrelated, but the TV drama Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip starts with a fictional TV shoe producer having a meltdown on love television
Good series
I hope other Norwegians can back me up because I'm on mobile and not bothered linking
But the falling man mountain
I think that's the name
It's a mountain where everything thinks it will fall at some point
The running joke is that he hasn't. There's a whole website dedicated to 'is it still standing
People from Bergen and how generally obnoxious we are
Yes
Mainly Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, UK
But also France and Germany
And of course whenever an event in a European country makes Norwegian news
Like most recently the Croatian earthquake or the Italian mafia trial
I keep up somewhat with Swedish politics because Sweden is similar to us, I often visit Sweden, and I understand the language
It's very entertaining, especially debates are fun to watch
Its in the same way a lot of people follow US politics, but not that extreme, at least yet
Nrk is prty unbiased
I have felt safe wherever I have been
But I guess some of [the mountains] can be scary if you are not an experienced climber/hiker
Oh, how interesting
Tell us more please
What where the tunnels used for, and why are they connected to so many houses
My man and I saw this in a special episode of Ghost Adventures and we were really intrigued
Especially by that circle in the middle of the woods where nothing grows
We really wanna check it out, but Im sort of a wuzz and Im not sure I have the guts to actually check it out, Especially not after dark, but it's a fun thing we talk about whenever we go down that route
> Villa rašica is a villa where satanists are doing their rites and sacrefices
Why there
Looking at [photos] it seems an unlikely location
Unless I am looking at the wrong photos
Oof, my class went on a trip with the White Buses foundation in 10th grade to Auschwitz, both the camps, Sachsenhausen and Ravensbrück
It was a mess of a trip since barely anyone in my class got a long, so there was a lot of drama on top of the actual trauma of seeing these places
I prepared myself a lot in advance by looking at pictures, documentaries, reading stories of survivors, including the story of one of my best friends' grandfather who was Polish, who was forced out of his home when the nazis came, and witnessed the murder of his grandfather when he refused to give up the family farm
I thought I prepared myself a lot, but nothing could really prepare me at all for what we saw
I can still smell the tons of hair we saw, still feel the heaviness of the areas, still see worn down stairs, the walls where they executed prisoners where you could still count the bullet holes, and the scratches on the walls in the surviving gas chambers
Names were scratched into the areas where they slept at night
I had nightmares for several weeks after and was unable to get any decent sleep
It was hands down the most horrifying trip of my life
We had a survivor with us on the bus who had been in Sachsenhausen who shared his story once we entered Sachsenhausen
He walked the same exact paths where the nazis ordered him to walk as punishments for whatever, explained in detail how the whole thing was
Im not sure I would have that kind of strength after surviving something like that
When we came to Ravensbrück, we met another White Buses tour from Norway, who also had a witness who had survived Ravensbrück
We swapped witnesses for a while so our guy could tell his story to the other bus, and their woman could tell her story to us
They had one of the massive tools standing outside the entrance and she actually used that same thing as a work tool when she was imprisoned there
That thing was bigger than her by a lot and she explained that they were at least three people at the time to push it around and of they werent fast enough, they'd be very physically punished
She told her story without even a glimpse of negative emotion
Like it was something everyone survived
Normal
I still think about her, and our own witness
I dont think I will ever be able to forget that trip
These camps
The omnious feeling, even a feeling of despair
Every time I think back on that time, I end up being stuck there for hours, sometimes even days, just remembering all the smells, the sounds, the feelings I had when we walked through the camps and learned of all the extreme torture that happened there
It goes on and ond, just like this post Im writing now
and then I always end up frustrated that no words will ever explain those feelings and those terrors
In retrospect Im somewhat glad to have seen it, but Im never gonna go back there
Ever
I was thinking about north eastern Svalbard
Far away from any sort of help, cold, dark and lots of polar bears
I think there is a troll cage in Hardanger, and another troll cage in Jotunheimen
I hear they ate a journalist once, and probably some German tourists
True
And the part of Antarctica which we have claimed can also be kind of scary, especially in winter
The [Bouvet Island] can probably also be quite a scary place
Do you know how old the tunnels are
Or, do you know how old your house is
Interesting that they still exist so many years later
Nice, thanks for that info
That suddenly made this trip a bit more realistic to try out
That's the part that gave me nightmares
The fact that people can be that evil
I still have them from time to time, if something on the news is bad enough
We seem to get so desensitized to evil these days
But this kind of evil still exists
People who just follow orders from evil people without questions, just like so many did during ww2
I wish it was more accessible for everyone in this world to see these horrific places first hand
Even the hardcore tough guys in my class struggled to maintain their composures in some of the camps
Especially as we entered one of the surgical suites where Dr
Mengele ordered his experiments
I dont think it was his main surgical suite, but he was there
I eventually had to leave that room
I tolerate a lot of gore and ugly body stuff, but to know that these poor victims had forced surgeries they didnt need without any anesthetics, sometimes even have live animals put inside them
To know all the gory details people had to live through, as I eventually found myself placeing myself inside their heads, thinking about how they must have felt
It was too much and I had to get myself away from that before I passed out
Sorry, this got long again
I just find it hard to leave those places in my mind whenever I first go there
I tried to say that I wish everyone could see these camps so that everyone is more aware, so we can say never again, and actually mean it
Never again will we as people stand for hatred, never again will we put people through all that hell
But as a people of this world, so many still fuel hatred, still torture people, still comitting genocide
It scares me, and it breaks my heart
Humanity is capable of so much good, yet so many choose to do evil
I used to want to be a writer actually, but it's probably not in the cards for me
I ramble too much
Haha
Being used as a escape route makes sense
Thanks for checking
Very, by the time I could legally buy liquor (20) I could barely stand it anymore
When I was in high school I could chug a pint of vodka like it was nothing, but when I could actually buy myself, my binge drinking days were already over
Very popular, but it is declining
Following a trend in the western world where the youth drink less, less partying, has less sex etc
And at the same time rate of depression and anxiety has almost doubled the last 10 years
Poor kids need to get of SoMe and get some moonshine
Very common
I was about to lecture my 16 year old little brother for drinking at parties, but then i remembered that i started drinking at 15 myself
Very
we usually start around 14 in small amounts
like two beers and possibly some liqour
then it increases massively during 15 and 16 and takes off completely during 18 when we have our Russ celebration
There’s no drinking age in Norway or Denmark
There is however an age limit on buying alcohol
You cannot give alcohol to minors in Norway, so I'm quite sure Norway has a drinking age
Well, there’s no official law stating one
But because of the laws saying you can’t buy until you’re 18, combined with not being able to legally give minors alcohol, it makes the unofficial drinking age 18
Which is different than in Denmark
You know what I meant FFS
It makes little difference for Norway if the ruling party is the largest left party or the largest right party
There are differences, but they are minor
Which is great in my opinion, since then there is less chance they will run our country into the ditch
The smaller parties also have power, since neither of the large parties can rule without support from some of them, which creates extra balance
This is pretty much like Norway, except our Centerpartiet is not about environmentalism, it is like a populist farmers party that likes public spending
And our Kristdemokraterna is a party in the centre, recently had a fight if they should support the socialdemocrats or the conservatives
It has traditionally been a conservative party, but party leader wanted to lean towards the left
The majority of the party didn't, but it is a split party
Our Vensterpartiet is a green libertarian party, leaning conservative
Discord
I'm guessing the gamers in here knows what it is
For everyone else, it's basically an application for voice/text chat mostly used by gamers
I think Discord is a great app and and the developers are even better imo
I've paid for Discord Nitro for some years now, and every month they send a nice e-mail saying thank you and throw some funny jokes in there as well
In addition, they send free gifts whenever they can
Recently I received a  months Xbox Live Gold Subscription free of charge from them
And also a 3 months free Nitro subscription I could give to anyone I want
Think they do nice and good business with their customers
Perhaps boringly we can say the virtually direct translation "Greit nok
" "Greit" meaning "fair" or "ok" despite probably sharing etymology with the English "great"
Is romanizing δ as ð a cypriot greek thing
Well my fellow countryman, that might be that the English thought themselves great, but by viking standard they where "Greit nok"
Lol hør, hør bror
Føler ofte at de fleste aldersgrupper bare bruker og blander engelske utrykk - fair enough / whatever / oh my god / shit / no big deal osv er blitt en del av språket
Ja det er blitt litt sånn, men føler ikke det er så negativt, språk må jo utvikles av de som bruker det
Og om det da blir nærmere engelsk så blir det jo bare lettere å bli tospråklig
Weeell, every norweigan teacher I know openly despise the use of foreign words, and we have more than enough people wanting to make foreign words into norweigan
It feels a bit worthless tho imo, we are less than 5
5 million people, we are litterally less people than some big cities, and we need to adapt to stay relevant in global trade anyway
And while I don't think many norweigan people think of our language as "danish with norweigan pronounciation" before we're thought history as teenagers, it sort of is
We all have to trade something away to streamline and become a more complex and global society
Like a minor state in civ 5, you don't play to conquer, you play to prosper and ensure peace
Traditionally a woman took her husband's last name, and their oldest children inherited the first name of one of the grandparents
Nowadays you can choose more freely (although there are names you are not allowed to call your children
"Hitler" would be one example)
So most people have 1 or 2 first names, and 1 last name (but sometimes 2)
Some years ago I had a summer job at a travel agency
And quite often I was booking tickets for a family where for instance the father had one last name, the mother another last name, 1 child had the fathers last name, 2 children had the mothers last name, and then the youngest child had both last names
So divorce and remarrying can make things more complicated name-wise
It depends
Middle names or two surnames are quite common, and many kids adopt both of their parents’ surnames
Only sometimes the kids only adopt one of their parents surnames
I had a friend who inherited both of her surnames from her father so it can change
Usually, wives take their husband’s surname too
I would be dead
I was born with a hole in my heart
I needed surgery
As the oldest son, I would we working on my family's farm
I would probably be a sailor or logger in the woods until i caught pneumonia and died from that
Thank modern medicine for antibiotics (and we're fucked when all bacteria get resistent \*glancing angrily at doctors with loose antibiotic practices\*
My family were merchants, so I guess I would be that too
I would have been rather excited about our new, enlightened, constitution of 1814, but I hope I would have been a little skeptical of the paragraph that said Jews weren't allowed to enter the country
I would also have been somewhat annoyed that the British pressured Denmark to give us away to Sweden as part of the aftermath of the Napoleonic war
Been independent from Denmark for 5 years, so I could’ve used my flair on Reddit, if Reddit was around in 1819
Depending on where my ancestors came from, I would either be a fisherman living on the coast, a farmer in the countryside, or working in a workshop in the city or a city-boy going to sea
I don’t think I would live in 1819, but it would be pretty cool to see the world back then without modern infrastructure or buildings
It would be pretty cool to see London in 1819
Thinking about the world in 1819 makes me wonder how it’ll be in 2219
Honest, I like it
In Amsterdam by the red light district, IF you pay enough
Nowadays everyone will say the North Pole, inclusing me
My hometown of Drøbak, Norway has a Santa Claus
There is a 'julehus' (Christmas house) here that sells everything related to Christmas
He has an office in Drøbak and receives a ton of mail from kids worldwide every year
Here in Norway we say that he lives on the North Pole, which I thought was the normal in most countries
I didn’t know Danes says the he lives on Grenland but it makes sense
It would have been very cool if we also reffered to more specific areas like Antartica beacuse we control a part of that area
The North Pole, alternatively a mountain or hill near you, but officially residing in Drøbak
We're a little confused about the whole Santa Claus thing
We used to leave porridge etc
for the local
creature
and it sort of merged with the German/American Santa character
So in a sense, Santa lives on each farmstead, underground with the other elfs/goblins/undead
Well what i was told as a kid was that he lived in Svalbard, which is a Island north of Norway
If it is the American one it is on he north pole, but we also have like «farm santas» that are supposed to be very short and wear traditional wool clothes, they help out around the farm, and live in the barn
We don't have the american Santa Claus, but our "Santa" or julenisse lives in either Drøbak or Longyearbyen in Svalbard
So, this boat, how many horsepowers does it have
I've never met a Norwegian kid who says Drøbak or Longyearbyen
It's always North Pole
Huh
Jesus is a girl in Austria
First time I hear about this
We also say «nisser» like the american one is «nissen» (The santa)
But yeah famr santas are nisser or gårds nisser (just farm santas)
That is because they watch the american movies
Then why the carrot for the horse
Ah ok
How interesting
Having Santa Claus as his helper
I have a 10 year old who is about that height, so "baby" Jesus is stretching it a bit though
Of course, I thought maybe the boat was drawn by horses
Isn’t that one of the pretty standard stories
Like Santa parking his reindeers at the roof and climbing down the chimney
Why Spain btw
I was once asked «at what time do the fjords open
». Left me quite confused
1) Polar bears
People think they’ll see polar bears in the wild if they travel to Norway (and they often do not know that Svalbard is a thing, so that is often the cause of confusion)
2) That we’re very proud of our viking heritage
Yes we have lots of museums and a decent sized re-enacting community, but the average Norwegian will be clueless if you ask them about the viking age
3) That you will see northern lights, no matter where in Norway you are
Sorry, nope
Have to be faaar up north and in the right season to have a chance at seeing any, and you still might not
4) Tourist ask when the fjords “open”. No joke
They expect some guided, sweat free fjord experience
Im half Australian, half Norwegian, have lived extensively in both countries, always got asked the bog standard questions growing up
Does everyone have a pet kangaroo that they ride to school/work
Do polar bears wander down the street
Are you in porn
Talked to someone on a discord chat about going on a boat trip this summer
they didn’t think it was possible because "Norway is covered in ice"
Tbf, there are polar bears in Norway, just not on the mainland
I've also heard that some people get angry/disappointed when they realize the midnight sun is the same sun as the "normal" one
Hey now, you don't have to be *that* far north for a chance at northern lights
I've seen them in Møre og Romsdal
Ah, the good old "I'm coming to Oslo in august, any chance I'll see some northern lights
> Are you in porn
wat
Møre og Romsdal is quite far north for most southerners lol
I’ve seen them in Oslo too, but I have had tourists visiting my restaurant (in Asker), wondering when they were going to catch some northern lights
Yup
Been asked that a few times actually
And no, I don't dress or act overly sexual
Australians are quite conservative
Scandinavians are seen as being quite liberal, especially sexually (which, tbh, is true
At least in comparison
But Aussies aren't prudish by any means)
I think this stems from old stereotypes from the 70s and 80s, when Scandinavia went through a sort of sexual liberation/revolution
That image sorta stuck internationally
Pair that with the fact that I look like a typical Scandinavian, I guess I fulfilled a certain
fantasy
I mean, this was during the age of American Pie foreign exchange student vibes type stuff, so there was a culture of it
That's what I've assumed over the years, in any case
But yeah
been asked quite a few times, or had other weird sexual comments made once my nationality is brought up
Scandinavians are definitely sexualised overseas
I think its generally the most popular pasta dish in europe seeing how easy it is to make
Not even ready made it takes me 25mins to make the sauce obv its not "real"
Døgn
As mentioned by some scandi folk above
Why on earth doesn’t it exist in English
I also find myself lacking when I want to talk about Pålegg
It’s the stuff that goes on top of your slice of bread
I know the word “spread” exist, but Pålegg includes everything you put on your bread
Ham, sousages, cheese etc
Skadefryd is another one
In English, they use the German word
They should have their own
Pålegg
It’s used for everything you would put on bread
Cheese, ham, jam, peanut butter, nutella, pattés, mayo
It’s all pålegg
Skadefryd, it means the same as the German schadenfreude
It's such good word
We have an expression with it too "skadefryd er ekte fryd" or "skadefryd is real joy" I use it alot
In English, the gender neutral pronoun is «they», which I always have found weird
In Norwegian, we have han (him), hun (she) and hen (gender neutral)
We have "oversiktlig" too
Ordered, well structured, easily understandable
That’s funny, kinda sounds like ‘castled’, like as if you’re in one
I guess in Norwegian it would be "Koselig" or "Hyggelig"
In Norwegian we use something like «oida» for the English «oops
», like if you suddenly fall or something, we can say «oida».
Well spotted
Interesting, we have "belegg" for that, it means something on the surface, like a type of waterproof coating on a floor would be "gulvbelegg", it has other meanings aswell, as it can be used as the English word proof: "You have no proof of that claim" Norwegian: "Du har ikke belegg for den påstanden". It's also for a group of people occupying a vehicle, gathering hall etc, or hotel rooms
Not sure if English has a specific word like that, it would be used like so: "The hotel will have new guests occupying all the previously used rooms" Norwegian: "Hotellet har fullt belegg"
Most times when languages borrow words from each other, they make their own pronunciation or spelling of it, so it’s a little integrated in the language
The Norwegian word Vindauga is not pronounced or spelt Vindauga when an English speaker is talking about their window
You say window
As a non-native speaker, whooping out a German word (with German pronunciation) when I’m trying to speak English, screws up my flow
Having an English word, that fit in a little better, would help a lot
I'm not native but does that specify which kind of relationship it is
Married
Engaged
Or just a boyfriend/girlfriend
Kæreste is very specific and means boyfriend/girlfriend
Yeah but it's not very English is it
It sounds so out of place every time I read it, or is that just me
You sound so offended
I think you are completely missing my intent with the original comment
There is a difference between using English words as an established slang, where you choose to use English because you can - and not because you have to
Being fluent in Norwegian, and decent in English, most Norwegians find it easy to switch between the two when they’re joking around
In terms of schadenfreude, I have to dig up a memory of a third language I don’t speak, because there isn’t any English alternative
So I’ll repeat myself; English should have an alternative
Because English is such an elaborate language and schadenfreude is such a legit feeling
I am legitimately surprised English doesn’t have their own word for it
Same with Døgn
And Pålegg
The whole point of “which word from your native language did you wish could translate perfectly in English but doesn’t” is to state what words I wish could translate perfectly to English, but can’t.
Some things doesn’t translate directly or perfectly
That’s the point
Different words or phrases that kinda mean the same, but lack the precision we are used to in our own language
I am able to make myself understood even if I can’t use the words I mentioned, but I sometimes wish I could just say døgn and have people nod
[Galleri Oslo ] is officially the ugliest building in Oslo, built as an indoors shopping street in the 80s as motorways were built in the city centre
Personally I would like to nominate [the new National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design] and [the new Munch Museum ] as well
This supposed museum or whatever it is
I'm between speachless and "haha, what, why
" and "I would really like one in my neighborhood
This phenomenon must have a name
This breaks all standard "rejuvenation of old architecture" that I've ever seen before
I don't hate it though
No offense, but you guys are morons
That new place looks like a prison
I can not believe that the council allowed tearing down a beautiful historic building to build a brick there
I won't argue that this hasn't happened in Norway, too
Probably lots of examples if we dig through history and old pictures
Yes, we have a class about the core concepts of each major religion and some ethics
With all the conflict created by religion in the world, I think it's important to know something about it
Yes we do
We learn christianity mainly beacuse it’s our state religion and other religions too see the world from other viewpoints
Yeah
They do it so we are more educated on other religons, and so we stay safe out in the world and are respectable towards others :)
When I went to school, we had RLE (name of the subject), mixing religion, lifestyle and ethics into one subject
I’m very happy with the way it was taught; we weren’t taught that any one of religions was the answer - it was far more general and we learned what people believe, why etc
Then lifestyle and ethics were two different categories on the side
I’m surprised some people don’t see the need for kids learning about religions
Religion is a big part of many cultures and have affected history, and still is affecting the world
Of corse kids need to learn something about it
Many kids will also encounter people of different religions, obviously it’s not great if the only things they have heard about those religions are biased stuff from internet (or their bigot parents)
What I don’t like, is too much focus on one religion, like ~~Christians~~ Christianity (autocorrect) here (I didn’t feel like it was too bad when I was in school, but I think it’s changed a little)
Perhaps those from other countries, that oppose teaching religion in school, are from places where they mostly just focus on the country’s religion, because that just sucks
Like you mentioned we also learned ethics
And we also learn about other beliefs/views, that aren’t  religions, for example putting the humans, rather than religion, in the center
Pretty much the same here, but i feel like it was like 30% philosophy and life, and 70% religion
Its called KRLE now, being more focused on christianity, at least in ungdomsskolen, but videregående has religion
When I was in school it was called KRL (Christianity, Religion and Lifestance), then it was changed to RLE (Religion, Lifestance and Ethics) to de-emphasize Christianity, and with the current government they renamed it KRLE (Christianity, Religion, Lifestance and Ethics) to appease small religious fraction that's part of their base of power
Throughout the contents have been similar though and it's always been about what people believe rather than what you should believe
Tell him that the reason there are so many electric cars in Norway is because they're so quiet that you can get inside your house before the polar bears notices you getting home in rural parts of the country
Tell him that he must ask the waiters/bartenders for permission before going to the bathrooms
Everyone you meet must be greeted with a kiss
Tell him that we normally don't ride polar bears to school/work in Northern Europe :)
Just go to the bank and get one
"Take to hold"? So you're saying in the Rhineland the guy will hold your dick in his hand for how long exactly
I’m terrible at eye contact, I’m from Norway
Trondheim
It´s more in the middle of the country, the third largest city and has been the capital once
But the people of Bergen would want to kill me after
Trondheim
It has acces to sea like Oslo but it’s in the middle of the country and it is a historically important city for Norway, but mostly beacuse I live next to it
I wouldn’t want to move the capital I think Oslo is a good enough place for it
Trondheim I guess
It's in the middle of the country and historically it has been our capital
But that was 800 years ago
I'm happy as long as it's not Bergen
I was going to suggest the same city
Trondheim's central placement in the country would be a nice benefit
I think it’s pretty much ripped off lol
In the norwegian translation the city’s called Tronsheim, and it sent me for a spin the first time I read it
I think we depend more on the EU than EU depends on us
We only have oil, which the world hopefully will need less of, and fish
We’re not important what so ever so you are more important than us:)
Yeah, it’s stupid
I would much rather be fully in than halfway in (no sexual pun intended)
But this is an extremely unpopular opinion here
Something about sharing oil and fishing rights which may or may not be an actual problem depending on who you ask, and besides people don’t really care about the EU membership issue anymore
We do have hydropower, but I don't think we produce enough electricity to be considered important
We are definitely storing energy as well
We have many dam reservoirs which are filled up during low demand periods and used to generator more electricity in high demand periods
The positives FAR outweighs the negatives
I have a child who was born with a condition that causes us to call the ambulance quite often
(Last time was one month ago)
So in total he has been submitted to the hospital around 10 times the last couple of years
Ambulance every time, except once when he was transported to the hospital in a ambulance helicopter
No out of pocket cost for any ambulance, helicopter, any of the hospital stays or his prescribed medicine which is gets everyday
Neither have I lost any income over this
At the moment I get paid a full salary (same as I got when I worked) from the government as he can not go to child care at the moment due to risk of (any) infections
Can some things be improved about our healthcare system
Sure
Am I happy with it overall
Very much so
Greetings from Norway
It's harder getting access to the newest within medical research
You're kind of stuck with the standard treatments, so whatever new breakthroughs within medical science may not be available to you
It's still worth it though in my case, as I was born with a heart defect and went through open heart surgery as a newborn
Without universial healthcare, this would have been really costly for my parents
Although the doctors I've had through the years have been great, there are drawbacks such as things they just never told me about my condition, that I had to find out on my own by reading about it or talking to other people with cognital heart defects
I don't know if the same would have happened if I had private healthcare
Like I said though, it's still worth it
Any drawbacks are minimal compared to the money my parents would have to pay for my surgery
Well yeah you're gonna have to pay for other people's Healthcare
And a fact not much discussed, is that the people who need the most healthcare, is not the ones contributing the most
Chronically ill people who don't work for example
Me personally have no problem with this, but I could understand if some would
In Norway we also have things like sex-altering surgery on pretty young people, and gastro surgery sewing the stomach up so fat people can't eat as much
Both those things could be discussed if should be covered imo, when dental isn't.
Yeah please don't go to the emergency response unless it is an emergency
If you have injured your shoulder, and have to wait 2 months for the surgery - will you then get paid sick leave in Finland while waiting for the surgery
> Slightly higher taxes
Well, in the US they pay about double the taxes towards healthcare compared to Spain
[(Numbers are adjusted to purchasing power
)] Edit: Dark green is taxes
Light green is private cost
The countries I know of using health insurance instead of "government insurance" are the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany
But there could be more countries I'm not aware of
Its free, or almost free, at the point of use
Same as the police and fire service
Isn't there a court case going on as we speak about the opioids epidemic
As a person who's dad died of a heartattack (the 6th one, no less) i'd consider all kinds of immediate chest pains an emergency, and it seems the ambulance personell agreed with you on that
The truth though is that someone comes first no matter what
In a private system they'll just be ordered by ability to pay rather than severity of the case
> as if I didn't wait 3 hours in an ER for my broken ankle, or 4 days to see my family doctor, or 8 months for a "new patient appointment" at a new family practice
As a comparison I have never waited longer than 30 min in ER, 2 days to see my family doctor (I get to see one of her colleges if its urgent and I need a same day appointment)
(Norway)
What the US has going for it though is cancer treatment
You have the highest survival rates in the world
Ok, so if you can't work then you get paid sick leave
My point was that European waiting times for surgery has a lot less negative financial consequences than in the US
In the US you might have to wait only 2 weeks for your surgery, but you loose 2 weeks + 2 weeks recovery time of income
I though they didn't, but that the government sponsor low income people so all citizens can afford healthcare insurance
But I could be wrong
This was last year:
But googling the subject there seems to be more lawsuits going on
If people are discouraged from visiting a doctor because of their economic situation then that's also a way of putting others first
> I see here people saying that in the US some people is afraid to get a diagnose
Wouldn't this lead to a lower detection rate
I'm not sure
Wouldn't the cause of death still be cancer
True for some countries, but where I live we both [smoke] and [drink] less than in the US
(I live in Norway)
Will you still get paid if your boss says you are too injured to do your job
Over here it would be illegal to not pay
Dutch
First it sounds norwegian, then it sounds german
Then again it sounds english
I think it’s cool though, but it screws with my brain
Whatever they speak in the netherlands, I won't say anything about finnish, (please dont stab me)
Im Norwegian and Danish is most likely made up by a mad man with a potato in his throat
Danish is basically norwegian but very drunk
Took me, a Norwegian, longer to learn counting in Danish than French
So true-
Once we were in Copenhagen (you have no idea how close i was to writing København) and my mom went down into the lobby of our hotel to ask if we had to pay separately for wifi for the PC
So she goes up to the person by the desk as says:
"Må vi betale seperat for wifi til PCen" (Do we have to pay separately for wifi for the PC
The person looked confused at her, "P... C? ?"
My mom not getting it, repeated, "Ja, PC" (Yes, PC)
This goes on for a little until my dad jumps in and proudly says "Com-piu-dah" (Computer)
And the person immediately understood and was like "åhhhh
Computa"
My mom still gets annoyed whenever this story gets brought up haha
The billion ...diacritical marks (') makes it much harder, despite also being phonetic if you pay close attention
It goes well with how Kiss is a popular surname
The Viking ages
It's an important part of my country's history
But I might not be the one to blame, the Vikings didn't exactly document a lot of things
Well at least Norway did a ton of trade, mostly with the hanseatic leage (German traders)
But we sold a shitton of dry cod to other european countrys because of all the fasting time under the catholic church (I am guessing also under the protestant church, based on the hanseatic)
I am taking a masters in archaeology, and I am going to specialize in the middle ages
But a funfact, this also lead to more equality between women and men compared to other countrys, because women were at home running the farm, while the men were out fishing
Which lead to a good amount of farms being owned by women
Note: some schools have different schedules, because they have different lines or are just different
But at my high school it goes like this:
School starts at 8:15
Each class is 1h 35min long, with 5min break in the middle
min breake between classes
45min lunch(Friday’s has only 30min)
When school ends completely depends on the person and what grade you are in
I know some people who only have one class some days, they start at 11:20, and done by 14:00
But that means they have longer days other days
At my school last class is from 14:05 to 15:40
So that is the latest you are finished
When you are in 2nd or 3rd grade of high school it is common to have free periods, meaning just an open space in you schedule
They also depends upon the person, but for me, I have 2 that both combine with lunch, meaning I have 2h 25min break 2 times a week
That is just high school
Middle school and primary schools have completely different schedules, and most schedules vary by school
Edit: Also wanted to add, there is no school buses(unless you have physical issues) to take you to school
So you rely only on public transportation
In my high school classes usually started 8:00
One lesson is 45 min, but they were usually combined into 2, 3 or even 5 lesson periods with the same subject/course
15 minute break at 9:30-9:45, lunch usually at 11:15-12:00 or 12:00-12:45, and then a last break at 13:30-13:45 before the last lesson from 13:45 to 14:30 or 15:15
I usually had one day a week where I went home by lunchtime because of the way courses were planned
(4 time slots for subjects, 5 lessons a week each, but you only had 3 courses
This way I had 5 empty lessons every week)
School starts at 08:30 and ends 13:30 from 1st-4th grade and 08:30 and ends 14:30 for 5th grade and up
The break and so on is diffrent from school to school
I have school children and their day looks like this: School starts 08:45
One lesson lasts 45 minutes, and then usually 15 min break (out and play)
Lunch 11:30, packed lunch eaten in the classroom with milk (which they get at school)
The teacher might read a book for them while they eat
Done at school at sometime between 12:30 and 14:15 depending on how old they are, and which day it is
Many children below the age of 11 will stay at school until their parents are done at work in an after school program
(Mine never did)
My lessons were 45 minutes each :D (Norway
I would get up around 07:40 and get ready for the day (eat breakfast, get dressed, pack food)
I would leave my house around 08:30 - 08:40
School would start at 09:00
We would have two classes right after each other, a 15 minute break, one more class, food break that lasted for 30 minutes
After "food-time" (lmao) we would have another set of two classes right after each other, another 15 minute break and then one last class
School would be done at 14:30 and basically everyone went home
(Some had to stay back for extracurricular things or just had to work on something longer than expected)
I loved thursdays cause on thursdays the first three classes we would have food-class and eat what we made in "food-time", double gym class after food-break and then math in the last class
I work in primary school, but with special ed kids who are not in normal classes (forsterket avdeling)
Their day starts at 8
30 am and lasts until either 1 or 2 pm
We don't have traditional breaks, so I can't speak to that
I don't think any of the normal school days at our school lasts much longer than 2
15 pm
I dont know where in Norway you live PR which «linje» you’re studying
But I have 45-50 minute long classes then a 5 minute break between each class
Then we have a 20 minute break from 09:50 to 10:10 and then a 30 minute break from 11:45 to 12:15 and school is finished 14:45
The Norwegian butter crises od 2011
We had an aweful year  of horrible weather so our life stock didnt produce as much butter as usual
So when christmas came around and ever woman above 30 was going to bake for the holiday, they didnt have butter
We had to import butter from Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Netherlands
Funniest shit was that a couple of Poles was arrested at the Swedish-Norwegian border, trying to smuggle in alot of butter to sell on the black market
Roald Amundsen had planned a voyage to be the first to reach the north pole
Before he left two other guys claimed to have reached it first
Despite having raised money for the voyage to the north pole from both the royal family and parliament
He had also lent the ship from his idol, Nansen, on the pretense that he did not use it for some sort of race, rather than the voyage was for the sake of science
Anyways Amundsen didn’t care, the north pole was old news, the south was the future, but he could not just say that and contradict all these other things he had said, and so he just lied
He lied to the royals, parliament, his idol, and the country at large, he even lied to his fucking crew, the people going with him
He only told his brother and the guy steering the ship
In the end, it was alright
He reached the south pole on the fourteenth of December 1911, a little while before the second guy, Scott would reach the pole
He returned home and has been a Norwegian folk hero since
May 17th, it's our national day and it's a holiday where everybody put on their nice bunad or dress and go out the whole day
Kids are the main focus, and parades are arranged with flags everywhere and lots of games for kids in the afternoon
The amount of soft ice, hotdogs and helium balloons sold that day probably outnumbers the rest of the year combined
Young adults often gather in groups and have champagne breakfast and enjoy a few pints in the sun while watching the parades
Of course, this was not the same last year and won't be this year due to Corona
We have have waffle day and we make waffles on that day
They're often very good
May 17, Constitution Day, without a doubt
If you've been in Norway on any other day and don't know about May 17, you'd think the entire country went completely mad
Everyone is in the streets celebrating from early morning to late evening, and everyone wears their best clothes
It's pretty much a faux pas to go outside unless you're dressed in your finest
I highly recommend visiting Norway on that day for this reason, just don't expect to easily find a place to sit down and eat
And obviously wait until Covid is gone
I would say Constitution day on 17th of May
We all dress up in our best clothes (more than half of us in national costumes), carry a flag, walk in parades, watch parades, eat lots of ice cream, the children play and take part in different things where they can win little prices, then many end the day with a barbeque in the evening
Sadly the pandemic is putting a damper on the celebration this year and last, but next year we will be back
Easy
Constitution Day - May 17th
The entire country participates in traditional celebrations from morning till midnight - a tradition that goes back till the 1830s.
The amounts of ice cream I consumed as a kid each may 17th was insane
Without a doubt the best day of the year
There's something about thousands of tipsy people walking around the city in traditional garments waving flags
Sytten mai is forever and always the best day
Springtime, food, nice clothes, marching bands and happy people
It’s originally a Swedish tradition
The 25th of march is called “Maria Bebådelsedag” (the day Mary found out she was pregnant with a certain baby) also known as “Vårfrudagen”. Vårfrudagen somehow got translated to våffeldagen (the waffle day) by the people
So the Swedes started eating waffles that day
The Norwegians got jealous and decided to adopt the waffle day in Norway as well
On the 24th, thats when we open presents
Only thing I do on the 25th is eat christmas food
There are probably alot of traditions connected to the 25th, 26th and so on
But I dont know many who celebrate this
The main celebration is on the 24th, thats when we open presenst and eat
The 23rd we eat porridge and sees who gets the almond, mostly with exdended family, and we go out and give a bowl of porride to the Fjøsnisse (a sort of spirit who lives in barns and makes sure the animals are all right, but only if you give them the porrige)
The 25th we eat breakfast with extended family
Same as in Sweden, on the 24th, celebrated with close family
The 25th is often used for a family party with some (or all) of the extended family
In my family its pretty common to eat porrige on the 23rd, and give a plate to the Fjøsnisse
That's exactly what we do in my family
We don't go to church but we visit the graves of our family and light some candles
Santa would visit when us kids were 0-6 ish years old and we'd put out a plate of porridge for him
Yeah we do the same, eat porridge with an almond in
I do eat it, not on christmas, I just eat it whenever I feel like it
People still make it from scratch, maybe not very common though, they sell them at stores as well
You can have a lot of things in it
Butter with sugar, or with sugar and cinnamon, or brown cheese
On 17th of may, where I live, there are usually multiple old women sellinge lefse
It gets a bit more difficult separating Swedes and Danes from Norwegians, but I’ll try and find a picture
[This guy] is about as stereotypical norwegian I could find
There's also [this] fake colour image of Fridtjof Nansen, but it's hard to say how true to life it is
That pinkish streak from cheek to cheek is a trait I see a lot among relatives, acquaintances and neighbours
The way English people shape their mouth when they talk makes me instantly recognize them
It's like a circle
Funny thing: when I was in Italia and took the train from Venezia to Bologna, I wound up next to a couple  that spoke I'm guessing was Catalan to each (not familiar enough to be certain, but it did sound similar to Spanish while clearly NOT being Spanish, so it was an educated guess)
The dude looked a lot like a younger version of the man from southern Catalonia, but the woman was a pale, blue-eyed, light blonde that wouldn't have stood out in Sweden
Same in Norway
Germans and Dutch tourists keep falling down steep places or get dangerously close to wildlife
I should add that I know basic Italian, so I'm certain it was not one of their dialects
Also remember that she used a phrase that sounded close to "per bajkar". Did some digging and discovered that the word might have been "baixar", which can apparently be used to mean "get off" or "alight".
Pulpit rock, Lofoten Islands or maybe Vigeland statue park in Oslo
Not sure which one is the top, but those are the most famous ones I could think of
Norway is so long that there are different types of tourists visiting
Those who want to visit cities and the urban life usually go to Oslo or Bergen
Those who want to experience the nature usually go to places like Lofoten, Prekestolen, Geirangerfjorden and a whole lot of other places that the other Norwegians here commented
One very popular spot you will almost never be able to enjoy alone during tourist season: Preikestolen
Karl Johans gate which runs from the royal palace to the central station is absolutely packed in summer and christmas
I think more people should visit Istria
I’ve been there a couple of times (mostly in Umag), and I absolutely loved it
I guess the Alps get lots of tourists too
What makes Heidelberg a big touristy place
Bryggen (the old Hanseatic wharf) in Bergen belongs on this list for sure
Filled to the brim throughout the summer months
You forgot our roads
Feel like I end up behind a German caravan driving 20 km/h below the speed limit every time I drive along a narrow road
Norwegian tourism in general has exploded the last ten years or so
More like 15-20 years ago, about the time where the 40+ learned to make decent home pages
Nah, Lofoten has been a huge tourist attraction for years and years
At least more than "a few"
Yeah, but what are some tourist attractions there
I've never heard of it outside that I know a guy from there
Yeah, I'd know which country both Minnesota and Kent is in
If you ask us to name all 50 states we probably won't be able to do that, but Imran, even Ross couldn't all though he had all of Thanksgiving
I think most people will know where the "big ones" like Texas, Florida, New York, Alaska and California are located
Even though I can't locate North and South Dakota on the map I know that they are states in the US
I couldn't tell you most of the state capitals, but I can point out most of the states on the map
Always seem to fuck up the midwest though
People should be familiar with the common ones
I personally can point them all out on a map but that's just me
Here’s my attempt at naming them all:
Texas, California, New York, New Jersey, Florida, Washington, Nevada, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio, Alaska, Hawaii, Georgia, New England maybe
, Iowa, Alabama, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, 23/50
Please correct me if I Invented a state that doesn’t exist
I can only speak for myself
I know about pretty much every state but i have almost no clue about state capitols except Tallahassee, Albany, Trenton and Sacramento
Knowing there is a state called Minnesota doesn't mean they can point it out on a map
(Like most Americans know there is a country called Hungary
But might not know exactly where it is located in Europe
>Yes, I think I could probably name them all, given enough time
I challenge you to complete this
Oh man, I thought North Dakota was east of South Dakota
Well, I'm not surprised they didn't know *where* it was
> also has its own regions
Well, Hungary is the same size as Indiana
Aaah, sorta like Sweden then
> which might actually surprise some people
You could be right
Å tisse på stolen -To pee on the chair
Å stole på tissen - To trust your penis/vulva
Norwegian - Jeg må alltid rape etter middag
English - After dinner i always have to rape (burp)
Just try Tibetan
I had a lot of trouble with German when I had it as my mandatory third language in "junior high" (it was either that or French)
The grammar is nasty and I never really "got it" on an intuitive level - that insecurity tripped me up a lot, and I never really managed to immerse myself in the language
I think that if I had a convincing reason to, I could do much better now, though
I know myself and my own mind a lot better, I've picked up some useful background info in linguistics, and I would probably have an easier time with immersion, as well
When I was in college, I was bored stiff, and decided that I actually did miss languages in general
German wasn't all that tempting, so I decided to indulge my inner weeaboo and study Japanese on my own instead
It's not what I'd call easy to learn, but immersion was a bit easier
I haven't been making any real effort for several years now, but I'm competent enough to be able to read manga and things like that, and understand quite a bit of spoken Japanese
My writing and speaking skills are terrible, because I haven't practiced those too much
I might actually be going to Japan in a while, which means I can find out exactly *how* terrible
I haven't studied a lot, but Czech and Croation were a bit tricky
Probably only dutch would be easier
In Norway you can choose between Spanish, French and German in middle school
Then in high school you can choose to continue the language of your choice or take German
German is without a doubt considered the easiest language
Norwegian is pretty similar to Swedish so, that is why I am commenting
Buffalo Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo
I've tried to learn some Greek, and the alphabet doesn't seem too hard
Tibetan or Georgian
My school only has German and Spanish
Enig
They are pretty similar if you compare it to languages that are not in the same group
It's more complicated grammatically than swedish and norwegian, but that's true for a ton of languages
Deutsch ist kein problem mein freund
And I don't speak Icelandic
No, I'm glad I live in Europe
Le sad EFTA noises
I don't
I don't and would not have it any other way honestly
No, I'm pretty content without it, and would actually like less involvement and fewer directives please
WHAT
You've never visited Norway
I don't know ask a german
Yes
Join us
he's a fool
I suppose it is
We arent in the EU tho
Me in particular
It's more in general, but there's a few
Now before christmas one thing that's bothered me is that my neighbour can legally butcher his sheep and eat them
But if I want to buy even just a leg of it to cure into a ham, we have send the animal tens of kilometers to a butcher to have it done "humanely" and "safely". As if an animal transport is that
And I'm lucky to have a slaughterhouse that close
I can't really afford it either
It's more about stuff that's affected people I know or the community though
From serious issues lile privatizing the railway, to less serious but angering rulings like banning harpoon fishing at night or while wearing oxygen tanks
And then there's the just stupid rules like how we have to give ecologically farmed fish homeopathy as a first line of medicine
I mean wtf
And thank goodness for that
Tourist season is crowded enough I guess
It was pretend surprised
They have hubs in Oslo and Copenhagen as well
Urgh if I have to hear one more person complain about ‘radiation’ from signal towers / phones / WiFi routers I’ll lose my dick
I can't really think of any in particular
Homeopathy exists but I personal don't know anyone believing in it
There are hardly any (if any at all) flat earthers, Scientologists
Anti-vaxers are a small minority
That is not to say that crazy "truths" don't exist here
One example is a small church in Sweden where one of the ladies were announced to be the "bride of Christ". The story about this cult includes sexual abuse, physical abuse, slavery, shunning, deciding which married couple were allowed to have sex, the bride of Christ getting everyone's gold and lots of money, and also murder
([More info here] )
If something that crazy can happen in Sweden it can most definitely happen here as well
A lot of people talk about “secret islamization” of the nation, which means they are very concerned that Norway will become overtaken by muslims
It’s not a conspiracy theory unique to Norway, but that’s the one of the two that comes to mind
The other one is the climate change deniers
We got this black drink in this country, sometimes it contains sweetener, sometimes sugar
People drink it often, some people probably every day, even tho it don't do anything "good" except taste good
I think it's called Pepsi or coca-cola
Tell me about it :/ I rented a apartment that was owned by a old jehovas vitne lady
She was "allergic" to wifi, but lived in the city and had a cellphone with wifi and instagram
I was 22 and she would turn the wifi off if as she pleased if I "made to mutch noice". I told her she should be thankful that she had an young person who newer has a party or play loud music, we are difficult to find
Then I got myself a wireless wifi and she trew me out since I had wifi
And I refused to act as her personal carer
But I wanted to move from there anyway
She just wanted a no wifi hermit that PAIED to live there and take care of her
People believe this here
I've never heard of any of that
Of course 2020 will be a shitty year, cuz: ww3, Australia on fire, coronavirus and all other conflicts in the world
Jesus Christ some people are just assholes and hide behind religious as some excuse
My ex GF was also supposedly allergic to radiation
She made me put the WiFi in the back of the flat as far away from her as possible, so the signal was shit
I bought a cheap spare router and left it turned off in the back then hid a new one in a shoe box in the living room
Signal was great and she couldn’t tell the difference
I remember seeing something on NRK about a new antenna causing a (tiny) riot in one of our numerous counties years back
That was about it
I met one anti-vax feminist on a party once, and had a blast trying to figure out how her world worked
She got all kinds of pissed, but stuck through my torment
I don't know
I've only seen a documentary (in Swedish) myself
> Despite what you read on reddit, those people are usually otherwise completely fine
That's what people say in this thread too though
Otherwise sane people can in one turn go full bullshit mode
So true
Oh yes, im shure she avoided the wifi that way
Its not like every other house has wifi, the tv, pc or cellphone has wifi
Great idea
Its wierd though, the people who think you can be allergic to wifi
And try to force everyone else to live by their no wifi rules
That is hysterical
Good luck forcing that bill trough
What a wierdo
isn't that what a lot of politicians do
This sounds like a movie plot :/
I can't even imagine how scary it would be to come back from a war with nothing just to find out that you are completely alone in a destroyed country
Like, where do you start
How do you get food and water
I mean, this story is something not even Spielberg could've written
In norway we have two wikipedias, bokmål and nynorsk
I use them before the English version if i can
English is preferable, however I always check in Swedish or Danish as well if the Norwegian or English wiki doesn't have as much info as I'm looking for
Same
I usually end up with bokmål though
Sometimes I switch to danish/swedish if the Norwegian one doesn't have alot, and then I might look it up in English lol
Yes
Why would you spend money on water when you've got better water in your tap
Yes, not drinking tap water is unheard of
The only reason to buy bottled water is if you’re in need of a bottle
If you already have something to drink out of, it’s normal to just fill it up with tap water (from anywhere, including places like public restrooms in gas stations)
Fun fact: The “exclusive” and expensive Voss water, which can be bought all over the world, is just Norwegian tap water
It doesn’t have a special taste for me while in Norway, but whenever I’ve been out of the country for a while, a bottle of Voss water tastes like the best, most refreshing water ever
But I guess I’m biased ;)
Not drinking it is unormal here, very few people actually buy water, recently in the municiplaty where I live the water got poisoned so that was one expection, but we just boiled our water
It’s probably better than Voss as well
Huh, I didn’t know that
Interesting
I’ve never tried Voss water in the US, but I wonder if I’d notice the difference
Toll’s, they are everywhere and is so expensive
And the roads are preatty bad to, holes and bumps everywhere makes it hard to drive
Is this because someone in the government or the local authorities is a friend with someone who runs a pole production company
I think someone here on Reddit wrote about it a while ago
My guess is that all those children have food to eat, a roof over their head, and they all have access to education and health care
They just can't go on holiday abroad, or get expensive shoes, and they ride a second hand bike
Poverty in Europe usually looks very different to the rest of the world (the exception might be some gypsy communities in southern Europe)
> "wild parking"
Do people respond with "wild keying"?
I wish this was how the discussion would be framed more often
I'm so sick of hearing racists blame it all on the immigrants, their religion, culture or whatever instead of realizing that many of them are basically made to live in poorer neighborhoods relative to the rest of the population and don't get a fair chance at integration
It's mostly alcohol-related, isn't it
i did that lol
the fact that our roads so consistently are complete garbage continues to baffle me
Immigrants of europe, what expectations did you have before moving there, and what turned out not to be true
I was born here in Europe so I can't answer this, but I just had to mention this
We've had like a few hours of snow this year in Oslo
Constant 4 to 7 degrees
This isn't how winter is supposed to be
Duisburg for me, but tbf I only know the likes of Malaga and Poznan because I have heard of football teams from there
Poland, Romania and Bulgaria are considered Eastern Europe if you lived before the Soviet Union and the Iron curtain fell
And they certainly are if you say Eastern Europe because of history and culture
The only reason why it geographically is not quite right is because of Russia
And culturally it is stranger that Russia is considered European than Poland, Romania and Bulgaria are considered parts of Eastern Europe
Oh, so you say you like football
Name all the host cities of the European championship then
Most definitions have Switzerland as a central European country too though
It's always been more about history and politics than pure geography
osen just means "the bag" in Norwegian
Not that menacing
Don’t, its useless
Even if you learn the language you won’t understand what people from most parts of Norway say, we have so many dialects that we can’t even count them
so you’ll probably do well in Oslo you won’t understand most words in Trondheim or Stavanger
I’m not gonna argue that its not beautiful or anything, but its useless
5 million people speak it, 15 more can understand you
Its better to learn Spanish, Russian, German and Italian
Only reason to learn it would be if you moved here, or
if you are obsessed with Norway or smt
Not Scandinavians
Technically there isn’t an official language in the US
English is the most spoken language, but they haven’t actually made it the official language of the country
To be fair, he said healthier and not healthy
Same in Norway, but our languages are pretty much the same so
I definitely agree with you
Much of European institutional traditions making up huge and important aspects of society undoubtedly primarily stem from ancient Rome and Greece
True, they were, so I don't want to say we are similar, but many of our shared institutions have their foundations in those civilizations, so it is a shared trait in most of Europe
Something more obvious to have in common is the influence of the renaissance, which in turn was inspired by the civilizations of antiquity
Norway:
I usually got seasick when on a boat and after being sick she (or anyone) would ask "Have you fed the crabs
If going for a walk mum might say: out for a walk, never mad(ut på tur, aldri sur)
If it was raining she would say: There is no such thing as bad weather only the wrong clothing(Det fins ikke dårlig vær bare dårlig klær)
This I think was quite common for anyone my age and up who wasn't finishing their food: Eat your food, think about the starving children in Africa
Or if I tried to have a lie in: get up you can't sleep away your whole day
If you stand in front of the TV: Are you the son of a glassmaster
French moms are shitty, man
What's the issue with yawning
Letting the heat in Norway is "We don't heat for the crows"
To that we say "did you bring a dog
"This looks like a pigsty" - mom
"This looks like a bombed whorewhouse" -dad
In Norway, the licorice candy «Skipper’s Pipes» were banned from sale in 2010 because the shape resemble a tobacco product
You could buy them in the duty free shops at airports, but they could only be on display in the tobacco room in the back
And could only be sold to people over 18
As of 2017 the ban was lifted, but it is still illegal to advertise this product
Obviously, the ban made this particular candy more popular than ever
Well it's illegal to "die" in Svalbard due to the permafrost, It's not really illegal but Your body can't be buried there, the body have to be shipped to the mainland (i don't know if this is exactly true so if you know tell me
Edit: there were some typos
Norway here
There are some weird laws on Svalbard, but all are understandable and enforced
1) You are not allowed to die on Svalbard
(Nobody will bury you, because of the permafrost, and older people or seriously sick people are transported away from Svalbard because of this)
2) You are not allowed to have a cat on Svalbard
(They are considered a serious threat against the ecosystem)
3) You are not allowed to go to an uninhabitated area without a rifle
(Polar bears are not very friendly animals)
It's illegal to use a lawn mover on Sundays and public holidays
This to give neighbours some peace and relaxation on these days
Police may enforce this law by giving warnings and fines
That is a strange one
A pub without a dance permission must also stop their guests if they make «spontaneous dance-like moves», as it is classified as dancing
LOVE the noise laws
Norway has had the same arrangement for ages on radios and TVs, a “Broadcasting license” to be paid twice a year for every household which has a TV
Since it’s very old fashioned compared to today’s media habits it’s to be adopted into a new tax to be paid per person, nevertheless how little states TV you watch or radio you listen, even own a TV or not
Well that's cool, i heard about it on youtube and nrk (idk why but i have a wierd obsession with searching up things about my own country and russia)
As long as you're not enjoying it
Is y not a vocal
Oh my god I'm so jealous
We have two written languages and neither are phonetically written
It's dumb because the whole point of latin script is to have phonetic representation
Then we imported it to a bunch of other languages with different sounds and didn't bother to change much of anything first
It's easier than danish though, which is something
Even if you're trying to speak "normert bokmål" or something like that you'll still do deg ->  "dei", jeg -> "jei", etc
It does work well enough in Nynorsk, on the condition that you know a fair bit about sound changes in the person's dialect and spelling since Old Norse
Most don't though, so it isn't that applicable
*"Yes* /2hɑːɽ/ *is spelled "herda" because it's from Old Norse herða and your dialect as an* /e/ > /ɑ/ *change before <rð>, which becomes /ɽ/, and the ending drops because of the double consonant"*
Written Norwegian is complicated
I am no expert, and this is just how I understand it
Our written languages is based on Danish, updated a few times, some pronunciations have drastically changed and never been updated, I think many of us used to have more consonants, a more "hard" language
Some G's hare hard, some are combined like "gj" to make just a "j" sound, and some are just straight up "j". I also think the written language has changed many dialects, dialects used to be frowned upon
Many of us with dialects writes phonetically among friends and people we have a casual relationship with
I like to base it on the structure of nynorsk, otherwise it would be wild
It's a mess
Nynorsk is almost only used in the west of Norway
Even thought it’s taught in school, most of Norway never have any proper exposure to it except for those in the west
I can also say with confidence that even people here struggle with not knowing the spelling and sometimes (extremely many times) whole words as well
Many words are completely unknown to most people
Do you hear Norse often
Or did you mean Norwegian
Theres a lot of silent letters, mostly at the beginning of words
Often a "h" in front of "v" if its the first letter like in "hvor" or "hvem" (where, who)
Well that one's easy, just say "samf"!
One based on the Danish we had used in the union for a long time already, the other created in the 1800s based on certain dialects
The former is used by about 90%, the latter by ~10%.
Non-native who's studied English at a university level
The problem is that latin script is invented to represent the sounds of the latin language
English has different sounds, but decided to just use the same alphabet without changing anything to accomodate for this
So whenever you're learning a foreign language and you think "hey why do they have all these extra letters like Ø?"
The answer is because of having some goddamn sense
**The most common vowel in the entire English language does not have it's own letter
** You can only imagine how frustrating this is to learn
The sound represented by *a* in *about* is the same one that is represented by *i* in *pencil* or  *u* in *supply*. Hell, sometimes it's not even represented by anything, as in whatever's supposed to be between *th* and *m* in *rhythm*.
That’s what I thought
Norse is just as much a precursor language for Danish and Swedish as it is for Norwegian
They both use three, but in Bokmål you can drop the female gender if you want and use the common gender (ie the male one)
The only place where they exclusively speak with only two genders is Bergen (they have a very distinct dialect influenced by the fact that the city was part of the Hanseatic League back in the day)
If you use the common gender more, you're using what is called Riksmål, a more conservative branch of Bokmål. It's very rare to see written material without the female gender at all though, or at least female conjugations in certain words
Standard American English
Pronunciation guide below by google
Make sure you select American from the drop-down menu
Google didn't have "supply", but I found a youtube video
[About]
[Rhythm]
[Pencil]
[Supply]
If you're having trouble maybe you're stressing the vowel since you're looking for it
The schwa sound is almost always unstressed in English
Sorry, I know that it's April Fool's day, but I don't get this joke
Please explain
EDIT: Ok I googled it
Apparently in some English speaking countries, elementary school children are taught that A', 'E', 'I', 'O' and 'U' are the only vowels
This is incredibly wrong, as like I tried to say in my original comment - a vowel is a term of phonetics, not of writing
It's a convenient lie teachers tell children to help them learn how to write, but it is not something you should believe as an adult
Rhythm actually has two vowels
/ˈrɪð(ə)m/
ɪ and ə are vowels
You mean how it's pronounced
Like the "u" in "fur" or the "e" in "service", as spoken by a generic American
I edited my comment  probably the same time you wrote this
I googled it

It's a convenient lie teachers tell children to help them learn how to write, but it is not something you should believe as an adult
Rhythm actually has two vowels
You can see it written in IPA (not the beverage, the [international phonetic alphabet] You see it in dictionaries next to words to indicate the pronunciation) like so:  /ˈrɪð(ə)m/
ɪ and ə are vowels
ə is called [schwa] and is the most common vowel in the English language
EDIT: Speaking of things you teach children that is wrong, this old rule: "i before e, except after c". This is true for common words like believe, receive and deceive
This is useful for children to learn because at an elementary school level, this holds true for most words they will write
However there are so many exceptions to this "rule" that it's absurd to consider it a rule at all
I before E? What about *seize, caffeine, leisure, weird, rottweiler, either, neither, atheist, vein*?
Or even if there's a C, what about *species, policies, science*?
Is it the same in Estonian
> I think English would look very different if schwa had a letter assigned to it lol
I think English wəd look very difərənt if schwa had ə lettər əsigned tə it lol
Ok so "would" and "to" really depends on the dialect here but you get what I mean
In Norway we have different (written) vowels and in elementary school in Norway we learned it like this:
*A vowel is a sound you can hold indefinetly
* Like you can say AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA but you cant say  KKKKKKKKKKKK
It's not correct either but I feel like it's closer
"På ramma" - "On the frame", as in sitting on the edge/frame
A colleague of mine refers to it as having a framework agreement (jeg har en rammeavtale)
We sometimes call it the office, and say we're going there to do some paperwork
"Doing some paperwork"
My name is usually sufficient
It has all the hard stuff to pronounce from Norwegian
"Ibsens ripsbusker og andre buskevekster"
"(Henrik) Ibsens currant bushes and other bushes"
Is a common tounge-twister in Norway, I don't know if its particulary hard to pronounce for foreigners but saying it fast is almost impossible (for me)
Other than that I've heard from some americans that the ø can be hard to get right
Works like a free visa
It's time to link the youtube video again
The colloquial word for friend is "kompis", and we can address each other that way too
Not quite sure what it means - compadre maybe
Our crew is called "gutta" (the boys), if they're boys at least
I do know of one set of girls that call themselves "gutta" too
Jentene, guttene, gjengen (the girls, the boys, the "gang")
But mostly we use their first names
Kis - "Dude", exists in different dialect variations
But is kinda used more in the Trøndelag area afaik
I guess one could use "kompis" ("(male) friend") or "gutta" ("guys"), but you're right that the most common is just to use people's names
Does
tøser mean the same as in Norwegian
And by that I mean sluts
Same for Norway
I say bro/bror all the time to my friends
Tøs actually means "girl" in Norwegian as well, at least in Bergen
The local water park even named the girls' locker room "Småtøser". Most young people use the word in the slutty sense, though
Wallah broshan
Definitely doesn’t just mean girl here in Oslo
That’s probably the reason
It’s funny because I’ve never thought about tøs meaning just girl, but right after my last comment today I went to a local cafe where most of the servers are a bit older and I noticed they had “Te fra tøsene” on the menu
Weren't the Rus a Swedish people or something irl
Maybe that's where the story came from
I mean the [Kievan Rus] (I looked it up)
Apparently there's some disagreement on whether the name is Norse, Finnish, or Slavic, but some tribes from present-day Sweden seem to have been involved at least
I think that NASA built a satellite in the 90’s with two groups of engineers that used different systems
One group used the metric system and the other group used the imperial system
The result was that the satellite disappeared in space or something like that
There was a time where we had to go through border control to visit a lot of European countries
(I once spent 5 hours on the border between Germany and Poland
Which was fun
) But we could always freely travel between Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland
So it's odd to me that Canada and the US, which are sharing a border, have similar economy, and similar culture don't have a more open border
Do you know why that is
Good luck with the move
I think you will like the Netherlands
In Norway we have terminated the ancestor thing if you want I live here you would have a work visa on a job that requires a bachelor or higher or be a refugee
More people speak English in Norway than in Canada (89% vs 86%)
Skateboarding was illegal until 1989
The use of salmon in Sushi was introduced/suggested to Japan in the early 80s by us in order to export more of it
Norway is the only place you can still get the popular soda Urge
The first science fiction novel was written in 1741 by the Norwegian author Ludvig Holmberg
"Nils Klims underjordiske rejse" is a novel that actually challange gender roles, and other stuff as well
Obviusly it was made illegal though
That is like the equivalent of asking someone if they need help with the dishes just as they are finishing the last plate
Do you speak Manx by any chance
I visited Murmansk in the 90's. And people with HUGE fur coats were standing outside selling ice cream
Others were selling sunflower seeds (..or was that in Poland
If its any comfort, I have no idea what any of the colours in our flag means
Your nation is the birthplace of two of the world's best cyclists right now, Primoz Roglic and Tadej Pogacar
Of course we know about Slovenia :)
Edit; Peter Sagan is Slovak, and I'm an idiot
Choo choo
Your expectations are correct, we do not know how to wash dishes manually
That's why we never offer to do them until after they've been done (by swedes)
Ah, I see
First launched in Norway under the name Urge as a "test product", it quickly proved successful and popular, and it was expanded to other European countries
The success in Norway and Europe convinced Coca-Cola to launch in the U.S as well, under the name Surge
It sold well during the first few years, but numbers fell, and the product was pulled
As of now, Norway is the only country where you can buy this nectar of the gods
I wouldnt say it is similar to fanta
I dont quite remember the taste
I will buy one and return later
I’ve visited Kiruna overnight on holiday road trips, it’s interesting to see those mined up hills like giant stairways, and it’s generally a very quiet and slightly depressing place
Is really all that is considered a part of area of the city, a part of the city
Because I would not call a place that sparsely populated a city, that is if it is evenly distributed, which it obviously is not
> There was a similar plan for Norway
And NOW you tell us
Kiwi-Tinaa ️️️ alt skal grillast ️️
Wow TIL, I didn't know this
>I haven't seen supermarkets of the same kind as Kiwi or Joker around here (they feel more like big convenience stores or kiosks)
Kiwi and Joker is the same company as Meny - all are owned and run by *Norgesgruppen*. They are just differently labelled
Meny is bigger, Kiwi is smallish, and Joker is very small
We don't use the Euro in Norway, but we've phased out all coins that are smaller than 1 kr
The last one was phased out in 2012
Even the 1 kr coin is pretty useless, so maybe we'll get rid of that one too eventually
It's not as if he's on the 5 dollar bill or anything, lol
Nope, things will say "24,99" or whatever and they just round to the nearest round number
So 24,99 will be 25 kr
Here it's mixed groups according to age, outdoorsy and fun, but not very strict
We are Scandinavians after all
We also have sea-scouts here, where they spend a lot of their time out in boats, or in kajakk / canoe
And although they do learn a lot about safety at sea and so on, its mostly just for fun
They do exist in Spain
[Source]
But maybe just less widespread there
Very common in northern Europe
It's probably a bit down to culture
And I would also think the southern Europe heat would kind of put a damper on vigorous forest hiking
You're welcome
[Bli hos Meg (Stay with me) - Dina]
A song every single Norwegian 90s kid has had stuck in their brain since 2003
Complete with the era defining trance synth
This was the song you put on at the school disco just after awkwardly slowdancing to When you Say Nothing at All by Ronan Keating, and then finally could make use of the overload of sugar in your blood from drinking too much Fanta Exotic
I can feel my hair building up with cheap sticky hairgel again and turning spiky just as I'm listening to it now
This song is made for one group as part of the Russ celebrations we do at the end high school here in Norway
I normally despise this music (because of the lyrics and lazy songwriting), but this one we listened to a lot during my Russ celebrations and I kind of love it
The lyrics on this isn't that much better than the other songs, but at least it's not about getting girls super drunk in order to sleep with them
Like most of the others are
I remember this being popular in Norway when I was like 9 and it annoyed me as I couldn’t understand why he was talking about a boat he knows  (I associated talking boats with shit my annoying cousins was into)
This comment reminded me of [this] other *russ* song that was pretty controversial, with lyrics such as «er du 13 er du med» which means «if youre 13 youre coming with». the songs are about sex, alcohol and drugs
(Age of consent is 16 and alcohol is 18+ in Norway, russ are often 17-19)
This wildly different from the song I posted haha
I guess you Swedish have a more sensible way of celebrating than we have
Yeah most of them are pretty terrible if you ask me
Champagnegalopp looks more like the Russ celebrations we have
Though ours goes on for a month or so right before exams
Chances are I wouldn't enjoy your celebrations more than our haha
I would say "swedes are doodoo-heads", but we have a lot of swedes here too
Taco is to be eaten on Friday and we secretly crave hearing foreigners saying positive things about our country
Sweden sucks and Denmark like potatoes so much they stick'em down their throats
Derry Girls is fantastic
I really hope they continue making it
I agree, however the best teacher i ever had was a swede
Started watching “Twelve” on Netflix but it’s in Flemish
How similar are Dutch and Flemish language
Had to ask
As an outsider, I very much prefer potato or beef
Also, tacos are to be eaten in a lefse, not a hard shell, as per the rules of r/deterfredag
Ugh this is so true and it makes me a little uncomfortable
Sorry guys
Ok that's borderline something
Oh god reading this makes me cringe, but i know there are plenty of norwegians like that
Sorry on their behalf
I mean, Norway's cool but we're not THAT cool
And Scottish whisky is the best wth
Taco is a social meal thus perfect for Friday's
Alrighty
Thanks
No, but when I lived aboard for a year with a Norwegian friend, we sometimes realised we spoke English to each other when no one else was around
I've never had a problem with it, and hadn't really heard of it before Reddit
I pick up most of my packages at the post office/the grocery store
If theye small enough they're left in the mail box
I usually pick pacages up in the local store
Thieves arent a problem where I live anyways, so they could probably just leave it outside the door
Here in Norway it's more common that if the package you've ordered doesn't fit the mailbox and you're not home to pick it up at your door, it's left at a post office corner of your nearest store or gas station that has one
Sometimes there is a toll you have to pay for the package, if so, then the mailman can come to your door for you to sign and pay, if you aren't home, they're just going to deliver it to the store for you to pick up later
No, because packages aren't left unattended on porches
Why would that even be a thing
If I am not at home the delivery van will either try again the next day, or (more often) - deliver it at the nearest "post in shop". Or the package will be delivered directly there
So no package is ever left outside my door
(Post in shop is post office services located in a local food shop)
It's been a problem where I live and people are encouraged to have their packages sent to the local "post in shop". There have been a few incidents of thieves being caught red handed, where one of them had a cache of stolen items in his apartment
They just deliver them to the local post office (which for years have been in a grocery store), or on the seldom occasion I get something from DHL they call me and ask, I've gotten them to deliver it to my workplace instead since it was enroute
They would never leave it at the porch unless I said it was ok
Heard on the news some guy was arrested for having stolen packages from people's letterboxes in nov/Dec here in Norway, but I can't remember what city that was in
It don't think it happens that much though- I've lived in a few countries, and Norway is definitely the country I feel has the least crime petty or otherwise
> No, because no porch pirate would be able to wait long enough that Postnord delivered the package
That made me laugh so much
And I'm even happy with Postnord
Or maybe I have just adjusted my expectation as to how long it should take them to deliver
A friend of mine had a neighbor that kept stealing her packages out from the mailbox, so she had to order to the grocery store which was about half an hour away by car
> parcel machines
Tell us more
I disagree, I've had much better experience with Posten than Postnord
When that happens its time to put a lock on your postbox
Where do you live
We are starting to get these in Oslo
I've seen several similar machines
Postnord has many, and Posten/Bring have a few
Yes I definitely prefer Posten
Additionally, for many people it’s often easier to get packages from Posten, because Postnord pickup places can be further away
We are far behind you
Here we still use people for that
Looks nice
Especially singe you can pick it up outside opening hours
No, we are not that technically advanced
Here we still use people to deliver packages
> We are starting to get these in Oslo
Then I guess they will spread down here as well eventually
(I live on the countryside in the south)
I find Oslo less interesting than most capitals in Europe, but I wouldn't call it soulless though
It definitely has a soul
Halle in Germany
Was stuck there for two hours and it felt like they had just kept all the negatives from the cold war and no bright spots
I agree 100%. It has its moments Oslo, but compared to other big European cities/capitals it's depressingly gray
But I love little towns in East Germany
(Honestly I do
Favorite: Geithain
I have friends there
Kjede VS Skjede
Chain VS Vagina
Incredibly small pronunciation difference too, with mostly younger generations getting it wrong
The ability to distinguish clearly between our kj/ky/skj/sj sounds is deteriorating and we often use less “proper” words for vagina anyways, so they don’t even realise
[A letter of marque]
I dont really get many of those, but i have had someone try and speak sweedish with me, because they thought that danish is a lot like norwegian
They knew some danish thought it was sweedish and said that to a norwegian
Jeg hadde en kid som kom opp til meg og sa «så fint skjede du har»... jeg er en gutt og jeg hadde på meg en buff
Hva mener du med det
Isn't the pope basically the father of the church though
Well, without it, you'd be considered a pirate
Brukte normen det så mye da
It costs about 50 euro a semester at my university
But, most people take student loans to help pay for housing etc
We can apply for a student loan through a student bank
If you pass all your exams, and finish your bachelors/masters, then 40% of the loan will be turned into a stipend
So yes, we do get some money, but 60% of it is a loan, and it's only converted when you pass/finish your degree
I used to get a little over €10,000 each school year, from August to June (with monthly pay)
40% of that turned into a stipend and I had to pay back 60%.
I haven't calculated it very closely
We get just over 8000kr september-December and February-June, and about 20 000kr in August and January
You have to pay it off no matter what, but the student loan is the absolute best loan you can get here, so the fees are pretty small
You have to start paying it back the month or so after you're done with the degree
You can ask to start later but I'm not sure on what basis
Of course not, it's for Norwegian citizens
Others can get loans from their own countries
Really fancy wine
As the state monopoly controls sales, cheap alcohol is expensive, but it evens out for the really expensive ones
They aren't allowed to mark up the price a lot unlike most sellers
There have been many cases when they get in some rare wine and people sleep outside the store for days to get their hands on the few bottles
Romanée-Conti (2015) seems to have gone for 50k NOK here, but 200k as the cheapest option online
Diapers, appearantly
Many Russians (used to
) come here to hoard them
Ehm
Not much
I guess electricity prices are not too bad considering our level of income
And I remember some years ago when Russians kept coming over the border to buy diapers because the shops here were fighting over customers so the prices were ridiculously low
But in general - prices here are ok for people with an average salary or more
Also most Norwegians can afford to travel to other countries, due to lower prices almost everywhere else
Good healthcare
Fjords and shitty weather
same same
[Also, diapers]
Consumer electronics at least used to be a bit cheaper or as cheap before
I feel you
I've never been to Switzerland, unfortunately, but all other countries are cheaper . Maybe except for Iceland
I like the sound of thunder
Yes, but i don't want the lightning strikes to close
I remember when i was around 8 years old during a thunderstorm
I was looking out the window and suddently there was this huge flash and a big boom right after
I was home alone and it scared the fuck outta me
It shook the whole house and the house became dark
This was during the night and i couldn't find the candles
I was a mess lol
I do like thunder, and Tor is the first half of my first name
Happy cake day
Username checks out
One that immediately came to mind because my mother says it all the time is:
vegetable = Grønnsak (Green case (as in police case or court case))
We also call lightbulbs "pære" as in "pear" the fruit
Another famous thing my mother directly translates is the saying "høy på pæra" (high on the pear) which means to be arrogant
Languages don’t always make sense
Some of my favorites:
Hviterussland - White Russia - in English Belarus
Sommerfugl - Summer Bird - In English Butterfly
Marihøne - Mari Hen - in English Ladybug
Dovendyr - Tired Animal - Sloth
Morskake - Mother’s cake - placenta
Frankrike - Frank’s kingdom- in English France
Prærieulv - Dessert wolf - Coyote
Lastebil - Loading car - Trailer/Truck
Gravemaskin - Digging machine - Excavator
And many many more
Ooo yes
The butt troll
We have almost all of them
Racoon is washer bear in Norwegian too (but not the little part)
Goodbye in the bathroom you old choclate
Sak also means thing
= green thing
Light pear or glowing pear would be proper translation as pære is just shortened version of lyspære
Here’s one
Hageslange - garden snake - garden hose
What is the “correct” name
I am guessing that is in Belarusian maybe
Norwegian checking in
Well in that case, maybe it’s not as funny as I thought of it
Thank you for learning me something new
Hei, jeg heter John
Hyggelig å treffe deg
Hvor kommer du fra
Hi, I named John
Nice to meet/hit you
Where come you from
Hard to directly translate "heter" since English would use "I am named".
>Hi, my name is John, it's a pleasure to meet you
Where are you from
Hei, mitt navn er John, det er en hyggelighet å møte deg
Hvor er du fra
Very understandable
Only thing I would change is I would say "hyggelig å møte deg"
Hei
Eg heiter John
Hyggeleg å møte deg
Kor kjem du ifrå?
I am named John
Pleasant to meet you
Where come you from
Hi, my name is John, it's a pleasure to meet you
Where are you from
Norwegian: Hei, jeg heter John, det er en glede å møte deg
Hvor er du fra
Direct translation: Hi, I called John, it is a joy to meet you
Where are you from
Pleasure should be translsted to glede and not hyggelighet
That makes the sentence sound much better
Definitely, or just "Hei, jeg er X"
Polar bears
They're the largest species of bear, they're apex predators, they can often go hungry and they will hunt people for food
Fortunately, there aren't too many polar bear attacks here, mostly because Svalbard is the only place where they're found here, but there are news of attacks (often fatal) every few years
The polar bear
Although only present in Svalbard, the polar bear is responsible for several deaths the last decades
Statistically-speaking, far more dies from encounters with dogs or from horseback riding, but a polar bear is probably the predator you're least likely to survive a chance encounter with
- They're hypercarnovorious, meaning they'll only eat meat
-They are apex predators, which means that they have little instinctive fear
-They are curios and intelligent creatures
- They're the only known predator that is known to actively hunt humans
- They're the largest land predator in the world, weighing in on average 500-800 kg with specimens as large as 1000 kg recorded
- Their attack mode gives little chance of survival
They are prone to bite over your head and throw you around, snapping your neck
-They're incredible fast
-They are living in a very harsh climate, meaning they're almost always hungry
No other bear comes close in the level of dangerousness
On Svalbard it is definitely Polar Bears
On the mainland: People can die if they crash into a moose (elk) with their car
I think bacon kills even more people
And, of course, people
In Sweden it's Surströmming
Oh shit, I was thinking bears or elks, and totally forgot we have polar bears
Yeah, they are by far the most dangerous animal we have
The siberian tiger is present only in the Asian parts of Russia, isn't it
So technically it is not a European predator
But there are polar bear populations on part of European Russia, such as Novaya Zemjla and Franz Josef Island, I think
Lynx aren't dangerous, they are way too shy
Wolves might be dangerous, but they are primarily scavengers and only occasionally hunt
The only known fatality from wolves here in Norway dates from 28th of December 1800
A six year old girl was killed by wolves
For the last 220 years no other attacks are known
I think it's only kind of true
You're not required to own a gun, and if you're going outside of Longyearbyen, you're required to have means of scaring away a polar bear, such as a flare gun, and you are recommended to have a gun, but it's not required
Yes you do
Only in the Svalbard archipelago
So unless you go there you won't encounter them
Up there it's a serious threat though, in settlements you'll generally be fine but outside of the villages you are required to carry a firearm
Some resident up there was killed this year while sleeping in a tent I believe
Hmm do you have any sources for that
All the sources I find say that polar bears are the largest species of bear
>Plus, you got Rakfisk, which is essentially the same as surströmming
We don't keep it in tins, unfortunately, so it stinks up the whole house
I remember being nauseous all day when my parents were having friends over for rakfisk when I was younger
The wolf is a stray animal, and the population roams freely between Russia, Finland, Sweden and Norway
Between 1845 and 1971 the wolf was actively hunted in Norway, but never really gone since animals strayed from Eastern Scandinavia
But predators that's actively hunted tends to get more shy of people  than predators that's protected - something we see with polar bears on Svalbard these days
The actual number of wolves in the country the last 220 years or so is difficult to estimate, but there's always been a presence
Today the wolf is protected and there are designated parts of the country where it's allowed to roam, but in my opinion the species should be allowed in a far greater area and the current population should be expanded to a far bigger number
That would not only conserve nature, but create better conditions for other animal populations as well
According to the  official numbers there were 56 individuals last year
Total for the Scandinavian peninsula is approximately 450 individuals
There are far more in Finland, the Baltic countries and Russia
The official policy is that each year 4-6 litters should be born, keeping the population around current levels
If a wolf stray out of the designated areas it cannot be hunted freely, but the Environmental Department may give permission to specially licenced hunters to kill it if it becomes a nuance
Most farmers will claim the wolf damages their livestock, so unfortunately such permissions are given too often in my opinion

At deep winter exercise in Northern Norway we were heli-dropped into the middle of fucking nowhere
Absolutely desolate
Our squad's belt wagon driver drove the long way alone and arrived at our camp 48 hours later
We were organized in such a way that our portable crapper was placed in the trailer of the BV 206
One of my squad was in a hurry to be relieved, so he threw up the door, placed his HecklerKoch AG3 *outside* the door, went in and closed the door
Someone must've been watching him, because after a few minutes, the door was opened, he heard a rifle being loaded, then looked down the barrel of his AG3
Then a soldier with thick German dialect said: Next time, I shoot you with your own gun
Platoon 3, especially Bravo squad, I fucking miss you morons
Best guys ever
TIL: The people with the most fun in the army: Germans
I remember my uncle told this story from his conscription in the 80’s. He was a tank operator
One time during winter they were doing a joint operation with some regular soldiers
A bunch of heating tents and such were set up because it was fucking freezing out, and during some quiet period during the excerise, apparently some higher command dudes from both branches were stood outside a heating tent discussing some stuff
A friend of my uncle was an adjutant to their commanding officer and he mentioned that they, very fittingly, were on the topic of how lucky the tank operators were in this excercise because it must be nice and toasty in there
Except it wasn’t nice and toasty, it was fucking scaldingly hot for some reason i can’t quite remember
And my uncle was sat half-naked in this weaponised sauna trying not to lose his mind, when he just said «fuck it» and jumped out the hatch in nothing but his underwear and socks
The officers kinda looked over at him, they greeted each other properly, then my uncle went back inside and promptly got dressed
That's the army for you
Since 2001, I've never said "I'm freezing". When you live in a tent without heating, you're sweaty from carrying 50 kg of equipment uphill for an hour in 80cm snow and you're told to sleep on top of the sleeping bag because it's fucking red alert all night, then you kinda get a perspective on what freezing is all about
I've been cold many times since, but I save the word "freeze" for those really extreme situations
On a mission when I served we all brought our phones and one party forgot to turn it off, so we in the remaining party could see them on the Snapchat map
Not at all
But then it'd be weird, of course, seeing as we aren't a member of the EU
The sight of it would give the anti-Europeans heart attack whatever reason to fly it
Yeah, we're a part of the EEA, so we can for example move to a country in the EU and vice versa just like they can within the EU
Anti-Europeans in Norway
Norway leaving the EEA is very likely in the next 10 years
I meant anti-European, since most of the anti-EU people are also very sceptical to their own continent and some will go far to openly deny that Norway belongs to the European continent
Don't know if it's likely, but a lot of people and some political parties are either against it or open to discuss alternatives
No, it really isn't very likely
EEA support remains the majority position
I have never heard about anyone thinking Norway should not be a part of Europe
Where are you getting this from
Yeah same, never heard anyone say that
It’s the impression you get from some of the more hardcore anti-anything people, especially their relation to their own continent and everything about it
All of these are great options and are worth watching:
- *The Troll Hunter* (2010)
- *The King's Choice* (2016)
- *The 12th Man* (2017)
- *Utøya: July 22* (2018, NOT THE NETFLIX VERSION)
- *Kon-Tiki* (2012)
Edit: Might as well add the *Dead Snow*-movies if you like nazi-zombies and bad humor/horror
Flåklypa grand prix from Norway
Surprisingly accurate description
I would add "Oslo, 31
August"
Too much recent-ism, I'd say
Some classics worth watching:
Ni liv (1957)
De dødes tjern (1958)
Jakten (1959)
Semi-new:
Insomnia (1997, avoid Hollywood remake)
Reprise (2006)
I would like to add In Order Of Disappearance (Kraftidioten), my favorite Norwegian film of all time
Its not very well known, but I wish it was
Its like a Norwegian Tarantino film
I hadn't heard about this before and just looked it up
Very curious, very smart political campaigning
It kind of "Americanifies" the whole event and makes the terrorist seem like a more charismatic movie villain than the loner psychopath he truly is, as opposed to the norwegian one which does not show him at all, only the youth
Imagine if a youtuber made a movie about your country's most sensitive topic
The Netflix-version might be entertaining, but it portraits the event in a completely different way
As someone else mentioned, the "bad guy" seems like an ordinary movie villain
The one I mentioned is made in a strong and cinematically beautiful way and you can really feel how horrible it was
The *entire film is a one-take* that is exactly as long as the event (72 min) and was filmed with some really good, young actors
You never really see the psychopathic murderer and he is therefore a lot more mysterious and creepy
Wikipedia describes it this way:
"The purpose of Utøya: July 22 is to promote understanding of the victims by showing the massacre from their perspective
The film was created in close dialogue with over 40 survivors, to get the action as close to reality as possible
[2] It was shot to resemble a single take in real time,[3] and follows the character Kaja from the third-person perspective before and throughout the 72-minute attack
[4] The terrorist is only a figure in the periphery throughout the film, and is only briefly seen two times
" [Source]
TL;DR: If you want to see an ordinary movie made for entertainment, watch the Netflix-version
If you want to see a strong film made to move you, watch "Utøya: July 22"
Agree, but most people want to watch relatively new movies due to the better looking filming
I agree that it is not an exciting movie :p
Neither, but the film is made more as an entertainment-movie than it is to tell the story in a deep and meaningful way
Not entirely sure, but Google Play Movies / YouTube has it here in Norway
Raiding is so 10th century
A shaman from the Russian far east was walking all the way to Moscow to exorcise Putin, and he got a group of followers, so naturally he was compared to Forrest Gump, [and was recently kidnapped by the government]
We should pick up where he left off, after all, they may stop one, but they can't stop us all can they
Britain
Lindisfarne
We did that already
In Soviet Russia demon exorcise you
You want to plant a garden
But damn those monks had a lot of gold
That's in Asia though
Screw everyone saying merkel, give my the British queen that can’t die
She will generate lots of income in the form of tourism if she brings everything she has with her
She also can’t die so she will be like an oracle eventually
She has cute corgis
Sanna Marin, but I'd take pretty much any social democrat/leftist over our current PM
Maybe not the current party in charge though
They haven't really been all that great
We thank you for you sacrifice
Hopefully Trump will be gone by next year though
Erna is really good as PM
I don't support her party, but I support her
A very noble and creative strategy
I like your thinking here
And also, Erna Solberg isn't really that great in my opinion
She is a conservative after all
Why do you like her if not her party
She represents the party, and her interests and ideology aligns with that of the party after all
Otherwise she wouldn't be in the party
It is possible to like someone and think they do a good job even if I don't agree with everything they stand for
I respect her as a politician and a leader
I think that she is a good diplomat that unites the different parties in the coalition in a good way
I would rather have another party in charge, but as it is now, I think she is doing a good job
God, what a stupid take, and what is a major problem in politics
You can respect and like a politician even though you do not necessarily agree with everything they do
Even most social democrats currently hold a stricter immigration  policy than Merkel in 2015, not just Orban
Good thing it's Windsor then lol
I think she is doing a good job myself too
Not that I like AP, H or really any of them that much
I see where you're coming from, and I definitely agree that we could have had someone worse
I don't exactly despise Solberg, I just don't like her that much because of her policies and party
And just to be clear, it's not that I dislike her as a person, just as a politician
I'm sure we'd get along just fine in real life
But I don't believe you can every really separate a politician from their party, since, after all, if they didn't agree with the party, why would they be leading it
I agree with you in that you can't separate them, but there is still a big distance between thinking someone is doing a good job and wholeheartedly supporting their party
I agree with some of Høyre's politic, but I am more on the left spectrum
However, I think that when Venstre, KrF, Høyre and (grøss) Frp joined forces, Erna was the obvious choice as PM
Saying I support her might be the wrong wording
I wouldn't vote for her, but between her and Siv Jensen, there is no question who is the best option
Yea, and because they changed it, it's changed and they aren't german lol
I love the fact that we have such a high tolerance for dialects
In Norway, you can speak your dialect everywhere you go and expect to be understood
It's not seen as informal or improper to speak in your regional dialect on TV, the radio, in public debates etc
Professors give lectures in their dialects, politicians use speak in their dialects when passing laws in parliament, musicians frequently use their dialects in their songs, and so on
This has helped Norway maintain a great level of linguistic diversity till this day and even young people (for the most part) still learn to speak the local dialect where they grow up
That we have so many dialects
I can easily tell from what area of the country someone is based on the first few words they say
I love the word 'koselig'. It cannot really be translated into English as it has a range of meanings: comfortable, nice, warm, homely, relaxed, friendly, safe, pleasant, lovely, jovial
And more
I love how I can drive for 15 mins and people won't understand what I say
Most languages have plenty of dialects, but what sets Norwegian apart from most of the others, is that dialects are actually tolerated and used in virtually all social contexts, even super-formal ones
We can even point out the city
We have it in Norwegian as well, but I never really hear anyone actively use it for some reason
>Lack of gendered words
Are you talking about Swedish now or am I missing something
Swedish does have genders
I had some German in school, but I never knew the word fro queue
I love it
In Norwegian the word is "kø", but "venteslange" would be so much more fun to use
Mostly completely fine unless you've been living under a rock with no exposure
Might take a minute to adjust yourself to listening to it though
In my case the area I come from have totally different words with no proper translation for a non-dialect version of the words
I can drive for 15 mins and people will struggle to understand things I say
We Norwegians have several
[Gravlax] In modern times made in a slightly more acceptable way, but  during the [Middle Ages] gravlax was made by fishermen, who salted the salmon and lightly [fermented] it by burying it in the sand above the high-tide line
Sounds gross, but tastes fantastic
In modern times it is cured using salt, sugar and dill
[Smalahåve] \-  The skin and fleece of the head are torched, the brain removed, and the head is salted, sometimes [smoked] and dried
The head is [boiled] or [steamed] for about three hours, and served with mashed [rutabaga] and [potatoes] It is also traditionally served with [Akvavit] In some preparations, the brain is cooked inside the skull and then eaten with a spoon or fried
I've personally mostly eaten the version with the brain intact, as it is a sign of "manliness" to eat the brain and the eye
Yeah, I know - silly
But OK
Still, the meat on the head is the best meat on the entire animal, and of course the tongue is pure heaven, so it is a delicious dish for those who doesn't mind ending the meal with the empty eye socket of a sheep's skull staring at you - hehe
[Lutefisk]  Lutefisk is dried [whitefish] (normally [cod] but [ling] and [burbot] are also used) treated with [lye] The first step is soaking the [stockfish] in cold water for five to six days (with the water changed daily)
The saturated stockfish is then soaked in an unchanged solution of cold water and lye for an additional two days
The fish swells during this soaking, and its [protein] content decreases by more than 50 percent, producing a [jelly] consistency
When this treatment is finished, the fish (saturated with lye) is inedible with a [pH] of 11–12
To make the fish edible, a final treatment of yet another four to six days of soaking in cold water (also changed daily) is needed
Eventually, the lutefisk is ready to be cooked
[\[2\]] Lutefisk is delicious when done right, but it is so hard to get right that I would say that eight out of ten times I eat it - it is not the way it should be
But done right, it is absolutely delicious
This is not a complete list, but for the sake of not making it too long, I'll stop here
Smalahove
A sheeps head, cut in half
Salted, dried and steamed, then placed on your plate
The first time you tear away the gums revealing the teeth is pretty nasty
Also, the eyes are considered a delicacy
They honestly don't taste much, so I suspect is is just something people say to seem cool
[Smalahove] is pretty delightful, cooked sheep’s head
Where do I start
Smalahove = sheep head
Yes that is a meal
Baked fish head
Idk why we eat heads(I don’t)
Kaviar = caviar, fish eggs
Tørrfisk = Dry fish, fish hanged to dry, smells disgusting but last essentially forever
Lutefisk = fish essentially pickled in lye
Edit: This is Norway btw
Norway has a couple:
- Leverpostei: a pâté like spread made from pork liver that is a staple bread topping in most Norwegian households
Usually very popular among kids too
It's not necessarily "disgusting" but most foreigners consider it a bit weird that kids eat liver on toast for breakfast
* Lutefisk: fish (usually cod) that has been dried, then pickled in lye (which is poisonous, ends up with a pH of 11-12), then cleaned, soaked (4-6 days usually, water changed daily) and then cooked/steamed
Served with boiled potatoes and a bacon and melted butter "sauce", among other sides
The fish has a very gelatinous texture, and is a very "love it or hate it" dish
Usually served around Christmas time
Fun fact: this dish can permanently corrode silverware if not cleaned immediately after
* Boiled fish head: straight up what it sounds like
A boiled head of cod (whole) that is traditionally served to the father/head of the house as it is considered "the best part of the fish". The tongue is especially highly regarded
Served with boiled potatoes and melted butter with parsley
* Rakfisk: fish, usually trout, that had been salted and fermented for a 2-3 months, up to a year
Served uncooked
I've had it with lefse (basically a potato based tortilla), a strong-ish cheese and dill
* Gravlaks: A personal favorite of mine
Salmon that has been cured in salt, sugar, dill (and sometimes other spices) for up to a week
Served uncooked with a sweet honey-mustard and dill sauce, often on top of bread
(this is legit one of my all-time favourite dishes
It is sooooo good
My dad makes a great one
We put Liver Paté on bread
It's really common and kids love it
Some people eat smalahove, which is a sheep head (even Norwegians find that one disgusting
I have one that isn't disgusting, but I saw an American complain about our waffles
The waffles u have taste like diabetes
Doesn't like all countries have this
We have Aspic dishes in Norway as well, and though they aren't on top of my list, I do enjoy eating them
I think even us fond this disgusting
Nothing wrong with Haggis really
We have something similar in Norway called Finker
&#x200B;
Biggest difference is that Finker isn't served with a poem and bagpipes playing ;) hehe
I agree on the pies, I'd consider going on a "pie tour of Britain" if someone ever put together such a thing
hehe
Frog legs - sure, had them a few times, they are good
Snails - OK, but the snails doesn't have much taste - so the few (7-10) times I tried it, it mostly tasted garlic :)
If you by old cheeses mean cheeses that smells like someone died a week a go - then yes - bring them - I love those
The last one, I haven't tried that exact dish, but I do love pigs trotters, and offal dishes can be good :)
It certainly is
And a thought popped into my head just now
There are so many delicious foods that has an ancestry that by current health and safety standards would never have been allowed
Gravlax is one, Lutefisk another, and in France - of course Blue Cheese and I'm sure you can think of others as well
So, perhaps one should ask - does current standards limit the creation of new and amazing food types
Hmmm - perhaps we should formulate that one better and put it forward as a question here in Reddit
I do love steak tartar as well, and once got a tuna version in a gourmet restaurant in Barcelona
You should try that one too if you can
Yeah, but atleast they have sauce and other stuff to hide the taste, and I have seen Norwegians eat nothing but dry fish and potatoes
I agree completely to that sentiment :)
Well, since pies does have more than a few calories - walking in between meals would be a jolly good idea
There are only two problems with that plan
One - English weather, and two - every time it started raining we'd end up on the nearest pub, which would be very nice but would make the trip quite hard to get done in the allotted time frame ;) hehe
I don't have any pies at home, but I do have beer
It'll have to do for now ;) hehe
Yes, we should absolutely do such a trip after all this is over
Tbh, the lack of sunlight
Not the temperature, I don’t mind the cold and haven’t been enjoying the last few 30+ degrees summers we have had, and the lack of snow during the winter
I enjoy the cold and the large amounts of snow
But what I cannot stand is the lack of sunlight
It’s dark when I go to school(08:00) and dark when I come home from school(16:00) there is sunlight between 09:00 and 13:00/14:00, so you only get to see it from the inside, and don’t get to actually experience it
And winter depression is very very real, and I and way too many others gets extremely affected by it
I think Canada is quite similar to the Nordic countries in many ways, except Canada is a huge country, the Nordics are small
As a Norwegian, sometimes Canada looks like what the US would be like if it was run by Norwegians
Here is a couple of things, but I am not sure it fits all the Nordic countries, but it does apply for Norway:
Most Nordic people have lived on small farms or secluded villages and very small towns for thousands of years
It has seeped into our personality and DNA
Personality wise we are small town folks
Some would admit that, some would claim they are very international and open minded
But the law of Jante is still living strong within many of us
If anything, that is the Nordic mentality you would meet if you did a road trip around all the Nordic countries
If you are a doctor, lawyer, engineer, any specialist with a long education and a sought after degree, your education will most likely be free, but your salary is substantially lower than if you had the same job in the US
Or Canada I would guess
Norway have unions that make deals with the government like "if you ask for a 2,2% raise instead of a 3,5%, the government promise inflation will be less than 1% instead of a 2,5% annual inflation". It keeps salaries down and helps export/import industries competing internationally
Cars are really expensive
This is not true for all Nordic countries (Sweden have Volvo (and used to have Saab), so it is different there)
But in Norway, if you like a car with a big engine, cars are extremely expensive
A sports car can cost allmost double in Norway than in other European countries or the US
Cars are partly taxed on Co2 emissions, engine size etc so whenever I hear a V8 engine coming down the street, I turn my head
That is why EVs are so popular, they have no extra tax so they are priced the same as in other countries (cheap by Norwegian standards)
It’s way too dark and cold in the winter
It rains a lot the rest of the year
In the winter, the snow and cold weather is nice for skiing and all, but annoying when you go about your life on cold or snow heavy days: Mowing snow off your house entrance, mowing snow off your car, scraping off extremely tough ice off your car windows, having to walk through untouched snow and getting wet, and so on
It’s a constant chore
In addition to the other things people have pointed out here I will address the cultural and social issues
Someone has already mentioned Janteloven, that you’re not allowed to be or do something, it’s restraining talents and competence as I see it
It may hinders Norway and Norwegians to prosper, search and pursue ideas
Education isn’t necessarily worth anything
This country seems built upon the idea that you in general shall not wish for anything more or better
Wanting cheese
Your supermarket has the same boring pasteurised cow milk cheese in 40 different brands
Live with it
Casual racism and homophobia is also pretty common, especially in more rural areas and among older people and less educated ones
Life can be pretty boring it seems outside of the bigger cities, depending on what you like
There isn’t usually much going on in the countryside or rural areas, little social meeting places, tiny amounts of businesses and shops etc
As known getting social contact up here can be pretty difficult in general
One HUGE problem for all the Nordic countries is that we are  ranked among the highest in terms of suicide rates
I think not a lot of people know this (especially the locals) but I think it's important to put out here
No one knows the reason for this but one theory could be that Nordic people tend to be more reserved and mostly keep to themselves
What do you guys think
How can the countries known for being the best to live in also have one of the highest suicide rates
Another problem is the 'taboo' topics we have here
My impression is that at least for us Norwegians, talking about not having enough money or struggling in life is something I find most Norwegians rarely talk about
As for the darkness, I don't mind that as much as I do with the temperature here
It gets pretty cold
What bothers me the most is the amount of selections available here
Grocery stores are exactly the same
They sell the exact same thing, just at different prices
One exception is 'Meny' who at least has a reasonable amount of import food
Food you don't really get at the other stores
When it comes to import food it's close to zero here
Everything is locally produced
I think it's good that we have food and products made locally here but I believe it needs to be a more 'mix'. That's just my opinion
Then of course there are the taxes for absolutely everything
I have one of those midnattsol-lights, it works wonders
Edit, [Lysterapilampe]
Also the rain, specially in rain cities like Bergen
280 times a year is too damn high
It depends on where you live in norway, i also live here and it doesn’t get dark until 17:00 in the winter
You nailed it
I never thought of the fact that we tend to not dare to ask too many (nosy) questions, but that is so true
Reminds me of a American who were amazed that a Norwegian cashier was able to afford going to the US for holiday
First of all amazed that they were able to take 3 weeks off work to go anywhere
secondly that they were able to afford the plane ticket and stay in the US
But since a cashier earn maybe only 17,200 euro per year in the US, you can understand their confusion
In some extent yes
Depending on where you live, it seems more common to marry younger in more rural areas and far north than it does in Oslo
It’s much about a cultural thing I guess
> There is also a non negligible living cost
If you come from the outside, sure
But if you live and _work_ here, your point is useless
I may actually invest in one of those
Thank you
I just bought one of those
Do you use it with advice from a doctor or are you freestyling
Some nights it doesn’t even go dark really
But if you go further north in Norway, the sun will be up 24-7 in the summer, and they will not see the sun from November-February
It looks like there is
There are statistics, reports and research done on it
It simulates natural sunlight
Fools me :)
Just freestyling ;) A few hours in the afternoon does the trick
Edit: Tyrkleif
You live north of Svalbard
Next sunrise in Longyearbyen is mid February
Depends on person to person of course, but they’re more likely to spend their 20s studying, living, have fun, try to get a career and just not settle down yet
You find somewhere to work first, then you worry about somewhere to live
That's how it works :-) Also, poor people in Norway aren't as poor as in other countries
Sure we got _extremley_ poor people, but those are few
Yeah, or therapy light
The wake up clock light things are a bit cheap and not very good IMO
And what was the explanation
I see your point, but that's not the criterion for when the sun rises
You can head up to the nearest mountain and see the sun rise from there
It's sort of like saying you don't see the sun rise when you're in your basement
Just because humans decided to settle in the shadow of a mountain doesn't mean the sun doesn't rise on the other side
Bitte sehr
Ok, okay, okei etc is pretty commen in Norway
Im pretty shure its a loan word from english here
I hear it quite a bit in Norway
It can be pronounced just as often in the English form as it is with the Norwegian (sounds like oh-kuu)
Very common here, we write ok the same way but okay is okei
I am not sure if it is an official word but it’s sp common that it should get added
Hey buddy, we still independent, also we are very very rich now
"We found oil"
So it turns out it wasn’t just fish in the sea
Oil
That everything worked out well for the entire period except for a short few years of 1940-45
I’d tell this person that we suffered through a new world war, this time Norway was much more directly involved than the first one, but we got through german occupation and found oil in the North Sea
We are now rich because of it, so your average Joe today is much better off than back in his time, where Norway was still a young, developing nation lagging behind our Scandinavian neighbours
I would tell him how Gerhardsen and his labour party basically built a new nation from scratch after the war, that we will have our most prosperous period ever (and still going on) and try to explain why the biggest issue for people today are toll plazas and not starving to death
"...although it turns out that 'stay neutral and lie low' trick only works once
When it comes to history, boring is good
Sirup på blodpølse
Norsk blodpølse er omtrent lik tror jeg, smaker litt søtt med kanel/kardemomme aktig smak
Jeg vet det høres rart ut men jeg vokste opp med sirup på blodpølse, det er noe med søtheten og den sprø brente smaken
Jeg ser absolutt verdien i å balansere søtt med surt, så kanskje jeg skal prøve med tyttebær neste gang
Probably true
Can't really remember having learned anything other than the potato famine that caused people to go to America and The Troubles
Any interesting parts you suggest I read up on or movies/documentaries I watch
Awesome
Cheers buddy
The most modern looking place in norway is probably barcode in Oslo
[The so called Barcode area in Oslo
Second this
[Wiki]
Don't tell /r/Avoid5 about that place
In dialects from northern Norway (where many of the villages named Å are located), it's possible to have a (slightly meaningful) conversation with only vowels:
>Person A: "Æ e i Å, æ."
>Person B: "Å? Æ e i Å æ å!"
meaning:
>Person A: "I'm in Å."
>Person B: "Oh
I'm in Å as well
I live like 5 minutes away from a "Li" here
i find the same with germanor even dutch, i can somewhat understand the writing but not really the spoken form
Almost, if not literally every name in the Norwegian Harry Potter series
* Professor Bumblebee-spin
* ... and McPurse
* ...and Sly-clever (though to be fair, at least it's a portmanteau in Norwegian)
* Quirrell turned into something that sounds like a pastry
Like, let's go ahead and name one of the primary villains in this book "pritzel".
* Dolores Jane Umbridge ["umbrage"] is now Venke (generic old-fashioned girl's name, in a weird spelling) Dolorosa "Uffert" (no meaning, sounds dumb as shit)
* ... then a few others that don't sound like anything at all (Flitwick is "Pirrevimp", for example)
Then of course there's
* the kidnapping, torture and murder victim Berta Flurp (no, that doesn't mean shit either, and it sounds jarringly idiotic)
* The respected textbook author Miranda Pogo-stick
* The Weasleys are Wildsons
* Malfoy is Malfang, for no discernible reason and with no clear meaning, either
* Granger just lost the "er", also for no clear reason
* Bones became "legging" or "boning", your choice
* Goyle became Gargle
Crabbe became
well, actually "crab", which is *definitely* better than average
* The Irish dude went from Finnegan or whatever into Finnimann or something, absolutely no sense
Just about the only defensible change in the entire fucking series is Tom Marvolo Riddle becoming Tom Dredolo Venster, and only because the anagram gag had to work out somehow
For bonus points: "Baggins" was turned into (by the same guy, I have no fucking doubt) "Pocket-cozy".
In the case of LotR, Tolkien himself intended proper names to be translated into something with the same connotations in the target language
"Frodo Baggins" is supposed to be an English translation of the character's name in the fictional language Westron, Maura Labingi
The Harry Potter names are rather badly translated
Dumbledore is "Humlesnurr", which means bumblebee-spin, a word that sounds very
kids-y. The Golden Snitch is "Gullsnoppen", where "snoppen" is a sort of cuteish slang for dick
I love the translations into Norwegian
Sure, some of them are better than others, but remember that these are children's books, and the intended audience would have had no chance at catching most of the connotations the original names are meant to have in English
The translations aren't necessarily intended to translate the names' *meanings* literally, but rather the feelings they evoke
And yes, the same guy (Torstein Bugge Høverstad) translated both the *Harry Potter* books and *The Lord of the Rings*. He's brilliant
Also, when it comes to Tolkien, most people in this entire thread seem woefully unaware that Tolkien actually created [a guide for how to translate names in *The Lord of the Rings*] which most translations since the guide's release have benefitted from
So if you're going to blame anyone for "weird" translations of names in LOTR, blame Tolkien himself
Yep
Midgard, that is
Well, all names have some meaning
But the literal meaning of Harry's name doesn't have any significance in the books
It's not like he's really into making vases or anything
I think the meaning behind Harry's name is that he's just a regular English kid, with a common English name
... shit, I forgot about Frank
What the fuck
>The translation of Harry Potter looks like a swede tried to make fun of Norwegians, but you did that shit yourself
Accurate
They even called the snitch "snopp".
This
I'll defend the norwegian HP translation till the day I die
Yes
It seemed like one of those thing that are put there to make the grownups laugh but fly under the radar with the kids
It is really strange considering Georg is a pretty common name
Not personally, being an atheist from a different country
I realize, respect and regret that there's a lot of damage being done though, it's a tragedy from a historical perspective alone
I hate seeing historical stuff get destroyed
A thing people forget is that it was also the birthplace of «modern» music
The idea of melodies on top of one another was concieved within those walls
YES im literally shaking and crying, this is so bad
Wow, I really don't want to find out how this could be given a racist spin
Happy birthday :)
Fuck those idiots
Here in Norway the police advise people to call them rather than complain directly
I do not like that, the police should be for crimes
> Its one of the first responses/complaints I here from foreigners about Germany
> We like to stare, a lot
I've been to Germany many times, but never saw anyone staring
Absolutely, I agree
No need to escalate the situation in person if you already complained and they ignored it
My husband speaks Afrikaans
He understands everything the Dutch say
They don't understand anything of what he says
I would assume they're quite mutually intelligible
To me, as a Norwegian they all sound mostly like a combination of dunken cheers, sneezes and coughs interspersed with words that are unmistakably Norwegian
I believe they're all lost Scandinavian tribes that settled there during the Viking age, caught a nasty cold and started drinking
Since they all sound the same, they probably understand each other too
Not at all
They're just languages
The thoughts behind what I vocalize are exactly the same
Of course people from rural areas and small towns hate Oslo and Oslo people
Since it, like most other capitals, is the economic center of the nation, there's a lot of rich people there, and rich people are generally disliked
Myself, I freaking love Oslo
And during my years of living there, and also after I moved away, I've gotten to know a lot of people there, many of them are absolute down to earth super fine people just like the rest of the country
I would say that Oslo is generally quite liked, but basically everyone sees the people who live in west-Oslo as rich snobs
Yes ours
Oslo is generally well liked from what I know
At least I don't know of anyone who dislikes it
In Norway Oslo is worshipped even though it is the worst city
I've traveled to most of the European countries, and I really love Vilnius
Come on, Copenhagen is gorgeous
Did you like it more than Tallinn
Co-signed
Yeah, I found Vilnius and Lithuania more friendly to be honest
It was also very easy to get around, great nightlife and nice architecture
If by foreign you also mean English, then yes
I've yet to meet another Norwegian who doesn't speak English
Unless they're a child, of course
most people speak english, but we dont use it much other than on the internet
It’s expected that you know English if you’re younger than 50
We also have to learn a third language in school, but the expectations for learning those are significantly lowered
Cool to hear that you want to learn Norwegian
You can check out the subreddit /r/norsk for resources and help from natives or others in the same situation
Where does your mother live
Yes, except if you are visiting someone for a house party or pre-drinks and need to cool the beverages you brought (and it’s pretty much always BYOB)
Then it’s absolutely socially accepted
Maybe along with a polite “Hey I’ll put these in your fridge if you don’t mind”, but I’d be surprised if anyone told me no
Same for Norway
Swedish football's domestic supporter culture
It's just head and shoulders above the rest of the nordics
They do have more people but still, the Stockholm clubs especially have great support, and they got some fantastic rivalries
We need more of that here, Oslo is abseloutley dead
The Danes are like us but more chill
Edit: looks like another Norwegian already wrote the exact same thing
Sweden: Just feels like a more ambitious and international version of Norway
I feel like Swedes could fit in any place in the world, but still be Swedish if that makes sense
Their ultras (football fans) are always better then Norwegian ones as well
Unless you are from Scania their language is also beautiful
Denmark: I feel like Norwegians either identify more with Sweden or Denmark
I am the latter
Hygge is so nice
I also enjoy Danish art and culture products more than Swedish ones
Finland: The only people in the world that are funnier than Brits are Finns
Honestly, their style of dark humour is next level
The Swedes are very good at making music, maybe as good as the UK or USA (but scaled down in terms of population, of course)
Also, you do your best at winter sports and it's adorable
Sweden has a national cinnamon roll day
I respect that
Sweden are good at making quality-stuff for the general public (Ikea and Volvo-cars for example)
Finland are very cool and special (in a good way)
Russia has a lot of culture and history
Denmark has alot of good food, nice beaches and are very laid-back
Iceland is beautiful and a very special place to travel to
> Finland/Norway: good poltical culture, seem like organized and efficient people
Thanks
And I like brick houses
All our houses are wooden
And wooden houses are definitely more common here than in Sweden
Wasn't the www invented at CERN
Mongolia is like number 1 on my travel list
I find central Asia to be quite an alluring part of the world, in big part because of the reason OP listed, that we never really hear about them, so there is somewhat of a mystery to the place
Also obscenely big statues fascinate me so I really want to go see the Ghengis Khan one
I can't remember it too clearly but I love the idea and concept, even though it perhaps didn't have as much interest as it should have
My team Lillestrøm even managed to come to the final one year so I'd love to see a return of it honestly
Sorry to hear that

Ohhhh
I actually thought it was a town called Alko
Now I get it
You can't use a surname as a given name, unless it has a history or tradition as a given name, either in Norway or elsewhere, or has a tradition in a culture that doesn't distinguish between given names and surnames
Apart from that, there are no rules for given names (there are some more rules for surnames), except the most important one: The name can be rejected if it will be a severe liability for the person, or if other strong reasons apply
It's intentionally vague so that it can be used to reject everything from Vidkun Quisling to X Æ A-12
Yes, § 8
and § 10
[here]
§ 8
You can't choose a first name that has been in use as a last name
§ 10
You can't choose a name that will be a disadvantage to the person
Yes, I think I have heard that there is a list of approved names and if you choose a name outside of the list you need to ask to get it approved
Icelandic names must have case declensions, follow Icelandic writing (no C's, for instance), and not embarrass (hurt) the person named
A maximum of three first names can be given a person
If memory serves, there are around 1800 female names and 1700 male names approved
My personal favorite is [The Viking Ship Museum] where you can walk amongst authentic viking ships and other viking artifacts
It could also be [The Norwegian museum of cultural history]
My gf and I visited pergamon two years ago
It was very impressive and had lots of things to see
Unfortunately we didn’t have enough time to visit the other museums, but would love to come back
I definitely can recommend the Pergamon museum to other tourists
i mean technically techinally, the Vatican IS *in* Italy
This place is amazing
It has to be the [Nobel Peace Center] for me
> I loved the Vigeland Sculpture Park
My favourite place in Oslo
I remember my parents talked English, but it didn't last very long as it didn't take that long till I could understand them
I remember them talking in English when I was very young
Although we start learning English in 1st grade so I remember around that age I'd often be able to figure out roughly what they were talking about so they stopped doing that when I was still quite young
We use English
It doesn't last long before the kids learn it though
I try other languages sometimes, but I don't know so much German, French or Spanish
Norwegian comedy group with a sketch about exactly this
No subtitles, but you get the gist
English, or you spell the word out
Neither method will work on children above the age of 7
Its never annoying when someone puts in the effort to learn a new language
It would be easier if they'd just speak English, but it's very charming
For me it depends a lot on context
If someone approach me to speak a very broken Norwegian, I will ask if English is easier (because I might not have the time to listen to someone stumbling through pronunciation and trying to piece together some meaning)
My experience is usually a huge look of relief and a functional and effective English conversation lol
If it’s someone who is learning Norwegian for actual speaking Norwegian purposes, I will do my best to spend time having the conversation with them
But the common tourist who has learned phrases, and isn’t capable of understanding a fully functional reply
nah
Not very helpful
I have the “textbook” dialect (like my mom calls it lol, not because it’s the superior dialect, but because my dialect is as close as it gets to the written bokmål you will find in textbooks and tourist guides), so I’m a good person to practice on
Many many places in Norway feature dialects far away from the written form
Just go with english, if you can, 90% of us speak it very well
It's annoying if they expect me to change how I speak so they can understand me
But it depends on context
If it's someone I know, I'm much more accommodating
If a tourist asks me something in clearly broken Norwegian, my answer will always be in English
It's 100% certain they won't understand my dialect
I read through the comments to see if anyone in Finland commented
Sadly they didn't.
Hell, I feel like I need a drink after trying to speak and understand Danish
Especially in Norway since everyone here speaks English
Yeah, if they are able to speak English and their Norwegian is horrible, I would very strongly prefer it if they just spoke English instead
I find it awkward to ask people to switch to English because then I’m basically telling them their Norwegian is bad
Plus it’ll take forever if they aren’t familiar with the local dialect and I have to repeat myself all the time
I have become annoyed by it before, but the poor people didn’t speak English either, so it wasn’t really their fault, I think I was just frustrated and wanted it to end
It certainly doesn't help though, to answer OP's question
I'd say we understand English a million times better than tourists understand Norwegian
Yeah
But
Then it doesn’t help their confidence in Norwegian
If English is just spoken for them
I agree with your main point, but the “danger” of automatically switching to English without asking, is that what if for example you just didn’t hear them properly and they weren’t as bad as you actually thought
Do you only switch if you’re completely sure it’s hopeless, when you’re sure their Norwegian really is that bad
That is interestingly the case with English as well, but at least you can blame William and the French influence
I assume he is still working on it and still not very fluent
Often people switch to English because they think it is more efficient and easier
I think it is bit of a cultural thing
We are not much of talkers to strangers, and if we can do something to get "out" of that situation we will do it
Sucks for your brother though, that wants to learn the language
Me personally would answer in my dialect if I was talked to in Norwegian and switch to English if not understood
The "standard" you refer too is an eastern Norwegian dialect, and I will not personally switch to it, that is a loss
Edit
I also find English easier than switching dialect, won't be as artificial or weird
"Standard" dialect in Norway is far less seen as a standard than in many other countries
E.g. news presenters still use their local dialects
We don’t really do that
If you ask us a question in bad Norwegian we’ll answer in our own dialect
Some might try to avoid a few certain, specific words if they know from experience that people often get confused by them
The thing about Norwegian is that all dialects are considered equal, and it's almost seen as a weakness of character if you change your dialect if you move somewhere else
There is no standard Norwegian, but Oslo area dialect is what you will hear the most in media, and it's the dialect taught to foreigners
The result is that for me, it's much easier to speak English than change the way I speak Norwegian so a foreigner can understand it
And the difference between my dialect and understandable Norwegian for a beginner is about the same as if I had to switch to Swedish
Dude you’re complaining people aren’t willing to adjust their speech in their own country, you realize that’s ridiculous, right
>Native English speakers adapt our speech to non-natives all the time and rarely feel put out by the situation
Well good for you, then you do that
>You’re just forcing the other person to change their way of speech instead
Your choice, plus you’re the one in a different country
>Your English likely isn’t as amazing as some would lead you to believe, and that’s okay
Well that just sounded rude
>It still requires extra effort for a native English speaker to understand, though
And it might require extra effort for us to talk to you
>Why is it so common for people in other countries to feel it’s not their responsibility to try when somebody makes an effort in a non-English language
Because it is not our responsibility
> I’m pretty much fluent in Swedish now but I had this issue at lot, especially at the beginning of learning
I’ve had to resort to pretending I don’t speak English just to get somebody to speak to me in Swedish
Well I personally believe people should usually respond back in the same language as they were asked, and ask before switching to English if it was necessary, and that in most cases it’s rude to not do this
But at at the very beginning of learning people might be so terrible that it’s not even possible to know what their saying, so some might prefer not to even give them the choice
It’s also annoying when someone who is very bad at the language wants to bother you by asking for help, when they are able to ask in English which would make it all quicker
But it depends on the situation
Once the learner is good enough in the language that it would go smoothly with the local language, I believe one should stick to that language instead of switching to English just because the other person sound foreign
>I mean, I’m sure you don’t just switch to English when you have a hard time understanding somebody with a speech defect or a learning disability
What
No because it wouldn’t make difference
I'm not the one initiating conversation in this scenario, so I'm not obligated to speak in any way I don't feel comfortable with
If you have problems understanding me, that's your problem, not mine
And as I said, it depends on context
If you're someone I know who is trying to learn the language, I'll do everything I can to help you (and I have done that in the past), but if I don't know you and you expect me to speak to you slowly in a completely different dialect, you can honestly fuck right off
And I also don't think you should change the way you speak to non-native speakers if you don't feel comfortable with it, if you're on the receiving end
Even some native Norwegians have trouble with my dialect if they haven't been exposed to it, so if someone approaches me and there's any indication they're not a native speaker, I switch, because I know from experience that there's no way we can have a meaningful conversation in Norwegian
That being said, I don't mind that they continue speaking in Norwegian if they want, but I won't waste time with my dialect
Even during
They don’t meant that we don’t speak Norwegian here, they mean that all of us are able to speak English as well
I’ve unfortunately heard of people who have been here for many years and are fluent (with a obvious, but easily understood, accent) and that have actually experienced being answered in English by people working in stores
These people (the ones speaking English) don’t seem to realize how extremely rude that is, and obviously not helpful at all in those situations
Of course it’s possible some of them are so used to dealing with foreigners that struggle with the language that their brain automatically switches to English at the sign of an accent/foreign looks, but they should learn to stop and think about what they’re doing, and learn to ask before switching (if it’s necessary to switch), especially when dealing with customers
(But if some random person or someone you don’t want to talk to starts talking to you, I totally understand just switching to English to get out of it
So if anyone reads this and think they are guilty of it, become more aware of what you’re doing
Yeah
I feel really awkward whenever I have to use eastern dialect words to get understood (mostly when speaking with danes or swedes)
I'd rather just switch to English in that case
Then they should probably make that clear, so the native can decide if that's something they want/have the time for/etc
It's not the job of every random person you meet on the street (or worse, in a service job) to teach you their language
But if you ask and they say they're comfortable doing that, then that's cool
I’m looking at it from an Immigrant perspective
Tourists yeah I get it for sure
But I have seen so many Immigrants play the “English Card” and take the easier way out, or natives giving them the easy way out
Yeah I get that, and if they’re just a random person on the street you don’t really owe them anything
But I think that unless you are sure they are terrible at Norwegian, in many cases it would be good to think it through
Someone who has an accent could have lived here for half/most of their life and be used to the strangest dialects
It would feel very rude to them if they were replied to in English
I feel like many Norwegians’ thresholds for switching are becoming a bit low
I know of people who have been here for many years (we’re talking a decade or two or more, but you can clearly hear they aren’t native) and have experienced people working in stores replying to them in English
In those cases it’s obviously extremely rude
But it seems like it happens more the more “acceptable” it becomes to switch, and it seems like it’s becoming more and more acceptable
Is it a good thing to be shy
I used to have a Spanish gf who was pretty shy and introverted, whereas I’m really talkative and outgoing, so it was kinda fun how we broke each other’s countries’ stereotypes lol
Then foreigners have a leg up on Norwegians, because we don't learn a standard dialect
We learn the dialect we speak through osmosis, and then we learn a written standard language
Technically if we try we would be able to switch dialects
The thing is that we are normally not willing to do that
Most likely if Norwegians realize that you struggle a bit, they might talk a bit slower
And like I said, they might avoid some specific words if it causes confusion, like words that they don’t use that often and they know is very specific to their dialect
A few times I’ve been extra nice and switched some common words I actually use a lot, because I was having a little conversation with someone who was struggling but wants to learn
I have also spoken sentences in eastern dialect
But I only did so because I was willingly helping someone to learn the language, I wouldn’t really do that normally, even if someone finds my dialect difficult
Oh so you think it’s a negative thing then
Jeg
All these can be translated to I, probably not the worst offender either
I guess you could say that we are very proud of our dialects
It shows people where we grew up, we keep them when we move away and it would be considered strange if someone changed their dialect
Switching to a more “standardized” version (like what foreigners learn, similar to how we might sound like when we read out loud)  seems like an extreme measure
Maybe it is kind of like one of your suggestions, that it’s also knowing that one is not better or worse than the other
It’s also not very common to “go the extra mile” for people you don’t know well
People might help out someone they know or take a liking to, but usually don’t really want to bother it with some stranger
Also, it feels unnatural and you remain conscious of the fact that you’re speaking differently, and as soon as you relax you might start mixing in your own again
So it might not work in a setting where you’re doing other things at the same time (like work situation)
Like you see here, some prefer English more than switching
Also a lot of people probably never even considered the possibility, most of the time it doesn’t even cross my mind that it’s an alternative
I started being more aware that it was even a possibility as I started uni and met more people from other places, and even now I usually forget it
Earlier I think I had only thought about it when it came to Swedes and Danes
So since your are talking English and come from france you are part of the same problem in your country
How so
Damn for some reason I just assumed Poles could understand Russians and Ukrainians
So what’s left, Belarusian and Czechian
Actually if your Swedish becomes good enough that it doesn’t sound very wrong to a Norwegian, there’s a good chance of them making an effort to speak Norwegian with you instead of just switching to English, especially those that aren’t that young
There’s a little “pressure” to try to speak our own languages when speaking to other Scandinavians, instead of just switching to English
Also, older generations in general (not like elderly , but like from 40/50+ maybe) are more likely to want to avoid speaking English and prefer in to speak Norwegian
The people that just suddenly switch to English ([even when it’s rude
I gave an example somewhere else)]
are usually younger generations
As a bonus, the older generations are also better at Swedish (to understand it and know which Norwegian words might confuse Swedes and use a different word, even a Swedish word, instead)
Thanks for the information, I had never even heard about Sorbian and Kashubian
For some reason the word Silesian sounds really familiar even though I don’t know why, maybe Ive seen someone mentioned it on this subreddit before or something
Good luck with learning Swedish
I have to admit I think it’s a pretty language
You might not get very far with Swedish in the Denmark, the closest towns might be more used to Swedish though, but Danish is really difficult to understand
Like even for me it’s super hard, and can be actually impossible depending on the person speaking (but many Norwegians are better at it than me)
You probably know better than me how it is in Finland
I’m also really curious if Icelandic people would be able to understand it, I gotta do some research on that
I had no idea about any of that, this was a very interesting read
Thank you so much for taking the time to educate me a little
> Danish is even calles Danish, because when you stuff a danish into your mouth you will speak Danish
Hahaha hadn’t heard that one before
Yeah the reason I was wondering about Iceland is that they apparently learn Danish is school as well, but I have no idea how much they actually retain and if it’s enough to understand Swedish
Would actually be really cool to learn Icelandic or norse
I was going to say sulphur, but then I saw OP's country flair and decided it might be unnecessarily redundant
Kind of like the phrase "unnecessarily redundant".
Like a mix of fish and sheep, but if that smell was like a nice, fresh, earthy, rain smell
And for Hirtshals: Fish
Oh God I love Denmark
Ok, I'm moving to your place the very second Covid ends
I went to the Naples suburbs a few years back and we got lost
We stopped on the side of the small road to look at the map, and then SUDDENLY a wild Ferrari fucking flew by, absolutely zooming for at least 100-120 km/h (speed limit must've been 50)
I guess it was a 10 or 12 cylinder eninge based on the noise
And that noise, I tell you, that noise made me almost piss my pants
My small town is a fairly rich town, but I don't think more than probably one of the inhabitants have proper luxury sports cars, so it's rare for me to see
Let alone hear it going at full speed
It's greasy and gamey
I don't know, honestly
I've only had duck once, and that was about 20 years ago, but if I remember correctly, duck was a lot more tender
I'm vegetarian, so my meat reference isn't too exact
"You're vegetarian but you know what bear tastes like
", you may be asking
That's because I'm a shitty vegetarian, and when I have the opportunity to try a bit of meat from an unusual animal, I'll go for it
Haha
That was a delightful story
What did it actually taste like
I always imagine that things like that and roadkill taste like actual garbage
That reminds me of a story of a friend of mine from New Zealand
There's a local bird in that country called a kereru or wood pigeon, and they're protected
They're only allowed to be hunted in very controlled quantities, and only by the Maori, using traditional hunting methods
This made it all the more forbidden fruit to my friend's mother, who thought they looked so plump and delicious
One day a kereru got drunk on fermented berries, flew into a window, and died
So my friend's mother took the opportunity to cook it and eat it
By all accounts it did not taste very good at all, but my friend and his family now know that for sure, thanks to his resourceful mother
Edit for extra meat: one fantastic unusual meat I tried was muskox prosciutto
It was so light and salty and complex, I'd definitely try it again
Technically the Norwegian population is decreasing, the only thing keeping our numbers up are immigration
We birth too few children
And as I am in my late teens I can’t really say I have noticed a difference, but maybe someone older than me have
My father says he has noticed huge changes, mainly that many workers are no longer Norwegian fluent
I.e delivery people, customer service and other
Edit: typo
Yes
It's less harmful than tobacco and alcohol, which are perfectly legal, and it's not addictive (Heard from people, not tried it myself)
> high people never make problems
Unless it's famine because the munchies got a bit out of hand, I guess
Sounds about right
Must be all of that [checks note] "REEFER"
Maybe he's stoned
I though the iron curtain was an actual iron wall of some kind
I was young
In 1992, I went to a jamboree scout camp in Germany
By then the border from DK was definitely not as open as now
I remember the grenzepolizei entering and looking through the bus checking everyone's passports, and probably in the luggage compartment
What made the most impression on me: the polizei was armed
At least with a glock in their belt, maybe also an automatic gun
It was my first encounter with a: the police, and b: guns
Thank goodness they made us bigger
We would almost not be visible otherwise
> I think 99% of people think Finland is a part of scandinavia
You could just as well been part of Scandinavia
That's pretty recent
Same in Norwegian
I know
But part of northern Finland is in fact part of the Scandinavian peninsula
But you have a Norwegian username
Anyways, decently snowy winters in the past few years here in south of Norway, but very mild this year
No snow now or forecasted next ten days
May turn around though, quite common for February to be snow heavy
It can even snow a lot in March
Lisbon (probably my favourite city
Been there just once but I can’t wait to go back
Madrid (love the atmosphere, easy to get around on a very good metro system, lots of history and it’s not too touristy
I almost put Seville in this spot but Madrid edges it due to being much bigger and metropolitan like)
London (food, shopping, history, new and old architecture
London literally has everything and it’s so much more than Oxford Street)
Copenhagen (very cool and relaxed city
For me it feels very much like home but bigger and a little better)
Krakow (the city centre is beautiful
It’s cheap and there’s lots of good food
Only thing I’m not into is the increasing conservatism and racist/homophobic attitude of the country and it was somewhat noticeable when we were there)
I see several people recommend Bergen
And yes its very nice, just remember to bring an umbrella
So Bergen, Isola Bella, Copenhagen, Vienna, Krakow in the right order
Special is Porto
Is special Porto
Porto special is
I’m buying from smaller artisanal roasters, usually local ones to Oslo like Tim Wendelboe, Supreme Roastworks, Fuglen and Kaffa among others
I'm not very picky when it comes to coffee as long as it doesn't taste sour
We in the nordics drink the most coffee per capita, so I guess it has been perfected for quite a while due to is popularity
Top coffee drinking countries per capita per year:
Finland - 12 kg
Norway - 9
9 kg
Iceland - 9 kg
Denmark - 8
7 kg
Sweden - 8
My girlfriend (samboer) is half polish and grew up in Sweden before she moved to Norway in her '20s.
It works great, but then again we are hardly talking about the biggest cultural differences here
I haven't dated a lot, but briefly dated a Japanese girl while I was on exchange in Australia
We bonded over our different cultures and our love for food
And the fact we both spoke 3-4 languages (with only English in common)
Most of our dates were focused around trying some new food that at least one of us hadn't tried yet, and talking about our different cultures as well as talking about Australia
And teaching each other words and frases in our respective languages
Honestly, I kinda find being from another culture to be an attractive quality
Probably because my parents are from different countries themselves, and I've spent over a decade of my life living abroad (I'm in my mid 20s)
Same in Norway
Well, there's the Swedish radio host (on Norwegian radio) who, when asked what she had been up to over the weekend, said something like "jag har bare pulat" (pardon my Swedish)
In Swedish it means roughly "I've just been doing small things here and there" (I don't know if there's a good English word for it), but in Norwegian it means "I've just been fucking".
This is something a lot of Norwegians struggle with as well, and that's the difference between "kj" sounds and "skj" sounds
skj is the "sh" in English, while "kj/ki" sounds very similar, but is slightly "lighter". Imagine forming your mouth to say "ee", but say "sh" instead while keeping that position
Now,, there are very few words that distinguish between the two, but the worst offender is "kjede" and "skjede".
"Kjede" = Chain
"Skjede" = Vagina
Only pronunciation difference is a slightly different "sh" sound
That said, most people ignore this, skjede is rarely used these days and it's always very obvious which one you're talking about
My dad’s Polish neighbour once wanted to ask why my dad wasn’t married to his live-in-parter (yet)
«Hvorfor er dere ikke giftig
» the neighbour asked
This means «Why are you (two) not poisonous
Gift=married
Giftig=poisonous
Lmao
Reminds me of tadpoles in Norwegian (rumpetroll) which literally means ass-troll
It might be regional, I don't know
She explained that it meant the same as the Norwegian word "pusle (med)". I'm probably paraphrasing how she said it, but the way she said it made it crystal clear that she had been fucking all weekend (in Norwegian), and it was some version of "pula".
The only "generation" we talk about often is the "generation of '68", ie
the people who were young/students during the [protests of 1968]
Hmm, interesting
I wonder why stuff like WWII defined clearer generational boundaries (at least in the cultural perception) in the US than in Europe, where the war actually took place for the most part
That's surprising, it's very much a thing [
Dalen Hotell (in Dalen, Norway)
There was a woman who checed into the hotel while she was heavily pregnant
Upon arrival she was acting really strange, always checing over her shoulder, jumping at the slightest sounds and being just generally nervous
She stayed in room 17 over night, and when she left the next morning, she was childless, not pregnant, no child on her arm, nothing
The child was never found
Nobody knows what happened, but many guests who have stayed in the corridor room 17 is in, say they have heard baby cries in the night
Room 17 is now knows as 'The ghost room' and you can still stay there if you want to
The hotell is really pretty, so I would recomend staying here or just checking it out if you ever is in Vest-Telemark
(Fun fact: I'm at the holtell rn, in my sisters confirmation, we can't go into room 17, becuse it is locked)
Okay, so I re-read the story and the woman was Lady Greenfield from england, she was on her way home from the hotel when she was informed that she would go to court for the potentiall murder of her child, but she killed herself before the trial began
Now she is also at the hotel (something I forgot when fist posting) and I don't think she murdered her child
Or at least she felt bad about it
Because it is adviced agains placing anything in the crib in room 17
It doesn't stand what will happen if you do, but I think maybe you'll get misfortune or Lady Greenfield will appear
Men are espechally prone to notice her precence in the room
(Sorry for grammar/spelling, I'm on the phone rn)
I have a friend who was eating out in Canada
She said **SHIT** really loud
Everyone got quiet and looked at her
('Shit' is not bad at all over here, children may say it as much as they like
It basically just means "dirt".)
How strong is the phrase "Not bloody likely
What does it mean in north America I wonder
Since here it literally means "dirt".
Ah ok
So if I say "POOP" a bit too loud while in a restaurant, will I get the same reaction as when I say "SHIT"?
Some dialects here in Norway has one letter word when referring to themselves like "I"
Theres: i, e, æ, depends on where in Norway you are
Also the word for to do something i.e (å) gå, to walk
Also i = in
we’ve got the shortest place name to
which is just ‘Å’
and in older dialects we can day ‘ø’ for island
The danes have a stroke whenever they talk
They’re used to it
We have it in Norwegian too, but only with the latter definition
That word sure comes in handy
>I still hold out that their usage of the Latin alphabet is a long practical joke
Says the Brit :P
It's not rude to talk about by itself, but it's sort of rude to ask and expect an answer
Yes, it’s a bit rude
I van come off as bragging and that’s like the worst thing you can do in a social setting
I think you should always be able to talk about your income
It's rude to brag about it, but as a part of cenversation about work or life in general it is just another subject that should be broached
With close family it isn't an issue, but it's not a deeply discussed issue with friends as most of us earn nothing as students or veeeery little
I'm pretty open person as long as others share first and I don't feel like I'm being used
Also everyone's income can be checked online, so if you're really interested you can check how much they earn
Though those you check will get an update that you have accessed their earnings
I think they are about equally as common in Norway
Those are the best
Samí is an official language here
I think
And I can't speak it at all
But most Samí people can speak Norwegian
Yeah they walk alone to school, if the school is close enough to walk or course
I walked alone (without parents, but with my sister who also went to the same school) from second grade
For children living in walking distance to the school it's common to walk alone to school from the age of 7
And bicycle to school from the age of 10
Yes they walk alone in the city but it also depends on the age
If both were to be combined it's probably one of us (scandinavians), but maybe not the Danes, probably Iceland
Iceland is not Scandinavian, you’re thinking of the Nordic countries
I disagree
Alcohol is a major part of Nordic culture, and we all produce a lot
But of course I would have to see some statistics to be sure
While it is true Scandinavia means just Norway, Sweden and Denmark in our countries, it is often used for all of the Nordic countries elsewhere
You would be surprised to see how little we actually drink compared to other countries, even though it's ingrained in our culture, the normal consumption is just starting to return (i.e not getting shitfaced only on weekends), and at that we are worse than the brits but still pretty bad
An linguistics expert once said that if we found a Norwegian Viking in a glacier and was able to get him back to life, the closest to understanding what he said would be to get an Icelandic person to speak to him
Because we spoke the same language 1000 years ago, then Norway was occupied by Swedes and Danes etc and our language changed
In Iceland they kept their language more intact because they are an island and better at preserving their language
And I as a Norwegian can not understand what an Icelandic person speak today
True, although an Icelandic person would have trouble with speaking to someone
It's only the written form and grammar that is similar
And the language did not change *because* we were occupied the language here changed
It did anyway due to our own developments
Some dialects seem to have changed "hestarnir" to "hestannje" already by 1350
Norwegians could've understood speaking back to around 1400 or so (sounds like a weird dialect) but the spelling pre-1500 would be too Old Norse and incomprehensible
Pre-1350 Old Norse would be much too foreign
Norwegian today, at least bokmål, is a modified version of Danish, and I as a norwegian, can not understand a Danish person either
Most of the evolution in Scandinavia is due to internal sound changes, not German influence
Which makes sense since you mostly only have the sound changes you start yourself on the island
While dialects like mine in Norway have our own, in addition to some that might start in Western Norway and spread here, another that might start in Northern Sweden and spread here, and one starting in Western Sweden before spreading here
Just more potential for changes to arrise and spread
Danish
Pfftthh
The Danish got a collective potato stuck in their throats hundreds of years ago and none of us can understand them anymore
If they get that potato out, they might be still speaking Icelandic or Norwegian
Who knows
Getting the traditional bashing of other Scandinavian countries out of the way: That was a really interesting anecdote
Since climate change is melting ice everywhere, stay alert in case we do actually bring a viking frozen in a glacier back to life, please
...and by the way - I don't mean to offend you (in case I am horribly wrong) - but is your user name "Midweek days" in English
Because that is what it looks like with a bit of imagination in Norwegian, all tho we would spell it as "Midtukedager".
If it is, it is a good example of how the same language developes into different languages over the centuries :)
I know there are Icelandic dialects that did not do the  Bjarni > Bjartni/Bjatni thing, so those would be a candidate
As well as they who didn't change hv > kv
Besides that I think the whole island is kinda uniform in those other aspects
In fact south-western Norway have the same á > au and ll > dl/dd as well
I'm from the west coast of Norway and some dialect words are similar to Icelandic
But your letters that we (no longer) use makes them harder to recognise
Not really a calque, but Norwegian doesn’t have the rounded w-sound English has, and some people overuse it a lot in English
They’ll say «TW», «Wiolin» and «wictory».
Learn instead of teach
"I will learn you to play chess". Norwegian uses the same word for both
It sounds like baby-talk, yes
Actually, we don't have English's v-sound either
The Norwegian <v> is in between /w/ and /v/ phonetically
It is a *[voiced labiodental approximant] (IPA: ʋ)
So, in English, we tend to mispronounce both sounds
I was in Denmark for a music festival
We'd been there two weeks already and I was tired, and couldn't be bothered to try to understand danish at the moment so I switched to English with the guy selling beer
We small talked a bit and he asks where I'm from
Turns out we were from the same small city in Norway
At the moment we don't have any national ID card, apart from the normal passports
However, making one has been a plan since 2007, postponed a number of times it seems to be on the road to releasing, along with new passports in fall this year
[Here] is a draft of how it will look
Is it just me or it won't have *personnummer*?
Long time ago I could use my bank card as ID, but the last one with a photo on it was probably at least 15 years ago
Driving license usually works though
Edit: who calls us ["Norga"] I wonder
> who calls us "Norga" I wonder
Are you trolling or genuinely wondering
Bokmål first followed by Nynorsk
Some of the designations has the same spelling so only one is used
I'm guessing he's genuinely wondering, as while I'm sure it's Sami, it's not a language you encounter at all unless you're in the north
I actually have no idea
I only know about Norra (Estonian), Noruega, Norway, Norge and Noreg
The languages are Bokmål, Nynorsk, Northern Sami and English
Wouldn't it be Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo
If we remove sweden and denmark it would be Bergen or Christiania/Oslo through most of that time period
Well yes but adding the largest City in current day norway during those years makes sense
First grade of primary school when you are 6, then you have to have it for 11 years
YouTube is who I dedicate my skills to as watching videos with no subtitles really helped my understanding of the language
South Park
Lots of South Park
I began at 10 years old
I had classes until I was 18
When I was 23 I started watching movies on DVD with English subtitles instead of Norwegian which is my mother tongue
I also had a friend living in London at the time and visited him several times and got to practise when I was there
Now I use Reddit and I still watch series and movies with English subtitles if I’m watching alone
Edit: And I have a British neighbour at the moment, that helps me practice my small talk skills
I started learning English at the age of 6, just like every other Norwegian first grader did after the 1997 reform
I’d already been exposed to a lot of English, mostly in the form of music but also some movies
Living in Spain helped me improve a lot, as I didn’t know any Spanish when I moved there
Not everyone in Spain speaks English, but I had to use it more than I would have if I stayed in Norway all my life
Not only speaking and understanding spoken English, but casual everyday reading too, like menus at restaurants and such
I’ve always loved to read and since it was difficult to get a hold of books in Norwegian in Spain I had to read in English (e-books weren’t really a huge thing back then, and also e-books suck)
I’d say that I’ve been mostly fluent in English since I was 13/14 ish
My Spanish is still shit though
You start English classes during your first school year in Norway (when you’re 5-6yrs) and continue until your first year of high school
So for the younger generation, you start learning it at a very young age, and with the growing presence of video games, mostly in English, many learn quite a bit through video games as well
At least I certainly did when I was younger
Began learning it in school in 4th grade
Nowadays however kids start learning it in 1st grade, and by the time they become teenagers they mix a lot of English words into their Norwegian
(Due to gaming, movies
In Norway we start at 3rd or 4th grade in elementary school learning English
So around 9-10 years old I guess
I've always liked English so I've learned a lot by reading and listening to music
It also helped a lot that I was making English comics at like 12-13 years old
I'm a lot online and have made some friends that I have to speak/write English with
Now I'm studying something that is taught in English and also has some international students so I have to talk English to them, so I'm happily improving speaking English too
I knew a few english words from kindergarten, but I started learning english in 1st grade (6 years old)
I improved my reading in school and my spoken english through movies, TV and youtube
when i found minecraft YouTubers at the age of 6
Very early
I spoke English almost fluently by the time i was 10-11
It's probably because i grew up watching english speaking movies and tv shows
I remember watching shows like 7th heaven, Home And Away and macgyver every day after school
I also grew up going on vacations to Greece, Turkey, Spain and the UK
That helped me practise speaking English
My grammar isn't as good as my English speaking though
In Norway, learning english at school starts at age 6
I probably learned some english during kindergarten, and then in school, all the way from 6 to 15 year old and up
I remember a point where i wrote "fuck you bich" on IRC and someone told me i should learn proper english before trying to insult someone in english
After that i got my shit together and started learning english better so i could insult people without being told my english suck
Also, using irc and Linux since the age of 13-14 really forced me to learn pronounciation, and how to formulate questions properly
This i think is the main source of my english skills
Watched movies and tv-series that are not dubbed, communicated with english speakers, read english books
I think my generation started of with cat, dog, etc
in our second year of elementary, when we were 7-8 years old
20 years have gone by since I started to learn english, and a lot has changed, from being a kid that went online for the first time, to reading and hearing english every day
I don’t really need subtitles when watching English-speaking movies, but I’m kinda insecure, so I’m afraid I’ll miss out on something if I don’t have them
I have quiet a few English books in my shelf
In first grade (age 6), but I wasn't fluent in English until I was 8 or 9
I improved by watching TV-series and movies, also by reading English on the internet
It's a bit of a special case, but I grew up in the Middle East, up until I was 11 years old, with a Norwegian father and a French Canadian mother, and also an Indian housemaid
So I grew up learning to speak all three languages from the start
I have distinct memories of having English classes in 1st grade, so I was like 5-6
I was quite lucky as a child because one of my best friends was American living in Norway
She spoke Norwegian, but she also taught me a lot of English, introduced me to music and movies that I probably wouldn’t have been aware of if I didn’t know her
After she moved back to the US, I was always interested in English and took it very seriously in school
As a teenager I started reading a lot of English books and obviously spent time of the internet (YouTube, Tumblr and Twitter)
I think we started in 3rd grade, at age 9
When did you go to school
These days Norwegian kids learn English in school starting in 1st grade
Weird, we also started with English classes in 1st grade (2006 in my case)
Im 23 now so it doesn't surprise that they've started earlier now, it's a good thing in my opinion
Thinking if they for example go on vacation somewhere and maybe accidentally get lost and have to ask for help
I was 9 in 2006, but I can't remember any English education before that
I started 2008 and also started English in first grade
I'm 26 and I have distinct memories of English class in 1st grade, but maybe it was more up to the school back then
Since Kunnskapsløftet (2006) we have had goals for English after year 2
I find that kids these days pick up a lot of English from the media (Youtube, TikTok, gaming) and sometimes they're actually better at English than their teachers, lol
(I'm a teacher)
Maybe it differed around the country
We didn't learn that much obviously, it was extremely basic, but we learned things like names of fruits and colors
Yeah
Internet and stuff is a lot more accessible for kids now than it was for us when we were younger, so I get they can pick up a lot of stuff from there with those things you mentioned (I almost forgot about those lol)
I started school in 2008
Totally
It's funny, I work with a lot of kids with autism and for some reason a lot of them actually speak more English than Norwegian
With good reason - A lot of them consume a lot of music and riddles on Youtube that obviously are in English
Broadly
I can usually pick a Scandinavian, or a Southern European, Slavs, English etc
It can be a bit more difficult smack bang in the middle of western Europe, but mannerisms, dress, eyes/hair/skin can hint at nationality
The Dutch are often easy to spot
They're a lot blonder than I would have expected
Tall too
Germans have a certaind
Mannerism
Scandinavians have big heads/faces with high cheekbones
Spaniards look different to the Greeks, too
But I can't tell you exactly what sets Europeans apart in appearance, apart from the obvious
I guess you start to recognise patterns in features and mannerisms
I'm also pretty good at telling Asians apart too
I can struggle a bit with differentiating between Thai/Vietnamese, but I can pick an Indonesian no worries
Chinese and Japanese look quite different, but I can be tripped up by Koreans, but I do have an idea of what features to looks for there
Someone should make a website or something with pictures of people and you guess their country
Would be interesting to see the results
Sometimes, but it can be tricky
A guy from Spain working in my children's school looks like he is from the middle east
A Norwegian friend looks French
My South African husband is mistaken for Norwegian all the time, until he starts speaking
(His forefathers came from Germany, Netherlands and France
Plus one person who was traced back to Denmark)
Not by facial features, but it's quite easy to tell from haircut and dress
Eastern european men quite often have a buzz cut hair style
Poles, Baltic people or Russians  will be easily recognized by their track suits
Hungarians, Bulgarians or Romanians have the same hair cut, but often substitute the track suit with camo pants, while people from the balkans all have black leather jackets (this also goes for the southeast europeans)
Eastern european women will often dress a bit too provocative for my taste
You'll often see them wear high heels even in mid-winter
Furs or leather are a definitive sign
French people dress distinctly different from anybody else
Light colours, light materials, elegantly dressed
Spanish and Italians also dress in light fabrics, but are way more coloured than the French
The germans are a different sort
I think they're getting better at it year by year, and they've come far from the socks-in-sandal stereotype
But they're still easily spottable with their dark coloured fabrics and practical clothes
Hair is always a bit too long
They will inevitably have an all weather jacket
Ducth people are a bit difficult to tell
Probably because they look too similar to us Scandinavians
And then there's the british
I can't put my finger on exactly what it is, but they,'re just a tad bit tackier than the rest of Europe
I Can tell Scandinavians, British and Portuguese/Spanish(can tell if they are either Spanish or Portuguese, but cannot tell if they are Portuguese or Spanish) apart most of the time
The French and Italians I typically mix up
I can tell who is British most of the time
And I mix up most Eastern European people
(mostly northeast Europeans) South east(Greece, Croatia, Turkey etc) I can not tell apart
It depends, I can recognize Scandinavians easily and is usually correct
My stepdad has studied the face shape,  headshape, traits (?? like eye shape, nose) etc
of different nationalities/regions so I've learnt some of that too
It's easy to see if someone is from eastern Europe but I'm not good at specifically where
Tbh I find it easier to guess the nationality of people from Asia/SE Asia lol
It was probably the sitting alone in a corner that gave him away
My first thought too
(Maybe it's more difficult when you have the same accent
Their beauty
Recycle ALL aluminium
Reusage of aluminium requires much less energy than the production of new aluminium
The obvious ones:
Bring a reusable bottle everywhere for coffee and water etc
But non-package food like fruits and vegetables and bring your own package for it
Bring your own bags everywhere
Only accept basgs when absolutely necessary
Buy used
Wether it’s clothing or appliances, almost anything can be bought used
And for what you cannot buy used, look for more sustainable ingredients
Like bamboo toothbrush or underwear
The more cotton the better
100% cotton is the best
Never use one-use products unless absolutely necessary
I don’t know your gender, but if you’re a girl consider period-cup
I have never used one but it supposedly also reduces your money spent as you only need 1
Public transport, let your car stay when you don’t actually need it
Don’t fly as much
That’s about all I can think of
And remember don’t strive for perfection
Any effort is better than none
Don't buy new clothes if you don't need them, especially cotton
The clothing industry is one of the biggest polluters out there
- Owls in the moss (Ugler i mosen) = something seems suspicious
- As herring in a barrel (som sild i tønne) = people gathered tightly in a small area
- To meet the wall (å møte veggen) = to be exhausted / burned out
- To get iron curtain (å få jernteppe) = to completely forget what you wanted to say
- Take it completely piano (ta det helt piano) = To take it easy
- Cat in a bag (Katta i sekken) = when you didn't get (bought) what you expected (for instance when you bought a car that turned out to be in a much worse conditions than you expected)
Edit: spelling
We have an idiom that is weird because we misheard the danish
In Norway we have "owls in the moss" It means that something suspicious is happening
But it was supposed to be wolves in the swamp
Sry danes, we norwegians love to mishear ur idioms
"stå med skjegget i postkassa" - literally "to stand with your beard stuck in the mailbox"
Used for saying that you messed up and now you have to deal with the consequences kinda
Like "you could buy the wrong car, and then you'll stand there with your beard in the mailbox"
Also to do someone a "bear favour" (bjørnetjeneste)
It's when you do someone a favour, but it backfires and ends up giving them more grief than help
We also have some from my region:
- Ta deg ei pera (Take a pear) = sort of a mikstur between get lost and get over it
- Herlega London (Wonderful London) = When you are slightly resigned and just need to vent a bit
E. g. Have you seen the new Christmas decoration
Wonderful London, it's just a bit much
- Satt det håve på ei ku, då hadde ikkje melkå blitt gode (if that head was on a cow, then the milk would not have been good) = When somebody is stupid
«Å drite på leggen» (=to shit on the calf)
It means you’ve embarrased yourself big time
«Snakker om sola, så skinner den» (=speak of the sun and it will shine)
Similar to «Speak of the devil, and he shall appear»
Never take everything for good fish
I also have some:
Å sitte med skjegget i postkassa (sitting woth your beard in the mailbox) = to be stuck in a tricky situation
Gullhår i ræva (golden hair in your ass)= used when someone is very lucky
Ikkje selg skinnet før bjørnen æ skutt (don't sell the skin before the bear is shot)= Don't make a deal before you know it can be done
Those are the ones I can remember right now
(I'm fron Eastern Norway btw)
We have a corresponding one in Norwegian
"Fra asken til ilden" - From the ashes to the fire
Norwegian has "skyte spurv med kanoner" (shooting sparrows with cannons) for the same situations
Similar to ours
Don't make a feather into five hens
Bog is "myr" in Norwegian
We use the 'Ta deg ei pera' only that we use 'Bolle' instead
Ah, those are nice local ones
The last one I have actually never heard
When I was a child (west-coast), and my mum got angry, she used to say:
- "Det er nå hov på hesten om han er nå langt nede
" (The horse has a hoof (?), even if it's far down" = Now I am totally outraged
- "Hvis du ikke gjør som jeg sier blir det MÅNELYST
" (If you are not doing as you are told now the moon will start shining) = Well
then we knew it was time to do as we were told
We actually never dared to test beyond this point
(..and this one works well on my own children too by the way
) :)
> «Å drite på leggen» (=to shit on the calf)
That expression must originate from the time before everyone had outhouses (utedo)
That's a good one
West-Coast here as well, never heard the first one, but Månelyst is serious business
The last one of mine I had never heard until I visited my in laws (who are farmers) and a neighbor was visiting
The first one I believe comes from the north-west (nord-Møre
Språkrådet (the language council)
They are in the lucky position of maintaining two different written variants of the same language
They add new words as they are invented, and also makes an effort to translate English tech terms to Norwegian, with varying luck
Språkrådet is the official institute for any matter of the Norwegian language in both forms (bokmål and nynorsk)
They’re issuing thoughts on new words, imported words, names, tendencies, further development of the language and different dialects etc
They do also issue guidance for good use of Norwegian
We do also have at least two unofficial organisations concerning language questions, Riksmålsforbundet and Noregs Mållag
The first takes care of questions related to bokmål and more traditional Norwegian, while the latter takes care of anything related to nynorsk and dialects
They are particularly interest organisations which aim at ensuring a stable or plural language in Norway and that the language in its different forms and dialects persists
Noregs Mållag is today the most active of the two for that matter
Yeah, in that case you misunderstood
Several beaches in Lofoten looks breathtaking, just don't expect warm water
There's some pretty good pictures on [this site]
[Kvalvika beach]
All of our beaches will kill you
(Iceland)
norway isn’t exactly know for its beaches but along the oslofjord the beaches are really good, there’s a few islands outside the cities of tønsberg and sandefjord that’s super nice
It should be mentioned that the longest beaches are probably found south of Stavanger, from Sola down to Brusand
Several decent sand beaches
Definitely not as pretty as the Lofoten ones though
And the North Sea isn't exactly known for its tropical water temperatures
Yeah good point
That looked pretty epic, hope you manage to get up there one day
Kaizers Orchestra, definitely
They played a folk/indie-rock in the Jærsk dialect, and they have a bunch of really catchy tracks: my favourite songs from them are Resistansen, Stormfull Waltz and 170
[Norwegian Reggaeton]
It is from an Italian band, so not Norway, but they sing about Black Metal and Scandinavian culture
Also most lyrics are in Spanish with a few English verses, and the memes and jokes are so well layered
Add to this the fact that the song is catchy as hell and packs a punch, and you have the most hilarious summer hit ever
Böse Onkels too, right
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl
Bodø vs Tromsø on what city is the best in northern Norway (Spoiler: it's Bodø)
I hear that in Ajax vs Feyenoord matches they have walls between each club's supporters
And that one of the groups perform some quite racist gestures towards the others
No Tromsø is the better city
Tromsø is definitely better
Bodø beats us only in football, trains and wind
I would also say that the rivalry between the north and the south of Norway always has been huge
A lot of stadiums have designated away fans sections with fences around the travelling fans
Also the universities, Nord universities administration in Vesterålen suuuuucks, i quit and started all over again through UiT
I know many that did the exact same thing, mostly felt like we weren’t taken seriously as students, especially when covid hit
The dialects I remember from Nemo is that the sharks talk Bergensk, as many cartoon villains did
At least it seems like they've moved away from the trope in recent years
Don't a lot of villains also have a bit of a Sunnmøre-dialect as well
Also rural rednecks tend to get dubbed with inland dialects like Hedmark and Oppland
Bergensk and Scanian both have the gutteral R in common
If you're good at it, you can pinpoint almost exactly where someone is from by listening to their dialect
Drive through Norway and you'll get a new dialect every 30 minutes, and unlike a lot of other countries we tend to keep our dialects no matter what setting, education, work etc we have
With modern media our vocabulary has gotten more uniform across the country, but pronunciation can still vary quite a bit
I don't know this for sure, but I have heard something about Norway having the most different dialects in the world or something
They are very different in the different regions of the country and we also have the same thing where ever village and town have their own variations
In Norway the dialect (at least in the west) changes at almost every town, city and island
Yep
Norway too
We sound wildly different, even from town to town
Yes
If I drive one hour away from where I live people will talk differently
We do
I could travel fifteen minutes and end up somewhere with a different dialect to mine
We have some major dialects for every county, and then every commune and town has their own variations and words
Yes
I = jeg, eg, æ, æg, i, ei, e..
Edit: forgot a couple: jæ, jæi, jej, ek
If you’re bad at it, you might struggle understanding people
Especially from the more secluded areas who’ve not been influenced as much by the big “oslo-dialect”
Same with Norway vs Sweden with regards to few people with many dialects vs many people with few dialects
The deciding factor seems to be the mountains
Same in Norway, probably the mountains are to blame
That's a bit of a myth, it's impossible to count
It's more that we use the dialects more than many others and they are more visible
Never heard of ek before
Where do they say that
True
I'm more of a mix of multiple, but my dialect is mostly ytre sogn
But a bunch of people throughout my life have asked my if I'm from Bergen based on it
Certain people from the Stavanger area
Now try watching this:
same, and i’m norwegian
i live here now and the first week was like moving to another country
I'm from Stavanger
I've never heard anyone say ek
Doesn't make much sense considering we usually pronounce k's as g's, so "ek" would be the opposite of the norm
Well, to an outsider it can definitely sound like "Ek" at times
Oh wow interesting to see
During the time the vikings where a bit mean to the UK, they must have influenced some words
Of course what they spoke is not what Norwegian is today, but both Foss and Skrike is Norwegian words meaning Waterfall and Scream
It's called "standard østnorsk", and it's just a generic Oslo area dialect
The brown rat also known as the "norwegian rat", *rattus norvegicus* in Latin, has nothing to do with Norway
Its origin is most likely somewhere around the Caspian sea
Drinking age is 20 in Denmark
TIL
The opinions of people who are so incredibly uninformed are already worthless
Less than one percent of people believe concentration camps were Polish, and the other 99 percents know those people are clueless idiots
Norsk or Norwegian we basically learn how to write and speak Norwegian but I guess this was pretty obvious
I would be very surprised if there are schools in Europe which don't teach about different religions
We also have that in Norway but it’s just about food, I think it included more stuff before but was mostly just for the girls now it is for everyone
Why is revolution history seperate from history in general
We don’t have sløyd as a individual subject but it is includes in arts and crafts
We can also choose our own subject from 8-10 grade
We had it as a seperate subject in "barneskolen" but it became a part of arts and crafts later
Yes thats true we learn the other writing form and I don’t know of any other countries that have multiple writing forms in one language
I’ve been there
Beautiful city
There aren't any here as far as I know
The reason might be that historically norway (and sweden) fought on the sea and attacked coast cities
So they didnt have any use for the mainland territories
I wouldnt go as far to say mainland territories were useless everywhere but they were in norway and sweden at that period
Norwegian, Danish, English 100%
Kind of surprised by only understanding maybe 96% Swedish, but damn you have some strange words
I was able to understand the context in German, sometimes even full sentences
I understood some Dutch and Afrikaans, but not enough to get the context, and only rarely full sentences
Same with Icelandic
Low German and Bavarian were the hardest
tried dutch, icelandic and afrikaans
strangely enough i could basically understand everything in afrikaans
i could understand most of the icelandic stuff but the different letterings made it hard and dutch was the hardest
Basically everything
Understand only the 3 on top
+ English
I understand basically all of Swedish and Danish, I get the German, and I get the general fist of Flemish, but not much
I can understand 100% of the Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and English articles, around 50% of the sentences in the German and Icelandic articles, and only a few words in the others
I can undestand most Germanic languas better than they understand Norwegian
I find it weird that you understand Danish better than Norwegian
Norwegian and swedish is well understood by both sides verbally
But the written language is a bit different
Norwegian and Danish is fairly hard to understand by both sides verbally, but the written language is just about identical
Really
Danish and Norwegian spelling is almost identical
Only pajamas
Yeah baggy sweatpants
I do wear sweatpants outside but it's mostly the slimmer ones that look a bit more presentable
I have a pair of baggy grey sweatpants that I would only wear at home
I have a Minecraft tee that's not seen sunlight since I bought it eight or so years ago
I'm wearing it rn
Not because they're not nice, they're bought specifically to be worn at home
Clothes that exist only for comfort and can be ugly as sin
Yes definitely
Nice enough so I can open the door if someone rings the doorbell, but still comfy
Absolutely
Every day, first thing I do when I get back to my flat is undress and throw on a pair of sweatpants and an old Hard Rock Café tee
No need to look good if I'll just be cleaning or lounging
My one piece that's wayyy too big, and my make-shift sith costume
Nah, I wear nice jeans, hoodies, sweaters, shirts and the like at home as well
The same as outside
I hate sweatpants and ugly t-shirts, and I hate feeling and looking sloppy— even at home
So I try to wear and look my best when outside and even at home
It’s also much more comfortable for me that way, and that makes up for it that I feel much better about myself
Fine clothes can be comfortable as well
There's a children's song from the 50s called "Vesle Hoa". It's about a black boy saving his tribe
Has the n-nord and everything
It's overall very problematic
[Maybe this one as well]
most neighbors have some beef i think, like russian and ukraine/finland, norway and denmark/sweden, austrian and it’s former empire, germany and poland etc
sometimes it’s more light hearted and not as serious but sometimes it can be a genuine anger towards each other
I play lots, and I mean lots of hoi4 and I have prob only played Norway twice
Boring ass country
I play every single nation although I like Italy and Germany because I can take over Europe
Mare Vôtrum
Longest city/town name I could think of is Stjørdalshalsen
Not particulary long
We do however have a very short one, [Å.]
The longest Norwegian place-name I could find is Kvernbergsunds-Ødegaarden
It's not a city/town name though
The shortest name of a village in Norway: Å. (Pronounced as the O in John)
We have Å as well so it's a tie
Yeah, I know it's strange
How would you intuitively pronounce it
Yes, that's an even better description
The circle avobove the A makes all the difference
We can also entertain you with such letters as Ø (as in noef) and Æ (as in bad)
I don't take offense
It's probably just as hard for a french to pronounce Norwegian as it is for a Norwegian for pronounce French
Probably even harder, as we probably observe more of your culture, eat your food, learn it in school, travel there, watch Tour de France etc which makes us learn at least SOME
But your grammatic, that's just messed up, monesieur
Pardon, mademoiselle
The Tour de France is HUGE outside France too
I'm watching every stage from start to finish after work, my TV system let's me watch things that has already  been on TV
Sometimes this makes me sit up late into the night, but I enjoy it
This year a Norwegian even won stage 1 and went into the maillot jaune
We've had 5 guys winning stages: Dag Otto Lauritzen won on Bastille Day 1987, Thor Hushovd won a lot in the 2000-2010's, Kurt Asle Arvesen won one stage, Edvald Boasson Hagen has won 3 stages (I think) so far, Alex Kristoff has won 4 so far
I can go on and on about the subject
Honestly I don't remember the latest French winner
There has been 3  British winners: Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome (technically he's Kenyan), and Geraint Thomas (All from Team Sky)
Edit; Last French winner was in 1985, Bernard Hinault
I hope to go to St
Petersburg
I’ve dreamt about it all my life
Probably won’t come true this year, but it would be nice to go when everything is up and running and my wallet is a little thicker
London
I had a trip booked for this June and I had to cancel
I really wanted to get a trip in before Brexit went through
I probably won't be properly traveling for a good while, but I'm moving home to my dad in a couple weeks, as I'm almost finished with my degree, and there are absolutely no jobs at the moment so I can't pay for an apartment
I might continue on a Masters degree in the fall, and I'll have to move out again, but who knows if I get accepted
Other than that I'm really overdue for a visit of my mom's side of the family in Canada
It's been four years since the last time I've seen them
Hopefully I can do it next Christmas
Do you mean Stavanger
Stavern is a tiny town on the south eastern coast
Definitely a nice place to visit, but it's no city
Trust me, if I'm able to travel in October (half term for schools) I will be going to London
\*Clarity
I know
Stroopwafels are so much better than donuts
Any reason to visit Stavern is as good as any other
It's a pretty little town
Fair points
I have actually yet to taste real stroopwafels
I have only tasted a store bought variant my friend used to bring while we studied at uni
I just love everything pancake like
Really looking forward to visiting the Netherlands one day and eating real ones
No, but they are waffel/pancake like in terms of ingredients
In Norway at least, Waffels are very like pancakes
Only fried in different types of irons
The Belgian Waffel is clearly different
And the biscuit in a cone ice cream is called Vaffelkjeks (Waffel biscuit) and is just a dreid variant of the vaffel
Added the last part after I had written the initial comment, but you probably didn't see it
Waffels can be both soft and crunchy, just depends on how you make them
I agree that the syrop filled middle differs though
I understand your point of view
I have tried to make them at home, eaten the store-bought and Googled them (I am really looking forward to tasting the real deal)
Most likely, we just have a different definition about what Waffels are
However, when I eventually taste them, if I realize I was wrong, I will find this comment and send you a PM admitting I was wrong and you were right :)
Do you recommend any special place to buy them if I travel to Amsterdam
These are the store bought I have tasted:
An American one, from Texas
My neighbour had his car shipped over here
He had lived and worked in Texas for 5 years and just moved back
He's got Norwegian plates now though
Wait
Swedes also say "Helt Texas"? Cool
I dont really know the cost
However this guy did know someone and they did it pretty cheap for him
Something about them already transporting stuff, and they had room for the car so why not
It's an expensive car, but definitely not impossible to get
It's a Porsche (don't know the model) and I've seen that exact Porsche at the dealership that's 10 minutes down the road
If it is a new car, you have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in import tax, but it is not necessarily "expensive" locally in Norway - since if you want to drive that car in Norway all other similar cars also have the same taxes added to the purchasing price
But it is expensive with US eyes - US market prices
An extreme example: There is a 2020 Ford F-150 Shelby SuperSnake pickup truck with no miles for sale in Norway right now (a big truck with a huge engine is basically the worst you can buy in Norway tax wise)
It costs $220,000 if you take out the back seats and register it as a 2 seater working truck
With the backrow of seats in the crewcab, as a 5 seater, that truck costs $290,000
Compared to the US those prices are wild, but if you live in a society where that is the price, only a handful of people would consider buying it and some rich person will
Because he or she will have pretty much the only or one of a few cars like that in Norway
And when you sell it, you can sell it for much more than US msrp
The only thing you can't do, is export it back to the US because then you lose the local market price of the car
And now you know why Norwegians buy Teslas that hardly have any import taxes :) They are relatively "cheap" since fossil fuel cars are so heavily taxed
(The F-150 example was just an extreme result of the tax system, other cars are not that heavily taxed)
Actually, last year they changed the veteran import tax rule
We now can import any car older than 20 years old relatively tax free
"Alfakrøll" or "krøllalfa" - alpha roll / roll alpha
When reading it can just be "at".
A more accurate translation is "alpha curl/curl alpha". But yeah, most people just say "at".
Says the kanelbulle country
I don't think most people say "at".
Perhaps not
I know they use the it in media, but other than that, I can't remember the last time someone said "krøllalfa" when giving their mail adress
It's either "at" or nothing in my experience
I do a lot of work in peoples houses, and when I am asking them for an email so I can send the invoice, they only use "krøllalfa" and sometimes "alfakrøll".
I usually cheer for Denmark/Russia/Sweden after Norway
New Zealand if they’re there
>Everyone hates Petter Northug
Get over him, Sweden
He retired last year
It's Klæbo that's beating you now :)
We never get into the world cup or european championship so I was cheering Iceland on in both 2016 and 2018
In football I'll find another nation out of pure necessity:
Norway
Iceland
Denmark (lived there)
Sweden
A random team that is fun to watch
We root for Denmark and Sweden also, but not in winter sports
Loosing is not an option, and loosing to Sweden is a national tragedy
You guys don´t even qualify as a challenge ;)
> Well, I can't say that I cheer for Sweden in hockey or other sports, but I'm not one of those pathetic bastards who cheer for their opponents either
I'm just neutral
Made me laugh
Thanks
> Russia
Why
Thanks
I’ve got some Russian friends
I was surprised by that too
Hey, They need some love too
Those are FUN
120km/t on snow, yes please
&#x200B;
My pappa used to dra me on rattkjelke behind his snøskuter to our former hytte when I was a barn, but ikke in 120km/t
Makes sense
Which is why I have a soft spot for Estonia and Poland
UK- How badly built English houses are- they're freezing, damp, and for some inexplicable reason sometimes have carpet in the bathroom
France- school on Saturday
Full sit down lunch at school with a starter (grapefruit), main (meat and veg) and dessert- and those lunch ladies were mean as fuck and would go around making sure we used our knives and forks properly etc
(if it's not blindingly obvious, I went to school there for a year)
Sweden (North)- how flat it is compared to Norway
How much the Northerners drink
How similar Estonians are to Nordic people
Much more so than Latvians or Russians who also are their neighbours (Estonia even has a large'ish Russian population
) Years of Soviet rule did not remove or change their Nordic'ness
this explains why I always feel so comfortable in Germany
A pub lady in the UK however called me "Love" once
Yes
I haven't lived in Romania, but travelled in Transylvania a bit
The food was amazing
[This photo comes to mind
When do you eat breakfast
I'm guessing farm life, which is again dictated by sunlight
We start work earlier, go home earlier, thus eat earlier
But here 'supper' is a staple (kveldsmat, literal translation evening food), so meals happen about 4 times a day
I've lived in about 6 different countries, and I think the warmer thr climate, the later you eat (roughly)
That also translates into longer periods of sunlight
> I'm used to dine somewhere between 8pm and 9pm
All my kids are in bed by 9
When to Portuguese children go to bed
>  other times I feel perplexed how many people are just unable to be dynamic about situations
Please give an example
Or two
Oh, I also a short three month stint in Ireland, and please tell me ladies--why do you wear so much makeup
And why is is bright orange
> UK- How badly built English houses are- they're freezing, damp, and for some inexplicable reason sometimes have carpet in the bathroom
I haven't lived in the UK myself, but all my Norwegian friends who have lived there (a good few
) said the same thing
They had mold in their houses, water damage, constant dampness, etc
Moving further north from Spain or Italy must be a huge shock food-wise, even to countries where cooking from scratch is more common than in the UK
British cuisine = a melting pot of historical Commonwealth and British Empire cuisine
> I felt like dying from hunger by the time they would be having their lunch
Same
I think your inner clock gets used to 11:00 somehow
> You put water in your coffee
What do you do
Chew on it dry
> UK- How badly built English houses are- they're freezing, damp, and for some inexplicable reason sometimes have carpet in the bathroom
I remember seeing some tv-show about council housing (a very interesting topic in it's self), and one apartment building had a build up of water on the ground outside (drainage didn't work properly)
and the water somehow travelled up the wall and caused a damp problem on the second floor
Very fascinating
I had no idea water can climb up brick buildings
That being said I have only visited people in the UK living in brand new building complexes where there were no damp problems
Nope
The whole fucking bathroom
It was a nightmare, as I liked taking baths
I shudder to think what was growing in there
I think the moisture is what makes it so cold
Once the damp gets into your bones, it's done
It's quite common in the Nordic countries
I think it actually comes from the old meal times when most people lived on a farm
It was common to have a small meal around 10 or 11, between the very early breakfast  at 6 AM and dinner at 1 PM
Nowadays, people have their lunch at that time instead
Work days start early here, and it is not uncommon to be at the office around 7
30 AM
Many people skip breakfast too, and start to get hungry around 10 or 11
It's quite common to have an office snack around 2 PM too, in order to keep it going till dinner around 5 or 6 PM
Getting to work early requires an early lunch, and allows us to head home at 3
30 PM while still putting a full work day
Oh, I wasn't aware of that
In Norway there is often an English alternative
My husband prefers to get his tax papers in English for instance
Yup
To add to this: the Norwegian word for dinner is "middag", which literally means "the middle of the day". Half the year we have very little sunlight, I'd guess that's a factor
The traditional meals during summer are:
* Åbit - a small snack at 6 AM before the work started
* Frokost - Breakfast, taken around 8
30 AM
* Dugurd - A smaller meal, at around 11 AM
* Middag - A full meal, around noon or 1 PM
* Nons -  A small meal at around 3
30 PM
* Eftasverd - A cold meal between 5 PM and 6 PM
* Kvelds - A light snack before bedtime
The high number of meals shows the amount of physical work that was done during summertime, when it's light from 6 AM till 11 PM
The meals varied in size, and gave rythm to the work day
In winter time, when there's sun only from 9 AM to 4 PM, substantially less food was eaten
People were doing less work and required fewer calories
In winter, people would eat:
* Duggurd at 11 AM
* Nons at 3 PM
* Kvelds before bedtime
Sometimes people would rise in the middle of the long night to have a meal as well
The winter meal times corresponds to the usual meal times in the Nordic countries today
What we used to called *middag* (dinner) is the equivalent of lunch in other countries, but it's simply not eaten at work places anymore
Instead we've renamed the *dugurd* meal as lunch and eat that as a light meal at 11 AM instead
To a great deal of confusion for visitors from other countries
EDIT: Formatting
Yep, I found an article saying 70% of Norwegians eat dinner between 4 and 6 PM on weekdays
Obviously people can have different schedules, and Norwegians are eating their dinners later and later as we're adopting more continental habits, but this holds true for my family at least
We start making dinner the moment we get home from work and eat a little over 5
(We have young kids, so we eat before they get too tired
I get to work early so I can get off work early and perhaps catch some sun in the afternoon during spring/fall
(In winter it's always dark when I get off work anyway, but in summer I also want to get off early to enjoy the summer day and drink beer etc
Scandinavia isn't the only place where it's pretty dark at times, but I think it's shaped a lot of our habits
> The traditional meals during summer are:
> Åbit - a small snack at 6 AM before the work started
> Frokost - Breakfast, taken around 8
30 AM
> Dugurd - A smaller meal, at around 11 AM
> Middag - A full meal, around noon or 1 PM
> Nons - A small meal at around 3
30 PM
> Eftasverd - A cold meal between 5 PM and 6 PM
> Kvelds - A light snack before bedtime
So we're sort of like Hobbits
Very interesting, I had heard of dugurd (duggurds where I'm from), but not åbit and nons
Sistnevnte, uttales det "nons" eller "nåns"?
That's correct
But it would probably be required in order to get enough calories to last through a long day of physical labour
Nåns med lang vokal
Many of them was cold meals with bread or lefse with something aside, reducing the need for work
This also meant that they could be eaten in the fields
(sort of what we still do when we bring a packed lunch of sandwiches to work, quite common here)
These meal times were common at farms and crofts before industrialization
Large farms would hire a lot of farm hands during the summer, and it was custom to provide food as well as boarding
The food was cooked by the farmer's wife
On large farms there would be kitchen maids and scullery maids who assisted
I don't feel anything about it
If it works for them then it is fine by me
The only one I've ever visited is Monaco, and what even is the point
What separates them from the french, or even the italians
Sure, tax exemptions and casinos and all that, but still
San Marino and Andorra are lagre enough to house their own cultures, and the vatican is a special place to put it mildly
But the most confusing one is Liechtenstein
Why are they separate from their neighbours
Liechtensteiners are a german people AFAIK, so why are they not part of either of the three nearby countries
I know my confusions are heavily stained with ignorance, but I honestly don't know/understand
Kudos to them for remaining autonomous
But they're all filthy rich aren't they
For some at least that's because they're tax havens
That's kind of shitty
To survive as a microstate is cool, to live as a parasite is decidedly uncool
I often forget them and they are very unimportant in the modern world, and it’s weird that they still exist after two world wars
I understand why the Vatican exists, it’s the most important microstate
But do we even need San Marino, Andorra, Lichenstein, Luxembourg and Monaco
But I have nothing against their existence, is just that I don’t care about them
But they are still cool and in a way nice historic monuments
It’s not corruption
It’s your ticket to heaven
Good
I hope you're doing well though
Iran has no interest of going to war, at worst they will attack some targets in Saudi Arabia
Reading the thread on r/worldnews and seeing everyone talk about WW3 just made me realise how little the average reddit user knows about politics
Sure, this does add fuel to the fire, but this is already a proxy war, and will not escalate to full blown conflict
Just another proof of that Europe need to be stronger together
The way the US acts around the globe with their wars, bombings, criminality, torture, molesting and prisoning, even with a history of shooting down passenger planes, can’t be backed and supported
The biggest losers in this game are the civilians in the poor countries they invade on various reasons and creates chaos and hell on Earth
I’m very surprised that European countries and others around the world aren’t taking more distance to these actions and talking about it
If it was say China or Russia it would be a lot of drama, initiatives to talks, condemning, boycotts, sanctions etc
But the US are always free to go on with what ever they do
The “peace” nation Norway with our brand new F35 fighters will always be prepared to help
I'm thinking Iran is gonna respond to it somehow
I just hope that this doesn't turn into an all out war
I think most other NATO members and European countries are a bit more hesitant joining anything after Libya
Medical what what what
Add: Just another sign that Norway is in the pocket of USA, buying 80 or so of the freaking most advanced fighter jets you can get, while we have almost no coverage with ships in our navy anymore with one of the longest coastlines in the world
Sssssshhhh, keep it a secret, or r/geopolitics will become just like the default subs
Maybe it was, but it has raised the awareness nevertheless
Some actually, and we were pretty forward on EV technology before it boomed, if we had kept it going today we would’ve been much more represented, maybe we will come back to that one day
Most medicines here are produced in Italy, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria or Germany as far as I know
Our scientists are actually doing breakthroughs in cancer treatment and knowledge on regular basis
We’re also working on other technologies, medical experiments and science in general, especially with other experts and institutions from other countries, you just don’t see it necessarily
Also, in our country medicines and medical care is for everyone, regardless of income, occupation, insurance etc
We’re also doing other stuff and is often a central part as negotiators or pursuers for peace and cooperation around the globe (ever heard of the Nobel Peace Price
We haven’t actively invaded many countries to get rid of their leaders and fuck things up though, haven’t nuked much people either, nor have we torture camps and rough prisons around
but we take care of many people who flee from the countries you’re destroying, maybe you should take more part in cleaning up your own mess one day soon
How much are you doing to curb global emissions
Maybe they did, but it has raised the awareness never the less
Before we mention Iraq
We all did our parts in Libya, but some of us never learn, obviously
Russia
Russia
(So USA: please stay in north of Norway
Thank you)
Sweden because Norway was invaded more than once from Sweden
No one, our neighbours are pretty chill with us
Even Russia
Statistically: Sweden
In the present situation: Russia
Possibly : US (we have oil)
Russia
100% russia
We have a border to russia far up north and it is protected by the army 24/7
Russia is a scary mother fucker
We should be scared of you, then
Statistically speaking, it really shouldn't be Russia
It's probably one of the world's longest lasting peaceful borders, as since the treaty with Novgorod in 1326, there has never been any armed conflict between Novgorod/Russia and Norway (unless you count Quisling's WW2 government as Norway, which you don't)
May I ask why
Since you are rather far away from their border
It could be Sweden
Karl XII created for a short time havoc, before he made trouble in Norway
What do you have that the US wants
Norway has land that is more eastern (easternmore
) than Finland, so maybe we’re the bad guys
Maybe it will be something like Occupied, where Russia occupies us on behalf of the EU
Yeah, those crazy Finnmark people
Sweden
I think there is greater danger of China "invading" Europe by buying up a large portion of land and businesses, than it is for the US to invade
(Although I'm sure if they find a reason to do so they might think about it
Indeed
Couldn’t have put it better myself
> a child to take care of (Norway)
Kid moved out some time ago
Well, if you dare go against the badass reindeer army
Well you could fabricate a claim on eastern Finnmark, on account of the let's say "oppressed" finnish-ethnic kveeni minority
In the town I'm from, 3/4ths of the population have finnish surnames
You could roll in with your Sisus and declare mandatory saunas for everyone, I bet that would go over well with the locals
I'd like to say he owns an oil company, but unfortunately your take on it fits fairly well, too
Well the oppression of the kveeni community isn't fabricated
But whether that oppression warrants a claim on sovereign Norwegian soil by the Finnish state is another matter
Not really
We have certain bars or restaurants that take pride in serving "working class food" or "husmannskost" as we say in Norwegian at a reasonable price, they are few and far apart
Most places to eat are these modern coffe house type places or bakeries that sell overpriced sandwitches (which are mostly air: white bread/baguettes with very little filling inside)
It is slightly changing though, some Italians opened a shop down the street from work that has a stone oven and does pizzas, panini sandwitches and also bakes bread, prices are very fair
Many older restaurants that serve simple traditional everyday food, maybe especially in less urban areas or as roadside taverns
Closest I can think of is Buffe ( buffet) but that used to be more commen when I was a child
Some hotels and the Danish ferry still have it though
> The old name for them was mjölkbar
How interesting
Concept never reached Norway
As I’ve heard they used to be around before
Could be even if I've never heard about it
I guess their hay days were in the 50s and 60s and they died out after that
Maybe someone have one somewhere just for the sake of nostalgia
[Vamp - Tirna Noir] )
That's what comes to mind if I were to think of the most beautiful song in Norwegian
[Kaizer Orchestra - Hjerteknuser] is more upbeat and catchy
All the party afterski songs I guess
Or øystein sunde songs
"Sånn er'e bare” is a funny song that mocks politicans and how they promise but never keep them :’)
I think a lot of Sami rap is pretty damn good
It retained a bit of the 90s rap style I love
A bit unrelated but this one is fun:
Splitter pine by Dumdum Boys, Sur som rognebær by Hellbillies, Toyota’n til Magdi by Karpe Diem, couple more out there some good tunes
D.D.E. – Det går likar no
En solskinnsdag
Kaizers makes bangers all over
It was very popular here for a long time
I think I still know most of the lyrics
Also Kaizers Orchestra
I diden’t even know what afterski was untill recently :’) Is it a european  thing
I was thinking og Postgirobygget but I couldn’t remember the name of the song
Røta and finaste eg veit are also cracking tunes and urban twang as an instrumental is brilliant, nice that you’ve checked them out
Thats great :) Its typical party music here :)
Gygrid
One of many Norwegianified Harry Potter words and names
Hagrid speaks an aggregated eastern Norwegian labour-class dialect in the Norwegian translations
Which probably is the most accurate given his Northern dialect originally
I think a more farmery dialect would've been a better translation of the original, but the one they chose did do the trick to make him the least posh person at Hogwarts
It depends on the use
Jukselapp if it is not allowed or sometimes even when it is allowed
At the university they were just called Notatark which means Note sheet
We had lockers for 8th-10th graders, but that was it
Not sure about other schools
We did in high school, but most books were carried in a backpack, at least if we had homework (which we often did)
But this is 20 years ago, things might be different
Not in elementary school, at least where I went, I think we just put the books in a shelf with our name on it
Junior high and high school does though, although, its not code combination, but instead you have to buy a padlock yourself, either those with just keys or those with codes on them if you want the locker shelf to be locked
Younger kids only carry home the books they need for doing homework
The rest are left in the classroom
Not sure how older kids do it
When I was that age (many moons ago) I just left all the books at home that was not needed that day
We have two each: one for books and one for shoes, jackets and stuff like that
We only had in high school, nothing before that
I guess it just depends on which school you go to
I never had a locker in my 17 years of school/studies
I had lockers from 8th to 10th grade
And in high school but for protective gear
I have never had a locker at school
I used to think students in American high school movies were so cool with their lockers and their coded padlocks :)
We had our own shelves from 1st to 10th grade and then lockers at my high school, but I know it's different from school to school
Same here (18 years)
Although I could access lockers in Uni, but they were few and always taken before I could get to them
I put my steel frame, leather made backpack on the scales when I was like
It was 5 kg
And that was just the books and stuff I needed that particular day for homework
The rest was stored in a shelf in our designated classroom
Here a 9 year old only carries the books they need to do homework
All the other books are left at school
(In shelves in the classroom)
(edit: spelling)
How does "bilione" cause problems
I’m just guessing here, but maybe it’s due to risk of confusion with English billion
According to SAS; absolutely nothing
Lack of (real) poverty
I quess beutiful nature and fjords, also probably oil
Despite being the 60th something largest country in the world, we have the second longest coastal line according to at least one list
Fjords and our awesomeness
Fish, oil and doing really good in winter games
The best in everything
Except football
Le meilleur pays quoi
The fact that we have so many dialects it’s impossible to count them all
And home of the Cyreilic alphabet
A company called Scandinavian Airlines, or SAS, made a commercial claiming that all Scandinavian culture is stolen, and that "absolutely nothing" is actually Scandinavian
[Here] is a link to said commercial
Yes, we all run our societies using the same model
Oh yeah, I think the controversy is a little overblown
The ad is more funny than anything, at least to me
I just cannot understand how they gave it the go-ahead
Its not in Norway, but I usally say have a nice day to the bus driver when I enter the bus :)
In the city, not at all
On the countryside however it's polite of say good morning, thank you
Yes, but not in the cities
When I lived more rural, I knew all the drivers and we said hey and bye and chatted a bit
Where I live now, half the time the bus drivers won't even look your way when you enter the bus
There's that occasional enthusiastic driver who says hi to everyone with great passion, but those either quit quickly or become like everyone else lol
With some exceptions
> In the city, not at all
Do not say thank you to Oslo bus drivers
You'll scare them
Technically it isn't allowed here either
But it is accepted to leave in front if nobody is coming on, or of course if the bus is too packed to leave the other end
Sadly not all people do, but to be fair its a bit difficult if its rush houer  :) and not all bussdrivers are like the classic bussdriver song :’)
I know
Did it once
Will never repeat
A buss driver, A buss driver, he is a man with good temper/mood
And if he have bad temper, then he is not a A buss driver, A buss driver is a man with good temper/mood
The driver is probably busy anyway, but Its important to try to make their day a little better :) imagne alk the kids and karens they deal with during a day
[Don't understand why it's not an eternal worldwide hit
I dos :) En bussjåfør, En bussjåfør, det er en mann med godt humør! Og har han ikke godt humør, så er han ingen bussjåfør! En bussjåfør, En bussjåfør, det er en mann med godt humør!
Kids nr 1 fav to drive the buss driver crazy on a schooltrip :’)
Yes, sometimes its difficult
The worst is if the bus is really late in winter
Its a very har job
A very thankless job too
I have met some shitty busdrivers that was very rude etc
But sadly the kind and nice onrs get ignored, cussed at or just have to deal with difficult people constantly
And they have almost no breaks even to pee
There have been times when desperate bus drivers have asked us if they could please go pee really fast
They should get more praise and respect
Its a song we can all sing together XD
Yes, poor poor drivers XD
Thats cool
Norwegian is a germanic language if im not wrong :)
China is a superpower
If we want their money, we have to accept their rules
That's how it is
The EU is often mocked for sending "strongly worded letters", well the gaming community will probably only send a few strongly worded tweets
Then everything will be forgotten
The huge backlash isn't going to actually be huge
Chinas willingness use their power however, that is huge
Blizzard can suck authoritarian chode for money all it wants, and people will let them get away with it - either by not knowing and/or not caring
Whatever miniscule backlash this has is not going to be felt fiscally, and therefore it's completely irrelevant to them
Personally I've never been particularly into anything Blizzard has ever done, but if there were an upcoming Blizz title I actually wanted I would probably be rethinking it
Norway is shaped like a sperm cell
Make of that what you want
I will also never forget that time someone accused Norway by saying that the only reason we wouldn’t join the EU is to make Sweden and Finland look like a flaccid dick on the [2 euro coin]
Make of that what you want as well
I just really like the way Austria and France looks
Austria's got this real cool shape, I don't know why France looks good it just does
Gotta give it to the Czech people and their tasty borders
I have always thought Germany looks like a head from the side, where Berlin is an eye and its mouth is wide open ready to eat Czechia
No particular reason at all
Brick Portugal
I really don't see how Sweden and Norway makes one
I am neutral on this matter
I believe, Turkey and Kurdistan shouldn't be countries at all
They could be one country, kind of like what should've happened in Korea
Of course if I was a citizen of these two countries, I would say otherwise, but right now, that's my mentality
That's not what he is saying
I agree that the Kurds deserve their own country, but it's not going to happen
No country is going to willingly give away their own territory
For the major players in the region, status quo is the desired outcome
Yes
Haven't been mistaken up till now when it comes to adults
Someone moving to a country as a young child is usually the only ones able to adopt the correct accent
I can basically always tell if someone is a native English speaker or not, and often I can tell where they're from (at least roughly)
We're exposed to so much native English in pop culture like music, movies and TV shows that it's obvious when someone isn't native
Yes
This is SO annoying to me
And confusing of and have, like in could have/should have
I learned English when I was 10
I don´t really remember what it sounded like to me then, but now it sounds soft in a «mumbly»
way, because of sounds that does not exist in Norwegian
Like «th», «w» «r» and maybe «j». We have an «r» and «j», but they are not pronounced as in Norwegian
English was one language, I did not know that it sounded different in different countries
I think I learned to hear the difference somewhere between 7th and 9th grade
I remember the teacher being frustrated because we mixed American and Brithish English
Media was mostly American, schools taught British English
English sounds to me as a language that´s related to Germanic languages, but it´s like the weird cousin that shows up to the party even though noone invited them
I wish more french people would let their accent flow
a nice french accent is pure chef's kiss
Apparnetly austrians sound like farmers in german
I've only ever heard two austrians speak english and both have really thick accents
thicker than any german i've ever heard
As somebody that have met a lot of Fins (my brother is married to one) it is extremely easy to hear it
It is the same for us Norwegians to be fair
Oh gross
In Norwegian that'd be "Lestdet"
Agreed
Every Dutch person I have ever spoken to has spoken excellent English
I sometimes get Scots and Irish mixed up until i hear the other nationality speak
like if you went "Ah dinnae want irn bru" i'd be confused until the irishman next to you said "yur creizy, iren brue is **T**he bes**t**."
Rule of thumb, Sco**t**s do hard Rs, I**r**es do hard Ts
Yeah
arseholes who can't appreciate a good accent
smh
So THAT's what they mean by 'the hills are alive with the sound of music'... I thought they were just hearing the Bavarians
As a norwegian, i sure know what it feels like to be called 'singsongy' by our national neighbors
Only you're scottish and irish
No way in hell you'd be caught with an English OR American accent
Even if you tried
We say "to bite the sour apple" but that's when you loose, not when you die
There's countless expression for dying, some unique and some probably shared with lots of other languages
"Biting (in) the grass", but I've never heard it used
We say «parkerer tøflene», park our slippers, and the same as you with the sour apple
My favourite is "parkere tøflene", to park your slippers
Biting the bullet is from [the Indian rebellion in 1857]
The world organizes the winter olympics every 4 years and tries to compete with us
Everybody here speaks the same language, but that language can be written in two ways: Nynorsk and Bokmål. This means we have two written languages, but only one spoken
As a Norwegian, whenever a danish person start talking numbers I need to switch the conversation over to English
There’s no way I understand your numbers lol
In the dialect where im from we actually say numbers like the german way
Like 2 and 40
This is not really used if youre counting from 1-100 but mainly when theres a number in a sentence
I don’t understand our sports really
Skiing is understandable since we live in the north
Then we have chess with the highest rated player ever
Then of all things we have age of empires 2
Not cs:go, not dota, not LoL but aoe2 of all things
We also (sometimes) do this
At least the elder generation
It's so annoying when people at work read parts numbers this way, like "can you find me a one-and-forty three-and-seventy", then my mind sends me in the direction of parts beginning with a 1xxx instead of a 4xxx
It depends entirely
Old people usually say 2&80 when they are talking about 82
Younger people usually say 82
The reasons I have heard we switched to saying 82 is because of telephones
Imagine sitting there and a guy says: my number is 8&80 2&70 9&50 1&30
Saying it as it is is much simpler
The old fashioned way of counting was actually the correct and official one until 1950, when it was decided to change it to what we have today
Yes, it is
We have both north and Southern Sami
But as far as I know, the Sami languages are both spoken and written differently (I might be wrong here, not an expert at all on Sami)
What makes Norwegian different is that we have one spoken and two written languages within the same language
See, usually I can excuse it with the fact that I just don’t understand spoken danish very well (I don’t), but even when written out I cannot tell if you that is a serious number, and what it is, or if you’re just messing around lol
According to Spotify, the most popular non-English speaking song in Norway is the Swedish song “Svag” by Victor Leksell
This song has constantly been (over)played on the radio for months
The most popular Norwegian speaking song is apparently “Vakker og vill” by Rotlaus
Can’t say I’ve ever heard it before tho
I listen to the radio a lot and have never heard it there
Honourable mention, when it comes to Norwegian speaking songs, TIX has had a lot of hits lately
[Vakker og Vill] from Spotify’s [Norway Top 50] list, never heard of the song
I dislike this list though most of the songs there are really bad, but they must be popular since they are on the list
Svag is absolutely everywhere in Norway as well
Komplicerad reminds me of Eiffel 65's Blue
As well as Karpe
They’re guaranteed to hit the charts whenever they release anything
That song has been top 5 since January in Norway as well, im so tired of hearing it all the time
We make often make fun of Bergen, not the region just the city, for having a funny dialect
In Norway its Bergen
What are you talking about
Their language is perfectly understandable
Adana man
After my experience with knowing ppl from all over norway we just bully everyone
Also the way they stereotypically behave
Boisterous, loud and generally obnoxious
And every young person I've met from there conform to the stereotype
And the rain
93 rainy days in a row
200 days of rain per year
Give it back then
Dutch however that's kinda difficult
I'd say the rest of the Netherlands is the weird region in The Netherlands
We'll get the ships then
«What does the fox say» by Ylvis
I am not romanian but this song is, and this is the one song I am truly truly embarassed to enjoy
Just look at those moves
[Sandu Ciorba - Dalibomba]
[Badekaret til Pelle] is simultaneously our worst song and our best song
To me its russemusikk, its kinda like its own genre and its called russemusikk beacuse the russ plays it on their busses
I dont have a direct link but you can probably just search it up
The reason i hate ut is beacuse it is mostly uncreative and just boring
There’s this whole genre that I like to call «afterski music». It’s basically EDM music infused with folksy singing and horrible “rapping” about sex, getting drunk and afterski parties
I guess you can argue the music is made intentionally bad and ironic, but certain people seem to genuinely love it
I can’t stand it
Not sure why it’s a thing
[Here’s an example]
Probably when former glamour model Lene Alexandra released her song "My boobs are ok" [\(Youtube\)]
It's kind of self-deprecating, but still shit
The self-styled Icelandic Frank Sinatra, Geir Ólafs, sings „Santa Claus is coming to town" in Faroese, with terrible pronunciation because it most likely doesn't speak Faroese
[I apologize in advance
David Bowie managed to stay amazing until the end so not all old rockers
I think the latest two albums from Sir Paul are quite good
Some boring songs, but overall pretty good
No coke by Dr Alban is an absolute legend however
I randomly came across this song a long time ago and never thought it was actually popular, even though I have never forgotten about it
Everybody gangsta until the 2002 Chrysler Sebring shows up
Å helvete, is that song from here
It's SO bad, but it pretends to be legit in the same way as Live is Life
I thought Lothepus and Staysman&Lass, and all those afterski/russebuss artists were bad, but they're not really trying to be "real". Franklin tried, and failed miserably
Thats a masterpiece
Ylvis is a legend but that song was inescapable and I still see it from time to time
I agree 100%
I can't see the video as it's blocked
What are some notable people featured there
It sure is
In Scandinavia it's not as common for adults to live with their parents as it is in other parts of Europe
A lot of people go to (free) college/university when they turn 18, so culturally that's generally when people move out
The average age for moving out is 19
3 here in Norway, for example (or at least it was in 2009)
That said, in my experience teens who bring home their partners here in Norway don't face any adverse attitudes in general
I'm sure it varies, but I started having girlfriends stay overnight (and vice versa) when I was 15/16
Never had any problems with my parents or any of my girlfriends' parents
My dad had "the talk" (ie
about using protection) with me at some point when I hit puberty and that was the last we spoke of that
Bringing home a one night stand wasn't exactly common at 16, but I did go home with a couple of girls who lived at home when I was 18/19 (of course we can drink beer at bars at that age) and as you can probably imagine that was always a little awkward in the morning (the parents did serve me breakfast
), but I never had any horrible situations or anything
No separate doors or anything like that
When i was like 12
a girl was coming over to stay the night (there was nothing sexual about it at all)
My mom just told me she didn't want anyone to become pregnant and that was it lol
I was like "ok lol".
I've only lived for a short while in Singapore, and been on a short vacation in Thailand and Malaysia, so I don't know a lot about this, but I guess it's still a pretty common thing in East and Southeast Asia that sex is just a no-conversation topic
In Norway we have the Reindeer Police, who mostly make sure that the hundred year old feuds in the Reindeer herding comunities dont escalate into full fledged wars
The couse behind the conflicts is mainly because there are way more Reindeer than avaliable pasture
It is estimated that about 30—40% of the animals die every year, mainly by starvation
Most of the conflicts on grasing rights and herd size are handled by the courts these days
Finite resources + tradition + money = conflict
There have been some articles in the National media about these court cases lasting decades between families
But nothing that makes the evening news
[I love, love, LOVE it
Edit: It literally makes me cry every time I hear it
(And I'm not even kidding)
I love it, it moves me a bit when I hear it play during the medal ceremony at winter sports
It was written in the 19th century, but only officially adopted as our national anthem late last year
"Ja vi elsker" It sucks
It absolutely fucking sucks ass and i hate it
Too much religious shit, extremely boring, and it's waay worse than the one we had before it
"Sønner av Norge".
I would say 3 on average
Diversity is not the strong point of Norwegian food shops
So you can imagine my surprise when I first visited Estonia and this tiny country had 10-15 different types of fruit juices, 4-5 different brands of milk (Norway had 1 at the time, now we have 3)
It was like entering a different universe
Usually Granny Smith, Pink Lady and one or two others
Maybe two or three other ones if it's fall
Green and red but they are from different brands too
Usually green (Granny Smith) and two different red apples, but sometimes there are yellow apples and sometimes there are three different red, like when the Fuji apples are in season or the Norwegian apples are in season
red, green, yellow and pink lady
Heart-shaped waffle iron (the hearts are formed in a circle)
Norwegian flags to put on your balcony, on the christmas tree and to wave with
Crampons to put under your shoes
DAB-radios (we don't have FM radio here)
Idk
the [hackit] maybe
Idk if other countries has it as it’s quite a local invention from the tiniest place on the west coast
Not sure if EVERY household has it, but its popularity is growing
Cheese slicer, it's not only popular here but we may be the only place where virtually every household has one
A Norwegian flag (duh
The (Norwegian) cheese slicer is not quite exclusive to Norway, it's common in Sweden as well, but I don't think it's used in any other country
Norwegian flags for our [flag pole] our [balcony] our [Christmas tree] On our constitution day you find flags on our [cake] on our [car] on the [baby pram] on our [jacket] and in [everyone's hands] waving them in the parade, or while watching the parade along the road
What a glorious day that is
When I read bowls here, my mind immediately jumped to the same type of bowls
Everyone in Norway older than 45 has them
I literally have that set lmao
They aren't that uncommon here
You forgot ostehøvel :)
Listening to FM radio right now, bro
But you only get the non-mainstream channels
Edit: You don't believe me
Radio Metro
I always assume it's a foreigner if I see anyone under 60 with crampons
Ostehøvel
Cheese slicer
How do other people do their waffles
Squares
Here air fryers are pretty common, but i likd deep fried better
In Norway I find that many households will use a [variera holder] for holding plastic bags
Haven’t been in a single home where that isn’t a thing in this country
This is a thing here too, but usually not in a bag
Sorry to break it to you, but norwegians use this all the time
Its use is splitting ground beef while cooking it in a pan
I have one
It’s really uncommon though, I don’t think I’ve ever seen one anywhere else in Norway
I saw somone else suggest that, and it seemed like it wasn't as uneque as we thought
Analog radio was shut down in 2017 in favor of digital radio
I hear people complain about that, but my excperience is good so far
Crystal clear radio "anywhere" without any scratching sounds
Are they as popular as here though as in like every household has one or is it more of a niche item
Never heard of a Danish cheese slicer if I'm being honest, looked it up though and I don't think I've seen it, definitely not popular here anyway
The rotating ones with the slicing wire
Only seen it once in my whole life, in a Danish hotel
Okay, TIL
I just know that I’ve never seen one in Denmark or Britain
My (Swedish) husband eats a lot of cheese, so we have 5
Not even in old ladies's houses
Fair enough then
I guess it's a popular item in the whole of the Nordics
What is superior really depends on the cheese
You can't cut brown cheese with the Danish stringy thingy
Rumpetroll = tadpole: literal translation: butt-troll
I'm sure the swedes have a lot of Norwegian examples of words that sound childish as well
we have a few,
a gun - skytevåpen (shooting weapon)
a hippo - flodhest (river horse)
rhino - nesehorn (nosehorn)
fridge - kjøleskap (cooling closet)
sloth - dovendyr (sluggish animal)
we also have a thing called a ‘harrytur’ which is when you go across the border to sweden to buy cheap food, tobacco and alcohol
it comes from the upperclass in Oslo who looked down on the worker class, many of whom had been named Harry
it’s basically an adjective now, to be harry
Do you actually call the street crossings zebra crossings, or did my 3rd grade English book lie
Because I think it would qualify for OP's question
Likewise in Norwegian (skytevåpen)
Don't find it that weird though because not all weapons can shoot
Ofc your Danish with that name
My favorite is turbotorsk for shark
"Mus" is slang for vagina here, so it's not a word you'd use if you're afraid of being called a misogynist
> overuse the articles
I see what you did there
The benefits of really dry "school English" mixing with all kinds of more colloquial talk and neither really being learned properly
At least Norwegian and the other Scandinavian languages use "what" like English
Certainly not just you
I like the British, but they have possibly the most obnoxious parliament in the world
Æ pule ja
We have it and eat it too
"Have", but there are other verbs too
/r/JegHarSex
We cultivate it in Iceland too (*stunda kynlíf*, literally 'cultivate gender-life')
Don’t worry, [it was just a stupid play on words]
If using the word _sex_ or _samleie_ (intercourse), we _have_ it, but we have a bunch of standalone verbs that don’t require modal verbs, too
Cultivating is the foreplay, harvesting is the climax
The poppies themselves are seen as just regular flowers which grow in many gardens and other places
The seeds are seen as something that’s put on your bagel for decoration purposes
Nothing to do with opium or opiates, I doubt most people even know the drugs come from poppies
Same here, they have poppy seeds on some baked goods and some old ladies like to have them in their garden because the flowers are nice
I've sometimes joked that they should check the gardens around the villa's in town when I read about a new cannabis grow bust in town
[This is how we consume them]
Not in Norway either as to my knowledge at least
I have actually heard the term "blåfilm" (blue film) for porn, but it's not widely used at all
And then I guess there is "svart humor" (black humour)
Funny thing is that I was taught that in Chinese, pornographic content is sometimes named "yellow films" or something like that
Yeah that's true, especially with svart humor
The death of the norwegian Haakon Haakonson during an overwintering in Orkney
If he hadn't died that year, he is believed to  have accepted the request as high King of Ireland and the separate request as the new Holy Roman Emperor by the pope
This would mean a united Kingdom of Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Scotland, Ireland, and the holy Roman empire, which would have really expanded Nordic culture towards the mainland
The fact that we left the union with Sweden after a rigged referendum in 1905
Both countries would have been better of if we’d still be united imo
Edit: typo
If I changed any of the outcome I might cause a chain reaction that could accidentally delete my own birth and that would also make it impossible for me to go back and change it in the first place or some sht
Basically, by going back and changing an event in the past I will also eliminate my reason to travel back in time in the new future that is formed because the reason to travel back in time has already been taken care of
if you get what I mean
I’m simply not able to imagine changing the past because of this paradox
I also have trouble with time travel movies
(Edit because I think people are taking it the wrong way
I’m not sad, and this is not something I want to do
DO NOT GIVE AWAY JEMTLAND and HERJEDALEN
Cant believe we let that go
No I’m-
I’m fine and I didn’t mean for it to be sad at all actually
I changed the wording a bit so I hope the misunderstanding is gone
I’m not
I didn’t realize I forgot to put "accidentally" in there, but I changed it up a bit now
I'm Norwegian, and when I lived in Australia I found myself bumping into people on the sidewalk all the time
I couldn't immediately see why, but after a couple of weeks I realised it was because I tended to go on the right side while Australians tended to go on the left side
It wasn't super obvious as people still kinda walked wherever, but there was enough of a tendency to make me bump into people daily
It's really funny when you try to walk past someone, but they also try to walk past you do you just end up walking left and right and left and right
Some did like Tordenskjold, some did not
Some are just legends where it’s uncertain whether they existed or not
Yes, that would be a good comparison I believe
Yeah that’s true, I was just thinking of “legends” in general
Tordenskjold was in no way a Viking
No, masks (and antibacterial gel for that matter) are both insanely expensive, which is part of the reason the goverment doesn't want to make masks mandatory
The last mask price I remember seeing is 180 NOK for 10 masks
That is about 16
4 EUR according to a currency calculator I found online
You can get them cheaper online, I think
Yes, but not on masks
As far as I know there is no lack of masks at the moment, so no need to involve any law
But the government is regulating prices on some things to a certain extent
We have very high taxes on cigarettes
Extra taxes on sugary food
Low prices on medicine
High import taxes on food in general (to protect our own food production)
No law on prices of masks, they are actually quite expensive in Norway
But we don't generally use masks (we socially distance instead), so not a huge problem
Only place masks are recommended is on the subway at rush hour
I've seen masks in the store twice, first at the grocery store at the price of about 14€ for 10 masks, and at a pharmacy for 5€ for 5 masks
20€ for 50 masks sounds like a bargain
10 masks for 80kr at rema where i live
If we could have beer prices similar to basically any other european country that would be really nice
I would say "copy not freezing to death from spain", but spain is a tad too hot so I'll copy poland instead
Switzerland seems so practical, also the food is great
I just sant some real French pastries in Norway please
I want longer summers from a more southern country
Don't get me wrong, I still want a proper winter with lots of snow, but I also don't want 6°C and rain in June
Weather and cuisine from Southern Europe, cycling infrastructure from Denmark or the Netherlands in Norway, Finland’s education system and cool old buildings from almost anywhere in Europe
Rich Norwegian here
I agree
You should copy it
Come work her once the pandemic is over
Also, need to say, we arent rich because of the oil
We dont actually spend it
We save it
How do you see our foreign policy
Just out of curiosity
wait I thought taking off your shoes was normal
Think you're looking for the Finnish Education system
That's too true
Especially since we're more corrupt than you:)
I got a very surprised reaction from someone french once when I told them about the high school senior tradition (where you get a lot of dares to do among other things) and this one dare that is to hug a police officer
They were shocked at how easy it is to actually achieve that dare
Police officers will gladly give you a hug if you ask them, even in a drunken state
I never did it myself, but the image of having a police force without such mutual trust is odd to me
Another example: A Norwegian family lived in France for a few years, and the children talked about the differences in the school system
In France you are not close to your teacher, you are supposed to just do what you are told, and discussions in class is a lot less encouraged
In Norway you are on first name with your teacher, class discussions are encouraged, and many students get a close relationship with their teacher
(My son just lost his grade 1-4 teacher (you usually get a new one when starting 5th grade) and there were tears
Even among the parents
Interesting that its so different in France
[This is a fairly typical arrest in Norway] (Subtitles in English)
I think arrogant would be the last word we would use to describe them here
I don't think the difference is that big
But nepotism is still very common
There was a case where an extremely wealthy, actually Norways wealthiest woman was hired as the leader of a state owned company despite having no competence in the field and she was the only person they interviewed for the job
(she's very young and inherited all of the money too, so she probably isn't very experienced either)
So you have heard about that, huh
Is this the part with all the gilliotining and stuff
Nah, the forests do that well enough on their own
We don't exactly lack trees
Most people are more worried about rural areas getting overgrown as small farms have to close
Not sure if it’s our national liquor, but Akevitt, is usually drunken on Christmas, and tastes disgusting in my opinion, but my father enjoys it
Norwegian akevitt is made from potatoes, but from corn in other Scandinavian countries
But it doesn’t taste like potatoes
The flavors depends on what spices you add, and can be e.i coriander, lemon, caraway, dill, vanilla, cardamom and other
[Wikipedia ]
In the north we have Karsk, a drink made of homemade liquor(usually illegal made as anything above 20% is illegal) and old coffee, again disgusting, but will get you drunk real fast and many up north enjoys it
[Wikipedia ]
Edit: added links and more Info
Akevitt, or aquavit - strong liquor based on potatoes
I personally don´t really like it, but I drink it because it is my duty as a Norwegian
I do however love it in cocktails
Aquavit sour is one of my favorite cocktails, which is a whiskey sour where the whiskey is replaced by akevitt
Fantastic
Can confirm the awful taste
So Trøndelag is the north now
When I first tried whisky a few times I wasn't at all into it, until I found the smoky ones
Now I barely touch "normal" whisky and would never buy it
The price stings tho
Koskenkorva Salmiakki pls
Was he lord of the fortress or the Amt
Or perhaps even both
The most correct way to do it is to use 50 øre (0,5 NOK) or any other coin that is made of copper :)
I have only had it in Tromsø and Alta
Sorry about that
Should have described it differently
I'm not really a vodka drinker, but that thing, it's great
No, I never really struggled learning the language, but that might be because I started reading English books relatively early
I also watched English TV and movies from a young age
Speaking english is easy for me, English grammar is something i have to work on though
I was fluent pretty early bc I watched youtube in it's early stages, and we always watched english movies
Not really, English is kinda similar to the Scandinavian languages and I’m Norwegian so it’s not that hard for me
Nope
We learn it in school for a lot of years to the point thay i (Year 10) can say i have reached a middleground in semi-fluency
In Norway, we start very early with learning English in school
I think 3rd grade or something if I'm not wrong, I can't really remember
Personally I really like English and don't really find it difficult
There's a few words here and there that I need to translate, but otherwise I'm finding it easy to understand
Speaking it however is another problem lol, pronouncing the words and sentences out loud when you rarely do speak it is something else
Currently studying at a uni where the classes are in English so I have gotten some practice during that
I'm actually surprised when people who have English as their mother tongue don't know the right way to use their/they're/there, and where/were
I know right
*Omelette au fromage* comes to mind
Recently found out that you spell "jealous" as "jaloux", while we spell it "sjalu", which I thought was a joke at first
Also we spell "chauffeur" as "sjåfør". It seems you have a strong habit of keeping the native spelling of loanwords
He might have said *omelette au fromage* as they sound identical if not said very slowly
Don't think Dexter would have gotten one simple thing like that wrong
That does sound more like du, yeah
Also
it's not like we don't have guns
At least not in the Nordic countries
Few handguns, but lots of guns actually used for hunting
They're used for sport, not defence purposes
> Like, who are these people that feel the need to jump in defence of mega corps that have zero interest in anything besides maximizing profits
In general Americans trust big businesses more than their own government
(Weird I know
but it does explain things
The orange man is >!bad
You say "ugly/childish", I say "at least slightly more orthographically consistent".
> Like, you're six minutes three seconds tall
haha
You mean regulation to prevent outright lunatics from buying guns
Yeah, they're not too happy about that one either, no matter how shockingly obvious it is to half of the US *and* pretty much the entire rest of the world
We were taught "English-English" at school, but it's hard for a school subject to compete with years and years of AmE almost completely dominating the cultural scene with music and movies - pardon me, *films* -  and I think that's pretty much the case all over
Also, non-Brits tend to mostly associate BrE with that "received pronunciation" stuff and general poshness
I know that at least in my case, I'd like to distance myself from AmE but would feel like I'm putting on airs, and trying to mimic a natural dialect would just be worse
And the only vaccines are either hard to implement at a systemic level (make education not suck balls) or illegal
> in Europe, most people don't believe in the concept of races between humans, and just bringing this word up makes you look like a racist
I know
It's about the rudest thing you can do
And reminds me of when a African American friend from the US was visiting my husband and I in Norway, and he was amazed at the fact that no one was afraid of him here, and that people talked about him as "the American", instead of something else
He is even an elderly man in his 60's.
That's a point, and also why I used "slightly" :p
The Americans have a lot of quirks that are annoying, but speaking as a relatively unbiased ESL, I think the AmE spellings usually make more sense
They don't make the orthography *sane* by any stretch of the imagination, but hey
English
¯\\\_(シ)\_/¯
Agreed
The US spellings were a good step in the right direction
What do they call him
"African Brit"?
that's just weird
No one would call a white Brit (or Norwegian, or Dutch or whatever)  'American'..
Unfortunately, it's harder on everyone else
Not a city, but the country Greece in Norwegian is “Hellas”. But for some reason, we switch back for “Greek”, which becomes “Gresk”
København - Copenhagen
København more or less means "Buying port" in about all the scandinavian languages so i have no idea where "Copenhagen" comes from at all
Not a city name, but Greece is "Hellas" in my language (Norwegian)
Most of the big cities (en/no):
Copenhagen/København
Gothenburg/Gøteborg
Vienna/Wien
Cologne/Köln
Florence/Firenze
Bucharest/București (except we don't know how to pronounce the ș, so we just use s)
Prague/Praha
Warsaw/Warszawa
Moscow/Moskva
Belgrade/Beograd
Athens/Athen
etc
Hellas is simply the ancient greek word for Greece, so it works
We also use these names to refer to Finnish cities
be LOG nah
Is Iorua pronounced something like /iːrua/, or ee-roo-ah (I have no idea how to phonetically spell shit for English speakers)
It's not an accent, it's a totally different letter
It makes it look ridiculous to us native speakers
Example: Energy drink "Mønster" which translates to _pattern_, and is in no way like _monster_ (which is the same in Norwegian and English)
It acutally pisses me off whenever I see that braindead logo
OMG
Sikkert
Vet ikke, men det ser ut som "mønster" når jeg leser på boksen
og da blir jeg hissig, haha
I use Gdansk, but for Szczecin and Wroclaw I just use the German names
I have absolutely no idea how to pronounce them in polish
Onion is /nj/ though, while Bologna is /ɲɲ/. Not the same sound to us who have both in the language
Thst helped with Wroclaw(I can't find the /l letter in the keyboard), but I'm still not sure about Szczecin
I'll find something on the internet too listen to
I use [norgeskart] if I want high detailed maps
I use Google maps for the most part but i also use [this Norwegian map site] when i want to look at historical maps
The site offers very old maps that Google dosen't offer
Finn is even more detailed from my experience
Also [Norgeskart] by the Mapping and Cadastre Authority has all the map info you could ever wish for on a more technical level
From property boundaries, archaeological sited, ever house or shed, names of hilltops, earth quality and land use
How come
In norgeskart you even get color gradings of different types of borders and buildings, you get elevation curves, and you can toggle many more settings like information about properties etc
It has much more info than google
Although they are not aiming for the same thing
Google is more for ease of use, while Norgeskart focuses more on proper info about everything
I can’t check right now but doesn’t Norgeskart also have old maps from cities
Sorry, I meant satellite view
English people: Do you say you’re from England, Great Britain or the UK
But What is the country
Or are all three countries
1 NOK = A plastic bag
10 NOK = Cinnamon powder
100 NOK = 1 disposable wet mop
For 1nok, you can get half a caramel
For 10nok, you can get a lolipop
For 100nok, you can get 4 litres of milk
Aren't the bags 2 NOK now
Or perhaps it varies from store to store
I need to know where you shopped
Bought plastic bag 2kr and cinnamon (67g) 20kr at REMA yesterday
I'm being ripped off it seems
I love these examples
Can you even get plastic bags for 1 NOK anymore
The cheapest I see these days is 2 NOK
Two beers
That’s outrageous
4 cinnamon buns are like 70 NOK
And they don't even taste good
We are one of the most expensive countries in Europe so Ukraine would be a good break for us
Norway is an expensive country
It was REMA's prices I used
There's a cheaper cinnamon made by TORO aswell there
I have seen 2kr plastic bags but I usually see 1kr more
I'm lucky
So cheap tho
Here you would get one standard 0
4 beer for about 90 NOK
It was changed to Gøy - fun
G er for gode og gøyale gutter, Ø er for ønskedrøm, Y er for yppete og yppe alle jyplinger ut i det store hav
G is for good and fun boys, Ø is for wishful thinking and Y is for provoke trouble and chase all weaklings out to sea
The song;
He probably is
He never got that recipie after all
We began by learning printed-like letters, but we quickly switched over to cursive after
Didn't learn anything but capital letters and then cursive at my school
Can't really write print-like to this day
Cursive, but I transitioned to printed-like before middle school
My handwriting too horrible to write in cursive
You literally won’t be able to read it
Besides, I practically don’t write as a part of education or work anymore
I learned both in school
I remember cursive being a pain in the ass
My writing has ended up as a sort of hybrid, now though
we learn both
we learn print-letters first and then we have special books simply to learn cursive
the only reason we learn cursive though is to give is a legible hand writing
We learn both, and end up being confused and write like 6 year olds
> First in printed-like letters, then cursive
Same here
Source: I have children in primary school
Probably the one that charges tourists NOK 285 a head just so they can say they've been to the North Cape
Charging people exorbitant amounts for bottled water
Paying the sticker prices
Also, an hour long «fjord cruise» in a RHIB in Skjolden cost 600kr per person
All you do is drive along the same route the cruise ship sails just to see a waterfall, but you have to enjoy the view from sea level instead of the sun deck on the ship
For 800kr they let you off to walk up to the waterfall and wait for your return
Experienced a strange version of the rose thing when I walked past some palace or other in Wien
There was a small square in front of a door, I walked along one edge and on the other side, at least ten meters away some woman with roses suddenly stretched out her arm and held out one
Did she really think that would make anyone rush over and toss money at her
Same in Norway
Some taxi companies are overpriced, but not outright scams
Some restaurants are tourist oriented, but in general are OK-ish overpriced food
Beggars are our main thing to look out for too, especially the Romani ones
They pickpocket a lot
It sound weird enough to be interesting
In reality, I think it's a little - what's the english word for food that's kind of stretchy and tough, the opposite of tender
I ordered a seafood mix at a restaurant in Greece 2 years ago
The octopus tasted good but but i didn't like texture
It felt like i was chewing plastic
Im not a big fan of seafood to begin with, so I would pass
I've had octopus sushi in Japan, was alright
Not something I think I'd ever add into my regular diet though
But certainly didn't freak out about it, we eat a lot of weird seafood to begin with
Definitively strange
I'd put it in the same category as snails
Then again, the only seafood I eat is fish
Won't touch shrimp, they remind me of wasps
I just now realized that we don't differenciate between squid and octopuses in Norway
The english wikipage on octopus doesn't even have a norwegian version
> galician style octopus
Tapas must-have
Yummm
Nice, thanks
Our next biggest city, Bergen
The delightful scottish custom of alfresco fridge burning
The only thing I prefer about the US is that most public restroom have paper seat covers but here if I need to drop a deuce in public I have to make a nest of toilet paper
So no, I think I’ll stay where I am
I feel safe here
I feel safe most places in Europe
Absoutely not
It would be a downgrade for me in virtually every way possible
Less safe, more corrupt, fewer worker's right, worse press freedom, worse choices when voting, worse healthcare system, plus I just prefer Norwegian culture, language and way of life
I don't like the superficial, more materialistic way of life in the USA, where people think bragging is a virtue
No thanks
I was an exchange student there for 10 months
That was enough
Short term
Yes
Long term
Americans work themselves to death, and unions don't the same power
My life is not to be dictated by some owner who I will never meet
Yeah sure, if it wasn’t for the healthcare and the freedom to roam we have here
But otherwise I would; preferably on the east coast
I like the US, and I hope to visit my family there sometime
I notice this subreddit often is very anti-American
It’s okay to have an opinion about the US and criticizing some things without having a constant superiority complex about yourselves
A lot of Europeans think Americans have a superiority complex; I think it’s the opposite
Interested in visiting it, yes
Interested in living there for more than two weeks; hell no
We would have been fucked royally as Norwegians moving to the states
I'm on sickleave for depression and anxiety, and i would have been living on the streets at this point
Especially the candy, KitKat should be illegal dont @ me
Exactly
It was my glib way of answering the question in the negative; no, I would not want to live in the USA
I agree so we could reconquer Jamtland and that other part as well
To be fair, KitKat is originally British, and the Brits have decent sweets from what I've heard
But I know what you mean
KvikkLunsj forever
Say it in norwegian too, but that is probably no surprise
Still says alot about cultural differences thoe, lol
We do it in Norway too
Wow, looks like I’ve got next weekend’s entertainment all sorted
Thanks, Amazon UK
You use English terminology in the Netherlands
Duly noted
Duly noted indeed
Do I need to leave them sitting out for a while in the sun, or is that going a little too far
Asking for a friend
Yes, I've noticed this
Isn't that a shame though that you don't come up with your own definitions and words, but borrow from English
How does this work with older people not being fluent in English, do they need to have certain words in public documents translated to them
I don't think it's seen as too private
I've heard my mum's birthing stories multiple times, as well as other people's.
I'm afraid my mom starts talking about it whenever mine or my sister's birthday rolls around and we're home
My family, not so much
My colleagues, all the time, and I'm a dude
Even worse
They’ll gladly share details about their sex life, their partners and how they perform in bed for each and everyone they want
Soon everyone in your village/town/city/company/school knows how you do
Taking a drink with a girl friend (friend) at a bar
She’ll confess her sex life in details, long record of it over decades, to me (a guy)
I’m just not interested, neither of being gifted any knowledge of this or being exposed myself
What the fuck is wrong with you
Just stop this practice
Now
Just stop
It's different from family to family
I've heard a lot from my mother in law and her kids, but nobody from my own family really gave any details until I was pregnant myself and then they told EVERYTHING, as usual
Depends on the family
The christian part of my distant family wouldn't dream of talking about birth or sex or anything of the sort with their children
Probably kebab
Oslo has a shitton of kebab places everywhere
> roast dinner
As comfort food
Your boyfriend/girlfriend just broke up with you, and the next thing you do is make a roast dinner
> Probably if you were devastated you'd visit your mum for it though rather than make it yourself
Good point
Norwegian has a tradition of calling countries by their native name
Czechia is Tsjekkia, Greece is Hellas, Italy's Italia and Austria (Österreich) is Østerrike
France is however Frankrike, Finland is Finland (not Suomi)
Also, names of Asian countries tend to be the same as other western countries use instead of their native names
Japan instead of Nihon, Kina instead of Zhongguo etc
Edit: Forgot to mention that Hungary and Croatia are Ungarn and Kroatia respectively
There are no country which are completely different from the English wording in our language
Most countries names are translations from their English equivalent
The only country where two different names could be said are The Netherlands with Holland as the other designation
But, using that today would be all wrong considering the Netherlands are more than just Holland
&#x200B;
Edit: As below pointed out, Greece = Hellas, for us
Totally forgot about that one
Germany - Tyskland
Switzerland - Sveits
Hungary - Ungarn
Czech Republic - Tsjekkia
Belarus - Hviterussland (White Russia)
Austria - Østerrike (quite literally the same as in German)
Norway= Norge/Noreg (It's practically always pronounced Norge, but it's written Noreg in Nynorsk, a secondary form of written Norwegian)
Sweden=Sverige
Russia= Russland
Greece= Hellas (Grekenland is sometimes said by old people)
Switzerland= Sveits
Hungary= Ungarn
Austra= Austerrike/Østerrike
Germany - Tyskland
Hungary - Ungarn
Greece - hellas
Greece = Hellas
Austria = Østerrike
Germany = Tyskland
Russia = Russland
Belarus = hviterussland
there are probably a lot more but these are the ones i remember at the moment
Some more, not all are native names - some are "Norwegianified":
* Belarus - Hviterussland ("White Russia")
* Estonia - Estland
* Sweden - Sverige
* Lithuania - Litauen
* Lebanon - Libanon
* Morocco - Marokko
* Chad - Tsjad
* Switzerland - Sveits
* Canada - Kanada
Well, Germany and Tyskland come fron different roots, don't they
But Tyskland from the same as Deutschland
Edit: And also Greece - Hellas
Only country outside of Hellas to call Hellas Hellas and all that
Even though most words are some translation of some sorts, they still might look different so people from other countries might be confused at first (I have frequently been confused by the English names, mostly when I was younger but sometimes my brain forgets)
Some country names that look different than the English name:
Belarus - Hviterussland (means white Russia, but I think I learned that russia isn’t an exact translation of rus
Austria - Østerrike (just like Österreich)
Hungary - Ungarn
Czechia- Tsjekkia
Switzerland- Sveits
Germany - Tyskland (Tysk mean German, so it’s basically Norwegian for Deutschland)
I also feel like we don’t really say UK, we use Great Britain - Storbritannia
Thailand
That stems from a spelling reform from the early 1930s, where traditional German/Danish influenced names were replaced with something closer to the native ones
It used to be "Grekenland" from German "Griechenland" through Danish "Grækenland". Also, "Rom" and "Lissabon" became "Roma" and "Lisboa". It was not very consistent, however: They didn't replace Ungarn and Finland with Magyarorszag or Suomi, for instance, and in the case of your country the capital is called Athen instead of Athinai, the language is called "gresk" and the demonym is "greker".
Its basically same
We say Montenegro, what do you say yourselves
Sverige is the Swedish word for Sweden
That's not norwegianified at all
Kanada with a K is [wrong
White Russia is another name for Belarus in English and Russian as well
Elfenbenkysten for us, which is a litteral translation of Ivory Coast (Elfenben - Kysten)
And for some reason, governmental institutions (most notably NRK and Språkrådet) insists on calling Finland (the country itself as well as towns and cities) by their Swedish names, not Finnish
NRK News will say Helsingfors and Esbo instead of Helsinki and Espoo for instance
That's like pissing the Finns in the face imo
I agree
I always use the Finnish names both at work (I teach geography) and in everyday life
Same with barbers and hairdressers here, for some reason
They seem to prefer English puns though, like Hair Today, Cutting Edge, and Pubic Enemy No
1^(\*)
^(\* Ok, I made that last one up)
Not exactly known for bad puns on their shops, but in Norway any alcoholic beverage that has more than 5% alcohol is sold through a state-owned store called Vinmonopolet, The Wine Monopoly in English
In Longyearbyen one of the worlds most northern "cities", the store is called Nordpolet, a play on the Norwegian word for the north pole: Nordpolen
Pretty much exactly the same in Norway, and almost all of them have some grammatical error in their name
You're apparently not a proper hair salon unless your name is a bad pun with poor grammar
There are a lot of Norwegian puns as well
På Håret
Fruktbar (restaurant)
Kos Dykk (dykkesenter i nynorskland)
Glade Hjul (budbilfirma)
I can only think of "Hair and there"
The most famous one in Norway is probably "du må ikke sove", which translates to "dare not to sleep".
The poem written in 1936 is about the Nazism and Fascism's onward march in Europe; a warning against indifference, human contempt and a warning against what would happen
I can think of two
One is [Heimskringla] by Icelandic poet Snorre Sturlason
It is allegedly about the first kings of Norway, with a bit of mythology mixed in
Some of the stories are short and centered in Norway, while others, like the story of [Sigurd Jorsalfar] (The Crusader King) is action packed and follows the characters fighting Arabian pirates in Palestine
A bit more modern is [Peer Gynt] by Henrik Ibsen
It is a play centered around the titular character, where he first travels around the beautiful Norwegian countryside, lies his way through every situation, and travels all around the world and then dies
Smarter people than me can probably go in-depth on it but it is considered nationalistic romance at its finest (even if Ibsen didn’t necessarily think of it as such himself)
I think I'd go with Terje Vigen for us
Do domesticated or wild animals wander around residental areas where you live
Some news local to me: [Reindeer wander around residental area] (in Norwegian) knocking on doors with their heads and eating flowers from people's gardens
Like most reindeer in our country, these are not wild, but semidomesticated and left to wander around by themselves most of the time
I imagine similar might happen in other Nordic countries, but I'm curious to know if this is a common occurrence elsewhere
Do deer gnaw on plants next to your house, to take an example, or do foxes lurk nearby hoping to find food
I grew up in a residental area out in a small rural town
The houses bordered a big forest area and while you rarely saw animals going up to houses they were very close by
They found wolves feces a few hundred meters from my house one time
And moose wander around aswell
I often see roe deer in my garden and the streets in all seasons, and I live pretty deep in the city
I live a bit outside of Oslo so it's common to see deers in people's gardens and I always have to look out for moose when I'm driving
I'd rather drive of the road and possibly crash in a tree or a ditch than one of those big fuckers
We had a fallow deer just outside the house once so that was nice
But normally it's smaller animals
When I grew up we had a lot of sheep breaking into our garden
There was one particular sheep that learned how to jump fences
So it was always able to get to the delicious grass (and flowers
) there
(Later came the rule that all sheep in that area need to be fenced in
I live in the South, and moose and deers are definitely common here
They eat everything in the gardens so people don’t really like having them around
But I like looking at them and find them beautiful
Except from wild birds, the neighbourhood cats and the occasional squirrel, very seldom
I saw a deer some years ago running through the neighbours garden and down to ours and into our road, it had come down the hill where I live
It used to be normal to see a moose or a deer when our neighbourhood was surrounded by more forest, meadows and fields, but after it became built down the animals disappeared as well
I live in Norway too and it’s very common to see reindeers and moose outside the window, I live close to a lot of acres where you you most often see them
And one time a whole moose family were right outside the door
And recently I have heard that an Eurasian Lynx has been wondering close to the neigbourhood, though I haven’t seen it myself
The rarest animal I have seen close to the house was some sort of lizard I don’t know the excact name of it
I have meese eating my fucking apples every year and it's pissing me off
We also have foxes, badgers and what seems like an invasion force of deer in my area
Last winter I almost shat myself when I aimed my head lamp at the field next to the road I was walking on at night and saw what must have been 20ish pairs of eyes staring back at me
I'm strongly against it
In winter and in Qatar with the deaths of underpaid and mistreated workers
It's a hard fight between FIFA and the IOC for that top spot
Could just watch a pirated stream
Well it is
Doesn't mean it tastes bad, but it's certainly not as "exciting" and flavorful as more southern cuisine
I guess they haven't tried our fish dishes
Some of them can be called nasty, or vomit-inducing, or crimes against humanity, but not boring
Where i live in the south the meal on Christmas Evening is boiled cod with boiled potatoes
(I'm not kidding)
I'm from the west myself so I prefer dried (and then watered down) sheep meat with potatoes and mashed swede
My (South African) husband still can't understand why anyone would choose this meal for the "main meal" of the year
Obviously it came from a time when salting and/or drying was the only way to preserve meat and fish
(And my Norwegian self thinks is delicious
We got fish, cold fish, warm fish, fresh fish, dry fish, fried fish, and lutefisk
I think the ocean has is a big part of it
I mean, in scandinavia it's mostly fish and potatoes
I don't know anything about Germany or Poland so I guess southern food is nore exiting
France and Italy have all this super fancy food
Fish is still very nice tho
Because that's 100% how it is
And when it isn't, you wish it were
My hypothesis is that countries further south had much easier access to spices and things like that, and quite probably a much larger range of things that would grow
Because they are
I am genuinely courius, what is so bad about the norwegian cuisine
Different variations of meat/fish and potatos is so good, thats like all I eat
> I view Norway as the darkest pit of culinary doom
Thanks
The best food I ever ate travelling around Europe was in Belgium
(Yes, better than the food in Italy and France)
What
Don't u LOOOVEE fish and bland potatoes
Nah for real our cuisine is *chefs kiss*
I feel the need here to take a stand for Norwegian food
I'm not saying we're on par with France or Italy, but we're honestly not worse than Denmark or Sweden
I think you haven't tried a lot of traditional Norwegian food, and that's not strange because it's not easily accessible for tourists, as restaurants rarely serve it
It's stuff that's made at home on sundays
Yeah we do have meat and potato with brown sauce, but so do about everywhere else in the northern hemisphere
We really do have some unique traditional food with exotic taste
Pinnekjøtt
Fårikål. Rakfisk
Lutefisk
Smalahove
Acquired tastes for the connoisseur
Well reindeer tastes really nice
For (Northern) Norway, salmon of all kinds, my favourites are creamy salmon soup and smoked salmon, also fried pollock, fishballs, reindeer stew/roast/jerky, and ptarmigan/elk after the hunting season
It's not all bad
I mean it's in our culture because it has been that way for centuries
The light meals in Norway have traditionally been either re-heated porridge or a flatbread (soft or hard) with stuff on (mostly sour milk cheese or other milk product)
We've had less than 100 years to "catch up".
Most fancy/foreign Scandinavian restaurants aren't very representative to the normal cuisine though
They tend to get rather creative with their recipes and choice of produce from what I've experienced
Fårikål - Sheep, cabbage and black pepper
> Well historically, it's also not true
Dunno about Finland but Medieval English food definitely made use of loads of imported spices
The reason British food has a bad rap is cos of rationing in the war
The older generations basically forgot how to cook any of it
Medieval *upper/middle class* British food
The average peasant wouldn't have access to them I reckon
At least not here in Scandinavia
The average person would hardly visit a market as they would often be a day or more away, living mostly off grain and milk from the farm
Maybe some ginger or such for special occasions, as has been known since the 17th century here
Some local herbs and spices were used though
Only among older people
(My grandmothers favorite)
Isn't water a spice
It makes a fart smell, in at least two different ways you can interpret that sentence
Thanks
That means a lot coming from a continental
People drive for 2 hours to buy cheap bacon and alchohol in Sweden
Well, Guinness could almost be considered bread, no
Gamey I guess
I grew up on that stuff so I love it
I think you need to get into the old mentality of saving it all up for nice food on a Sunday
When you get 50% of your calories from barley, and 40% from milk products, there are only so many things you can do with them
And believe me, we have tried all the different things you can possibly do with those ingredients
Food on normal days wasn't supposed to be anything special
Just fill you
Sundays had better food
Usually meat, which wasn't common in the week
As well as vegetables and such
With a side of preserved berries for sweetness and maybe even some butter
People would get really into it for holidays
For example my region has a boiled meat dish with ginger and nutmeg for a party (wedding, funeral, etc
) dish
And people get really specific about the various details and methods
If you're from north or south of the onion belt for example, or you serve it wrong
Or other foods we deemed important, like ale, the fancy bread, or christmas food
Yeah they deserve credit for that, but it's still not really representative I feel
The techniques and dishes themselves are quite important
I could go to Canada and have native Cree people serve me food from more or less the same ingredients found here, but I doubt it would be similar
The secret ingredient is snot running from your nose, your face so numb you cannot feel your chins and a Finnish social realism series of your choice on full volume in the room next to the dinning room
I don’t think that’s true
Potatoes and bread are very important in Nordic cuisine
Yeah, but I just mean that it's not exactly that representative
Most Britons never had that spiced food I can imagine
So it's weird to argue that "*Medieval English food definitely made use of loads of imported spices
*" as you say
If it is anything like Scandinavia at least
We have preserved medieval northern European cook books written in Old Danish and such, popular in towns
But towns were just a tiny minority of people back then most Norwegians never had the spiced food with cloves and cinnamon described from there
Since we're analyzing, I think I have three; makes farts smellier, makes a fart-like smell, and it "makes" a fart smell (like "manners make the man")
At least in our language
[Here they talk about the electricity cables connecting Norway to "the continent"] We are connected through Russia, but I guess we never felt very connected to Russia as a country
So that might be the reason we feel disconnected land wise to the rest of Europe
Haha
Come to think of it, I have no idea whatsoever what you eat in the Netherlands
What is common traditional food there
(Meat/fish and potatoes as well
Norway, Finland, Sweden, probably Russia too
I'm not saying it's bad or anything
Just that's it's not a very good base to form your opinion on nordic food on as it's kind of its own thing
And I mean even if Russia had been in schengen it would still be easier to cross by boat, bridge or plane than to go all the way there
Yes
Three is more like if you're an absolute fart aficionado and think that, without the cabbage aroma, any fart smell lacks just a little something
You are living on islands, so that makes sense
We are physically connected to the European continent, but in our minds we are not, kind of thing
Since to go to Europe we need to cross the sea, as no one would travel to Europe through Russia
So we see Europe as something "down there"..
> Boerenkool
Looks really nice
I get what kool means (it's kål in Norwegian), but what does "boeren" mean
It makes even more sense for us I think
England is closer to most of continental Europe compared to Norway and Sweden
Sweet Caesar Two Regime
Got it
I have never heard that before
We've always just said Romerrike  / Roman empire
Ahh okay, TIL
Yeah, but it’s failing miserable and I hate it
Just let me use my English technical terms and phrases
Am in ICT, so my view may be *slightly* biased
Yes
Hashtag is "emneknagg". They apparently don't understand that they can't make longer words and expect people to use them and they are like half a year to late
We do
Språkrådet
Some of what they do is just stupid, like spelling bacon as beiken or service as sørvis
Some of what they propose is used though
I saw a guy here use nettbrett instead of tablet as an example
Nettleser (webreader) instead of browser
Skjermbilde instead of screenshot
Norway does have a long history of regulating the language
Sometimes successfully, sometimes not
The most terrible failure was in the 50’s when they wanted to regulate how we count
Norway used the German method of counting
We said tre-og-tyve (three-and-twenty), which was replaced with tjuetre (twenty-three)
70 years later, both methods are in use, and people will say shit like «tjuesyv» (27, with the old word for seven) instead of «tjuesju» or «fem-og-tjue», which is 25 with the modern names for the numbers but in the old-fashioned word order
We so got språkrådet (language council) but
they're not really that good at their job
In that they often will replace established English words with Norwegian ones that are just stupid sounding
Like Halloween to gresskar kveld (pumpkn night/eve), hacker to datasnok (computer sneak
I am so using "kropskondom" from now on instead of sovepose
Related to this, to my Norwegian ears, it always catches me off guard that Danes use the word teenager and weekend
It sounds so unnatural to me, where we have tenåring (very literal translation but it works very well) and helg (never actually looked up where it comes from, but I think it has to do with the same word for saint
Edit  I was sort of right, "helg" comes from old norse "helgr" and is the same as "hellig" (holy)
So "helligdag" and "helg" etymologically means the same
Group sex in Swedish is gruppsnusk according to Norwegian jokes
46 minutes ago I was called an idiot for writing 'advice' instead of 'advise'. So I guess that is my answer
I'm fluent enough that I don't really mix up words in general, though there are some spellings I still struggle with
One that I still struggle with though, is to vs
too
I usually get it right, but I have to stop in my tracks from time to time
And it took me a LONG time to get into my head that "its" is used when talking of posession of something, like "the elephant found its stick" and not "the elephant found it's stick", since usually ownership is indicated with the 's, but not here (the your vs
you're stuff though, piece of cake)
I very recently was told that when people say "he yelled at me" it doesn't actually mean yell
It means like "scolding" or something, though I was told scolding is what one does to a child, so yell can mean both scream and harshly talk to somebody
In my native tongue, there is a distinction between yelling and that other yelling
So this bothers me because I don't feel "yell" is the right word to me lol
I also still have slight problems with that "jump" both means to jump, but also get frightened
So I struggle more with words that I usually have two words for (and that are very different things) but in English has one
It's actually fun though when it's the opposite, which is quite often the case
Like English is smart enough to have the word "teach" and "learn", while we just have "lære" (though you can add a word like "bort" - away, to mean "teach")
Or lots of other little words describing emotions and stuff
Yeah, he is probably American or Australian or something
Sadly, there is a rule saying, there are no rules without exceptions
Some people say that rule is itselfs' only exception
And then they get all smug about it
Obviously a difficult word to translate litterally, as it naturally will never be words necessarily meaning the exactly same things in other languages
Oir literal patron saint is a guy they dug up from his grave only to find his hair and toenails had grown
He was therefore believed to be holy while in reality this happens to every corpse
Dude you need a France flair
For English speakers: Chuck of Gaulle
One of the local rich guys just spent 1,5 million euros trying to spread knowledge about "the science of intelligent design"
There are no scientists claiming the earth is flat
And I have not seen any doctors or scientists suggesting that everyone should stop vaccinate their children
But there are in fact some [real scientists] saying human activity have little influence climate change compared to other factors
But no, none of them are really a thing here
Never heard of any Norwegian believing the earth is flat
Extremely few opt out of vaccinating their children
And most political policies promote limiting CO2 emissions
Antivax and flat earth are very small movements here thankfully
A not so small minority are climate change deniers
What is "mainstream" are alternative medicine and beliefs (homeopathy, chiropractic work, acupuncture, etc) (biodynamic wines, Steiner schools, believing in "spirits")
Came here to say the same thing
Well the outcome is that a foundation working to promote creationism got more money to spread their message
How many will buy into the bullshit in the long run is of course unknown
Definetly
The fact that the russians liberated the northern lands without occupying them is a huge boost to the norwegian opinion of russia
Not that I'm aware of
Interesting
When the Soviet Union attacked Finland in 1939, it made virtually every Norwegian dislike them
During the war however, they became allies, and they liberated Eastern Finnmark
This made them very popular in Norway after Nazi Germany capitulated
(Source (in Norwegian):
Not forgiven, but we've moved past it
It wasn't the German people per se, but one party lead by a crazy dictator
We understand that the German people are in fact not nazis, and are nice and well-mannered people as a whole
I mostly browse pictures of cats, so no
Yes, its probably one of the reasons i can't stand top level comment from Americans about America here
Like let me have this place without you adding to it the thing i already see all over
I do not mind them doing this as child comment to a top post however
It feels more like a conversation then and not that guy that always talk about themselves talk about about themselves again
I single out the US as it permeate reddit vs any other country so you get your fair share of them all over the site
Now I don't hate the US users on Reddit, I wouldn't be here if i did
Sometimes it just gets a bit much and i need respite from y'all
To draw a European equivalent, back in my early internet days you would be the Germans coming to the English site you hung out on then refused to speak anything but German until some admin made a German corner they could hang out in
For real though, why you do this Germans
I wouldn’t say isolated, but I feel like it’s skewed in a weird way
I think I rather see American culture as special – not isolated of course as a whole lot of it is exported, but they care about a lot of things that no one else in the world cares about, especially sports
Not the best of examples, but a lot of Americans find it interesting and relevant to go ‘hurr durr let’s talk about Minnesota Vikings in this post about historical findings about actual vikings’.
No one except Americans care one inch about their team’s song or existence for that matter, but as they’re disproportionately represented here (Europe has more than double their population) that’s probably what you end up having to scroll through anyway
Edit: To add to all this, I have a much bigger bone to pick with ‘[pet] cuteness’ culture, which I guess overlaps but isn’t uniquely American
It’s that thing where people think pets doing X and Y is _exclusively_ cute and how dare you point out that human body language could possibly be a less than optimal way to interpret their behavior
Or when people go ‘I do this with my pet all the time so your *general* advice is wrong’. Somehow I feel that being super anecdotal like this likely means you’re an American
‘Don’t you come here with your pesky facts about pet health, you’re ruining all the fun
For cats
r/cats, /r/kittens, /r/FromKittenToCat are good starters
Especially the kitten one
Kittens are the best
Also r/mildlystartledcats is pretty cute
Took me a while to rewire my brain to accept it as ‘the last place they’ll call home’.
Except Kardashians, I dunno if there is a subreddit for them, but knowing reddit, and americans, there probably is
Same
This smartass, throwaway comment has really helped complete my subscription list
r/catdimension satisfies my cats *and* shrooms
Well, almost
How did I not even know this was a thing
This is wonderful, thank you so much
I love this
Someone else recommended this earlier and I checked it out to make sure it was SFW
It's not just SFW, it's also adorable
And for added chuckles, I'm a gay guy
I expected a raised eyebrow or two when I tell people I'm checkin' out tight pussy at work
I love cats
I love cats *so much*. I go out of my way to pet a cat that I see walking down the street, I talk to cats, I even idly think about cats
Other than my family and close friends, I think cats are probably my favourite things in the world
I'm baffled by how so many people love dogs, I don't like them at all
But before I say anything, I have to stop and think, „hey, ormr_inn_langi, you *reeeeally* love cats, so maybe shut the fuck up
All I ever want to do in life is roll around on a big, fucking lawn with a happy cat
Not at all
I'm just using different words that happen to be in another language
The idea/thought behind the words is the same regardless of language
Garbage truck driver
Mortican is perhaps the word you’re looking for
They also get paid extra for working in close proximity to bad smell and
garbage
It's honestly not all that bad once you get used to the smell
I worked as a garbage man for a week one summer and all days except one was quite bearable
The advantage we have in Norway is that there is often a bit of wind
Which helps I would imagine
Oslo: Rich, expensive, international, socially divided
Bergen: Rain, loud, slightly obnoxious people, nature, fjords
Trondheim: Students, moonshine, leather vests, mustaches, Rosenborg
Stavanger: Oil, stuck-up people, oil, pulpit rock, fjords, oil
Drammen: Norway's largest intersection, trying desperately to be something more than Norway's largest intersection (and succeeding
Kristiansand: Religion and heroin
Tromsø: Northern lights, cold, dark winters, bright summers, "Paris of the north"
Bodø: Windy as fuck, shit weather, fish
Ålesund: Beautiful, boring as fuck, very beautiful though, mountains, fjords
Trondheim: Stupid People
Bergen: Stupid People, rain
Anywhere in the north: Angry Stupid People
Even further north: Sames
Oslo: Spoiled Stupid People
This is how Norwegians look at other Norwegians
Bergen: Rain and a funny dialect
Can you do Sochi and Murmansk as well
I'd add "rain" to Bergen, or shit weather in general
Also maybe Rosenborg to Trondheim, biggest football club in Norway, It's certainly an important part to the city's identity and something I think it's well known for
Alao, Birmingham: Black Sabbath
Good point
Added both
Here is an awesome YT video from a linguist about your topic
Same thing happened with the Langobards in Italy: they basically adopted the Vulgar Latin spoken by their subjects over time, [but some Germanic vocabulary took hold]
> Younger people think it's shameful I think
No need to feel ashamed
I feel absolutely no shame at all for all the killing and looting the Vikings did
Youre being generous with us, frænd
Cant call iceland and some islands in the north sea an empire ;(
It's more recent yes, but as the years go by it will continuously move further into the past
Ah, yes
Christmas trees does wonders
But you are right, sending Pakistan a Christmas tree might not have the same effect
True, but no one sitting in government today had anything to do with it
Anything with a “sen” “ssen” ending could be Denmark, Norway, sometimes Netherlands
Add a Magnus, Ivan, Søren, etc
I think double first names are more common in the north
Names ending with -sen like andersen or johnsen, they're probably from Norway
I guess because of norse tradition of like "son of". If its -son it could ble sweden or even iceland
Lol funny that you think those names sounds like they are out of a fairy tale
They just sound like very dull names for middle aged men to me
And in my experience, it's most common to have a short name first and then a longer one, like Bjørn Tore
However, not in Sunnmøre, there it's the opposite, like Tore Bjørn
Edit: I should clarify that Tore is longer than Bjørn because of the number of syllables
Norwegians typically use -sen like Danes
If someone in Norway is called -son, I usually assume they're Swedish or have Swedish heritage
That's just in Sweden afaik
In some areas in Norway (mostly the west), -son -søn and -sønn endings used to be more common, and none of them used the double s.
Yeah, many people seem to think we use -son, probably because of the old viking names
But then after the viking age, we were under Denmark for over 400 years and adapted your naming traditions, so -sen names are now the standard in Norway
This is our top ten surnames:
Hansen
Johansen
Olsen
Larsen
Andersen
Pedersen
Nilsen
Kristiansen
Jensen
Karlsen
\+ a bunch more -sen names and farm names
The first -son name is Andersson at around 170th place
We do at least in Norway
I know some people with the son ending, but they are not nearly as common as sen
I would guess we probably stopped using the son ending sometime under Danish rule
I'm half Australian, half Norwegian, grew up TCK (France, UK, Sweden, Thailand)
Moved back to Norway at 25 after living abroad most of my life, spent my teens in Australia
Miss Australia and feel like I don't always fit in here, but I went to Australia for a visit a few years ago and didn't fit in there anymore either
I dont know what my future plans are, but with two kids and a husband I'm likely to stay put
I do dream of going back to Australia though, I miss the Sunshine, the culture, friends and food
But truth is its too expensive, my kids won't hace the same quality of life as here in Norway, and home ownership seems like a pipe dream over there
responsible thing is to stay
Here's hoping I win eurolotto

Where did you live in the 20 years prior to moving to Spain
I'm impressed with the fact that you left the UK after so many years
How is business in Spain
> Brexit broke our hearts because we had a great life there
Because of the effect it would have on your business
Or something else
I have always lived outside the EU (Norway), so I can't really relate I guess
> Children
We wanted them to have the opportunity to live and work in the EU
Ah ok
Anyone can apply for a job in the EU though, whether you are a citizen of the EU, or the US, or India
But its obviously a bit easier living in the EU

Yes
My South African husband tried for a few years talking me into moving to the UK (way before Brexit was a thing)
He never succeeded, so we are still in Norway
"Mi taco tiene pinta de vagina podrida" in Spanish (from the dark web in GTA V)

Russian: Jåp tvåjo måtj blatj
Ya nye shchi, ya ogromnaya utka
(Apologies for lack of Cyrillic letters
(I no longer have any idea why I learned this
Jeg er en pølse means I am a sausage
It means «my taco looks so tasty

Yes, I think that's it
It's supposed to mean *can I pay with bananas
Definitely Norwegian, and probably Danish also
Ahah i know, unfortunately

It's a very handy phrase indeed
I intend to use it the next time I visit your beautiful country

And I am not even exaggerating
The movie "Flåklypa Grand Prix". Its an animated puppet movie made by Ivo Caprino
And the best movie ever made
There is a trailer on Youtube
If i knew how to link it here i would
Yeah you are right
Im a little slow but think I finally figured it out
Flåklypa is still a great movie, just the fanvase is so so
The only one i know is a crafting channel

We have gotten 0 points four times, so take your pick for the worst one, lol
Personally I nominate [this one] from 1997
[Mil etter mil] also got 0 points, but it's kinda legendary here in Norway
Jahn Teigen (RIP) was a Eurovision/MGP legend here
[Here] are all of Norway's entries so far for those interested
Bonus fun fact: We've come last 11 times (in the final), lol
Tooji - Stay (2012)
this for sure (in my opinion)
My Heart is Yours by Didrik Solli-Tangen
Me and my family are still pissed because we didn't send Bjørn Johan Muri with Yes Man to Eurovision that year
It's been 11 years
Who was that guy who represented you a few times around 2000-2010
I think he had long colorful hair dyed different each time
I loved watching when he was on
He was a nice break from all the others
This one from 2012
[Tooji - Stay]
It got last place and is by far the worst one in my personal opinion
Don't get why Teigen didn't get more points, that man was a legend
> Personally I nominate this one from 1997
Oh, that one was awful
How the hell did it win in the first place
oof i agree
I didn't need to be reminded why I gave up on caring about our "representative". Thanks
I find Tor Endresen much worse than Tooji, the late 90s early 00s was a bad time for us in Eurovision, lol
I completely forgot Tooji was a thing
I suppose that says something
I have ptsd i also hated haba haba
I have absolutely no idea
It's Tor Endresen
Sorry, my bad
It was Ich Troye from Poland
Maybe I'm wrong, or maybe he never got to the final
I'm looking through finalists from several countries now, man
there's so much weirdness
My favorite from that period is 1999, but that's only for the nostalgia as it's the first Eurovison song I can remember hearing as a child
Oh yes, like I said - I like it purely for the nostalgia
He was awful live
Stig Van Eijk
So nostalgic
Not saying he was good live to begin with, but he actually did have an earpiece problem in the Eurovision final
He was clearly much better in the Norwegian final
Oh, intreresting
I was like 6 years old at the time, so I just have fond memories of the Chicago Bulls shirt and black marks on his face with the very catchy song
Yep me too lol
I was 8-9 years old and remember he was gutted right after the performance because he couldn’t hear himself
This is not a thing i Norway
We were at neutral country in WW1
We were neutral which I assume is why we have no special traditions regarding it
I always call it Czechia, both in Norwegian and English
Plus, it sounds natural, like all other countries that ends with ‘ia’.
I also think it’s kinda weird to call a geographic region by its governmental form, so I just call it Czechia
Same way I don’t call Norway the Kingdom of Norway
It's not a shortening, it's the name of the country
The government may use a more pompous formal name, but the proper name is still Czechia
Does it really or are you just not used to it
The present Norwegian flag is just so pretty
We shared a flag with the morons to the East, and we called it Sildesalaten (the herring salad)
But in 1905 we grew up and made our own nation with our own flag
When you can buy a case of beer for around 100kr, that makes you happy indefinitely
[The medieval flag] of Norway which, not really a "national flag," was used by the king and used on ships and military fortresses in the 13th and 14th centuries
It’s still used today as royal standard of Norway and is flying on the roof of the royal palace in Oslo
Your flag is awesome
I just can't shake the feeling that it lacks something
I'd like to see children drawing this
Yeah, the raven banner is my choice even if it's not a proper national flag
That's their sole intention when designing something like that and legalizing weed
I respectfully disagree
The bright red is what makes our flag so lively and almost cheerful
You guys' flag could well be darker, but the bright blue is cute, too
Just like you are as a people
We use *sjalusi* (just a Norwegian spelling of the French word) and *misunnelse* (which literally means to begrudge someone something)
We get them mixed up too
We often use "jealousy" about romantic jealousy, and "envy" can even be a compliment, e.g. I envy you your hair (a thing a woman can say to another)
Brødrefolk unity
Yes, like most countries (exceptions I know about are Russia, Poland, USA), there are large dialectal variations in Norway
For much of the country you can easily hear what village someone is from if you're familier with the area
Words for "I" include jeg, jæ, je, e, eg, æ, æg, ej and i.
Lots of dialects
And some of them are rather hard to understand
Im not shure, acording to online sorces it have never been counted
But seeing that the dialekt differ from one city to another, example Arendal - Grimstad - Lillesand ( ca 15 - 30 min travel with car between each) they think we have as many dialekts as places
It would be Intresting if someone did count them though
I had an Internship In Wangen im Allgäu.. That was an experience Haha
> North Estonian dialects are actually genealogically closer to Finnish than they are to South Estonian dialects
TIL
Damn, there are parts of Listerländska that sound exactly like some dialects in the Sunnmøre region in Norway
The first few words that came out of that old mans mouth is exactly how my grandfather spoke
The first part, where the old man answers with "Jau, det var det
" is like exactly the same, especially the "Jau", as i would write it more like "Jaøu" in Norwegian
&#x200B;
Interesting stuff
For its size the variations are very small, aren't they
Accents yes, but not dialects as far as I know
At least no well known and widespread dialectal differences throughout the country
So basically very small changes (in comparison to many other countries)in a very huge country, not large dialectal differences like here
Here you drive for twenty minutes and meet people that use different words than you
For example this means the same:
Æ veit itj
Eg vetsje
Jæ væt itte
Now Im curios about Australia though
How is it there
Pretty much agree
I would add: Oslo also has Finance, Govenment and Media
Jæren has agriculture
It is called Pfizer/Biontech, but if shortened it is called Pfizer
But I not think it is considered to be an American vaccine, it is quite well known that it was developed in Europe
I honestly haven't been paying any attention to that
It may be about taking credit even if it doesn't work
Norwegian, Sami, Icelandic, Faroese, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portugese, Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, Russian, Polish, Croatian, Greek
English, Swedish, Danish and Spanish
Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Italian, Spanish, english, German, Frensh I think thats all, so only 8, I have forgot the others I guess
I probobly knew more when I was younger, but those are long forgotten
Norwegianswedishdanish, German, English, French, Italian, Spanish
Probably Dutch, if I remember correctly I read Dank U on the McDonalds trash can in the 1990's.
After learning it in Danish and Swedish, I don't suppose it was to hard to learn the Norwegian word for it
Pretty much the same word, "tak" in Danish and "takk" in Norwegian
The Danish spelling would in Norwegian indicate a long vowel sound, but they both have short vowels
"Tak" in Norwegian means "roof" though
You can add Norwegian and Swedish, too
It's the same as Danish, just tiny variations in pronunciation that foreigners might never get just right anyway
If you say "tack
" everyone will smile and say "værsågod", " varsågod" or "kamelåså".
Obligatory "Happy cake day

If the response would be limited to how they address actual school shootings, I don't think it's anything to be overly worried about

I got this brilliant idea: you take two boards of wood, strap them to your feet and go out in the snow and glide forward on them, possibly downhill as well
I don’t know if this has been tried before
Dødsing
Diving, but you fall belly first and correct it into a streamlined dive as late as possible
We already did this
It's called the Winter Olympics
Ok, so I know this will sound a little crazy
But
What if we add jumps to that
Uh , our northernes would give you a good fight there
People from the south would just enjoy the show, but people from the far North
I was at a party with a bunch of them once, and my ears were ringing for days after
We don’t need to add any sports
We are already dominating in almost every form of sport with skis on the feet
Oh yeah, I did think about that, sounds a bit wild, but okay
Do you think the neighbours will fall for it
When LIDL was around in Norway, they introduced the whole reload your cart and bring it over to another counter thing, but I guess people thought it was too much of a hassle and went to a different shop instead
After 6 months or so they introduced standard, Norwegian tills where you pack your bags at the end
Norwegians are among the people in Europe who shop for groceries most often
Most people I know shop every day on their way home from work
I guess having to learn a new system while being stressed out and wanting go pick up the kids isn’t an optimal situation
My bet is that the same thing happened in Sweden
I don't think Denmark will play a big role, cus you know is like a pancake down there
But maybe Sweden would try to compare
Anyways I was wondering what you were gonna call this sport
Both
Gear optional
Neither Denmark or Sweden will stand a chance, that’s exactly why I came up with this group of sports, for the Kingdom of Norway to be superior in a Olympic
I think we could call it something like winter games or snow planking, something like that
No, but it was unfimiliar
Norwegians buy sausages in vacuum sealed plastic, not jam jars
Lidl came to Norway before the local supermarkets had startet introducing their own low-cost brands, so Norwegians had to buy branded products
Now all supermarkets have their own lines of products
I guess LIDL came to Norway ren years too soon
And also, the Norwegian stores were trash
The Lidls I’ve been to abroad have been a lot better than those that were in Norway
True, true
And snow planking seems pretty solid, man
Didn't REMA 1000 buy out all Lidl stores
Yep, but apparently that contract had a clause that Lidl can buy out all of Rema if they want to
There are a few
The "no to road tolls party" has been mentioned
A couple of comedians started Det Politiske Parti, "The Political Party" in 2000
According to [wikipedia] one of their slogans were "the elderly are in a way also people, and should be treated as such". They didn't have any opinions about anything and wanted people to send texts with opinions during debates
Most of their debates were boycotted by other parties
They got almost 20 000 votes the year they ran, but that wasn't enough to get in
There was also Vigrid
Right-wing-Norse-mythology-neo-nazi-party
It was run by Tore Tvedt, who lived in a caravan
The party was popular to use as a subject in school projects, as Tore Tvedt answered to every email from every student, usually the same day and in incredible detail
Pirat partiet : Meaning pirate party, their main goal is to make pirate copying movies and songs and series etc legal
So basically to remove copyright
I sensed Vermin Supreme before I even finished reading the comment
Well, it's a democracy
I've signed petitions like that without actually voting for the party
I wouldn't sign for neonazis though
Maybe us
We're not stupidly big in land area, 6th largest in Europe but I believe our geography and how the land is "distributed" if that makes sense makes us feel much larger than what we actually are
For instance, we're only slightly larger than Germany but much more difficult to get around in and we have far greater distances, due to us being essensially one long stretch of land and Germany being more of one united mass
This is probably more for Europe though, in a world context we probably still don't count as big
Argentina (2
78m km^2) or Indonesia (1
90m km^2) I think
Indonesia is sometimes mentioned as a big country, but I've never heard anyone say it about Argentina, yet, it's massive at more than 1/3 of Australia's size
Yes, exactly like you described them
Must be Oslo, it’s the only proper city we got after all
It’s the city that can offer the most of them all in this country: good restaurants, great bars, some fun clubs, world class coffee and cafes, cultural venues including one of the best opera houses in the world and exciting galleries, exciting new architecture, leafy streets with beautiful houses from the 1800s, elegant squares with fountains, it’s the most European place in Norway, it has got life and a magnificent location between the fjord and the spruce clad hills, not to mention the charm of the trams
Poznań is a cute town but it very small and boring compared to Wrocław, which is very vibrant and has a lot to offer
This is weird coming from a Norwegian I guess, but I lived in Wrocław on my exchange and visited Poznań. Loved Krakow as well, never been to Warsaw but I heard from a lot of people that it is quite drab
I love Oslo for all of your reasons
It's just big enough that you can discover new places a do new stuff all the time, and it's usually visited by the world's biggest artists
But it's also small enough to get around on a bike
The vast forest with lots of gravel roads and lakes is usually no more than 15 minutes away
I am also secretly in love with Bergen
It's got its very own vibe with old historical buildings, different architecture and very different people from the Oslo people
I would actually have to agree
I think Oslo is a bit underrated among Norwegians, especially non-easterners who like to hate on it
What I like about it is the size and that it feels like a proper city
I was kinda suprised after having lived in Trondheim for over a year now of how small it feels like
The city centre is where everything happens here and you can walk across it in 15 minutes
Oslo has that anonymity feel which I kinda like, in addition to pretty good public transit which I also appreciate
100% agree
Oslo is the only proper city (though Bergen comes close)
And tourists usually don't come here to see a European city, they usually come to see the nature
What's so good about Oslo is the size relative to the proximity of nature
You don't have to travel far to be in the middle of a forest
Not much of a fjord lol
Lots of places has a North
I dont think most tourists are going to the forests of Oslo when they say theyre going to see Norwegian nature
Very true, I was a bit quick there
It was
The peak of Norwegian humour is just saying English memes in Norwegian
While reading through the comments I can't remember a single meme I've ever seen in Norwegian
Although I'm sure they exist
Any other specific subs/groups you would recommend
Trying to learn french and need some dank learning resources
Ich habe eine einene Nervenzusammenbruch
J'ai apprendu en peu
Or something
But I am listening to the innerfrench/cottongue podcast now
I like the idea of just jumping into trying to understand stuff rather than focusing on grammar og "beginner" material
I subscribe to Nordic memes
Filters
How do you do that
No, I have no filter in place and I have experienced no issues with that
This, and adding/removing subreddits as interests come and go, especially remove subreddits if they go full retard, which some of them sometimes do
I don't think I've ever even visited /r/all
[Falstad fangeleir] it's a prison from when the nazis occupied Norway during WWII
I was a typical bratty teenager, but when we entered the showers I had shivers down my spine
It wasn't a single day, but my class went on a camping trip for a week to a place called Stryn when i was 12
It was unusual hot that september and we slept in the woods under the stars almost every night
We did alot that week like fishing, Kajakking, trips to nearby mountains and grilled hamurgers and such
Good memories
we went rafting down a river and everyone at one point fell of their rafts and got pulled under the water
also, some idiots decided to make a makeshift flamethrower inside the boys lavvo
which is not very smart
Not single-day if we count the journey; but when my school from Norway went to the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland
I went there as well
Made a big impression
I just read a bit about the camp, I remember visiting the forest nearby and a memorial there
I couldn't recall being told that the gestapo murdered 200 prisoners in the forest and put them in unmarked graves
damn
If I remember correctly: 5th or 7th grade from the school nurse, and in 10th grade from our teacher
At my children's school a nurse does it during secondary school in 7th grade
But they also have some in 5th grade done by the teacher
But my children asked where children come from before they talked about it in class, so I had given them the basics already
we usually have people from the local health clinic come in for one or two classes to educate along with the school nurse
other than that we learn a bit of the biology early by just the regular science teacher
We have a science show on TV (Well, not really science anymore) called Newton
In like, 2016 or something, they started with a segment called the Puberty series
A warning was showed before it started
It was borderline porn
The host would touch people's dicks and pussies and explain stuff
Pretty fucking weird and I turned the TV off immediatly when it came on
9th grade from the nurse for me
In 5th grade at the school I went to, the nurse would co-lecture with our regular science (naturfag
) teacher
I take it wasn't the same for you
We saw this cartoon about how babies were made in 4th grade, then we learned about sex, stds, and condoms in 9th
No, only the nurse
I remember falling asleep over the table at a Vietnamese restaurant in Prague while I was interrailing
In Norway we call it «Kalkun», it comes from German and is a shortened version of Calicut hen
Which is a city in India
Norwegian-German here
Born and raised in Norway and lived here all my life, but been to Germany 10ish times by now
I have living family there that I keep in touch with often and I relate to a lot of their culture
I do speak German but I also understand way more than I speak it
So I do identify as 'both' but I like to make it clear that I am mostly Norwegian and the German side is just the extra
Norwegian/Icelandic:
I don't consider myself Icelandic, because I don't speak the language that well, and I have only lived there for less than a year
This question makes me wish I had payed more attention in history class
That would be Nice
We were thought that the British get offended if you say toilet instead of restroom
I have later discovered that this not true and most the people I know say "I'm gonna have a piss" or something similar
I remember learning in German class that male cousin is "Vetter" and female cousin is "Kusine" (probably because those words are so similar to the Norwegian "fetter" and "kusine")
It took me years of experience outside of school until I realised that these words were outdated/not used at all and that Germans instead use Cousin/Cousine
I remember being told that nobody uses "hi" in English, and that I should use "hello". I know it doesn't answer your question properly, but I'm feeling rebellious
"horses eat hey"
Lol I've never heard of that,  we call it banan
Also, if it were a Norwegian word it would have been spelled gulebøy. Now I might actually start using that
Yeah, I assume so :)
Yeah, since I hear Kusine in German, it took me a while to notice the other spelling
Do I remember correctly when I’m thinking you pronounce Cousin with a French accent though
Like an “ah”-ish ending instead of “-in”?
Like roboglobe said, gulebøj wouldn't even be the right way to spell it even if we did use the word (which we don't)
Minnepenn is more common than minnepinne, but both are used
What's wrong with agurk
Ahh, this explains it
Finally
I'll send a letter to my school and make them change it
Change the school to a toilet
Interesting, thanks for the info
It's always fun to learn little nuances like that while learning a language
I mean, I don't know about the school you went to, but mine could definitely use an upgrade in many areas, especially the toilet department
Thanks for the info
I really like Norwegian place names
I like that you can very easily trace lots of the names back to the old Norse meanings
And then there is a lot weird names like Hønefoss - Hen/chicken waterfall, or Nykirke - new church
Nykirkes church was new 400 years ago
Basically same in Norwegian
I looked it up, and the original name in old Danish was Køpmannæhafn, which should mean something like merchants harbor
(before that it was just called Hafnæ - Harbor
If I'm not mistaken, I think Tolkien used Celtic as basis when making the languages
I might not recall correctly though, so take it with a grain of salt
technically its north finmark with 1
5 people per kilometers
But to me its the  Hardangervidda, in the middle of norway
Its right betwin oslo and bergen but almost no people live there
Just old cabins, mountains and lakes
Gokk
Litterally, "gokk" is something people say when they're talking about middle of nowhere
depends, there are several types of ‘middle of nowhere’.
we have jan mayen, or peter Ists island which is pretty isolated from literally any humans
we have exetremly desolate areas in finnmark and the plateaus where you won’t find anyone for miles, but you’re still in norway proper
and then there the middle of nowhere, where people actually live
like inland østfold or inland rogaland
basically anywhere not on the coast
Tbh most of the country could be considered "middle-of-nowhere"
Pft, Norway's middle of nowhere is obviously Nord-Odal
The correct answer for Norway is "everywhere that isn't Oslo".
Come on guys
It’s totally Bouvet Island
It’s literally the most isolated island on the entire earth
Every part of norway that isn’t a city is middle of nowhere
I would say the central part of Trøndelag outside of Trondheim, or Gudbrandsdalen
But Finnmark is also a perfect example
These places are literally so old and empty omg
Also called "Gokk", like where I live
basically anywhere not on the coast
and the smattering of wierd territories we have such as jan mayen and peter 1sts island
We have a lot of places like that or worse
You're now banned from Bergen
> I would say the central part of Trøndelag outside of Trondheim, or Gudbrandsdalen
There's tons of towns and more or less continuus farmland and inhalation there though
Middle of Østerdalen is way more desolate
Lampedusa is pretty isolated I guess
Closer to Africa than Italy
yoo you're from Gokk
me too, neat
Let us not forget Bouvet Island
Very common, and not only that but most people choose to go south aswell
Northern Norway is loosing its population and only a few places (mainly the cities Bodø and Tromsø) are actually growing, the rest is slowly dying out
It says it all when Northern Norway in general has only about 2k new inhabitants each year
Definitely not the other way around
well, at least for young people
Young people flock to the cities after growing up in their small home town
I am one of them
What you mentioned is a pretty similar situation in Norway aswell
The older people are mixed
Some stay in the cities, but most stay in small towns, especially in the north (north of Oslo) because it's more quiet, less stress, etc
Not only Northern Norway, but more rural places all over the country lose particularly its younger population to the cities and especially Oslo
My husband and I want to move to his small hometown, but there aren't any jobs for us there
so we're staying near Oslo for now
It kinda sucks tbh
It's sad to see places lose population
Thats a wonderful trend
"Don't enter the train tracks"
Should be commen sense, but you know: some people are dumb (or rather do dumb things)
It makes me think back to the time I traveld to japan, one day the train was late due to a train suicide in akihabara/ or another part of tokyo, dont remember where we was
Ann the automatic english voice said "train delay, cleaning remains". So train tracks and signs related to it sounds more menancing to me now
Probably [this]
The text means "Warning goes for the whole Svalbard archipelago". You cannot go outside the town without having a person in the group with a gun
Jøss
Det var ekstremt
Burde nesten stenge det området, da :o
So true
But sadly its commen in japan, no one reacted at all
It dos makes you realize how dangerous trains can be though
Thats intresting, but what about fences
A problem here is that they dont fix the fences often enough
I used to live next to train tracks and there was alot of holes in the fences, bent open
Ser ikke ut som det står det nei, men det sier seg vel selv
Norwegian: personskade
> and there was alot of holes in the fences, bent open
But who are these people making holes in fences around train tracks
It's a mystery
Its wierd, its not like they use old trains you can hitch hike with anymore
I dont think there is any sort of organized rugby here
Dont even know how the game works
I had never heard about until a rugby ball had gotten thrown in my face at gym
Too bad the Belgian/Dutch spring season of cycling was stopped this season
You guys have the best races of the season
Wtf is grid iron
Both milk and eggs go in the fridge
That seems to be the most common way of doing things in Norway
You store fresh milk in room temperature in France
Yeah milk goes in the fridge, if not it'll turn sour in a day or so
Cold milk is the best
With eggs I think it kind of depends on the household, was housesitting for someone that had their own chickens and they just let the plucked eggs stay out on the counter in a bowl or something
For me though, I put it in the fridge as soon as I get home from the store
Yep, especially since they're both in the fridge at the store
Not in Norway
Unless you buy of a farm/local egg, eggs are always in the fridge
This is the first time I've heard of UHT milk
We don't do UHT milk here, it's some sort of temperature processing of the milk and makes it shelf stable in room temperature and can last for months
The process definitely has an impact on taste, but it's ok for cooking, baking or to put in coffee/tea
My french mother in-law always keeps some UHT milk in the cupboard in case she runs out of normal milk
[UHT is around] , I’ve just never seen anyone buy it
I’ve never looked for it
I remember that we had it in school for cooking, but kolonial
no is a normal online supermarket, so it is being sold to consumers
I bet Tine is the only company that makes it, and as my little political statement I never buy Tine products
For that stuff, yeah
Normal milk is 14-18 depending on the store
Like I said, I’ve never seen anyone buy it
I’m guessing it’s an expensive process for a product in very low demand
Here’s our normal stuff:
Now this is some time ago, I was on vacation as a teenager to the Canary islands
I ordered a T-Bone steak and could only get halfway through it, It was delicious so i was trying to eat more and took breaks until the waiter noticed this and asked me if I wanted to take the rest with me
Up until that point i had only heard of this in American media, i think i recall the fantasy-scene in Dumb&Dumber when Jim Careys character gets into a fight with the Maitre d' and puts his heart in a "Doggie bag".
People usually don’t ask, but I have never had any issue the times I do
Some restaurants even encourage it, so they don’t have to throw leftovers away
You can often ask for a paper bag and the restaurant will give it to you, however I don't think people do it that often
I've never seen it done here
I have seen it done in the US, but it seems to make more sense there as pretty much anything you order will sustain you for 2 days
Depending on the restaurant, it would probably be seen as a bit tacky here
You go out to eat at a nice restaurant and have a fun evening
Food is just part of it
A restaurant is way more than just a place to buy food
I have asked to take home leftovers when I've been to family restaurants with my kids
That's not a problem
But I would never even dream of taking with me leftovers when dining out with friends
That's just not something you do
Besides, what am I to do with it
Bring it along for the rest of the evening
Place it next to me in the bar
Take it to bed when I get home
I get it that staff ask you when portion sizes are huge, but I never really understood how this is supposed to work if you A) don't drive to the restaurant yourself and go home directly and B) regard a restaurant as nothing more than a place to buy food
It's mostly the same in Norway
However, it varies from home to home how common it is to leave food
All my grandparents were young during WW2 and my parents always had to eat up because: "You're lucky you have food
" My parents were a little less strict with us, but throwing away food you have paid a lot for was never an option
Eat it up or we bring it home
Same in Norway
Norway hasn't got a culture of eating out, its more common now but was quite rare for families to dine out
So with my limited experience in restaurants I never saw anyone take any food home
Usually they just say they're done and the waiter takes it away
I agree that it is wasteful
All through my upbringing i was told to think of the poor children in Africa when I didn't finish my plate
Its quite common for my generation to be brought up that it's a shame to not finish the food on your plate
QWERTY, with Æ, Ø and Å to accommodate the Norwegian language
I have a Norwegian keyboard, which uses QWERTY  but also includes letters such as å ø æ and has some things shifted around
For example, there is a whole second line of icons with the numbers, and things are shifted from the keyboards I grew up using in the US
@, for example, is underneath the 2 instead of above a different number
[Image of layout]
It annoys me that Denmark went for JKLÆØ, while Norway has JKLØÆ and sweden has JKLÖÄ. We all agree on the placement for the Å letter
Due to this difference, and keyboards being made for the Nordic countries usually has a common layout, the Ø and Æ button has three different symbols
Yeah I have white letters, green letters and red letters
For some reason I am using the white letters which are the Swedish ones - but when I type it comes out as the Norwegian ones
But yeah - they could have at least made one Nordic version
That's a good question
Honestly I never even noticed there was an €-symbol on the E-key until now
I've had my computer for 6 years
1, 5, 6 are the only numbers to only have "shift + key". The other have both shift and alt gr
I just use USD, GBP, or EUR when I'm referring to currencies anyways
Yup
The Danish have those two switched around in the alphabet order
You guys made me laugh
Thanks
Did this guy finally find something Scandinavia doesn’t top out in
They do this in the Netherlands
(Where do you come from
I would definitely say its because of the price
Its the same here in Norway, you bring alcohol for yourself and taking someone else's is seen as stealing
A lot of the times people will share, sure but with young students especially, people bring enough for themselves and cant really afford to share
I really felt this cultural difference when living in Poland
Buying a bottle of liquor or more beer than you need was no big deal so sharing it didn't really end up in a big loss and vice versa
It was nice, I miss it
That would be odd here in Norway too
People use curtains that let the light in, but blocks the view
But then again Norwegians in general are quite private people
it’s the same here, you only drink what you bring
or if you manage to convince someone to either buy for you or sell to you
Same here in Norway
So probably a weird Scandinavian thing
I would say its because of the price, yeah
You guys can get beer for 25 cent, if we had that relative price for alcohol im sure it would be different
Over here it usually takes maximum 30 days to throw someone out of a house
Covid-19 made no difference to that

Isn't there a percentage, though
X percent of the parts must be made and assembled in Switzerland

Not using your own dialect is looked down upon in Norway
Context doesn't matter, you should never ever change how you speak
In Norway your dialect is a very important part of your identity
Not keeping your dialect is somewhat like denying your roots
Due to the geographical boundaries the different dialects have all developed in their own distinct way
In my area, anyone is able to tell in which of the 4 neighbouring towns a person resides in, simply by the variations of their dialect
As a kid, I often found it difficult to understand my grandparents as they came from a different part of the country
Therefore by changing your dialect can be pretty hard and it doesn’t sound natural
No dialects are seen as lower class or uneducated, but there are a couple of stereotypes:
Toten-dialect: farmers (they have a lot of potato farms)
Nordlending: fisherman
Finnmarking: reindeer herder
Sørlending: religious
Trønder: moonshine brewer / skier / moose hunter
Gudbrandsdøl: knows norwegian fairytales and folklore by memory
Setesdal: WHAT EVEN IS THAT LANGUAGE
ELVISH
Here in Norway everyone is proud of their accent, and it’s shameful to loose your accent
people almost go as far as calling people who lost their accent as traitors, kinda ridicolus
In Norwegian, we have a word for trying to speak another dialect or language in an unnatural manner (i.e. unsuccessfully): *knote* ([ If I would try to adapt to the dialect where I live now, it would immediately be noticeable, and it would sound weird
Therefore it is much better to just stick to the dialect you grew up with and that you speak best
On the other hand, some people adapt unconciously, speaking a mix of dialects, especially if living in another place for a long time
This also sounds weird, but strangely you notice right away that this is the case and it is accepted (although trying to keep your dialect is much better), as opposed to conciously trying to speak another dialect
Nah, sørlending is danish
No one touches that willingly with a ten feet pole except on the weekend we call summer;)
My grandma is still bitter over me changing my dialect when we moved to the north when  I was 10
Great times
I've lived in Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger, Haugesund and Ålesund and never once heard someone not speaking their dialect
The only exception is immigrants not from Oslo, now living in Oslo, trying to speak with an Oslo accent
Not one that you would switch to
The King speaks a rather posh Oslo west dialect
Politicians speak the dialect of where they're from
The royal family have also grown up in the West end and Asker, so it's not like it's forced either
It's very close to how normal people speak there
Not really imo, he speaks as a 85 year old guy from the Non-worker areas of Oslo
Off course it’s going to sound posh when it’s an old dialect
The older neighbors I had(dead or moved) here in Bærum spoke like him even if they had grown up in lillestrøm or Holmenkollen
Yes, definitely
Well, non-working areas and west is often two sides of the same coin
I'm surprised about Lillestrøm, though
And no the only dialect change I really notice in Oslo is between the East and west in the city, the areas around Oslo and even Lillehammer has a very close dialect to the standard Oslo
Lillehammer is actually quite funny since the areas between them and Oslo has kept its dialect
Yeah, today it's kind of an urban-rural divide, at least in the east
Not weird
You just read a book or scroll through Facebook while eating
Not that I know of
A lot of business travelers eat alone
I don't care what other people think of me
I like to go alone sometimes
The same with the movie theater
Depends on the restaurant
Going to a fancy restaurant with a fancy name that serves fancy food, that's a little strange
McDonalds alone is ok
I think you're on point there
I would only ever eat out alone if I was travelling with work and they paid, but I wasn't with anyone else from work
And yes, talking restaurants here, not mcdonalds or similar places
A meal plus a beer or a glass of wine at a restaurant would cost about 40€, which is a couple of hours work for most people here
No, it's just another thing that 'Murica should've left back in the 19th century
Its outlawed and Will count as murder or stealing
To be fair, US police also have little to no education
To become a police officer in Louisiana, you have to take a 360 hour course
Divide that up in 8 hour days and you're looking at less than two months of training
You can't even call yourself a barber with that little training
Here in Norway you have to get a bachelor's degree in police science
But I think also the police in US have very little education, sometimes as little as a few weeks
Depending on state
And my axe
Fårikål. A super simple but very delicious dish with mutton, cabbage and black pepper:
Rakfisk, fermented trout
Admittedly an acquired taste, but if you can overcome the odd smell, it tastes almost like an expensive cheese
It's unique and delicious
Something for the connoisseurs:
Pinnekjøtt, dried and sometimes smoked lamb ribs
Served with mashed rutabaga:
I wish instead of reading comments I could look at photos
And let us not forget the regional speciality [pølse i vaffel]
Personally i was going to suggest the Norwegian Kjøttkaker(Meatcakes)
It's like Swedish meatballs but proportional to testicle sizes of Norwegians as opposed to Swedes
You forgot Smalahove, literally a [sheep's head on a platter] Not that you really see people eating it every other day
I agree with your list but I would like to include the family of "potetball". Raspeballar, klubb, komle, småball, fiskeball
And it keeps going
Churned potatoes, flour, salt and water, sometimes filled with meat
My grandmother told me that when she was a budeie on the støl they made ball filled with whatever they found, like pebbles and screws and made it into some kind of weird lottery
I prefer my balls to be filled with mår.
The lamb ribs are a traditional Christmas dish, so it's only really possible to get hold of here in December
But it's a real treat
The rutabaga/swede/turnip mash is also great and goes well with many dishes
Most people have some carrots in it here too, plus cream
I like to add some sweet potato
A nice trick is to put some of the fat from the ribs in it, makes it real rich
When it comes to the trout, well some people really like it, while many people find it a bit repulsive
I think you need a bit of an open mind to enjoy it
If you're ever given the chance to try it, don't be a chicken
You'll be missing out on something entirely unique and different
Norway has eight sites on UNESCO’s World Heritage List
And that made me realize I’ve only seen two of them, so now I got some ideas for next summer
Bryggen (1979)
Urnes Stave Church (1980)
Røros Mining Town (1980)
Rock Art of Alta (1985)
Vegaøyan – The Vega Archipelago (2004)
Struve Geodetic Arc (2005)
West Norwegian Fjords – Geirangerfjord and
Nærøyfjord (2005)
Rjukan–Notodden Industrial Heritage Site (2015)
Kind of expected Nidarosdomen to be on the list, but I guess it's not really that significant among the thousands of churches in the rest of Europe
I have not seen a single one of these and to be honest, I do not even know what some of them are
I have never heard of the Vega Archipelago or the Geodetic Arc
So jup, I got some traveling to do next summer too
Må dra dit når korona roer seg
There's always a discussion about what Christmas food is better
Ribbe vs Pinnekjøtt
I'm a ribbe person myself, but I live in a pinnekjøtt area
Its mostly what to eat for christmas and there is a lot of other stuff but sadly i dont dont remember gem now
I vote to put onion in
Just got to say, Queens jam (a mix of raspberry and blueberry) is the real hidden secret of Swedish cousine
That is a combo I had not tasted or even heard of up to a few years ago
I had an a-ha moment first time i tasted it
It tastes fantastic
Why isn't that a regular jam in the whole world
It is so delicious
Where I live many people eat boiled cod for Christmas dinner
And I know - it makes absolutely no sense
I prefer Pinnekjøtt
Or the related julebrus-war
(I personally drink neither
And then there are the heretics that eat lutefisk
I will never understand the concept of Juletorsk
Wtf
Or perhaps even worse - Lutefisk
They're crazy
In my family we gather together with a whole lot of extended family and eat juletorsk 1st or 2nd christmas day (depending on what fits the best)
I love the dish, but not for christmas eve
The people I know eating fish for Christmas say it makes room for lots of dessert and cakes later in the evening
My parents are from different parts of the country, so I grew up having both pinnekjøtt and ribbe on Christmas Eve
We have had lots of different things on Christmas Day/2nd day, but never juletorsk
My mom loves lutefisk though
We do the same
The best thing about having juletorsk on the 1st or 2nd is that you can add pinnekjøtt-broth to it
A mix between the Norwegian and English word for Norway/Norge - Norgay
Norge because that’s what we call it and I find non native speakers trying to pronounce it entertaining
I often find myself saying Deutsch when im talking english
It just comes naturally
We call you Hellas, if that's any consolation
TIL: Hrvatska
We can call you 'Full' from now on
In Norwegian you are Ungarn
Would that do
We spell is Tsjekkia
We already call you Estland
And I agree, it has a nice sound to it
How bout 'Kypros'?
Why though
Even in mostly Nynorsk areas, Norge is the most common name in use
We call it Estland
They speak Netherite
> and they speak ‘Netherlands’.
Nederlandish
Unfortunately they still speak Gresk
(Maybe we should start calling it Hellansk
The "iy" combination would be redundant in English
Also, they can't pronounce the final "e".
De er full
Both should have emphasis
nOrEg
But I disagree that Norway should change in English, as the English version is closer to the original meaning of the word than the Norwegian equivalent(s) are in Norwegian
Ie "the way north".
It's what we do in Norwegian
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Nothern Ireland is Det Forente Kongerike Storbritannia og Nord-Irland and the short version is just Storbritannia
It’s the same in Norwegian: øster - east, rike - kingdom/empire
Try typing in "Noreg" here
Type in the more common word for Norway "Norge". That has a clear emphasis on the first vowel
But perhaps you're right that there's more emphasis on the first vowel also in "Noreg".
To be fair "Leif" is a pretty normal name in Norway, even though it's not a very popular one now
I just said it out loud with Danish pronunciation
No, it doesn't work very well in Danish
[Does this count
I do not
I own a single t-shirt with a Pingo print, otherwise I avoid any type of logo or design on the front
I tend to wear solid colours in a darker pallet, with very limited pattern
I like to play with length/layers and mismatching textiles to create texture
Why would I pay to advertise a brand
Is it just so people will know what brand I'm wearing  and thus how much I spent on said item
I think it's ugly and tacky
But I understand that a lot of people don't agree, and that's fine
In Norway, probably every person wears this
I dont know a single teenager who doesnt wear gant, levis, Nike, adidas, polo, etc
As long as they are not too big or imposing, I don't really care
As long as it is comfortable and looks half-decent
Same here
Plus, I don't want to be some kind of walking advertisement
I’d probably fall on the UK, granted it’s been a few years since I’ve been there but the last time I was in London, (which was also the first mind you) gave me a feeling of a kind of superiority
A lot of employees you could classify as “home-grown brits” looked down on me for not speaking with a perfect English accent even though as someone else in this thread said that most brits are monolingual
And though the tube was efficient, the map showing where the lines go are
Really confusing if you’re just taking a quick glance to get an idea of where you want to go
But to hack on another country other than the UK I would probably call out my home country of Norway
Especially after COVID hit, I’ve lost all confidence in our current government and feel that other European countries handle the situation at least a bit better than we do, plus’s it’s expensive as hell to live here so, you know
Edit: most brits seem like they’re monolingual, it’s just pulling everyone under the same comb to say none of you are
Do they really project a different image
I’ve never been to Athens, but I’ve always heard Athens is big, dusty, hard to get around in and unappealing
I’ve figured there’s a reason why most people have never been there, compared to other big Mediterranean cities
I would love to go one day though
> In my view only snow-white albino people lived there
Side-note: I recently talked to someone about Seattle
Because Seattle has the same size population as Oslo
And about the same amount of people with African descend
He blamed the black for all the problems in Seattle, so I asked him to explain why Oslo doesn't have the same problems as Seattle
In 2019 there were 7500 break-ins in Seattle
500 in Oslo
So 15 times (!) more in Seattle
Meaning the skin colour of the people in the two cities can't explain it
> the UK can be more efficient in many areas,
This is the test: how long can it take to evict a tenant who has stopped paying rent
In the UK it can take up to 6 months
How long does it take in Germany
I really loved Paris when I visited
In many ways it was everything I imagined
But I had watched very few French films
I love London but I really feel like it’s an acquired taste
British architecture and city planning is very unique
The first time I went I thought it was a quite ugly city especially due to all the brown bricked buildings (seriously why is every damn building in the entire UK brown
), but now I don’t think it’s ugly at all
Free Church people
I am guessing that is some sort of religious group
We have some small conservative religious groups that are judgemental nutcases, unfortunately
But I would say in general most people do not give a shit who you live with
The Free Church is shit
I'm sorry your stay was ruined by that kind of people
Where in Norway were you
I mean, there are a lot of deeply religious people in smaller towns, I won't lie, but this seems wild
I've never, *never* heard anyone experience something like that, and my closest relatives give 20% of their income to their evangelical church, we're they talk in tounges and have endless number of kids
Their own kids, several of them, lived with their partners before getting married
No one battered an eyelid
People living together outside marriage is very normal
Over half of children in Norway are born outside marriage
Also I just wonder, where is it you encounter these people
On social media
Work related
I dont think Ive ever heard someone say living together outside marriage is bad
> Wait, every french family has its own washing machine and dryer
Only for people in apartment buildings share in Switzerland I assume
In my previous apartment, we had a washing machine for sharing in the basement where we had to pay with a special card and stuff
It worked out fine, but now I live in an apartment with my own washing machine (in the bathroom, which is the most common
Some houses have its own washing room), and it's soooo much better
No extra paying, no scheduling, don't have to go out of my apartment to do so etc
I dont remember there being any major protests against covid regulations here
But we dont have very strict regulations
I visited paris about 20 years ago when I was around 12 so I wasn't old enough to have any romanticised view of Paris
The city was extremely dirty, there were homeless people living under every bridge, and as I was waiting a bit away from my family an adult man started chatting me up in french
0/10 will never go there again
I would dare say that it's probably the same here as in Sweden
Like every country, we also have a *small amount* of religious freaks who judge other people for not living up to their moral standards, but it's by no means common
I used to live in northern Sweden
I asked some old Swedish friends what they thought of Sweden's approach to covid around the time it started to become clear the countries approach wasn't succeeding, and they got incredibly offended and defensive
I was polite, honestly just trying to gauge their opinion of the situation, and how things were in the town i used to live in, but it seemed to really hit a nerve
Edit fixed a few mistakes, made it a bit clearer
May I suggest you try the fjordier brother as well
[Here] are [two] examples from Oslo
I love London, red bricks and all
People who complain about London or Paris, or other big cities have wrong expectations in my opinion
I am a country girl, but there are things found in cities you cannot find elsewhere
(Love the museums)
Yeah you were unlucky somehow getting mixed up in a sect crowd
I’m in Oslo and I know very few religious people, not to mention extremists
Though I have heard about those denominations, so they definitely exist
Im sorry to hear that
Those people are really stepping out of their boundaries trying to tell you what to do
I’ve taken the green line LOTS of times, my wife’s family lives on one of the stops near Piraeus, and I’ve never had any trouble at all
And I look very foreign when we visit
Maybe it’s because I’m with an insider, but I have never felt unsafe on the Athens metro
I also find the history of smog interesting
I heard a story yesterday when one day people couldn't see their feet because the smog was so bad
Very true
My fostermoms last name is Larsen :)
Yes, in Norway the most common surnames are all patronymic-style, but most people have a surname based on a place name, commonly the name of a farm some ancestor came from
I'm a teacher, and I just checked the list of names for one of my classes
Twenty of the students have clearly Scandinavian last names, and of those, only four end in -sen or -son
I'd say that's fairly typical
Had a friend in primary school who's parents were named Petersen and Pettersen
Only kept one for my friend though
Edit
Not what you're thinking about, but fun anyways
Not at all
Not only is English easy for Norwwgians to learn but the alternatives are worse
Either a completely different language like Chinese would dominate or we wouldn't have a dominating language effectively forcing us to learn a lot more languages
Yes
I hate how it infiltrates much of the Norwegian language, especially among the youth and my generation
I'm a student at a university and I correct mandatory exercises, and people often write a horrible mixture of English and Norwegian
It just seems really awkward and a bit pretentious, especially when there are well known Norwegian words for what they are mentioning
I love it
It’s not that hard to learn and about everyone talks it
Under certain circumstances it is indeed annoying
For example, when arrogant foreigners come to our country and expect (sometimes even demand) local people to speak English for their benefit
Implicitly, their behaviour sends the message "I insist on being in your country even though I do not value your language and culture at all
Cater to my preferences at all times
". Sometimes this results in absurd behaviours, like waiters at a restaurant (that are themselves clearly not native speakers of English)  acting like you are in the wrong for attempting to ask questions or make an order in the local language, or door sellers and charity muggers attempting to push stuff/beg for money without expressing themselves in the local language
No, absolutely not
i think it’s useful and the world needs a common language
my personal belief is that there should be two levels to language, the single unified common language to the world that (hopefully one day) everyone knows
and the myriad of small, regional languages that should be protected as cultural treasures
I'm just thinking: Thank goodness its not German
Their grammar is horrendous
But German would obviously still be better than Polish
Or Finish
I love the English language, I grew up with it alongside Norwegian
No, we need a lingua franca
But I do resent the nonsensical use of English by my own countrymen
E.g. when shops put up posters with "sale" on, or when artists name their works in English
Sweden: No
Finland: No
Russia: Yes - our fighters intercept Russian military aircraft violating our airspace on a weekly basis, and have done so for decades
So maybe it's not a fear of an invasion, but they certainly "rattle their sables" to put it that way
Their electronic warfare against Norway is also very unsettling
Russia is also testing "our seas"
I know someone who worked at the coast guard for years and the amount of times they would discover unauthorized russian ships/submarines lurking in our ocean claiming they "didn’t know" is annoying
A friend who was in the military up north for some time also told me that Russia sends threats to Norway more times than he could count
I can of course not confirm if this is true for sure, but honestly, if there is a country that would poke anyone with a stick, it’s Russia
Well, Norway's northernmost areas contain NATO's monitoring systems, observing all traffic to and from the Russian military bases in the Murmansk area, and we have for decades been NATO's ears and eyes towards that sector of the Barents Sea, and we can monitor the submarine traffic in and out of those waters better than any other NATO country and have done so since the start of the cold war
Since we also "own" Svalbard, we monitor this from two sides at the same time making it very hard for any submarine to slip into the Atlantic without us knowing
Of course, the Russians are not pleased about this, and have shown their displeasure by sending military aircraft of various types towards Norwegian territorial waters, expecting Norwegian fighters to intercept them before they enter said waters
They send [everything from MIG 29's to TU-95 (bear) strategic bombers and more]
I believe that it is mostly to keep us on our toes, and make a statement that they do not like our monitoring activities, but there has been at least one simulated exercise including naval vessels, submarines and aircrafts simulating an invasion of Norway
We're not overly worried about it, although maybe we should be, but we do trust that us being a NATO country keeps Russia from doing anything stupid
Well, the NATO exercise's purpose is twofold
One - to train on how to defend Norway against any invasion, and two - general training of NATO troops in harsh conditions
There is a big difference between training on how to invade and training how to defend ourselves should we ever be invaded
Well, the NATO exercise's purpose is twofold
One - to train on how to defend Norway against any invasion, and two - general training of NATO troops in harsh conditions
There is a big difference between training on how to invade and training how to defend ourselves should we ever be invaded
But can they be moved further away I wonder
A good friend in the norwegian marine is very worried
Well, that's why we're not too worried about it for the most part
The big commotion was as I said when the Russians played out a full blown invasion exercise in the Barents sea training on how to invade Norway
There were some political fallout after that
Land based radars, no
Out in the Barents Sea, yes most certainly
What they have done though is to distort GPS signals in the Northernmost parts of Norway, which actually disrupts civilian air traffic as well
[Please have a look at this article for more information
Well, yes they do conduct such exercises in Canada as well (Not Greenland to my knowledge) but that's the nature of NATO - if you are to train on how to defend Norway, you should train on Norwegian soil
And I thought it could be interesting for you to see how the Norwegian Military views this situation, so[here is an article posted by Geir Hågen Karlsen] who is a Lieutenant Colonel at the Norwegian Defense College
One quote from the article:
" Russia is the foreign state that tries to influence European politics and decision-making most, and more so than China and other states
These influence activities support three main Russian strategic objectives: regime security, predominance in Russia’s near abroad, and world-power status for Russia
The long-term objective of Russian influence activities is to weaken NATO and the EU
Everything Russia does, whether it is electronic surveillance, influencing elections or conducting military exercises are all tools to meet the aforementioned goals
It is a very good article, and I do recommend it
Just to add on this:
2017: [All commercial aircraft lost GPS signals for a week's time due to Russian GPS jamming]
2018: [several planes lost GPS signals due to Russian jamming during a Russian exercise]
2018: [Air ambulance lost GPS signals 250km from the border]
2019: [More jamming] "The Barents Observer reported that new radio-electronic warfare systems had been installed along Russia's Arctic coast
The systems can jam foreign ships, drones and aircraft thousands of miles away
2020: [Widerøe pilots frustrated about loosing GPS signals due to jamming] "The problem of jamming signals in the northernmost parts of Norway is becoming routine"
Not really, I don't remember the details that vividly
[The Russian training incident happened in 2015] (Invading Northern Norway, Åland, Gotland and Bornholm), and there was another one in 2017 where they trained on[an invasion of Svalbard] Finally,[there was an incident last year] where Russian naval and air forces trained further west and south along the Norwegian coast than ever before
I believe that those articles can shed some light and answer your question
The links are to auto-translated versions of the web pages, they are written in Norwegian but Google is getting better at translating Norwegian so I hope it isn't too bad
Russia's interest in Northern Norway is mostly military in nature
As I said Murmansk is Russia's only ice free port towards the Atlantic basin, and Russia is not happy with the way Norway can monitor their military buildup, submarine traffic etc
I can not document this, but I have heard that the Russian invasion plan was to cut Norway in half, leaving southern Norway alone (that is where most people live, and also where most of the industry in Norway is with the exception of some fish farming etc
Their play would be that the cost of re-gaining Northern Norway would be way too high compared to the industries and income we have from that part of the country
But again - it is unsubstantiated, although my source is a normally very well informed one
You are right, and also the NATO response (don't forget that the current Secretary General of NATO is Norwegian) ;) hehe
Does Québec-French count
(I'm half French-Canadian)
While not me directly, I have family members on my Norwegian side that speak Sami
Not a lot of people here learn Sami, I'd assume only samis learn Sami in school
I can understand Swedish spoken and written, but I can’t write or speak it
I can understand written danish, but spoken is a bit more difficult to understand
Its pertty commen to understand sweedish and be able to read danish in Norway :)
Im pretty shure sweedish people have no truble with norwegian either
I havent talked with that many danes, but they can probably understand sweedish and norwegian too
Yes, I just speak english when Im wisiting
But it helps that written danish is pretty easy to read though
Right now some friends are in denmark, the ferry has been canceld due to the storm
Hopefully it calm down tomorrow :)
Wouldn't that still technically count as a minority language
A quite large minority, yes, but still less than the rest of the country
Though given that this is a European-centric subreddit, I wondered if it was still relevant
I mean yeah, but how is that relevant
I'm well aware of what Québécois is, as I speak it myself
I know it's not it's own language
We're talking about how Québécois is a minority language in Canada because the majority of Canadians speak English
We have the largest proportion of electric cars in the world, and most of our energy comes from hydroelectric dams, so we're possibly the cleanest country in the world as well
But the money to build and maintain those dams we get from selling filthy oil to the rest of the world
Probably that oil will run out someday and that it's not sustainable
Also that while we produce 98% clean electricity, we export most of it, and then we import electricity from EU, which is around half fossile fuels
So the electricity that we put into those cars are what's called EU-mix, which is around 46% derived from fossile fuel [[Article in Norwegian] The net result is that the power we consume is around 40% non-renewable
As a Norwegian I'm probably guilty of this myself
I'm somehow super optimistic about our national team, and to be honest I have some reason for it
With all the good youth players we are producing at the moment
But at the same time we've failed and stumbled right before the finish line so many times now, and it's been 20 years since we last competed in a tournament
Would be interesting if we both meet in the play off final
Scotland having as big of a drought in Euro/WC participation as us I wonder if both of us are still going to find a way in not qualifying even if we meet in the final :/
I live in Norway and we complain a lot
It's just part of our nature I think
I mean - we are probably in the top 5 when it comes to living standards
Still we complain
We complain about our politicians, our health care, our roads, our elderly care, our school system
And if people find nothing else to complain about - they complain about the weather
I believe every single Norwegian should travel to a poor part of the world, at least once in their lifetime
Coming back they might complain less
I'm watching a Netflix series at the moment called "Diagnosis". It's about people in the US who has been trying for years to get a diagnosis to their rare disorder
But, while being sick, or having a sick child, they also have to deal with doctors suing them for unpaid medical bills, lower income due to the sickness (and denied disability money due to lack of a diagnosis), plummeting credit score and a mountain of unpaid hospital bills
Which comes on top of the worries for the person who's health is deteriorating
And I can relate, since my son has been to the hospital 5 times this year
But at least we don't have to give any thought to the finances since out out of pocket costs are $0, which includes the medicine he now gets twice a day
And the worries for your child's health is a heavy burden to carry, so how people survive mentally having the financial worries on top of that is hard to grasp
> The net result is that the power we consume is around 40% non-renewable
well as long as we *make* some renewable energy, surely who consumes it must be irrelevant
> I’d rather pay the uni directly
And health care
What is happening now is that we produce green energy, and then companies and persons in f.ex
Germany buy it
Then we feel good about ourselves for producing green energy while using non-renewable, and they feel good about themselves for buying green energy while producing non-renewable
My point is that we can't have our cake and eat it too
>You should do it even more, as Norwegian hydro is the only inexpensive way to deliver flexible, cheap, and low-carbon electricity
Of course, but right now we only produce around 140 TWh/yr and we consume around 130YWh/yr, so if we were to take all the hydro-electricity for ourselves, there would be only a negligible amount available for export
Our contribution in an international context is tiny
At least Portugal is a pretty damn good side, you're reigning champions
We've not been in a tournament for 20 years and will meet two World Cup semi finalists if we qualify
At least we should be able to compete with Czechia for 3rd
Nah I'm just messing with ya, it's da boys in green
Has to be Rangers
One example from my own life; My son has been to hospital 5 times this year
Including 4 ambulances, 1 ambulance helicopter, 1 surgery, 1 MRI, 2 EEG, 1 CT, medicine twice a day for 6 months (and ongoing), follow ups at the hospital, numerous blood tests and more
Living here the total out of pocket costs for it all is $0
What would it have cost you in out of pocket cost with your kind of insurance
(If you don't have children, lets pretend this happened to you instead of your child)
I know a little about the history of Egypt, Carthage, the Caliphates, and the "Barbary states", but not as much as I would like
I know a little about your situation now (on the whole, not that great), and your culture and ethnic makeup
But given that we get most of our knowledge from entertainment media (not school, as some people think), I probably know more about New Jersey than the whole of North Africa put together
It doesnt feel like we are related
I would say we are more related to the USA considering they are descendants of Europeans mostly
I know too little I'm afraid
I have learned though that Egypt is vastly different than Europe when it comes to culture, traditions and way of living
Which I find very fascinating since the country is located so close to Europe
Yet Europe seems to have had almost no influence at all
Since Egypt is such a popular tourist destination I expected the rest of the world to have more influence I guess
A friend travelled around Morocco alone some years ago
She says she LOVED being there
People were super friendly and she never felt like she was in any danger - in spite of being a woman travelling alone
Also the food was very nice she says
Edit: And such an interesting topic
Thank you for posting
Honestly next to nothing
Then again, the north pole is as far away from where I grew up as the middle of algeria
My experience:
I learned a bit about ancient Egypt in school
In French I learned about French  speaking countries in Africa, (mainly Algeria)
And in history we learned about colonization
But that’s about it
I in Norway way know enough about the countries
But I don’t know enough about a lot of European countries either
It’s a shame
I don't know much about North Africa and Africa in general, I don't consider the region to be Europe but many do
I just know that most of you speak Arabic, are Muslim, have desert and have hot weather
Well, it is far
Would actually prefer the civil war over the Viking age, seems like a more interesting time period for an AC game
I live in Norway so I guess that's already happening (sort of), even if AC: Vallhalla is apparently going to to be mostly in the British isles rather than Norway
I would say that either in Viking times or in ww2 occupation
Maybe the time of King Harald Hardråde and the invasion of Britain in 1066
If not that, I guess Valhalla will do
Hope they do this next
Viking is happening
Yeah, but I've heard it's mostly as a viking in the UK and not in Scandinavia :(
Accidentally
Isn’t it a chrismas movie
Tři oříšky pro Popelku is the Norwegian tradition, it's kinda a surprise for me that it's not that for you
Say what now
Østfoldinger
Rånere
Navere: people on welfare (Nav is the Norwegian welfare administration)
Harryfolk: particularly uncultured people (the name Harry, for some reason, has become an adjective meaning uncultured, unsophisticated, vulgar)
Tryhard rednecks
Bondeknøll
Basically same for Norway except we call them 'Rånere'.
It is fun to hear that fanaticism is linked to lower class, just like the stereotypical Jesus loving rednecks of Texas
Every Turk I personally know in Norway, 2nd gen or above, has higher education
It's the easy access to Swedish alcohol prices no doubt
I think it comes down to not having much else to do than drinking and being into cars
Having a car also becomes a lot more important the more remotely you live
While people absolutely still are into cars and there are enough shitfaced kids burning rubber, it feels like the entire phenomenon of the "classic" raggar is a bit past its heyday
The proper old school ones you see now appear to be pretty organised and proper
I know someone with a table like this
I had no idea, but this fits right in
I guess they can be a bit like that, but the families of both my friends are very secular, and have intermarried with Norwegians
You should check out a turkish band called Altin Gün. It modern turkish synt pop/disco inspired by the psychedelic and progressive rock of 70s. It's incredible
Do you find some Norwegian dialects easier or harder to understand
What about Finnish and other Uralic languages
"Nice to meet you
How are you doing
" – Did I get that right
Oh, nice
I'm a little proud of myself now, ha ha
Word for word it would actually be quite similar in Norwegian:
*"Gaman å kynnast med deg
Korleis har du det
Written using more old fashioned orthography it would look something like this:
*"Gaman å kynnast med dér. Korleîs hev du dat
You might notice that the more old fashioned example is slightly closer to Icelandic
However, this is a strange choice of words, so it would be much more natural to say it like this instead:
*"Hyggjeleg å møta deg
Korleis har du det
I didn't recognize the Icelandic word *hvernig* either, but it made sense based on the context
It seems to be a bit more closely related to the less common word *korso* (common in spoken Norwegian, but rarely seen in writing), which developed from Old Norse *hversu*, but in it's modern form, any previous similarity between them is pretty much unrecognizable
>"Hyggjeleg" also sounds like the Icelandic word "Huggulegt", which means "cozy".
That's basically what it means in Norwegian too, but it's a bit difficult to translate perfectly into English
It's a pretty common term, so it can mean different things depending on the context
Maybe this applies to Icelandic as well
>Møta also sounds more like something influenced by english
Møta- meet
Just a thought
Interesting idea, but I'm afraid you are wrong here
It's actually from Old Norse *mœta*, which might be familiar to you since it still exists in Icelandic, but perhaps it's not as common in Icelandic
Edit: I forgot to add this, but since English is also a Germanic language, it's just a coincidence that it's also kept the same word from Proto-Germanic, but it doesn't appear to have been borrowed from English to Norwegian or vice-versa
The Norwegian *møta* is also used similarly to how you used it in your example sentences, e.g. "Eg møtte klokka åtte" is also a valid sentence in Norwegian
>And also you got me thinking, maybe møta and meet have the same origin-  mæta
Since Old Norse significantly influenced English
I'm no linguist  but I think it might makes sense
I looked into it, but it seems that the word just survived independently in English, Norwegian and Icelandic
Norwegian and Icelandic obviously got it from Old Norse, English kept it from Old English, but all three languages are Germanic languages and have had the word since Proto-Germanic, so about 2000 years ago, it would be *mōtijaną*. Obviously it's changed a lot since then, and it changed differently in each language
>Also one question as I was trying to look this up some days ago but  found nothing
Many people have told me that northern Norwegians, mostly  older people have no difficulty speaking to Icelanders
Speaking as a person from Northern Norway, the answer is no
When I hear Icelandic spoken, I can usually only make out a little bit of it
I don't think my older relatives would find it much easier
However, there are some western Norwegian dialects, particularly in the Sogn area, which has a lot of similarities to Icelandic
I believe that's where most of the original Icelandic settlers came from, and they brought their dialect with them
For reference, here are two clips: The first one is of a person from Northern Norway, and the other is of a person from Hafslo, deep in the Sognefjord in Western Norway
Which one do you understand best, if at all:
[Hafslo, Western Norway]
[Bjarkøy, Northern Norway]
You can also try listening to [this clip] from Setesdal, in Southern Norway
It's often often considered one of the most conservative Norwegian dialects, so I'm curious about how much you'd understand
In the good old days I believe an axe was used
There are also accounts of people being executed by being put in a barrel and pushed down a cliff
In more recent times, it was by gunfire
Axe
Blood eagle
Your ribs are split opened down your back, lungs are pulled out and placed on your shoulders, then you stayd like that until you died
If you screamed or showed pain during the ritual, you wouldn't reach Valhalla
Bloodeagle
Yeah, the last execution for a non-war crime (murder) was in 1876 and was indeed decapitation by axe
Last war crime (treason) execution was by firing squad in 1948
As for the "weird" techniques there was indeed drowning, burning, and the [breaking wheel ] used
Please, educate us
Obviously English is mandatory and at least in my school we started having English class in English in videregående (upper secondary school/high school)
I don't know if this counts but since we have two writing systems, most have to learn some of the non-standard system for your municipality (e.g. I had to learn nynorsk bc here we write in bokmål)
Though that's written language, not spoken
Other than that you usually do the usual choosing between French, Spanish or German (or more English if you struggle)
In uni about half of my classes have been in English I'd say (though I've no idea if this is only my study area or not
I study linguistics)
But other than that, classes in all schools are in Norwegian, unless you go to a specific school that teaches in say French or Farsi or Urdu
not any really
Maybe the Samer (native people) up north, but I have never heard any serious takes on this
They have it pretty good with tax breaks and other benefits, so I bet they are not complaining
There is even a [movement] dedicated to digging Scania away from the mainland completely
penis and piss
both are tiss
Teppe - carpet and blanket
Vote, voice, something's right and to tune is stemme in norwegian
Stutter, to derive from, tribe and tree trunk is stamme in norwegian
in a spoken sense we have the same, but written differently
måne - moon
måned - month
depending on the dialect the d is silent
Same in norwegian, "drage"
same here "gift" (which means both poison and married lol)
but im pretty sure making that difference is pretty rare and english is the weird one
Also "to pull".
Pull is "å dra" and "å trekke".
Du kan no bøye ordet dra å sjå kva du får.
OK school systems
Physically close to UK and with historic relations
Very similar languages that makes learning English easy
Small countries with limited availability of stuff in their own languages
Dutch and the Scandinavian languages are very similar to English
One simple, but important thing is sentence structure which is close to similar
This makes the grammar kind of intuitive for the most part, with some exceptions
We learn it in school, but i think a big reason now is because of the internet, everyone uses it and theyre bound to come across a lot of English there
I think 2 and 3 are less important considering how well the Finns do
I hope we never start dubbing even if we get large
I think it's a result of the other four
More dubs mean less availability of original content some of the time
Mostly in cinemas
If there was a Norwegian version of Final Fantasy 8, I probably would have played that
But instead I had to learn English
That's more or less number 4 of my original list, but I didn't intend to make it a ranking :)
"This guy are sick" from VII was certainly helpful in learning the whole is/are thing
Country then region
I've got relatives from all over the country and feel at home anywhere in Norway
City first, then country
Oslo being the only true big city in the country, in many ways it feels different than anywhere else in the country
Being a big (ish) city brings both benefits and challenges that you won’t find anywhere else in the country, and this is often completely lost on people not living here, instead they will just simplify it as «Oslo think they’re the centre of the world” when anything unique to Oslo is brought up
I still very much identity as Norwegian though
Norway first and foremost, then to people from my area/region I may use my home village more, although not many has actually heard of it
My region doesn't really have much regional pride or anything so that's not something most identify with
Nation first, and the island I am from second, and that is a strong second
It is kind of weird to say this, but it is almost like a calling, I tried to live on Dovre a while (high on the mountain) but I yearned back to the sea and to the island, same thing happened when I visited Czhech Republic and England, but that was more for the nation
Agree
Bergen does that to you
That's interesting
Kaffi, kahveli and hantuuki translated to my Norwegian dialect is "kaffi", "gaffel" and "håndduk" ("handduk" in other dialects)
Cartoon tv, books, games, being with friends, Donald Duck, smoke bombs, drawing, football
Me and a friend built a fort out of planks and rocks, which was moved between three locations over the span of five or six years
We were massively into medieval stuff, and my dad even made us swords and shields out of wood and leather
When we reached our teens, however, we started gaming more
Fifa, World at War and 007: Nightfire mostly
I miss those days, but they're good memories
Watching cartoons, playing with barbies, reading books and comics
Also making my own comics
Playing habbo hotel  and other online games
Waching TV, playing computer games, videogames, go swimming in a small lake, playing around in the woods, climbing trees, jumping on the trampoline, cycling around, driving around with a electric scooter or skateboard (with a very week motor), just hanging with friends and do all kinds of stuff, o and making snowcaves
Edit: I'm from Northern Norway btw
Pronounciation, funnily enough
I always almost either lisp the C or say pro-NOUN-ciation
Anything ending with '-dy' or '-ly'. 'Tragedy' for instance
Subtlety
I can say it if I speak freely, but if I have to read that shit you’ll hear sub-t-let-y
‘Earth’ always becomes either ‘eeff’ or ‘ørt’ for me
Also, as a conductor, if I tell the band or choir to play ‘thirds’ it always comes out as ‘turds’.
Thrice
The r sound when it comes right after the "th" sound is very difficult here, even though "three" is simple enough to say
"Clothes". I consider my English to be good enough that I could pass for a native speaker (for a couple of sentences), but "clothes" wrecks both my brain and my tongue
It ends up as either "close" or a complete trainwreck of a word that sounds more like "cloths".
Somewhat ironically for someone with a Google home, "Ok, Google". I always stumble saying it
I wish you could change it to something easier like "Halla Hjørdis
That was my first thought as well
Words like this that are stressed weirdly (and not used that often), or words that are similar to Norwegian but stressed differently, like "par**en**thesis" ("paran**tes**" in Norwegian)
As an Oslogutt, archipelago is my nemesis when i'm trying to explain our fjordlandskap to foreigners
oh god please have mercy
Asked my french friend to say focus and she sounded like a scot saying "fock us" legit dead
[This comes to mind]
[Phenomenon
du-du du-du-du
PHENOMENON
Du-du du du~]
Actually it is "Parentes"
Haha bilingual here
I was reading all the words here to see how people find it difficult, and then I see hyperbole and said hyperbowl
Took way to long to hear the correct pronunciation when I was young, and apparently the mispronounciation still lingers
Reminds me of hegemony
Pronounced something like Hedge-eh-mehni, but for the longest I said hedge-a-moany
How else would you pronounce it
Those are difficult
Come on
Here, let me show you how easy it is:
Rrr
Rrrr
Hmm
They are pronounced the same, but «beach» is longer
But I’m not surprised Catalan or Spanish speakers might have trouble with this, since a big difference between those languages and English is that English has varying vowel lengths while Catalan/Spanish does not
Odd
my spellchecker didn't strike out on it
it would explain a whole lot
Sure, it's not a big issue, and the problem is usually that the flow is lost mid-sentence if there's a word I know how to stress, but have to process consciously first
Mate we call bags, like shopping bags, 'pose' (pronounced poo-seh) and sausage is called 'pølse' (pronounced Pøl-seh, the ø sound is akin to the o in 'touch'), and when you're in a supermarket, the bags are behind the counter and the cashier asks you if you want a bag by just saying 'pose
', and my aussie mate deadass thought they were asking him if he wanted sausage with his purchase for a good three months when he just moved here lmaoo he was like ew no thank you
if you mean dropping to dg- and only say g, then yes, that is okay
The way that I wrote it is the way I have always heard it being pronounced however
But is that actually how anyone would pronounce it
Wouldn’t that first s just be silent or are you actually meant to pronounce it
Having been to Finland and Japan, they don't feel similar at all
And before someone else steals my bad joke, Germany and Argentina
As for Norway
Can't really think of any
Japan feels oddly similar to all the Nordic countries, in a very uncanny way
I love Japan, which I have visited twice, and it seems to me like some sort of ScandiAsian Twilight sone
It's not really about the culture, but the aesthetics
The use of wood and ceramics, and the focus on design and crafts makes it sometime impossible to distinguish between a ramen bar in Tokyo or a coffee bar in Stockholm
And add to that, both regions/countries are rather close on the [Inglehart-Welzel cultural map]
I have never visited Australia or New Zealand, but whenever I meet someone from those two countries there's for some reason a cultural similarity that feels stronger than the one towards the UK
It probably has something to do with the existing close ties between the Nordic region and the anglosphere combined with a preference for unformality and classlessness that we do not find in the UK
Hmmm, maybe Greece for their metal bands
Minnesota does have a lot Norwegian-Americans, and I do like the Minnesota Vikings
Also, Pepsi is our national drink
Canada has the second-highest number of Norwegian descendants after the US, and the weather is similar
New Zealand
They seem to be aware of their relative insignificance, but they're still a very nice little country, with some very nice nature
Norway and New Zealand, despite being about as far away from each other as physically possible on this earth, it was weirdly familiar when I visited
Though that was after I spent almost 5 months in Australia on exchange
Canada is apparently not all that different from the Scandinavian countries
I haven't been there, but from what i hear of canada through news and people talking about it, it really feels like the North American Scandinavia
I kind of get it
They are both composed kind of people
They both like to stand nicely in lines without anyone trying to cheat
They like their personal space
But work culture is of course vastly difference, and for instance the view on mental illness I would say is much more healthy in Finland
I’m thinking Canada and Norway for some reason
This was my first thought
The kids aren't "Americanised" they're just swedish
Minnesota would also be a good choice
For the nature, Alaska is more similar
Damn I'm very good at observing if a picture is taken in Norway, I just find something unique about our landscape and flora
But this really does look like Norway, if you didn't tell me I would probably mistake it as from here
What little they have kept is mostly of a culture from long ago
It's also very much watered down with general American culture
I did my exchange there
It really is sweet
It's like a time capsule from the past
Also, the Minnesota Vikings and their war chant is truly unique
I would say Seiland national park
I would say its one of the most beautiful areas in northern norway
Its not really unique but its the closest thing to it
There's plenty of fjords and mountains where I live, but there's nothing unique to that - there's fjords all over Norway
But one of the things that tourists often overlook when they visit Norway is the skerries - the tens of thousands of small islets that's scattered all along the coast, and protects the coast from harsh weather
The skerries have been used by farmers for grazing since the bronze age, and is a truly unique landscape
[Lygra] is a a part of a bigger island just north of the city of Bergen, where I live
It's not spectacular, because all the islands are truly spectacular
It's just a good example of that particular landscape
Close by, perhaps [Magalaupet]
A little further away, there’s [Torghatten] which with the right timing, you can watch the sun shine through the mountain
We got the worlds strongest tidal current [Saltstraumen] (20 min drive), the view from our bedroom window [Børvasstindan] coincidentally above Saltstraumen
[Keiservarden] (Emperor's Cairn), named in honour of Kaiser Wilhelm II who visited it in 1891, it has a [wonderfull view] of the city and the surrounding landscape, and on clear days you can even see the Lofoten "wall" way way in the distance
There's a lot of nice mountains around Tromsø. To name a couple that are spectacular
Hamperokken 1404 m [
&#x200B;
Store blåmann 1044 m
Something cozy about taking a hike on top of the mountains
Its really nice with the fresh air and the nature
Privacy
I’ve heard some stuff about privacy problems regarding zoom, but I never really knew what they were
Thank you, this makes much more sense
A friend of mine who lives abroad got his entire zoom chat hacked while he was having a class by some Vietnamese guys and they started speaking French
The teacher just responded to all of it by leaving lol
We have a small town called Hell
If you take a plane to Trondheim, you will land in Hell
We have Hell as an «international» one
Other small ones I found:
Møkkalasset = «big pile of shit»
Ræva = «the ass»
Tissvassklumptjønnin = «piss water lump lake»
Svenskehølet = «the Swedish hole»
Rompeporten = «the gate of the ass»
Drittsekktjønn = «shitbag lake»
Fettavika = «pussy bay»
Lortegrauten = «the shit porridge»
Hell
Literally, it's called hell
We have hell, pretty classic
Hell, Norway
It's worth noting that "hell" in Norwegian actually means "luck"
There’s a Norwegian town called hell, which also means luck in norwegian
i live near a place called The End of the World here in norway aswell
And Hell is less than 1 km away from one of the biggest airports in the country (Værnes)
Why they didn't name it "Hell International Airport" is beyond me
Sædballe is my personal favorite
Also Paradis and Helvete which means hell
ours is named so because when you’re there there’s no land out towards the sea, not until you would hit denmark
I would personally not use those sentences, but I do enjoy poems that happen have a similar phrase or two in them
I don’t magically turn religious, they are idioms and figures of speech
I am not an atheist, but rather agnostic, and although I enjoy the idea of someone watching over me from above - or that I one day might be together with all my lovely pets again
it has less to do with religion and more to do with a “I like this thought” and “it’s a nice way to put it”.
Same; although I'd personally classify myself more of an atheist, I'm not at all militant about it
I don't say religious phrases to people or anything (we're pretty secular, after all), but I still think funeral services in churches are nice
Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable
[Wikipedia]
Atheism, in the broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of deities
Less broadly, atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist
In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities
[Wikipedia]
Which in my mind translates very clearly to the fact that an atheist believe that there is no God
An agnostic person cannot prove that a God exist, nor that he doesn’t exist
An atheist is certain, an agnostic is not
No one can prove it, but an atheist has a clear belief
I genuinely had someone in the US ask me if we rode polar bears to school
I remember it happening three times that they asked directly
\- First was in Paris, which only led to the dude asking whether I wanted to pay in Euro or in crowns (using their exchange rate, which is typically worse for me than what VISA offers)
\- Second was in København: I went to the State Museum of Art, showed my tourist card (which gave discounts) and requested a ticket
Dude muttered something in heavily Danish-accented English even though I'd made an effort to imitate their pronounciation
For the record, Danish tourists and workers I've encountered in my own country always assume that I understand their toungue
I bluntly told him my nationality and that I expected him to speak Danish, which made him relent and say something about "Norwegians always wanting us to speak Danish".
\- Third time was in Berlin, some dude claiming to be from Italia was asking for the way to the Autobahn in accented German
Thing is, he was on the 17th June street, with the Brandenburger Tor behind him and the Siegessäule visible in the distance, plus he had a road map
I suspected he was one of those scammers pretending to be travelling luxury clothing salesmen, so I told him a true story about one I encountered in Roma when I visited that city
At one point he asked where I was from and when I told him he claimed to have visited our capital
No specific questions about the country, though
Depending on the asker, usually something about vikings, football, elves, hipster music, bankers, fucking your cousin
Often people ask too why I don't have a -son patronymic, if they're aware of the Icelandic naming system
While I was studying abroad, my teacher kind of forgot where I was from
I came back from the holidays after visiting my family in Norway and he was like “ah
How was Norway
Or was it Sweden
Nah
pretty sure it was Denmark
Well, *are* you a mafioso
I've had people doubt my Norwegian-ness  just because I'm not blonde
Fucking your cousin
"oh, Norway
Do you know my friend x?"
Sir there are 5 million people here ~~also yes what the fuck how do I actually know them what are the odds~~
Not on the mainland, but I can't speak for Svalbard lol
I totally prefer my polar bear to the reindeer
I mean, I totally prefer riding the polar bear to the reindeer
Yep, I prefer the polar bear to the reindeer
It's annoying, but it was quite weird and unsettling the one time I actually knew the person they were referring to
They were someone who went to the same school as me
Oh yes
It's still snowing
In Oslo we had a little bit of snow in December, none in January
No, I haven't seen snow, but I live pretty far south and near the coast
Currently over 1 metre where I live in Northern Norway
It has been snowing since late October interrupted by mild weather in late December and early January
Yes, but extremely little for the entire winter so far
I don't mind not having to wade through slush and make deals with the devil every time I need to step foot outside, but it is just a bit concerning
The last time it was below essentially 0 here was more than two weeks ago(!) and it hasn't been properly cold even once this entire autumn/winter
Yes
Not as much as last winter and back, but still lots of snow
It’s been a warm winter though, but it’s not my impression that there’s been little snow
Less of it yes, but we’ve still had much snow throughout the winter
Yes, though much of it rained away during the new years storms, then came back over the last week or so
Tromsø is really mild compared to back home in Finnmark, but when it snows here it comes by the meter it seems
Last year we had only a thin layer of snow until well into january in Finnmark, but this year the snow levels have been more normal over there
Trondheim, been snow most days, got it fairly early in october or early november
Some days in January and December with virtually no snow on the ground though which is rather rare, also warm temperatures
Got a lot of a snow a couple days ago but quite a bit of it has rained away
A little bit
Mostly rain tho
Had snow yes, but it's been plus degrees for a month now, so most of it has melted
It's an extremely warm winter though, usually we'll have -5° to -25° at this time of year with a lot of snow
No snow in eastern Norway
1 cm
Melted the next day
It's snowed like 3 days or something this winter
It snowed a fair bit in November though
It kinda feels like we just jumped from november to march
Strangest of all, take a look at this picture I took when I was walking my dog:
This is completely abnormal for a Norwegian January
It's the same here in Norway
Not at all here
That's good
We've only had a little bit of snow here in Trondheim, and for the most part, the temperatures have been like a cold summer day
Not sure I like the development
Depends on where you are
I live in Voss and we've had a couple of days of snow in the lowlands and a lot in the mountains
I'm in Tromsø
I'm from Bergen, and there really has been no sign
That makes sense then
The climate around Bergen is very affected by the warm water coming in from the Atlantic
If you go to the mountains, Oppland/Hedmark or further north, you'll find snow
I saw this just a week ago
Yeah I know, but it's the fact that there usually is snow here
Further north to nordhordaland where my cottage is, there still hasnt been any snow
(It's a countryside unaffected by pollution and climate)
We've had christmas snow there 8 years in a row, so it really is concerning
I have never met a single person that has ever done teleshopping
I haven't seen that on TV for many years
I asked my mom about it and she remembers buying tupperware through teleshopping in the early 2000s.
I remember seing teleshopping shows as a kid where they were selling workout equiptment and such
[Maybe this one
This is King Olav riding the subway to go skiing during the oil crisis of 1973
There was a driving curfew, and in solidarity with the people he used (and paid a ticket for) public transport
The picture reflects one of the most notable qualities of norwegian society, egalitarianism
A bit late to the party, but this picture of Line Nersnæs after the 2011 bombing in Oslo is probably a good contender for this title:
What a great question
Enjoying reading through the comments
I would say this one
Of the UNESCO listed Geiranger fjord
Ok, that made me a bit teary-eyed
Love her facial expression
Oooh, that's a good suggestion
Was trying to think of a picture and the only one I came up with was this one of Max Manus and Crown Prince Olav on his return to Norway after WW2:
Was thinking of the same photo
Just wanted to check if someone beat me to it
> The picture reflects one of the most notable qualities of norwegian society, egalitarianism
And may we always keep this foundation of our culture

Citizens of microstates, what are some advantages or disadvantages of living in your country
Edited for clarity: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican State
Let a man dream
I like you
I don't know what I expected when I made this post tbh haha
luxembourg has a lot more pop relatively
at 560k vs
460k for malta
and i don’t see what you mean with estonia, it has almost tripple the pop
and finally the term "microstate" refers to the small area, not necessarily population
No, you're not a microstate
Let's see who is going to answer from the Vatican
based on what i could find a microstate is best defined as a sovreign state that has sacrificed some of its sovereignity to another country to make it economically and politcally viable despite a big demographical and geographical constraint
so this definition makes it so any nation that is tied to another because of small size and population is considered a microstate
so that means nations like monaco, andorra, the vatican and san marino would be considered a microstate
this definition doesn’t include malta however
there is no clear definition to what is considered a microstate, but it’s usually quite clear what is and isn’t. generally the consensus of who the microstates in europe are is Malta, Andorra, San Marino, Vatican, Liecthenstein and Monaco
microstates have a small population and a small land area
and by that i mean very small, cyprus and luxembourg don’t really fit that bill
also also, i have no idea where you get your numbers from, because Cyprus’ population is around 1
1mill
you should do some research before spouting false info

All of the Slavic languages (especially the balkanic Slavic), Romanian and Japanese
I personaly have to say the Sami language and German, they have such a nice ring to it
I always found Swedish to be a beautiful language
(I know
Then you haven’t heard me speaking
But I agree that icelandic flows well
Same here, i remember this clip that aired in between programs on the Discovery channel when i was younger
Hmm
Depends on the regional dialect for me
Some Swedish sound constantly naggy and in a state of dumbfoundedness, which is very annoying
But others sound quite nice
Sorry, but I think brazilian portugese sounds better
In some parts they speak portuguese with more music, they sing the vocals and they have more nasal sounds that sounds a bit french or italian
European portuguese is "harder", more flat - if that makes sense
I can't point out a spesific thing, Swedish sounds very cute and charming
I think it is partly the melody and part the different words you use
You sure about [that
It has a nice tone to it
So do some Norwegian dialects
But overall Swedish wins
Oh god no
/r/murderedbywords
Well, take out kings and focus only on prime minister (and the historical titles who had the same function)
We have had a few foreign ones, mainly from Sweden, Denmark and Germany
Mind you this was all well over 100 years ago
Yes, only our last king was born in refugee in tjhe UK during WW2
If you don’t count an union as occupation Norway has been ruled by foreign monarchs throughout most of it’s history from around the 15th century to our independence in 1905
But Haakon VII and Olav V were born in Denmark so our current monarch Harald V (1991-present) is our first Norwegian-born monarch in a very long time
But luckily Haakon VII was very good at adapting to the Norwegian culture and Olav V was mostly raised in Norway
wasn't he an honorary chief of a native american tribe too
And if we count the royals, the last King Olav V and his father King Haakon VII were danish born
Haakon was the brother of the danish king and was asked to become king of Norway when we got our independence from Sweden in 1905
To add to the whole thing, King Olav V was born in England
Damn, didn't know that
Kongehuset has pretty decent [biographies] for a lot of members of the royal family, including King Haakon, King Olav and Queen Maud
There's also a nice family tree, lol
American teacher tried to teach the whole class that Norway was allied with Germany during WW2
She did not believe me when I said we were occupied
It ended up with the whole class googling everything she claimed to be true that wasn’t in the textbook, because no one believed her anymore
I grew up in the US, so, some of the dumbest things were
In grade school: There's this thing called God that created this thing and that thing
In high school: Scandinavia isn't a part of Europe
I don’t even know her reasoning
I tried telling her about how fought back, but she wouldn’t have it
She just said “I’m the teacher, I have a master in history
I know this, you don’t.”
Me as an exchange student in the US
Nope, she thought we were allied with Germany
She was in fact a history teacher
Maybe even Africans
Yep, they always make so much sense
Hey that’s me
But I’m actually a girl who went to high school in the US
Otherwise, yep that’s me
Haha yeah I wondered why someone would comment here now
I’m back in Norway yes, currently attending university here
It was great in the states
I got some very good friends there, discovered I absolutely love horseback riding, and it’s cliché, I know, but that was one of the best experiences in my otherwise short life
Wouldn’t trade it for anything
Ah I see
Horseback riding is so much fun, I did western riding so barrel races and stuff like that
You should definitely travel when you’re done with your studies (and have enough money of course)
I think I wanna visit countries in Europe first
They still have Beethoven
Except Vienna is trying to steal Beethoven
No, I haven't heard of it
Although my family sorta celebrates it as it's a family member's birthday
It's called Helligtrekongersaften and haven't been celebrated since 1770
A vicar might mention it during mass if it falls to a Sunday, but that's about it
Traditionally it's the day when Christmas decorations are taken down
In medieval times it was often called "old Christmas eve" as a reference to the pagan Jul celebrations
Norse pagans celebrated "Midtvintersblot", the largest feast at the appearance of the first new moon after winter solstice, usually around that time
From Norway, I'd say a line from Arnulf Øverland's poem "Du må ikke sove" (You must not sleep)
*Du må ikke tåle så inderlig vell
den urett som ikke rammer deg selv
(English: You must not be so tolerant of
the injustices that do not befall you)*
The poem was written in 1936, and is about the rise of facism and nazism, and the dangers of inaction and indifference
EDIT - Minor change of the translation
Possibly the opening line from Henrik Ibsen's epic poem *Terje Vigen*:
"Der bode en underlig gråsprængt en på den yderste nøgne ø" (There lived a strange grizzled one on the utmost naked island)
Or Aust-Vågøy by Inger Hagerup:
" De brente våre gårder, de drepte våre menn
La våre hjerter hamre det om og om igjen" (They torched our farms, they killed our men
Let our hearts hammer it again and again)
I thought of this as well
It is iconic, important and often used to cast light upon injustice
This was my first thought, but I think also the poem Til Ungdommen is very well known - especially after the 2011 terror attacks
The full lyrics in a half-bad translation to English [here]
It’s paints a grim picture of being sorrouned by enemies, but fighting back with the belief in humanity and human dignity
Altough an urban fantasy with the trolls and all, "Trollhunter" is a really good depiction of Western Norway, with it showing the dramatic, but almost always cloudy and rainy scenery, and imo very funny and accurate jabs at Norwegian society with the predator hunting commentary and whatnot
Let me see
brutal vikings

Conclusion: no
When I got some dutch friends to try and speak Norwegian, they actually sounded a bit swedish
To be honest, Nederland is like honorary- Scandinavians though haha
I can read an article in Dutch and understand like 80-90%.
Though I did study Dutch a couple of years ago so maybe I'm biased, but to me Dutch looks like a mix of German, English and Scandinavian
There's a bit from Berlin in the Bourne Identity, which isn't too bad
It's a native movie though, not foreign as the question is asking about
But I agree, that movie brought my childhood-nightmares to life haha
Disrespect nature, as in it could probably get you killed
Start a conversation with someone in a bus
It seems like every year there's a story about a tourist dying or needing rescue because they fell off a cliff
How do you fall off a cliff
Cliffs don't move
Stay back from the edge
Also, moose are indeed herbivores, but they can still ruin your whole vacation
Aw, come on, not even the slightest
She's so old now, that her time will come soon anyway
Don’t forget Norway
Ikea is the shit if you’re on a budget
Old Ikea was flimsy as hell, but the later years they’ve started offering sturdier design-like furniture, for uhm
not budget prices
Their budget stuff is still a little weak, but it will fill a house and work for a while, until you can buy other stuff
Ikea food is just normal food
It’s seen as the cheap option, but it is extremely common
Many people pride themselves in not having any furniture from IKEA
So did I, until I bought my bed there
A go to furniture store
Also they have good cinnamon rolls
Bad quality, but so cheap that we still shop there
Norwegian here
Ikea is seen as a cheap and cheerful generic brand that almost everyone buys products from, but definitely isn't seen as being exotic nor a luxury brand
Personally I pick up a lot of kitchen gear, storage and organisational furniture and supplies, candles, plants, and things like shelving
I have also owned a few Billy bookcases in my time
When I was younger (read, broke) most of my stuff was from ikea, but now that I'm older I can afford furniture thats of better quality
Still, that doesn't mean I stick my nose up at the brand, they have a ton of great stuff
Which is why *everybody* has their stuff
As for food, we have diam at the supermarket, so thats not a drawcard either, but their sausages are dirt cheap, and they do chocolate bars for next to nothing (I use them in baking a lot)
Also, good cinnamon rolls
I almost always buy a sausage and a soft drink when at their store
Their food sales must accout for at least a quarter of all sales
I'd say I go once a month to pick up something, as its down the road from me
Last time I popped in for coat hangers and new fitted sheets
Time before that I needed a new vegetable knife and a pot scraper
last bigger purchase was nordli drawers
But generally is smaller odds and ends
I feel like reddit makes Ikea look worse than they are honestly
They have some crap but also some good stuff
I can't really say they are like Herman miller but they aren't trying to be either
I find this an interesting aspect of Germany
I was in a birthday party once (in Norway)
Some close friends of the guy, a German couple, came all the way from Germany to join the celebration
A lot of people made speeches saying nice things about the guy (in Norway there are usually a lot of speeches made in both birthday parties and weddings)
The German guy wanted to say a few words, but before he addressed the guy who's birthday it was, he apologised to all the guests on behalf of Germany for the harm they had caused Norway during the war
It was such a huge surprise, not a single person there (all Norwegians) expected that at all
A very nice gesture, but totally unnecessary (all guests were 40 or younger except the parents of the guy)
But still very nice of him
> The funny thing is they said we are racist
The irony
I'd say it's sad that he felt the need to say anything
He wasn't born, he didn't make any decisions and he has no other connection to the war than being born in the country that started it
I think I'd cringe if I was at that party
> I think I'd cringe if I was at that party
I can't remember cringing, I think we felt more touched by it
And I think (some) Germans still feel responsible - not for causing the war, but for preventing Germany causing another war
Which I think is great
We should all remember the past and try to prevent the bad parts from repeating itself
lmao gotem
We don't really have bases per se, but there are US Marines more or less permanently "training" in inner Troms now
I don't mind, if only to stick it to the Russians
A few hundred Marines stationed 1000 km from the border is an act of aggression apparently, while the Russians can have tanks and nuclear missile subs right on the border, conduct mock attacks on radar sites, and "test" their jammers that disrupt civil aviation in East Finnmark, but even the slightest objection or hint at bolstering our defence in response is NATO imperialist aggression
Bread
Cheese
Strawberries
(Specifically Norwegian ones
The colder weather makes them taste sweeter than the ones grown in warmer climate)
I saw a documentary ones from a small village in Italy
We got to see the food storage of one of the ladies in the village, and oh my gosh all those nice salami looking meets hanging from the ceiling
Very impressive
And rows and rows of jars of canned food
The documentary was about the very long life expectancy in the village, and looking at the food they ate you understood why they seemed to live on forever
Yes
Good tasting tap water is a rather rare thing these days
I have yet to come across any desert that comes even close to proper vienna pastries (it might be called danish in english)
They are without a doubt the most delicious baked goods on earth
> and I had good cheeses from Norway (this sweet brown cheese),
You are a person of excellent taste
Brown cheese is good, but it's not a cheese
We've got other good cheeses though
Feta
Yum
I was once on vacation on a greek island with some friends, and the place we stayed at normally served greek salad as a side dish for lunch
My friends didn't like feta (how is that possible
), so they donated all their cheese to me
Naturally, I didn't protest :-)
We only buy bottled water when we need a bottle (for sports)
I think it is because they spend more time getting ripe, so they have time to develop more taste
But maybe more daylight also plays a role
> Everyone who visits the Nordic countries in summer really should try our strawberries
I agree
Those are the types of issues I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with
Sounds like a hassle
>English food is delicious when compared to scandinavian food
Not a fan of the New Nordic trend in gastronomy
You cant find bread with rice porridge topping anywhere else in the world I'm afraid
>That is a very enthusiastic way to say "bland grub" :D
I don't think the Nordic restaurant scene serves bland food at the moment - on the contrary, the New Nordic trend is a necessary revitalisation of fine dining
> It's the proper rye bread that I dont seem to get elsewhere
Denmark
Not that i have noticed
I only drink polish beer though
A six pack of beer costs around 18 euros here
Why would i pay 18 euros when i can buy a 6 pack of Tyskie for 5 Euros instead
Russia
I've been fascinated with it for quite a while
* Ancient civilizations (which are not Greek/Roman)
* East Russia
* Wars in Europe after 1990
* Colonialism and independence of the latin american countries
* Feudal Japan
These catch my eyes the most at the moment
Ah, so many
But my favourite is probably France
The origin of so many western ideas and modern principles
Philosophers, scientists, and conquerors
Revolution, warfare, and empire
From Vercingetorix, to Charlemagne, to Napoleon
If you think the history of France is too mainstream to be exciting it's only because you haven't dived deep enough
Admiral Yi is one of my most favourite historical characters
Such a badass mastermind
Just one aspect of Korea's fascinating history
Learning about how Japan went from living in a bubble closed off to the outside world to actually catch up with Western powers in terms of development over such a short span of time is incredible
I'm not completely sure
It might be because Russian story wasn't really taught much in school, but I think there's so much history that I think is interesting
Whenever we get a new book about Russia, Russian politics/history or anything in the bookshop I work in, I instantly want to read it
I find that the history of the eastern part of Russia is very interesting
Just looking at maps, reading the stories and history of the places
There is so much i don't know and i have never heard off
Most other parts of the world is quite easy information to gather, but it seems that particular part is rather, bypassed in general history
I would want to hangout in the Americas with Leif Erikson
8th of may 1945, the day we were independent again, after the nazis
The celebrations after that must have been anything like something since
Just looking at footage from the time is out of this world
I don't know what else I would want to see besides things like that as Norway wasn't particularily nice to live in for most of it's history
1263 or 1314
1263 because that's when Norway reached its territorial peak
1314 because, while having slightly less territory, Norway was arguably more powerfull then, than at any other point in the middle ages
1240 - 1319 is what is often said to be regarded as a norwegian golden age, so I suppose any point within those years would be good
Norway
Either from 17
May 1814, seeing the end of 400 years of Danish occupation, or any time between 830-1066
Is that what they named granola bar after
Like an americanised version of the name
"I just arrived in my fantastic boat
Tidenes beste norske sketsj
well i know the names of the swedish and british ones, and i know that the spanish one doesnt have any lyrics
nothing more than that though lol
You have the law of Jante as well
Germany can into the Nordic
Don't agree with that description
Flashing your wealth is not popular and most rich Norwegian families are very mindful about keeping a modest public profile
Then they can go to France and enjoy life
Saw an english speaking guy at a bar trying to pick up chicks  where i live by pouring a bottle of champagne on the floor
The dude almost ended up in a hospital after a group of guys got pissed at his arrogance, and decided that they had consumed enough vodka to sleep a night in the local police station
The bouncers had to escort the guy out of the bar for his own safety
I can understand it somewhat though
Wouldn't you be more prone to flex how far you've come if you grew up poor
And if enough people do that, then it might become the norm, and old money folks find it acceptable too
Just my little hypothesis :)
I wonder if that's what actually happened in most cases, though
A lot of countries known for being poor are *not* known for social mobility
> Danish TV-shows are usually short
That is the way to do it
I mean
when something goes on for 5000 episodes, it's not going to be very good is it
Don't forget "Heartbeat"
In Norway, because of all the fjords, mountains and valleys there are thousands of dialects, some only spoken by a few hundreds or thousands because geography separated them for thousands of years
So yes, there are many dialects I struggle with
It's been times I am not even sure they are speaking to me in Norwegian
There used to be a popular tv show in the 80ies where some local person from a village would say a few sentences and Norwegian dialects experts could guess what village they were from
And they could pin it down within a few kilometers if they were lucky
That is to say, there are so many dialects in Norway, many villages have their own version
People who move to bigger towns and cities usually make their dialects more understandable (I guess because they get tired of being asked "what
"), but many like to keep some of their dialects to signal pride in where they are from
...and when you hear them speak with somebody from home, they completely change their dialect back to the original dialect they grew up with :)
While dialects vary significantly from region to region
I understand pretty much all of them
Some old people with very thick accents might be harder to understand, but they will make themselves understandable
This is a good example of a difficult dialect, I think it is from Nordmøre
I am not really sure, but I think it might be "På dialekten" [
See, I didn't understand any of that
So apparently I find Italian dialects hard to understand too
Depends on where you are
The coast, especially in the south doesn't get as much snow as you'd probably think
Inland regions and up north gets a lot
Where I live, in Trondheim we got our first snow in late October/early November last year, although it didn't stay for very long
Then it came back and stayed on the ground in early December and more or less stayed continuesly until April I think, although a few days it got washed away by the rain
The north pretty much got more snow than ever last year, they had loads way out in May, and they even got snow in June some places
I live in the north and the mountains around are already white
Last year we got snow mid October which lasted until June
Normally it doesn't last that long but there's always snow in winter
Where I'm originally from, a suburb of Oslo, we would also always get snow but some winters, it would be very little
Here it snows from late october to early may
(In Northern-Norway)
Depends a lot on where you live
But where I’m from the first snowfall usually comes in October/November (this usually melts away in a day or two) then from mid/late to early December it stays on he ground until March/April
But as many others points out, there’s definitely less snow now than when I grew up, and the freezing cold ( -25 to -35 degrees) is rarer as well
Where I live it starts snowing around October-November and it usually stops in April but this year it snowed well into May
Here it’s snows from november sometimes late october and then until april, though it’s decreasing how much snow we get
we stilll get a lot of snow, although less than before
but last winter it snowed from November to May
It used to snow in December, but now it usually doesn't happen until mid January
There might be some days where there's a little bit, but it melts the day after or so
Edit: I live in the southeast
South in Norway, specifically Haugesund, it mostly rains  over the winter, but snow isn't "rare". We usally get like 5-10cm, sometimes more, but not every year
It has even happend that there's no snow almost the whole winter but lots in like mach and april
Yeah, we get little snow in general (Bodø) but last year it snowed in May, a lot
I would say though, we get less snow now than before, but with global warming going on, the gulf stream might shut doen so some day er might be like Antarctica
1000000,65 isn't better honestly
Now you have to count the damn zeros
With bigger numbers it gets worse but then again, most of those are written 4
65\*10\^28
Being an atheist is like preferring Coca Cola over Pepsi, it's very common and extremely unlikely that other people would care about it
I'm a atheist and I have never met anyone outside of internet that have cared what my religious views are
Normal
I think there are more atheists than religious people here
That might not be shown in statistics as many are still member of the church even though they're atheists
Which reminds me, I should probably remove myself as a member of the church
No one cares what you believe
The only religious people i know are my grandparents
They’re more common than theists from my experience, but people are respectful for the most part
As the norm
the imortal rulers of the galaxy
They are viewed as both normal and common
Although I tend to meet more agnostic people than atheists
I live on the south coast, so religious people are very common as well
That's an amazing analogy
Not so sure, most people I know discriminate against Coca Cola drinkers
Edit: also i read somewhere that less than 20% of our population is religions but I can't confirm that
That's sad
Non-judgemental Norwegians are ;)
Pretty sure the most popular drink here is Pepsi Max but I don't actual numbers on it
I wouldn't say they're very prevalent, no
They're mostly known for knocking on doors and handing out their magasine
Interesting that you've heard horror stories about them
I wouldn't call myself young anymore given that I am approaching thirty, but I am certainly young enough to have not experienced how it was like thirty years ago, so you are probably right
She really likes cake
That she's fat and likes cake
Nei, vil ikke
> He refuses to say how many children he has
Very bizarre indeed
There's a twitter account that pretends to be him
Pretty wholesome [jokes]
>A bit annoying that the shaman can switch the TV channel without the remote control
> A lot of people thinks that it’s funny and call him “knugen” instead of “kungen”.
That is a bit funny actually
(Unless he has dyslexia of course)
In norwegian you only get the sh sound from sk, sj, skj, sl
Does it help that there's absolutely nothing else around
I imagine there's a difference between that and living on a French island in the Caribbean where you're more likely to interact with other countries in the region
That’s super cool
How are people from Curaçao treated
Are they viewed as similar as Dutch people or even those from Aruba
They also did a podcast about "why and how people live in earth's most isolated and extreme settlements" which include St
helena, Svalbard and Pitcairn:
That's very interesting
I didn't know
Spanish and Russian for the usefulness in travel
Would open up so many new countries and areas I could visit
Finally I would say either Mandarin, Japanese or Arabic
Although I guess Arabic might not be that useful due to all the different dialects and varities, some which are not intelligible from each other
Japan is just an interesting country and Mandarin could be cool just considering u can finally communicate with 1 billion new people
And it would be cool to actually get to understand and learn the culture there
I have no real idea what daily life is like in China
I already speak Norwegian, English, and Spanish
I’d learn French, German, and Mandarin because they are  so common
Spanish would be a logical choice, but I have a weakness for Portuguese
Mandarin would be a snart choice in this day and age, so that
The last one
hmm
Arabic
Oof, this is difficult
I'm a Norwegian translator and would base my choices on work opportunities
I already speak and write English well, but would like to be fluent, i.e. mother-tongue level
The two other ones would be Arabic and Mandarin, I think
Or Spanish
Or Russian
Or Korean
Or I might go for programming languages and make new career alltogether
Norway obviously wasn't a part of the USSR, but in Kirkenes there is a monument that honours the soldiers that fell when the Soviets drove the Nazis away from Finnmark
The statue itself is standard Soviet stuff, a soldier with a gun with a plaque that is in Russian and Norwegian
The monument itself is placed in a bit weird location, but I would oppose removing it, and I don't think anyones planning to do it soon either
The people from Finnmark are so much more pro-Russia/Soviet than the rest of the country, and everyone got pissed there when they weren't allowed to invite Russian delegation for victory day celebration
I don’t really think this counts, but in Svalbard (an archipelago in the North Pole that belongs to Norway) you can find the northernmost Lenin statue in the world
Most Norwegians don’t really care about it, mostly because only about 2,500 people live on Svalbard and about 20% of them are Russians or Ukrainians
The statue is situated in a ghost town and the only ones who lived there before it got abandoned were soviets
Today it’s mostly just a tourist attraction
Personally, I don’t really care either, I just think it’s a cool tourist attraction
[Soviet Liberation Monument in Kirkenes]
(I couldnt find an english version)
Norway hasnt been under any control by the Soviet Union, but it was built to celebrate the Soviet Union’s work in liberating Norway in WWII
I dont think there is any hate towards the statue, its just a Soviet soldier
That's pretty cool
(well, the story, not that he was a POW)
Historic fact
After the war ended German POW in Norway complained they were treated badly while Soviet POW's were ''treated with love and affection'', despite the Germans not giving the Soviets food and using them as slave labour leaving hundreds, if not thousands dead
Of course, Germans had to do pretty horrific stuff too, and several hundred died only due to them being forced to remove mines they had placed themselves a few years earlier by hand
> You should bring your glass back to the bar when you order another drink or when you leave
Fuck, last time in was in an English pub I totally forgot to do that, left our glasses on the table and bailed out of there
Here they usually come and get the glasses themselves
Now I feel guilty ://
I quite like the buying your round concept
Makes it so you all don't have to get up every 20-30 min and flock to the bar like a herd of sheep
Problem here is that people rarely buy more than 3-4 beers in the bar itself because of the prices, most of the drinking is done at home
Also if you're in your early 20's or whatever some places will get suspicious if you want to buy 5 beers at once because they're afraid one of you is underage or something
They're so bloody strict about it here
I wish buying your round was more common here though
Typically Norwegian police is unarmed, but we have had periods where they’ve been armed with hand guns
Usually their weapons are kept in a locker in their vehicles
Not common
I have personally never seen an armed police officer
I see it mentioned but wanted to clarify
In Norway, they keep light and sometimes heavier weapons locked in the car
If they get sent to something that may require weapons the command simply tells them to arm up
You only see armed patrolling police around airports and embassy buildings
Heavily armed isn’t seen that often, except during special occasions or at special places like embassies, but not regularly at airports and train stations etc
The Norwegian police shall as a general rule have their handguns and other firearms locked up in their car or at police stations and have to report in if they feel the need to arm themselves
Although the last years there’s been a temporary arming of the police due to increased threats of terrorism where police officers carry a handgun in their belt, this temporary arming has been continuously prolonged since by Stortinget (the Norwegian Parliament)
This makes the status quo and de facto general rule in Norway today that police officers carry handguns
Also, the officers have to actually call in to get a permit if they feel that they need to arm themselves
Their request might actually be denied if their boss doesn't feel that the mission is dangerous enough
Side note: I have a life long friend who's a police officer, the nicest guy imaginable
He had borrowed something from me, and texted me to see if he could drop by and deliver what he'd borrowed *if there's time during my duty* he added
A few hours later, my doorbell rang, and there stood a fully armed police officer
Even though I knew it was my friend, a jumped for a second when I saw the gun at his hip
It has practically become the new normal that police officers carry handguns to all times, since the period of arming is continually prolonged
I had the same experience, though not Spain
I was like "Why would a normal police officer walk around with a gun on them at all times
That shouldn't be necessary
Unless it's a high risk country like somewhere in the middle east or the US
They send you in
Wow, exciting
What's the worst situation you've had to deal with
I was taught to separate north and south America, and that Australia is a country while Oceania is a continent
A little unrelated question
Where does the devide between north and south america go
For me, the most sensible would be that everything north of the Panama Canal would be North America, but based on what I’ve read it seems like only Mexico, USA and Canada is North America, how does that devide makes sense
Same in Norway
My class were thought 7 “world parts”(verdensdeler): north-America, south-America, Europe, Africa, Antarctica, Asia and Oceania
and 5 continents: America, Africa, Eurasia, Antarctica and Oceania/Australia(a bit of a debate here)
Yeah
Many confuse World Parts with continents, but this is the way it is taught
So if there are two continents, North and South America
Would everything north of the Panama Canal, including the caribbian, be North America
Yes i did Sorry
In more populated areas there are often a combined path for walking and cycling asides more trafficked roads
Cycling on roads with some traffic can be a bit scary, especially if it’s an older and curvy countryside road and you can’t quite know what’s behind next turn or hilltop
Car drivers are notorious for being generally against cyclists here and will often not take any considerations towards you
In the “cities” cycle lanes might exist, but it’s often a bit patchy
The cycling infrastructure in Oslo is improving, but still a joke at large
It used to be quite bad in Oslo, but in 2015 the Green party won the election
I am not a fan of the party, but one job they have been amazing at for the past 5 years is building bike lanes
My family have gatherings during birthdays, christmas and New years eve
We have dinner, desserts and liqour later in the evening
Well, we are a very musical bunch
My uncle (4) is a jazz pianist in Spain and has written an opera that was showed in Madrid (met his wife there, they moved here, but then they moved to Spain) , uncle (3) plays clarinet, piano and guitar, uncle (2) plays guitar, mom is a trained opera singer, but never got to perform as a headliner because my older brother was born with disabilities so she stopped to take care of him
She later on used her musical education as therapy for him and my twin who's also born with disabilities
My dad met my mom in a youth choir that used to tour the whole country
He later quit singing tho, but his brother uncle (1) still sings and used to be an actor in local plays
So yeah, when we all gather, there's bound to be music
A lot of it too
I used to be an actress too, here in my city, until some medical mistakes took that away from me
Anyway, we tend to go all "house band" with music from all genres
My dad btw, I call him a lost hippie, cause he's all about ELP, Asia, Marillion, Focus, Jethro Tull, that type of music
Mom and I share more of Beatles, operas and musicals
So yeah
Full on house band, all genres, mom and I sing while the uncles play, and it's great fun
We try to have reunion with all the extra cousins and outer family
We have relatives in several countries so we try to invite everyone, get a big locale with lots of space
Last time, we had cousins from the US coming, and my mom drew up a massive family tree and filled in how everyone else is related, and for any blank spots, others could fill in
We had games, music and a bunch of awesome

Its even weirder when you throw in our dialects, you can get stuff like:
"E d d d e?" - 'is it that [what] that is
in legitimate verbal conversations, and it would be a 100% allowed way to say it
Only twice

Olav Haraldsson
- Henrik Ibsen
- Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson
- Knut Hamsun
- Fridtjof Nansen
- Roald Amundsen
- Edvard Grieg
- Edvard Munch
I might add King Sverre I and Peter Tordenskjold as well, but I might be biased because I'm from Trondheim
Might I also add Snorri Sturluson and Leif Eriksson from our Icelandic friends
Vidkun Quisling, whose name became a synonym to traitor, and perhaps the most infamous man in Norwegian history, should be on this list
Maybe Max Manus, Gunnar Sønsteby and Quisling too
Or are they not historical/as known as i thought
I'd add Einar Gerhardsen
TIL the Danish polymath Piet Hein is descended from a Dutch Piet Hein
Was the first name to spring to my mind so I agree
I don't think most people remember him at all
I figured that the requirement that *everyone* should know about them is a really high bar to clear, even if not interpreted literally
Well, everyone have heard of Snorre, and his Heimskringla is very important to our understanding of early Norwegian history
Look at everyone claiming Charles the Great
No, it's a different person
True, or at least there's no real evidence for him being historical
Neither Snorre nor Leiv Eiriksson should be on this list
They might descend from Norwegians, but both lived in the Icelandic Commonwealth from birth till death (or Greenland in Leiv's case)
It's like if the British should go ahead and claim famous Americans for their list
No, but we had a [Spanish tourist that fell off a cliff] Does that count
That particular incident was actually the very first time anyone fell off that particular cliff
Which is quite extraordinary [when you look at it]
I'm so used to it that I don't think much about it
It's better for expressing complex thoughts and emotions than my native language, which I use more for the daily mundane stuff
yeah, i'd say so
It's a pretty freeform language with shorthand words for a lot of things
THIS
Pronounciation is the hardest word to get right the first try
The place where my school is I believe there's like 2-3 active cases of someone having the virus, so I think it's going to be fine
The stupid stuff is they don't mention what age that person is theyre like "Oh this person is between 18-65 years old". It's kinda infuriating and doesn't help at all
The kids are safe
I'm not worried for myself either, even though I'm a teacher
But I'm worried about my mother, who has a problem with her lungs
I haven't seen much of her since march, and I fear I won't be able to see her for maybe another 6 months because I may bring the virus to her
Yes, school reopened in May and that went well
My kids aren't in school yet, but they're both back in preschool/kindergarten and we feel safe
Cases seem to be rising slightly after people returned from summer vacation though, so we'll see
I feel very safe
I trust that the government will close all schools again if necessary
Our King, Harald V, has a great sense of humor
[One Example:]
him and the queen talking about some kind of station:
King: wasn’t the station named after you
Queen: No, it’s called Troll
King: Yes, exactly
"There was a moose in the engine"
-The *rally driver* ~~can't remember the name of~~ Petter Solberg, who's embarassingly bad at English
I’m guessing Petter Solberg
wait she actually did that
Even I didn’t know lol
That's the guy
She’s chill
I'd say there's a bit of prejudice
I'm not sure if it's the mixup with Romani or just prejudice based on a small amount of people from there - truck drivers from Romania or nearby countries that behave like idiots and endanger people by flouting safety laws, for example
Or if the more prejudiced people actually think Romanians steal or whatever
Then there's the corruption thing, but as far as I can tell, that one is actually bang on the money, unfortunately
Gypsies, corruption, poverty, thieving immigrants
I know some lovely Romanians (who married Norwegians, hence why I know them)
But Romania as a whole is probably by most seen as very poor, and the home of all the Gyspys coming here every summer
I remember it because I thought it was extremely funny back then
And it still is, so no shame in making the same joke again
Probably [Nidaros Cathedral] [.] the northernmost gothic cathedral in the world
Other than that we have the [Old Town Bridge] Fortress] and [the Monk's Islet]
Trondheim has the worlds northernmost proper medieval cathedral
It’s also the largest in scandinavia
We have a few buildings from before World War 2 and like a very tall plastic Santa overlooking the fjord
Idk if we'd really call those landmarks though
Well, rather disappointingly, our word for hammer is hammer
The pronunciation is not that different either from English
Kind of makes sense as the word is Germanic/Old norse
It's hammer in Norwegian too
Main difference in pronounciation is the 'a' is pornounced like it is car
I think we have a winner
In the west we have the sharpest of Rs, so I'd argue that a western Norwegian saying "hammar" is at least as badass
I live paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford to save anything
Currently a student though, with very limited income
Some save to buy a future home
No one saves for a rainy day
> Some could save a lot, but they spend everything
That is 80% of the Norwegian population right there
As a student, 40h a week is spent studying
I also work 40%.
with the monthly student loan payment of €850, about €20 an hour at work
after paying rent, Internet, cellphone, insurances, gas
yeah there’s barely any left
If you work full-time in a proper job, however, you should of course be able to save up too
It's our time to use the term *those southerners* for everyone, even those not in the South
Seeing as we are perhaps the country in europe with the largest gap between climate extremes from north to south (polar bears and arctic ice sheet vs temperate beaches) i’d say we gucci
The northerners will see big culture changes
No more emptyness, nature, cold weather
Some will like it, some won't.
The southerners will start to feel isolated, become bored more easily and starve more, since there's less options in terms of food in the north
They'll also wear more clothes than what they're used to
Housing in Oslo would become very cheap, as there would be thousands empty
SØRINGA
Also we would have the majority of Saami people living up north and not around Oslo
lingustic-layered cake : )
If we flip the country's population upside-down
The islanders would be thrown in the ocean
Oh wow, I didn't even think about that
My professor was insulted when I called him nordlending
He's from Finnmark
So I just told him not to call me søring
Worked like a charm
Where are we splitting
Right above Trondheim
No, just ocean
Yep
I think that's the place
yeah, holy shit
there would be an immense housing crisis as there’s not even close to enough houses up north nor enough people in the south
We’d all freeze to death long before that’s an issue
Or be eaten alive by mosquitoes, depending on the season
Meanwhile, the former northerners who have been relocated to Oslo all get hit by streetcars in the first week or two
They'd prolly knit sweaters for them and carry them around in handbags
Probably cause nobody north of Trondheim knows how to drive one
Norway is a very nature filled area (people hike a lot and stuff) so people are like reasonably ok with it in general
It's only when people are drunk that I really see them peeing on the city
On the other hand, in my city Bergen, there are so few public toilets (most of them are in malls/businesses and you have to pay for the private mall ones unless they are further out of the city)
So on days when the malls etc are closed and/or people are at locations too far to walk just to piss (like a park), then they try to piss discretely where they can (like bushes)
This applies for women too
Most people here also fully understand due to how shitty our city is with public toilets
Can't really complain about something with such a bad solution
Don't know that much for other cities though
I think they have more public toilets
Norway - Arrestable offence, but police generally don't patrol looking for public pissers
It isn't a large problem, as people are usually bright enough to not be overt about it
I know in USA you can become a sex offender (pedophile) charges and get screwed for life
When studying in USA many international students were warned of this
Then I learned it’s actually quite common
Can’t say much for Norway/Denmark
Honk honk honk
No, I prefer them soft
I always cook pasta longer than it says on the package
*reading though all the comments from the Italians
A coworker brought some delicious looking pasta leftovers for her lunch the other day
She heated it in the microwave, then
cut it into small pices
I damn near told her off
I'm curious, how is firm pasta healthier than soft pasta
I know, right
Cutting (or breaking) spaghetti is not acceptable
When I eat my home cooked pasta, I over eat everytime regardless of how well it's cooked
Yeah, it's kinda acceptable for kids
But not for 50 year old grown women
Beer prices
If I tell you to expect $14 USD for a single beer (*at bars, in stores you can get it conciderably cheaper*), I am not exaggerating
Is this because of old plumbing
I hope this isn't true in all of Greece, or I may have messed up a hotel on Korfu/Kerkyra
Funny guy
Cheapest is €2
6 or so, and the fancy stuff is higher (twice or more)
For 0
3liters
For instance, 0
33l Duvel is €5
Haha, yeah
I suppose you guys have a wider range of prices than we do
I've heard horror stories about some of your largest cities that makes it seem expensive from even our point of view
Relative to what
Our income
But probably to that of a few countries income
Imagine the nut shots back in the day
I’d have to wear a cup (athletic support) just to protect my baby makers
They largely only have pilsners though, so I can understand why
If it was a dutch guy on the other hand
By making sure everyone can afford it
Historically we have a pretty strong brewing tradition
In fact, 1000 years ago every farm was required by law to brew their own
A farm that abstained 3 years in a row would get fined (no idea how strongly or fairly this law was practiced though)
Moonshine also has a solid place in our culture although it's died off quickly over the past few decades
In modern times, we mostly shrug it off because we can afford it
A bottle of wine can quickly be priced at €85-350 at a restaurant
A glass is typically €8
5 to €13
So it's all similar
In stores you will get 1
5L coke for 2-3€, at restaurants it's 3-6€ for 0
3-0
5L (with a bit larger variance depending on quality restaurant)
You know, I've thought about that a few times
restaurants seem to have extremely high wine prices, whereas wine bought at the liquor store is pretty cheap with $9 for the cheapest
I've heard of spelling bees in the US, but I don't think we've got them in Norway/Norwegian
I know of the concept, cause it seems so often portrayed in american movies/tv-shows
I've never heard of a similar concept here, even though we also don't spell words the way we say them
Maybe not on the same level as English, but we have quite a few loan words that are spelled completely different than what we would say
Restaurant for instance, if spelled in Norwegian, we would probably write "resturang". Many Norwegian words are also said in a various different ways, and we have often more than one correct way to spell something due to our two written languages
I have only seen spelling bees in American movies
Never heard of one in Norway
Nope
Spelling Norwegian words is ridiculously easy
The younger the language, the easier it is to spell
Estonian for instance is younger than Norwegian, and even more easy to spell
English is a old language, so spelling is not always intuitive
We also have a very not-kingly king
He’s pretty cool
Norway: In their 20, no
In the 30's people start hinting
But being 35 and single is perfectly accepted in our society
Oslo: Every generic capital city stereotype
Bærum (Area outside of Oslo): Rich spolied kids
Daddy pays for everything
Agder (South of Norway): Relaxed, most likely Christians
Bergen: They only care about Bergen and not the rest of Norway
Obnoxiois and speaks too much
Møre (North-west): Greedy and harsh with spending
Inland regions: All farmers
Hates wolves and votes for Senterpartiet (one of several political parties in Norway)
Trønderlag (middle of the country): If from outside of Trondhein they love karsk (alcohol+coffee)
If from Trondheim the love karsk and Rosenborg (football team)
Also they all have mustaches
The north: Loves fish, swears constantly
Can be a bit blunt
All the way north (Finmark): Either reindeer herders or fishermen
Alcohol and swearwords
Svalbard: No people, only polar bears
From a central Norwegian perspective based on what I've heard expressed:
* **Far North:** - Depressing but beautiful area with Norwegians clinging to life in dying fishing villages and sami people herding reindeer
Death by mosquitoes in summer
* **Nordland:** - Often stubborn people who think they are special for living on the Arctic Circle
* **Trøndelag:** - The Holy land, objectively the best place to live according to locals
* **Namdalen:** - The easily forgettable part
* **Namsos:** - Wants to be Nashville after creating a couple musicians
* **Steinkjer:** - Calls themselves "the IT-city". Can only assume it's a joke
* **Innhered:** - Biggest collection of farmers north of Dovre
Loves moonshine and far left radical music
* **Stjørdal:** - Suburb of Trondheim, known for having Tronheim's airport
* **South:** - *"The crow flies upside down here so she doesn't have to look at it"* - Grandfather
* **Røros:** - Hasn't modernised their architecture since the mines ran dry
* **Trondheim:** - Ruins the rest of the country's perception of Trønders
Loves their leather vests and moustaches
* **Fosen:** - Where people get cabins to go fishing
Rumours of a local population
Also the air force
* **Jamtland:** - Swedish-occupied forests and summer homes
* **Inland east:** - Nice lads
Makes some country music, otherwise not much
* **Coastal/urban east:** - Right-Wing rich spoiled EU-supporters who don't know about real life
* **The south:** - Can't pronounce their P, T, R and Ks
Enthusiastic Christians
* **South-West:** - Stavanger and Bergen, only relevant if you work with oil or like football rivalries
* **North-West:** - Called Møre (even Fjordane)
Christians, might be greedy
Trøndelag: Alcoholics and pedophiles*
Western Oslo: Rich, arrogant fucks
Eastern Oslo: Immigrants and crime
Østfold: Cars, smoking, funny accent
Hedmark: Inbred farmers
Oppland: Farmers
no you're thinking about the thing with the straight bananas
In Norway is not necessarily easy, depending on where you live
I grew up close to Sweden though and we went there once or twice a month I'd say for shopping
Mostly food and drinks but also other stuff
It's hard to explain the "feeling", it's just very natural
Scandinavia especially is just very socially and politically connected
Going over there is kinda just like driving a couple hours to see your uncle or something
Pretty chill, cheap alcohol and sugar is just an hour away
Its nice
We only drive for 30 min, then sit on a ferry for a couple of hours, and in Denmark we are
Since most of the time is spent sitting drinking coffee on a ferry it doesn't really feel like travelling at all
A great way to start your summer holiday
Grew up near the finnish and russian borders, it became very routine
It is really great for road trips
As a vacation you can just get in your car and drive and visit one or more countries every day
Different cultures, food and languages
And especially good nowadays when there are no border crossings, euro is a common currency and you can use your mobile phone everywhere at no extra cost
...God I miss travelling :)
Before covid, it was very common for us to go to sweden to buy alcohol and groceries because it's much cheaper
200km really isn’t that far though
My wool boots
I have a pair of traditional wool boots (Nesnalobben) that I use nearly every day during winter
They’re made of felted wool, and aren’t waterproof at all, but who needs waterproof boots when it’s -20°C outside
You don’t take them indoor, because the snow on them would melt and the shoes get wet
You take them off outside and leave them there until next time you step out
They might not be common for the everyday Norwegian, as most modern people don’t use hardcore traditional stuff, but they’re very common to me
Warm as fuck
Some days I can’t even wear wool socks in them, as it simply gets too hot
ETA [Here’s what the shoe look like] Thought I could provide a link in the original comment so y’all don’t have to read through every single comment
Putting [woollen underwear] on the younger children starting in October at the latest, and not stop doing so until March, at the earliest
Cotton is only used when they get older, plus in the warmer part of the year
I love those
I actually got mine from my aunt a couple of years ago and couldn't understand how I hadn't worn them before that
Those types of boots is one of the few reasons I wish I lived in a colder part of Norway
Thank you for posting
I know exactly what to get for my birthday money
It's actually warm here today, only - 14c!
Thanks for making Norwegians happy by mentioning our only invention, the cheese slicer ;) Just want to point out that on softer cheeses, you use the [Norwegian type cheese slicer without the flat part] The flat "tongue" part is what messes up the softer cheeses
And to be honest, the slicer type without the flat part works perfect on all cheeses and is a better cheese slicer IMO
The only difference is the cheese slice after cutting is left on the cheese, not on the cheese slicer
You can get the Norwegian type with the flat part cut short though
It works better with the softer cheeses
Similar thing here, you get to keep the AG after service
Spanish people, you are just spoiled with sun and warmth :) In Norway we want every bit of light and warmth into our houses
But to be honest, I have rented apartments in Spain with these shutters and I have thought this must be kinda a bad neighbourhood and that those things were for home safety
They aren't uncommon north of the arctic circle since the sun is up all summer
I remember being a kid, the kicksled was fine for crossing lakes but also on paved city roads before they started to use salt
My first taste of freedom
Also, my neighbor had one with a engine, [very similar to this]
In Norway, we call them «spark», meaning kick
When I was a kid, we used to put a lot of them together, and make a train of them
We went pretty fast, and had no control over the stearing
It is a miracle that we survived the 70s. :)
In Tromsø, in the north, people in the same neighbourhoods sometimes have what they call «Sparkiade», where they all meet with their kicksleds, and «travel» from house to house
In one house, they are served an appetizer, in another house they are served drinks, in another they are served dinner, etc
I have been to Sweden and Finland a lot, yet I have almost never seen one there, in Norway these seem to be much more common, though I might have not visited the right cities
Grew up using that, it is called a spark (kick) in Norwegian
But that was before they started salting roads
They only used gravel and sand on slippery roads and pavements back then, so we could just kick through those parts of the roads with sparks flying :) If it was late winter and snow had melted before freezing again, it was allmost impossible to walk because of the ice, but perfect to use the spark
I still remember the feeling of steering it by bending the handles hard to one side and standing on one skid in sharp turns <3
We had separate hot and cold taps - until the war ended and the mixer tap was invented
Visiting the UK, I have never understood how you deal with separate taps
When you wash your hands, do you first scold your hands in the hot water killing all bacteria, then ease the swelling with the cold water
tf is a sink scraper
Here in Norway, we just drink
Aromat is great for everything, although it is mostly salt and MSG
Not quite, [they look like this] I have the tall black model, but the low gray one is the original traditional one
Oooh
That webshop has lots of nice things
Google translator translates "boots" into "blankets", and "slippers" into "drawers". Which is kind of funny
But since there are photos it just adds charm to the shopping experience
(Although I didn't check if they ship to Norway)
Haha, no worries
Most of traditional Norwegian clothing has never been mass produced
Most sweaters and such have been made by your average grandma (well, yes and no, but you might get what I mean haha)
Dale of Norway is probably the “only” brand that has taken traditional knitwear into the bigger scale, as far as I know
I’ll happily stand corrected if anyone else knows
On the top of my head, Amundsen makes some vintage looking outerwear, and brands such as Kari Traa makes wool baselayers with Norwegian inspired patterns on it
>  I don't think I'd need boots like yours, but are there other brands or types of Norwegian clothing and outerwear which you'd recommend, which are also that type of traditional thing
Another Norwegian here
For specific garments, there's something called selbuvotter (Selbu mittens), which are really traditonal
They look like this: [
Wool doesn’t really get *cold*, so no, not really
By the time your sock stops being warm, your shoe is heated back up
Cool
Get two sizes bigger than your normal size, they don’t have a left/right so you need some extra room (most websites who sell them state this I believe, just to make sure)
Dry them up and store them
You don’t wear them when the snow melts because it’s far too warm by then anyways haha
The boot itself isn’t cold, just the air inside it
Your wool sock is a nice and toasty foot temperature, so when you put your warm foot in, most of the cold air is pushed out :)
I usually just put my buns on top of the toaster without that fancy grid
But just for a short time
Depends on the house though
My parents house don't need anything like it, it is incredible insulating
Hot in the winter and cold in the summer
But my house now definitely needs some outside sun shading
Thin walls and big windows kinda sucks
Is it the same as an air fryer
Sorry to rain on your parade here incredibleflipflop, but keeping your shoes outside so the snow on them never melt, seems to me something you like to do
It is not something you have to do
Unless you live your life stomping through fresh snow every day, it seems easier to brush off the snow before going indoors
And if not, the shoes will dry like any other shoes without being ruined
I grew up using the Nesnalobben, but the [traditional short one] (non-Norweigans, don't click the link, it is not the stylish modern one, but the ugly original one)
That wool is tough and can stand rough use, we didn't even bother to brush off snow and those shoes were good for several winters
If any problem it is these are too warm winter shoes
I live in Norway and I can't even wear them
Now it's been cold enough for two weeks, but the next time its cold enough might be 5 years from now
So I am resisting the urge to buy boots like this, as they are rather pricy for so little use
I'm struggling to imagine how you fuck up with a cheese slicer
Looks very similar indeed
Yeah of course
:) Snow is only wet when it melts
The snow might stick to the wool, but since all the warmth is inside the shoe and not on the outside, the snow that sticks to the shoe stay perfectly frozen
I know plenty of people who leave them outdoor, so it’s not just my parade you’re raining on, haha
We often go outside every 3-4h throughout the day, and do indeed have quite a lot of snow
I brush off the worst snow before I leave them be, but taking them indoor still makes them moist and moisture = cold
Nothing that is considered traditional - you have the Bunad but that’s our national costume, crazy expensive and made of wool haha
Summer outfit is more of a modern thing
It's called Selburose (Selbu rose), based on where it comes from
Coffee enema
I would argue otherwise
The metal ones are the best
The plastic slicers get blunt fast and you will have a hard time cutting anything but a big hard cheese, even then they will create thick slices
I do too, but let's be honest
We don't have a Finnish sink scraper
(Being totally honest, I still don't understand the sink scraper
Do they leave the sink scraper at the bottom of the sink collecting the peeled bits or do they actually scrape the sink with that plastic thing
Yes, that’s it
So when it’s around 5°C to -5°C I don’t wear them
The snow tends to be not as dry when it’s warm, but then again it’s simply too warm outside for those shoes anyways
Why am I not surprised fish-socks are a thing in Iceland
no, thanks
Hivemc
eu i think the ip is, its a minigames server
Sad how all good servers are ruined by US ping
You should check out the server the spiffing brit made
He makes on it
It depends, it is probably unplayable for people using wifi in countries with bad internet
In which case you have to play eu servers
I used to have shitty wifi internet and playing on hypixel was shit, but when i got fiber it was good to play on
High speed rail
I live in Trondheim which is almost 8 hours away by train to Oslo
With high speed rail that time could be more than halved
When taking into consideration the trip to the airport and back + checking in and waiting + 1 hour flight, it would make the two alternatives close in total travel time, with the added benefit of trains just being more comfortable and you didn't have to stress about switching modes of travel for the entire trip
The nature is a bit more
challenging than other places, but if we can build a highway under and over fjords in the west, we should be able to construct high speed rail between the largest cities
Raise taxes, I don't care as long as I get my high speed rail
Fresh locally produced vegetables all year around
(Current season is May - September)
I agree with you
This is where northern Europe is behind
My neighbour has one
He grew up in Iran
I agree
It should be a no-brainer but for some reason we just goootta build those highways in the middle of nowhere that much fewer people will use instead
From Oslo I’d love high speed to Bergen, Trondheim, Stockholm (there is a private initiative to get this going) and Gøteborg
This
I would also love cheaper train tickets
A seven hour train ride from Oslo to Bergen costs almost the same as travelling by plane (45 mins)
> Prison for tax evasion
What happens now
Are they given a fine
> My mum is British and dad is Italian and there is a stark difference in the knowledge of cooking between both countries
Very interesting combination
One question; are wealthy Brits more likely to make food from scratch
It’s also way too easy to fire people in the US
Tourists have no reason to visit Estonian residential areas though
And who cares anyways when you have the prettiest capital in Europe
I am really curious about how the topic of bidet came up in a conversation with a neighbor
Are you guys friends or something
Not really a no-brainer because of the huge costs and questionable profitability
I do think it's a good idea though
If you're building high speed rail from Oslo to Bergen I think Haukelibanen is the best alternative
It is even more expensive, but it also connects to Haugesund and Stavanger
You cannot really compare high speed rail and regular roads
For high speed rails to work, you need a flat landscape
Well, unfortunately for us, our topography is terrible for high speed rail way
It becomes seriously expensive
That is the one thing that surprised me about Berlin when visiting last time
I haven't had cash in years, I only use my phone or card to pay touchless everywhere in Norway, but Berlin was surprisingly still very much a cash based society
I don't know why, but I thought Germany would have been quick to implement technology that is not really even new anymore
> *stares in free public bathroom* man this is something about europe I just dont understand
*stares at my mail box which has never seen a hospital bill (in spite of my son having been in hospital about 10 times the last couple of years, including 9 ambulances and 1 ambulance helicopter)
[Bergen] and [Trondheim] are nice
Which Finnish cities are most pleasing to the eye, in your opinion
Friends with my husband, so he has used his bathroom
Is there any traction to get high speed from Gøteborg to København
I know it is fairly quick already, but a proper high speed rail down there would be incredible even if Oslo-Gøteborg never happens
It’s not a huge cost compared to other ludicrous highways and roads we are building
Roads are not exactly profitable either
It’s just a matter of priorities
It’s not like the highways that are under works can be built with too much variation in height either
I am fully aware the topography makes it expensive
But it’s almost the same thing with highways, they too need to be built fairly flat, and rail is actually cheaper to build than highways in built road/rail pr
kilometre
Besides, most of (if not all) the proposed high speed  routes would be profitable from a cost-benefit standpoint, which is is not something you can say about a lot of infrastructure projects in the country, since we seem to have a need for catering to areas with low populations instead of building infrastructure that will benefit the most people
That’s all I’m saying
Much of the area between Oslo and Trondheim is pretty flat if you go through Østerdalen
And Oslo to Stavanger can also be made relatively flat if you follow the coastline
Oslo to Bergen is a lost cause though, unless we tunnel through the entirety of Hardangervidda, but it could perhaps go Oslo - Stavanger - Bergen
Norway and Switzerland are quite similar when it comes to cost of healthcare per capita (combining taxes and private cost)
And we don't see it as expensive
So that is interesting
I think I saw a report that the most feasible route would be through Hallingdal through Hemsedal
That route doesn’t have any extreme steep parts, but still would need to be built up a lot along the valleys
Edit: Might not be Hemsedal, probably through Geilo and Finse I’d imagine
Wonderful response, kiitos
Isn't the problem on the western side though
Yeah probably
I’m more familiar with the route on the eastern side, I’d imagine finding a good route along the fjords is difficult
Whenever people try to build something in the city centre a dead horse or a mug from the viking era is dug up, and progress stops for 5 years
Archeologists have to dig the whole construction site up with a toothbrush before you can keep going
Old vitnes in Norway have basically all burned down and been re-built at least 10 times, so you cannot really notice that a city is really old
Also the infrastructure gets redone a lot
But I would say in general Bergen is probably the most noticeable old city maybe
It has a lot of narrow roads and instead of asfalt there are bricks
The thought of calling houses from 1900-1920 historic homes is incredible to me ;) In Europe, that would be considered a regular home
That said, living in a house built in early 1200s sound really old for me as a Norwegian
I can't think of much more than some stave churches being that old in Norway
Hehe, most of the *homes* in my area are from 1920 at the latest (and most are from the first half of the 1800s)
I live in a building from 1929 and it's very modern compared to most of the other ones here
But I'd also be blown away on a daily basis if I lived in a house from the 1200s. There's a church nearby from around then though
100 years is the same in Norway and Netherlands
I am not saying a 100 year old  house would be considered a new house
I am saying it would not be historic
There are 100 year old buildings everywhere
Not the other candidate as much as the other side of the political spectrum
For example, I won't vote for a party which will aid our right wing parties in forming a government
The Greens, which I would normally support, have been unclear on this point, so I won't vote for them until they guarantee they won't support the right
The reason for this is that I believe keeping unions and workers' rights strong (and companies under control) is another essential part of trying to keep the planet sustainable in the long run
The more power and freedom companies get, the more the planet will suffer for it
Yes
In Norway we don’t really vote for the person in the party as much as we do the party itself
Now this is not to say that the leader of the party doesn’t affect wether or not someone will vote for them, but that is usually not the main reason why they are voting for the party
If anything, it's the opposite
People don't vote for a party if they dislike the leader
Like what happened with Venstre
AP is also struggling partially because of a weak leader who doesn't connect with the party's traditional voter base
Luckily our political system means that we're not constantly dominated by only for instance two parties or leaders like the US and UK, so we have a lot more diversity when it comes to our political parties and candidates
Unfortunately, we do tend to have a few "career" politicians, but yeah, at least politics in itself is more accessible to the common people here in Norway
You are correct
Although I was more thinking of it as compared to the US system
Where if the president candidate isn’t this perfect family man with a wife who supports them, then they won’t win
But yeah Støre and Grande has lost a lot of support for their parties because of their own issues
Julebukk
("Christmas-goat") Similar to trick or treat but it's done between Chistmas Day and New Year, and no one threathens you with tricks
The Children dress up, ring the door bell, sing a Christmas song, and get some candy
Sadly trick or treat is taking over, and I find that rather sad
Did trick or treat on Halloween take over
Seems like much of northern Europe had a similar tradition
In Norway children dress up as barn gnomes, Santas, or whatever they like
They sing a Christmas carol and get candy
Sadly Halloween trick or treat is taking over
Don't know about sex but I feel it's the same in Norway when it comes to nudity
I'm convinced we had more nudity on TV in the 90s  children's show than now
Well
I watch TV with my kid every day, and I'm sure there is nothing now
But I also think the little nudity that I saw when I was a kid was swedish anyway
It was the kinda natural innocent skinny dipping or putting on clothes in the morning, not a point in the story, just normal life
I must say though, seeing a naked kid on TV now would disgust me
Here it's sadly growing
At the same time as the Julebukk tradition is dying (dressed up kids going door to door singing Christmas carols, getting candy as a reward)
> Maybe it's a fad
No, it's actually been a tradition for hundreds of years
Used to be a thing in all of Scandinavia and Estonia, but now I beleive the tradition is only alive in Norway
Julebukk has been around for so long
Halloween is a tradition imported by people with commerical interests
Yes
I do hope so
Ah ok, no problem
I just drive normally
If there comes a vehicle in the opposite direction and we can't both fit, then one of us will reverse to a wider part of the road
Same here
Especially at night when you can see the other cars headlights long before you see the car, it's easy
Just slow down before sharp turns and if you meet someone and everything is going to be OK
"One of you" being whoever isn't driving the Toyota Yaris
The biggest reason for narrow roads in Norway is because expanding into two lanes would require you to either carve into a mountain, or fill in a fjord
Usually roads like that have meeting areas spaced out every so often, so you usually don't have to back up very far
Like this would be an example of a road like that, but it's obviously not always this extreme:
Probably morning mood or hall of the Mountain king
"En skål for Norge, kjempers fødeland" ( cheers for Norway, birthplace of giants)
Came here to say Peer Gynt Suite by Grieg; this is good enough
Heh, and here I was thinking [Bønda ifra nord]
I'm such an uncultured swine
Personally, as I've grown up in the west, it's Nordmannen (the Norwegian) by Ivar Aasen that resonates the most with the "nationalist" in my soul
Especially the part about longing for a warmer place in the middle of winter
I didn't believe Morning mood was from a Norwegian composer either, I mean, the song was used in Warner Brothers cartoons
I think i was teenager when i found out about Edvard Grieg
What's referred to as eastern Norway (The part where Oslo is ) is much further west than the northern part towards Russia
Not too weird maybe but I couldn't of any more
Most of our place names have something to do with physical features in nature
I have one: Nesbyen, that translates to "the city on the headlands", is a village far from the ocean, in a narrow valley smack in the middle of the country
According to this, it can apparently also refer to inland features
Same
That's why we haven't even joined
We want autonomy, not to have the bigger European countries rule us like a satellite state
We're only five million people and would barely have a say in anything
The children go to bed early, and get enough sleep
(We never have a problem getting them up in the morning)
And we eat homemade dinner together every day
The traditional standard in Norway has been to work from 8 to 15-16, including your 30 minutes lunch break which normally is eating your damn sandwich by your desk
Then you go home and have dinner, watch tv or whatever and go to sleep
Rinse and repeat
Work times and life to work balance have shifted to something more variable and flexible with different branches, requirements and different ways of life
Personally I don’t get how many people get time to everything anymore, free time activities, gym, reading and watching Netflix, besides job and sleep
Smartphones and laptops have whisked away a lot of the lines between work and free time in many fields, when you’re already working long hours and might have to catch up and be connected all the time that can easily mean you’re basically working around the clock
Which means less free time and less time for sleep again
Executives and highly educated people are enjoying flexi time at work, with 20-30 weekly hours
Much time for high quality food, recreational activities and sleep
Middle class are often working at all hours of the day, shift
With kids, debt and recreational activities there really is limited time to sleep
Food is often selected based primarily on price
Lower class here is a social experiment at this time
If you dont want to/cannot work, no problem, Norwegian government gives everyone about the same as minimum wage simply for existing
Then you have ample time to sleep, eat right and enjoy life in general
> I work full-time,
In some countries that might mean working 70 hours a week
So I think one of the advantages we have in Europe is a good size working week, and strong worker's laws preventing a huge amount of over-time
> But we're the best at working part-time
I didn't know
That is interesting
Today basically every Norwegian family eats taco every Friday
10 years ago nobody had ever even heard about tacos
We have taco Friday (fredagstaco)
A huge amount of people eat tacos on Fridays here for some reason
This sound like a "light" version of the Norwegian [russ]
Yeah, last decade
More like taco bell/texmex style
Supposedly we eat more than you per capita
Not exactly a city but Barentsburg is definitely the most foreign town in Norway, since it's literally a Russian town in Norway
I was thinking about Barentsburg too, but very few Norwegians get to see it
Something on Greenland, like Nuuk, might seem quite foreign to the average Dane
As far as I know, there are two: there's another one in Pyramiden, another old Soviet mining town in Norway (also in Svalbard, a bit further north from Longyearbyen and Barentsburg) that has since been abandoned, except for a handful of people working with tourism there
The western part of Sweden and the eastern part of Norway are very similair
Berlin has got the football team at least
I demand everyone speak english but they have to do it with a scandinavian accent like they do in vikings, the last kingdom and all the best detective drama shows
Floki knows best
Klingon
Pro: seems welcoming to extraterrestrials
Cons: nerdy, difficult
Shouldn't.
Vocabulary is too limited in comparison to, say, English
Why it shouldn’t
We aren’t a part of the EU
Norway is the only country where it is spoken and teached, so it is a very small and unimportant language that only a few people speak
There are way better canditates like French or German but the best is probably to stay with English since it so universal
Because [we got ÆØÅ!]
Holy
Fuck
So many Umlauts
Yeah kind of, but the differences between our two written standards is larger
Even within one written standard, you will sometimes find that there are more than one accepted form of writing
For example boka/boken, bro/bru, frem/fram are all accepted *within the same written standard
* Same thing with the other written  standard, for example de/dokker (this is relatively new) and tenke/tenkje are allowed
So I actually think those word examples you gave fit better here
For the two different written standards, there is a lot more difference, both words and conjugation can differ
Of course there are also many similarities
I guess it can be compared to the British vs American differences like learnt/learned, lift/elevator, just that we have more of it
As soon as you look at the text you know which one it’s written in, unless you get “lucky” with the first sentence or two that you look at
For example
Jeg har vært der en gang
Eg har vore der ein gong (/gang
Øv cårs
I think most nouns are the same, except masculine/feminine is way stricter in nynorsk, whereas in bokmål you could write most as masculine without issue
Neuter nouns are mostly the same core, with different endings
The biggest difference in my opinion are the "structural" words, such as "not", "I", "to/from".. Words that are in every sentence, but where the difference is very clear between the standards
Not sure this is much of a mistake but we let the black death in
This weakened our country and we lost our independence shortly thereafter, which we wouldn't regain until 1905
Finding America, live there for a few years, and then just leave again
Some king in the 1300s went on a horse ride
He fell off, died, and so 600 years under foreign rule began
What about the oil/Volvo deal
Was there any way we could have avoided that though
Virtually the whole of Europe, bar some areas in Poland and some barricaded cities was affected
Seeing as the plague spread here due to a rat on a ship maybe we should have stopped all trade but then again that would probably fucked us over too, and wasn't seen as worth it at the time
I think the plague was inevitable either way
Was thinking the same
We also lost a bunch of land to the danes in the process, including Greenland
Which outta become quite valuable in the future
Well, the Bergensers did
I think we could have stood a chance or at least minimised the impact
We could have closed our borders and the cold climate could have helped us

It depends on what time of the year it is, in the summer 0-5 degrees is very cold but in the winter those same temperatures are called mild
I hate cold weather so im glad i live on the west coast in Norway
I love warm weather and that's why i travel to southern europe at least once a year
To cold - below 3c
To hot- 40c +
Nice - 20c to 28c
Comfortable- 15 to 18ish
Cold: -10 and down
Chilly : -10 up to about 5 C, depends on the season and what clothes you wear
Normal: 5-15 C

Hell: 30 and up
can’t speak for all norwegians but personally it’s
cold: -11 and below
chilly: -10 to -4
nice: -3 to 12
warm: 13 to 22
unbearable: 24 and up
edit: i should also point out that i come from an island by the sea, and such lower temperatures feel much colder than they really are, so i would probably only consider it chilly if it was -12 and i was inland
the humid air and winds make the cold feel alot colder
cold would probably be -15 and lower at that point

Too warm | 29+
So if it's 10 degrees you walk out your door, realize it's 10 degrees colder than inside, and think "wow, it's hot today"?
Yes, 8°C in January is mild, even warm
In July it's freezing
5° on a sunny day in Easter, means enjoying a beer, shirtless after skiing
In September 5° means it's time to break out the winter jacket
And you call yourself Norwegian
Same here
I was born in the wrong place
Oh you're one of *those*.
It sucks balls (63°N)
I just stay inside most of winter
I live at 60
It's boring more than anything else
I would love for the sun still to be up when going home from work
Lived at 69 degrees north my entire life, I'm used to it by now
The only real challenge with it for me is that navigating in the wilderness if you're heading to a cabin becomes more difficult, because you only have a very narrow timeframe to have any kind of daylight and it's much more difficult to tell your location if it's dark
It might be bad if you've never experienced it, but it's made up for by the midnight sun in the summer, at least for me
Also, the first time you see the sun again in january is magical
69° (nice) here
The sun doesn't rise above the horizon anymore, and won't until late January
It's just a fact of life
You just suck it up, really
I live at 60 degrees north, and I actually prefer it
Winter is my favourite time of the year
Especially when it's really cold and we have lots of snow
I take a spoon of cod liver oil every day which has lots of vitamin D, so that might help
My husband is from France and he uses an artificial light
He can get really grumpy without it
To be fair, it's not so bad really
Only issue is, snow is rarer now, or at least it seems to be the case
No snow means less light in general during winter
thats the hard part
I lived in Finnsnes (northern Norway) from birth to 6 years old
The winter was dark
It was almost completely dark 24/7 and it never got dark during the summer
My mom is from Ålesund (where we live now) And she got used to the dark winters while living in the north
It's really not bad at all
If you are happy, have a good family and great friends, that's all the light you need
Vitamin pills are needed though
Nightfall isn't as sudden up north, so it does take a good while after sunset for the sky to darken
It's 14:20 here, now
Sunset is in ten minutes, but the sky is gonna turn blue through black over the course of the next 2-3 hours
It's always been part of life to me, so I don't really "deal with it" as such, but a few methods to stave off depression and lethargy could be vitamin D supplements, either through multivitamins or fish oil, and a strong blue light to trick your brain into thinking you're seeing more daylight than you actually do
I live 71°N, and I rarely see the sun, but to be honest I don't really see the sun the rest of the year anways cause I'm inside most of the time
I'm too busy to notice it, to be honest
It sucks, but you get used to it
The most depressing period is really mid-late november, when it just gets dark earlier and earlier
December is better, even though its darker, simply because of all the christmas lights and decorations which gives everything a much more cozy vibe
Then in January it finally starts getting brighter again and in February we're pretty much back to being OK
i live at about 60
you just gotta deal with it, you get a short amount of sunlight each day, and that time is usually spent at work or in class
so we usually just stay inside most of the winter, eat alot of fish for that sweet vitamin D. when you grow up with it you don’t really think about it that much tbh
the winters become dreadful after awhile though and you can’t wait for spring and summer, but that just makes it alot sweeter when that time comes
My needs for socializing decrease in the winter while it increases in the summer
So much that its difficult to fulfill my needs during that time which leads to a sence of loneliness
In the winter the need is less, so its easier to fulfill
Hence I feel less lonely in the winter
Other people also feel like this
Same, I just have to remember to always bring my reflective band things so cars can see me in the dark
I don't know, it's more fun to get wasted under the midnight sun
It helps
My son and husband both use one, and itt does wonders for their mood
Yeah, i clearly notice that i have a lack of energy and motivation
Going to work when its dark, going home when its dark
Always cold and raining almost every day, as it has been this fall, its not that fun tbh
I just want snow now
I find that exercising outdoors helps more than exercising indoors
You should never move to the equator then
Every day of the year would be 6pm sunsets
Atleast here at 69°N we have lots of snow that brightens the day, and with the full moon lately it's been wonderful outside
Beside some polar vortexes that've hit the area it's been really nice outside
I molde snør det fleire centimeter i kanskje en uke, og så e d en uke med 5-8 grader varme og regn
"Hello, Darkness, my old friend - you *just* left, did you forget something or what
Probably not a plot hole but I still think it's weird
Our nation day is constitution day which was the 17th of may 1814
Independence day, somewhere in June probably 1905 isn't even a public holiday and it was a huge deal at the time
One more: Norway took Iceland, Greenland and the Faroes into a union with Denmark, then straight up didn´t take them along out of the union
Just left them there with Denmark
It´s like walking into a burning house with your kids, then exiting without them
>A common source of pride and ‘Englishness’ is 1066, the battle of Hastings
This is when a French dude came over and became king of England
The only reason that happened was because the English and Norse armies decimated each other at Stamford Bridge a month earlier
If Harold Godwinson had been a sensible man and yielded to Harald Hardrada you guys could've avoided all that silly frenchness that came with Willy the Conquerer
Independence from Denmark was more impactful than independence from Sweden, no
Having our own constitution meant we could govern ourselves, right
Norway governed itself way more during the union with Sweden than the union with Denmark
Don't make us raise up Tordenskjold from the grave
Sure, more impactful, but I still think it's weird why independence day isn't really celebrated
How did you find that logo
It belongs to a group far up north in Tromsø lol
Oh wow, TIL
Definetly some old folk music, with fiddles
Maybe Myllarguten

Well if you ever need someone to ski somewhere
I know a guy
Or two
Or 10
or 5 million
Love and respect for nature
The right to roam
Isn't "jaywalking" more of an American concept anyway
I guess we’re staying out, as always
Reminds me of that winter with a lot of snow, and people skiing passed the office window on their way to work
(Had to go by bus myself, too far to ski)

People on reddit always seem to both present and consider janteloven very negatively, so glad to see someone pointing out the positive sides
Unrelated question: how's living in china going

We use both Helicopter parents and Curling parents
They're not quite the same thing
I live less than half an hour away from Borgund stave church, which is pretty much THE stavechurch, as it's maybe the prettiest and best perserved of them all
Personally never been there for some reason, but I plan to this easter
I've never been to the fjords on the West coast or up in Lofoten
Granted, it's a day's travel, but still
Can confirm
I paid to go close(r)
Wasn't worth it
But we went to some ruins near by (can't remember how near by since this is years ago)
The ruins were free to see, and much more fun
The wait and admission price during the summer is not worth it if you're local
I came back, didn't plan to go in, but discovered that the first Sunday of each month is free
So, I went on the free Sunday in december some years ago
No lines
You might want to read the question again
I think most people count by thousands so «tusen og én, tusen og to, tusen og tre» but my mom taught me to count elephants
«En elefant, to elefanter, tre elefanter
» It’s more fun that way
(My mom is danish, so this might be something they do in Denmark)
1001, 1002, 1003
In other words; one-thousand-and-one, one-thousand-and-two
Where I grew up in Norway we were taught to calmly count in thousands;
En-tusen, to-tusen, tre-tusen, fire-tusen, fem-tusen
Norway uses the same system
Also Norwegian
This is because Danish and Norwegian is nearly the same language, with only certain grammatic rules and pronounciation being different
(Danish uses Ds where Norwegians use Ts, for example
Like Knudsen and Knutsen)
[Sigh
(I'm sure none of you have seen this before, and that Danes isn't sick and tired of it
I don’t think every student who studie history of art is relying solely on a bachelor or a master degree
Most of the students in Norway, as I know of, choose a topic on their master degree on something more likely to give them a job, or just jumps over to some different subject to give them more weight on the job market
Brunost aka browncheese
Only norway
And whole wheat bread
I have to look for a long time to find some bread that is not loaf
Having a parade on our Independence Day
Edit: [link]
Same here
We even decorate our [christmas trees] with them
You should come to Norway and try our "burned almonds", which are caramelized
Looks like [this] or [this]
How do you feel about truncating or modernising Old Norse/Swedish names
Leif*r* *Ei*ríksson > Leif Eriksson
Erik*er* Magnusson > Erik Magnusson
We do use the native spelling, ish, of countries and places
We say "Italia" and "Hellas" for Italy and Greece
Norway has those, too
In fact we pretty much stole your best one
I think the Norwegian bunad is pretty well known
[Pic 1] and [pic 2]
That's interesting
It's almost unheard of in my area of Norway besides a few who have stared doing it
And mushrooms don't really have a place in local cuisine
Could someone make a map to visualize the number of saunas per capita in each country
I had some in sweden and norway
Yeah spelling was kind of a mess back then, but certain things like Eriker/Eirikr vs Eirik'/Eric' would never change due to spelling
That's a grammatical change, just like Epíkouros/Alexandros>Epikur'/Aleksander'. A bit different imo
Indeed
Where in Norway are you
In Eastern Norway mushroom picking is very big
In any large forest there will be mushroom controls to help you safely pick mushrooms
It's as big as berry picking here
Trøndelag
Ofc some people are picking mushrooms today, but it seems no one used to before recently
I just like Finland, ok
Sweden, the dirty rotten bastards
I'm surprised nobody said Norway
The vikings did a lot of killing, raping and pillaging during the medieval times
Norway is the country that gives out the Nobel Peace Price and making it seem like that’s all we want to happen
Especially as we participate in a lot of peace talks as a neutral party
We don’t say out loud that we are a very large ammunition producer so those countries that we try to stop shooting at each other with very high probability are using our ammunition to do so
Sweden
nah, iceland hasn’t done a lot of bad stuff
Don't forget the treatment of Saami people, sterilization, replacement of children to condition them into "Norwegians" and trying to destroy their culture and language, and a lot of this happened well into the 1980s
Netherlands and Switzerland have been filthy rich since the 19th century
Foreign companies surely help, but it is not like they have only gotten rich as a result of that as said by you
Norway went there, found no one, stayed for a bit, then left, then had other business to attend to in the aftermath of the Black Death, then it was re-explored by Denmark-Norway in the 1700s, and the Norwegian claim was handed over to Denmark in 1814 when Norway was given to Sweden
We would like Jemtland and Herjedalen back
Yes, I thought about that one at first, but someone from Sweden already said that, so it would be a boring answer
I think that was Danish vikings if not mistaken
you give them a lot of money
we should just dissolve every nation into small states so that they can’t do anything, you guys can lead the way, you have a history that
Oh yes
They're the best
A group from my bicycle club were having a meeting at my house to prepare for arranging a bike race, and one of the guys were to cut up 300 pieces of race info sheets (2  parts per sheet of paper), and he found my Fiskars scissor in the kitchen
"Oh no you don't", I said
"Don't use my GOOD scissor for cutting paper, use the cheap ass scissor from our clubs box of miscellaneous stuff over there"
"It's a scissor, you just buy a new one if it becomes dull".
"It's my *fiskars*, I don't want it to become dull"
Edit: My pair of scissors aren't orange but matte black, and it's the large kind with room for 3 fingers in the handle
My parents swear by them, they’ve got them in every imaginable size, from the smallest to cut threads while sewing or knitting to the biggest ones which chops down trees
They seem to be pretty popular here in general
Not me personally no
But my mum has one, and SHE CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT
Exactly the same story in my childhood
My so now has dedicated fabric scissors in her sewing set
A older pair of orange fiskars scissors lies in the kitchen drawer
I always feel like I'm breaking some law when I cut paper, string, chives or whatever with them
What if Napoleon won this time
Maybe Sweden would’ve been a part of Norway
I teach high school
I'm not worried about how far behind *my* students are
They can always catch up
But I happen to teach at an academic high school in a well-to-do area
I wonder how vocational students, who need more hands-on classroom time, are doing
I wonder how students who don't have their own laptop or tablet are doing, students who don't have a quiet place to work
Emotionally they are feeling the stress
What they mostly complain about is how things change
We're at school every day one week, then things change and we're at school some days but not others, then we're all online again
Recently we changed from at school every day to full online schooling in a single week
Similar things are happening with their activities
They have also been worrying about their grandparents and other family members for a year now, and the variant that is dominant in our area now is suddenly hitting the students themselves
Vaccines are coming more slowly than we had hoped and they know very well they are way, way down on the list
It's hard to ask teenagers not to be teenagers
They want to be with their friends and start finding their own space away from their families
My first thought; what does something like this even look like
Second thought; are apricots grown in Austria
Edit: I'm slightly disappointing in what they look like, but I believe you that they taste delicious
Dumplings seems to have never managed to cross the sea
(Denmark, do you have dumplings of some kind
> kroppkaka
you call those dumplings
We have kumle/kompe/raspeball (essentially different names on the same thing, - depending on which part of the country)
It's meat in the middle and potato and flour on the outside
[Photo]
So if that is dumplings, then I guess we have dumplings too
McDonald's chicken nuggets
Maybe some fries as well - if so, also a milkshake
At 11
45 pm
Nothing
It's way too late to eat anything
I wake up the next morning and eat a solid breakfast
Anything I could get my hands on
Atleast when I lived back where I grew up
County forced the gas station to close early so people wouldn't gather there and cause fights when out drinking as it was the only place you could buy any food after the grocery stores closed at 20
So yeh, you tried to survive on beer and nuts from the bar, but beeing a poor student you really didn't want to spend 5€ for a handful of peanuts
I’m a tiny person with “meh” tolerance alcohol
Four beers, unless I’ve been drinking for a whole day, would floor me lol
I’m not eating anything after four beers
After three though, my cravings are oddly specific
A good pasta carbonara, or fried rice
If I had four bears I don't think I could fit a pizza
Just leave it, all in good fun
Hmm
Maybe [Nidarosdomen] or perhaps something more modern like [the Norwegian Opera]
I think the English one is the Big Ben tower, from a foreigner's perspective
For Norway, probably one of the stave churches
I don't think it's the opera, that's Sidney
Maybe [Stortinget]
Edit: Actually, come to think of it, it may be our [Stave churches]
It's hard to say
Our country is better defined by its nature than its buildings
I was thinking about the castle
If we have to pick one, I would go with [Borgund stave church] even if [Urnes stave church] is the only one of them that's a UNESCO world heritage site
Yeah I think the stave churches is the closest we got
TIL the Big Ben tower has a name
When I had to commute, I used a cheap (€150) hybrid bike (road/offroad mix)
The price was the only thing I cared about
I wanted a bike so cheap that it didn't matter if something happened to it, I could just buy a new one
As for riding in traffic
My commute was about 12 km, and I had other options than riding in traffic pretty much the entire way (bike paths/sidewalks)
I have a road bike though, and I often end up in traffic with that one, and I just act like I would if I was driving a car or motorcycle
If you're on a bike on the road, you're just like any other vehicle
I’m in the process of buying a bike
So far this year i have used the city bike system to and from work every day on my short commute
40€ for a season pass
The system is up and running from may until the end of november (because of snow)
I live in a hilly, rainy city with lots of varying weather to consider
I use a hybrid road/offroad bike  (a GT Transeo) for my 7km commute with 200m inclination
I bought it used, so it is not a big loss if it gets stolen
What I need from a bike is:
1) Lots of gears to be able to handle the steep climb
My current one has 24 gears, which is perfect
2) Disk brakes, which is far more effective than rim brakes, especially in rainy weather
Climbing uphill means racing downhill, so this is essential
3) Needs to handle different tyre sizes
In summer I use 700/28, while my studded winter tyres are 700/35
We're considering getting a Tern GSD 10 for shopping and transport, but I will most likely keep my current bike for the commute
I need the workout and have showers at my office
I ride my GT transeo sport to school when its not winter
Mountain bike with big wheels(29 inches I think)
It’s not the best for commuting but I mostly use it in the winter where I need something able to handle the hell of salt and snow
Last bike lasted two years(it still works but something in the back wheel is messed up, forks are so rusted they don’t work anymore, chain is suffering)
It’s important to have good lights and not those cheap ones
Have had multiple fail on me and the tail light is currently taped on the bike
Cars will be irritated by you
And will speed past you if they can, and even when they shouldn’t. Was a bus that had stopped going opposite of me
Few cars behind
One of the cars had the guts to go past the others in my lane(the sidewalks can be filled with snow so road is the norm for me)
I quickly drove in the middle of the lane and forced him to drive backwards back to his lane
Other cars just pass when there is another car coming and almost push me off the road because I get so little space(was even one of our 3 section busses that did this)
Norway is also pretty decent for biking and a lot of people do it
Don’t know about sweden though
Also don’t forget about the wagon you put behind the bike with the space for two kids
So a type of hybrid bike as they are called
May I ask
What do you need a 6k bike for
I can understand if you do professionally cycling
well thats why the definition is pescatarian and not vegetarian
Not me, but my (adult) son went on a tour of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone a couple of years ago
You can only legally enter with a licensed guide
If you do what the guides tell you, the radiation level is very much safe
although they will tell you to wear a long-sleeved shirt or jacket, long pants, and closed shoes just in case
Don't go off the paths, into buildings, etc
, as radioactive dust may have collected there
Also at this point most of the buildings are nearing collapse, so they'd be unsafe to enter in any circumstances
There is a restored hotel inside the exclusion zone, though
You can spend the night if you're so inclined
Trees and other plants are basically taking over Pripyat, which is part of why the buildings are unsafe to enter
Plants were killed and did not recover in a few hard-hit areas, like the famous red forest, but mostly they are thriving now
The same is true of wildlife, which is flourishing since there are so few humans around
My son said they were visited during the tour by very friendly feral dogs, which like the humans because they often get the leftovers from the humans' lunches
900 - 1400, and 1814 - present
Edit: We could include the albeit very loose union with Sweden (1814 - 1905), and the Nazi occupation (1940 - 1945)
Hehe, um, you see, heh, it’s kinda complicated
1066-1537 (Norway brought together and lived happily)
1537-1814 (Under occupation by Denmark)
1814-1814 (We made our own laws and rights)
1814-1905 (Under occupation by Sweden)
1905-1940 (sweet freedom)
1940-1945 (at war with the nazis)
1945-present (we are free)
In conclusion, we only had 3 free periods after Norway came together
1814-1905 we were occupied by brother Sweden, and 1940-45 *ze* Germans
So there's that
Good point, although the union with Sweden was very loose
You are probably right
It was a mild invasion, which ended in a truce a few days later
Then we lived more or less happy hand in hand ever after ️
Venice
(However I did love the monastery youth hostel we stayed at there (run by real nuns)
Head nun was super strict, but really lovely at the same time)
Right now for me it’s Oslo
I’m stranded here in the rain after missing a flight, crippled with food poisoning
Seriously, fuck you Oslo
Explain this scam, please
Googling is unhelpful
> Did it disappoint you because it is actually sinking under tourists
Well that
and all the garbage in the channels
I would say all the garbage in the channels
So not at all like all the photos I'd seen beforehand,
Ah, the bracelet pests
Saw some like that in Milano once, but they weren't very persistent
Didn't know they randomly tell people "you look like africa".
Genuine question: are you saying there are mountains in the Oslo area
And if you want mountains and fjords you still don't go to Oslo, but to the west or north
Don't go to Oslo
The beauty of Oslo isn’t in the city centre, but the boroughs around IMO
What are your recommendations
I'm into food, culture and history
Also beaches are a bonus, but not a must
Oslo got Frogner and Grünerløkka as Stockholm has Östermalm and Södermalm
Old parts are dotted somewhere, not in one place like Gamla Stan
Funny though, much what you and others write here about Oslo was exactly what I felt in Stockholm, bland, not that nice city center and the architecture in the neighbourhoods around was all over the place, no symmetry like many streets in Oslo have
In general I guess it’s much about what you want of a city, do you want it to be a living city with real people or an amusement park for tourists (which mass tourism has done to great cities like Venice, Rome, Paris, the list can go on into the eternity)
Kind of fair, but to me it’s a clear border between the city centre with more commercial buildings and the neighbourhoods around with old residential buildings, cosy cafés and leafy streets
I don't think anyone would care
But why not look at the menu to find out
Asking the bartender instead of checking the menu gives me a "my time is worth more than your time" feeling, which seems especially rude when what you're after is the cheapest drink
Seems like a perfectly normal request, especially if you look like a student
You'd probably get back the options for the cheapest shots
In Iceland we typically know what’s going to be cheapest and just order that
Often there will even be a special, a pint of the cheapest beer (usually Gull) and a shot of the cheapest booze (usually Opal or Tópas) for something like 1000kr
They woulden't really care except for mabey being slightly annoyed of you later when you were drunk I guess
All the cheap shots cost basically the same since it is the alcohol tax that makes everything expensive
So you could have a flaming Sambuco, a Jägermeister, a vodka shot or a low cost whisky and they would cost about the same
And unless it was a fancy bar, the bartender would be fine with you asking for the cheapest shot
The cheapest shot will be ridiculously expensive anyway
Lol, what's rude about that
The bartender knows which one is cheapest, so it saves time for everyone to just ask instead of standing there uhm-ing and ah-ing while scanning the menu
That's what the bartender is for
Well, sure
The bartender probably knows everything on the menu
Why have a menu at all
Just ask the bartender about everything
What beers are on tap
What do they cost
While you stand uhm-ing and ah-ing while scanning the menu, the bartender can serve people in line who have already read the menu
Yeah, there usually are
Aren't there in Swedish bars
Often it's up on the wall behind the bar
If there's no menu then obviously people would have to ask, but in that case I'd assume they didn't have a large enough selection of shots to warrant much of a price comparison anyway
Is 3cl really common
We do 4cl for everything
Haha, if only
4 cl is both the norm and the max for all liquors and cocktails
The only drink you're allowed to serve with more booze is the Long Island Ice Tea, which can have a total of 6cl
You literally can't get a double whisky here or they'll lose their alcohol licence
From what I can remember it was a lot of our Viking history
Otherwise it was the classics - Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Babylonians, and Macedonia
Unfortunately it was mainly focused on European and Middle Eastern cultures
Egyptians, Greeks and Romans as far as I remember
And vikings, if you can call that ancient
The letter (not the sound you make when the letter is inside a word) itself is pronounced Hå. I can’t find the proper phonetic version, sorry, but I were to explain it in English letters, Hoh would probably be closest
Like in "hope"
The closest to the hå-sound would be "**ho**ver" and "**ho**pe".
Yeah
When someone ask you to help them spell out a letter, there’s always confusion with K and H lol
“...K...” “H??” “No, K.” “K??” “K for Kåre
Same with N and M.
Yeah, it’s almost like «hoe»
Not at all
Would LOVE to visit the ones I haven't been to yet
Moldova is high on the list
And Lithuania (since I've been to Estonia and Latvia)
Island one day hopefully
Edit: Island = Iceland
I wouldn't like to go somewhere I wasn't safe
I don't know how to handle corruption or religious fanaticism, so I'm staying away from Russia and I would be a little wary of going to Turkey
If I were gay, there would be more countries
I have no real desire to visit the ex-Sovjet states
No real reason really
Moscow could be a cool thing to check off the bucket list, and I have a wish to drive through Russia to see into North Korea (there's only one country between Norway and Korea
> Island one day hopefully
Which one
Amen to that
As a Canadian friend succinctly described my climate preferences: „you hate nice weather".
I've been to London several times and I never saw much garbage
Saw a few tourists of course, but that was to be expected
Would go back any time
The country
I'm a sessional lecturer at a uni and I love it when I have foreign students in my class who address me as "Dr
" or "Professor" or even "Professor Doctor [my last name]".
I'm just some 30-something dude who hasn't even finished his Ph
D yet and who plans on leaving academia as soon as I'm done
I'm not a professor and I never will be
But I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me feel important
Have you never heard of [Island] ?
Island is Norwegian spelling
haha
My mistake
Yes yes I know
"Langt-vekk-istan", far away land is the general expression, and you can tell someone to go "dit pepperen gror", where the pepper grows, which is basically used as a milder version of "fuck off"
My grandmother would also say she was in Africa if she got annoyed at us kids
"Langt-vekk-i-stan". Far away land
Not exactly the same idea, but similar
In Icelandic if we’re referring to a time long ago, we say „sautján hundruð og súrkál”, literally ‘seventeen hundred and sauerkraut’.
So gamla stan in Stockholm is like an old folks home
Le roi, c'est moi
the real mvp
I usually have a hard time with that
Whenever tourists try to say short phrases like that in Norwegian, I usually don't understand them at all, and they'll repeat it a few more times until I understand what they're trying to say
But maybe I just have a bad ear for 'accents'.
Most of the USA school shootings don't reach the news in Europe either
I didnt see it here, but doing a Google search I can see it was covered
However to much less of an extent
I could have missed some of them of course
But if you for instance [scroll down to 2018] most school shootings only resulted in one injured person, and no deaths
Which then would make rather uninteresting news outside of the US
Yes
Most school shootings have only one dead, or many times no deaths at all, only one or two people who got injured
So then there are more important news that fill the front pages
But the larger ones still have news interest outside the USA
I have never heard of anyone having a break-in while the they were at home
Almost all break-ins happens when the inhabitants are away
(Which is why we ask the neighbour to fetch our mail or ask them to make foot prints in the snow up to our front door)
I have never heard of anyone bringing a gun when doing a break-in
In Norway break-ins are somewhat rare compared to many other countries
Oslo and Seattle for instance have the same size population, but there are 15 times (!) more break-ins in Seattle
(And no, it is not because Seattle has a much larger black population, in fact it's about the same in both cities - around 7%)
A former boss did fetch his hunting gun once to scare off someone he thought was breaking into his garage
Turned out to be the mail man delivering a package earlier than normal, so he put it inside the garage to not wake anyone up
(Edit: he saw it through the window, so the mail man never saw neither him nor the gun)
I am not a lawyer, so there might be things that I've missed
The general principle is that the use of force to protect yourself has to be proportionate and appropriate in relation to the threat
That means that you cannot just go ahead and shoot a burglar, you need to have a legitimate fear that your life is in danger in order to go free
If you cannot prove that you're likely to face charges for manslaughter or second-degree murder
There are a lot of gun owners in Norway, but very few own handguns
Long guns are required to be stored safely
That means that either the weapon, or the bolt/firing pin and ammunition must be kept in a gun safe
Using a gun to kill someone in a potential life-threatenging situation where you had no other options or time to flee, call the police or resort to other means will seem suspiciuos
A home owner shooting an intruder will face questions on how come he had time to assemble the gun, but not time to flee or call the police
There was a case 25 years ago or so that illustrates the line between murder and self-defence
A home owner woke from noises downstairs and investigated
This home owner was a gun collector and had a collector's license for hand guns that he kept at home (this is legal, but quite rare)
He picked up a M1873 Colt Army Single Action revolver and confronted the burglar
He claimed that the burglar came at him with a steel pipe and shot him, killing the burglar at the spot
The court dismissed the self-defence claim and convicted the home owner of second-degree murder, even though there was substantial evidence indicating that the burglar indeed had held a steel pipe
If I remember the case correctly the court considered two vital things when they dismissed the self-defence claim:
1) The revolver used was a antique single action revolver
The fact that the home owner had cocked the hammer of the gun before he went downstairs indicated that his intentions where more than just to confront the burglar and hold him until the police arrived
In other words, he readied the gun to shoot before even knowing that he would be threatened
2) The ballistic evidence showed that the burglar was shot at some distance from the home owner, but the shots were fired before the burgler came close enough to pose a threat
My guess is that no judge in the US would even consider this case
The case illustrates that although you are within your rights to apply force to protect yourself in Norway, the threshold is quite high
Hunting licence with permission to keep weapons is easily accessible here
And if someone breaks in to your home you are allowed to do whatever to keep yourself and your family safe
But it will be a question about necessary force, not many situations calls for actually shooting a intruder
In Svalbard, Norway, it's mandatory to wear a rifle for self defence
...against polarbears
You’ll be sentenced anyway, the circumstance will only make the sentence milder, but when firearms are included most likely not much
There’s not much room for self defence in accordance to Norwegian criminal law at all, whatever you do and the circumstances are
Thank goodness burglars with chains saws are so rare
If you shoot someone you’ll definitively get a prison sentence, whatever the circumstances, but it might become milder because of the circumstances
I remember a case back in 2009, in Froland, where a guy killed an intruder
He was not sent to prison for any time
Edit: I looked it up and he did indeed get 1 year in prison even though there was nødverge present
I guess Finish criminal law is a bit different from our, even we’re both part of the Nordic legal tradition
In accordance to Norwegian criminal law there’s a very small room for self defence and response to provoked actions
Anders Behring Breivik used a legal Ruger 14 mini in the Utøya attack
He did use an illegal 20-round magazine
The law banning large magazines on semi-automatic rifles (I think it's 3+1) here in Norway has been in effect for decades and had nothing to do with terrorism
It's designed to prevent hunters from laying down a barrage of fire each autumn when the elk hunting season begins
Same regular police in rural areas as in the cities
We only have one type of police
Why is the millitary involved in policework on the countryside in France
Dont forget the Reindeer Police (Reinpolitiet)
We don't learn our history year by year
Excuse me, but do you only learn 300 years of history at school in the US
It's been a while since I left school, but we started with all the major Viking kings (1000 years ago) after a quick summary about the stone age and so on
Then we went on to the later middle age, Swedish/Danish rule, WW1, WW2, and some recent history
And probably a lot more I have forgotten now
What I remember the best is about the Viking kings, and a book written about a man having to hide during WW2
He was hiding in a snow cave because he was part of the resistance
A young girl (?) brought him food everyday
He got frost bite and had to cut his own toes off to survive
And he survived to write a book about it after the war
I think the book was called "9 liv" = "9 lives".
Maybe you're asking OP specifically but if you don't mind, I wanna make a guess
>!The black death arrived in Norway
Not much
Just a ship arriving in Björgvin
What if Haakon Magnus married Victoria and they became king and queen of Norway, and queen and king of Sweden, respectively
That would be awesome
Either 18 or 19 if you've spent the normal 3 years
Many people take a gap year or do the 1 year military service after that and before university
Yes
However you've gotta go through some stages before getting in
The first is just online, answering some questions
One of them is "do you want to go into the military", and if you answer "no" then there's little chance you'll get in
The next tests are physical
So basically if you don't want to, you're not getting in
In Norway you can basically dodge it nowadays simply if you're not motivated
So the mandatory conscription isn't quite as mandatory in practice, because they have enough people who actually are motivated each year
That varies a bit from year to year though
Drøbak is probably an abbreviation of "drøye bakker" which roughly means "long hills"
Tromsø: the "ø" is simply an older Danish-influenced spelling of "øy", meaning "island". Troms comes from the medieval name for the island the main settlement is located on, "Trums". The meaning is uncertain, but the most commonly accepted explanation is that it is connected to the word "strøm" (stream), referring to the waters surrounding the island
So the name means something like "stream-island".
I live on valderøy (Valder Island) and it's about 10 minutes away from Ålesund
The Island name comes from the viking age
There was a viking king living here called king Valder
The island i live in and the islands around it was a viking hot spot
Nesodden
Nes = headland (?), odde also headland if I'm correct
Odden was added due to many other places in Norway named Nes
Yes, Drjugbakki in old norwegian
I think Bergen actually is just a shortened version of Björgvin, like when you say it fast
For the record: Björg means mountain, vin means meadow
Vin is used in many other names
An important example is Vinland, which is what the Vikings named America upon discovery
As you can probably guess it means meadow land
Hanseatic low german influence goes brrrrrrrrr
The verb is "maler", and the sound is usually "prrr" with a rolling R, also in dialects that don't use rolling R's.
I see a lot of other countries have their word as a reference to a spindle
I wonder if our word is from grinding flour (male mel
That makes strangely much sense now that you mention it
I have never thought of it like that
It depends on what you wanna study, but I’ll go ahead and say NTNU for tech stuff, UiO if you wanna study medicine or law and UiT for Sami language and culture
NTNU
UIT actually has a fairly decent technology department
It's just that the ones with really good grades don't wanna move that far north
What about UiA
Kinda depends
NTNU is typically considered best for engineering subjects
NHH is most prestigious for business-related subjects
University of Oslo for law and possibly medicine as well
Not sure about other subjects
Yeah, I’m currently at NT-fak, it’s pretty good, and the professors and lecturers are amazing
Yes, "Nøkken" or the Nøkk if you wanna get grammatically correct
It was believed to live in small ponds just waiting for people to step in
Yes, "Nøkken" or the Nøkk if you wanna get grammatically correct
It was believed to live in small ponds just waiting for people to step in
Yes, "Nøkken" or the Nøkk if you wanna get grammatically correct
It was believed to live in small ponds just waiting for people to step in
Yes, "Nøkken" or the Nøkk if you wanna get grammatically correct

Any movie where the entire social order breaks down because the power is out for ten minutes or whatever
Most societies aren't that frail - not even the US, I suspect
In a national emergency, people would be trying to help each other, not robbing their neighbours for canned food at gunpoint
I'd say most of them
I think it's harder to find movies where the plot doesn't fall apart for some reason or another
Children's movies with psychopathic teachers (like Harry Potter, Matilda etc
Any teacher that's deliberately cruel and unfair to their students^(\*) would be out on their ass in a very short time
^(\* Yes, even that one teacher you used to hate
They weren't really as bad as you remember
Most of these apply to Europe in general
maybe they hibernate during the summer
During/after Dagmar our house didn't have power for three days lol
Glad to hear it
Hollywood probably does more to perpetuate the stereotypes against America than anything else
No, though there is a bit variety of dialects almost everyone understand eachother, but some of them might be a bit too obscure for some people to understand
We don't have a standard dialect
I might avoid using certain words when I talk to someone who isn't from Bergen, but i won't change my dialect
Nope
Keeping all dialects equally valid is actually enforced by law here
There is no standard dialect, but a lot of people would leave out the hardest parts of their dalects if they're not understood
While this is true - Norwegians talk to each other in their own dialects and I can't really see many situations where they'd switch or be asked to switch - foreigners usually learn the Standard Urban East Norwegian dialect, and it's somewhat of a de facto "standard" to fall back to if there's any need
I don’t know about other places, but here in northern Norway, speaking to immigrants in Bokmål is definetely common
It’s more effective than having them not understand my dialect
Well Nynorsk is a writing language (if that makes sense) so there is no official way of speaking it, but it’s not hard to read and easy to understand
Me too
I can actually remember doing this once; I for the life of me couldn't remember the proper Norwegian word for "bekkalokk" (kumlokk) so I just said "manhole cover" instead
I used to teach Norwegian to refugees in the north, and we would be told to speak similar to bokmål to make it easier comprehensible for the people learning
There might be some, but I have never seen any, so I assume it’s quite rare
Reminds me of listening to my uncle speak Pfälzisch
OOOF
> So norwegian dialects can be far apart enough that you'd use a lingua franca for the both of you
Not really, rather that to talk Norwegian in another dialect than our own is so unimaginable that even speaking another language is almost preferable
There is no standard dialect here, and even on TV you'll hear all sorts of strange dialects, so people are generally so used to them that we have an easier time understanding each other
People will tell you there is no standard dialect, but that is not really true, for most of Norway, speaking the way bokmål is written, would be considered standard
I’m not saying anyone actually speaks bokmål, but everyone knows and can speak that way
What the actual f are you on about
The only places you'll find people speaking bokmål non-ironically is Bærum and west-Oslo
I have never met anyone who wouldn't recoil at the idea of changing their dialects to bokmål.
I live in Northern Norway, I dont speak bokmål, but if youre asking for a standard dialect, bokmål is the closest thing there is
Im not saying people speak it, if you could read you would see that
Im saying it is as close to a «standard» dialect as it gets
In the same way that if you ask a German this question they will tell you there is a standard even though there are dialects
I dont see a difference between this and bokmål. You can pronounce bokmål.
Applience plugs
Laws on things concerning EU elections
Raspeballer/komle/kompe/klubb (depending on dialect)
Grated potato dumplings with a meat/fat/butter centre, that are simmered in water
Eaten with salted meat, pork knuckle or sausage, kohlrabi and butter
They have a similar thing in Sweden, I think its called Kroppkaka or Palt over there (again, depending on dialect)
On the west coast its usually eaten on a Thursday
Everyone has their own recipe, and you always think your dads/grandmothers/aunts etc etc makes the best komle (in my case, its my grandfathers recipe that's my favourite
He makes the Southern norwegian version (Kompe) that are extra large, extra white and filled with fat (med dott))
Any leftovers are cut up and fried off in a pan with butter so they crisp up
Delicious
I dont think we have
At least not similar to dumplings
Must be because dumplings are good
If you ask about terrible food I will be able to offer more
[Yes we do
Kompe / Kumle / Ball - with or without filling
Recipe on top is potatoe and flour dough, with sheep meet inside
No foreigners like it, but those of us who grew up with it LOVE it
You west coast people are weird
They're great, but I don't think they resemble "dumplings" as defined in this thread very well
Ribbe vs Pinnekjøtt for dinner at Christmas day
Golden or (yikes
) red Christmas soda
[I think someone wants to talk to you about that]
Christmas eve ;)
\#TEAMRIBBE
Ribbe
Pinnekjøtt is just foul smelling and not very good tasting, either
The milk should be left out, no need for that
Team golden representing
brown is NOT the couler of jul
Shit
I guess my urge to slap some sense into you only further validates the comment
BOI I don't know what type of pinnekjøtt you've had, but the trick is to make it just right with natural sticks (not the ones you buy at the store), the right side dish and, of course, a good glass of the right beer (IPA)
Boo
I'm evil
its KJ in norwegian
(or just K)
Actually separate taps is what I have too
Even more local than country, but region where I'm from, [Basse]
Scouts often play a game which I'm not sure how to spell, but it's pronounced like "kappelan" with a Norwegian 'E'. The game goes as follow:
All participants stand normally in a circle
One person use a knife, axe or sharp stick and try to throw it into the ground next to someone else
The person closes to it has to put one foot next to where it landed (as long as it's standing still)
Then that person does the same to someone else
If you throw it in between someone's feet, they have to do a 180° and land with their feet in the same places
The goal of the game is to not fall or trip over and therefore be the last man standing
The strategy is to spread people's legs the most and then do the 180°-thing
It's really fun and a bit dangerous :D
[Dødsing] or Death Diving, is popular here
Trøndelag
In Norway its 8 pm on weekdays and 6 pm on saturdays
There is no buffer bc everyone knows about the limit and if you really need beer you should be able to get there before 6/8
I just used the insert link button on mobile, blame reddit
Hah I've never heard of it outside Norwegian scouts :D
Same over here
Alchohol sale from grocery stores 09-20 weekdays, 09-18 saturdays, closed sunday
Other rules apply for Vinmonopolet (more restrictive) and bars/restaurants/clubs (less restricrive)
God forbid we'd be able to get something to drink after 18 on saturdays
That law is absolutely insanely unnecessary
Yes, you can plan ahead, but sometimes time runs out, or you get invited to a party and need to grab a sixer or some wine on the way
Always
And thats just for beer and cider below 5%.
It's not alloud to sell anything stronger in stores
If you want to buy anything stronger like wine, spirits etc
You have to go to "Vinmonopolet" which is a state run alcohol monopoly
That usually close between 17 and 18 on weekdays and 15 on saturdays
It's not alloud to sell alcohol on sundays exept for in bars and resturants
Edit: This is meant to lower exsessive and/or impulsive drinking
I don't know if it works or not
Grocery stores in general are closed on sundays, and the ones allowed to be open (smaller than a certain size) are not allowed to sell alcohol on sundays and red days (public holidays)
The same rules apply for Vinmonopolet
Yeah I don't think it works either, but as I said, I don't really know
What I do know is that a lot of people are okey with the state alcohol monopoly, but not with the rules around beer and cider

I really want to take a road trip to Belarus
It has been in my mind for years
Unsure why, perhaps just because it's a place you rarely hear about and it is within reasonable distance
No I don't speak Russian, and no I'm not sure if it is a good idea but still I really want to do it
And I love their sense of humour
> I have a huge crush on France and I'm not afraid to admit it
I cant believe you said that OUT LOUD
I would like to roadtrip Portugal
I've been to Lagos and i want to see more
Scots are not very good at taking compliments
Now, you’re also a favourite of mine
My first visit to South Africa was about 10 years after apartheid ended
Thanks for the tip  i wish i could give suggestions on where to go in Norway but i haven't traveled enough in my own country to know
Aalesund is great though
That's where i live
If you ever visit Aalesund, DM me and i will tell you the best places to visit in the area
> and we've also got that Northern European thing where being openly pleased proud is frowned upon
Oh, I thought that was a Nordic thing only
A Norwegian passport all day
Especially with the new ones coming
Nice try but the Swedish one specifically used the word for a labor union, and the Danish one uses a generic word that also could mean a labor union or something like "association" (or "society" as in "student society")
I think "unionen" would be more specific and correct in both languages
Hode, skulder, kne og tå,
kne og tå
Hode, skulder, kne og tå,
kne og tå
Øyne, ører, kinn å klappe på!
Hode, skulder, kne og tå, kne og tå!!
Knee and toe instead of knees and toes
And we say 'eyes, ears and cheeks that you can clap' where in the song you would then be clapping you cheeks
Its a fun Norwegian variation
Today I learned that the Irish have their own language
The song is stuck in my head now :D
Æ aswell, only place I still see it is in [Encyclopædia Britannica] although Latin
Vidkun Quisling
I've heard people from *other countries* call *their* traitors Quislings, that should tell you something
For those who might not know, he was Hitler's Norwegian nazi lapdog
He even kinda looks like Hitler, just without the mustache
He served as PM from 1942 until the war ended, but tried to take power through a coup d'état a few years before that, over the radio no less
tl;dr - traitorous nazi
Vidkun Abraham Quisling
A norwegian Nazi
Excecuted for treason after WWII
I'm reading about him now to brush up on my history and it's really, *really* funny
He called the Colonel at Elverum where the government was hiding and ordered him to "arrest the Marxist government" and he told Quisling to fuck off
He told the Chief of Police in Oslo to prepare a conference and was told to fuck off
He then told the Norwegian Shipowner Association to alert all ships to stay away from Allied harbors, and he was told to fuck right off
He had pretty much zero support in the Norwegian population
Sometimes I think US women are tougher than the rest of us
I have twins, so I'm part of a twin facebook group where mothers can ask for advice
And there are constantly US women going back to work after 6 weeks or 9 weeks or something
And they're not even complaining about it
I'm also part of a Norwegian group, where women CONSTANTLY complain about having to go back to work after 7-8 months
Especially when the baby refuses to take a bottle or whatever
(And for the record I'm one of those who think that after the last change in parent leave dads have gotten a too big chunk of it
True, but I'm still impressed by the fact that very few of them seem to complain about it
Yes it's great
Although some of us feel it was better before the last change (some of mum's weeks were given to dad)
But another GREAT change happened in June last year, where parents of twins got a longer leave than those giving birth to one child
I feel so lucky that my twins were born after June
Having twins is much harder work than having one baby, so I fully agree on the extra weeks given
Sorry you didn't get more time off work
How long is parent leave for the mothers in Switzerland
Some nurseries do take in newborns in the US
But my impression is that often the grandmother steps in, or they hire a nanny
> In Switzerland women get a standard 4 months
That is surprisingly short
(Here it's 14 months parent leave when having twins)
Are any of your political parties working on extending it
> I don't think there is a push to extend maternity leave,
Is it common for mothers to work
Or do many stay at home with the children while they are young
It's the same as in English, except we say "stein, Saks, papir" which makes it "rock, scissors, paper".
So if I've understood it correctly:
- Well beats rock and scissors
- Paper beats rock and well
- Scissors beats paper
- Rock beats scissors
There's no reason to ever pick rock, so doesn't the game just become well, paper, scissors
[€246 per person per month] NB: That includes only grocery shopping, and not restaurant visits

I spent a little over 100 last month, but I was saving
Not a world leader, but a Lithuanian talk show claimed that the Norwegian state kidnapped foreign children to get fresh blood because we have "the highet inbreeding in the world".  [
Also not a foreign leader, but after Breivik's massacre on July 22, 2011 a Fox News host/anchor asked if Norway was really a democracy because our police didn't carry guns
When a norwegian journalist asked the newly appointed ambassador to Norway, by Obama, some basic questions
He thought the capital of Norway was Sweden
He thought our progressive party, one of the two parties in government, were a terrorist nazi group
I also think he thought Norway had vikings because we are an island
Fair to say, Obama didn't give him the job in the long run
And the guy Trump appointed actually know a lot
The only out of 20 questions a journalist asked him and he got wrong was that he didn't think Norway bordered Russia, that Finland still held Petsamo
So a good score for a random foreigner tbh
Oh man, all the ignorance floating in the media and social media after the terrorist attack in Norway still gives me a headache
There are STILL *TONS* of people across the world who believe Breivik will be let out of prison after 21 years because of the dishonest narrative the foreign media ran with
There's a lot of misinformation about our child protective services in foreign media, in particular in the former East Bloc countries it would seem
I've heard misinformation coming from Romania, Russia and Bulgaria too, although not only regarding this matter
The Russians have some "interesting" theories about how we constantly spy on them
In any case, if you look up "Barnevernet" (name of our child protective services) in foreign media there's a lot of misinformation
Of course, our system isn't perfect and maybe in some cases our child protective services are too quick to make a conclusion, but generally I don't think it's bad to consider the safety of children
My impression from reading thought the comments so far:
- Nordics: No
- West and central Europe: Maybe
- South and east: Yes
For a moment there I thought everybody agreed to it
I agree with you
Citizenship comes with certain privileges, and this is one of them
For the same reason I totally agree with the fact that prisoners who are citizens should be able to vote as well, even while in prison

«Det finnes ikke dårlige vær, bare dårlig klær.»
It means There is no bad weather, only bad clothing
We love to go on walks no matter the weather and I think this is primarily said to kids to force them to go for a walk no matter the weather
Norwegian has "frisk som en fisk", (healthy like a fish), and I always thought that was a case of rhyming making the saying (a bit like Dutch "helaas pindakaas" - literally "unfortunately, peanut butter"), but if Polish has the same without the rhyme maybe not
Are fish really that healthy
Could be, I've taken a bus (and ferry from Sweden) to get to Poland, it's not that far compared to other countries in Europe, so something is bound to have come over, the other way too
The Norwegian word for taxi cab (drosje - sj makes a shh sound, final e is a schwa) is very clearly a Slavic loan word, and most people in Norway live closer to Poland than they do to Russia, even if we technically share a border
It means "too bad", and "peanut butter" rhymes with "unfortunately" in Dutch
I can in Scandinavia
Can do fine in Sweden and Denmark, sometimes Finland too
I frequently travel to Denmark and Sweden without using a single English word
Sweden and Denmark
I can speak a (very) little bit of german too
I would understand 99% of swedish and 3% of Danish
they sound like they have a potato in their throat
Is it okay to ask Finns if they speak Swedish, or is it rude
Nothing difficult about that
If anything it's easier than some Swedish dialects, as it's pretty clear
It's interesting because it kinda sounds like a Swedish version of an inner Finnmark dialect
I think Finland-Swedish are some of the best sounding Swedish dialects
In the case of that video, it's very easily understood since she enunciates very clearly, but other Finnish-Swedish dialects are close to impossible to understand
The woman in the video above is 100% understandable, that guy is about 20% understandable
He's clearly using a lot of local words, but the words that are "regular" Swedish are easy to understand
It reminds me of certain Norwegian dialects which are completely impossible to understand because they use so many local words
Then they switch to more common words instead, and you understand them perfectly
Driving into Sweden isn’t any hassle, on the larger crossings there’re custom offices which you might need to slow down through, sometimes there might be controls, but other than that nothing at all
By plane within Schengen there’re often no passport controls or anything
Last time I went to Italy through Frankfurt my passport wasn’t controlled once before I came to my hotel
Passports are sometimes controlled at gate, but nothing more than a glance
Norway-sweden crossing you have to slow down, and there are occational checks
I dont think i have been pulled over in my last 10-15 border crossings, but that is anecdotal of course
The checks are mainly to inspect the amount of alcohol and tobacco coming from the swedish side (EU) to the norwegian side, which is not i the EU, as alcohol and tobacco is considerably cheaper in sweden
On the Norwegian-Finnish border you do need to slow down while passing the customs (entirely on the Norwegian side), but not while passing the border itself
There are routine checks, but I've never been stopped
Going to Finland is pretty much as routine as a trip abroad can get, you can also cross by snowmobile
Very easy
There are no people living around at my nearest border control, you should travel slower sometimes, it is harmless
But you still have the feeling of the police stopping you, even though you know that's not happening
They could stop you only if they find out, with their sensors, that you have large amounts of illegal stuff in your vehicle
If you're a pedestrian, this doesn't apply
Hopefully
depending on where you cross it’s not even noticable
if you drive over to sweden in the more rural parts it’s literally just a bridge
there are some checkpoints for tolls but as far as i remember there’s barely any actual security
I can walk straight to sweden if i want

On my laptop I've had [this] picture for years
I have no idea where it came from
I've probably had it as my wallpaper for like 10 years
My phone has a picture of the [London Eye] as the lock screen and [my dog] as the unlocked screen
My laptop is a small Star Trek logo on a light blue background witch is what I see
When I mainly used two monitors and a tower not my laptop I used to have cooler stuff, because I saw them but now I don’t care
I switch whatever I have as a phone background whenever I stumble over something I like, currently it’s Gerald from The Witcher tv-show, but I will probably change it to something abstract in the near future

Of course it's Sweden
Sweden
And sometimes Denmark
But mostly Sweden
There's a line of jokes called "the swede, the Dane and the Norwegian". They are often competing in something very strange, and the swede and the Dane always fucks up because they're stupid, and the Norwegian wins because he's smart
Sweden
Sweden
But it's just brotherly love
Denmark
Same
Let’s not forget Denmark
I quess Sweden
How do you sink a frigate
You hire Norwegian crew
(We accidentally sunk two frigates the last 24 years)
It's funny, I've heard most of these but with norway replaced with sweden instead
Do the Belgians call you stupid
Because Norway and Sweden make the exact same jokes about each other
I have never noticed this before, but quite a few of these jokes involve doors
There is for instance one that goes:
- Why do Swedes leave the door open when going to the bathroom
So that no one can peep through the key hole
Denmark is like that retarded cousin you don't make fun of because it would just be mean
^^^\(sorry)
We don't really make fun of Denmark much
How many times have you heard a "danskevits"? I think I have heard more jokes about Finns than about Danes
Danes are just the average guys in the "The Swede, the Dane and the Norwegian" style of jokes
Hvilken militær makt da
Husk at det er vi som er i NATO her
But at least you've got a fully lit highway system so that you can see the potholes, right
Yup
Yes our jokes are absolutely only about Sweden, but have you ever talked about Denmark and not cracked a joke about the potato they have stuck in their throats
Worked with some Estonians, to me it sounded like finnish with some russian in it
They did not like the part about sounding russian
As long as you're not taunting your favorite neighbor to the north, it's fine by us
Only once and it was because the King of Norway and Sweden married the Queen of Denmark
After the dissolution of the Kalmar Union it would of course continue as Denmark-Norway, why wouldn't it it was only one royal family
I can't really remember any jokes right now, but I remember my friends dad from the north of Norway often told jokes about Finns
The jokes normally involve two characters, Pekka and Toivonen who live near lake Enare
The jokes are about them being able to drink huge amounts of heavy alcohol, that they are hard and tough, that they are a little simple in their ways and that Finns are sexually liberal but also introvert and not a people of many words
I think some of the predjudices Norwegians hold against Finns come from Finnish television plays that were aired on Norwegian state tv, NRK
The plays were extremely wierd and dull, and Finnish television play has become synonymous with something broing and incomprehensible
One difference from the jokes about Swedes is that some of the jokes paint the Finns in a very positive light
Example of a Finn joke:
Pekka and Toivonen were drinking vodka at a pub near lake Enare
"Cheers
", said Pekka
"Are we drinking or are we talking
", said Toivonen angrily
6°C. I would like it to be around 22 so it's a little chilly for me
About 21 °C, which is just about the right temperature
Below 18 °C starts being chilly
Below 16 °C is cold
I have a fairly new and well insulated home, and the living room has gas fireplace with timer and thermostat
I set it to give a bit of heat at 16 o clock, which usually lasts all night, especially if I cook a meal
If the sun shines, the fireplace needn't light up because the large windows absorb lots of heat
We usually keep indoor temperature around 20 for most rooms
My bedroom is 16°C. Just perfect
1°C right now and 40% humidity
Everything below 20° is a bit cold
Around 15° is perfect for a bedroom at night, preferably a tad colder
Currently 17° C. I'd prefer a couple of degrees warmer
I am in my bathroom, so here it is 25,5
In the rest of the house, around 20-21
23 degrees right now, but have it set for 25
I like being almost nekkid
20⁰-ish somewhere
A bit warmer in my bedroom than I usually like, my partner keeps shutting the windows (I like to sleep with the windows open all year, he doesn't)
Nothing like a crisp, cold bedroom
Rest of the house is a bit chillier than usual at about 20⁰. Its started to dip to 0⁰ and below now here on the west coast of Norway, which is when I usually have to bump the heating up a little as the floor heating is no longer quite enough to take the slight chill out of the air
That said, I've lived in the UK and Australia, and its *much* colder in the houses in winter due to shoddy insulation
19°, just cold enough to be uncomfortable, but not cold enough for me to actually change it
23 rn and perfect
Anything below 21 is cold
Bedroom is cold though, around 15 and sometimes lower if it's cold outside; window is always open
>But also have seen people from Northern Europe saying that 26-27º outside is really hot
That's so weird and I can't understand
Yeah I don't understand that either
26-27º is freaking nice
Then again I don't like cold weather
#cursed
Well, I've got a thermometer in my room
I have the temperature at a nice 23-24 usually, and I always wear shorts and a t-shirt inside
We’d like to keep our fishing rights, like the Swede said
We voted no to joining twice
Voting yes would be shooting ourselves in the foot for the Norwegians outside cities and probably kill of whole communities
We couldn't compete with industrial farms down in Europe or accept the EU fishing policy
[As seen in the map] of the vote, only areas next to towns around Oslo, west and Trondheim voted yes
We certainly don't want to be a part of the EU, and resistance to the EEA as well is growing, especially with how the current government forced the ACER deal
A major reason that is not mentioned, if we were to join the EU now we would have to convert to the Euro currency, and abolish the krone
In other words we would loose control over our monetary policy
This isn´t necessary a bad thing as we would have a more stable currency that would make us more competitive in the global economy
However, there is a major problem, our economy is fundamentally different (Germany makes cars, etc
) from the large players in the EU that control the monetary policy for the Euro
Not only are we different, but we are polar opposites from the likes of Germany, who makes cars and we export oil
When the oil prices are high, that is bad for the German automobile industry, but good for the Norwegian oil and gas industry
Hence Germany is motivated to stabilize the economy with monetary policy at completely different stages of the economic cycle than Norway
In other words, there are quite natural causes why we are not in the EU, and this is something the EU recognizes, hence the pretty decent EEA cooperation
Short answer: Because we don't want to
We don't want to get in
We see no point in joining the EU
We've voted on it in 1972 and in 1994
Both times, the "no"-side won with 53
5% and 52
2%. My guess is that if we were to have another voting now, the "no"-side would be win again with a larger majority
It has shrunk a lot since then though
Norwegians would mind a part of Serbia being Norwegian, though
We're not joining the EU
That is not an issue
Why should we
We’ve only had that twice - 1972 and 1994
So certainly not every 10 years
No way
We would like to stay a sovereign state
The EU resistance movement is too strong here
I think the lastest polls show 70 % against, 20 % for, and 10 % undecided
No big deal
I like it as it currently is
Because we’d like to have Norwegian goods; Norwegian milk and so on
I’d certainly be a reason for the “no” side to hopefully win
Although I hope o never have to vote about it
I don't think it includes the right to acquire real estate
The wiki page doesn't seem to mention it and I know Denmark has restrictions on it
> No big deal
I like it as it currently is
Me too
We're not interested in joining the EU
Correct
I certainly hope not
I mean, we might, in the future, but I hope it’s not when I’m alive
It does not indeed, which is why leading figures are now talking about leaving the EEA
As the other guy above me is saying, the left parties, Rødt and SV and probably the Labor Party as well, is campaigning for leaving the EEA
There are only minor complaints when people run into some sort of EU regulation that they don't understand the point of
Like my brother helped building a public playground, and they had to follow (in his words) some ridiculous EU standards
Mostly people are perfectly fine with the status quo
There are always some that want to join, and some that don’t. I’ve never had a discussion about it, besides in my political science class in high school
And I haven’t ever really heard people complaining about it either
There are legitimate discussions
The biggest subdivision of the biggest trade union have come out against the EEA
It might result in the entire trade union changing their view to be against the EEA
The trade union has over one fifth of our population as members and their opinion cannot be ignored by any leftist government, which we probably will get after next parliament election
Well
The thing about Brexit is that there seems to be no plan whatsoever
Some don’t want anything do to with the EU
They don’t seem to come to an agreement
That is seen as a giant mistake
We are
I support Brexit since it's the will of the people of Britain made manifest
If they want to leave the EU, then I don't see why they shouldn't be able to
Yes
Or at least most people
I'm happy with the norway not being a full member and would like it to stay that way
But I think eu is great and the best thing to happen in Europe the last centuries
I cant understand how a country can willingly do that to themselves
> I mean it's easy to check from Sweden and Finland which arguments are real and which ones are myths
Sweden is hardly the best example of thriving rural areas though
How's Bulgaria these days
Yeah
That’s exactly why
That and that people are generally just more anti-EU and anti-EEA now
I think it’s 70/20/10 (against/for/unsure) for joining the EU
It’s certainly not gonna get better now that the UK is leaving
Leaving the EEA is a semi-big issue for the most left political parties like Rødt (Red) and SV (Socalist Left-Party), this time among the local elections which are happening in just a week
Not necessarily, but if they had some kind of plan that they could agree on
Going to a website "språkrådet" (Language council of Norway) i found a list of "words of the year" which is a new word or a word with new origins which has been prevalent that year
List started in 2008 so might as well take them all in
* 2008: "Finanskrise" (Financial crisis)
Not a new word (1947), but it was hardly used until this year
* 2009: "Svineinfluensa" (Swine flu)
No brainer, the big thing that year
* 2010: "Askefast" (Ash stuck)
Eyjafjallajökull
* 2011: "Rosetog" (Rose train)
July massacre
* 2012: "Å nave" (To "use" the norwegian social services)
Basically, a lot of people were though to be using the Norwegian social services just because they could, and not because something were actually wrong with them so much that they couldnt work
* 2013: "Sakte tv" (Slow TV)
24/7 live show from Hurtigruta while it sailed from Bergen to Kirkenes
* 2014: Fremmedkriger (Foreign warrior)
That wrod itself is new in Norwegian, but there are other older words which have been used in the past
* 2015: "Det grønne skiftet" (The green change)
Climate change and all that stuff
* 2016: "Hverdagsintegrering" (Everyday integration)
What people to in their normal days to help integrate immigrants/refugees into our society
* 2017: "Falske nyheter" (Fake news)
Donald Trump
* 2018: "Skjebnelandsmøte" (Fate congress, direct translation)
In Norwegian politics, it was a huge thing going on that could potentionally fuck up the government
We call the same pute-TV, pillow TV
I like the new Norwegian word "rekkeviddeangst" (range anxiety) which is the anxiety electric car owners have for running out of power
Like what
That last one made me snort
After the 2017 election three rightwing parties formed a coalition, Høyre, Venstre and FRP
However, they were a minority government, and to pass anything they needed the support of the The Christian democrat party
Internally in the Christian democrat party, however, there was a debate
Many members supported fully joining the rightwing coalition government, but many supported joining the left and establishing a new government
The party leader supported aligning the party with the left while the second in command wanted to align them towards the right
This all was decided at the Christian party’s national congress (landsmøte)
At said meeting they decided to join the rightwing in their coalition government and since then they have been incredibly unpopular, struggling to get above 2
5% in the polls
Basically, one of the parties in power ("KRF") had a congress
They would vote if they wanted to support "Høyre" which was (still is) the dominant party in power at that time
I did not follow this much at all but the rundown is something along these lines
&#x200B;
KRF had a congress, would vote to support Høyre, or leave them to join the opposition parties
If they left Høyre, and joined the opposition, the opposition parties would vote to remove Erna Solberg (Høyre) as prime minister
At KRF's congress, the final vote was to stay with Høyre, and as such the leader of KRF had to (or had said in advance) that he would leave his position
It's a lot more to it than what i said above
KRF is also a party in heavy decline, but needed by Høyre (along with other parties) to keep power
Well they are liberal
Back in the day (prior to the labour party) they were the left in Norway
Now days not so much
(For those who don’t speak a scandinavian language “Venstre” means “left”)
Well
depends, the most likely thing to happend to you is if there is a moose roaming, those things are scary
For the rest, nah, i wouldnt be too worried
But those mooses
for real
Bergen, Norway: I don't remember ever being worried about safety
Obviously, crime is not 0, but it is not at a rate where I have to even start thinking of looking over my shoulder
I go on walks most evenings, between 20:00 and 23:00 and I have abseloutley zero worries of anything happening to me
I consider it virtually exactly as safe as walking during midday
It's one of the biggest cities in Norway but it's very safe
Never had problems myself or heard from others
In general this applies to 99
9% of the country not just my city
Small town of approx 20k inhabitants
If you stay away from the bar street, you're golden
I don't think anyone's been robbed on the streets here
Some might have been knocked down by a drunk/drugged idiot, but that's pretty rare, at least un-provoked
[The Hardanger Fiddle] is our national musical instrument, it is a violin with sympathetic strings underneath the playing strings
examples of use would be [the rohan theme] and this [folk song]
Learned about this instrument when I was a young boy reading Don Rosa's story about Sampo
That comic is basically most of my knowledge about Finland now that I think about it
Langeleik is also a Norwegian instrument, but less used and not «the national instrument».
I also thought of the "munnharpe" (mouth harp)
Funny enough, I very recently saw that there is an indigenous instrument in Taiwan that has the *exact* same sound as the mouth harp
It's just shaped a bit differently and the playing technique is a bit different, but they have the same sound
They use older instruments of broader Scandinavian/Nordic origins, such as the tagelharpa and goat horn
Einar Selvik (frontman of Wardruna, and other projects of his) is a damn national treasure, I love his music so much
Yes
One of the members (Eilif Gundersen) was actually one of my teachers during my first year at high school a few years back, teaching drawing of al things
Great teacher and even greater person
At the time I had no idea he was part of the band that produced the music for Vikings
When the Nazis tried to invade Oslo in 1940, they had to sail past a fortress that was strategically important for Norway
In the days before, there was a lot happening in Norwegian waters so when the first ship sailed in early I'm the morning, the soldiers at the fortress did not know if it was british, german or from somewhere else
The commander, Colonel Birger Eriksen, was asked what to do and he replied with two great quotes: "Damn straight we're firing live ammunition
" and "Either I’ll be court-martialed or else I will be a war hero, Fire
It turned out to be the German heavy cruiser *Blücher*. The fortress sank it with two torpedoes
The rest of the German fleet turned around and went ashore further south
This gave the Norwegian King and government enough time to flee with the gold reserves
There was a great movie made some time ago with this battle as the opening scene:
Its not a city, rather a group of small islands of the coast
Our most notable event has to be the famous norwegian priest, called Petter Dass, was born here
Its only got a population of 1800
Drøbak, Norway
Oscarsborg Fortress sunk the German Cruiser 'Blucher' and halted Operation Weserubung on April 9th 1940
This allowed the royal family and the government to have enough time to escape by train northwards
Trondheim
Probably the building of Nidarosdomen between 1070 and 1300, it became the most important church in Norway and according to the constitution the place where monarch shall get crowned until we abolished that act
I would guess you're famous for [limericks] as well
I was thinking more along the lines of the 2015 Ski World Championship
Speaking as a Norwegian I can't think of any similar estate or institution that wholly owns the rights to the author's work (living authors probably being the exception here), although we do have produced many great, influential authors over time as well
My favourites
Loved reading both the books and watching the movies
Oh there are too many, but here are some that come to mind:
Do = toilet
Store = big(plural)
Bad = bathroom
Fart = speed
Pupper(another word for puppy) = boobs
God = good
Barn = child
Her = here
Sure = sour(plural)
Dress = suit
Boss = trash(in the west)
And the popular one:
Gift = married/poison
Norwegian rally racer Petter Solberg's English is infamously bad
There was a skit about him where he said "It's not the fart that kills you, it's the smell", which frankly wouldn't be too much of a surprise if it was a real quote, considering:
Fart=speed
Smell=bang
Fag is like school subject
Fart means speed and smell means the sound something makes when you hit it on something
Someone said this "it's not the fart that kills you it's the smell"
I speak a mix of English and Norwegian to my boyfriend
*kokk* means chef in Norwegian too but is pronounced like cock
He finds it hilarious, so he never corrects me
So even to this day I just mix it at the wrong time
Result:
''I wonder if X restaurant has some nice cocks over there, I heard they make fushion
Gift means both poison and married in Norwegian
"Rape" - to burp
"After" - mouth ulcers
"Smell" - bang (not *that* kind of bang), loud sound
Fat = a tray
Mat = food
Have = garden (old people say that)
I remember going to Sweden as a kid, I always thought kiss was so funny
We still have it, you guys changed the spelling (husbond(e) vs husband)
Not exactly
The infinitive form would be "å gifte"
(where "å" in this setting is the norwegian equalent of "to" in "to marry")
Gift is the adjective form when it comes to the word for married, "de er gift" = "they are married"
It’s the noun form when it comes to the word for poison
(I hope this made sense, I’m sorry if it didn’t)
Rape means 'to burp' in Norwegian :)
Yeah, we also have "medgift" as dowry
Some people will be annoyed by the sheer amount of tourists in their home city
There's no avoiding that, and it's not your fault - if there are too many tourists, the fault lies with the government who has failed to regulate it, which means it's ultimately the responsibility of the locals themselves
Looking at you, *Venice*.
You asking this question already shows you’re aware and respectful
Have a nice trip, and welcome
If you ask someone "How are you
", they will (hopefully) reply, but they will probably not remember that they are supposed to ask you back instead of explaining to you how they are actually doing
A simple "hei" (prunonced "Hey") in these parts of the world will actually be more than enough when for instance approaching the person behind the counter of a shop
> Also, use your inside voice outside and your outside voice inside
What a clever way of putting it
Never thought about explaining it that way
> I'm shuddering at imagining how rude I'd be in Alabama if I just barked out "hey" to whoever was behind the counter
It's because it has a different meaning
Here it means "hello"  :)
Couldn't you say "hi there" with a smile
Or would that still be slightly rude
Using outside voice inside is not disturbing anyone, so feel free to speak as loud as you wish
Using inside voice while being outside in public is the polite thing to do
Extremely annoying having to listen to someone else's (loud) conversation while on the bus for instance
(That includes someone speaking on the phone with a loud voice)
I found this annoying aswell when I was in amsterdam (as a turist) I only smoked in a secluded part of a park, as if it was illegal
In my defence I think it is illegal to smoke in public in Amsterdam, but im not clear on the rules
> “Excuse me, sir/ma’am” would be the standard way to call someone’s attention
We would say "ynskyld" (means both 'exuse me' and 'sorry') to get their attention
If we already have their attention, "hi"and a smile is enough
Calling someone sir/maam however is not under any circumstances a common thing to do
We address everyone and anyone by first name; the doctor, the teacher, the lawyer, the prime minister
Talking ABOUT them however we might add doctor so and so, or prime minister Erna (that's her first name)
But this is just to easier explain who we are talking about
I imagine Scandinavians might step on many toes when moving elsewhere where you are supposed to be more formal
But its been like this since the 70's, so by now we know no other way up here
I was quite shocked when I found out my girlfriend (German) preferred sweet popcorn
I didn't even think this existed
As a Norwegian, I've only eaten salty popcorn
I like both
Having grown up in both UK and Norway we had toffee popcorn in the UK that is sweet, and then the salty in Norway
Later I found out about using coconut oil and flavacol, I cant go back to regular salted
definitely not
"In Europe you don't have free speech
"Private gun ownership is not allowed in Europe".
"No free speech"
"Socialist Europe"
Probably anything coming from right-wngers in the USA who think we'e all socialist, godless hellholes overrun with Muslims, getting Aloha snackbared every week and living under Shakira Law (May Her Hips Never Lie)
Well, at least it's what they think of Western Europe
That it's possible for previously communist countries to be concidered anything other than eastern europe
Oddly enough, a lot of right-wingers in the USA seem to love Eastern Europe now because you're all super white and anti-immigrant, and you don't tolerate homosexuality as much
Basically, you're portrayed as the opposite of Western Europe (rich but decadent, too liberal, weak)
"Also, you're overrun by Muslims while being extremely homogenous
Yes, I've heard that one several times too
Then I usually show them the [Press Freedom Index]
Another one is: private gun ownership is not allowed in Europe
(so not sure how they believe we kill the deer and moose
Bow and arrow
“Your policies only work because you have like 10

Do you know where this stereotype comes from
It would be sort of understandable if English-speakers were the only pale-skinned folks who had a significant presence in the East Asian region, but Taiwan had a Dutch presence for a while, Indonesia even longer, the French were in Indochina, plus the various foreign concessions in mainland China and the Russian Empire/Soviet Union/Russian Federation directly to the north of both China and Japan, where they even use a different script
You'd think people would have noticed that all these pale foreigners do not speak the same language
I don't think there is a stereotype that everyone with East Asian features are native speakers of Mandarin Chinese or whatever
same, i wish they were thought a little more about the rest of the world in america
> • "In Europe there is nudity in cereal commercials" - visited Scandinavia (it was a bank commercial, not cereals
I once took an American friend to [the Vigeland park in Oslo] He was a very cool, outgoing 18 year old guy at the time
And the park **really** embarrassed him
Which I found so surprising at the time
to be fair, the british islands have always been sort of seperated from the redt of europe
i too would group the UK into european, but when someone asks me to name some european nations, you don’t come up first, ya know
Got to love how many African nations are better than the US in this index
> Oh, I even heard that countries like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are communist
I know
The argument is often "You have socialistic health care". and then I reply: "But you have socialistic public school".
And then we take it from there
I happen to live next to a shooting range
> I think Americans consider any restrictions on firearms equivalent to a ban
There are restrictions in the US as well though
In many of the states, if the police discover a handgun in my hand bag that I have no licence to carry I will get a large fine, or even risk going to prison
Also that the US is the only country in the world that has free speech as part of their constitution
(Their're not
For instance Norway, where I live, has had it as a law since 1814)

This does indeed happen:
[Catalan reporter told he is not white in the US]
[Picture of the guy in question] Looks like a fairly standard Southern European/Mediterranean look to me, but apparently that is un-white in North America
No, but the way i see it, geography is a science, so there is not room for disagreement on techincalities
The UN, the West and my culture claims that eastern europe = countries that used to be communist*. It's just so stupid and pointless to argue otherwise just to try to get concidered "good"(aka western), when that only undermines the country's history and geopolitical role/historical situation
/r/fakehistoryporn stuff
Yeah
It's a very dangerous situation if you reach a point where everyone have free speech, except journalists
Then how will the public get to know what is really going on
I did not expect his reaction at all
I mean - they are made of stone
i would say all the nordics, former soviet states, turkey and the UK are the 'outliers’ of europe
technically they’re european, but at the same time they have a pretty distinct culture and thus are 'not as european’ i guess
The latter is so ridiculous it's brilliant
In jokes like these i laugh just as much of the unrealistic stereotype as the joke, its just funny that people might beleive this is real
&#x200B;
I can't fint the clip, but Norway is mentioned several times in the Simpsons, one including some CIA ageent talking to Lisa, something about pressing her for some information, Lisa is ofcourse resisting and claiming her rights, where the agent talk about something patriotic and telling Lisa about other countries being worse of and people having to eat bugs to survive
Lisa rebutes: "What countries
and the agent replies: "Ever been to Norway
Lisa: "No
Agent: "Well they eat bugs in Norway"
A bit noisy
But luckily the shooting range is not in constant use
> Is it actually legal in Norway to own guns like hangun
Yes it's legal
What is illegal is owning a non-registered gun
(But it's not like Americans have free range either
In many states, if the police find a non-licenced gun in my hand bag I face a large fine or even prison
Does that mean that some Americans only view certain parts in the US as "free"? (If yes, do they plan to march over the borders to set the other states free
mmm yes this whole thing is probably something stemming from cold war propaganda
> Besides why should it be up to the west to determine how the east prefers to be known
Are you claiming that *basic geography* is a hoax made up by the capitalist west to undermine the then Soviet Union and it's allies for all time to come
> Exactly I live near Luxembourg and hating Portuguese people seems to be the norm
Why
[Serious question]
>  ..prevent anyone from legally carrying a firearm inside
Can you carry a gun where-ever you want outside (in your state)
> Does it seriously hurt western pride so much to say central europe when in the countries that prefer that term
This is where the historical perspective is importiant for the explenation
Of course the poles/early slavs lived in some of the areas that are Germany today (like there lived germans in modern western Poland rip) but the teutons (proto-germans) conquered the land right, thus essentially delcaring a perpetual race-war on the slavs
Now claiming that the teutons and slavs belong to the same culture and geographical region is just absurd and frankly it feels like a desperate move by the EU to balance the regions and satisfy people like you
> crime rate for concealed carriers is lower
According to this the crime rate went up:
*"The most comprehensive, and arguably most
rigorous, study on the effects of RTC laws was
recently published by economists John Donohue
(Stanford), Abhay Aneja (University of California,
Berkeley), and Kyle Weber (Columbia)
Donohue
and colleagues found that violent crime rates
increased with each additional year a RTC
law was in place, presumably as more people
were carrying guns on their person and in their
vehicles
b,10 By years 7 through 10 following the
adoption of a RTC law, violent crime rates were
11% to 14% higher than predicted had such laws
not been in place
After controlling for changes
in incarceration rates and the number of police
per capita, RTC laws were associated with a
10% higher murder rate 10 years following the
adoption of RTC laws
11 This is consistent with
findings from a prior study showing that violent
crime increased with each year an RTC law was
in place 12 and a recent study that found RTC
laws are associated with a 10
6% increase in
homicides committed with handguns
[Source]
You don't like metal lyrics used as a comment
Well, the only reason the Norwegian police normally don't carry guns is that guns in general makes people more jumpy and paranoid
If everyone knows that no one is carrying a gun, then things tend to calm down
So to me it's perfectly logical that gun crime goes up when there are more people carrying guns in general - even if the "legal carriers" are not the ones necessarily doing the shooting
That doesn't change the fact that guns make people nervous
> I just don't believe in policing law abiding citizens on what they're allowed to do
Do you believe you should be allowed to carry a gun in schools, court houses, malls, airports, or while inside and airplane
My current flat in Oslo cost almost exactly that, three years ago
75 sqm, two bedrooms, very central (15-30 min walk to any touristy part of the city center)
Sadly (well, not for me) I think it's gone up in value by quite a lot since then
I'm guessing 100-200k EUR
The housing market here is crazy
That would be enough for a decent sized house (150 sqm+) with 3-4 bedrooms where I live
It's a village in the Norwegian countryside, about an hour away from Oslo
But the same house would be twice as expensive in a more urban area
A 40sqm apartment, decent location
Not amazing locations, but okay I guess
None with a good view though
Biggest I could find was 100sqm, but is sold as a redoing project, so you would have to add a couple ~~100k €~~ in addition if you want that one
Cheapest solo-house I could find(that is not a redoing project), is 770k€, but not a good location
Edit: I was probably being a bit ambitious saying 200k in renovations
When 100k could do the trick
Sorry about that
In my area of Oslo (40' inhabitants), there are two flats on the market right now for four million NOK
One is 72 m2 and the other is 66 m2
Both two bedrooms and well maintained
3 or 4 bedroom house with a large garden and garage, all newly redecorated
In a city it might get you a 2 bedroom apartment, depending on the area
Ålesund, Norway
You could get a hella nice and big house out on the islands, or an okey house on the main island
You will need 200k euros or more for a proper house in Ålesund that doesnt take another 100k to fix up
Just looking online now
Anything from 50 sqm to 89 sqm apartment near the city center
Outside the city you could get some detached homes with more square footage, but they're going to be old
Can you give an example
About the same around here as well, a couple of hours southeast of Oslo
Or a normal sized house with a garage if you go a few kilometres out of city centres
Where are you
You can get a 50-60 sqm in the suburbs of Oslo
Maybe in the Frogner or Grünerløkka area it's gonna be the prices you describe
What area (if you're comfortable saying, bydel/borough is enough)
I bought a 2br flat that's a bit more than 72 sqm for exactly four million ~3 years ago at "Nedre Kampen" (ie
Tøyen but on the Kampen side of Ring 2)
I think mine is worth a bit more now though
I’m not in Oslo, but close
I don’t want to say exactly where, but west of Oslo
Yeah that's incorrect of them
You could renovate an 80 sqm apt for 100K €
Bydel Østensjø
Should have been southwest, maybe
I miss going to Sweden, pescy covid regulations
Bergen is probably the biggest tourist destination in Norway, and [Fisketorget] should be on top of the list of tourist traps
It is marketed as an 800 year old market for fresh seafood, but in reality it consists of tents placed in a prime location
The sea food isn't really fresh, and anything is insanely overpriced
You can buy a seafood platter for €60, served in a tent on paper plates with plastic utensils
Twice the price in a decent restaurant
You can buy a can of sardines for €6 euro, 6 times the price of the supermarket
And of course, the ever present souveniers
All staff is multilingual, and no locals shop there
>In Copenhagen I would say Nyhavn
It isn't that much more expensive than other centrally located places in Copenhagen
Is it
It is what you expect
If you sit down somewhere in prime location prices tend to be high anywhere
It isn't really a tourist trap, just an expensive area
A tourist trap is something of low value that is explicitly marketed towards tourists and sold at inflated prices
The most expensive bottle of water I ever bought was in Venice
Supermarkets or one of the few specialty fish mongers
There's one right by the Fish market There's also a possibility to shop directly from a farmers market a couple of times a week, and there's also a fish truck
In other words, there's a lot of possibilities outside the fish market
I loved Rome, but Venice not so much
But I think I would like to visit some of the smaller towns in Italy next time I visit
Something to look forward to while we are all stuck in our own countries
> Parma
That is a city
I thought it was only a ham
haha
They should have called it parmAsan
Ah ok
It's my husband's favourite cheese

Octopus can be translated to ink squirt
Not sure if it counts, but the norwegian colloquialism for a ushanka hat is bjørnefitte, or bear pussy in english
> “Jellyfish” in Irish is “smugairle róin”, which means “seal snot”.
In my dialect of Norwegian, they are called "kobbspy". "Kobbe" is the common seal or harbour seal, and "spy" means vomit (spew)
So seal vomit
Same in Norwegian: Løvetann
We use *Hestehov* (Horse hoof) for Tussilago farfara and *Løvetann* is for Taraxacum officinale

The squirrel was impressed by your algebra
In Norway, the floor at street level is always called the first floor
The one above is the second floor etc
We don't have another word for ground floor, but some basements (especially in larger buildings) can be called "underetasje" (under-storey)
Ground level is 1st floor
Anything else gets really confusing
> there might be some odd exceptions
Yup
We start counting at 1
Not at 0
Oh yeah, that's an interesting theory
I've never thought about it before, but yeah we do have a lot of houses like that where the house has "ground floor" entrances in both the (half-)basement and the first floor
Maybe the countries who call it "ground floor" generally don't have those types of houses
The paper clip, the spraybox, the H-window, fertilizers and of course, the cheese slicer
- Gas turbine
- Slalom
- telemark
- ski jumping
- Spray cans
- Fertilizer
The cheese cutter
Don’t know if it’s famous in other parts of the world but the cheese slicer
It’s REALLY popular here in Norway
If you don’t have a cheese slicer in your home, it’s not a Norwegian household
SAS would disagree
The paperclip isn't actually Norwegian though
And Git
You working for SAS or what
Have you seen how impressive the other countries lists are
Just claim the invention for Norway and shhh
We have the counties Vestland=West land, Nordland=North land and Innlandet=Inland
Vestland and Innlandet are even brand new, so yeah, not very innovative
Every place name in Iceland is bland when you speak the language
> Australia is known for having very bland names for slot of places
Prime example would be most of our states and territories: Western Australia, South Australia, Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory
The only "interesting" names would be Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania
And how can I forget, the only place in Australia where snow can be found year round: The Snowy Mountains
Aren't there any places in Australia that kept their native names
We have a town called Mo i Rana
There's a commune named Rana
Mo means like, a plain
The name translates to: Plain in Rana
It would be as if my dads name was man with cap
Also, there seems to be towns called Ausfahrt every 5 km
Maybe Copenhagen/København
"Trading port"
The funny thing is, Nordland isn't even the northern most county, there are two more counties north of it
And all of the most common town and village names in Norway are geographical: Stormyra (the big wetland), Haugen (the hill), Åsen (another way to say the hill), Moen (the plain), Holmen (the island), Bakken (yet another way to say the hill),  Neset (the peninsula), Dalen (the valley)
[Here's an article that lists the 20 most common, in Norwegian
It had wine in abundance
Delicious wine
They also have a place called Bøgballe
Nordland used to, historically, cover what is now Nordland county, as well as 3/4 of today's Troms county
Finnmark was called something else before, and either way the borders up north between Russia and Norway was rather free flowing since it was in practice only the sami people who lived there
Not exactly, I think it is like one of your "län". We merged a few recently, thereby the new names
Small ball here
Yesh
> Vërinordland and Vêrivërinordland
Made me laugh
Thank you
Troms and Finnmark
Also Svalbard, although that's not really considered as a county
Not living in the EU but the EEA, i hope that my dear country doesn't have to follow the stupid article 13 rules
This wouldn't happen if all the nerds stopped pirating stuff
Glad we're not in the eu, yet at least
Why should we allow that
Because I don't want a situation where bands, movie makers etc
stop making stuff because they can't get paid (enough) from selling their stuff
Fewer than they would have without piracy, m8
I would say it's common to use garlic/sour cream dressing or BBQ sauce or something on the pizza
One of the big pizzachains sell those as extras
I personally dont use anything else
Oh yeah, Iceland is like the king of unnecessary, disappointing, heavy "sauces". It's all mostly processed, mayonnaise-like base with a loose hint of some kind of flavour that the name suggests
We have something called *hamborgarasósa*, which is this sticky, heavy, grossly sweet pink sauce people put on hamburgers
And then there's the *grænmetissósa*, "vegetable sauce", which just tastes vague
That's the only way to describe it
There are all kinds of varieties and they're all just as blah
But people put it on everything and dip everything in it
It's abundant
Can't forget Bearnaise, especially in Trøndelag
Everyone seems to use it here
Pros: high standard of living, equality, clean air and water, good and almost free healthcare, political stability, freedom of speech and general freedom to be who you are, pretty good and reliable public transport in central parts (especially in and around Oslo), almost free education, safety, gorgeous landscapes and vast wilderness open to all to use
Cons: 99% rural, little going on, expensive, not much cultural possibilities outside of the biggest “cities”, places without much career possibilities for people with higher education or to people at all, scarce variety in shops, general lack of possibilities outside of the “cities”, lack of places to socialise, little to none restaurant or bar culture outside of the biggest “cities”, introverted society, hard drinking culture, slow and difficult labour market to some measures, “Janteloven”, very expensive property market leading to many youngsters never having possibility to get their own place to live, not a part of the EU, living on a peninsula together with the Swedes with few ways to go to the rest of Europe except by plane, reliability on cars, economy reliant on oil, little interest in doing anything special (handicrafts, startups, etc
), bureaucracy, slow and difficult healthcare sector, endless planning of upgrades of the infrastructure
Pro: actual seasons
In February (today) you can enjoy the snow and at the same time look forward to the warm sunrays of spring
In spring you can enjoy the green freshness all the while looking forward to the summer heat and the first trip to the lake or beach
In summer you can enjoy the lazy sun and also look forward to fall when everything settles down
In the fall you can enjoy the crispness and the colours while you wait anticipating the first snowfall
Having something to look forward to is underrated
It just helps people look ahead in their lives, really
Everyone has activities they love for each of the four seasons
It is a reminder that everything will pass, and everything will be born again
Con: small-minded self absorbedness
Being the top rated country in almost every category makes people arrogant and egosentric
Every damn day top news stories are «some foreign celebrity thinks Norway is beautiful» or «one Norwegian talent is popular in USA» or something like that
It’s embarrasing
> 99% rural
Do you know what rural means
Which of the two
We have the term "Klok kone" (wise woman), although not used exclusively for this meaning
In general it means a woman knowledgeable in the field of old "medicine" like herbs, ointments etc
but in the context of a young girl "in trouble," the person who performs abortions would most often be referred to as a "klok kone"
Yes, I was also going to say *klok kone* if someone else didn't say it first
They were called "englemakersker" here too
Only "patriotic" if you listen to the refrain and nothing else

Both Israel and Australia are European as they participate in the most Europeanist cultural event of all times: The Eurovision Song Contest
Morocco auditioned once, but was deemed un-european in contrast to the two other, European countries
> But- When faced with the above choice, most Israelis would say the feel more European than Asian
Even though we're not even partially in Europe, funnily enough
You participate in the Eurovision Song Contest
If that doesn't make you partly European I don't know what will
Yup, people often think of East Asia when you say "Asia". Who's the most famous Asian of all time
Few would immediately realize that the correct answer is "Jesus".
Brown cheese
I'm just kidding, we eat brown cheese all the time
[Lutefisk] Americans of Norwegian decent think this is the most Norwegian dish of all, but it is very unusual in Norway
A few people eat it once per year as a Christmas tradition, but most people would never even have tasted it (and for good reason if you ask me)
Call me crazy but I’m pretty sure I saw multiple natives eat Churros in the morning in Madrid
I agree
Or even reindeer with fried onions and mushrooms, with roasted potatoes, lingonberry jam and a light brown cream sauce (fløtesaus), delicious
I so miss the taste of just some salted reindeer meat snack
But like you said, expensive
Love finnish reindeer salami
Ah, "turtleneck"! Great to eat when you're a cold Prague winter tourist
That's like saying Christmas beer isn't common because more liters of lager is consumed
Honestly lutefisk consumption is through the roof if it's 10% of frozen pizza, when frozen pizza is available year round
Can also add Smalahove to this list, boiled sheep's head
Mostly eaten by tourists as a challenge
I haven't even seen lutefisk being served
It's pretty much non-existent where I grew up and where I live
Same here
I'm 27 and still never eaten or seen it served irl
I have some friends that eat it with family but that's about it
My parents eat it occasionally, but I don't see the point
It either tastes horribly or nothing at all
I just ate the bacon and potatoes
My dad had a pin he got on a "lutefiskbord" that said "lutefiskelskere elsk i kveld" (lutefishlovers (make) love tonight) and I thought it was the most disgusting sentence I had ever heard
In the north they have it year round, tried it first this summer
Smakte som tørrfisk hentet tilbake fra døden
Tørrfisk Men ikke fra døden
Har aldri hørt om at det spises året rundt
Føler meg lite norsk her
Vet ikke om de gjør det overalt, men i den lille fiske landsbyen gjor de det
Many superstitions are very international, like umbrellas indoor and walking under ladders and cracking a mirror
In Norway, and perhaps Scandinavia but still, it’s been an old belief that it’s Thor with the hammer that creates thunder
We also have this thing about trolls; often if you find a strange, stray Boulder, it from the old days was believed to be trolls who had been fighting by throwing rocks at each other
To scare children from walking alone down to the water, a story about Nøkken was made; a water creature that takes form of a white horse (amongst others) to lure you into the water
I remember one thing from school that hasn´t been mentioned yet
If you wear a necklace and the lock has moved and is showing in front a boy is thinking of you
If it was on the right hand side a dark haired boy and on the left it was a light haired boy
If someone found a hair on your clothes they should pick it up and measure it with their fingertips, and «count» with the alphabet to find out the first letter of the name of the boy that will marry you
If you pick a daisy you can think of a boy/girl and pluck the petals off and say «Loves, loves not» to find out if this person is in love with you
In Norway *Nøkken* is a creature that lives in bogs/rivers and will drag you into the water and drown you if you get too close
Basicly a way to scare children into not playing near bodies of water and in swamps
I like this one because it has a purpose
Also *Nisse* \- Small mischevious creatures, not goblins, not trolls, but a *Nisse -* often portrayed as a small male figure with a beard and a woolen pointy hat, kinda dressed as a farmhand: [here is an image] They are based on *vetter -* smaller demigods/creatures from the otherworld that look after the farms of humans on earth and have had several different names in different regions
They come with different roles, there is the *fjøsnisse* who resides in the barn, they are kinda chaotic lawfull, as they expect certain traditions to be held (porridge at christmas to be set out for them) and will do mischevious things if you don't uphold the tradition
Give rice porridge at Christmas to the barn midget
If you don't he will kill your animals, or make them sick at the very least
The sign that he is there is that the porridge is gone the next morning
(Because obviously it couldn't have been the cat who ate it
Obviously this is an old and outdated superstition, and I can't actually think of any superstition that still exist today
To add to this
If a child is left in the forest to die without a proper burial, they will turn into a dangerous spirit called Myklar, who will hunt people walking in the woods alone and latch onto their backs
They will ask to be taken to a graveyard, but if the person refuses or is unable to make it there, the Myklar will snap their neck
On christmas eve, you have to shoot at the sky to ward off evil spirits
(These next ones aren't very common and are very old, but they're cool)
On christmas eve, if you walk backwards around your house 3 times with a beer, then put the beer in your shoes, the next person to pick up/drink from that cup will be the person you marry
If you dress a chair in clothing for the opposite gender (these traditions are very old) and put a beer on it, then stare at it without thinking, you will marry the next person who drinks the beer
We have the cake thing too, is that not universal
I always assumed it was something everyone did, but now I’m kinda hoping it’s just a Scandinavian thing
This is what I learned as well
Hmm I remember the math notebook was green, then a small blue one for grammar, then the was kinda pinkish-redish-somethingish for everything else
I have kids in schools and they hardly use any folders at all
(Do school kids in other countries get lots of loose papers they need to put in folders
Being in Europe but not in the EU it is extremely confusing and frustrating dealing with ordering things online as you are never certain if you are to select the "Europe" option with the EU flag, or ROW
More often than not you are even redirected to the EU page, but the items won't ship outside the union, so a lot of goods simply cannot be bought by any private person
The sun sets at 15:00 in the winter, it's cold all the time and it's expensive
As for Northern Norway, I can't remember last time I saw the sun but I believe it's more than a month ago
The sun gets up 10:33 today, and goes away 13:11 again where i live
dark times are ahead
The sun set a few days ago here
Gonna see it again in January though
Preach, brother
Amen to this
The sun won't rise again until january here, the midnight sun in the summer is really nice though
Same
It's fairly common here to hear about Dutch people buying up remote little farms in Norway
I always thought it was due to population density
Never thought it might be due to lack of nature
Due to drinking
Or do Scots do it while sober
> or cat whistled
What happened to all the French gentlemen
This is different here
We have friends who are wealthy business people
Another friend is a poor single mum who is on social security
Our family are somewhere in the middle
We honestly couldn't care less
If this is our worst problem then we have it pretty good
This is why some Eurovision shows or something similar also have a French commentator
Makes sense
Says the German
Really
I thought that was Denmark
Here it won't rise above the horizon until the middle of January
There's still twilight for a few hours in the middle of the day, though
Where I live (Trondheim), it's pretty bright all night in the middle of summer
The sun sets at around 23:30 and rises at around 03:00 at the brightest
Of course, north of the arctic circle the sun doesn't set at all
I think so too
Sure summer is nice with daylight 24/7 but I really enjoy the cozy darkness of the winter
Nothing better than sitting inside by a fireplace sipping on a stout and enjoying the winter wonderland outside
Not open on sundays here at least
No stores, except some tiny food markets, are open on Sundays
It's a "resting day" :)
Eh, sovereignity, self-sufficiency, oil, and stuff
Tromsø! 69
69° ^^nice North
There are seasons
You got lots of nature too
In several parts of Norway the sea level is actually sinking
So this should be the safe place to be
> Social class isn’t entirely about wealth here, more just whatever class you were raised around
> You can be upper class and poor
Same as Wayne Rooney will always be working class despite being wealthy
So I hear
Still a somewhat unknown concept here
What would you say is the difference between being upper class and poor, and lets say middle class and well-educated with a healthy income
You can get a higher rate paying job to offset the cost of pizza
But you can't force your brain to release serotonin
Lutfiske is decidedly better than perpetual night
lol it doesnt seem like a joke to me
It seems like common sense, but eh as long as the boomers remain in control of politics, it won't happen
Hmm
I think we have more of a 9/1/1/1 (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall) month spread of season up here
So loosing upper class'ism takes one generation
How many generations would it take to become upper class
But if someone became super wealthy, and their children go to posh schools and hang out with other posh children
Would the children be considered upper class
If not, would their (still wealthy) grand children be considered upper class
> Worth noting that I am not in this social class so not sure how they react to newcomers who aren’t in the public eye (probably a mixed bag like the rest of us)
I sort of picture all upper class people to see something like Reddit at totally beneath them
In Norway I'd have to say Tromsø. Beautiful city and the people are lovely ️
Lofoten and Vesterålen maybe for region
I'd say it looks like but I'd rank it below Kristiansand still
Tbh, temperatures can lie a lot
a lot
-20 degrees in the middle of nowhere (such as Kautokeino/Karasjok, inner Finnmark) doesnt actually feel that cold at all
However, if you add that temperature to a coastal city or a place where "wet" air is regular it will be much much colder
When i was in the army i was stationed in inner Troms county, temps regularly went below -15 and -20, the coldest was -30
That said, in my home town, -10 with the usual wind we have and moist weather since we are coastal city is fucking cold, a lot colder than the dry air in -20/-30 range
Heck, you can actually go outside in a t-shirt in -20 dry weather and not be that bothered by it
It's around -20 in my city now(Trondheim) and I wouldn't say things are too different to what they are normally
Main thing is just you spend a lot more time indoors, no going out chilling in the park for a couple hours
I took a walk today in -18 or so and I try to get some exercise in(running or cross country skiing) a couple times per week
But other than that I stay inside
Society here is just designed around knowing it gets cold, and there are solutions in place to make sure it goes smoothly
You have snowplow veichles out early every morning if it has snowed out clearing the roads, sidewalks are applied gravel for extra grip if its slippery, food delivery has been done by car the couple times I've ordered recently etc, it's not seen as a huge hassle here when it's cold, it's just a season like the others and the cold weather eventually goes away
As far as clothing go I personally don't overdo it, I'm quite comfortable with the cold and I dont mind my face freezing in -20 for 10 min whilst I wait on the bus
It's a bit refreshing actually
I don't really wear any inside layers, just jeans as normal, sneakers but I get my winter jacket out when it dips below -5
I just bought a beanie and some leather gloves this winter actually
Before I just used my hoodie or put my hands in my pockets if cold hehe
I also grew up in an even colder city in the inland where it used to go down to -30 and I would say there the worst part was when u waited for 10-15 min for the bus and it didn't arrive lol
I you live in an area that might have very cold winters or some weeks with very cold weather, you have - at least I do - a really warm outer layer of clothing
I have a wool winter coat I can only use when it is really cold, if not I start sweating
And I have pair of winter boots
If you are going to be outside for a longer period of time, you can wear an inner layer of wool, like wool tights and long sleeved wool shirt under your regular shirt and pants
But in big cities you are usually not outside for that long, you are walking somewhere, you go into a store or the subway or a bus and walk some more
If you are in the cold for no longer than 30 minutes every time you are exposed to the cold, you can wear sneaker and jeans as long as you have a warm coat
Because in a city, you can always go inside somewhere and warm up
Diesels - especially older cars - do struggle to start in the cold and if you have an older car with a weak battery, the cold will kill your battery
But basically, if you live in a very cold area, everything in society is prepared for cold temperatures so most things work and life goes on as normal
Because what didn't work because of the cold was fixed the previous time it was really cold and it broke
Everything adapts to the environment, so cold weather is worse in areas where people are not prepared for cold weather
Thanks god it doesn't get very cold where I live
I get frostbite quite easily
I live on the western coast of Norway
It's usually arounc 0C in the winter, but we tend to get a couple of weeks that's way colder
The last 14 days have been between -10 and -15C , and today is a frisky -17C
There's a few things that we do to keep us warm
The first thing is wool
We use wool all over
I have a woolen sweather, woolen socks, wool soles in my boots as well as wool cap, scarf and mittens
My overcoat is wool, and if I plan to walk for more than 20 minutes I wear wool thermals beneath my pants
It's really no big deal, it's just part of my wardrobe
The second thing is that we keep moving
You'll see a lot of people walking, but very few are just hanging around
It's too cold to stay outdoors if you don't remain active
Handling cold isn't really that difficult
There's a few posters telling that they wear T-shirts in -20C, and that is probably true if you only plan to stay outside for a couple of minutes
Stay for longer, and you'll catch a seroius cold and possibly hyopthermia
You cannot train your body to handle cold, but you can adapt to the feeling of being cold
When a person starts to feel the cold the usual reaction is to get anxious
Feeling cold and freezing is uncomfortable
The trick is to learn how to ignore those signals while at same time dressing properly
You don't need to cover yourself in a snow suit to stay warm, but you need to thoroughly cover those part of your body that represents the greatest heat loss
Such as your head, your neck, your wrists and your ankles
Your torso, your arms and your legs needs covering too, but not necessarily too thick (then you'll break a sweat and start to freeze)
Freezing at fingers and toes are really uncomfortable too, so you need proper shoes, socks and mittens
Other than that, it's business as usual
You quickly learn how to use your nose to answer your phone instead of removing gloves or mittens
I have special gloves, one pair is thin, and has a special fiber (or whatever) that makes it possible to use touch-screen
My other pair is more for photography
, [Markhof Pro 2
0 gloves]
Actually, it rarely gets colder than -10
I believe it's also the northernmost city that has a yearly average temperature above zero
English
The exceptions would be if there is a domain-specific phrase it would only create confusion to translate, or if I'm writing a temporary comment to myself
English
But I have heard that some government projects require the code to be written in Norwegian
I have no experience with that though
Lidl only lasted 4 years in Norway
They where a joke here
When it was here it was probably considered the worst one
Both in the selection they sold, and how they treated their workers
That being said, I miss it
Certain things you could not buy anywhere else
I liked the shop
However it didn't survive the Norwegian market and they sold all their venues to Rema 1000
I go there when I'm in Germany though
And they had to abandon their initial store concept (without any local products) for the last two or so of those years
I went there exactly once, didn't see *any* recognizable products
Never went back
Yeah, people want familiarity and everything that is different or new, that's something bad
That goes for people as well
Not as much in the bigger cities cause there's so much variety of culture there, but across the land it is
However I love new things
I seek out stores that aren't of the most popular
I miss Lidl
Really
I just stayed in Poland for 6 months and mostly shopped at our local Lidl
There were constantly long queues and ultra slow cashiers, and really limited choices
Not that Biedronka is any better, I prefer Kaufland or Carrefour
That's why they didn't survive, the change came too late and by then they were dead
I found the store disorganized and the stuff they were selling their looked "shady" at best
The store smelled awful as well
A few years ago my best friend at work was a man
But we did not hang out outside work since we both were married
(If we would have done that we would obviously have brought our spouses along)
Before I married I had another male friend, and we went out for coffee, and the cinema being just friends
So yes - its completely normal, although sometimes you end up dating the person, or things will change quite a bit if you get another girlfriend/boyfriend
And having groups of friends where there is a mix of genders is also very common - and I would say - quite healthy
My son is in primary school, and the teacher has made an effort to make sure both girls and boys in the class are friends with each other
This to help make a good class environment
> Boys and girls meaning kids
Rarely I'd say
My sons best friend in kindergarden was a girl
They played together everyday from the age of 2-7
At 7 sadly some of the other boys teased him about it and he started to play more with the other boys
Really
I wonder why its different in Finland compared to the rest of the Nordic
Makes sense
I just say "hei" (hi)
The exception is when I've been job searching, then I'll answer with "hi, this is (name)", in case it's anyone from a job I've applied to
I just say "Hallo
" (not really a question, but with the upwards intonation)
“Ja, hallo” — “Yea, hello”
My grandma used to answer with “ja, værsågod” — “yes, please”
It’s also very common to answer with your last name or first name
I make and receive actual voice calls so infrequently that I'm genuinely thrown off when I get a call
If it's a number I recognize and I see a call from it, I'll answer and ask if everything's okay - otherwise why are you calling and not texting
If it's a number I don't know, I'll say "hello
" in a probably bewildered tone, and ask if it's really me they're looking for (and not Lionel Richie, like the song goes)
thats so strange that a lot of you just say hi - I always state my name, and so does most my friends and family members
Like "Hi you're talking to Lily whassap"
Pronto, Legrerg
Same
Even when it's a unknown number
Me and my husband always answer each other calls with "Nei, er det den karen
" (Is it that guy/man) lol
Usually we say it was unified under Harald Hårfagre around 880AD
But there were still some smaller kings around and the borders were different than they are now
But I think that is what would be the answer on a elementary school quiz if you catch my drift :)
According to the sagas, Norway was unified under Harald Fairhair ca
880
three dates come to mind
around year 1000 several small tribes and cheifdoms are united into the kingdom of norway
1814, we gain our independence from denmark after having been in a personal union with them for centuries, effectively being a part of denmark
this is also where we get our constitution
1905, we get our own king, seperate from the king of sweden, with which we had been under a personal union with, but with much more self control due to the constitution
personally i would say around year 1000 is when norway comes into being, but 1814 is when norway reaches it’s modern form
872 AD
The interesting part is that our founder "King Harald Fairhair" might just be a myth
Well, the first Norway was unified in 872, but then Kalmar happened and we eventually got a constitution and broke free from Denmark in 1814
only to be stuck in a union with Sweden until 1905
Your pick
But it was its own country before the brits occupied it in the 1700s no
You could also argue that it was in 1814, when the Danish "occupation" ended, we got partial sovereignty, and our own (and current) Constitution
Some would even say 1905, which is when the current political entity of Norway gained full independence from the Swedes
We just don't know if Harald Hårfagre ever existed, he's a bit like our Jesus
> around year 1000 several small tribes and cheifdoms are united into the kingdom of norway
880AD
Or 1884 when we (gradually) implemented parlamentarism
But yeah, Hårfagre or 1814 is probably the most correct time periods
Nah, lets stick with 880AD
I think I read that we're sure his son existed atleast Eirik Bloodaxe
Aha, didn't know that
Apparently my English isn't that good because I can't remember the English word for it: but my family has one of [these] (edit: trailer) that we use for transporting larger items
I dunno where you live, but our local IKEA here in Norway let's you rent a van for next to nothing for three hours to get your bigger purchases home
I've seen new neighbours abuse that system when they move in (often you need to buy new stuff when you move anyway)
Otherwise some petrol stations here rent them out too
Many stores that sell bulky materials offer free use of a trailer
Some even offer to load the stuff you want onto a trailer, so all you need to do is just drive there, hook it up and pay
The annoying thing is that you have to return it afterwards meaning you need to do an extra run
If a trailer is unsuitable I have access to lots of vans through my car sharing service
The vans is quite big, with a space around 6 m3
The bed is big enough to fit a huge stack of drywall or plywood sheets
Another option is simply to strap it to the roof
Most cars can have a 75-100kg load on the roof
That allows you to strap quite a few 5-6 meter long boards on top if you really need it (Personally I hate driving with something on my roof)
If the things you order are to heavy or to bulky you can always get it delivered
Big deliveries can turn out to be quite a show when the a lorry tries to navigate the corner of your narrow old street you deliberately did not mention when you paid the flat fee for delivery of 4 tons of concrete and three tons of building materials to your lot
Basicly this yeh
I usually have room for what I buy in the back of my stationwagon
I don't currently have a car with a trailer hook, but I've only needed it once in the past five years so I guess I can manage
Same in norway
Haha I actually did do that, but I just felt that "trailer" was the wrong word
That sounds lovely
It rains on average 231 days a year in my city so waiting for a day with no rain can take a while
Its free from ikea here
Ding ding ding, we have a winner
I actually don't know, I don't often see pick up trucks, and I don't know anyone who owns one
yeah I am calling this a lie
If he actually lived in Bergen he would have 134 days more
I used to call my aunt "dadda" as she was baby sitting me a lot when I was young
But I have not heard anyone else using that term
We Norwegians (at least in my fylke/kommune) have "Mat og Helse" (Food and Health) in 6th and 9th grade of school
We had classes, but no
They sucked dick and didn't teach anyone anything
This was more or less a decent way to sum up that entire school
Yeah, I think we did cooking in 6th-8th grade
I was a disaster, but it was great fun (and useful)
Yes, we had "Heimkunnskap" / "Mat & Helse" ("Home knowledge" / "Food & Health") in 6th and 9th grade
We didn't just learn to cook, but also how to deal with cleanliness and how to work in teams
I wouldn't really say that I actually learned anything, but they did spend two years trying to teach me
It was called heimkunnskap here too, the ages ago when I went to school
They call it Mat og helse (food and health) now, and it includes learning about nutrition and how it affects your health
I remember cooking classes in 9th grade as well as 5-7th grade
Knowing how to cook is not necessary or important
I strongly disagree
I get the impression that Russia is pretty sexist, and getting worse - [after all, they actually decriminalised some types of domestic violence only a couple of years ago
] I mean - if you have no legal recourse if your husband beats you black and blue, that will definitely make him stop beating you
&#x200B;
It's depressing - I've met quite a few Russians over here (we do, after all, share a border)
They're nice people, they deserve better than that
Haha maybe, I don’t know how old you are, but I’m 21
The year after I starred 8th grade was the year they started up with electives, so even though it isn’t long since I went to school it might be different
Oppose it
I have nothing against immigrants, but I believe they should learn the language if they want to become part of the society
I'm against it
I believe in tougher immigration
As few as possible, ideally
Next generation is not going to speak Norwegian well
Among people around thirty years old in Norway one third are immigrants
They have started to make children now which is why Oslo is in debt - we need a lot new schools and so on
I just bought a book about idioms by Per Egil Hegge, I don't know why I bother since only people above fifty understand them
If I didn't keep contact with a few friends from childhood and some family I would never meet anyone born and brought up here
There was even a problem with water dripping from my upstairs neighbours down to me, and they didn't even know English so I had to tell them in Spanish
Must learn Polish and Thai as well, I think
(But Korean is more fun)
Same with Norwegians
Embarrassing
I'm never going to those places because I hate those kind of "tourists" sitting down in Spain in their colonies, not knowing Spanish or English, collecting welfare and complaining about immigrants in Norway
EDIT: We even have a show called "charterfever" making "fun" of those people, we don't actually make fun of them because they manage that fine by themselves
I think natives should learn the language too and that's why I'm favour of obligatory courses in our national language in schools
However whether natives and immigrants choose to actually to use Norwegian is up to them
Fine by me
I think it would be great if more people started learning Sami, but from what little I have tried to learn it is pretty difficult
I think that is technically allowed, but I am not sure anyone has actually tried to go that route
It's one of the national languages, so it's their right
Although not necessarily in their best interests in the long run
it would not be very usefull in 99% of the country so, no
Edit: I see I need to think a bit before I post a comment, originnaly I wrote something like my response to u/biggestflower
But, I deleted it and put something blunt there that doesnt really reflect my opinon
Not only that, but you'll also lower wages, which is great for corporations but not so much for anyone else
Corporations love to exploit cheap foreign labour at the expense of natives
> We even have a show called "charterfever"
Do they still produce that
I haven't really watched TV for years
In what way
Ive noticed its gotten pretty common to mix in English with Norwegian lately
Also theres quite a lot of things there isnt a Norwegian word for, but there is in English
Especially related to technology
I havent really got an opinion on whether or not you need to learn norwegian to get citizenship
What I will say is that if you speak a Sami language it would defenetliy help you with showing an intrest in the country ect
So it is an advantage, just not something that will be very usefull outside of a few municipalities
It's better than exploitation, social dumping, lower wages and a lack of control of immigration
Maybe Danish in itself is ok, but the Danish number system can go and take a hike imho
If only we didn't get our Bibles from you, that might have been different
Lets just say there is a reason we decided that you could keep your number system and your pronunciation for yourself ...
School provided absolutely everything we needed
Base supplies (that we had to replace ourselves if we lost it), high quality paper, canvases, paints of all sorts, pencils, charcoal, literally everything
We were also given free access to the entire Adobe collection, could borrow camera equipment etc
Even though we were given every supply we needed, the art belonged to us, and we were free to do whatever we wanted with it
Some of my art is used as example material today (5 years since I graduated) and thus “belongs” to the school, but I doubt they’d care if I called them tomorrow and asked if I could get it back
Edit; we had to bring our own laptops and ensure they were healthy enough to run Adobe though
When I studied CS source code written as part of research, student tasks, term papers and degrees using any equipment that the University owned was considered the property of the University and should be published under a Creative Commons license
In reality that served to protect the research since no one could patent it and sell it
It makes sense with regard to CS, but not quite within arts
I don't think so, I gotta admit I don't know when, officially, the first day of spring even is
Maybe if we had a tradition like that I'd remember
I guess we don't really have a big need for a dedicated day for skipping school, considering that it feels like every May there is at least 1 day off every week
The only thing I know of with a similar premise is "Sun days", which we have in the north
When sunshine touches the school for the first time that year we get the day off
It's 1st of March
March, April and May are the spring months
In Norway the first day of spring is the first day when the average temperature is above 0, but below 10, and the trend is rising
And this will differ very much from say Stavanger to Alta
Stavanger has spring in February, while Alta will have to wait until April
Username checks out
This differs from place to place
February is spring in Stavanger, while March is still winter in Alta
Please stop with this nonsense
Education first, then homophobia
It's not nonsense
It's the meteorological seasons
But I agree that in our long country, it doesn't necessarily feel that way
After all, the meteorological seasons are just a made up definition
However, this definition is used by e. g. DNT
No, meteorological spring _in Norway_ starts when the temperature is above 0 and below 10, and the trend is rising:
It seems like we are both right
According to this source:
I en del sammenhenger, f.eks i klimatologiske oversikter som gjelder hele landet, bruker en gjerne årstider på tre måneder hver:
Vinter = desember, januar, februar
Vår = mars, april, mai
Sommer = juni, juli, august
Høst = september, oktober, november
Which is the same as the meteorological season in the English Wikipedia I quoted earlier
Although this is if you generalise for the whole country
If one were to look at when spring starts locally, one would use your definition
En meteorologisk (klimatologisk) definisjon på de fire årstidene i Norge baserer seg på normal døgnmiddeltemperatur
Årstidenes lengde er dermed ulik rundt om i landet
Den delen av året da døgnmiddeltemperaturen er over 10 ° C, er sommeren
Når den er under 0 ° C, er det vinter
Så er vår og høst mellom de to
Thank you for teaching me this
TIL
Yes
No worries
I know we humans like to generalize and standardize, but it simply does not work with seasons, and the 4 x "three month season" way of thinking really doesn't fit
Sorry for being a surpomp earlier on
Haha  no worries, I am a surpomp quite often as well
And I totally agree
4xseasons doesn't quite work
Where I'm from it can easily be 9 degrees and rain on 24th of December and 24th of July
You wouldn't know the difference except for the amount of daylight
Haha, yes exactly
You're from the north too, ey
Yes, I am :) my flair is supposed to say Norway, but ai got a bit confused now since you had to ask
I'm originally from Rogaland, but am currently living in Oslo
Depends on the neighbourhood and where geographically it is
Sometimes we don't get along with neighbours, because of how they behave
But sometimes we get our colleague's from work to live near us :)
No, I live in a town with 1100 people and I barely know anyone
That depends where you live
I grew up in a small village where everybody knows everybody
Visiting your neighbors is normal, and popping by unannounced is common
In the city however it's not common
In my apartment/house block of 12 people, there is lots of drama and competition
I keep out of it
> Can't speak for anywhere else though, I've lived in the same neighborhood all my life
I think that is the key
I grew up in a village where people have lived for generations
Half are related to each other and the rest you have known all your life
"To the guy in 4b. We all think your new gf and your old gf that keeps showing up are totally bangable, but could you please bang them a bit quieter
Love, your neighbors
Hejdå"
20 mins by car on a good day (+ kindergarden delivery)
My girlfriend however does 10 min walk and 7 mins by high speed boat which is kind of nice
The past two years it's been 3 seconds
Before that, in the winter either 1 min walk, 20 min bus, 5 min walk or 5 min walk, 10 min train, 10 min walk
In the spring/summer/fall, 30 min bike
30 minutes by train
Bus for 10 minutes, then a 20 minute subway ride
I like it
fifteen minute walk to uni
We're often outside at my [school] so it's usually a 15-20 min walk to the [gondola] and then a 5-10 min ride up to the mountain
I like the classic greek names, Anaximander, Aristophanes, Hippolyta, Eratosthenes, etc
They sound like gods, or ancient alien robot overlords or something
Arne means eagle btw
Jógvan (Faroese) is pretty cool to me
But it's common as muck apparently
This made me laugh more than it had any right to
This has changed over the years, when I was a kid the standard was to move out at 18, some went to school far away at 16 and just never moved back in because they ended up renting their own place or shared with someone
And some did more education and lived at home in between, maybe left at 25 the latest
Now it's becoming more and more common for people to stay at home up until their 30s, getting work and a reasonable place to rent is becoming more difficult
I feel that the average is getting higher and higher
It much depends on where you are, how lucky you’ve been getting a job and been able to save up, eventually how much your parents can support you getting your own home
Some are lucky with parents owning flats or/and have saved up for their kids to get out, many aren’t. Housing prices are ridiculous many places, especially in and around Oslo
Combined with a cooler labour market and youngsters aiming for high and long university degrees
In addition our government has taken measures to cool down the loan market and the housing market by setting bars for how much you can lend compared with your annual salary and savings
This has made it even harder for young people to get on the inside of the housing market, even giving property investors and rich people better conditions to invest in flats
It’s a given that people stay longer at home in general
It used to be normal to move out at 18-21, but today it’s more likely to be 25-30
I moved out shortly after turning 19, because I went to college in a town that was a little bit away and the commute was absolute shit
19 is fairly common, it's when people are finished with high school and start going to university, alternatively the military
I worked for a few years while living at home after high school though, so I didn't move out until I was 21
The average age to move away from home is [19 years old] and has not really changed much since 1950
Depends a lot on where u live
In the city, some even stay while studying and only move once they're done with that and found a job
In the countryside, some move when they start high school to not have an hour or more commute each way
I'm surprised by UK, but I guess many live at home until they are done with their studies
I moved out when I was 22 :) Right after high school
In 2018 I bought an apartment when I was 26 :) Thanks for the chart, quite interesting to see the differencees
>  and guys stay with their parents and bring their wife home
How interesting
I would think it would be the other way around - the women bringing their husband home (so that the daugther can take care of her parents when they grow old
MY second thought: people must live in very large houses
> This has changed over the years
It actually hasn't. The age of moving out has stayed almost the same since 1950
[Source]
Source for your last claim
Might be true, but that is not my impression at all
> I feel that the average is getting higher and higher
It's actually not
the age of moving out has not changed much since 1950
[Source]
I assume she didn't stay with him
If my husband kicked my child out that would definitely be a deal breaker
I'm sorry you had to go through that
> but I couldn't possibly live with my mother-in-law
I know
And she is even really nice
Not even sure if I would want to share house with my own mother
For perspective, Im talking early ninties vs 2010's and onward
[Aftenposten: Flere unge bor hjemme]
[NRK: Flere unge over 18 år bor hjemme]
I saw some number further up, can be many reasons why
But we can probably agree on the fact that it’s more difficult for younger people to establish themselves today compared to some decades ago, which again leads to many staying longer with their parents
The further north the earlier they leave home
(Here it's 19)
Up here people move away from home at the same time as in 1950 (at 19 years old on average)
But my parents build their house in the 70's before they turned 25
That is uncommon today
Couples usually buy a smaller apartment first, and then buy a larger house later on
In Oslo that’s pretty much impossible if your parents don’t own some flats already or have saved up money for you
Combined with a tough labour market, high rents and so on, it’s a given that the situation is like it is
It is only becoming worse since we do not put any real measures against it, only improving the possibilities for property investors to do their business
In Norway 77% of people own their home
In Oslo the number is 75%. So less of a difference than you might think
[Source]
But you have to agree that things have and are changing over the last decades, all factors considered, especially in the capital
*"I Oslo var vel 70 prosent eiere i 2001, sammenlignet med 76 prosent i 1990
"* [Source]
So it's better now compared to 2001
The difference is that among the poorest in Oslo fewer own their home
[Source] Which obviously is not good
Poor people in Oslo also need a secure living situation
I don’t know if this takes into account the many who owns a flat but then rent out rooms to others, while living in it themselves (or not)
Which is in my experience a more common way to live in Oslo now than before
You are right: *"I Oslo har vi de siste årene sett en nedgang i andelen som bor alene, spesielt i de indre bydelene
Dette er muligens drevet av de økende boligprisene og at noen av den grunn velger å bo sammen med andre for å redusere boutgiftene
Men fremdeles bor det bare én person i over halvparten av boligene i disse bydelene
"* [Source]
Okay
It’s anyway, as another Norwegian commented in this thread, a shift and generally more difficult in to get into the market, everything combined, as this source of yours also is a proof of
I don’t think we discuss or think of this seriously enough in Norway
I’m myself in this situation, 28, living outside of Oslo, with my parents, high degree, been difficult to get any job after the studies and thus also difficult to move out
I’ve several friends at same age in more or less same situation
Seems like the ones in power and the society in general, people who grew up when things were easier and have been used to a good, traditional lifestyle, don’t understand these problems and don’t think much about the future
They think everything will be like it used to be forever, that everything is just as easy for us as it was for them decades ago
Pretty frustrating
Norway tried to trade away a significantly portion of our oil fields for a 40% share of Volvo in 1978
However the shareholders of Volvo eventually rejected the negotiated deal, so nothing come out of it
I’m not sure if it has happened any other places, but during WWII a fascist named Vidkun Quisling tried to coup the nation using radio
Their largest city is called Johannesburg
Even though Johannes is used in Estonia, it is not a "Estonian name". It's a biblical name, common all over
Black metal
For some reason it's become the stereotype on the internet that all norwegians listen to black metal
Sure there are some bands here, but I know very few people who actually are black metal fans, or that even listen to it
Polar bears
wtf
The national frites usage goes drastically up during cyclocross/veldrijden season, right
But that’s not a stereotype that’s just straight fax
Put another schnitzel on the barbie, mate
They might be from here, but they don't play here (much)
They play in Germany, and only return to take photos of their new album cover
I wouldn't be the right person to ask, but I'd say anything from Eminem to Calvin Harris
we were freely given away, then we peacefully seceeded
also, gib back greenland and the faroes
Of course you like us, you and Sweden fought over us for like 700 years
You should look into that
mhhhh i’ll have to think about that one
i don’t get the meme, but it’ll be prime realestate once all the ice melts
Will as always catch the last few minutes with that clapping thing while waiting for the ski jumping from Garmisch-Partenkirchen
never heard of it
Not this year, but I have in the past
I know Poles are
Good luck with Stoch
He looked much better in the quali than he did in Oberstdorf
Now Kubacki is suddenly world class anyway
Hoping for Lindvik's first WC victory now <3
We (the land named the way north) claim 2

The first airplane hijacking in Norwegian history ended with no deaths or injuries after the hijacker, who had drunk up all the beer on board the plane, agreed to surrender his weapon, which was an air gun, in exchange for more beer
I mean you were doomed as soon as we formed the parliament when Denmark lost their grasp in 1814
We were never a part of Sweden
A forced union, but a union nevertheless
Weren't you trying to get Hawaii too
There is a collection of laws stemming from the older Gulathing of Norway, these were taken back to Iceland where they were used and legislated in their first Althing
As there is no written sources of these laws one can't be certain it's the exact same ones which were used
However Ari Thorgilsson wrote the  *Íslendingabók* which states that Úlfljótr brought with him the laws which were used in Gulathing, since he resided in norway for a few years, and as said above, those stem from that
Parliament is the legislative assembly of a country, not a building
If the Russian Parliament moved to Vladivostok, it would still be the Russian Parliament
Tea is just water with spice leaves
How could a member of my own family say something so horrible
[lol]
it's probably avaible on heimskringla
Ouch
Can confirm
We drink tea
It's a reference to [this
Nah, you started
I will never forget the disgusted look on my friend's face over breakfast in Germany
He thought he was getting regular apple juice
As in white beans in tomato sauce
Like english breakfast beans
You'll find them in any grocery store in Norway atleast, usually a few different brands too
16 year olds have no clue about politics, I think the voting age should be raised to at least 20
pula means to fuck in norwegian
Same in Norway
We call it matpakke (food package)
I think we have something roughly similar-sounding to it, it has some kind of "40-year-old-marketing-shmuck-thinks-it-sounds-trendy" name
Ah, but it's a tradition on every holiday in Finland
I usually gamble away about 10 euros if I'm sober, potentially more if I'm not
"Tradition of removing shoes in home"
Ahh, I was wondering why the South Africans and Aussies weren't green at first, then I remembered, they don't wear shoes, so removing them would be hard
Noisy
Only ever have it for breakfast, when you also have time to cook eggs and bacon
Which is never haha, i eat while reading mail at work :)
Oh, and all hotel breakfasts have them
And here you would be scorned for keeping them on, even if you were the king
Probably
It's used for those things but only on special occasions
If I were to put up a flag on a normal Tuesday because I was happy I would be a weirdo
If I put it up on my birthday, liberation day or the national day that is normal or even expected
Although some might find it hard to admit, I will agree with you in that Scandinavians do use their flag quite similar to Americans use theirs
You will also see pennon flags all over they place even on ordinary days (although they appears to be more common in the summer half than the winter half of the year)
I don't really have an issue with it though
Yep
It was not an exhaustive list
[Tilslørte bondepiker]
Dronning Maud
(literally: Queen Maud)
This is really local to where I come from
When we gained independence from Sweden in 1905, our first long and queen were Kong Haakon and Dronning Maud
Once when they visited my home town, the local people wanted to do something special for their new queen and decided to make a new dessert
Dronning Maud (the dessert, not the queen) is almost a fromage
It is made of whipped cream and Kogel Mogel (egg and sugar whipped together)
To the mix, you add gelatin and then you lay down layers of the Cream and Kogel Moggel mix with rasped chocolate in between
Finish it of with generous sprinkle of chocolate
Let rest in the fridge for at least 4 hours, ideally over night to let the gelatin stiffen
You can also add a bit of port to the mix if you want to
This dessert is served at all family gatherings in my family and I love to introduce new people to it
It is getting more known in Norway in general, but it is still a bit of a hidden treasure
Here is the recipe in Norwegian if anybody wants to make it themselves:
Definitely [Kvæfjord cake] It's repeatedly been voted for as the worlds best cake (in norway)
[Queen Maud fromage] comes in at a close second for me
Jeg liker kvæfjordkake (verdens beste) bedre da
Queen maud pudding is a fromage BUT it is VERY inportant to never call it a fromage
Ja det også er en høydare, det er helt klart
Yes
I just call it Dronning Maud to avoid the whole issue
Spiseskje (tablespoon)
Måtte Google, men ja
15ml er korrekt
That the vikings did their whole raiding thing because they were "evil" or something like that
In truth it was mostly because of the scandinavian inheritance system in which the oldest son got all of his father's land
The younger brothers were able to settle new land for a good while, but it came to the point where there was no good land left
This made them look outwards for new land to settle and farm
That Sweden annexed us in 1814
That was Carl Johan’s goal, but after a war in 1814 we agreed that Norway and Sweden should share the same kings and have the same foreign policy
We still had our own military and our own Parliament and constitution
We were basically two kingdoms with the same king
Newspapers from back in the 1800s often referred to the union as "the kingdoms of Sweden and Norway", while not separating us entirely from one another
This isn't something anyone outside of Norway gives a shit about, but here goes
On the 17th of May every year, we celebrate our independence day
Or rather, we celebrate our constitution day which I think people mix together
In 1814 Norway gained it's independence from Denmark and as one of the first countries in the world we got our own constitution
It's the second part we're actually supposed celebrate and for good reason
The reason Norway got independent in 1814 was because Denmark was allied with napoleon and as part of the peace treaty were forced to hand Norway over to Sweden
Right after this decision was made, there were a few months where Norway had seceded from Denmark but not yet been annexed by Sweden
A bunch of nerds noticed this and were like "holy shit you guys we're independent we gotta make a constitution ASAP then Sweden can't take us". So they made a constitution and then Sweden came and annexed us anyway a few months later
People will also say that "actually we went into a union with Sweden". Well this union was agreed on after Sweden went to war with Norway and killed a bunch of people who said no
Doesn't sound like a union of equals to me
Vikings were barbarians
Some bandits were barbarians and raided and pillaged
The rest of the 80% of people were traders and farmers
I heard somewhere that Alex simply didn't want to conquer sparta, as opposed to that he was't able to
Also, they didn’t always sail out to raid
Often they traded or were contracted mercenaries
Guns
Norwegian here can confirm we also have juleøl (christmas beer)
We also have christmas mead
We have our own Christmas beers, but the tradition seems to be a direct Danish import
We even celebrate J-Day in the same way, with Tuborg Christmas hats
we have Gløg, which is kinda supposed to be mulled wine which you drink with nuts and raisins in the gløg. we have christmas beer too, but gløg is definetly the most prevelant since even kids can drink it
And [julebrus]
Julebokk
We have lots of different kinds of juleøl. I used to go to tasting parties and we'd rate all the different types and compare our rating to what they had in the various papers
Good fun :-)
No, it's just a basic soda
Julmust is sold in Norway as a julebrus though
Julmust is something rather
special
Where can you get julmust in Norway (besides IKEA)
Tror det varierer litt:
Yes, relatively common
Norwegian building codes dictate that all new houses must have a chimney
This doesnt apply if the main heating in the building uses underfloor water heating OR is built using the norms for energy effective houses
(TEK 17 passive energy housing)
Before this we hade more strict rules following the TEK10 building codes that mandated all newly built houses to have atleast 2 sources of heating where one of them commonly was a wood stove
These rules were relaxed in favor of a ban on using fossilized fuelsources and more energy efficient buildings
Source:  [  (in norwegian)
Pretty common yes, I usually help my father chop wood in the spring, then it dries over the summer and is used mostly in the winter, in the summer only for heating up the sauna
It's not common to use it as *primary* heating outside cabins
It's *very* common to have a fireplace as a little extra
My house has two fireplaces, one of them in my bedroom
NRK's slow TV show where they showed a fireplace burning (8 hours), before that there was a dedicated 4 hour show just on firewood
Also TV2 showed us how to correctly stack the firewood when storing it ([link] not sure if it works outside of Norway)
Pretty much every house has a fireplace, and every cabin has one
As primary heating
I don't think I've ever seen any houses outside cabins or really old buildings use anything but electric ovens/heat pumps or district heating and only use wood ovens as a supplement
> Norwegian building codes dictate that all new houses must have a chimney
I didn't know that
Can't you switch it to heating
Our air-to air heat pump works as an air conditioner if I hit the reverse button
So in winter it gets the heat in, and in summer gets the heat out
(Not that I have ever needed the airconditioning function
Really
That’s what my family, and mostly everyone I know use
Yeah, this confuses me too
My parents live on an old farm, but they have several ovens (hva faen er oljeovn på engelsk
) dotted around the house for heat
The fireplace is just for cozying up the living room
I think they did use to have forests, then the Vikings used most of the wood for heating
>Nuclear can be negative
How
Well, I'm terribly happy we got a lingua franca out of it atleast
Just imagine how impossible the global economy today would have been if not for most of the world speaking english
And without the globalization we have today, there would have been a lot more war going on, since it would still be profitable
You could say it was a necessary evil ;)
Well, I've been thought it's the brits
Just think about this, in 1913, the british empire controlled 23% of the world population
And 24% of the land area in 1920
Even if you discount america, places such as Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, Australia, Canada speak English because of the empire, and many has it as an official language
Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Shizuoka, Fuji, Nagoya,Nagano, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Kobe, Okoyama, Himeji, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Saga(n?), Kumamoto, Kagoshima, Naha, Naruto, Chiba, Saitama, Nikko, Fukushima, Sendai, Niigata, Aomori, Hakodate, Sapporo
I've learned all the prefectures, and I know that some (a lot) of them are also names of cities, but not exactly which ones
\- Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Yokohama, Fukuoka in general
\- Sapporo and Nagano, because of the Winter Olympics
\- Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for the nuclear bombardments
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Nagaoka, Hiroshima, Kawasaki, Obama
I'll try my best, though I don't watch tha much anime so I'm at a disadvantage
Then again, I'm interested in geography so maybe not
I'll try saying what I think when I think about that city
Kyoto (Civ 6 capital for Japan)
Tokyo (Capital)
Nagoya
Fukushima (nuclear disaster)
Hiroshima (Nuked)
Nagasaki (Nuked)
Aomori (Recent Kento Bento vid)
Akita (Recent Kento Bento vid)
Fukuoka (That big city in the south)
Gifu (That other decently sized city I don't know why I know of
Osaka (That giant city that isn't Tokyo)
Sapporo (Biggest city in Hokkaido)
Fuji (Mount Fuji)
Naha (That big city on those islands in the south (Okinawa))
Hiroshima, Fukushima, Nagasaki, Tokyo, Kyoto
Aaaaand thats about it
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Kobe, Sapporo
Sapporo is somewhat known here due to winter sports
They usually host cross country skiing and other skiing disciplines events
Only reason I've heard of it
Pretty much all documentaries i watch are in English, of the recent ones i have seen it's these two who stand out, David Attenborough and Brian Cox
For my own country
i don't know, i really can't say anyone which stands out
I have seen a few of the Attenborough documentaries in Norwegian on our state channel NRK, then the voice has been that of Frode Stang
That said, i had never heard of him until i had to search it up now
He was my first thought when I read this question
He is not informal
He is formal head of ruling party
He is informal leader of Poland itself tho
Wikipedia is partially correct
It starts with the hebrew name of Elisjeba
This became Elisabet in Scandinavia, then shortened to Else in Denmark and Norway, Elsa in Sweden
Now go do nothing useful with this tidbit of knowledge
Yes
We just use toast machines
Usally good non white bread, ham cheese and ketchup, somtimes onion/paprika :)
Called ostesmørbrød (lit
"cheese butter bread") here in Norway
Yes, we just call them toast
Ham and cheese is standard and I use oregano and some other spices on mine
It's what I eat for breakfast most days
I don't use a pan though, but rather a "toastjern", basically a machine to press it together
Money and fish :)
>We are the only EU member to invest billions into saving its national airline's which nobody wants
If you look at attempts at establishing airlines in Italy, almost all fail:
- Alitalia has failed multiple times
- Air Italy was backed by Qatar Airlines and still failed
- Norwegian Air tried to establish a base flying long haul to the US and within Europe and they failed (long before their current problems started)
It seems like it's simply not possible to have a profitable airline in Italy
And we provide a lot of natural gas to several European countries
...And we had a traitor so bad his last name became a noun in English
Also, thank you for Carlsberg and Lego
"Level up", I like that
Unfortunately,  some countries are levelling up into end game bosses
I am looking at you, Victor Orban
Edit: spelling
But Itlay you get 94 million visitors every year
Alitalia / Air Italy should be able to get a couple of those
Many other European countries are good at trains, but also have profitable airlines
My autocorrect bungled "Victor Orban". Fixed it now
No no, not at all
I'm definitely not qualified to say anything about italian trains so I trust what you say :)
Hey Italy
Stop giving Germany ideas again
We drank all our D2O and ate all our iron
Nothing to see here
The oil is fake news
Vidkun Quisling obtained what few others have achieved: His name became synonymous with [traitor]
Quisling is our most well-known traitor, while the most insidious, cruel and harmful one was probably Henry Rinnan
His people, the "Rinnan Band", infiltrated the Norwegian resistance as well as recruiting to several false "resistance" movements
They also made secret arrests and engaged in torture of civilians and resistance fighters
He was executed by firing squad at the end of the war
The lieutenant in charge finished him off with two shots to the head at close range - ostensibly as a coup de grace, possibly for the pleasure of killing the little motherfucker himself
There was a saying "there are 10 uslings in 1 Quisling". Usling is an "ussel" person, a person with bad thoughts and actions
I didn't know people knew him outside of Norway
Because of the needs of the german war industry, the use of metals like copper and nickel were rationed
Therefore the nazi government printed one and two kroner on paper instead of coins
Lesser change was made of iron and zinc
The people nicknamed the two kroner bill a "quisling" and the one kroner was called a "usling" hence the expression there are two uslings in one quisling
Me neither
Rather surprising
Thanks for clearing that up
Norway, having social benefits on the more generous part of the scale compared to other countries, invest a lot of time and money in making sure that this is not abused
For example by making sure that receivers of said benefits does not just take the money to Poland, Spain or whatever, but that you are supposed to be close to where you live so that you can receive the necessary help to get you off those benefits (medical treatment, job search help ++)
They, as in the state, are not shy of prosecuting you if they believe you do not follow these rules
Well, it turns out that the EEA rules regarding free flow of goods, services etc
, across borders also covers benefits received from the state, after a change in 2012
The result
Of course, people have been prosecuted and even jailed (36 cases of the latter this far discovered), when they were within their rights to do so
Massive shitshow
And the best thing: every proof points out that they knew about it, NAV, the government, ministers, everyone
The EFTA court even had a comment years ago about it and questions were raised, but dismissed in “the system”. I can’t believe our courts didn’t look into it, but took it as given, maybe the price of having general competent courts with tight budgets
It is so clear when you see it against the EEA/EU principles
It had been discussed in the parliament back in 2012
It was said to be very complicated, until a lawyer looked at it, then it wasn’t. It’s just another field where Norway don’t want to obey to our international obligations, we think we know best, we think we do best, always
The denying nowadays, that they didn’t knew, that they did what they could, that no one wants to take the blame
Yes, massive shitshow
You can't just throw that out there without linking the video, my man
what i seriously don’t get is how people like this allow people to film them
like it’s going to get leeked if it exists so just don’t let people film you
Yup
Hauglie probably have to leave her post as minister of Labor, but I doubt any real blame will be placed in the end
Labor (party, not department) was in charge in 2012 and the conservatives today, neither want to rock the boat so to say
If Labor was not involved I’m guessing they would hammer this case more, now they leave it up to Social Left and Reds
I think the problem is deeper than who were in position at that time
There’re many here who are possible to blame, but the ones who sit in positions now and have been watching this lately clearly have to take some responsibility
I can see this raise questions about if we need better routines and systems in the future, but I doubt they’ll dig that much for someone on benefits
Had some slivovica in Serbia, that stuff is awesome
Blew the liquor quota on the way home
Whenever i travel through western Norway and come across fjords and valleys with dialects that i literally can not understand
My mind is  like "We speak the same language
What the hell
I should be able to understand you
What is this
I remember when i was a kid and we were going on a fishing trip with my dad to Hitra and this was in the early 2000's before gps and google maps
We stopped in the valley of Surnadal and my dad went to ask some local who was at at a strawberry stand the way and i watched him talking to the guy for five minutes and gesticulating wildly before coming back to the car
I asked him if he got the right directions and he just said "I have no idea what he said
lets just get to the next gas station and buy a map
I live in western Norway
Whenever I travel to Oslo I can't help but feel like an outsider due to the accent differences
He couldn't be Norwegian
we do 90% of the time
Just some valleys where so inaccessible that even the 300 year danish reign failed to impact the local language
If you learn standard norwegian you will do fine
The problem lies within my/our awkward reaction and instead of asking "what the hell are you saying
" We just smile and nod our head
I'm sure if i would have been honest and told him that i do not understand he would modify his dialect to suit you
I think i can explain a little, though i am from the northern midlands (northern norway)
We can generally understand eachother at a mostly fluent level, but some dialects are so far from your own it takes a bit of time to get used to the special words and pronounciations that it will sometimes be inelligible unless the person speaks slowly and clearly
For a native this will most often be understandable, but in the small valleys and fjords it can be a problem,  but just tell people what words you dont understand and they can generally translate it into a more common Norwegian word, og even English og necessary
Don't they speak german/a German esq language in parts of alsace and Lorraine
Tusen takk
Du er velkommen her
Vi er glad i folk som liker oss så mye at de lærer språket vårt
Thats good ! Just dont bother peopke on the buss
In Norway we call it "Forsvaret", which translates to "the defence".
The main subdivisions are Hæren - the army, Sjøforsvaret - the oceandefence, Luftforsvaret - the airdefence and Heimevernet - the homeprotection
In norway its called the "forsvarsdepartementet" or in english "the departementet og defens
Looks like the definition of ministry is a department led by a minister, which would explain the English
I hate skiing
This is genuinely hard for me to admit, but I can't ski that well because of a problem I have with my ankle
&#x200B;
This is also kind of hard to admit, but I like the Swedes
Please don't tell them
I eat dinner for breakfast
In fact I eat dinner for every meal
I really don't like bread cereal and so on
I can't roll my r, and guttural R is truly a national shame tbh, disgusting asf to listen to
I don't like Brunost/brown goat cheese
My physics are fairly norwegian thoe, but I lost my blonde hair when I was around ten years old
Believe that's all tbh
I hate skiing
I don't want to go skiing and I don't want to watch our sportspeople skiing
Winter sports in general are terrible and boring
I don't really know how to ski
I mean, I get the basics of it, I'm just not good at it
I'm a bad Norwegian
Hello officer
This comment right here
Men hva faen
I've never tried it
Yeha, the ski-slope refers to a cheese looking like [this] after being cut
OP is a monster
Yup
wat
Please don't ever come to scandinavia
I have no clue tbh, probably will be soon
We need a travel ban
As you should
Do you at least snowboard
Nope
Yeah i like snow, but i hate the ice, so winter isnt exactly my favorite time of the year
"Ta en spansk en" - take a Spanish one
Doing something not entirely by the books
"Du store kineser", which literally translates to "You big Chinese (Chinese as in the demonym)", is used to express surprise
You don't hear it too often anymore, but I'm sure most Norwegians know the meaning of it
Note: you don't say this *to* a person as if you were calling them a big Chinese (person)
Svenske tilstander - Swedish conditions
Contemporary politicized expression used to describe all that's perceived wrong with Swedish politics, from a right-leaning point of view
Particularly referring to immigration, crime, and political correctness
Det er helt gresk for meg -- Its completely Greek for me (I don't understand any lf this)
Det er helt Texas -- Its completely Texas (Go crazy)
How about "Det viktigste er ikke å vinne, men å slå svenskene" - The most important thing is not to win, but to beat the swedes
An old one that’s sadly fallen out of favor: Sint som en tyrk -> Angry as a Turk
I love this
I like the Spanish
Very astute
What is stigmatised in other countries, but not in yours
Or vice versa
For example I recently talked with a German exchange student who said that he admired that we here always speak our dialect, and that speaking your dialect in Germany is (somewhat) stigmatised
You can of course also answer for other countries if you have knowledge
Oh, this one's easy
Whaling
For the most part completely uncontroversial in Norway
Seemingly very much so outside our borders (with some exceptions)
Whale meat
Damn
Didn’t know it was a thing that it’s considered rude
I don’t get how it’s rude
I though it was mostly in Britain/US that is wasn't accepted
It's not that common in Norway any more except in sausage, but that's mostly because there are so few horses nowadays
We call the prime minister and king with informal addressing
They're known by their first name
Did you ask him why he considers whale meat so much worse than beef
Our PMs are often just referred to by their first name
Jens and Erna being the two most recent ones
What do/did you do when the pack horse and such that got to old to work or injured though
We didn't breed horses for food here either, but they are/were considered good food when you didn't have a use for them any longer
Except the whales that Norway hunts aren't rare (minke whales)
And they're not farmed
Oh, that is such a good question
I would love to see a good documentary about Bulgaria
And Hungary
And Portugal
Traditional food, like eating sheep's heads
There is barely even any  food there aswell
I would say probably the "russefeiring
" From May 1st (some places starting even in april), high school seniors basically have an endless party that culminates with the constitution day parade on May 17th
In this period they dress up in onepiece-like suits and hats in different colors, traditionally red for regular studies, blue for economical or trade studies and black for vocational studies
Students tend to join into groups where each group buys and decorates an old van or bus, has a theme and stick together during the period
Some students, mainly from the western parts of the Oslo metro area, can spend tens of thousands of euros each on the "russefeiring
" They also have "knuter," which is a list of various challenges that will earn you a knot or a token in your hat
The challenges can vary from fairly innocent ones to more sinister
Some examples:
\- wear breadloafs as shoes a whole day in school (piece of bread in the hat)
\- finish 24 beers in 24 hours (beercap)
\- Have safe sex on the school premises (pencil)
\- Kiss a police officer (Sherrif's star)
And a few days after this is finished, it's time for finals
As far as I can see no Norwegian have answered, so my nomination will be [Russefering] which everyone besides Norwegians think is just weird and a huge waste of money
We watch that sketch on December 23
Studenten (whcih I assume is what you are referring to from Sweden) is quite different
Both are celebrations of the end of secondary school, but only the Norwegian one have the insane partying and money use associated with it
Okay
I'm not familiar with your tradition here, but if it is like the Norwegian one then I will also nominate yours for this thread
In Norway, that's always shown the day before Christmas Eve at 21:00 hours
He bakes a mean knekkebrød though
He had a symbol he liked to use, one of the old Indian ones I think, you could get a tattoo of that along with his name
I don't know
The fact that we decided to demolish so many historic buildings was very foolish if you ask me
Other than that I'm not sure if we have done anything particularly foolish
Going to overthrow England before the French attempted, ended up loosing a king and the French came three days after and cleaned up and got a sick island in addition
When someone in Norway find something from the Viking age, he has to pay the archeological survey, which is basically a recipe to let vanish the past
And this practice is continuing
You did end up on the winning side though, so it's probably less dumb than joining the war because the Brits stole your navy and then losing because the Brits stole your navy
I like [Ukraine's] 2004-2015 plates for their creative use of the flag's colors on the nationality identification portion on the far left
Comparatively, the ugliest plates are Norway's plates for 2 seater vans/station wagons of a certain volume and under 3500 kg total weight
They are green with black letters/numbers
I got a small van with green plates
I like the British and Icelandic ones
The British ones are yellow but look nicer than the Dutch because of bigger letters and a different shade of yellow
I love that Iceland displays their flag, it shows that they don't like the EU, just like us
Wow, they get letters and numbers that match the colour of the car
Oslo
A lot has happened the last 20 years, and there’s still a lot more to come
There’s a lot of new development
I’m from Oslo and I’ve always loved Oslo, but it’s a more interesting place to visit now
It used to be a bit more dull
Still has a lot of untapped potential though
Yeah, the number of skyscrapers compared to Krakow was noticeable
r/lfg
I’d assume you have “heat pumps” pretty commonly around in Sweden too
Those can also run as air condition during summer, except like no one I know uses the setting
New houses and flats like mine has central air systems and that circulates both cold and hot air depending on what temperature it’s set on, which also works like air condition
In my experience Norwegian at least don’t really use the term “air condition” (except for in cars) or talk about using anything to cool down houses during summer, so maybe that’s the same in Sweden too
Their gonna need it now that their pm want’s to try herd immunity
What guy
The guy who was interviewed by Norwegian TV2
Maybe that was just propaganda
The Guardian also [wrote about it]
On Sunday night, Tegnell told Swedish TV the outbreak would “calm down” in May but return in the autumn
“It will be important how much of the population is infected,” he said
“It will determine what happens in the autumn
” Coronavirus could be stopped either by “herd immunity, or a combination of immunity and vaccination”, he said
“It’s basically the same thing
Right, That must have been what I heard on TV2, I sort of just grabbed an article about it to be honest
So you're right he has backed out of it, still concerning though
I am sure the experts know what they are doing, the guy in charge here is Bent Høie
He used to manage hotels, So I wouldn't call him a public health expert
In the US the VP Mike Pence is in charge of the corona task force
These guys are not experts, you need to ask yourself if they listen to the experts they work with
A group of professors at Karolinska institutet & Chalmers started a protest-list, which over 2000 Swedish scientists from academia have signed
But I do wish you the best and I hope you can get it under control
Z isn't used a lot in the first place
If a letter comes after z in the word then I'll write it with a line one the middle
If the letter is the last in the word then I won't put a line through it
I write Z with a line in the middle, because in math, it could otherwise be confused for the number 2 if I write sloppily
For the same reason, I write a line in the middle of the number 7 to avoid confusion with the number 1
And I write write capital I (in math) with bars over and under to avoid confusion with 1
And for the number 2, i write a small loop at the bottom left - again to avoid confusion with Z. And to avoid confusion between 5 and S, I write 5 in two strokes
This is my own style, which developed over years at school and at university, as I had to write more and more math faster and faster
Same here for both Z, W, Q, X and C
Yes, given second names as middle names are somewhat common, depending on your other first name and how well they fit together
Many have their mother’s last name as a middle name as well
Yeah, and I think I know like 20 people with Sofie/Sophie as a middle name
My mom has three first names which doesn't really go well together
And when she was married to my dad, she had two last names, too
She only uses two first names, one in her home town, one where she lives now
Here it somewhat depends on where in Norway you come from
In North of Norway it is common to have a double first names, sometimes with a hyphen in between
And they use both
Most of my family on my mothers side have a second name, but we don't use it
But on my fathers side it is not that common
And they are from the south-east
So in Oslo I feel it is about 50/50 if they have a second name
Very very common
But what about their last name after the fact
Example being Olga Fedorovna (patrynomic) Yarlmenko
She would never be addressed using the last name
What if you don’t know the persons patronymic name
So interesting
Thank you for this response
Haha funny enough I actually do speak Polish
But this is still super informative
Saying "best thing since sliced bread". That idiom doesn't make any sense at all
How they are so scared of just being American and feeling a need to hyphenate and find some sort of nationality through genetics or outdated country customs
Ok the flip side of things they are also fervently proud to be American and it's the greatest place ever
This is a Norwegian thing, too
It dinged my fucking 2 week old car (new to me, very good condition Touran R-line Exclusive Edition, my first grown-up car)
I was furious when I discovered the dent
Norwegians have become too rich and selfish the later years
Saw someone say they didn't know how much fabric they got because the guy told them in feet when apparently they were used to yards
It took me a solid 10 seconds before I realized they can't just convert it on the fly as easily as metric can
Because presliced bread is shit bread
I know where it comes from and how it's used
But the idiom suggest that pre-sliced bread is a good thing and since Norwegians aren't fond of pre-sliced bread at all the idiom just doesn't work for us
We don't put our flag on things like the McDonalds logo, but it's the same wierd patriotolism here around food, norwegian salmon etc
Used to be very normal having small norwegian flags on the Christmas tree aswell
No, I was agreeing with the comment above
I do get the idea of short traveled food, but here in Norway it has been proven to be a lie
Salmon being  [sent to china for packaging and then back]
Short traveled also does not mean Climate-friendly,  E.g. spanish tomatoes leave a smaller carbon footprint than greenhouse grown localy in Norway:  [
Yeah, there is there is definetly some good things that are short traveled
But, as with the sammon, "short traveled" can be a direct lie, and its more of a marketing gimmick, Im starting to lose trust in all of these markings claiming things are fair trade/short traveled etc
[Vennesla library]
[Barcode] Oslo
The library in Tønsberg, Norways oldest town, built in 1992 over the ruins of Olavsklosteret (The convent of St
Olav)
Some of the ruins are inside the library, some are outside across the street
[Tønsberg og Færder bibliotek]
[Olavsklosteret]
And the [new Deichmanske main library]
The building it replaced, from 1933, was beautiful, [especially inside] But it was cleverly designed that you could not get from any point in the building to any other point without going up or down stairs
Gorgeous but very very impractical
Barcode and the [Opera House] are good, the new [Munch Museum] is really bad
Yeah, I never liked that one
The original design of the Munch Museum, with more glass on the facade, was much more graceful
Sometime shortly before construction began, it was decided that so much glass would be too expensive to maintain and would not be environmentally sound (if I remember correctly, it would make heating and cooling the building too expensive and resource intensive)
So new cladding was needed
Unfortunately they made a terrible choice
[What we were promised versus what we got
] Opinions may differ on the original - I quite liked it - but I think there's pretty broad agreement that the actual building is butt ugly
More uniform economic policies and regulations, and a more integrated European military
That would at least make sense on the international stage these days
Less reliance on the US, and the abolishment of tax havens within Europe
As long as we're not part of it, you can become the USE by all means

The snow queen
Wasnt it only inspired by it
Isnt the book about an evil snow queen or smth
And from my research, its not inspired by austria at all
The scenery of the kingdom was inspired by Bergen and other elements from other norwegian towns, not a single mention about Austria in any of these websites
Edit: Nvm, found a website that said parts of the main town was inspired by a town in austria
We learnt about it, yes
Yes, we did learn about the winter war in School here in Norway, but it wasn't until much later in life that I understood how amazing the Finnish victory really was
Talk about winning against all odds
And of course you have Stalin's finger - and yes, I know it is a myth, but it is a cool one ;) hehe
Oh yeah, we get a page or two about it
The war is mentioned in my book, but my teacher told us to skip that part
Mentioned as a prelude to ww2, along with the Spanish civil war, I think
There is a fell voice on the air
That is a very good question, and I'm not old enough to remember, but I have done a little research (hopefully better this time
) and have found the following:
The Norwegian population in general sided wholeheartedly with the Finns, and 895 Norwegians served in a Swedish organisation called "Svenska Frivillegkåren" who fought on the Finnish side
Some of the most famous members of the Norwegian resistance during WW2 were in this group
Also, money were raised among Norwegians as well as supplies were gathered and sent to support the Finns
In one day alone during a ski sports event in Holmenkollen some 50 000 pairs of shoes, 100 000 rucksacks filled with supplies (food, tobacco, mittens, scarves etc
) and 16 000 woolen blankets were collected and sent to Finland
Weapons (mostly Krag-Jørgensen rifles) were also sent
The Norwegian author and Nobel Price winner Sigrid Unset donated her Nobel price to the Finnish fight in January 1940
The Norwegian government donated in secrecy 12 German 7
5 cm m/01 field cannons along with 7 166 artillery shells in february 1940
Norway also secretly permitted transit of military aircrafts to Finland through Sola airfield
Around 1 000 Finnish refugees were also received and cared for when they crossed the northern border between Finland and Norway
So, I believe you can safely say that the Norwegian people were firmly on  Finland's side in this conflict
You're right, I see
Before the real warfare started though
Norway was invaded April 9th 1940, so the things I described all happened before the invasion
Of course that changed everything, and as I said - many of the near 900 people who went to Finland to fight returned to Norway to fight the Germans and some of them are legendary war heroes
And any aid to Finland through Norway was made impossible, since Sweden rather quickly closed their borders towards Norway after Norway was invaded since the Swedes were neutral during WW2
So not only did Norway have enough on their own plate after the invasion, but the Swedes put an effective halt to whatever was going on between Norway and Finland already
The [Nidaros Cathedral] is probably the most well known building in Norway
One of the most beautiful buildings in all Norway in my opinion, if not the most beautiful
The [stavechurches] are also very impressive
Built in the middle ages, they were build by supporting wood, and without nails
The estimates are that 1000 to 2000 such churches existed in the middle ages
Only 28 are left
The Troll A plattform is insane, but because it was moved to the North Sea and today is mostly underwater, it does not get much attention
And I am amazed by what they could build out of timber 800 years ago
The stave churches are a good example of that [
It might not look so impressive today, but thinking this was built when Christianity first came to Norway - right after the Viking age - I find interesting
The stave churches
They're big, beautiful and they're built without nails
[You're not alone]
It certainly was something, lots of WW2-era tanks and cold war-era missiles and such on display in a historical fortress, then further on in there were dinosaurs
Big ben
Isn't that just the name of the bell
what was the deal with the dinosaurs though
Found a 2006 survey from a newspaper
The bottom three were
Phonesales (14%)
Doorsales (9%)
Realtor (9%)
On the other end we have
SAR pilot (9%)
Firefighter (8%)
Doctor (8%)
Parking guards, phone sellers, debt collectors
Same in Norway
I don't mind, they provide good content
Also, a free broadcasting service which makes content gives acting and entertainment jobs to Norwegians instead of making them have to go abroad to work in media
It's like crowd sourcing media entertainment so that we can provide a steady monthly service to those in an otherwise risky industry
Can't complain
Yeah, the first three are those who is most disliked, while the last three are those most liked
Oh absolutely
They need to rescue skiers, base jumpers and avalanche victims in the harshest mountain sides and weather conditions
Imagine hovering above a mountain with only meters to spare between the rotors and the cliff face
Or landing in the snow when the rotors whirl up the snow to near zero visibility
Those guys are something else, I can tell you that
Last summer my mother had lost her bag on one the trains
And only minutes after she had left the train a guy from the lost and foud called her
She did not have a name tag or anything on the bag, but the guy had gone thru her documents in the bag looking for contact info and had found it
Only thing the guy wanted was a 3€ fee, which had to be paid in cash

Worst thing is that adherents of both extremely polarized political parties cried about what horrible injustice he supposedly faced
Trump supporters support anything Trump says and don't like Americans being sentenced abroad, and prominent democrats called it racism and received a surprising amount of support in the narrative that Sweden somehow is much more racist than the US
And then the media with the inhuman conditions you mentioned

Now I want a stronger EU to distance ourselves from lunacy
> (we dont have bail and whats the point with bail when a rich person can just pay the bail and flee the country
I don't see the point of bail even if the person has no plans of leaving the country
I find it mind boggling that someone came up with a legal system only benefiting the wealthy part of the population
I remember this vividly, it was a shitshow
At some point someone leaked the documents relevant to the case, interviews, evidence reports etc
It was all in Swedish so i had a look through a lot of it, and what became aparent is that the Victim was propably on drugs, his friend actually said they were at the kiosk to buy hashish
He had harrassed the group that included ASAP Rocky, they were constantly asking him to leave but he came back several times
At one point an altercation happens, not clear as who started it as both sides blame the other, but a pair of headphones belonging to the Afghan guy (victim) were thrown away, and thats when the guy punches the body guard
Again, ASAPS Crew move away
The Afghan guy keeps following them now claiming hes entitled to a compensation for the headphones, A girl comes and asks whats going on, also mentioning that the Afghan guy had harrassed her friend at an earlier date, some discussion happens between the parties and shit goes down, at one point involving some glass beer bottles
Now, both parties are guilty of crimes, I can only guess the reason ASAPS crew didn't want to push charges as they might be obligated to show up in court (bad idea when you're on a world tour)
So, the best advice in situations like theese: Move along, don't give these sort of people attention
You might slip and end up doing something you regret, even how much you beleive the other part deserves it
Well
I hear a lot of stories from during WW2 when we had no (real) coffee over here
Made a lot of people unhappy
(But we had fish, fish oil and potatoes, so we did not die)
But I do agree with the Swiss government - rather stock pile for instance life saving medicine, instead of coffee
First time I hear this, so apparently non-news over here
What are others saying
I don't doubt for a second that there are quite a few people who would literally consider "stop force feeding" the same as "murder" - religion does wonky shit to people's minds
Edit: mad catholics itt
I think this is great
I don't know where the idea came from that it is harmfull for children to watch butchering
Yet it never harmed a single farm kid (or hunter's kid) who grew up with it
My personal opinion is that every child should kill and gut a fish they fished themselves at least once during their childhood
Glass houses, etc
- although if correcting for size, it's closer to "People in crystal doll houses should not throw planets
> A Chinese woman (I think the mother of the family) was rolling around on the ground, wailing, at the feet of the policeman
Reminds me of an TV-episode from one of the airports in Australia
A Chinese woman is bringing in illegal food (fresh fruit I think), and she made such a scene completely out of proportion with the situation at hand
Makes you wonder if making a scene in China makes people do as you ask just to make you behave normally again
Certainly an interesting part of their culture
Edit: seems like I was right
[Sort of
> A Chinese woman (I think the mother of the family) was rolling around on the ground, wailing, at the feet of the policeman
I didn't know there were any Chinese pro footballers
[Turns out adult Chineese ladies throwing a tantrum is more common than you might think
The Swedish government would never escalate the situation to a diplomatic issue, the tourists themselves might try getting media attention but the government would, at most, only vaguely comment that they are "looking into the case" and deny further comment
Every child should fish their own fish, and then kill and gut it
At least once during their childhood
(..is my personal opinion
Ha ha, yeah
I remember that show
If they weren't bringing in fresh produce or live animals, they were bringing in tons of cash hidden in their clothes
Yeah, his lawyer even specifically denied it if I remember correctly, but the garbage article from TMC has still not been corrected
> "at will" employment
What do you mean
So it's basically a voluntary tax, in a country that don't like taxes
Which is another interesting aspect of it
And they would have so much more money if they tried instead to work on lowering the re-incarceration rate
But that is a whole different story
Tantrums are rarely useful when dealing with border control
Or police I guess
Because it actually is: The American political spectrum is basicly centre to right compared to the European spectre
The Norwegian "Right" party: \*Høyre\* is centre to left compared to US politics

That is encouraging to hear
(The older ones wont live forever

I agree
And (although this hurts my soul to say): Swedish
In speech, yes there is a huge difference, not as much in writing though
The Scandinavian dialect continuum has a large difference in pronounciation, F.ex
[this site] shows an audio sample of different Norwegian dialects
If you click on one of the black dots on the map you can hear the same few sentences spoken by a person from that area
Two of the most noticeable differences is the use of guttural vs
uvular R, and palatalisation
Well, saying it's huge is probably hyperbolic, but when you compare the tonality, hard/soft consonants, monophthongs turning into diphthongs, R-pronounciation, wide -ld and -rd, I'd say that yes, the basic language is very similar, these small details add up to make the languages (and the dialects within them) very different in speech, from the eyes of a person who speaks neither language
Of course a person who speaks one of them will easily see the similarities, but I wasn't arguing against that
Furthermore I meant that the extremes are far from each other (f.ex
a Norrlending vs a Dane from rural Jutland), but you are right that from a foreign point of view, f.ex
Scanian sounds very similar to Danish
Finland, they definitively exist
If I see anyone mentioning a hot potato or kamelåså in regards to the Danish language, it's an instant downvote
If you make surrender jokes about France, I automatically picture you as an uneducated hillbilly who fucks his sister
Sweden
The hate it gets from some places is both absurd and offensive
Our scandinavian brothers mainly
We're all so similar, and have such an intertwined history that I feel like 'the privilege' to poke fun at eachother on the level of "danskjævel" and "fjeldape" belongs to us
As for the rest of Europe I enjoy reading the lighthearted banter between nationalities
I'd like to parttake, but I don't think I myself know enough about the countries in question to make it accurate enough to both 'sting' and be funny at the same time
When it's americans bashing europeans based on outdated stereotypes, it gets really predictable and bland, and most retaliation, if you want to call it that, is almost always met with low-brow ad hominem responses
Then again, seeing them get so upset is fun on its own
Any nordic country
They are *our* insult-targets, not yours
Whenever someone makes jokes about or insults sweden for being a warzone or the new middle east I get so triggered
(Norway here) I’m getting bored of the jokes about Estonia wanting to join the Nordics
It’s just gotten repetitive
Oh, and whenever I hear jokes about Iceland being
weird, I just think about all the weird stuff that Norway has, even if there isn’t as much superstition
Norway and Sweden have a love hate relationship
Constant jokes on the others behalf
Amusing to say the least
They are, but to be honest it's not because France is the butt of the joke
It's because it's historically ignorant drivel that usually goes hand-in-hand with 'Murican, vaguely messianic circle-jerking and because it's an *enormous* cliché that by now is roughly as funny as Amy Schumer and would be no matter whom it's directed at

"The giggling one". I did giggle a lot as a child
I have no idea where it came from or why my mom called me this but "berta knallfis attom nova". Berte/berta is another word for girl
Knallfis directly translates to a really loud fart, and 'attom nova' is around the corner
So it didn’t happen much but it happened a lot
Not confusing at all
Ah ok, that makes sense lol
I tried the danish intro questions or whatever it was at max level
There were sentences like "The dog is getting drunk". I got everything correct but a lot of the sentences were weird and one about whatching television was worded in a very old way accoring to a dane I know
I have never used it for Norwegian, but according to [this] post, it’s not very good
The Dutch one: "Ik houw fan banaaneuh en eet se ggggrrrgrgrgaaoggg in de ochgggchggtend"
You'd expect a "ja toch" or an "Euh euh Den Haag, mooie stad achtuh de duhnuh" after every Dutch Duolingo sentence, considering how The Hague/Rotterdam-esque each sentence is
Cigarettes
In this day and age there is no reason why something that dangerous is still available in every store
It's illegal here and still it's all we see
Several TV channels technically broadcast from the UK
And while we technically have a gambling monopoly, there are dozens of gambling companies operating from other countries, but advertise against Norwegians with Norwegian celebrities and often have Norwegian names
The result of all this is a giant loophole that makes gambling commercials very common even though they're illegal
A Norwegian comedy show in the 1990's tried a new version of this, ringing a doorbell and just stay there
The "victims" of this prank said it was super frightening
The guy just stood there motionless
The comedian admittes that it was the worst prank he ever did

Granted, around Napoli there's so much garbage, but the dog shit situation in Milan was a shock to me

It's polite to pick up your dog's shit even if it isn't against the law to leave it for others to step in

We have many trolls, nøkken (lives in bodies of water and lures you in), Huldra (sort of witch/troll) and some orc/gnome variant called tusser
But to go truly local: from my old bedroom window I can see an island that used to be where some of the old Viking kings had their seat
Since it is an island, it has many islets and reefs around it
There is a story of some seidmenn (evil sorcerers) coming to the Viking King in the Easter of 998
They wanted to punish him for brining Christianity to Norway
The legend goes that they summoned a black fog, but they couldn't control it at it turned against them
The King had them all bound up and put them on a small islet where they stayed until the tide came in and drowned them
It is said you can still hear their screams when there is particularly heavy fog
I see a lot of comments that think local means "in your country", but I'm gonna tell you something just outside my town

> "Näcken"- Quite litteraly "The nude one"
According to wikipedia the name comes from a old Germanic root meaning "to wash
>The names are held to derive from Common Germanic *nikwus or *nikwis(i), derived from PIE *neigw ("to wash")
[3] They are related to Sanskrit nḗnēkti, Greek νίζω nízō and νίπτω níptō, and Irish nigh (all meaning to wash or be washed)
We have him in Norway to, he's called "Nøkken" here
In the north of Norway, Draugen is an important figure, - often thought to be a drowned fisherman not buried in christian soil
He could drag boats and fishermen down in the sea, and he could also warn fishermen of death
We also have Fossegrimen, who lives in waterfalls, and is a magnificent fiddleplayer
If you came to the waterfall 4 thursdays in a row, and brought him «fenalår» (kind of a dried and sometimes smoked leg of a sheep), he would teach you his fiddle skills
We have Nisser, who are small beings who take care of the animals and helps out in the farm during the night IF YOU ARE NICE TO THEM, and bring them food
If you don’t feed them, they will do a lot of harm
They will hide your tools, destroy your crops etc
They kind of looks like a small version of Santa Claus, but with old, traditional Norwegian farmers clothing
Then we have oskoreia, which is a bunch of dead people who comes riding through the skies at night, especially during christmas
If you see them, your soul can be dragged from your body and you will join their gang
If you don’t brew beer for christmas, you are in danger of their revenge
On the night before the 13 of December, - Luciadagen -, the evil and feared which/vette Lussi could come flying with her band of dead souls
This was regarded as the longest and most dangerous night
Skratteskjær. Frå Avaldsnes
Yeah but i dont recall nølken being a man luring women and children into water
It does lure people into water though
Great contributions
How could I forget draugen and nisser
Oskoreia have I never heard of before
Cool
Yeah, the Draugs were originally a dead person who lived in a hill or set out to haunt people in Norse Mythology
Look up "haugbui" on Google
Definitely where Skyrim got its inspiration from
It later came to be knows as a spirit on the seas though
Its just that the word draugen is derived from the norse draugr
Which means something along the lines of ghost
Draugen in stories is bound to the sea, so i dont think you could call it the inspiration
When a beer costs 40kr (4€) in the supermarket, you pay for what you drink, and not everyone else
I liked the comment about how people who have ceiling fans are uncultured and narrow-minded
I LOVE the Scottish accent
Watching the crime series "Shetland" at the moment, and my favorite part of it is definitely the accent
Scandinavia is Denmark (excluding Greenland and potentially Faroe Islands) + Norway + Sweden
Fennoscandia refers to the peninsula where you find Norway, Sweden, Finland and parts of Russia
The Nordic countries are Sweden, Norway, Denmark (excluding Greenland but not Faroe Islands), Finland and Iceland
You go to a party, bring your own alcohol as any party right
And then someone just goes and takes form your vodka bottle or smt wothout asking
Apperently its normal to just take alcohol from others at parties in the US lol
Somewhat weird from my perspective as well
Up here "Black Pete" is a chimney sweeper (hence his black face)
[Here is a Norwegian card game called Black Pete ("Svarteper")] showing the chimney sweeper in action
Been there, done that
And loved it
Yeah
Never gone to a party without alcohol
At a normal party i bring 10 0
33l beers and some vodka/wine for myself
And everyone brings their own alcohol, maybe share a shot here or there if someone ask
Considering Mary Jane is illegal in our country, I couldn’t tell you
I wonder if it used to be a chimney sweeper in the Netherlands as well (it kind of makes sense that the chimney sweeper and santa claus, who goes through everyone's chimney, are connected
) But this is just me guessing
Must have been a popular card game since it's was spreading across Europe
> Musta Pekka
So Pekka was never a chimney sweeper
But then again I'm not really picky
I can't remember ever watching a  UK crime series I hated
That's why we have the Nordic Countries category
Maybe we are just a cheap people
Oh, i've never been to a family party so
> It actually originally was a reference to slaves,
Source
Your [Musta Pekka's clothes looks Turkish] Which is kind of interesting
Have not watched it yet
But that is the one where the dead police partner follows him around
Not cheap as in not expensive, but cheap as in geizig
Yes
It just comes naturally after a while, and you can tell when something sounds wrong
Like “en hus, husen» sounds completely wrong vs “et hus, huset” (a house, the house)
It also helps that generally most female nouns can be male nouns depending on your dialect etc
But genderless nouns vs female/male nouns sounds very different
Don’t know how else to explain it
> whether Nutella is neutral or female for example
We normally call it "a jar of nutella" which solves the problem since jar is neutral
I know a couple examples where it's not 100% clear
Like, I say "et kompliment" but apparently it's originally "en kompliment" (which explains the plural form "komplimenter" which I do use)
Naob
no says it's both now
And I guess many would say "en meme", but we do have the Norwegian version of that, "et mem", but I only hear people over 50 use that (I use it too actually, but only with said people who use it)
Yeah
I still struggle with it at times though
"Sender du meg nutellaen" sounds more natural than "sender du meg nutellaet", at least
And Nutella is just a poor man's Nugatti, which is also male
Yes, so I guess that means it's male in Norwegian
Chad Nugatti vs
Virgin Nutella
There is usually a parking near walking/hiking routes
And also if you for instance use UT
no to find a route, it will give you a list of public transport options to get there
Hiking is part of the Norwegian culture, and there are parking spaces in remote areas, but it isn't an organized thing
It's more like local government/local population initiatives
And even if there aren't any parking spots around and you want to check out the area, you can always find a flat area next to the road where you can park, even if it isn't a designated parking spot
Some Swedish series, a few Danish and a lot from UK
Not weirder than something like the HBO Chernobyl series, where most of the actors were Brits of some variety
Nobody with a line was of Russian or other post-Soviet nationality as I recall
Nothing I hate that I can come up with now, but I like the one about everybody being rich and hot
Sucks being associated with gypsies
What do you think about the guns & beer stereotype
All the grammar is complicated, but understanding it is pretty easy with a bit of practice
And the only "harsh german" I've ever heard was an angry-looking Berliner
Otherwise it sounds soft, and oftentimes a little silly
*All English are gay* is also my favourite joke to say about Englishmen (and women) so that’s good to hear
You can come to Norway with any nationality or cultural background and raise your child with them, but the moment you use violence against a child or take away the rights and freedoms guaranteed for a child on Norwegian soil you will not be allowed to be the child’s primary caregiver anymore
We can off course discuss that we as a state should help those parents to use legal ways of among other things disciplining their children, but alas I for one would rather live somewhere that is extremely strict on this matter than anywhere else
So the thing you might see as no reason Norwegians in general and our state institutions see as child abuse
Which isn’t helped by the fact that the state will never publicly state the reason for why a child is taken from their children so we only hear the parents side
I use a brno shotgun for hunting and I love me some urquell, I'm good
*italian have the same stereotype, except they fuck sardines
Born 1890, died 1986
Bad example, the whole reason they went to Vietnam was because the french couldn't handle it either
Point is, you also lost to the rice farmers after 8 years of fighting them
At the end, the french were defeated in a decisive battle and were forced to let Indochina go when the cold war powers met in Geneva
This was all pre-Suez, so a time when France and Britain still thought that they could hold onto their colonial empires
And it's not like the US only fought in Vietnam either, the conflict spread to Laos and Cambodia as time went on
If there's one war that the french can counter the americans with it's Iraq
If I'm just walking or doing nothing around 15 C seems to be the sweet spot for short sleeved
If I'm doing labour or exercising then lower, say between 5 to 10 degrees
This is also granted there's not a ton of wind
If there is I will usually throw on a jacket
If I’m moving around and it isn’t windy, 15°C is when I start taking my jacket off
I do carry it around though, for when wind happens or I stop moving
If I’m doing hard work, I might do T-shirt in 5-10°C too
If it’s windy, obviously, wind chill is a thing
That being said, I’ll get a heat stroke in 25°C and have to show extreme caution so I don’t get properly ill lol
Haha, I live north of the arctic circle, and people will wear shorts and a t-shirt if it is sunny and above 15
Tourists are so easy to spot, wearing winter jackets and stuff, even if it is above 20
Crazy
In spring, if it's no wind and sunny about 5c. In general in summer about 10c.
It depends on if it's windy or not
No wind: above 15°C. If it's windy then I'll probably wait till it's 25°C (which is very rare here)
If there’s sun but no wind, I’d say around 5-25
If there is sun but with wind I’d say 10-25
If there’s clouds and wind it’s probably around 12-25
We usually don’t get higher than 25 degrees C, but if its over that (i might just walk around in bathing shorts if the water is ok) i will probably go bare top and short shorts or bathing shorts
If we rule out wind: About 10c for short sleeves, and about 15c for shorts
This is my answer too
Wind has A LOT to say about t-shirt weather or not
The reason for that is the Scottish locals has had a colder winter and their bodies have naturally isolated itself against the cold
In the autumn/early winter, the cold weather feels cold
But it starts a process in a body sometimes referred to as "brown fat".
In a couple of weeks, the body adjusts to the colder weather by isolating with a layer of fat
(The Indian tourists have not had this process happen to them most likely, so it feels a lot colder)
So in the spring, people with bodies who have acclimatized to the cold weather, will feel   like 10-12C is quite warm and 20C like quite a hot summers day
But the warmer weather is our body's signal to loose the brown fat, so after a few weeks, 10-12C or even 20C feels quite cold, just as the Indians experienced
As a Norwegian this process have allways fascinated me
....h*e writes in 18C weather, sweating like it was 30C.*
Dismantling of the national railway system and selling it off to the highest bidders
Higher inequality and other right wing side effects
Why we allow right wing parties to be in control for this long beats me
They drove the country into a ditch in their first four years, and my dumbass countrymen gave them four more to set it on fire as well
During this period people have started buying more electrical cars than gasoline cars
Not to talk about the dismantling of the police, courts and counties
And all these new proposes to shift tasks and thus power from the courts to the police and government
**Leiv Eiriksson:** discovered America around year 1000
History doesn't tell where he was born, but he was the son of a Norwegian Viking called Eirik Raude
**Roald Amundsen:** first man to reach the South Pole on the 14th of December, 1911
**Thor Heyerdahl:** among many other things he did a expedition in 1947 by raft across the Pacific Ocean from South America to the Polynesian islands
- Our three Kings in modern times
- Harald Hårfagre (the guy who, according to the sagas, unified the country)
- [Colonel Birger Eriksen]
- loads of athletes like Sonja Henie and Petter Northug
- Famous explorers like Roald Amundsen and Fridtjof (Nansen Amundsen beat Scott for the race to the South Pole and Nansen was the first to reach the North Pole AND he won the Nobel Peace Price for his contribution on helping refugees after WW1), but also more recent ones like Erling Kagge
He was the first to reach "all three poles" (North, South and Mt
Everest)
- Many componists and writers like Ibsen, Grieg and Bjørnson
Might add some more if I think of someone else
Fridtjof Nansen should also be included here
Arctic explorer and humanitarian
I would personally add Haakon VII to the list for his refusal to recognise the Quisling government during WW2 and not capitulating to the Germans
I don't think we can take credit for Leiv Eiriksson
Eirik Raude was 10 years or something when his family ran from Norway to Iceland so I think it's fair to say Leiv was Icelandic
>Vlad the Impaler: Defended Wallachia gainst Ottoman attacks and was tough on crime
My guess is that he's famous for a very specific kind of punishment based on his name
I agree
I agree
Good job
My grandfather has lots of stories from WWII, however he did a lot of things he weren't supposed to (against the germans) and has asked me not to tell any of the stories
Someone somewhere in my family tree (I think it was my grandmother's uncle) served as a Spitfire pilot in WW2, but was shot down or crashed in the north sea a few days before the war ended
My grandfather was an engineer and was inspecting a nuclear power plant in Lithuania I think (can't remember the name of the power plant) when he and the other engineers found out that the power plant had the same fault as the one in Chernobyl
This might have prevented another disaster
Edit: [Ignalina] is the name of the power plant
One of my great grandfathers was a norwegian resistance fighter during WWII and the only reason the rest of the family knows this is because one time while he was in the UK he heard two veterans talking about dropping bombs on a factory
My great grandfather then told them that he was on the ground counting all the bombs that hit
He was very quiet afterwards, because he wasn’t supposed to say anything about it and it is more or less the only thing we know
My paternal grandfather was taken as a prisoner of war in 1940, along with all the other Norwegian conscripts, and stayed in a prison camp for the duration of the Nazi occupation of Norway
My maternal grandfather escaped to Britain, trained as a commando, and came back to do behind-the-lines work in cooperation with the Norwegian resistance
He said he was given an assassination mission in Sweden that was called off at the last moment, which I think he was very happy for
3 of my grandmothers brothers were part of the resistance during WW2
When it was discovered they fled to England in their fathers fishing boat (who waited 2 days before reporting the boat "stolen") and they joined the war from there
My grandfather on my dads side had some germans come into his house while he and his brother was hiding a either a shotgun or radio under the sofa pillow
And my grandfather on my mothers side were a OG fisherman in Lofoten, and was threatened with court-martial because he refused fighting because he was too busy fishing cod
(He was the type of man who litteraly went fishing in a hurricane)
My grand uncle on my mothers side fought against the germans in Narvik
I haven't talked with him but i've heard that he doesn't like talking about it
And when he once were asked about how many germans he killed he answered something along the lines of "I killed enough".
Jeg antar da at han har drept noen
My grandfather also felt bad for some of the things he did (also *against* the Germans)
It seems like such a strange attitude to be ashamed of acts of war against an invader
Our generation would have bragged about it on the internet
Were they the first English settlers in the US
Oh, he doesn’t feel bad about it at all, he just doesn’t want the, recognition I guess
The mayor of Rome
Having paid leave and job security and the like
It's basically the same in Norway (92% of new cars are now being sold with an automatic gearbox)
Cars are about equally as expensive here in Norway, but automatics are still super common
In fact 92% of new cars sold here are with automatic
25€/month for 100 Mbps
I pay 55€/month for 50 Mbps
No it isn't. He is (or was) very popular in Norway as well
And in Australia
"Was"  is probably right
The Fantomet magazine ceased publication last year due to lack of sales
The character is supposedly popular in India as well
Would "life coach" fit what "coach" is used for in Poland
"Mobbing" here too
That is true for Danish and Norwegian too
In terms of traditional street scams we don't really have them
Never seen or heard of it myself
The biggest rip off is probably "Flytoget/Airport express train" from Gardermoen airport to Oslo city centre
The express train costs €20 and takes 22-23 min
Whilst you can take the local train which is €10 and just a minute or two slower
The only time Flytoget isn't a rip off is if you're eligble for discounts, they give 50% off for students and if you're below 20 or above 67
But even then it will be about the same as the local train
Only bonus with Flytoget is that they have departures every 10 min, whilst the local is every 20 min
Unless you're in a big rush to get to the airport I would highly suggest to go with the local train
What would happen if you report a taxi drive like that to the police
You made me smile
Thanks
Really
Both sad and interesting that is is common
The advantage with it is that it's more comfortable, runs way more often and has a "if you miss your flight because of us, we'll pay you back"-policy
Which is nice
Agreed
Just be careful during rush hour as the trains get really crowded
Flytoget is still often more convenient since they go more often
Always used them when the company I worked for paid the ticket
but price wise the local train is obviously a better choice
What’s a great replacement
Haha, thought the same thing when I read this
What did you like about Oslo
Compared to most cities in Italy its rather boring
(in my opinion)
>  "if you miss your flight because of us, we'll pay you back"-policy
Yeah, that's definitely an advantage
> the nature just outside the city
True, that is nice
Nature is easy accessible wherever you live in Oslo
That students have to learn both forms of written Norwegian that we have
It's an abseloute joke this still exists and I'm suprised it hasn't been abolished
85% of people use Bokmål and 15% Nynorsk, vocabulary wise they're pretty much the same with some exceptions, grammar wise however they differ quite significantly
It's pretty much a massive waste of time, everybody is able to fully understand the other form without studying it and basically no one uses or remembers how to write in the other form once they're out of High School anyway
All of this makes up a substantial amout of the Norwegian subject in Middle and High School, the time could be put into better use
All of this will probably be abolished within 10-15 years but as is stands it's still something students have to learn in school
Lack of support for gifted kids
I don’t like that we have to take exphil (examen philosophicum) to study at a university
I think it’s outdated
I mean, we got it from Denmark and even there it isn’t obligatory anymore(to my knowledge)
Why
The thing is that there is no one spoken language
Norwegian has countless spoken dialects
The differences can be pretty extreme and affect the syntax, number of noun genders, the presence of the dative case and other things
To create a written language for all Norwegian dialects is no easy task
It's also important to remember that Bokmål (one of the written languages) literally originated from Danish and was later changed to look more like Norwegian after Norway gained its independence from Denmark
So in other words, Bokmål was Danish until about the year 1900, which is when extensive spelling reforms were implemented to bring it closer to spoken Norwegian
Bokmål still has plenty of grammatical features inherited from Danish, such as two noun genders (even though the three gender system is optional in Bokmål)
Nynorsk was based on the various Norwegian dialects and is made to be a written compromise between how people talk across the country
In Nynorsk, the three gender system is obligatory
Verbs are conjugated differently from Bokmål. Nouns are pluralized differently and many other things
Jackson Crawford explains it pretty well in [this video] I highly recommend you watch it if you want to understand the Norwegian language situation better
Well, at least you guys have a school specifically for gifted kids (Atheneskolen)
I wish we had something like that here, preferably close to where I actually live
EDIT: Private schools otherwise are not necessarily the answer, though
I'm not sure how it works nowadays but when I went to the later years of Elementary School(Year 4-7) we had 3 seperate math classes which ranked you on your level
This was only 9-10 years ago and can be seen as discriminatory in a way I guess
Personally I liked it since the classes were more suited to the pupils levels
The smarter kids didn't have to bore themselves to death and the worst performing ones got easier tasks
Short answer: it’s a philosophy class
Yep
That annoys a lot of people I know, because we would’ve never had it if not for the union
And our government can’t even see that it’s outdated, they’re just saying stuff like “well it’s always worked”, “we’ve had it for a long time”
Being married to an Afrikaaner
I find Afrikaaners to be very conservative, but I find Dutch people to be much more liberal
My husband actually feels more at home culture wise in countries like England or Germany, compared to The Netherlands
So I guess lots have changed since the 1600-something when the Dutch started moving to South Africa
One thing I can say though is that Afrikaaners are extremely hospitable
If they say "you can come and stay at my house" they actually mean it
And they throw the best barbecue parties (braai)
> Afrikaners are generally more conservative and religious
True
> a bit apprehensive at first but are welcoming if you get to know us
I actually find Afrikaaners to be extremely hospitable
And when they say "come and stay at my house" they actually mean it
I have no idea how Dutch people are in this regard though since I never stayed at someones house there
I had the shock of my life the first time in South Africa (15 years ago) when i realised that even walking outside could be dangerous (especially after dark)
And I know things have changed a lot since then
I friend just shared a story about a close call in broad daylight at a road crossing
A couple of people pretending to beg, and then trying to hijack the car
(The person was able to drive away)
When you live in a country where there is little difference between wealthy and poor, and crime rate is low these things are extremely shocking
I hope things will change for the better
> So egoistical evangelicals with a lack of empathy and an emphasis on "me first" isn't exclusive to the US
Neat
Could it be that this is more common in countries where the difference between the rich and the poor are large
Just a thought that hit me now
"Too many poor people to pay for so I don't want to help pay for them
My husband doesn't want to take myself and the children to South Africa at the moment
He goes there alone to visit family and do business, but the rest of us stays at home
Kind of sad, but we hope to visit Australia soon instead (his brother emigrated there with his family)
My husband said the other day that he has lost hos alertness that he had while living in South Africa
Like always locking the car doors when having to stop at a street light, and always paying attention to your surrounding to detect danger
And then I told him he is wrong
When we visit a shop, he will always know how many people are in there, and where they are located
Always
(I on the other hand can be completely oblivious to my surroundings when out and about
> I would go back but I would probably stick to the more affluent areas which is a real shame
I know
My husband have talked about that if we do all go down there sometime in the future we can stay at a friend's house which is located in a gated community, which is heavily guarded by safety guards carrying a gun
How on earth can you experience a country from inside a type of "prison"? But at least inside the gate you can safely go for walks
But still
My uncle told me last week about some people he knows that went on holiday to South Africa last year
They drove from city to city, and loved it
Obviously they never checked the safety advice given to tourists going to ZA
They could have gotten themselves killed
Around the same time a Norwegian tourist disappeared on the beach in Cape Town
Probably robbed and killed, but unfortunately they never found her body
Sadly she thought that going to the beach alone was a great idea
>Cape Town is OK but even so, you still have to be on alert
A Norwegian student disappeared from a beach in Cape Town last year
She was there with a group of students, but decided to stay a bit longer to take some photos when the rest went back to the hotel
She was never seen again
I am shocked that no one has told her that being on the beach alone is a really bad idea
I assume she was robed and killed, but her body was sadly never found
> That last one took me months to not freak out about
I had anxiety attacks quite often when we first moved here and I tried to walk alone
That is rather sad
But happy it got better
I would say Finland is even safer than Norway
That being said every city I have visited in Europe I have walked around safely, even after dark
(I have avoided walking around after midnight on weekends though, as drunk people can be a bit unpredictable, no matter where you are)
> Yea I saw that
Unfortunately people go missing so often in South Africa
She was either robbed and killed or trafficked
Or killed, chopped up, dried, and sold as muti
(I hope not)
More uncommon yes
But came to think of it as I'm watching [this documentary] at the moment
Well Norway kinda took Tacos from Mexico and its basically a national dish here at this point
Well, during part of the period that Norway and Sweden were in a union, the flags were supposed to carry [the Union Mark] popularly known as "herring salad". Nobody misses those flags
Not because of anything evil about them, mind you
They were just really, really ugly
Well, Norway did do a dick move back at you in 1905
Entire Norwegian cabinet: "If we can't have our own consular service, then we resign
All of us
At the same time
King: "Okay, I'll have to make a new cabinet then
Who's up next
Norwegian politicians:
King: "Seriously, this is one of the duties I'm required to do, is make sure Norway has a cabinet
Who wants to be next
Norwegian politicians:
Norwegian politicians: "Also, since you failed to do one of the basic jobs of the king, we've decided you're not our king any more and we're independent
King: "Now wait just a minute
Swedish government: "Right
It's war then
Important European Powers: "No
We're here to make sure there is never a war in Europe again
Because we're quite sure we can do that
Now you two shake hands and be nice to each other
If we all do that, there will surely never ever be a war in Europe again
The twentieth century is going to be so awesome
Call it even
If there was a yellow car passing by, the first one to yell "YELLOW CAR
" get a freepass to punch the other kid
Edit: turns out this game is played by kids in many countries
And it makes me think how weird it is that a game like this is globalized, before the internet
It's basically been passed from kid to kid across borders
We also did the first one
A friend of mine had an eisenhower dollar and they are huge
Same over here but with a bottle cap
We called this "blodfemmer", using a five coin (femmer) so both the name and the game is basically the same
Kongen på haugen is what we called your first game
Really fun, especially if there's ice on the slope
Same thing with snowball fights
We did snøbasing instead of your number two
Snøbasing is where you pull an unsuspecting victim down and shove snow into their coats and face
You had to be on guard all winter
During the warmer season, we instead put ivy or itchy berries down the back of your sweater
Same here, but I assume that it changed to yellow car as beetles became more rare
Nothing like an arbitrary reason to punch a good friend
I'll probably say something random, or litteraly just respond py saying: Oh, so you want me to talk norwegian
in norwegian
Not really, as the question only came up to me once
Me and a mate started doing a sentence in different dialects to demonstrate how different they are
But there is a tongue-twister that goes "Ibsens ripsbusker og andre buskevekster"
"Ibsens currant-bushes and other bush-growths/shrubberies"
I know how to pronounce the non-welsh pronunciation
you know, the easier version
still impresses people
Yeah, I get awkward and mumble something like  "weeell, yes, no, what do you want me to say, I don't know
" and then throw in an inhale "ja" since thats's supposedly unique to the Nordic languages
I believe I read somewhere that the name (or part of the name) stems from a train station, and was an attempt to drive more tourism there
Do you know of that's true
i think the llantysiliogogogoch part was added to the 'old' one
not sure though
Don’t mind me, I am just here to say I really really like your flag
I love the unique colors and it looks really good
Have a nice day:)
Side-note: I recently learned that for period of time some Europeans were not considered white in the US
Spanish and Italians for instance
And Irish people
Which was a surprise since some Irish people have a paler skin-tone than me
And I am Scandinavian
So I plan to look more into why Irish people were considered non-white
Probably something about the culture
Or being Catholic
Or maybe something else
> that Irish people were basically black but with pale skin
It's hard to grasp what reasoning they used to come to that conclution
> an article on it called "how the Irish became white
Will check it out
Thanks
> My grandma
That is surprisingly recent
> how pubs would have ‘No blacks, no dogs, no Irish’
In the UK
> Because the Irish were considered to be a lower 'race'
Which makes you wonder how they came to that conclution
> Because they were Catholics basically
So is most of the rest of [Europe] But maybe most of the immigrants until then came from England and Germany
ludo, star of africa, cards, ropes and ladders
Probably the 3rd biggest city Trondheim will be unknown to most foreigners(I hope most Swedes and Danes would get it)
Trondheim does have a fairly succesful football team that played many years in Europe vs big teams in the 90's and 2000's but as it's not named after the city it doesn't make the city that recognizable
Oslo I hope most people would get
Bergen is probably split, should be more known than Trondheim but far from everyone will know it
I don't buy it, Essen is on both ticket to ride and pandemic
In Norway we don't really have any big cities except for Oslo
If we talk big in norwegian terms, perhaps Bodø, it's in the north, but probably overshadowed in fame by Tromsø for it's size and turism, and Narvik fpr the historic significance during WW2
Maybe the northerners will disagree
Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim
The big cities that aren't Oslo
I remember it because it means little in my language
I think some foreigners will know Tromsø, but only because of the northern lights
Almost like they forget people live there, too
Norway doesn't really have "big" cities - even Oslo's population is less than 700,000 - but you could come away with the impression that the country is Oslo, Bergen, and a lot of empty space, which is not accurate
I mean, there *is* a lot of empty space, but with lots of towns and small-to-mid-sized cities dotted throughout
>It’s impossible to forget the name Mo I Rana once you’ve heard it
Yep
It's named that to distinguish it from other cities named Mo throughout the country
The word "mo" means flat grass/sand plain
Austria-Hungary
Edit: I.e., Østerrike-Ungarn in Norwegian
Østerrike-Ungarn witch mean Austria Hungary
Same in Norwegian: Østerrike-Ungarn
Though Wikipedia uses the full title: Det østerriksk-ungarske monarki
Is it true that alfresco fridge burning is a scottish custom
I heard My Summer Car was a documentary
It has changed once, and then went through several edits and addendums
The first constitution was adopted on 17th May 1814, but that was changed after a brief war with Sweden the summer of 1814 which resulted in Norway entering a personal union with Sweden
This is referred to as the November Constitution
Most of the provisions was kept, but the first paragraph about the sovereignity of the country was edited to reflect this
Since the procedures for editing the constitution wasn't followed this was in fact a new Constitution and not an edit
When Norway left the personal union in 1905 protocol was followed and ther was no break of continutity at that time
After that there's been several edits on issues such as voting rights, state religion, parliamentarism among other things, but in essense the document from November 1814 is still in effect
Among the most famous of edits is the removal of  the so-called "Jew paragrah" which was the final sentence in §2 guaranteeing religious freedom:
*" Jesuiter og Munkeordener maae ikke taales
Jøder ere fremdeles udelukkede fra Adgang til Riget
This limits religious freedom for Jesuits and catholic munks as well as barring entrance for jews
The sentence was removed in 1851
As a side note, the November constitution is little known among Norwegians
It was seen as an embarrassment
Most people only know about the May Constitution
In fact, in 2014 the Constitution's 200 year celebration focused mostly on the latter
The process for edits is a bit cumbersome by the way
Edits can only be made if two thirds of the members of parliament in session approves
An edit must be affirmed by a second vote the first,second or third time the parliament convenes after a new election
That means that an edit may take anything from 15 months to 4 years to approve
EDIT: clarifications on the use of word edit and change
How do you define “change” and “edit”? Because according to [lovdata ] there has been a total of 315 changes(endringer) from 1814 to 2014
I always thought of edits as “redigeringer” but what are you referring to here as you seem to mix them up a bit
Edit: and a number of paragraphs have been repealed so I would at least count those as changes, so where did you get that “1 change” from
No, there has been 315 changes made to the constitution
It is actually a fairly simple process that requires 2/3 of Stortinget (parliament) to be present and a 2/3 majority
Have clarified a bit
I use Change as in "Have been replaced by a new constitution"
Edit as in "text have been added, omitted or replaced in the current document"
Norwegian Bokmål: Ekorn
New Norwegian: Ikorn
Dialect where I grew up: Ikødn (I have no idea how you write it as it is just a spoken language, but it's funny cause the literal translation would be "in the dick", as "kødd" is a slang term for dick)
Ekorn
Not too hard i think
Looks like the same word as in Norwegian, though looks way more complicated than our "ekorn".
Eikoᶇᶇ [ɛikɔɲː] in my area
Lots
I don't think we should export weapons to Saudi-Arabia, for instance
And we should reimpose sanctions on Iran
Both are issues where my government disagrees with me
wether or not we want to join the eu
Norway likes to pretend to be a peace loving country, but sells weapons to dodgy countries
We also hand out the peace price, but are to scared of other countries reactions to nominate controversial people
We recognise Israel, but not Palestine
It should be both or neither
Also, Norwegian government are too scared of Russia
We are neighbours, and should cooperate more closely (while still keeping our military guard up)
We cooperate nicely in the northern parts, but that has been better
There isn't a single country that actively works to destabilize the situation in the middle east more than Iran (at least when only considering the middle eastern countries)
They have the largest network of terrorist proxies of any nation there and they have carried out attacks in Saudi-Arabia (as seen on the news), Syria, Israel and now they are blowing up some random western oil tankers just to drive up the price of oil
Their foreign policy is being the douchebag of the middle east, basically
And that's just their foreign policy
The domestic policies against their own citizens is, as we know, terrible too
All in all a terrible regime, that I think we should stay far away from and not do any business with
>We also hand out the peace price
"We" as in Norway and the Norwegian government have nothing to do with the peace prize
It's the Nobel institute that awards it and they are a private organization that choose to deliver it *from* Norway
This is a problem for the government, yes, but they can't do anything with it other than "recommending" not to do it
>Norwegian government are too scared of Russia
We are neighbours, and should cooperate more closely
Then you can say goodbye to help and support from USA
Love them or hate them, but their influence is so big that it is something we simply cannot loose
Choosing a totalitarian and not-very-democratic government instead goes against all our values
I know the Nobel Institute is independent, but when Nobel prize winners have to enter the venue for the ceremony through the back door, then it is safe to say we are hypocrites
I am simply saying that Norway should be on board with their decision
I am also not saying we should kiss Russias ass instead of USA, but to elaborate and continue developing projects like the «grenseboerbevis».
>continue developing projects like the «grenseboerbevis».
That I can agree with :)
Actually I have never heard of anyone doing this
The equivalent here is improving your grades after you're finished with school the first time
You can do this by taking an exam (privatisteksamen), and you can pay for private schools which help you prepare
In the stores they're sold in fridges, and I keep them in my fridge at home
That's the way it's always been, and I'm actually surprised to hear otherwise
I store them in the fridge
It’s what my parents always did, and that’s really the only place I have the room for them
Absolutely
My eggs
Or chicken's eggs
lol
But seriously, we put ours in the fridge
For those who don't, what is wrong with you
I put eggs in the fridge
I've never seen anyone do that
Are you from a rural area
I saw a video explaining about the different methods a couple of weeks ago
But it really just made me wonder more, since we've always stored them in the fridge here in Norway
Video:
I have this weird feeling he might be from Fyllingen
Edit: Or Fyllingsdalen, as I guess the place is called
Whether you should stack the firewood with the bark up, or down, like an idiot
I mean, literary everything
It almost became a constitutional disaster some years ago when they discussed wheter to have friday—closed kebabstores in Lillestrøm (because myslim's sacred day is friday), a small town near Oslo
Norway is already pretty divided over wheter we should keep stores closed on sundays or not
So yeah .... It ended with the them deciding to have muslim stores/kebab—stores closed, but only in Lillestrøm I believe, so I don't know how good they can enforce it
Linguistically it is a mess to say the least, with Bokmål, Nynorsk, Rigsmål, Høgnorsk, Samnorsk and literary a tousand other varieties with only minor differences from the main ones
And if you are in a bokmål—dominated area and say like «mjølka» which is in dialects, samnorsk and nynorsk they will point it out
Same goes the other way around, «melken». And many nouns fet 3 genders this way, some even kind of five (since Nynorsk can conjugate nouns in 2 regular ways, like elv**e**r and elv**a**r), so yeah, it's that
German may have Der/Die/Das Nutella, but we have «Søppel» with 6 different declinsions in Bokmål. Høgnorsk had 8 in one noun, but I can't sadly remember it rn
click on a blue letter
F, we norwegians really have little to do ...
Whether it is correct to eat fish or porc on christmas eve
Soft, you stinky heathens
le nutella
Der Nutella
ye, in norway it’s tsjekkia
It was actually meant to be had by mid day, middag, Mittag, but development happened
Back in the days when people where farmers or worked on farms they had the meal about noon, some almost still have, at least eats dinner (middag) early (before 16, maybe 15 ish)
The farmers were up early, had some food then, some snack and break maybe before 12, then the big meal around 12, some food again later in the afternoon and the evening perhaps
You get the point
With the industrialisation, later more service oriented economy, office jobs and fixed work hours from 8-16, this got out of fashion
Including maybe more continental influences
We also have a saying “fine folks dine late”, I don’t know quite where that leads really
At ours dinner (middag) is normally 18-ish, often not before 19
I can’t help but think about the bigger, longer lunches that are normal in some countries in Europe and beyond and the lighter dinner/supper/evening meal later in the evening
Might be a parallel
The expression middag has only stood by and survived the development
This is a debate that has been going on for at least 20 years now
There are books on the subject like: [Norwegian Wood by Lars Mytting] which is a very good read, at least in Norwegian
Bark-side up makes the firewood stack in a more stable way and also the bark will shield the wood from moisture that usually comes downwards
Bark-side down makes the moisture escape faster because moisture escapes easier upwards
If you are stacking firewood outside you want the bark-side up to prevent more moisture
But if you are stacking indoors it doesn't really matter as long as you keep the stack off the floor and in a well ventilated place to prevent rot
We call apples for sweet apple
Potatoes have the name of apple
Fries we call pomfri or chips
Then snack potato chips is potetgull (potato gold) or chips
Then the mixups continue lol
Mohahaha
Íslens*K*a
Yes, I know, my comment ended up longer than I first thought
as usual
It was a curiosity worth mentioning
This race to eat early drives me mad as well, I just don’t understand it
I guess some up here adjusts when they eat after the time of the year and daylight, longer days, later meals
I don’t know how it is up north, where the light or lack of it is really noticeable
I guess some just are traditionalists
Turning the upper layers upside down is a popular way of solving the problem in a lot of places
ahh ok
My lingustics studies commence in a month, will be more informed then xd
Swedish speakers have a hard time distinguising ch- and sh-, so you often hear them pronounce "chair" as "share"
Take on me is a classic
It isn't easy, but there's always someone who thinks they can do it
Two songs that are quite specific to my corner of the country would be
Tore Tang (Mods)
Hjerteknuser (Kaizers Orchestra)
Both are to be sung very loudly, very badly, in chorus, with a sort of wistful twinkle in the eye (twinkle may be due to alcohol as much as sentimentality)
also, Barbie Girl by Aqua (although they are Danish-Norwegian, so only half-counts i guess)
Especially during sommer I would say Idyll and En Solskinnsdag are songs everyone sings along to
Tore tang for lyfe
The popularity of Mr Brightside in the UK is insane
It's a song from 2004 by a band from *Las Vegas,* while everyone seems to think they're British for some reason
It has a record of being in the top 100 Singles Chart for a whooping 240 weeks, and as of 2017, it had charted on the UK Singles Chart in 11 of the last 13 years
I live in Norway - Am i going to Oslo, or further on to Sweden
Train
Anywhere else
Plane or Car/Bus depending on if there is seawater between me and the destination as the crow flies
North of Ålesund: Plane
Sweden: Car and Train
Rest of Europe: plane
EXCEPTION
Denmark: Boat and or Car depending on what I feel like
Trains out of Norway isn’t much viable
You have to go through Sweden, change a few times, get to Copenhagen and then get on to your destination from there
If there was viable solutions that would take me down the continent over the night directly
Sure, yeah, but until then it has to be plane
I'd say when flying takes longer, including getting to and from airports, security and all that
Price is also an element though
Trains go 80 km/h, planes go 800 km/h. Factor in that we live quite a way of travel avay from the continent by train, and it's a no-brainer
I’m Norwegian having been living in UK, and If it was affordable I would take the train back and forth and everywhere else
But the airplane is so much cheaper that I can’t justify taking the train on my budget
I have paid more taking the train to the airport than I paid for the flight
so stupid and so bad for the environment
For some of us it is much easier to drive to Sweden
Oh yeah true
I’ll change it
I was just thinking of Stockholm for some reason, but I have driven to Sweden a lot of times when I think about it
Don’t know what I was thinking
The only socialist country I know of is North Korea
Sweden is a Social Democracy
That is (very) different than Democratic Socialist
Just for interest, how would you describe USA's economic model
> Would you say the high levels of Union membership is the reason why the working classes enjoy such high wages / living standards in your country
And if not what is the reason why
Yes
Plus government policies strengthening worker's rights
The government gave every worker 5 weeks paid holiday for instance
Then there is laws about paid sick leave, how much overtime an employer can demand from workers etc
Unions make sure everyone is paid a fair salary
The leftist in the US also drives me crazy, because they paint a picture of the "socialist" Nordic countries that is not correct
We are not fucking socalist
> North Korea isn’t really socialist though
True
It's communist
> North Korea has even attempted to distance itself from communism as they removed all mentions of the word in their constitution in 2009
I would probably label them more as a communistic cult
I would say its a mix of unions and government policies and laws
> It's not, and it doesn't even claim to be that
They claim to be a democratic people's republic, so what they claim to be or not has little value
Communism = *"a system of social organization in which all economic and social activity is controlled by a totalitarian state dominated by a single and self-perpetuating political party
"* [source]
So I would say they are pretty close
They have added a cult aspect to it though, where everyone is to worship and bow down to the "eternal" leaders
They call themselves The **Democratic** republic of North Korea
Which is both sad and funny at the same time
It probably helps that half of it was English:)
From dictionary
com:
I would say the first definition is how its supposed to work (but never did)
The second definition is how it always ended up working in every communist country in history
> The “communists in recent history” you’re referring to always claimed to have created socialist countries
So you have the Communist Party of the Soviet Union but the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
The countries were never described as communist, not even by their supporters
True
And that is where some of the confusion comes in I think
All the communist countries basically failed at socialism
As it was never so that the means of production, distribution, and exchange was owned or regulated by the community as a whole - as socialism is supposed to be
Ever
It always ended up as something that was forced on people by the help of the army, police and the secret police
And everyone never became equals where there were no classes in society, since the elite was always present, and always the ones ruling over the rest
North Korea
No country ever achieved to become 100% socialistic
But I would say North Korea is the closest you get at this point in time
In spite of them calling themselves the Democratic People's Republic
> All communists are socialists
What do you mean
Yet no country ever achieved that, neither through socialism, nor communism
So I see it as a dream that will not come true, anywhere in the world, ever
Nobel thought, but un-achievable
And very naïve
Only if greedy and power hungry people disappear from the earth that could happen
Until then we need to stick to other economical models
So what is this mystical middle ground like
Discount France
Some are blue, right
Same dude same
I saw the original Thing not to long ago
The only words I understand from the Norwegian guy was: dog not real
Same here
Yes, but the question was what do the movies get wrong
hahaha i love watching that scene
I’m Norwegian and don’t like fish
There are tons of bad English, but none of that weird skyrim-accent people seem to think is Norwegian
Yes, I've never met someone who doesn't. Learnt when I was around 6, I think
Not only can i ride a bike, I am a cycling enthusiast on club level
I ride, breathe, think and dream bike
I love the freedom of riding which road I like, or exploring paths in the woods
I like to watch and smell the nature
I like to feel the wind and sweat in my face, and the suffering of going all out uphill
I think I learned it around 5-6 years
I might've been a bit late, as I were a quite cautious kid
I know that I could ride my bike when I started school at 7, at least
i learnt it when was 4 or 5
I was around 5 when i started to practice with my parents
Every time i fell i would get angry and tell my parents i would never ride a bicycle ever again
Eventually i became good at it
Yep, I learned to when I was like 4 or 5
Now that I think about it, I don't know anyone who can't ride a bike
Yes, I used to bike competitively
I can’t really remember not being able to ride a bike
Same in Norway
The extra wheels goes off when we're about 6
I would die to see a horror RPG game based on the Norwegian butter crisis of 2011
It would be really cool with a game similar to Kingdom Come: Deliverance set during the Norwegian civil war era, I think
We sometimes call Sweden "søta bror" meaning "sweet brother"
I know the Danes sometimes call us mountain monkeys, "fjeldaber"
What about svenskefaen and danskjævel
Don't forget partysvensker
At first I thought it was meant as a joke on how bad the stereotypical brit tanned, then I saw it came from the irish
Sorry if offending
Mountains are to us what fields are to you
That's 100% correct
They are cute/sweet (both words are interchangeable for "søt"), and they are indeed our brothers/sisters
IKEA-bøger
It means haggling in Norwegian
Stein is also rock, and probably related to stone
That germony just came and we surrendered but mostly about the recistance in norway arter the occupation
How is that possible
How is the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact covered
OK, I understand
Maybe my perspective is flawed, but I've always thought of it as the most important and impactful event in history
The viking age ofc, and the period of "*Norgesveldet*" in the middle ages when the kingdom was at its largest after the civil wars (mostly 13th c.)
I would say the period after 1945 and before the 1970 when the country was more homogeneous and things like economic liberalisation had yet to be discovered here
But generally my impression is that most believe that we are currently living in our golden age and what differs is rather the views on how to best preserve the status quo
Einar Gerhadasens 17 years
Probably the same as yours, OP
Some romanticized idea of the sagas or some shit
Yes, for some reason we are weirdly proud of our plundering, murdering, kidnapping rapist viking ancestors
While conveniently neglecting or refusing to learn about English losses like the [battle of Patay] And as already mentioned, which side in the Hundred Years' War achieved their goals
Crispy duck is one of my favorite foods
Duck and turkey is also more common around Christmas
But eating hen is not very common
Chicken has taken over, and though I have eaten hen, that was at a restaurant and I haven’t seen it in any stores in ages
Chickens are the most popular
Turkey and duck seem to be getting more popular; fresh duck is easily available where I live but I don't see fresh turkey so often (unless you call lunchmeats fresh turkey)
There are people who hunt grouse or similar game birds and eat that, but that is not common
Except for chicken, we eat a whole turkey every new years eve
Kind of like american thanksgiving
Ducks are also eaten, but not very often
Ive only eaten it in chinese restaurants
Some poeople hunt and eat grouse or geese
I think that sums it up
Bird that isn’t chicken is usually a meal for a more fancy situation
In my family we do it a lot of goose, as we hunt and our neighbour has a goose infestation on his crops and we help him thin out some of it
We eat duck maybe two/three times a year, and about the same frequency with hens (we use them to make Coq au Vin or however you spell it)
> Chicken has taken over, and though I have eaten hen, that was at a restaurant and I haven’t seen it in any stores in ages
They'll have hens in the frozen meat sections of the shops
I use it maybe two or three times a year
I’ll take a look next time
Same here, I buy a hen maybe 3-4 times a year and make broth and hønsefrikasse
Duck has become our new years eve dinner
I’d say most cities in Finnmark
Finnmark was bombed and burned to the ground in WW2
There was nothing left, so the cities have been rebuilt quickly, cheaply and without proper planning
Alta, Finnmark has many times been voted Norway’s ugliest city
In Norway, northern Cities like Kirkenes are pretty easy picks
Had to be rebuilt mostly from scratch after ww2, quick and cheap
I say mostly, since some of the foundations were still useable in the new constructions
I retract my statement
Kirkenes still has a lot of the rectangular blocks, but has made efforts to be more presentable
Alta, (another Finnmark city) is pretty ugly
(And was also burnt to the ground, but not bombed as much)
I would like to add Førde
There was a book a couple of years ago that wrote about the ugliest towns in Norway
I don't remember the books name, but it listed Sandvika and Gran atleast
You can not have been there then
LU isn’t bad
Living in Frankenthal made it easy to avoid LU and go to Mannheim
I've lived in two vastly different parts of the country - the north and the west
I mainly speak in a northern dialect, but I work with children so I speak in a broken accent most of the time to them
If I were to get mocked in any way, it's because my accent is so fucked up, lol
In general only my grandparents complain that I changed my dialect from western to northern
Yes
Everywhere I go
Definitely
Yep
And yes, I'm from Bergen
I feel ya
I haven't lived in Bergen for almost ten years and have a pretty toned down accent, but I still get mocked from time to time
At least I'm not trøndersk
«Du e østlænning, du
Hadæ!». Had that a couple of times when I called people from Bergen when I worked at a telemarketing place during high school
I get it a lot as well when I’m not at home
Especially in Western and Northern Norway
Sørlendinger don’t seem to care
I’m from Oslo
There are so many dialects, probably hundreds or maybe even thousands
You can speak sort of "bokmål" (main written language) and it will sound kind of like eastern dialects
You can’t speak bokmål and the Eastern dialekts are incredibly diverse
There’s a huge difference between me from Oslo, someone from Ål or someone from Fredrikstad
I’d argue that the Oslo dialect is way closer to some dialects from Finnmark than it is to dialects from Telemark, Buskerud, Hedmark and Oppland
The dialects along the Eastern coast are pretty similar, but Østlandet is way more than the coast
Please read what I wrote again
You can speak "sort of" Bokmål and it will sound "kind of" like eastern dialects
I know there are differences between eastern dialects, but please don't pretend that some people in the east will say that they wish they had a dialect
Bokmål and Nynorsk are both written languages, but a foreigner learning Norwegian can't really obtain a dialect without living in and speaking Norwegian on a daily basis
Innlandsdialekt
It would be a rural version of what we speak in Oslo
They’re more likely to stress the first syllable rather than the last and would usually use some dialectal words that aren’t common elsewhere
Personal pronounce will also often differ
People from the East saying that they wish they had a dialect are just ignorant of linguistics
Well yes, obviously
I don't think anyone other than those people claim that they speak "Bokmål" because if you know the first thing about Norwegian it is that we have two written languages and a million dialects
Yep
Some would even argue that the dialects of Western Oslo as well as finbergensk and fintrønder are Danish dialects rather than Norwegian
I don’t really dissgree
My dialect is far closer to Danish than it is to the dialects of for instance Trysil or Bodø.
-Messing up compound words (for example writing "kaffe bønne" instead of "kaffebønne" (coffee bean)
Many people tend to mix up og and å.
Og = and
Å = to (do something)
They mean completely different things but are pronounced the same way
Hvem and Hvilken
Hvem means Who
Hvilken means Which one
South in Norway they use "Hvem" on objects, like asking for a buss route: "Hvem buss skal du ta
Direct translation would be "Who bus are you going to take
But, also annoying I would guess, that in Midt-Norge (Trondheim area) we say "Hvordan buss skal du ta
Direct translation: "How bus are you going to take
Pronunciation of words that start with skj sk and kj
It seems to be a dying part of the language, but especially old people are a bit picky, as well as some younger people
Writing it is mostly fine, people don’t fuck that up too much
"Og" (and) and "å" (to) (in Norwegian)
Jeg var alltid klar over at tunfisk biter, men hvem er det ananas ringer til
Also messing up og and å.
Og means and, å means to (as in to do something), but they’re pronounced the same
For some reason, people from Bergen mix up these all the time
In the rest of the country it's not so common
Korsen buss skal du ta :D North chiming in for fun
I’m pretty sure that’s a dialect thing
I fuck up this to this day
Depends on the kind of internship
If you're doing it for job experience as part of your classes, No
but they usually only last a week
If its the two-year internship you need to get your trade diploma, then yes, they must be paid
I love the architecture of NYC
It is so grand, modern and vibrant
Totally different from what we are used to in Europe
I loved how big everything was,  it was really shocking to see irl just how tall shit actually is, my fav city ive ever been to even with all the flaws
Haven't been there yet
:( But I hope to visit one day
I'm fascinated by central park being surrounded by a wall of buildings
Yeah the subway is NYC is by far the worst system I’ve been on
Not sure if it counts since it's originally a book, but The Fault In Our Stars is called "Faen ta skjebnen" which translates to "Fuck fate".
Die Hard in Norwegian is “Aksjon skyskraper” meaning *Mission Skyscraper* . I guess it’s not really wrong about the title
13 Reasons Why - The controversial netflix series about suicide was translated to "13 Gode Grunner" in Norwegian which means "13 Good Reasons". Which is VERY misleading
English to English "translation": "Gleaming the Cube" became "Skate or Die
"Spinal Tap" -> "Hjelp, vi er i popbransjen" (Help, we're in the pop business)
"Saturday Night Fever" -> "Lørdagskjøret" (The Saturday Rush)
Not from english, but german:
"Christiane F. - Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo" became "Christiane F. - Å være ung er for jævlig" (...to be young is too devilish \[hard to translate exactly, here it means something like bad or messed up\])
You Only Live Twice is called James Bond i Japan (James Bond in Japan)
Same Tintin energy
Oh my gosh that's hilarious
13 Gode Grunner in Norwegian, which means 13 Good Reasons
I think that's very misleading
Someone in my building stole a pair of my jeans off of the drying rack in the laundry room
I also had a couple of doctoral students and a professor rip off a paper I wrote during my Master’s degree and publish it in a journal without crediting me or asking me to collaborate with them
Someone stole my phone once
Another time someone snatched my friends purse when we were walking back to our hotel in spain
Nothing serious
My apartment has been broken into
I've been pick pocketed
Threatened with a shotgun
Threatened with a knife
Beat up
I think that's the worst of it
Edit: Oh, and years of sexual abuse as a kid
Almost forgot about that lol
My bike was stolen and thrown in the river
Actually no
But I did walk passed a blown up post box right after it happened (it was next to my post box)
It turned out to be kids blowing up their teachers post box
(I guess they didn't like her very much
My snow racer was stolen from my home
Found it later at the bottom of the hill close to school
My backpack was stolen from work
My neighbour went apeshit paranoid on drugs and tried to break in and beat me up
Someone broke into our house when i was a little girl
They stole my piggybank and a bottle of homemade wine
Pickpocketed 4(!) times in my town Oslo
I have a tendency to end up at the wrong place at the wrong time
Oh and some punks stole my training bag with my used clothes and underwear
Monsters
Yeah, an attempt at debit card fraud
My bank was quick to pick up on it and everything went OK for me
Worldwide
You OK man
I didn't, I should have, but I didn't and I doubt it would have made a difference
I was one student, there were three of them (two doctoral students, one professor)
I was also on very thin ice in my program, and not very well-liked by my peers
I could have taken it to an ethics committee, but there's no question that they'd have defended "their own" at my cost
Unfortunately it's extremely common, and while there may be formal provisions for recourse, they aren't always feasible in the practical sense
I've learned this the hard way, and know plenty of people in academia who've been victim to the same thing
It always comes down to the professor's/administrator's word against the student's. Administration does all it can to look after their own, often to the extent that students effectively have no recourse at all
Actually not doing too bad considering
Can't complain
Life could be much worse
Splendid
God jul :)
The duo "Trøste og Bære" did some vulgar but amusing songs:
[Drita full før Drøbaksundet] about a drunken trip on the ferry to Denmark
[Villto Sääppää Kyllää Mi] in their own words, "a quasi-Finnish celebration of Arja Saijonmaa and Leningrad Cowboys".
[Jag är inte sjuk] parody of Swedish "dansband" music
Apparently popular with fans of the genre as well as those who hate it
Is Topgunn considered a guilty pleasure aswell
Fun fact: In Germany and Russia, Poland is referred to as the "kid land", and ww2 is called the "custody battle".
Scandinavnian too
Presumably most Germanic languages
English has mother tongue, at least
I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm not seeing the similarities at all lol
That's normal
Anything built after mid 90s-2000 would have these
I do see some student homes/old apartments that still have old windows
My apartment building has similar ones
I think it's more common in apartments than in houses
But I don't think the American style ones where you push it up and down exist anywhere here
How interesting
I live in a 10 year old house, and every window does this
And the house is not high end in any way, shape or form
so this is just the type of windows which are popular now I guess
How do US windows open
Here I've seen them in pretty much all apartment buildings, but rarely in private houses
I have never seen them here
Edit: I take it back, I have seen them, but they're not normal where I live (rural Oslo)
Can't remember ever seeing one up north
What
Oh well you live in Bergen again don't you
You guys are freaks
Oh ok
Never seen one of those here
Norway can be both windy and rainy so I guess we prefer windows where it doesn't rain in through the window when it's open
Apetor is the only one I can think of
no sadly
StreetmanTV, EMH (God's Trash on YouTube) and i used to watch Karlinorge alot when i was younger
Addexio from Norway
no sadly
Apetor
Jameskii
It's not old-fashioned, just formal
We mostly use it for introductions, congratulations, condolences, that kind of thing
In formal settings it's still common, and when greeting a person you have never met before
We have had a couple of big media cases about muslim men who wouldn't shake hands with female coworkers
One got fired from a teaching position, one didn't get a job he was interviewed for
Both claimed it was racism, I think the teacher sued and lost
There was also a muslim woman who wouldn't shake hands with the crown prince
I'm a dog person
Which you could probably guess from my username
I think I saw a map on r/Europe not long ago where it shows that cats are more common to have as pets in Norway than dogs
Edit:  [here's] the post
I think the cats are more common in Europe
I’m fan of both, but I’m more siding with dogs in general, especially bigger ones
If I would own one it would be something like a golden retriever or Labrador because of maximum cuteness factor
Cats are cool to pet when they show up, but having to rely on one would be absolute nightmare to me
In general I feel like Norway is about 50/50, but different neighbourhoods, regions and people can be more in favour of the one or the other
A woman in my building also does that
Languages in Norway by speakers:
* Norwegian: 4 320 000+
* North Sami: 7000~17000
* Kven: 2000~8000
* Norwegian sign language: ~4000
* Scandoromani: 100~1000
* Lule Sami: ~500
* Southern Sami: 340+
* Skolt Sami: Extinct in Norway
* Ume Sami: Extinct in Norway
* Pite Sami: Extinct in Norway
* Russenorsk pidgin: Extinct
* Rodi: Extinct
The smaller ones might be very unknown
Especially those who aren't one of the sami ones
Sami language
[Lulesamisk]  - a sub group language of the scandi indigenous people spoken by about 650 people
Sami, and Kven, however, the Kven language is dying out
All the dialects in the region really
At least Elfdalian is famous among language enthusiasts, the others aren't.
And we have two National written languages
I am an Uppersilesian, I am speaking both Silesian and Polish and I think that what the government is doing is a version of postcolonialism
They have refused to recognize the minority for 7 times over last 5 years, despite the fact that 150 k. people signed up a bill proposal to recognize the language and protect it
Kaszubski is getting 80M PLN a year to protect and care, but Silesia is getting none
Moreover, the Government (=Kaczyński, ruling party leader) is calling us "camouflaged German option". Recently they are even changing the names of the Institutes in Southern Poland to vipe Silesian language and Silesian people out
Institute of Regional Culture (Instytut Kultury Regionalnej) is now called Institute of Polish Thought (Instytut Myśli Polskiej)
I hate that and, sorry to say, Poland is going to be the reason we have less variety in our society because the language and the culture will not survive
As for now I am supporting Silesians from abroad as I refuse to live in this irrational and crazy country where everything what is considered normal is to be Polish Catholics with no minorities, other religions, no Germans and no Jews, but to mention LGBT people and movements
Poland is taking a huge step backwards and I hope people who do that will drown in their own gravy
Do they have 3 in Finmark though I wonder
HeidelbergCement is huge it seems
Only learnt of them when my engineering professor told me they had aquired Norway’s biggest cement manufacturer NorCem
Are you reliant of a car where you live
I’m 27 and I don’t hold a driver license, even I could’ve had one for close to 10 years now I’ve had no real use of it
Living 30 minutes outside of Oslo I can manage getting around by train, trams, metro, buses and electric scooters
And it’s faster than going by car
I see having a car in the city as more of a plague than benefit
I’m free to go where I want, when I want, without thinking about parking and where to drive
In the surrounding countryside and the suburbs there’s unfortunately very much planned for car ownership and not driving is looked a bit weird upon
What’s your view
*add: This made pretty good response, I would like to be active in the discussions myself, but I haven’t had time unfortunately
Yes, there’re times when I could use a car as well, most places in Norway are relying on cars and if I would go somewhere outside of where I lived I would have to have one
If I just lived some kilometres away from where I do now I could need one badly
I see that for most people, especially around here, you need a car to get around
It’s also interesting that many use more time with public transport than car, for my daily schedule using a car would take the double of the time, I would get stuck in traffic and I would have to find parking and still walk or take tram or something to where I’m intended to go
no, i live pretty much in the center of Bergen, and so everything i need is within walking distance, and if not the train station or buss stops are
In theory: No
My grandparents biked 70 km to Sweden to buy sugar back in the day, so I have no excuses except time
In practice: Yes
I'd have to walk/bike almost 10 km to the store or train station to reach anything
9 km to school
Or 20 kilometres up the valley to visit friends
I can not be bothered, especially in winter
Right now life would be easier if I had a car, as I would get 7 hours at home between shifts over the 6 hours by using public transport
But on the other hand, I would not be safe to drive after a 12 hour night shift so maybe not
I would move to the other side of the city if my job wasn’t project based and eliminate the issue entirely
But nah I’ve been living 10 years on my own without a drivers licence in various places and it’s never been a huge issue
I don't need one but I'm glad I have one, especially when dealing with my kids' activities
How do you pick up a new sofa
Or transport a broken fridge to the garbage place
Now I do live quite rural, public transport here just isn't practical
I'm still at a loss for how I would be able to live without one if I didn't live rurally
Cause, I'd still have to go places that are rural
Whenever a big holiday comes up, I go back home and my car is filled to the brim
Snowboard, skis, clothes for 2 weeks, christmas presents, my PC (desktop with all that brings, yes I still do LANs), board games
I just don't see how I'd being that on the bus
I'd also be stuck in my parents house for the 2 weeks without one
Luckily those are not frequent activities, but I wonder myself how we solve these things in a pretty car based country in the future
I think we will move towards more electrical cars, not necessarily a more car free society
If you live on the countryside with children it is simply not possible to live without a car
And in the city there is already lots of people living without a car
(But I still wonder how people then get rid of their broken fridge
Taxi
Have some service to pick it up perhaps
Home delivery and such are services that I guess will explode in Norway in the coming years, if just the prices are fair, since people don’t want to go to places like malls anymore, they’ll spend their time more wiser and fewer got cars as well (at least in more central places
We’re generally a very easy target for internet shopping as well since many places are rural and variation is scarce
Norway is unfortunately very similar to USA in many ways
It's the same in Norway
Altough it's more about the noise
On sundays and other holydays you can't make  unreasonable loud noise
So mowing your lawn is too loud
This is to reduce noise pollution which is bad for your health and can cause heart attacks
Somehow I managed to read *the Baltics,* and the answers were so confusing
I think I need more coffee
There is a german fort from WW2 a few kilometers from my house
Also its not uncommon to stumble upon remnants from the medieval and viking ages, it often happens to farmers who find cool stuff while working their fields, i have also heard several stories of children playing outside and finding viking swords and other artifacts
I dont live in a city, but the one closest to me (Trondheim) was founded by the viking king Olav Tryggvasson in 997
There is a huge statue of him in the city square
I live in Oslo, pretty close to the ruins of a church from the 1100s. There's another actual church from the 1100s still standing in the city though, Oslo's oldest building that's still standing
for anyone interested in reading more about it
Interesting stuff
I am a teacher of social studies in Norway
In the national curriculum it says that students in VG1 (1st year of high school, 16 year old) must be able to explain the goals and structure of the EU and discuss Norway’s relationship with the EU
I know for a fact that we spend quite som time doing this, but it is all very theoretical and difficult to be able to explain in great detail years after learning about it
Norway’s relationship with the EU is what takes the most time and is debated the most
And as always, most Norwegians are anti-EU
As far as I know it isn’t really teached here, just mentioned sometimes
Best way is to not pay on the bus, because then it’s more expensive
Either pay using the app, or online
App or a travel card
Cash might be accepted some places, but that's far between nowadays
A card with RFID chip
I top it up two times a year
Its weird now, beeping my card in has become muscle memory
We are now going over to a new system where there are card readers on the bus stops instead of inside the buses, but the readers are still there
I've been told several times bu drivers that my second beep of the card is unnecessary,  but I can't stop
At least in my city, there are different ways, you can get a card and scan it, but i use an app that has a periodic ticket digitally
I buy a ticket that lasts for 6 months and then i dont have to think about it or show it unless the bus gets a check on, in which everyone has to show their tickets or get a fine
However since the checks happen so rarily and you dont have to scan anything or show your ticket to the bus driver, a lot of people just get on the bus without a ticket and hope they dont get caught
Mobile app is my preferred method
But you can also use a travel card (same size as a bank card containing a chip) or bank card
Cash is no longer used on most public transport
we have reisekort "travel cards" or we just use an app
where i live we have the app Fram which is for all the transport in our region except for taxi
in oslo they have a ticket app that goes for everything
so i usally use the app
An app for bus travels is pretty handy over here
You’ll get half the price using it, but I believe it’s different in the urban areas
Travel card, app and cash, from least expensive to most expensive
I never pay in cash, and when I used to take the bus to work, I used travel card
Now when I only occasionally take the bus, I use the app
Cash, visa card, card issued by the bus company, various apps
It think it's most common to just say "Smile
" which is "Smil" in Norwegian, and pronounced with a similar sound as the "ee" in "cheese"
Norway: Smil (smile) or appelsin (orange(fruit)) are common
Cheese here too but we can also say «appelsin» which means orange
We say «Appelsin» with a long i, which means orange (the fruit)
Don't forget _appelsiiiiiin_
For everyone else, that means Orange
(the fruit)
Norway, that's in Sweden, right
(I think/hope they meant to say Scandinavia)
I’ve only ever had the follow up question of “how is it like living there
Idk I just live here
Haven’t lived anywhere else
Sometimes during summer it gets really warm, and sometimes we have snow
What sort of answer are people expecting
Because they ask wanting to know the answer, not as a polite “how are you” greeting
Do they want a full breakdown of life from newborn to death
Do they want to know something very specific
I DONT KNOW
This made me lol
Do you also get the "what do you feel about frozen pizza"(grandiosa)
I have a Italian mate and I cringe every time he gets asked about this
I also hate it when Norwegians try to be special, "oh, we here in Norway all speak funny English and are really special"
Yeah, seeing these comments here, I can't really think of anything cliche or stereotyped about Norway that people could/would ask
The worst I've gotten was 'Wow, you actually exist
I thought Norwegians were like trolls and fairies'.
This is something I do not understand
I have several colleagues from Poland, and it is not cool to talk about abortions or corrupt judges
These topics is just a no go, and I dont get it
If they say Denmark, that is not so bad
Just not Sweden, our arch enemy :)
Yes, just like the UK used to be an influential European country :)
(We were a part of Denmark and Sweden and Denmark again etc for hundreds of years
So when we got our independence, we needed a King for our new country and
\*looking over to the Swedes in the east \*  ...we asked a prince from Denmark if he would be our King
I mean 30 is probably the highest we really go
I haven't checked the stats, but I would guess 25 is a good day
It can get around the same, but not very dry
A lot of coastline to go to on those hot days
That's great - the Minnesotan and the Norwegian agree that meaningless smalltalk is confounding
Classic Scandinavian memetic trait
Why would anyone confuse Denmark with Holland
Yes, definitely
When I lived in England I was asked how we deal with polar bears roaming our streets on a regular basis
But to be fair, Norway is one of the few countries where polar bears do roam in the streets
(It is on Svalbard though) :)
I think Sweden gets stereotypes for like hot girls and being dumb/having weird accents because of American movies
I guess you are right there, maybe some old testament fans are opposing abortion here in Norway but most people see it as a natural possibility to have
It is that blend between new and old way of thinking that fascinates me about Poland
Thankfully reddit exists, so I can hear it from you guys
I know, that really stings
We hate Sweden, Sweden and Denmark hate each other
Really makes the little brother syndrome flair up
We would trade all the Norway hype for you guys hating us like we love to hate you :)
>it's just love
It is
We hate you in the most loving way possible
And Norwegians don't want to say this loud, but we think Swedish is the cutest and downright most sexy language in the Nordics when spoken by the opposite sex
That said, you don't really have much competition (trying not to look at Finland, that would be awkward)
You surely meant to say you should not throw potatos in glass houses
And to Danish people, that means ...shhhhsss :) When you chough up that potato, don't throw it
People can now cross the border to Russia and buy dirt cheap gas (1/4 of norwegian prices)

We introduced the Japanese to the salmon
We've [knighted three penguins]
We had a big, nationwide butter shortage in 2011
Dying is illegal in Svalbard
The world's most remote island is a Norwegian territory (Bouvet Island)
Norway is further north, west, south and east than Finland, and Kirkenes is as far east as Cairo
There's a place called Hell
Income and wealth of all Norwegian citizens is on public record so anyone can check how much everyone earns
Norway has 368 medals in the winter olympics, which beats USA in 2nd place with their 305
Around 98% of our domestic electricity is run by hydroelectric power
Norway supplies London with the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree every year as a way of thanking the UK for sheltering our royal family during WW2
The first people to reach the south pole (Roald Amundsen), to cross Greenland (Fridtjof Nansen) and to reach "all three poles" (North, south and Mt
Everest, Erling Kagge) were all Norwegian
There's also been many other explorers before and after them
Ok it's not very "wow" but we have the world's largest kicksled
And the next to largest one
I wouldn't be surprised if we have the third largest too
>We introduced the Japanese to the salmon
What did the salmon think of the Japanese, after you introduced them
I think our super-long coastline and the insane number of islands of islands (both in the top three in the world) deserves a mention too
It's a thing that I don't think many foreigners are aware of
>Largest producer of high quality boar semen
>Largest producer of insulin (pretty good quality, too)
I see a connection here that I don't really like

Fun fact: it is illegal to wear armour in the british parliament
Here's some other fun facts about british laws:
- It is illegal to carry a plank along a pavement
- It is illegal to fire a cannon within 300 yards of a dwelling house
- It is illegal to beat or shake any carpet or rug in any street, however beating or shaking a doormat is allowed before 8 am
Some other things covered by this law also includes erecting a washing line across the street, slaughtering cattle in the streets, singing profane or obscene songs or ballads in the street and wilfully and wantonly disturbing people by ringing their doorbells or knocking at their doors
- It is illegal to handle salmon in suspicious circumstances

The salmon loved them
They've had a very special, but raw relationship over the last couple of decades :)
You can see the market value of the fund [here]
The peace prize has it's own committee made up of Norwegian people, it's decided in Norway and given to the winner in Norway, but yes, it has the name of a swede on it
There is a regulation saying that being buried in a coffin is illegal, and therefore Svalbard has a policy that everyone who are dying has to be sent to mainland Norway beforehand (probably because it would be insanely expensive to send them there while they're dead)
It is only permitted to be buried there after being cremated

I'll take a 50/50, you were right on the Svalbard thing and I was about the Peace Prize :p
It might be funny, it's also the way you should argue with people
Give and take, you win some and you loose some
The world is made up of compromises :)
Celeriac root, sunchoke, swede (rutabaga), red beet

I can't recall soccer ever turning violent up here
Or any other sport for that matter
Greeks are extremely passionate about basketball
So that
Ah, so the sport that we just win a lot of the times ;)
And that's not a lot
I guess France is shit at football then
We'd probably sit there quietly at the end of the table drinking schnapps out of a fancy little shot glass all night
Eventually we'd burp, stand up, and just leave
Speaking for Norway and Iceland
The rich guy who tries to hide it while talking as little as possible
If it's a *free* party, with buffet, we're not behaving quietly
Actually if the party is hosted abroad, the beer is probably so cheap anyway, so we'll behave like bafoons

That Breivik (far-right terrorist) will only spend 21 years in prison because we have a prison system that treat prisoners as princesses
This is typically said by Americans in favor of the death penalty on many different subs
Apparently we've committed genocide against the Sami minority
You often see these comments on youtube videos and stuff too
You can blame foreign sensationalist media for this
They decided to run this dishonest narrative from day one because they knew it would generate clicks
"MASS MURDERER ONLY GETS 21 YEARS IN JAIL
&#x200B;
And people obviously took the bait because they don't care enough to do two minutes of googling
The thing is
as a pure matter of fact, criminals *are* treated better here than a lot of other places
That's because a lot of other places think you can improve people by treating them like shit or murdering them - the former is obviously wrong to anyone with half a brain stem, the latter is only true to a disappearingly small proportion of **human beings** no matter what they've done
Norwegian approach to prisoners is rehabilitation, not medieval-ass retribution
Yes
And five years more after that and so on
Both have changed

There are probably some bigger ones, although the first one that came to mind was Therese Johaug's doping case
One of the top 2 female cross country ski athletes testing positive for doping, she won the world cup as the best athlete the season before
It was a pretty big case, although a little toned down because of disagreement of whether she actually did it on purpose or not
Wasnt that the woman who made that saxobeat song
Good times
As far as I remember very few people actually thought she did it on purpose
Wasn’t the banned substance just an ingredient in a face lotion she was using or something
And I’d say the Giske thing was our biggest recent celebrity scandal
Or perhaps the various escapades of Petter Northug
The recent Bertheussen-scandal is quite special
In november 2018 a theater called Blackbox had a play where they where “exploring the lifes of people on the far right”. In the background they had some videos of some houses, and the actors where pretending like they were laying in the bushes of the garden and observing the lives of the house owners
It wasn’t mentioned in the play, but the houses actually belonged to the minister of justice(Mikkel Wara) and some other prominent figures in the far right party (which are quite moderate compared to european far right parites)
The wife of the minister of justice is called Laila Bertheussen
She was completely unknown before the following incidents
She went to the theater and was angry with them
She was kicked out of the theater for recording the play with her phone
Several on the right was angry with the theater and claimed their play created a dangerous atmosphere for politicians
December: Someone tried set  Wara’s car on fire
A swastika was tagget on it
And “racist” was tagget on the house
January: Two politicians (far  right party) received threatening letters which called them racists
At some point the police started to have 24-hour protection of the house
March: The police’s bomb squad investigated some suspicious letter delivered to Wara
March: Wara’s car was burning at night
March The police indicts Bertheussen for doing all of the things herself
The whole time she claimed that the theater had motivated some radical lefty to attack her and other people on the right
She was sentenced to 1 year and 8 months and was found guilty at disturbing the government institutions with threatening letters and fake attacks
Had to Google a bit
Is it like "funny wanker", half compliment, half insult
Northug's cases is also a good shout, I considered saying that
Although I feel Johaug and to a degree Sundby's doping cases has had somewhat large consequences on how foreign people and media sees our skiers
I also doubt Johaug actually doped deliberately to cheat but that scandal has heavily tarnished the reputation of Norwegian skiers
The view I feel like has shifted from them being considered clean and pro fair play to now every other succesful Norwegian skier being accused for doping or asthma, without any proof or backing really but based on those two cases
Not in Norway that is but by foreigners, especially Swedes and Finns seem to bring it up every time I've noticed
Bohemian Rhapsody
When I was a kid I didn't understand a single thing
Never really liked music, lol
I find it catchy thoe
Same goes for german songs, I find some of them catchy, but when I learnt what they mean I didn't really bother
You know there are many rap and hip hop artists with non disgusting lyrics right
No, but I did go to something we called summer camp or whatever which lasted for a week and we played volleyball, handball, that kinda thing
But only for 6-7 hours a day, 5 days
We dont go in the summer, we go in winter
If they want
I know of a few camps which are overnight, but yes, it’s like you said, going to camp and doing outdoor activities
just admit it mate you did nazi that one coming HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I feel you, though :/
Dentist are the expensive ones in Norway, compared to anything else
That said i probably should go to them
I have not been to a dentist since i was 19, thats 11 years ago
I got a checkup and drilled 2 itsy bitsy tiny holes when i was in the army, that was when i was 22, so 8 years ago
&#x200B;
Anyway, i dont know but i have had no issues with my teeth apart from those two tiny holes, i have no problems either, can't feel any discomfort or such
However, i do have some dental tartar so while my teeth might be fine and dandy, my gums could probably do with some caring
Once a year, not sure what's the average
I always go during July, except last year
It was pushed back because of Corona so I didn't get to go before September
Yearly is the standard, though some people don't go every year, or at all
1 or 2 times pr year depending on if I have any problems or not
Once a year
I go to the best dentist, and he says it's enough
I don't know if there are dental hygienists in Norway, I've never heard of them
Same
Haven’t seen one in
five years
And before that it was seven years between visits I think
My dentist is old-school cool and extremely relaxed lol
He told me to come back when I felt like I needed it
My teeth feel good, no pain anywhere, they work perfectly and as they’re supposed to
I went more frequently when I had my braces, of course, but I’ve never had any cavities or things that needed fixing, except for the extreme tooth/jaw misalignment
Because they can’t afford, that’s the reality in “the world’s richest and best country”.
Never heard of this dental hygienist
We have dentist, and "kjeveortoped". One does rutine checkups and minor things, the other is responsible for braces and more advanced stuff
Tannpleier is the Norwegian equivalent, and for more serious check-ups the tannlege does the work
You can also be sent to an oralkirurg for serious stuff
People here often check when advised by the dentist
I have been advised to check every 2 years, and I do
Can't remember the last time I had a hole though
The visits usually consist of some cleaning and xrays
I’m aware, I have discussed this with said dentist
I’m sure I will need more frequent visits in the future, as I get older
As of now, as long as no one wants to spend money on my teeth on my behalf, it’s not happening
I can barely put food on the table, so as long as my teeth have no opinions, and teeth aren’t a part of your health (according to our universal healthcare system), they will have to be
Ive never been to a tannpleier, unless they offer this service at the tannlege as well
It's usually a tannpleier that performs the routine check-ups and takes the xray
Might be different where you live
Poverty is a thing in many countries
At the moment, I am studying and my only “income” is the student loan
Due to Covid I am out of work, but since I’m a student I do not receive any additional support from the government - even if I’ve been working and paying taxes for many many years
Yeah, I live in a smaller town
But what I would call tannlege does these things
Nothing at all really
Except for a few years in the Viking era we hardly had much influence on the rest of the world
Hence my lack of expectation that schools in other nations teach about it
That the whole northern part of Norway was completely razed to the ground by the retreating German forces at the end of WW2 and all the civilian population was forcefully evacuated in an effort to halt the liberation of northern Norway by the Soviet Union
The Soviet troops in Norway was voluntarily withdrawn and the last soldiers left Norway on the 25th of September, 1945
Winter War
May only be because we sent you some volunteer troops
Norway: Not openly hostile, but not super friendly either
It's easier if you come from other European countries, USA, Australia and New Zealand
But still not super easy
If you are used to easily make friends you might get a bit of a culture shock coming here
But, it's easier for someone who is lets say 25, rather than 35
The older we get the more set we are in our social circle
It very much depends on several factors, especially where you settle and who you meet
You can be easier welcomed in some places and among some people than others in general
Broadly speaking I feel Norwegians in general are pretty much accepting to everyone, but there’s also still a lot of sentiment around against people from some parts of the world
Whether someone manage to “adapt” to the Norwegian society, fit in and integrate also much depends on where you are, but some nationalities seem to manage it easier than others
Expats don’t try to learn Danish no matter how long they still and expect everyone to speak English for them
Immigrants/Refugees have some issues, but the 2nd generation integrates decently
I don't agree at all
A lot of people are sceptic, but I think at least people in the large cities is pretty open minded
My own experience as an American who has lived in Norway for decades is that Americans moving abroad tend to fall into one of two groups
One group is charmed and excited by everything
It's all new
And exciting
And we should do things like this back home
They will have some bad days, start seeing the problems, get the edges knocked off them, and most of the time will end up with a decently balanced attitude
They appreciate some of the differences, grumble about the others, and mostly end up enjoying their new lives most of the time
The second group arrives expecting everything to be worse, and therefore everything is
They generally end up stuck in that position forever, or until they move back to the States, whichever comes first
I don't know that the distribution is 50/50 or even close to it, but then, I haven't been keeping records or anything
Yeah I think you are right
But even if we are friendly, it's not necessarily easy to befriend us
But, the younger you are the easier it is
Nobody said they couldn't, but it is more likely for some than others
I never bathe, but I shower 3-4 times a week
Daily showers really aren't necessary (or great for your skin) as far north as I am
I don't think I've had a bath in at least 4 years
I've never regularly taken a bath
However I shower, normally, once a day (but only wash my hair every other day at most)
You have a shower in the morning
And if you go to the gym or exercise in the afternoon, you shower afterwards
And if it is a really hot summer's day, you might have a shower just to cool off
Price of electricity or hot water is not a factor since it is cheap
You shower as much as you want
In winter, people probably shower less
Because sub zero temperatures means the air is dry (humidity is frozen)
And air inside a house is dry because of heating
Showering also removes a isolating oily layer on your skin, so going out in really cold weather after showering is cold
Better to shower before going to bed to let your skin develop a bit of oily skin to protect from the cold
If you are on holiday in a cabin in winter and hot water is scarce, you do not shower every day
I remember my first trip to Denmark
I was staying at someone's house, and they asked me if I wanted to take a bath
They meant a shower
Not sure if its only that part of Denmark they say bath for a shower
That being said, most people in Norway take a shower every morning
In my house we also have a bathtub, so I like taking a bath now and again
Up here in the North, once a day is a bit excessive in general
In warmer climates it's necessary
Who wants to go to sleep with wet hair just to wake up with a birdsnest as todays hairstyle
Or you'll have to take time as you wake up to wet your hair, comb it and dry it again, after already having used time the night before to shower
So much easier to just pop in the shower as you wake up in the morning
Haha well I only shower about 3 times a week in the winter, 4 maybe 5 when summer is the hottest
If you get dirty and sweaty after a day, it may be because you shower too much, which is not good for your skin or hair in the long run
No, I just use a knife, same one I'd use for cutting up vegetables
Pizza slicer is definitely the norm, but I have a pizza scissor (as in specifically meant for cutting a pizza) and it is so much better than a slicer
Can confirm
Scissors are way easier when gutting fish, cutting fins, and basically preparing fish
I do use a sharp thin filleting knife if I want to cut the fish from the bone or draw of the skin, but for everything else a scissor is better than a knife
Oslo, everybody loves to hate oslo, they just take everything from all the other citys
Northern and eastern Norway also make fun of eachother, but I feel like it's slightly more okey that northerners make fun of them, since it wasent so far ago that notherners were heavely discriminated and looked down upon
But yeah, people from Oslo get everything there, even with offices being moved thete,  but the worst thing is that they arr to daft to understand all the other people are pissed at them
Northerners
The general joke is that they're all potty-mouthed red neck alcoholics
My part of the country (West) is known for being unintelligible bunch of farmers, juxtapositioned with being home to two of the major oil cities in the country
Oslo has a typical capital city reputation
Edit: I forgot to add, the south being fanatical Christians
Everyone makes jokes about Bergen
They have a funny dialect
Speaking with that dialect is comedy gold when you're 6
The name sounds like it's a slum
That is what I imagine when I hear that name
My teacher(from the north) had a story he told in class
When he was younger he went to university somewhere in the southern parts
Many people asked him stupid questions like "do you have stores up there" and "do you have a pet polar bear".
I thought everyone loved to hate Bergen, but maybe that's just here in the east
From what I know we like to make fun of Oslo and Bergen mostly
I thought we were the most laughed at tbh, for being full of rånere and all the Alabama type jokes
Still get thos questions though, but I think it's more to make fun now
My sister went a year to school down in eastern norway and apparently she fucked reindeer because she was northern norwegian according to her classmates
Just remember that it wasent until like the 90's or something that it got illegal to descriminate people on the rental market, so a common thing that you would see in the ads was no norhern norwegians
In the 70's they actually had to make student apartments for northern norwegian students because they had such a hard time finding a apartment
There is a long history of discrimination, and if you want a summarizing of that history, told in a very comedic way I would recomend you to read "Støttebok for søringer i Nord-Norge". It's a humoristic view on this
Do you mean northern norway, I am really confused now
Yeah I've heard of Slough before
Mainly by watching ISP play Cities Dkylines and name shitty things 'Slough'.
Nah, Oslo people like to make fun of Bergen, Drammen, and Østfold
Bergen for constant rain and for thinking they're more important than they are
Drammen for being a drab industrial/port town
And Østfold for being full of rånere, inbred, and kind of slow
Not saying that any of these are *true*, by the way, except for Bergen being rainy
(Drammen's a rather pleasant little city
) That's just what the jokes are about
Thanks for explaining that way better than I did
Yeah, I have heard some of them, I think drammen is a beutiful town and I enjoy visiting, but I only have bad experience with people from Drammen
Though, this was in my youth, so I am not going to judge in general
I know what Østfold is known for, it reaches up here north to, but I dunno, it seems like a harry place to me, with some neo nazis, that is probobly mostly from sweeden
I don't really like the culture in Bergen, probobly because they act like northern norwegians but more loud and too confident, I'm not sure if they take themself to seriusly, which is probobly a pluss if they don't.
Now I have seen several times people from Oslo getting buthurt over out jokes on them, propobly because they take themselfs to seriusly
But I was talking in a more general term
My fiance is from Larvik, and I have friends all around eastern Norway, so I know everybody who don't live in Oslo makes fun of Oslo
But in general from eastern Norway I have heard to many bad jokes about northern Norway, and alot of them make fun of it
It's not that I can't see the humor in it, but their not even creative, so it just get bothersome some times
It gets really old really fast when the only thing you hear is if you live in caves
Not a movie thing, but there's a town called Hell that has a Hollywood sign
You forget about Hællæwood
No, I just didn't know about it (if this isn't a joke)
It's a real joke name at least
It's the name Fredrikstad takes every time there is a movie premier there
Like the world premier of the new karate kid movie
- Oslo (630 000)
- Bergen (269 000)
- Trondheim (180 000)
Oslo is the closest thing to a proper international city
If you include the areas around it, the total population is closer to 1 million
The other cities just feels like large small cities (if that makes sense
Trondheim has the largest university and Bergen has a lot of mountains and nature around it
There's also a lot of shipping and harbours there
Oslo = more international
considered uppity and posh and big by others
good infrastructure/transport considering it's a big city
they also get to drive faster on roads compared to the rest of us, i guess because they live next to Sweden
huge variety of services, this is one of the cities where new concepts come first
weather is medium, they seem to have all the seasons
shit beer =P all foreigners sound like they are from Oslo since all the learning mediums use that dialect
Bergen = more rough around the edges
surrounded by nature/mountains so lots of hikers
confusing infrastructure and annoyed about increasing toll stations, transport is also very bleh
very small selection of stores and restaurants, we seem to run on monopolies
rains a LOT
we don't get all the seasons, we get seasons combined with monsoon
best beer (edit
because we need it) =D
Stavanger = sunny city, has sand beaches
decent infrastructure and transport system
they have roads in the middle of their roundabouts so that buses don't have to curve
even they hate the toll stations, but actually did more about it compared to bergen
more variety in stores and restaurants than Bergen tbh
people are imo very friendly and more chill, probably due to them having better weather and more D vitamins
Trondheim = never been there
but known to me as a student city
looks pretty too
> Half of this dude's life seems to be lived at 4 am on Sunday mornings
I need to move to Malmö
There are farms in Oslo
In Maridalen, for instance
You're doing nothing to dissuade me
Because almost everyone gets vaccinated as a kid
Edit: [96% 2 year olds were vaccinated in 2018]
Came here to say his
Personally I don't know any parents at all who have not had their kids vaccinated
They are few and far between
Yep
We haven't had the need to make it mandatory
And I hope it doesn't get to that here
It does
Charlemagne is Karl den store, the English kings named Henry are Henrik, and king Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden is Svenskeknugen
Yes and it confused me so much later on
When we had English class and learned about kings, or on the internet looking for information or reading things/comments
Some times I have viewed some as two individuals, when they really were the same with different name in Norwegian
Same thing with countries as well
I thought "Belarus" and "White Russia" was two different countries
And that Wien and Vienna was two different cities
Hehe
knugen
It's pronounced Nikolaj
I suppose, but my money is on Karl
It's a very old Germanic word, and presumably, name
After 10-12 Danish beers, the language seems less incomprehensible
I think both Liverpool and Glasgow are much nicer cities than they are often portrayed as
I also though Brussels and Milan were pretty nice and a lot less gray than their reputation suggest
Internationally I would add Philadelphia in the USA which I thought was pretty nice even if got its far share of social issues
Croatia is pretty great
Beautiful, with good pizza and seafood
You gave us away to sweden, you
sandbank
I agree
Belgium is one of the nicest countries I've visited
And even better food than Italy and France
And then the Dane said to the Belgian "YOU" are breathtaking
Oh I see, so you were not keeping to the subject of the post
These are probably common everywhere
After-work beer with your coworkers on salary day
I work at a fairly large place and we have an e-mail list for planning each monthly get-together
If you go out of the country, especially on a conference or something else work-related (but usually just vacation too), you have to bring back some candy for the office
Usually bought at the airport tax free store
You usually don't get anything nice when you start working somewhere, but when you quit there's cake and a gift and a small party
My manager has started getting flowers for his employees' first day because he thinks it's dumb that we only celebrate when people leave
Breakfast at work is not common
And reading through the comments it makes me realise just how boring we are
When its my birthday I hope no one remembers, and I will definitely not bring a cake
[Når sjelen hentes til helvete] by Dimmu Borgir
Black metal which Norway of course is famous for
Kvelertak is probably the best band with Norwegian lyrics
If you wanna include national elements, their major hit Mjød is about vikings and their golden drink mead
Then there's Rogaland, about their love/hate relationship with their home county
Their 80's inspired 1985 is about an Orwellian future, and Bråtebrann is about when the singer and a friend played with matches
Oh, and the epic Fanden ta dette hull about a murderer whose skeleton ended up in a museum for a hundred years before being laid to rest
Ingenting is a great band too
for Norway it would probably be
Eric Bloodaxe (885-954) literally cut his brothers heads of
Vidkun Quisling (1887-1945) was leader of Norway after the German invasion of Norway and was in 1945 convicted for treason and was the last to get a death penalty in Norway
vidkun quisling
when the germans invaded he took a cab up to a radio station and preformed a coup over the radio, listing his new ministers he had never even asked to be ministers off of a napkin he had hastily scrabbled them down on
also, he actually thought the nazis would let him rule, pretty quickly thry installed a kommisarat
We also had Frederick V. Alcoholic (to the point of injuring himself numerous times), one primary lover (5 children with her) and numerous prostitutes, it's said his sex life took some wild turns and in the end he whipped them until they started to bleed
He was well liked though by the general population afaik
You don't get a name like Bloodaxe for nothing
Same
Castles are dope, would be crazy not to like them
In times of war (and the subsequent aftermath) it was legal to execute treasonous convicts until arount 1970
Huh, we have almost the opposite situation here in Norway
Gendered words are viewed by many feminists as excluding
Even so much that the Norwegian word for Norwegians (Nordmann, or "Northman") are being considered replaced by these groups
There has been talks about giving a more neutral sounding alternative, but no-one has really talked about retiring nordmann
Yes
Things have a tendency to creep over the border
Sweden is horrible when it comes to drugs though and I'm sure it's kept Norway from legalising it earlier
Nope, just different variations of "takk". Tusen takk, mange takk, takk skal du ha
Takk = Thanks
Tusen takk = A thousand thanks
Takk skal du faen meg ha
You can say "takker", as in "takker og bukker".
Hahaha, saw this one in the inbox and didn't understand what the context was
Yes, that's the present tense of the verb "to thank".
I'm pretty sure it applies for all Nordic languages
No, but I am aware of them having a secret atomic bomb-programme
Okay, when did Sweden have such a large air force
Late 80s? So, USSR, USA and UK had larger then
But yeah, we all had large armies
Finland and Sweden weren't in NATO and thus had to defend against USSR on their own in case of an invasion, Gotland had like 8 military bases
Norway also had to hold a large army, because we were only in NATO to get a shield against nukes tbh
We wanted to stay neutral, but after Stalin promised Gerhardsen to not invade any other countries he literary invaded Czechoslovakia a few months later, lol (more a coup thoe)
So, then the red scare exploded in all of Europe
Gerhardsen, the PM and leader of the communists, snitched on many hundreds if not tousands for being pro soviets
And we became one of the founding nstions of NATO
Anyways, so we wanted US protection, not US help
We refused their tbh demand to have military bases on Svalbard, or having long time foreign forces on norwegian soil
Thus we had to hold a large army, 400 000 at the most I believe, excluding reserves, military service was mandatory and many were imprissoned for refusing
Nowadays we have no army to speak off and have given US a military long term base in Norway, to frighten the russians
There are around 300 american troops there ....
So all nordic nations have heavily neglected defenses nowadays tbh
Sweden really want an EU army to not have to spend much money on military
Btw, don't forget my questions at the beginning
My cat
Coffee
Weed
A good book
Laptop
I think this is really just about it, I am a simple creature
Apart from my cat, none of these things are unique to my country/culture
I guess I'm just a child of globalization
I dont own a lot of items that are really essential to me
I'd say the few items that are would be
* Phone (Obvious one)
* Card holder
* Sony noice cancelling headset (Amazing for commuting and flights, had them for a few years now and love them)
* AirPods pro (Bit of a luxury item that I didnt really need but I wanted a pair of wireless airbuds for running and they are very nice and useful, I love everything that doesnt involve a cable)
* Laptop (Need for uni work and just easy to carry around)
* Desktop (I still very much prefer desktops over laptops so this is what I'll use if I'm home)
* Hair dryer (My hair gets weird if I dont dry it using a hair dryer
* \*Electric\* toothbrush (Can't really go back a normal one once having made the switch)
Of the 1000 most common words in the Dano-Norwegian dictionary 15-20% is German in origin, so a lot
Even basic words like "become/remain" is from Middle Low German "blîven" partially replacing the native word in many dialects
Depends a bit on the ideology and dialect though, as some purist movements want to avoid German vocabulary
Nynorsk prefers fewer for example
The wonderful term *prügelknabe*, which means whipping boy
Metaphorically, it means "scapegoat", or "preferred hate object".
"Weltschmertz" is a fine word too
Personally, I use "Scheisse" a lot
Occasionally "verdammt".
Sprachbung, sprachraum, bestilling, kanserleri, Kleiner Vorsterländer, Nazi (does it count
), Panserkampvogn (Panzerkampfwagen), Folkevogn/Volkswagen, Lettland, and many more, as both the languages of course are germanic
>Handy
[Wo ist mein Handy
Ich habe mein Handy verloren
:\(]
Krieg (krig) Bunker Kaputt Besteck (bestikk) Probably a lot more since we are a germanic language, but those are the ones i couls think of right now
Yes, those two
In that order
The effect that German (particularly Low-German) has had on the Scandinavian languages is just astounding
People sometimes compare it to the French influence on English
It's nearly impossible for two Norwegians to have a simple two minute conversation without using a single word of German origin
Agreed; it's not possible to have a two minute conversation without bringing up weltschmerz
But is that something we've loaned from german, or is it just from the same root
The Old Norse word was "verða", which some have preserved
So to "become" you can say both:
bli(ve) - blir - blei - blitt
verte - vert - vart - vorte
Or more weirdly, many have mixed the words:
bli - blir - vart - vorte
That, and also *veldig*, *viss* (if), *kanskje* and *bli*. Without having checked the numbers on this, I'm guessing that the average Norwegian sentence probably contains about one or two German loanwords
We certainly have a lot of common Germanic words, including *hand, hund, boge* and *du*, but additionally, we have a bunch of Low German loanwords that we adopted starting from around the 1300s. This includes a lot of common words, such as *reise, ære, begrave* and *hemmelegheit*. The number of such loanwords is definitely in the hundreds, if not the thousands
You can read more about it here: [
In Norway I believe the pure "verte" form is only found in parts of the west, and a couple archaic places in the east and trøndelag
The mixed system is quite standard in the whole country except south of Oslo and some northern places I think though
You don't need to go far from Oslo before people start saying "du vart".
vaɽ in present tense in Trøndelag is noted, but I think it is extinct except as an subjunctive of sorts
The only infinitive form I've seen from here is actually "vårtå".
It's much more common than it was 10 years ago, and has been pretty normalized
[I have shoulder length hair,] and I tend to get comments from two groups of people
Older men in my family, 50 and above, who asks me when I'm planning to cut my hair
And younger women in my social circles, 20-30, who gives me compliments
One of those groups have a larger sway on my hair style than the other
I would say the fashion at the moment is more long beards
But a man with long hair is not turning heads
It's common enough
I see some from time to time, pretty shure no one care either way
Its just hair, right
Kneler, directly translated to "kneeling" or "the kneeler".
Actually I think mostly just English and the Scandinavian languages use "what" for this kind of questions
I'm always tempted to answer "how do you call xxx" questions with "using a telephone" or some other crap

Is it that one
That we are a part of Sweden
I've actually told an American I met online that I was from Norway and he replied with "Oh, so you're Swedish
He didn't even mean it as a joke
He was deadass serious
I wonder how many times I’ve heard that I live in Sweden
And that Oslo is a town in Sweden
Did you ask if he was Canadian or maybe Bolivian
It’s more like that Danish and Swedish are that close to Norwegian that we understand them the same way we understand dialects of our own language
Swedish btw is pretty different in many ways, with many influences of German
Some dialects of all three languages can be hard anyway to understand though
Nope but I definitely should have
Missed opportunity right there
We shot the largest traitor of the war, Vidkun Quisling
The rest were probably thrown in jail for a long time or life time
Here, those women who actually married Germans lost their citizenship
Shameful
There were quite a few young women who married their German sweethearts after the war, even knowing the consequences
I've read a few interviews with the few surviving women - they say they do not regret marrying the love of their life, but very much regret the toll it took on their families, and the hassle of having to apply specially for the kids to visit their maternal grandparents and such
And these were not actual collaborators or anything
Those were tried for their crimes
These were just young women who had fallen in love with equally young men, particularly towards the end of the war, when a lot of young men were drafted and sent abroad
Terrified kids who didn't particularly want to be in the war, but who were given no choice and luckily made friends when they were stationed in Norway
It was bound to happen
Not sure on the difference between castle and fortress but nevertheless here are my visits
Fredriksten Fortress in Halden, Norway (my ancestors used to live there)

Edinburgh Castle

Akershus Fortress in Oslo, Norway
That's all I can think of at the moment
I work freelance from home, so freedom, poverty and most importantly, freedom
Phone (with subscription), Internet at home, discounted lunch, free use of some sports equipment
Obviously laptops and stuff as well, though they aren't *really* mine
Used to have free gym, general health care checkups + some other stuff as well, but got cut a few years ago to save money
- mobile phone with contract
- gym membership
- yearly check health check up
- 2 hours (paid) off work every day to breast feed
In addition to what every worker gets:
- 5 weeks paid vacation (plus 10-12 public holidays a year)
- up to 12 months paid parent leave
- 10 days paid sick leave to stay at home with a sick child
- 12 days paid sick leave for myself (no note from the doctor is needed)
- up to 24 months paid sick leave in case of long term illness (note from the doctor needed)
- protection from being fired for just any reason
* company-owned cell phone
* company pays for internet access
* flexible hours, core hours are 9-2:30
* 1
5 hours a week for exercise during work hours
* 7 hour work day during summer (7
75 during winter so it averages out to 7
* one extra week of vacation, for a total of 5 weeks (4 weeks are guaranteed by law but many have a fifth week)
* 8 sick days in a row for a total of up to 24 sick days total in a year, before needing a doctor's note (also a common benefit here)
Probably some more minor stuff I'm forgetting
Of course there's also a lot that I get from the government and not the workplace per se, like the 5 month paternity leave I'm currently enjoying,
It's different here then
Free time is free time, you're not expected to do work when off the clock
That said, we do have to tax benefits like this, it's not 100% free
Back when I had a boss, I wouldn't have answered the phone at all if he called me in my free time
Don't underestimate being able to use the internet and read books when its not busy
Sounds like the perfect job to me
By the way, do you have paid sick leave in Bulgaria
Flexible hours is the best benefit
Can also be a curse
It kind of depends
Do you have paid sick leave
Dont you have paid sick leave
Dont worry, you have all the freedoms and guns

I recently looked into how many US citizens have a real choice when it comes to health insurance
The number turns out to be **really** low
Since many either cant afford insurance, or they are under-insured (cheap insurance but they then cant afford the out of pocket cost), or they have medicaid, or they have mediare and cant afford extra insurance on top of that (even if experts recommend all to get it), or they re stuck in a job that only offer one kind of health insurance
So its surprising that so many cling to the notion that there is actual choice for most people
But you seem to be one of them, and I am genuinely happy for you
> it’s really hard for me to find ways to spend my time of I take all five weeks vacation in a year
Americans are the weirdest people
How can you not know how to just relax for a few weeks
Yes
Well, yes sorta
It does happen that I take the occasional work call or message etc
But overall, my colleagues would be hesistant to call after hours or if they know I have the day off
I would be perfectly within reason to tell them to call me about it tomorrow if it's not aomething very urgent
We're not inflexible, but we value the work/life balance
As for personal stuff at work, everyone is fine with you doing the occasional call etc while at work
Now, this might be different in other workplaces, as I've worked at a call center when I was younger, and that stuff was hell on earth compared to the public sector job I have now
I'm not saying I procrastinate all day, but nobody would bat an eye if I took 10minute longer break
So, it differs a bit between sectors
I don't have a spouse, but my gf never called me during work hours, so it wasn't really an issue
If she had called me during work hours, I'd know that it was some really serious shit, so yeah, I would answer
But that's the difference between your boss and your gf
If your gf/spouse has an emergency, it takes precedence over anything job related, but not vice versa
Then again, my boss would never call me in my free time anyway, because he understood the difference between work hours and free time, as all bosses should
Not the same person - but yeah, now that I think about it, free time is holy but work hours aren't.
Brilliant
It can be tempting to leave early and catch up later in the week
Later in the week you wish you hadn't left early the previous days
But yes - the advantages do outnumber the disadvantages
> They are forced to do it
And that is how it needs to be
If it wasn't forced Europe would end up like USA - where low paid jobs would have no benefits at all

Yeah I understand why you would work so hard then
I've heard US student loans are very high
Are these plants actually in the dictionary as words
I looked them up in Norwegian and yes, they are names for species, but they are not recognised as words in ‘officially’.
Ooooops, I must’ve mispelled it, as that is what I consider the actual dictionary

Random drunk well-coordinated choral outbursts are a plague in the bars and pubs of Reykjavík
Not really no
I would say it's more common for drunk people to travel by taxi
I've been riding the bus home drunk many a time, and I'd say 40-50% of the times there have been allsang
Then I'm obviously either taking the bus at the wrong times, OR I live in the wrong town
If Icelandic counts, it's not intelligible spoken, but I can just about get the gist of written Icelandic if I really try
Faroese is hard, but you can kinda read and understand them if they talk slowly about simple things
But once they get going about stuff they have other words for it's impossible
Icelandic is impossible besides a few words here and there
American Norwegian is fun
You have those that seem to remember it or re-learn it through writing and have kinda eastern dialects with american influence
And then you have those who kept on talking their old dialects, with a fun mix of
American R, retroflexes, cases and american vocabulary like "car" and "farm".
Yes, Icelandic is barely understandable
The Kvens that went north to current Norway back in the day perhaps
Aren't you guys taught Danish though
We only briefly touched on Old Norse in school, and never Icelandic
That's not a spoken language though
I'm sure that "singing" is very dialect dependent
I can think of several dialects which nobody would ever think of as "singing". I can understand it for standard eastern Norwegian though
Neither of them are spoken
They are both strictly written languages
Spoken Norwegian is hundreds of different dialects
Mostly the latter
Bokmål is not that far from certain dialects in and near Oslo (and parts of Finnmark), and Nynorsk is quite similar to dialects found in fjords north of Bergen
That being said, grammar in local dialects can differ a bit from either of the two written standards
As for use, about 90% have Bokmål as their written standard, while ~10% use Nynorsk
All written material should be in either of those, but lots of Norwegians are terrible at grammar and spelling, so there's quite a few people (especially online) who write a bastardized mix of one of the written standards and their dialect, or just go "fuck it" and write their dialect
If you visit /r/norge on a regular day, I'd say about 20% of the posts there are either bad Norwegian or their own interpretation of the language (aka their dialect in writing)
Edit: 20% is probably more correct
Probably 17th May 1814 when we got our constitution and became independent for the first time in over 400 years (until a few weeks later when Sweden started a war against us and forced us into a union, but we were still considered our own nation in the union because of the constitution)
The day is still our most celebrated holiday, with huge parades, parties, national costumes and lots of flag-waving
It might have been being under the rule of Denmark and Sweden for so long
It made Norwegians cling to their national identity much more than what I think we would have done if we were independent the whole time
[Just look at how we dress on our constitution day while carrying around a flag each
] None of the other Nordic countries do this
**Edit:** Since OP mentioned WW2
During the war it was illegal to celebrate constitution day
Even in Sweden Norwegians were not allowed to celebrate
This because Swedish authorities were afraid that Swedes would join the parade (Stockholm) and that it would be viewed as demonstrations by Germany
[Source] So when we were finally free again and were allowed to do parades carrying our flag it meant more to us than ever before
Some info on the Swedish-Norwegian Union:
It was only a 'personal union' where Norway and Sweden had a common King and a common foreign policy (aka
completely run by the Swedes)
For all other intents and purposes we where separate countries
In contrast,  Norway was governed from Copenhagen (by Norwegians and Danes) before 1814
Fårikål, I just can't stand it
But the way the smell linger in the house after you make it is the worst part
Pinnekjøtt
Most popular Christmas dish here
It’s just super salty dry meat
Served with boiled potatoes and a light salty sauces (usually mostly jus from the meat) the whole meal is just a mixture of salty, bland, and dry

Fram and Kon-Tiki museums are cool, and if you're into viking-things then the Viking ship museum is a good one as well (but it's small and packed with tourists)
I can't speak for other cities than Oslo though
As someone who comes from Drøbak, I would like to add in Oscarsborg fortress as well
We don’t have it at all
Although we have mcdonalds, burger kings, starbucks, a few dominos
We have quite the amount of pizza shops actually, although dominos is at the bottom of that list
What I am most surprised about is that we don’t have really any place that serves tacos
We love our tacos here and the only thing I can remember is tacopedia, which went bankrupt after a short while
Doesn't exist, which is a shame, because indojt mind a bit of fried chicken once in a while
But I probably only think that because we don't have it as an option
You got Los Tacos rolling out a few joints in Oslo lately, other than that there are some good “independent” ones around, but no country covering chains as I know
In Oslo there's a bunch of independent taco/Mexican restaurants that do well, but as you say, no taco fast food chain
Wait you guys have Taco Bell and Pizza Hut
I am jealous
In Norway the only international fast food chains we have is McDonalds, Burgerking, Dominos and Max
No, they are still around
They were bought up
Yes, to some degree
The basics are seen as fundamental
We learn some stuff in primary school and middle school (I think it was one year each)
It’s not common to eat at resultants for ordinary meals, of course we might do it sometime, but normally we eat at home, so being able to make some food for yourself that is going to sustain you is very important
However I can’t really make things totally from scratch, because I don’t bother
What I make is often just a little mixing and heating needed, like pasta, meat balls, soup and more
We learn it in school so yes, I would say it is a fundimental skill
> Even my grandma has observed this and throwing a tantrum from time to time "how lazy the women the women these days have gotten, they don't even know how to cook".
Let me guess, your grandma was a stay at home mom
Yes
What Sweden and Denmark says
That's impressive
Denmark definitely, and also Iceland to a slightly lesser degree
Denmark, Iceland, and the UK
You ARE our neighbouer
At my local training senter it says its 113 km over the sea to Denmark :)
I was in latvia on vacation a couple of years ago
Very beautiful :)
I mean, it's only because Denmark are so close to us, you're like way out in the ocean
Also having so few people kinda means most Norwegians have barely ever met a person from Iceland, whilst there are many Danes here and we often go there ourselves
I swear we like you just as much as the rest though, it's just we don't get to interact as often sadly :D
In Oslo you got different opportunities in terms of both more social life, more places to meet people, a pretty good restaurant scene, many different shops, cultural venues you don’t find anything like elsewhere in Norway and a lot of different jobs
Which is the capital city, though
Jerusalem or Tel Aviv
OK, thanks
So how does J differ from other significant cities
That's an interesting read
Thanks
No, not a thing at all
We have the «normal» lottery, but nothing special around Christmas og New Year
Poland: Cheap as hell
Everything cost like 1/3 of what the equivalent would be at home
I used to travel with my family a lot more than I do now, mostly because of time restraints for my father, so I don't remember everything too well, but here goes anyway:
Norway (I'm form here, but still feel like a tourist when I travel north and east): Mountains and the variety of museums in Oslo
Sweden: Only ever been to the airport in Stockholm (i think), but it was nice I guess
Denmark: Loads of theme parks like legoland, lalandia and fårup to name a few
Used to travel here almost twice a year at one point
Germany: Don't remember much other than Tropical Island and a holocaust museum i visited in 2015, but I have been there before that seeing the countryside
The Netherlands: Nice countryside, but it was to long ago to remember properly
France: Been there twice, first time I saw Omaha beach and Paris, second time I visited Nice and Antibes
Would have liked to these areas again now that I'm older and can appreciate and understand these attractions much better
Poland: Seeing the death camps there was quite an experience, would do again to explore more of the holocaust
Also got to see the castle and old town in Krakow as well as the salt mines outside the city
10/10 would do again
Czechia: Prague is a beautiful city, definitely want to visit again
Also wouldn't mind tasting some beer now that I'm old enough
Hungary: What I remember is nice bridges and a castle in the middle of the city
I will definitely be visiting again to explore the culture
Italy: Visited Rome once
Very nice, never realized how massive some of the old roman buildings were until i visited
Also never realized how beautiful (or small) the churches there are
I'm used to medium to bid sized protestant churches in Norway that are no way near as pretty
GB: London and Brighton were really nice
Got to see Stonehenge as well, and once again the scale surprised me
The British museum and imperial war museum where absolutely amazing to
Spain: Barcelona is an incredibly pretty city
Got to see the lasagrada familia (I definitively misspelled that, but oh well) and  Gaudí's home
The funniest part for me was that everyone was wearing winter coats while me and my family were sporting shorts and t-shirts (it was 15 degrees btw, aka: not cold) and swimming at the beach with people literally looking as we were the only ones doing it
> I got cute with the flags
Just an added detail, isn't it nice
It was very nice, it really made the post for me
Well done
We had [this thing] a couple years ago
Also [this thing] were money from the famous [NOKAS robbery] was said to be used
That's crazy, is there a book or some lengthy english articles on that
What if I told you Scandinavian police just do a piss poor job at busting higher up drug dealers
Except you know if they are idiots that shoot each other in the streets
What part of your country do you believe would be most likely to secede and why
I don't think there's any region even close to having anything resembling an independence movement, closest thing would maybe be Bergen though, they have a saying that goes "I'm not from Norway, I'm from Bergen"
Norway is very unified luckily
The chances of a part of the country breaking away is so small it's barely worth mentioning
People often joke about Bergen but it's nothing more than a joke
If I had to say somewhere it would be the Sami, although that would be difficult since nowadays they're a minority in almost every single municipality
The Sami have never wanted independence, although they have some autonomy in that they have their own Sami parliament
I guess if we manage to piss them off really hard for some reason that is the only way something like that could potentially happen in the future
But again I doubt it
They're likely much better off as a part of Norway than ever seceding
There are basically none independence movements though there is a joke about the city of Bergen going independent
But if I would have to pick one it would probably be a state for the Sàmi people though as far as I know there is no engagement for that
[Obligatory Berxit-ad] Really wished there was an English version or at least English subtitles because this ad is sooo good
I think Northern Norway is more likely to than Bergen, they've been dissatisfied with being governed from Oslo for years
It's amazing to me how the place names on the isles still are basically norwegian with strange spelling
I don't think we'd last too long as an independent state
I've never in my life seen a stray dog in Norway
I remember I was very surprised the first time I was in Turkey and saw a stray dog, and *so many* stray cats
Stray dogs are not a thing in Norway
Sometimes dogs run off, and occasionally there’s that one asshole that dumps their animal, but we don’t have a climate where stray dogs survive
They are either discovered quick, and caught, or they simply don’t survive
We do have stray cats
Very very few of them, but they exist
Cats run off, people are not as good at fixing them
They breed, have kittens, etc
That being said, stray cats are not *common* - and animal welfare organisations are aware of most areas with “colonisations”. Huge efforts are taken to capture these cats, fix them and re-home them
My experience is that stray cats are more common in very rural areas, but overall, not a problem in Norway
Can confirm, there are probably close to zero stray dogs in Norway
Cats, maybe, but probably very few
They are in Sweden
A small amount escaped in the seventies, now there's a few hundred thousand
Migrating to Norway too
We have a few cat colonies in my area, people here don't really care about preventing kittens
I hadn't heard about stray cat colonies until I moved here, where I grew up they were usually "dealt with" at first stray litter
Here I guess people think the cold in the winter will kill them anyway, so they don't care
I sell a lot of pens
It seems to be about 50/50 black or blue
I prefer blue
My husband prefers black
I would use either black or blue, whatever pen I find works
I prefer black
My handwriting is so shit that I try to limit all other factors that could lead to less readbility
Blue ink being one of them
Not common here either, at least not when I was a kid and probably still not
The only time another parent might join would be if they were friends of the host family or if a kid for different reasons needed their parent to be with them
But these are exceptions
I also feel like the parents at birthday parties on American tv are more visible/present when the kids are a bit older and don’t need the parents to be in the room
Not sure if it’s just tv or reality over there
I have a bonus question: is it common in other countries to have one “kid birthday” with friends as described in this post and then another “adult birthday”/“family birthday” with family
I never went to a kid's party where parents stayed longer than just dropping off the town kids
I stayed at the party ones, when by daugther was 3 years old
All the parents drank coffee while the host parents played with the kids
That is the only time though
All the rest of the birthdays we dropped the kids off and picked them up again
So I would say it might happen when the kids are 3 or younger
After that not so common
When the kids are young the parents would usually stay there with them but as the kids get older the parents would just deliver and return them
Only the kids
Let's say the party starts at 6 and ends at 8
Parents will drop off their kids at their friends party and pick them up when a party ends
One year, almost no family members came the same day, so in total with family parties and a friends birthday party I had 4 or 5 birthday parties in the span of 3 weeks
Tell me about it
i hosted my little brothers 6th birthday because my parents were going through some stuff and couldn't do it themselves
20+ 6 year olds running around the house high on sugar
So not a birthday, but a birthweek
Yes, in Norway we are commiting an entire chapter in the norwegian subject about different dialects, social lects (if thats a word), geolects and language differences between countries in Scandinavia
We literally had a hour in school where we learned about the different ways to say letters, like open or closed mouths, or where the tongue is placed when you say the letter L.
And we are also learning about how norwegian was earlier
My group analysed the differences between Nynorsk and Bokmål (our 2 different written languages), and some friends analysed the Norse, Old Norwegian and our language today
Yes
First of all we have two ways of writing Norwegian
And the dialects
oh boy don’t get me started
I remember we had to listen to a tape and mark on the map where the dialect was from
I failed big time
Man i do not want to remember that part, Analyzing dialects, a doll house and karen
Absolutely awful, and there's so many of them, we even have two different written forms
To illustrate my point just compare the next to sentences
Jeg går i a jeg og
Æ e i a æ å
Those say exactly the same
Edit: Translated it is “Im also in class A”
One of our teachers even went further and demanded that we read old norse and Icelandic, as if learning Swedish and danish too wasn't shitty enough
It's part of school for everyone
Norwegian has a lot of varied dialects and no standard dialect so they're an important part of people's identities
> Probably just because we don't have strong dialects (except elfdalian
That's not true
Sweden has stronger and more interesting dialects  than in Norway, just look at Västerbotten, Skåne, Värmland, Gotland, the other Dalmål around Elfdalian, etc
Problem is they seem to be dying out and replaced with a standard language because they have been suppressed much more
>  Analyzing dialects, ~~a doll house and karen~~.
> One of our teachers even went further and demanded that we read old norse and Icelandic
That's the fun part of Norwegian class though
To add alot of childrens shows use a variety of dialects so you are exposed to them at a young age
> As for elfdalian, there is a very strong argument to be made that it's a separate language as well although much closer to Swedish than Sami of course
I don't get why everyone only speaks of Elfdalian when there are plenty of Dalmål very similar to Elfdalian
Are they also languages or not
Yeah, it wasn’t the worst
But when the teacher just wrote that into the termtest none were happy, and she was disappointed that no one got it right
It’s lovely to work with but horrendous to do without proper knowledge
People tend to understand most, if not all the dialects
Some small dialects that is not heard ofte might be harder but its rare
> The thing about Swedish dialects though is that in many cases, the only difference between one dialect and another is the pronunciation
Of course there are some dialects like elfdalian which differs a lot from Rikssvenska (RP Swedish) with both vocabulary and pronunciation, but they're definitely in the minority
This is the difference between genuine dialects and newer accents
Traditional dialects had a lot more differences, while newer ones are just standard Swedish with an accent
On my trips to study dialects I often only find old people speaking the genuine dialects
For example in Halland they used to have verb plurals
"jak ska, vi skullum", Jamtland had cases "i huset" vs "i husan". Etc
and hungarian
> Modern day Elfdalian is quite similar yes, but historically the area around Älvdalen specifically was quite different from the rest if I understand it correctly
Not much different from its neighbours
Only the germanic nasal vowels I think are peculiar just to them
> Keeping the old Norse grammatical case system
A similar grammatical system with 3 cases is found in it's neighbours as well
Same for verbs and adjectives
Compare the two dialects from Älvdalen and Orsa in how they say "calf":
Elfalian | Sing
ind
| Sing
def
| Plur
indef
| Plur

| kåv| kåvẽn| kåver| kåvär

>I've been wondering about this
Do Norwegian actors often (or at all) change their dialects
Yes, it is quite common, and especially so for periodic dramas
In such cases it is almost always the case that the dialect they switch to is Oslo dialect, which is easy to impersonate, because it is so often heard in media
> that a child at least speaks a dialect that resembles (one of) their parent's dialect
Absolutely, no serious movie would show a child having a different dialect from its parents without a good reason
>Or that an actor is supposed to play a farmer from county X.
Not to a very large degree, but somewhat, yes
It's kind of "rude" (not the best word for it) to associate a dialect with stereotypes, especially in media
Fun fact: The dialects east of Oslo (Østfold) have a quite negative image
Many people associate it with ignorant farmers, and news anchors from there usually make a determined switch to the Oslo dialect to avoid the negative connotations (the difference between the two is pretty much just pronounciation, though)
No they arnt
I love coronation chicken
With raisins
I love Italian sandwiches with porchetta or mozzarella, pesto and tomatos
Norwegian style ones are decent as well - mayo, shrimps and lemon or skagenrøre
Avocado, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon
Peanut Butter and Jelly
Socialist People's Party (7>14) doubled their seats
Dang
The less left radical party, Radical Left, also doubled their seats (8>16)
But honestly best of all it is to see Danish People's Party (right wing populist) tumble from glory to gutter
And polls show that Norway is next
Red (socialist/social democrat) and Socialist Left (socialist/social democrat) is growing, and Progress Party (populist right) is dropping like a rock even measuring below Red on a few polls
You're just adapting to the future before it comes
Why would a career politician use the wrong definition
Seems sketchy to me
Why not Liechtenstein
Germany
But neither of them would be a bad choice
Just too bad my German is horrible
Probably Germany since I have a few friends there
Austria-we were once them
just a general question, what do hungarians feel about austria, and vice versa
like in regards to the former empire
I get you Finland
I live 10 min from the ocean, and that is far enough
I guess we tend to prefer what we are used to
The thing about UK is that your trains are super expensive
Basically everyting is much cheaper than norway, but the train and bus costs about the same
really strange, annoyed me when I lived there lol
Rather expensive especially on longer distances, but short distances aren’t particularly cheap either
More than €10 for a 30 minutes ride into Oslo on a suburban train and €50-70 one way isn’t unusual on more regional and longer distance trains
Yep, our trains are expensive and slow, yet heavily subsidised
It would be much more efficient to shut down some of the lines and invest in better roads
(Essentially, trains are mostly only effective if the passenger volume is  high
Which rules out most of norway except eastern part
Other parts of Europe, however, has high volume
The train budget is huge
Just 30% less than the road budget
The train ticket is subsidised and the plane ticket has high extra taxes
Yet, Oslo-Trondheim and Oslo-Bergen are on the top 10 bussiest flights in Europe (Bergen and Trondheim have like ~200k inhabitants
Trondheim-Oslo is the same distance as Gothenburg-Stockholm, but takes more than twice the time and is more expensive
Sorry for the rant
I just think technology should be judged based on its strengths and weaknesses, not because it has long historical roots
And btw, the new technologies that are coming in the next 10-30 years will make trains in norway look even more silly
Those technologies are better batteries for EV's and busses, cheaper vehicles, self-driven cars, electric planes (for short distances like oslo-trondheim & Oslo-bergen)
haha that's nice to hear, I live in bergen with family from oslo and have a fear of flying, so I take Bergen line very often
it's not too bad, relatively to, say a pint of milk
but newcastle for a tenner is unbelievable
I’m all in favour of trains and believe in trains and other rail solutions for the future
Having a solution where you transport more people together on the same distances makes more sense than having everyone in their own car, especially in and out of cities and within them
The problem in Norway is that we don’t put enough into our train lines and don’t do efficient work and investments
Instead they break the system up even more into different companies sucking more money making everything more expensive
In addition they don’t concentrate about one line or area at once and get it done
Several central and critical lines and projects should’ve been prioritised, like the only train tunnel through Oslo which only got two tracks since 1980
It’s also a matter of being realistic, there will never be a high speed line to Bergen
Why
Because of the nature
Instead there can be faster lines to say Stockholm and south to Kristiansand
Other countries with just as difficult topography has succeeded for a long time and we should look at them
Roads don’t help me much as I don’t drive and I hate traffic and roads and all about it
The planned road projects in this country are often insane, especially the plans about E39
We plan on scrapping roads which were new a decade ago, erasing more forest and fields
We tried enough Americanisation decades ago and it left enough scars
It's so funny when German people complain about DB
First world problems
DB is way better and cheaper than many other European train companies
I'm all for trains as long as the (public budget) cost per passenger-kilometer is less than 3x the cost of the alternatives
Very actively trying to relocate government offices outside of the capital
It feels like it's become a sin to have an office in the capital
They are everywhere in Norway
The government with is ministries and the supreme Court are in Oslo
The register of businesses is located in Brønnøysund, which is a tiny village in the North
The National agency for planning and building roads is in Kristiansand
The Norwegian School of Economics is in Bergen
And as a fellow Norwegian said, it feels like it's almost a sin to have a government office in the capital now
They're trying to close the police academy in Oslo now
The less attractive your town is to live in, the more likely it is to get a government office
Ever want to go to Brønnøysund or Mo i Rana
> he less attractive your town is to live in, the more likely it is to get a government office
So that's why most why Oslo got so many
:) Sure, some government jobs have been moved out of the capital, but Oslo still gets a very large share (and the most powerful ones)
Going to have to go with [Villanden By Ibsen] its a play, but its so boring, and having to interpret that the duck is symbolic for the girl
It still haunts me
Oh yeah fuck that
They really wanted us to think it was the best, most interesting and deepest too
They made us watch the play
So unbelievably boring
God damn it
Did you have to remind us that book exists :’D
I have never heard of a required reading program or anything like that here in Norway, and I'm currently a university student with all 13 years of public school behind me
Did everyone else get forced to read specific books
We usually read whatever we wanted, except for when the teacher read "Det angår også deg" for us in ninth grade
Did they make you see the version that seemed to be recorded in the 60s too
The only thing I remember about it is
there were walls and furniture
Awesome play
Yes, we had to study the different big authors
Ibsen and Hamsund
Did you not have to read sult in Norwegian class
If they did I forgot
Haha
Nah
We saw the movie, though
I think you got off easy
Most of us had to see the movie AFTER we read the book
Stor uff
I literally got a r/me_irl post after this and someone said "all I wanna say is "ehre (confusing German)"".
Well if you're from the interior of Russia or turkey you're not really European either though
"Switzerland isn't fucking insane, checkmate"
There's a few things that's important to notice if you compare the levels of disposable income between Western Europe and the US
Europeans doesn't really need to invest as much as Americans
Some of us live in countries with public pension plans
We might (should, in my opinion) have additional private plans as well, but the necessary savings to live comfortable lives in old age can't compare to a 401k plan
Many of us also doesn't really need to save for college for our kids, and since we have public healthcase our emergency funds needn't be that high
In some countries housing cooperations even offer life time leases, reducing the need for property investments
All in all, we may have lower disposable income than the average middle class American, but our need to save  invest is also lower (except for the Germans, they do it out of national habit)
Another factor is that these things vary between the countries
In my country the opportunities for investment and saving are quite good
Interest is low, and banks compete to lend us money
Capital gains tax are at 22%. Our total tax rate on income (including VAT) might seem high for Americans, but since I already have a public pension plan as well as private pension, our kids have no tuition to pay and health care is virtually free I may divest most of what's left  to things that's more fun to own
My biggest investment is my house
It's been ever increasing in value since I bought it in 2010, and is now valued at 650k USD
My remaining mortgage is just a fraction of that I also own some stocks and index funds that is basically just a method to put aside money for fun stuff
I also consider buying a cabin in the mountains
The reason I can do that is twofold:
1) Both my wife and I have higher education, and we earn slightly above the median income
Pooled together that income is quite high, placing us in the upper middle class income bracket
Double income households have huge amounts of disposable income compared to others, even though we only earn slightly more than the median
And households where both earners have higher education (ie Master's degree)  have an additional advantage on others in this respect
2) The tax system is rigged to promote investments in private property
Since World War II it's been an official policy that most Norwegians should own their own homes
Since the early 2000s low interests in combination with tax incentives has promoted an ever-ongoing property boom (as in many other countries) but with the high rates of home ownership the wealth accumulation of certain classes have increased substantially
Isn't that just for public sector employees
Over here, ALL employees gets a public pension through mandatory membership in a public insurance scheme called *Folketrygden
* A share of your taxes are paid as membership fees which in turn gives access to public health services, unemployment benefits, sick leave, parental leave as well as membership in a public pension plan
The public pension isn't really that good
Depending on the number of years you've worked you'll get anything from 36-50 % of your salary (and the salary calculations are capped at around USD 80k. Maximum payments are in other words around USD 40k)
In addition you'll get a pension plan paid from your employer
In the privat sector it can be anything from shitty (2% ) to good (7%)
The public sector have another system, which will guarantee 66% of the salary you had when you retired, which is an excellent plan
Thanks for letting me know, I didn't know that
I thought there was virtually no such things in the US
The maximum benefit isn't really that bad, it's quite good compared to many other nations
You've been listening too much to Bernie Sanders
Northern European Social Democracies are hypercapitalist export-oriented economies with a state-sponsored social security net
Taxes are low or non-existant on wealth, capital gains tax is low, and income tax is in the middle range
Welfare is funded by the working classes through membership in what's basically mandatory public insurance schemes granting benefits such as retirement, unemployment, disability, sick leave, parental leave as well as health care
In order to be eglible, you need to have an income
Income inequality are lower than for many other European countries, but wealth inequality is sky-high
In reality, income inequality is masked by the fact that  the upper middle class /lower upper class is  smaller than in many other countries
On the other side: The number of billionaires and multi-national companies per capita is way higher than in many other comparable nations, creating small elites that have abundance of cash
Same thing here
Pensions will also be paid by a fraction to the remaining spouse if you die
The financing is a bit different though
The base tax rate is a flat 22% on all income and capital gains
Employees have to pay an additional 8
1 % tax  on all income before deductions, that goes towards all public benefits (retirement, unemployment, parental leave, sick leave and universal health care)
On top of that high salaried employees pay a marginal tax of 9 % on income above USD 65k.
Since most people have lots of deductions (namely interest rates and children) a citizen with an average income will pay around 30-33 % in tax, where 8 % goes toward public benefit
Needless to say, the system is underfinanced and is kept up by contributions from the government
>No, I haven't. In fact, I dislike Bernie and his policies, and am a proud Biden-Harris Democrat
Sorry, I didn't mean to imply anything
I'm just a bit tired of the image quite a few Americans have of the Nordic countries, promoted by Sanders' rather exaggerated democratic socialist claims about our societies
There's very few S550 AMGs over here, but there are a lot of Teslas, high-end Audis and Volvos
Cars that easily costs around USD 100k.
The reason behind this is twofold:
1) Interest is low, and many have easy access to credit
Tesla even offered 100 % financing for .95% a while back
If you have a steady salary, you can easily afford such a car
2) Cars are taxed, but not by value
Electric cars are completely untaxed, there's not even VAT
Fossil cars are taxed by emissions
And since high-end cars often emit less than cheap cars the proportion of the tax is lower the more expensive the car get
You can by a cheap Dacia and 50% of the price will be tax
Or you can by a more expensive Audi and perhaps 25 % of the cost will be taxes
Guess what people do :-)
Happens all the time
I estimate that Norway within the next 100 years will speak 50/50 Norwegian/English
I forget words all the time
Sometimes I remember the English translation, sometimes don't.
All the time
My sentences are usually a mix of Norwegian and English words
Happens to me quite frequently as well for the same reasons
Last week on my finals I forgot the Norwegian word for "property". Luckily most people here know a lot of English so I can just say it in English and they'll understand most of the time
I agree that it's incredibly embarrassing
I hope not
Personally I think we should do as the Icelanders do and keep Norwegianify our loan words and do our utmost to keep our language traditional, maybe even go further from Bokmål over to Nynorsk
I think of language as a piece of history and how cool it would be to keep it constant without much change
Us in the Nordics don't translate our media and whenever a good idiom is mentioned I will remember it, but it just doesn't have the same charm in my own language
I completely agree with you
But I'm afraid we are already on a slippery slope there
Just listen to how children as young as 12-13 speak now
Lots of English mixed in
Even their prononciation of many words differ from how they would learn it in school
They can't say words like "kjøtt, kino, skjegg, kjøpe" how they are supposed to sound
And it just sounds weird to me
I'm from the west coast from an area with a very strong kj-sound
And now many young people say "skjøkken" instead of "kjøkken". So I know exactly what you mean
But then again languages have always been evolving all through the time (we would not be able to understand the Vikings now for instance
) So I guess in a way we just need to except what is coming
No one's saying Faroese :(
Norwegian
Where’s my Faroese friends at
I'm unsure what you mean about us making every statement a question
Takk
When it mattered the most, you forgot your policy of neutrality smh
Back at ya, brother (or sister
Agree
As a norwegian i agree, totally depends on the dialect tho
Yeah but you don't have other sounds for variation
Correct
So you’re left with only Northern Norwegian then
Denmark
Are you ok
Omg Denmark are you choking
It does
I don't think it does in my ^accent ^^at ^^^least
Tak means roof :)
It’s because we don’t speak with an apple or potato in our mouth
Takk = short vocal
Tak = long vocal
Because "Tak" is roof
What's weird is that there's an entire nation of choking people who still somehow don't die
... oh my god, Denmark is actually full of undead
There’s such a thing
Denmark, I've told you a billion times
We broke up 205 years ago
Get over it
Jk love you I dumped that "Sweden" guy
Love it haha
It wasn't higher pitched really
Highest point in the sentence for me was the 'a' in 'katten'.
Actually
I’m from northern Norway, and to me Danish has more of a high pitch at the end of a sentence than what I’m used to in my dialect
We in fact tend to go down at the end of sentences here in the north
This is why I always feel overlooked when people comment on what “Norwegian” sounds like, because it doesn’t apply to me
;-;
How do I say them after each other
Um, because I do
I don’t know, it’s just how our language works
When I say “tak” I drag out the a.
When I say “takk” the “pressure” isn’t on the a, but the k.
A double consonant means the wowel before it is short
A single consonant means the wowel before it is long
Oh yes
Neat idea
Same
Our national sub is mostly crap, I for one am not on there at all
NRK1, the main channel of the public broadcasting corporation
We have the same word for door and dies, *dør*. Not annoying to me but I find it funny
we have so little vocabulary compared to english
like say colour, there’s no way to say crimson, auburn, cerulean, viridian, maroon, etc
there’s no translation for words such as eerie and eldritch
The accent many/most native speakers get when they try to speak some English (unfortunately including me)
Otherwise I'm quite indifferent about the language
There's plenty of vocabulary
It's not the best way measure, but our dictionary is one of the ones with the most words
Colours are always difficult to traslate between cultures though
This is not true
There are Norwegian dictionaries that exceed the word count of corresponding English ones
And many of the words you mentioned do exist, but they are just not as commonly used
hahahah, nice one
Same thing, I forgot about it
Lik is the word
happy marriage if Norway, Sweden and Denmark merged
Albania
Merging with Kosovo
Countries are already in the talks about that
Macedonia could work out, seeing as 25% of the population is Albanian, and both countries havw good relationships
Montenegro; well, I think they wouldn’t like it, but us Albanians would, considering we have many people living there
Greece; simply no, for the best of everyone
Civil War, Balkan War 0
Been there done that
But this time we have oil
So nope
We get to marry Sweden, the world's prettiest girl
Yeeaaaay
> Russia: Over my dead body
Do anyone want to anymore
Hey, you go east, we get to keep Sweden
What about russia
^Å ^faen
We used to be that divorce child living some hundred years with one of our parents in shifts after all

i love you too Finland, but the language differances may lead to domestic violence
Don’t you guys make enough out of your fancy lamps, furniture, other design stuff and tv-series
I love you too Iceland, you could probably join and teach us some old norse like in the good old days:)
We dominating
Thank you
I believe this mix would become a more analytical language with less inflections like English
Even German and Icelandic are changing by losing the dative case
What is Babiš doing
Liberalism and communism are almost exact opposites
They asked about the closest
We have to go by boat to Denmark
They're pretty great people, too, though
Norway's lost kid returns :)
We’re trying yes
It's like the opposite of Welsh
Because they understand norwegian, we used to be very cruel towards them from the 19th-20th century, but what i meant by domestic violence is that there will be a lot of trouble because of our differances, but you guys know swedish right
so i think we can overcome our language differances
The Nordic Federation will rise
but in switzerland not every language is mandatory right
if its not i can't even imagine not understanding your fellow countrymen :/
Then leave, eliminate the negativity from your life
It can only get better
We do call tadpoles for rumpetroll (butt-trolls) though, which is even better
Best part is that the peak of Finland’s highest mountain is in Norway
The highest point of Finland is on a ledge on it, and in time of the finish Independence Day there were talks about giving them the mountain
He could be younger than 2003
I am born in 2004
I think there are probably better ways to solve that than providing school lunches
Then you are still left with kids only getting one meal a day and presumable the rest of the family still suffering from lack of food
Yeah but you would have to pay for it, like you can get milk and (used to) be able to get fruit, but all of that you have to pay for
So if they don’t have food, idk how they would pay for it
Or maybe it would be some other way of doing than the milk/fruit stuff
Yeah, the constitution explicitly states that we are an united country without a possibility to split
If there are enough seats around the main table then no, but if not then we do make a kids table
We used to have that for birthday parties with the family
The four of us cousins would be at our own table for the past 20ish years and now we just don't do much for our birthdays
Depends on the family, amount of tables and children (also their ages)
During my best friends wedding her and her new husband + me sat with most of the kids and the “adults” was at other tables
But that was just because they didn’t have any place settings and no one dared to sit with the bride and groom so the kids did
It was honestly quite a lot of fun
It depends on the day for my family
For example on the 23rd all the kids and teenagers  sit and eat rice porridge on a separate table, but on the 24th everyone eats together
I'd love to walk around a live comedy show in a nondescript uniform, asking people that question ("what is the joke and why do you find it amusing
") and writing down their responses on a formal-looking notepad
My tailor is rich
Luckily not
Nope, just throw away  any wrappers in a garbage bin when you're done and we're good
"Did you ever go to a place…I think it was called Norway
"No,” said Arthur, “no, I didn’t."
“Pity,” said Slartibartfast, “that was one of mine
Won an award, you know
Lovely crinkly edges
We have 20 judges in our supreme court, but most cases are held with only 5 of them
I had to google it, and there are 20 judges in surpreme court
I count 21
Also worth mentioning is that the judges have to retire form the Supreme Court when they are 70 years old
It's random
Supreme Court cases aren't very politiziced here, the courts don't make law they only interpret it
Most disputes they settle are relatively uncontroversial and not that important in the grand scheme of things
If they expect an issue to be contentious, then it's heard by all the judges
Norwegian number convention adopt both the Danish and Swedish conventions
The Swedish is like English system were 54 fifty-four is said femtifire
The Danish system takes after the German convention, so I could also say, fireogfemti
Some old type number names can be used, like fireogtredve (34) as opposed to trettifire (34)
The Danish system is a sort of the 'old way' of doing things, though I myself find myself doing this form the most
(Oh but we dont use tres and halvtres like the danes, ever though, we use the "normal (Swedish
/Norwegian) names for numbers)
We used to say one and ten like the germans, but they changed it in the last century sometime
People still use the old way sometimes though, I dunno, it just feels better sometimes
They changed it in 1951:
Quite similar to Japanese and Chinese
Can add that the Swedish/English way only came about in 1951 in a reform, before then we used only the Danish/German way
> (Oh but we dont use tres and halvtres like the danes, ever though, we use the "normal (Swedish
/Norwegian) names for numbers)
It was actually used in Eastern Norway in the 19th century, though extinct today
Actually it’s almost only the English language that has  a billion (10^9) and not a milliard
A milliard is the more common name(in Europe anyway) [list]
Some of our former army camps are turned into camps for asylum seekers
Mostly surprised by the small amount of people who identify with Labour parties, which I assume to be equal to social democratic ones unless I'm misunderstanding things, compared to socialists
And also by the relatively high percentage of asexual people
Interesting results

**Hip Hop:**

Other than them, most Norwegian Hip Hop artists sing in Norwegian and is therefore little known outside of our borders
Maybe in Sweden/Denmark
**Heavy Metal**
I don't know much about this, but the band Mayhem was one of the early bands that formed the Norwegian heavy metal scene
They were very controversial because of their live performances, they encouraged burning churches, their vocalist commited suicide in 1991 and one former member murdered their guitarist in 1993
The early Norwegian black metal scene was also important as it is credited with creating the black metal-genre and it has created some very influential artists within the Extreme metal-genre
Markus and Martinus, i guess they did not go too big, but leafy made two videos on them back in the day, so I guess that is something
Other than that aha made it big with take on me
sangerinden er sgu fra norge
The guys who sang only shit about Eurovision *on Eurovision*?
I would add Nico & Vinz who were nr
1 in more than 100 countries with "Am I wrong".
Alexander Rybak and secret garden are also well known
[Wardruna] is pretty popular but maybe not exactly mainstream
Never heard of Secret Garden, but sure
Yes, he was born in England and moved to Dana outside of Bergen, Norway in 1999
His father is British and his mother is Norwegian so he counts :p
Never heard of him, but if he's reached all the way to Slovakia, then sure :)
Damn, was about to add Turbonegro but I didn't think they are big outside of Norway lol
Sissel who
Sissel is an ordinary first name :)
selv den Danske Wikipedia-side medgir at hun er Norsk hahah
ESC winners of the year you were born (?)
Sissel Kyrkjebø.
Oh, ok
I wasn't born in '95, but I get it :)
Bus:
If you are entering the bus at the front entrance where the driver is, you usually say hi, especially for those that have to stop and show the driver their ticket (not everyone needs to)
And if you exit at the front I think it’s nice to say bye, I usually do but lot of people don’t (I’m not sure but I think saying it is more common)
If you enter/exit at the back you obviously don’t say hi/bye
Other interactions are kind of similar:
At the grocery store you don’t acknowledge those who work there until it’s your turn to get your items scanned
Then you say hi (sometimes gets left out), then after they’ve scanned they’ll ask if you want a bag and if you want a receipt, which you reply to
Then you often
(not always, depends on the cashier too) say bye, but it might get left out sometimes(/often
Other types of stores, for example clothing stores, have similar interactions as grocery store, but it opens up for a bit more
Sometimes a store worker might say hi or ask if you need help, to which you respond and then continue what you were doing
Here I would say that you basically always say bye after your purchase
There’s also a bit more possibility of some very quick small talk (like a couple one liners), though it’s still not that common
Edit- added something
I always give a little farewell wave to the bus driver when I get off
Imo Danes are better at this than Norwegians, not that I always understand what is being said but often some words are coming when buying a coffee, beer or just standing in line
I always smile and give a little nod when I enter the bus, a shopor a cafeteria, as do many other Scandinavians
We might be less verbal in our social interaction than southern Europeans, but it is not like we're cold people ignoring each other
This is the way
I noticed people thanking the bus driver when I lived in Vancouver, Canada
People thought I was cold for not acknowledging them, but in Northern Europe you're not *supposed* to acknowledge them
Well what do people around you, excluding your friend groups, do
I do get the impression that the Danes maybe are a bit more “extroverted” than us, but this was kind of surprising, can I ask what type of banter/remarks
Banter with cashier and remarks while standing in queue is something I don’t see much, and when I see it it’s often talkative men, who usually seem to be in their 20/30s or 65/70+.
Not sure exactly what you meant by weekend nights, you mean at parties right
That’s common here too
In my experience Danes are generally very jovial and more outgoing than Norwegians or Swedes
All Danes I’ve ever met seems to live on banter lol
And the same stereotypes are overblown for Norwegian and Swedes too btw, but of course there is some truth to it
(So I tried to write a short reply, but I suck at doing that, so here’s a long reply before I go to bed:)
Okay that one doesn’t sound terrible, but its not really the norm and most probably wouldn’t say anything, though it totally depends on how slow and the situation
Basically I feel like there usually needs to be a good reason, like a threshold has to be reached
I would probably (exceptions can happen) only comment the queue if it was like the longest or weirdest queue I had seen, and I got eye contact with someone
Then I could be like “Oi
” while looking shocked, or say something like “wow that’s a long queue”. Haven’t done this though
One time I kind of just looked surprised/shocked  and got accidental eye contact with someone who was already standing in the queue, and they were like “yah” and gave sort of a half-nod to acknowledge the situation, then I smiled, and that was it
Another example
I’ve had buses arrive pretty late (10-20 min), and often no one says anything, so we all stand in silence
But a few times (or more) I’ve experienced someone saying something, almost always starting with a question
I’ve been on both ends
For example one person might ask if someone remembers when exactly the bus was coming, the other says the bus is really late, the first person shows they’re annoyed at the bus, and  the other acknowledges this feeling and says that it happens a lot
Sometimes the conversation is over after two lines, sometimes a few more lines
If it’s an elderly person it can very well be longer
Then when someone sees the bus they might go “now it’s coming” or “finally
One time we just stood in silence while the bus was 10 min or so late (so we had probably waited 15min)
But when I saw the bus I loudly said “yes
I feel like when the bus is like 10-15 min late, remarks and even some small talk is kind of acceptable, and it’s not strange if you air out your frustrations or make a joke about the situation
I wouldn’t have full fledged conversations with strangers in the store unless we were drunk (never happened though)
I’ve definitely had conversations with strangers on the bus when drunk
Flåklypa Grand Prix (Pinchcliff Grand Prix) and it's sequels are all very good and charming stop-motion films, but the first one is usually considered the best
The books they're based on are even better imo
A movie based on the Hakkebakkeskogen is also really good from what I've heard
Flåklypa Grand Prix
Only good Norwegian car movie ever made
Terkel I Knipe was a major hit here as well
Loved that movie
And the [music] is amazing
That’s the one where the devil eats a potato with his ass
Yeah, going to see that movie in the cinema inspired him to make cars
It also inspired George Lucas pod racing:
Wait "yr" means horny
I thought it was a weather thing
Yes it does, but it's quite old fashioned way of saying it
For example "våryr" is a thing in Norway
When people get "excited" in the springtime
Yep, but pronounced rather differently
Not popular at all
At least amongst younger generations
Maybe some will have some facial hair, like a closely shaved beard, but other than that it’s not very common
At least in the part of Norway I live in
I believe it might has something to do with the fact that Nordic hair is generally thinner than other hair types, so maybe it’s not as easy to grow
I am not a man though, so this is purely from my own observation
Maybe I just live in an area where no one really grows facial hair
It comes and goes
Norway is not that formal so you can usually get away with whatever
For me it's more a result of laziness than a fashion statement
It's pretty popular here
The beard I have is small but dense enough so I grow it out about 5 millimeters but if I could, I would have a full viking beard
It's quite normal, but it comes and goes
I'd say around a third of all men are bearded
I've had my big, red beard for about 15 years now
And I'm bald
Back then people believed I was some sort of biker or something
Now way more people have it, like 35% of all men under 50
Guesstimating tho
Got curious about what part of the country your from, has to be like west coast
Where people are very aesthetic in their stupid teslas
This is exactly like my experience
Are political moustaches still a thing
It's just more work
I'd get rid of it if I could
“Thor” is unfortunately not a historically correct documentary on Norse mythology
I am sorry to bring you this unfortunate fact:/
I’m from the east, west of Oslo, so I see plenty of people flexing in their Tesla’s and Porche’s. You’re not wrong there
I considered the fact that it might be more geological that decides wether it’s popular or not, so that’s probably it
Might be
Also a social thing I guess, I dont see many hip besteborgere with beards
Good God I hate you guys :)
That's so interesting
Would Erdogan's moustache count as an islamist moustache
It's surprising that a pun would be more expensive
They're usually not funny and should fit right in with German culture
We live in a sad world:(
You know, i hate a lot of the people here as well
So many people who just have to brag about money and brands and etc
It gets tiresome pretty quick
I'm happy to hear that, it is like the lowest form of existence imo
Always chasing that false feeling of approval from the fellow man, based upon having the latest and greatest
These far-from-reality fools are often people of power, and I guess that is the reason why so much blatant corruption and other stupid shit can go on here
Only in Norway, as they say
Sorry about ranting tho, good vibes intended
I see
Thank you
Ahaha no worries
We’ll be crying in the corner having nighrmares about Milinkovic-Savic and that damned qualifier against Serbia
I love the way Brazilian Portuguese sounds (at least some of the dialects)
I also like Spanish a lot - where the dialects spoken in Spain are my favourites
Japanese, Italian, and Finnish
Personally I don't understand Portuguese (apart from a few words) but sitting in a street Cafe in Porto and Lisbon listening to the locals talk was an amazing experience, I love the flow of the language, the near sensuality of it, the softness
It is beautiful
Brazilian Portuguese - not to the same extent, it sounds somewhat harsher to me when spoken
And of course English, which I do speak and write to the point where I sometimes wonder whether I'm expressing myself better in English than in Norwegian
Lastly I would also mention Catalan, very different from Spanish, and also a beautiful language, although with some harshness to it
And I also want to support it since the Spanish government tries its best to suppress it these days
A language should never be suppressed,  banned and destroyed like the Castilians are attempting to do, so for that reason alone it deserves a place on my list
I really like japanese, it has a nice ring to it :)
Greenlandic is my favourite, but Welsh is pretty cool aswell
Danish and Japanese
I have never hear snatch as "speaking" in norwegian
Snatch means snappe - steal/catch/grab in norwegian
Seems like that have changed the meaning in norwegian as well
Speaking is not listed as the norwegian meaning of the word anywhere
Definitely funnier, but I don’t know about nicer
Just think of their famous sweet bread topping: *haaaaagelslaaaaaag*
Beautiful
Japanese is really beautiful
Have you heard they are giving out all the ghibli movies on netflix now
I alredy have all of them on dvd, but its nice that more people can discover ghibli :)
I think chinese is pretty as well
Fall in love with chinese after watching Emperess in the palace on netflix
Thats makes sense :) Snakke means speak in norwegian
Its intresting to see how woven together languages are in europe
It’s almost as enchanting as someone whispering „Ik hou van jou” in my ear
Hageslange means garden hose in Norwegian and prob Danish
Hage means garden and Slange means snake
So makes sense that way
Kaiser Wilhelm II has taken a lot of the blame for WWI and is not viewed very favourably by history
But in Ålesund, Norway, he is still remembered for the aid he sent when the city burned in 1904
The city hall's address is _Keiser Wilhelms gate 11_.
Probably some Danish or Swedish kings
We have some history wit them and it usually didn't end so well for us
Well, like eveey vikingking
Sigurd Jorsalfare/the crusader massacred some darn muslims in the holy land, probably women
and children too
I mean, Saint Olaf is literary our national saint, but he massacred chieftain after chieftain opposing him, as well as burning farming families alive in their own housed, cooking opponements alive, cutting their bodies piece for peace, putting snakes into their throats and letting them bite their victim to death or till they come out, also having a mouse under a cup and putting a warm object onto the cup, panicing the mouse/rat to dig thru the living human the cup lies upon
He also **raped small girls**. He did all that stuff because he wanted pagans to convert to christianity and the slow convertion his father and other forefathers had begun was too slow
So yeah, that's why we celebrate him each year at Olsok etc, because he converted us norwegians and saved our souls from the eternal fire
Surprisingly how little controversial he is tbh, lol, he also killed a bunch of russians and thus had to flee from thus exile in Russia if I remember correctly
We sure showed Karl XII
It stings that he gave Norwegian territories like Jemtland and Herjedalen to the Swedes
Just part and parcel of being in an unequal union, I suppose
Were you thinking he wasa hero or villain in Norway
I don't think he's talked too much about these days
Maybe in the past, but as Norwegians we call the union with Denmark Firehundreårsnatten ("The Four Hundred Year's Night"), so we might not single out just one Danish king
I think Norwegians can see that he did both good and bad things looking back, so maybe he's not seen as either a hero or a villain these days
Not at all worried about it (for Norwegian, but very concerned for Sami languages)
We definitely have no problem speaking English with tourists, but if someone moves to Norway then most Norwegians will expect them to learn the language
English is very practical to use internationally
But I mean, I'm not even worried about losing our dialects, so I'm definitely not worried that Norwegian itself will disappear
Norwegian here
I care extremely little about Norwegian and would not care at all if it got replaced by an English-like hybrid or "pure" English
I think the reason for my lack of care for Norwegian is that I use English as my work language
Everything I write, e-mails, reports, and so on is in English and every technical term I use are English
Most of the technical terms I use don't even have Norwegian counterparts
Measly 10% of the media I consume is in Norwegian, and most of those 10% are newspapers
Don't watch Norwegian TV, barley watch Norwegian movies, but I do watch the big "noteworthy" ones
Only thing other I can think of than vikings would be a "budeie" maybe
Typical job for females at the barn, making cows, taking care of the animals and stuff
And I guess sailors are, or rather were, a huge work market when my grandparents were young at least
My granddad was a whaler and so were several of his brothers and friends (cute story: he did quit after my mum was born, because he couldn't bear being away from her
He had one sailing trip when she was just a few months old, came back after she turned one and he swore never again, and then became a prison guard instead)
The trappers who wintered around the Greenland and Barents seas (most in Northeastern Greenland and Svalbard) in order to catch animals for their fur are probably the closest equivalent to the rugged cowboy archetype
The dangers they faced were mostly from the harsh climate and the occasional polar bear
They rarely feature in fiction, but non-fiction books about them and intrepid polar researchers tend to sell well
In Norway it would not be the lumberjacks, but "fløterne" that was the cowboys
Fløterne was the guys transporting the timber downstream rivers, an extremely dangerous profession
Here are some from the 1950ies
First time I hear of this
Although we have a Norwegian word: "rakker", lovingly used about a mischievous child
"Du din lille rakker/rakker-unge
Rakkere was often the assistants of the executioner, and had to clean up the execution place and take away the body
The executioners were low rank in the society and rakkere was even lower
I took a Norwegian Language History class and learned this is exactly where "rakker" comes from
A "rakkerunge" was something you definitely didn't want to be, because then your parents handled corpses and shit and nobody wanted to touch you
It was pretty much the lowest of the low of social classes
So like the untouchables in India
Interesting
13th century during reign of Håkon Håkonsson
Maybe 9th-10th centuries to experience the unification of Norway
1969 when Norway found oil and the cold war was in full swing
Pretty exciting
I wish i grew up in the 60s
I didn't like that summer because i don't have an AC
My house gets to hot and open windows didn't help
About all I know is that there's been a surge of right-wing populist, reactionary, xenophobic, homophobic etc
nutjobs in Poland - as well as other places
In fact I don't think anyone's been completely spared
It's a very worrying trend
I don't think anybody was suggesting the migrants themselves are at fault - except for the ultra xenophobes, of course
Well, no
But «Olsenbanden» had many funny translation jokes, like the time they translated the names George, Robert and James into Georg, Rolf og James (norwegian pronounciation)
And I also know about a TV—reporter in the 1950s that would often invite foreign guests and speak to them in english
Nowadays, when every norwegian know close to fluent english, it becomes pretty funny
His pronounciation was shit and he mostly translated wrong, like confusing a bathrub with a frigerator and when he responded to his foreign guests they would often look confused
Lol, the good old days when you could just pretend speaking english and nobody noticed ...
And I can't not mention «It's not the fart that kills, it's the smell» by Petter Solberg, a rally driver
Fart in norwegian=speed, smell=coalition/hit
So he ment to say «it's not the speed that kills you, it's the hit» but his englishskills are by far more known then his abilities to drive fast, lol
But is that used for any geographical places
I know there are places with ''á'', ''å'', ''â'' and ''č''.
We got 7
The northernmost is in Trondheim, as such, the closest IKEA to me (living in northern Norway) is in Haparanda in Sweden
Funny thing is, if they do decide to build an Ikea in northen Norway (which they have tought about), they want it in Tromsø, so
still the closest IKEA will be on the Sweden/Finnish border
idiotic
I think there is a bunch of them, but i have only seen two or three
Thought there would be more stores
You have one
In the country
The distances and time it takes to drive are laughably short in vestland
or the whole of southern norway for that matter
Since the IKEA's are placed smart in that part of our country
Tromsø-haparanda or bodø-haparanda is about 8 hours driving one way
Bodø-trondheim is about 12, you can do it in 10 if you push it
Shipping is so expensive it sometimes costs more than what you buy there
One strategically placed IKEA in Ofoten area can serve northern norway, aswell as some parts of (sparsely populated) sweden, cutting down travel time considerably for most of northern norway apart from Finnmark
Oslo has 2
There's one near Hamar, a couple of hours north of Oslo
The rest are near Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger and Kristiansand (the second to fifth largest cities)
> There have been several occasions where I was just waiting for a friend somewhere in town standing against a wall for perhaps 10-20 minutes and I was approached by some white people asking me if I sell drugs
Wtf
It's sad that it is this way, but If the Netherlands is anything like Norway, I can see why it happens
A lot of the street level pushers in Norway are African and lots of times they're, well, standing against walls
I’ve heard people say stuff like that on a few occasions
I remember one conversation I had:
Friend: «I just met this African American guy who blablabla».
Me: «Where in the US is he from
Friend: «What
No I think he was born in Senegal
Me: «Oh
But he’s lived in the US
Friend: «What
Why are you bringing up the US
Me:
A family friend said this (in a friendly manner) to my gf a little while back
“Well you must be used to the sun huh”. Like wtf
The person fully who said it fully well knows she was born and raised here, so out of all the little things we’ve experienced in our biracial relationship this wasn’t the worst, but it’s definitely the thing that confused me the most
I completely agree with you, and I'm not in any way trying to excuse their behavior, I just wanted to chime in with the reasoning as to *why* I think that happens
I do however think it's more ignorant than it is racist
I'm Sami myself and I've had my fair share of people making assumptions about me based on that fact alone, but most of the time, it's simply because they've never had an experience with anyone of Sami origin before, and assuming that they're racist just because they might have bought into a perceived stereotype, I don't think is constructive
Racism has become this sort of catch-all accusation, even towards people with no malicious intent and I really don't think it's healthy for the public discourse and social progress in general, especially since racism, for most people, is perceived as an act of active hatred against another race and *not* as ignorance and being accused of it for seemingly no reason just dissuade people from having a conversation about race all together
I don't condone stereotyping based on ethnicity, but I feel the need to say something when people throw the word "racist" around to casually
Assuming you are a drug dealer because you lean up against a wall and have roots from Africa is stupid, stereotypical and careless
It is however, in no form or way racist
Do white people in the western world have an easier time, I'm sure we do
Is it fair
Not at all, and most of us do not think that way
A bad apple spoils the bunch, and you've felt it personally
That sucks, but like you said, not all old white men are pedophiles
Therefore I can't apologize for them, but I can tell you that they are idiots and you should never feel like a victim of their shitty behavior
Rise above it, and show them how small they are
Don't let anyone make you a victim
And that makes me sad, truly, and motivates to work against it even more
Best of luck to you, and have a grear weekend
I do not think there has ever been a debate if Norway is not a part of Northern Europe or Scandinavia
There might be debate wether we are in western europe or not
I like your reasoning
As a western, northern, and absolutely Scanidnavian Norwegian, we are still refering to you based on the once important iron curtain
We'll label each of the following countries _eastern_ Europe: Bulgaria, Albania, Balkans (I know it's not one country
), Romania, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia and Poland (yup)
Russia and its former Soviet Union states like the Baltics, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine are the eastest you can imagine
Example: Headlines in our newspapers will still label criminals from all the countries mentioned above as _eastern europeans_.
Denmark cannot into Scandinavia
A stupid debate, but a debate nevertheless
For an outsider remembering the cold war like it was yesterday, it's easy to lump you guys into the "east" (Back in the day we only had east and west
This was before sliced bread, mind you)
If it wasn't for your (and CZs) languague, I can definitely understand why you would claim central Europe though
Edit: And as soon as this corona thing is fucking done with, Slovenia will be the first country I'll visit
The term east and west europe is from the cold war, when europe was divided into soviet or american spheres of influence
The baltics, and hungary, are in eastern europe
Your feelings about that changes nothing
I dont understand how that will change
Do you have a project for rewriting history or changing the past somehow
East or west europe has nothing to do with the situation, cultural or economical, in any country, its about wich sphere they used to belong to
> yes, and it's getting less and less accurate and getting outdated
FFS you have a dictator running your country
You have _never been more east_ than you are now
(And I'm saying "east" as in cold war east)
Interesting and educational
And natural, if you think about it
But I wonder, do Slovenes speak German (or Italian) like for instance us Scandinavians speak English
Yeah the Baltic-Scandinavian closeness is pretty one directional
I have never ever heard any Scandinavian saying anything about that
Like the last 100 times this was asked, yes
Yes
Kind of rude not to
(Why would you make someone else's floor dirty when it's so easily avoidable
Yes abseloutley
I can't imagine wearing shoes inside my home
Yes, because I'm not a savage
If I lived in a cave, I'd wear shoes
I live in a house, so naturally I take off my shoes
Do people clean their floors every day
>  Why would one want to track all the dirt from outside into the house
That is exactly how I would translate it directly from Norwegian
"Track" = "tråkke" :)
Would be kind of weird sitting around in your rain boots watching TV
Do walk around inside with your rain boots on
Or watch TV in your winter boots
(Or do you have designated indoor shoes on wet / cold days
Made me laugh
Thanks
I know
Sweaty indoor feet
Lovely
> So do you just walk around in your bedroom with outdoor shoes and sit at your desk and cook and everything in outdoor shoes
I just find that so incredibly hard to imagine ':D
Like when it rains - do they walk around inside with their rain boots on
Or watch TV in their winter boots
Ah I see
We usually clean floors only once a week
Exception; kitchen floor
(We have children)
I know
I was talking about Norwegian
> Most just wear their normal shoes
I live in Norway
Wellingtons **are** our normal shoes
Well, at least certain times of the year
I estimate that my children wear Wellingtons to school 90% of the time between October and April
Why not just walking on your socks
> Because you actually leave footprints if you're barefoot, even with socks
But luckily they wont leave any mud behind
> the floors will be ceramic tiles, which can get cold unless you have radiating floor
That is a good point
Tiles can feel like ice
I think the more north in Europe you get, the more rain and mud there is
In a warm and dry climate I guess it makes less sense to take the shoes off (if you don't mind warm feet)
Everything is expensive
"Poor" people eat instant ramen, rice, pork chops and store brand pasta
Tourist eat whale, raindeer, bacalao and pinnekjøtt which is expensive and is usually enjoyed by locals on special occasions
Earlier,  tourist used to think smoked salmon was exciting, bot not any more
I'd be morbidly obese if I lived in a place where I could get currywurst "just anywhere" on the streets
> Yet you see the Swedish meatballs, brown sauce, mashed potatoes and lingonberries for €50 in restaurants
WTF, where
If in Stockholm, let me know where
I have to go there on business in a few weeks
I need to check it out for a good laugh
Red sausages maybe
What's your national dish
> I honestly have absolutely no idea what tourists eat in Denmark
Overpriced smørrebrød. Was just in Denmark, so I know
What do students (living on their own) eat over there
Frikadeller
> Stroopwaffel
I have actually tasted some
You are supposed to put them over coffee
What do they make it from
Unicorn meat
I love smørrebrød. I avoid the tourist spots though
Oh I see
[This one in Bergen is pretty cozy]
We used to have [this McDonald's] in my town, but it closed a few years ago
There is a bakery in that building now that also sells pizzas in the evenings
Funny thing is, the building is one of the few older buildings in the downtown area left standing
Most of the buildings around it are from the 1970s or later
McDonalds in Kristiansand has a quite nice entrance aswell
You can even eat in the bank's vault
"Her kommer vinteren, her kommer den kalde fine tida" (Here comes the winter, here comes the cold and good times)
Norwegians and the winter has a special relationship
There are covers of that song in every genre and the songmaker has a almost national hero status (Jokke from Jokke & valentinerne)
E6 by DDE, a song about the road that goes through most of the country
Norway
"Dovregubbens Hall"
Literally one of the best songs ever
Correct answer would be "Waltzin' Mathilda", no
Yes, quite normal but also unusual
It would be seen as something exotic, but not wrong in any way
Not very common
Some have them for food, but most just have them as pets
I don't think there's any wild ones here
I never had rabbit, but I know people who hunt and eat it regularly
Deer is fucking delicious, especially reindeer
Duck breast is also absolutely amazing
Yep
We do
Atleast deer, but rabbit too
Not very common, but in my experience eating wild hare isn't frowned upon either
Would like to try hunting and eating some, I've already killed one on accident though
Never heard of anyone eating rabbit or hare here
Not seen it in stores or at restaurants either
I've never heard of someone who ate a rabbit/hare that was bought at a store
Also, I think most people think of them as pets rather than food so if someone did, it would be frowned upon
But I can see people eating it if they hunted it themselves
Maybe rabbit
Idk abiut you man, but finnbiff forever
In fact one of my favourite dishes is sauteèd Reindeer
I have spent many months if not years of my life in south sweden and never have i heard of someone eating rabbit there
Try it
Try dick breast, and try souvas (basically reindeer tacos)
Edit: Just realized I spelled dick breast lol, not gonna remove it
Dad moved for work
....I got married
We were living in Palestine/Israel when we moved to Europe
Iceland and the Faroe Islands
The Faroes are like a Bizarro-World, shrunken-down Iceland (shrunken-down in terms of area and population, and even the people themselves; they're like Icelandic Hobbits)
We share a lot of cultural and linguistic history, but the Faroes are just *so* remote in spite of the continued ties with Denmark
It shows in a lot of their religious and social conservatism, in stark contrast to Iceland's general lack of religiousness and social liberalism
But otherwise, I just feel like I'm in a small town in Iceland
Sweden and Norway
It always freaks me out listening to Dutch, and how there are so many similar words with Scandinavian languages and how I kind of understand what is being said
Yet it sounds completely different
The Netherlands is just Denmark with some added bricks in the streets and parking lots
I've lived in Denmark and Germany but didn't spend any longer than a weekend in the Netherlands until just a few years ago
I really don't know what I was expecting, but I was blown away by how familiar it felt
Of course none of that should have come as any surprise
It even became frustrating after a while because I felt like I could respond to people when they addressed me in Dutch; I'm fluent in German/Danish/Norwegian/English, so Dutch isn't much of a leap and I can understand a lot of what I hear, but then when I'd go to answer I didn't have the words because *I don't speak the language*
You say that now and then one day you want a bottle of wine so you go to the local shop and they don't sell any because that would be illegal
So you go to the government ran wine monopoly instead but they're closed because tomorrow is pentacost
i read a study yesterday claiming that deep down all scandinavians really resent each other after centuries of war
Nonsense
We're different peoples with different cultures
hope there is a phase 4 too, we don't want to be left out
Who in their right mind would want wine when you could have all the [karsk] you want
That's a fair point
The same case goes for Iceland re: church membership
You're born into it, few people regularly attend, but unless you make a point to un-register, you're still counted among the country's Lutheran population
Could it also be the case that in the Faroes, the conservative religious population is just more vocal than the rest, and that gets amplified by the small population
Re: conservatism, I speak from the Icelandic perspective, which skews very liberal even by Nordic standards
I've only visited the Faroes a few times so I don't have a any real insider insight, but from the impression I get it's about the same as some small rural towns in the Norwegian Bible-belt
And in your defense, I've never personally encountered any of the notorious Faroese homophobia, and I'm a gay guy
(Not that you read it that way, but just to be clear I've never had anything but positive experience in the Faroes and with Faroese people, so I hope I didn't come off as harsh or snobby
[This video] always cracks me up, it's a Norwegian guy speaking pretend-Dutch to Dutch women on a speed date
The second hand embarrassment is real though
I’d agree
Hehe jeg er egentlig enig med deg
Heldigvis er det hovedsaklig en trøndersk ting, og jeg bor på Østlandet
Skiten er jo nesten like ille som ananas på pizza
Ditto
Enig
The Danish dialect is incomprehensible and Sweden is full of Swedes
As others have mentioned, making friends can be difficult, the few "tricks" i know involve:
Getting drunk at bars, listen around and you might be able to join some conversation and get to know a new group of people
If you enjoy football you can also try "fotballpub", basicly a bar that regularly shows matches, they can be nice communities unless it only consists of drunks over 50
University - Students have tons of activities and clubs to join (I live in a university town, and there are tons of groups to join, like climbing, kayaking, skiing, snowboarding, even sky-diving and para-gliding
Alternative-culture - Might be a tricky one, i know the skateboard culture is quite active, there is also somewhat of an underground rave scene that announces parties through closed facebook groups
Might meet some that can get you in at night-clubs
Make no mistake, there are "drug fiends" in this community but also sober people who just like to dance and have a good time
&#x200B;
It is true that a lot of Norwegian conversation is light, never bringing up what really bothers you in life or bother people with your problems
If any, its said in sarcasticly self-loathing style and laughed off
But it depends, I work in stage/concerts, and it consists of a weird bunch of people, borderline alcoholics, family dads, autistic nerds, druggies and so on
I was almost a bit flabbergasted when after a big breakup i had with my girlfriend of 10 years a colleague took me aside and asked if i ever wanted to talk, to just ask, and he was adamant that he wasn't just paying lip service, he wanted to help
So we Scandinavians can be human on the inside, we just have a hard exterior and it might take some time to get to that level
&#x200B;
For a small comparison, Swedes are seen as quite outgoing to Norwegians, there is the idea of the "party svenske", who is very happy and outgoing
The swedes I've met in my town are very friendly and we always get along
There are several of them here for work, so they're not uncommon
I've never socialized with Danes my own age, so I have no input on them
Rural, it’s often not happening much outside of the major cities, socialising can be difficult when you don’t have the right venues and places to meet others, people tend to live pretty isolated
This can of course variate and be different for different people in terms of interests
There’s often sparsely with shops, cultural venues and cafes/restaurants/pubs etc
Smaller towns are often destroyed by malls within or outside of them, filled with the same boring shops with the same boring stuff
Shops in general in Norway is filled with the same things, the same supermarket chains rule the country, there’s no variation in what is sold
Don’t expect to find your Appenzeller, Gruyere or Pecorino there
Car reliance is a thing
You often have to know someone through work or school to connect with anyone, that’s how your social circle starts up here
Starting a conversation or approaching someone just out of nowhere is often a big no-no
Being different can be a challenge, hence Janteloven
Don’t presume to get any creds for your education or achievements, jealousy is often triggered and people are not interested in such things in the outback (winter tires and fuel prices is more their cup of tea)
Wishing for more, something better, something different is often prohibited
You’ll just sound negative and be isolated
The oil made Norway pretty lazy, making something else like local handcrafts is not encouraged, craftsmanship is much extinct
Made in Norway does not exist
Don’t have any ideas, if you do and decide to open anything up you might be bankrupt the first month anyway
Don’t have different political ideas, like being pro EU in Norway, the majority has decided that we’re staying out because the EU is evil, you’re not allowed to talk about it
*This comment is a bit sarcastic, blown up and harsh, but also true*
Today in Norway there are more males than females among the younger generations
If you want a Norwegian girlfriend the competition is hard
(Actually all over the world, but some countries are more skewed than others)
Among the people who are around thirty years old the percentage of immigrants is around 30%. It is positive if you want to hang out with immigrants, but negative if you want to learn Norwegian or make Norwegian friends
Also negative if you want a more well paid white collar job
The competition is tough, and harder for immigrants
We don't take properly care of our language, but let universities use English and don't teach immigrants our language or demand that they learn it properly
Next generation is going to speak a very simplified Norwegian
All the advanced words, wordplays with proverbs etc are going to die out
It get worse when you know that the Danes are often considered the most outgoing of us
After I moved to Hungary I've realized that I actually think the weather plays a major role
People go out and meet up more often if it doesn't suck going out, and the culture of going out to eat with friends is muuuch rarer in Norway, which is understandable considering you'd go broke if you try to do it regularly, but this is definitely one of the things I am most jealous about with southern Europe
If spoken slowly, danish is intellible thoe
Quite possible, we did have almost two hours of continual sun yesterday
Ka-me-lå-så.
Did you ever read on one of the incel subs
Or you can read a bit about what happens when there is a gender imbalance, for example violence against women increase with a higher male to female ratio (but obviously not right away)
Or you can read anthropology, about why men go to war in smaller societies
Of course it is a competition, the same way that women compete to get the "best man". It is both a competition but also, of course, a quest to find someone you have things in common with etc
But how to find that person when someone else already picked her up
Nynorsk is dying even faster, I think
Many immigrants don't learn it at school
My friend from Somalia, who lived here now for 26 years, just says she thinks it is pointless to learn it
She still makes so many mistakes when she speaks, because nobody told her
Ja, hva i helvete sa du om oss
Efterlignings-spagetti
Yes, but the wars the last centuries + of course the risky life of premature babies meant that more women grew up
There hasn't been the same amount of single young men compared to single young women
Even when you find a girlfriend within your social circles etc, there will be more men who can't find any
Because there are more young men than young women
And I don't know why you are so certain that I am a young man myself
You can probably find some old books, but also my daughter's education in nynorsk was atrocious
They read so very little nynorsk, also
you need exposure to get used to the flow of the language
In many ways nynorsk is prettier than bokmål, because it is more verbal and less substantives
Maybe the reason why they have more poets pr speaker
(It seems so, anyway
[Here] are a few books from antikvariat
net
They are meant for people who already know bokmål, though
It's nice to know that when we have a national emergency and the apocalypse is knocking on the door, the Danes and your butter got out backs
Teifl, my new favorite word
It's quite common to speak sami in inner Finnmark, I'm sami but grew up in an area of Finnmark with more norwegian speakers, so I'm not that good at speaking it myself but I can understand it just fine
Overall though, it's a very miniscule amount of the country who speak it, less than a percent of the population
It would be very sad if it dies out
I hope Finnmark is able to keep it alive
This was really interesting to read
Thank you for this nugget of historical insight
Where in Norway
There are quite a lot of good ethnic restaurants in Oslo if you know where to go
From Torbjørn Egner's "Folk og røvere i Kardemomme by" (When the Robbers Came to Cardamom Town), the song of the police chief:
"Man skal ikke plage andre (You shouldn't bother/pester others)
man skal være grei og snill (you should be nice and kind)
og forøvrig kan man gjøre hva man vil
" (otherwise you can do as you please)
We have so a lot of these sayings
And i feel like it's often from poetry
An example is "Du skal ikke tåle så inderlig vel den urett som ikke rammer deg selv" wich transelates to "you should not endure/tolerate the injustice/suffering that does not affect your self
You think we'll beat Serbia
That's kind of you
Whoever makes it, send us a postcard
Why do you think Scotland wouldn't be able to support an independent economy
Bankrupt - just like Norway you mean
That everyone has to be happy and sporty and positive all the time
Sometimes I'm annoyed, sometimes I'm bored, sometimes I think whatever we're supposed to do (at work or wherever) is stupid as shit
Negative reactions are 1
necessary in order to identify negative things, and 2

You don't even need the American flag flair with this post
During the middle ages, there wasn't really a permanent capital
It changed depending on where the monarch decided to live, but in 1314 the king decreed that the bishop in Oslo would be the nation's chancellor for the rest of time, so that's when it became the permanent capital
In 1537 Copenhagen became the official capital of both Denmark and Norway, which lasted until 1814 when the union was dissolved after Napoleon's loss, and Oslo (Christiania at the time) was made capital again
Norwegian: "Det gir jeg en god faen i"
Literally: "I give a good damn about it"
We can also say "Jeg bryr meg ikke" (I don't care)
But we don't have any of the Swedish short versions (to my knowledge)
But I would normally say: "Det bryr meg midt på leggen
" Meaning "I only care up to the middle of (my) calf". And since that is pretty far down on my body it show just how little I care
There's probably other expressions too but I am having a slow day here
Det bryr meg midt i ræva = that worries me right in the arse
If you were missing something about the nether regions I mean
The Iraqi geologist [Farouk al-Kasim] discovered and helped us secure our oil reserves
And politician Carl I. Hagen wanted us to sell the rights to drill for oil to the Americans
Imagine how different everything would be
I shudder at the thought
Carl I. Hagen was the leader of our populist right leaning political party, some of us love to remind people that a foreigner secured our oil and he almost screwed over the whole country
We have Russ (search it up)
We have allemannsretten, which means you can camp into the wild for like 3 days
We have a female primeminister, the fatest in Europe
Norway exists
Norway has two official and hundreds of unofficial written forms of norwegian, Bokmål and Nynorsk
There only live 5 million in Norway
Norway is in NATO and not in the EU
Norway is handing out the nobel peace prize
Yet Norway is one of world's greatest exporteurs of weapobs of massdestruction, we sold uranium to both Israel and Iran, and are selling a ton of weapons to Saudi Arabia fighting in Yemen
Norway has some disgusting food, just like Iceland and Sweden
Norway is one of the largest countries in the world, if seawater is accounted for
Continental Norway controlls Jan Mayen, Svalbard and Bjørnøya in the arctics
As well as Peter Is island, Bouvetøya and Dronning Maud land in Antarctica
Svalbard in Norway holds the world's seed bank, with samples of all millions of plants from across the world
Svalbard is also basically only under norwegian protection, which means that foreigners easily can get acces to the island and live there
A case was a lithuanian fishing crew fishing an endangered specy outside the island thoe, I think they lost their fishing certificate but due to EU regulations we couldn't give them tickets to pay for their «crimes against enviromental protection». A bunch of islands also got special right in 1920 on the islandgroup, but only Russia still holds these
Thus Russia has a town on Svalbard, Barentsburg which looks like an old soviet town, and they are mining coal there as well
Ahh, Kalle Anka
You have «Pippi Långstrømp» as well
Yeah, my german teacher's father was born in Breslau

Has Carl I. Hagen ever done anything positive for the country
I'm genuinely curious about what he has achieved
I know FRP has voted for paying 100 billion NOK on removing the toll stations based on Carl's proposal
The money they want to use on that is going to be taken straight from the oil fund

Norway had one too

by Erlend Loe
Anything by Erlend Loe if you like weird humor
Like the book about the guy who's had enough of being a decent citizen and sets up a tent to live off the land in the forest on the outskirts of Oslo (Doppler)
If you like classics, I suggest Mysteries by Knut Hamsun
>Isn't Jo Nesbø popular everywhere
It's popular many places in Europe, but I personally don't know any Americans who had heard of his books, I never even saw his books in bookshops in the US
We lost our formal 'you ("De") in the 60's... Since then we haven't been particularly formal up here
I would have no problem (at all) using our prime minister's first name while talking to her for instance
And calling someone Mr or Ms/mrs is completely out of the question
Neither do we normally say Doctor so and so or Lawyer so and so - unless pointing out their profession is important for understanding what I'm trying to say
> but mate you were holding me while I was puking in the gutter last night, you can stop talking to me like I'm some royalty now
I remember there being some kind of expression for being on a "tu" basis (tutoyer or something like that)
Way back when I knew French
But yeah, that situation would make royalty have a "tu" relationship with you
> In Spain, students of all ages call their teachers by their first names, and using tú - never usted or anything formal
> Outside Spain, this is considered very weird
Here teachers tend to be closer to the students, you can joke with them as long as you remember they are the authority
Spain, you can into Scandinavia
[No, it's terrible here]
About when does that change usually happen in Germany
How do you pronounce it
I have Polish neighbours living in the flats above us
Would be nice to randomly say that to them when they pass by
Yeah, this is normal in Norway
Certain girl names often has an -is suffix with younger people:
Ingeborg = Ingis,
Sunniva = Sunnis,
Stine = Stinis
People tend to grow out of those nicknames when they get older, though
At least in my experience
Whaaaat, I've never heard that, except with Nathaniel -> Nathis
To be fair, nicknames weren't very common where I lived
The ones who did have them mostly ended with -e, like Sebastian -> Sebbe, or just with whichever letter made sense with the rest of the name
Most names were just shortened, like Theodor -> Theo and Alexander -> Alex
Yeah, same here
I feel Norway in general isn’t big on nicknames
In my area the only consistent trend was the -is on certain girl names, though we do have our Bens and Theos, too
My name is quite long with 4 syllables so it was always shortened by simply chopping it in half, same with some of my other friends
But most people had 3-5 letter names, and there is no point in shortening those
So I guess that contributes to it
In my area we don’t use nicknames, but if the person have a special last name we just call them that
I have a lot of friends that is wierd calling Kristoffer or Magnus because we call the by their last name
Yeah, that’s a good point
> What is it like growing up in Georgia
I actually don't have a clue
Sorry Georgia that I know so little about you
Neither exists
Small audience I guess
Good point
Being poor in our part of the world means you cannot afford out of school activities (if you are a child)
Or that you own only one winter jacket
Or that you travel by bus instead of owning a car
Or you spend the summer at the beach instead of travelling to Thailand or Hawaii
It never means having to live in the car with the rest of your family
Or not being able to afford going to the doctor
Or not being able to buy life saving medication
Or not being able to go to the university
Or not receiving any care when you get old and sick
Facebook says it will stop operating in Europe if regulators don’t back down

Insane
This was something I noticed with Poland, a lot of people had billboards in their backyard
I don't know if I've ever seen that here in Norway
Everything is so pretty now
If Norway stopped other countries like Russia and Saudi-Arabia would only increase production to stabilize oil supply and demand to retain prices
But yes, I agree
It would be for the best if everyone would agree to gradually stop oil drilling
That's so dramatic lol

It's no policy that all are European, and it is actually beneficial to have mods living in completely different timezones :)
This is very interesting, and the first time I see this photo
Thanks for sharing
Considering he killed himself I am pretty sure he eventually realized, though he should have known much earlier
If he knew then why didn’t he surrender, did he see it as a sign of weakness
Thats very intresting
Will they build it up again you think
Oh no, this is terrible
A lot of history going up in flames
I'm not religious but this physically hurts to watch, looks like it's going to be totalled
Devastating
As a Catholic the sight of this is heartbreaking
I can only hope for a future rebuilding
Just hope paintings and invaluable objects inside are extracted in time
The church itself isn't invaluable, the objects inside are
This is just sad
We will see some very sad photos tomorrow

> All of the government party heads are women, and many of them are notably young
Just like Norway
I think we might need some equality soon
>All of the government party heads are women
Is there any outcry for equality
Denmark
It's interesting that here in Norway the coalition making up government has 3/4 female party leaders, and the top 3 positions of prime minister, minister of foreign affairs, and minister of finance are all held by women who are from the the parties of the right
Whereas the left parties are 3/4 led by men

I would like to give thanks to System of a Down for informing me about this when I was younger

Ah yes, the "undemocratic union" that Britain willingly joined and has VETO POWERS in
The "undemocratic" garbage is peddled by people who don't know the actual power structure between the union and the members
Making it "fully democratic" would also mean *giving it direct power over member countries
* But hey, if you want the EU to be like the US
> Europe had free trade agreements long before EU
Uh, no, no it didn't. The EU's predecessor was literally founded to rectify that

I'll probably just be downvoted, but this is a caricature printed in the conservative and nationalist Iranian newspaper Vatan-e-Emrooz who is aligned with and owned by fundamentalist political parties
It's not "Irans depiciton" any more than Fox News speaks for USA or The Sun speaks on behalf of the UK though
I kinda like the style of this
I should find out who the artist is and commission a painting of the prophet Muhammad
They believe he is a Vulcan
I don’t get what the Iranians have against tieflings
Irans official depiction or newspaper
That distinction matters a lot here
This drawing looks pretty good not gonna lie
Do Iranian moderates really disagree with the sentiment though
Saffron
Well, i believe there are two sides to this story, the depiction of muhammed, and regional battles for political influence in the ME
To begin with, to understand why attacks like this, Charlie Hebdo etc happen, is because in Sunni islam, its a major sacrilege to depict muhammed in any form
It doesn't matter if its a caricature or an attempt at flattery, its still some of the worst blasphemy you can do
In Shia islam, like in Iran, this isn't nearly as touchy a subject
People are allowed to paint muhammed, depict muhammed on TV etc
It's not really a huge deal
Which brings us to the political battles for influence
As in most parts of the world, the "large players" are trying to win influence in their neigboring countries
As almost the only Shia majority country in the region, Iranian politicians thus often support sunni muslims in other countries in these cases, to not look weak and lose support
So TL:DR, do moderate Iranians really care
I don't think many do
Hardliners will use any situation that can create animosity towards the west to political gain, including this one
Of course this is just my analysis of the situation
It's quite complicated
It be like that tho
make bosnia, kosovo and albania no data, and maybe put crimea back in and then you got it pretty much right
Greece good
I'm sorry my brothers, but they are never doing good
and kosovo
That's the second "X didn't tweet it, X actually said it
" non-tweet I've seen
If they have a template for it, why not make it something other than a tweet
Meanwhile, Norway is green as a summer field
We had snow in July =\]
Moscow and London were really interesting, but Prague is my personal favorite european city that I've visited
Framing something she said as a tweet seems incredibly weird to me
I get it draws more attention, but it clearly paints the wrong picture even with the text underneath IMO
I love the idea of holding politicians responsable for things they say, opinions they claim to have and promises made; as long as they are done **right**.
Well yea but thats literally illegal fake news so gg
That said, watching the proceedings lately on TV was (is
) super entertaining
Bunch of old men throwing tantrums about deals not meeting their honestly quite impossible expectations
Always a good laugh
Poor czechs and slovaks
Plus the former Yu-Gi-Oh people, I'm just going to lump you together
Brilliant, brilliant
How many damn times will this fact be reposted
Always interesting reading threads on reddit about Norway, because any positive news whatsoever is always instantly brushed off because Norway produces oil so obviously everything they do is evil and news like this doesn't matter
Half the comments in this thread have nothing to add other than "whatever, doesn't count, they still produce oil".  Hot takes right there, fellas
Like, what is it that you expect
Norway produces oil so they should just lean into it and be a record-breaking global polluter
As long as some of the industry is dirty then any green policies are apparently pointless
Now I just have to wait 7-8 years to get a cheap 2020 second hand electrical car
Fuck Musk
This is so last year news
How many time is it gonna get posted
Every time it's posted, there's these same comments
Oil, subsidies, hypocrites, oil, bla bla
We spent a lot, or rather lost a lot of govt income through taxes and fees that fossil cars are subject to
Denmark had a similar scheme, which they abolished
Over night, [EV car sales plummeted
Ehh
There is no marked for second-hand electric cars since it's too expensive to repair them
You don't get any subsidies on replacement parts or work
That means it's cheaper to buy a new car than replacing as example the battery in the old one
In short electric cars are use-and-throw away just like regular batteries and other short lived electrical equipment
Just dump it in a fjord and buy a new one
It's much cheaper than trying to find that one battery connector that's corroded from all the salt we use on the winter roads
In Norway there are luckily charging stations on every petrol station and parking garages
Seen this a bit too much lately
I don't remember who it was, but someone once commented that Norway is like the dealer who doesn't touch his own goods
Over 95% of the energy we use ourselves comes from hydro
So we can pat ourselves on the back and pretend like our emissions aren't high because exported energy doesn't count as energy used in the country of origin
Oh the obligatory "they export oil, so they cant be green" comment
Do you always bring up bad news on posts that mention good news from a country
At least we didn't eff up like Canada did with their oil
Then transition offshore petroleum industry over to massive offshore sea wind so Europe can charge their coming Evs fleets on green energy exports
>And they pay for these subsidies
Uh, they don't. Norway just *doesn't tax it
Ye, thanks for buying our oil
It is possible to rent ICE cars (or swap with a friend) for the times you actually need it instead of letting the occasional long distance trip dictate your daily driving
They are hard to repair because they are new -- this is not really specific to electrics
What is specific to electrics is that repairs and spare parts are taxed higher than new vehicles, making repairs artificially more expensive
Couple that with arbitrary rules from insurance companies stating that if the repair costs more than ~60% of a new vehicle, it must be scrapped, no matter the risk of the repair -- e.g. if one expensive but easy to replace part is broken (an example was given in the article that you cite), and everything is fine, the car will be scrapped (no matter the type of motor)
U jelly
>  exported energy doesn't count as energy used in the country of origin
yes, who has to carry the burden, the heroin user or the afghan farmer ?
Also, the Kyoto Protocol agreed to the emissions should be calculated this way
The burden should fall on the end user and not the producer
Small economies with big coal export should not be affected by the emissions when they are not the end user
That would be green washing rich countries that use coal for heat and electric production
Like this if a country with 200 000 inhabitants exported coal to Germany and then get the CO2 emissons from both producing the coal and the burning of coal in Germany
Would that be considered "fair" ?
No no no, it can't be equated to a direct cost
Simply because if the tax exemption wasn't there then a lot of people would buy a less expensive car or not buy a car at all
Which is why we should invest more in green technologies to find solutions that can help the world as a whole use less oil, instead of finding new places to pump it up
Not saying that it should necessarily count as an emission here, but that Norway and other countries with a lot of oil and gass export should take some responsibility
For example not opening up for oil searching close to the Arctic circle
But instead using more money on developing green tech that can take over for oil in the future
The world doesn't run on doritos
The world still ***NEEDS*** oil
What is your plan then, besides being smug about it
Norway is using its wealth responsibly and investing in green tech thst will help end fossil fuel dependence
What are most other oil producers doing
Correct
Nah, we handled it very well
By looking at some countries you can see how it can be a blessing or a curse
But again, how come pretty much all "frozen irrelevant countries" is richer than Portugal
Not everyone has oil, but they are still better off
Well, technically you can't because then you would have to export the car from Norway, and pay VAT in the country of import
We're still talking about expanding oil searching to the arctic though (the government is, anyway)
Yes, we are investing in green tech, but we should be doing *more* of that, instead of going "oooh let's see if there's oil in a place with a vulnerable eco system so far from any land that stopping an oil spill that could spread around the globe will be impossible, yay"
Indeed - it would be cheaper if it is older tough
When we imported our ancient (non-electric) car from France to Norway, we had to document it's value (about 4k euros IIRC) and VAT was added on top of that
And I guess it should also have been possible to get back some of the VAT from France
I think everyone fully agrees that bikes are more environmentally friendly than EVs, however that's not really the same discussion as piston-power VS electric power
Regenerative breaking, the engine brakes and thus recharges the battery
I doubt your diesel BMW gets 1100 km of range on the Autobahn
Ye, so what about countries like Sweden
They are frozen and dont have oil or a so called "golden egg". Still better off than Portugal
How is that
I'm not sure how it works, but as you export something from country A I'd hope you can have back the VAT on the current value of the item
High tech solution

So a few things to learn from this; buy fans now while you still can
And we are gonna be doomed
... Holy shit
I genuinely thought it was only some cities on the Norwegian southwest coast due to a warmer than usual Gulf stream
That is fucking bonkers
This is inaccurate, it has been below -5 atleast here all February, mostly -15 to -30
Map says it's +5
It was freezing here two days ago
(Nordland, Norway)
when i was a kid, about 12-14 years ago, i remember snowy winters on my home island
now it’s rain and dead grass
in the 60’s through 80’s you could literally skate or ski over the sea to the lighthouse, now it never even slightly freezes over
Right now its -13 celsius ìn northern norway but some days it can go up to -30
Western Norway and the leaves have started springing
Not that it's usually *that* cold here, but it's pretty crazy
Is that Celsius or Fahrenheit
Trick question
-40 Celsius and -40 Fahrenheit is the same temperature
This is so greek I like it

Yes, it's very beneficial for the west with a democratic Russia
But as always the west (or more precisely the US) had to cock it up with their foreign policy
If they dint meddle in the 1996 Russian election and helped Yeltsin win
There would a good chance that Russia would not be the oligarch state it is now
Top level unintended irony

Smooth brain is my new favorite insult
To add to what you said: Growing up in a small town in Norway, I remember a few individuals I went to school with that expressed blatant racism, and some even became neo-Nazis
What they all had in common was that none of them achieved well in school, sports, or in social relations
They were the kids that the other kids made fun of
I get that my own experience is a particular case, and not universally applicable
However, it is important
to attempt acknowledge and understand what leads to such radicalization, whether it being neo-nazism, islamism or other, to be able to combat it effectively
It's not in times of prosperity we normally see uprisings of extremists
Hitler was lawfully elected to power by people going through difficult times
Unemployment combined with a sense of national shame, and latent xenophobia provided excellent growth conditions for his wacked ideology
Thank you
Thank goodness France dodged this bullet
Would have been dissapointed if one of the many countries who witnessed the horrors of nationalism from the second world war would allow a nationalist into the highest office of their country
Thank goodness, we've had enough bad news the last year or so
Not likely to happen
Politicians like to use climate change as a source for additional income, since it is easier to gain political support for taxes on something that pollutes than for instance income
Then they use that tax income on vote-winners like for instance welfare
It's about carrots and sticks, and politicians prefer to use the stick since it gives them more money to spend, while they still can claim that they are doing something, even though it is not that effective - and more likely to drain people of money than accomplish real change
Trains and railways are en extremely expensive and long term investment
New rails especially high speed, take decades to build after they're planned
On top of that there's a side argument for the destruction of nature and impact (double meaning) on wild life
All in all those shouldn't be an argument as its a net positive, but
I'm surprised it has worsened
What did people believe was different (better) before the pandemic
The source is literally on the image
I talked to a Polish person who had not heard about the riots in the US
This was about a week or two after it all started
Which I found really surprising because it had been front page news in Norway every day since it started
(It was obviously not front page news in Poland
I suspect some people simply weren't aware of some of the problems the US has been facing or at least the scale of those problems, or didn't give them much thought
A crisis often reveals a person's or a nation's true nature, and this crisis has done so more than most
So, for instance, the average European was probably aware that income inequality was an issue in the US, but seeing images of long lines of people waiting for charity from food banks just days after losing their jobs hammered home just how many Americans are living on the brink of economic disaster
Similarly, most Europeans know that American health care is expensive, but the response to the pandemic has revealed both the lack of any central cooperation or planning (there really is no such beast as The American Health Care System) and the emphasis on maximizing profits above all other concerns
And, of course, if you believed the partisan divide in the US wasn't as bad as people claim, it's hard to continue believing that when people argue about basic public health measures as partisan issues
For the record: I grew up in the US and I still have family and friends there
I am deeply worried about the current situation
but not surprised
You are probably right
Personally I am not surprised by any of it, but I have probably looked into things more than the average European
Public health care and all citizens having access to a dignified life (i.e good welfare programs) are close to my heart
And yes
I am worried too
I have both friends and family in the US
Just out of interest I checked where Poland is on the word press freedom index
Poland rank as number 62
For comparison Romania rank as number 42, USA: 45, and there are at least 4 African countries with better ranking compared to Poland

Overcorrection thirty-odd years later
It's only loosely related to what we talked about further up
But could maybe help explain why a more full picture is not seen on their front pages
Well
while the "are democrats left-wing or not" discussion is a whole own thing, the difference is probably more that you can be socially liberal and/or economically liberal
The former is associated with the left (and I suppose libertarianism) because it's in natural opposition with conservatism, the latter with the right because
well, it by and large lets rich people and corporations do whatever they want
The "yee haw, them dern librulz" brand of "liberal" is just that the Americans, characteristically, decided to use the term to mean something else than most of the rest of the world

there’s a difference between seperatism and ukraine wanting to remain ukraine and not become a part of russia
>there’s a difference between seperatism and donetsk wanting to remain donetsk and not become a part of ukraine
only 38% of donetsk are ethnic russians
according to surveys only 23% of Donbass (the two seperatist republics) actually want independance or union with russia
the referendums of independance were definetly tampered
donetsk is ukranian, and wants to be, seperatists don’t represent the 100% of the population
>Oh, don't tell me that you are on the Assad side in syrian conflict
This is just another horrible example of what can go wrong when a government responds to separatism movement with oppressive force
The isis raise and feeds on the people anger against the central government
i never said i was, i’m in support of democracy and rule of law, isis is horrible and assad is not any good either
my point is a government has to draw the line of free speech somewhere, you can’t allow everything under freespeech
Imprisoned because of writings, or because they broke the law
he was imprisoned on charges, he was charged with espionage by the US and detained by the UK who have an extrafition bill with the US
it’s definetly not fair and it’s censorship and political injustice
basically there were charges, unfair charges but charges non the less
There was some news a year ago about how a Polish truck driver had been arrested here after driving drunk for nearly 5 miles on the highway before being pulled over
First thing that came to my mind is how this would never happen with a Norwegian truck driver, since they would crash after 500 meters
Why should she be more immune to being peppersprayed than you
Is that fair
So the police is held accountable
Seems like it works fine then
Not here in Norway
Then again, we spend a lot of resources on police training, you have to take a 3 year bachelor's degree to become police, and it's regarded as a job carrying a certain status
If you only recruit dumb and angry people to be police, you get dumb and angry police
Why should the government be able to attack you for standing up to them lawfully
Beeecaause figuring out problems is fun
Finding solutions and creating new stuff is incredibly satisfying

You know, every now and then some Norwegian historians dress up as vikings, make a longship and sails to Lindisfarne
this entertains me
Won't do it again
(We're still proud of it, though, for some reason)
They had it coming, leaving their gold and silver unguarded like that
Do keep in mind that this is basically propaganda
(If the literal dragons weren't a hint)
A bit of both probably
They often formed groups from many different countries when they traveled, picking up crew in lots of places
Lots of triggered danes in the comments here
Danes always take credit whenever historians say "Norwegian or Danish". Same with the origin of Rollo
[Rome was built on rape
It was par on course for how society used to be*, hell pirates are children's entertainment today
You don't think they ever raped
^^^*Maybe ^^^still ^^^is
It could be based on the "newly" found "viking age" that happened 3000 years ago, during the bronze age, where they most likely had helmets with horns
It's mentioned in Norwegian here:
As you can see on these petroglyphs, the men are depicted using helmet with horns:
Heh
Seriously though
They had been trading with the british isles for thousands of years before that according to the physical evidence
Same could be said of Norway
Ottar of Hålogaland, who explored much of the known world in the 9th century, said to Alfred the Great when he visited Wessex that when he sailed from his home in (Lofoten) Hålogaland, down south along the coast until he came to Skiringssal, a trade center in the current Viken county around the Oslofjord, said to the king that the land from all along the coast from the north and to Viken and beyond was "Nordvegr" or the Northern way, and along the fjords and inside the country was where the "Northmen" (Nordmenn) lives
So there was definitely an idea of Norway too
Harald Fairhairs idea to become king of Norway had to come out of somewhere
This was in the late 9th century, so idk how it was in 793, but probably not much different
Yeah, having rape as their genesis story
Surely a good look
I always thought that was a made up name (from a childrens song), its a weird word

Well, unless he gets banned, which he should have been a long time ago, I bet that he will still tweet
I don't know, I guess I'm gonna miss the madness
You can do the same in any country where enough votes are counted for the loser to be mathematically eliminated
At the very least he has solid competence in running a nation

You cant really call him democratically elected
Not all the senators were democratically elected, Amidala and Jar Jar for instance, were both appointed by non-democratic leaders, not a democratic vote
And even the ones who were, we know Palatine had corrupted, blackmailed and  manipulated to be loyal to him, not the people
But not all of those senators were democratically elected
Both Jar Jar and Amidala was appointed by leaders who were not themselves democratically elected
Honestly surprised Norway is just 37%. Feels like all we have is forests
This is totally unfair
Everyone knows trees don't grow above the tree line
Can confirm, I grew up in northern Norway and our summer vacations when I was a kid consisted of driving around the northern parts of Sweden and Finland, if I never see a tree again it'll be too soon
The only cool thing I remember was driving through the woods in Finland and then suddenly the two lane road widened to like 12 lanes or something ridiculous like that for a couple of kilometers, I think it was so that they can land airplanes there in times of crisis
Nice map
I'd love to see one but % of man-made object/city coverage
A lot of mountains, and parts of the country are far enough north that trees don't grow properly
Imagine the planet Hoth, but with summer months as well
Much of Norway is like Hoth
Also trees don't grow in the fjords
And if the the bottom of a Norwegian walley is not a fjord, it's a river, then the rest of the flat areas are farmland
Only the sides are forest, go to high and you reach Hoth again

I seriously doubt this would ever be an issue if we in the West just took it slow and relied on the East to change on their own accord instead of telling them to

No stop this, everything in Russia is poor and depressive
People hate their life in every town and all the cities are old Soviet blocks
Well gender discrimination can happen on both sides
Sadly the laws are causing discrimination
I hope they change some day
Well blind people have a privilege
They don’t see race or gender
Maybe we all should be blind about those things
So true equality can happen

Virkelig
I Norge ser det ut som at det motsatte har skjedd overalt i befolkningen, politikken og media
Nå i disse tider med valget og Capitol angrepet, har det dog betydelig blitt mer USA nyheter, men generelt sett har vårt samfunn i Norge drevet lenger vekk fra alt amerikansk de siste 10-15 årene — med unntak fra underholdning
It's so annoying how fascism is often the path of least resistance for people's opinions

While fascism gives you all the supposed answers
It makes me angry just thinking about it
Do you ever go to other posts than the immigration ones
In any other politcal topic the sub is generally on the left
This seems surprisingly difficult to grasp for many people
Then check any other topic than immigration
There are more than a single factor to indicate where someone is on the political axis
Maybe the guy who wants more taxes for the rich, more welfare, less privatization, more nationalization of services, strict immigration, a greener power grid, less authoritarianism and more LGBT friendly policies is not far-right, who knows
Or are we LARPing as Americans again where we pretend there's only two political parties and embrace polarization because it seems to work out so well over there
So, what happens to Mann
So Celtic basically no one properly speaks a Celtic language there but many do in Wales and France(Brittany) lol
Yes either Wales or Brittany(in France) alone has more native speakers of a Celtic language than the two Irelands and Scotland put together
Scotland is about as Celtic as England proper at this point
The Gaelic Republic
i think they look rather nice
Doesn't make sense given how they speak a Celtic language and the Faroe Islands speak a North Germanic language related to Icelandic and Norwegian
If anything, now the Faroe Islands belongs to us again ;)
Pffft

My grandma had tuberculosis as a kid and was hospitalized for years because of it, so I'm glad we all got the vaccine back then but I'm a little surprised we've stopped by now
It was mandatory up until 1995 for all children to get it, until 2009 it was part of the teen vaccine program, and now it is only mandatory if your parents are from an area with active infections
Apparently there are still about 300 yearly cases of TB in Norway, so it's not completely gone here either
All treatment and vaccines related to the disease is free here because it is considered a hazard to the whole public
So if you have a reason to you can still get the vaccine
I didn't know until I read your comment and looked it up that we have dropped it as part of standard vaccines

At least they let us know they can

That stuff being allowed in the US is a travesty and an embarrassment
I don't think that is how politics work
"Ok, today we are voting for these 2 billion, those who want cancer treatment say aye, those who want television say nay". Every time you delegate money for anything, the opposition will say you take it from the worst possible alternative
Funding the army
Now you take the money from schools
Funding the police
Now it's taking money from hospitals
Funding hostpitals
That's taking money from international relief
How does China fit in there
Yeah but China has some of the smartest leaders, they're entirely different than the US
If you compare it to the [Norwegian parliament] it's not that far off
Comparison to your "parties":
Rødt - Socialism
SV - Socialism
AP (the rose) - Labour
Senterpartiet - Centrism is exciting (or What about the districts
MDG - Thunberg (they will get a lot more seats next election)
KrF - Christians who (mostly) aren't bible-thumpers
Venstre - Liberalism
Høyre - Liberal and conservative at the same time
FrP - Covert racists
This is pretty accurate tbh
i mean, it’s not that wierd
it’s just the US who are very right wing, but has still managed to drive a hard border between two very similar ideologies
SV - Socialistic Left
Venstre - Liberal and conservative at the same time
Høyre - Covert racists
Frp - Overt racists
Edit: People are apparently offended by this comment
The comment I replied to used "Liberalism
" for Venstre, which wasn't one of the options in the OP
I changed it around to only use descriptions from OP
Venstre is IMO best suited for the "liberal and conservative at the same time" moniker
You can fight me on that if you want, but they've really lost their liberalism way in this government
Calling Høyre covert racists is a bit tongue in cheek, but the way they cooperate with the overt racists in Frp (like Listhaug) to have them be the racist face of the government is why I put it there
It's all supposed to be in good fun, right
Feel free to suggest alternate descriptions, but you're not allowed to use "liberal and conservative at the same time" for both Venstre and Høyre
I don't think so
The one above is pretty accurate
I'm sure Americans would classify even the right spectrum of Norwegian politics as socialism
Nah, Høyre is definitely liberal (in the actual meaning of the word) and conservative, and FrP kicked out the overt racists
Demokratene are the overt racists
Edit to your edit: Venstre doesn't really fit with any of the categories, and the same with AP, which is why I didn't use the terms OP supplied for those two
Høyre is definitely not racist
FRP; yeah, they've got a couple of somewhat racist moments
Parties like Alliansen, Demokratene, Selvstendighetspartiet and others on the far, far right though; are definitely overtly racist
For those not familiar with Norwegian politics, it might interest them to know that the Democrats, here described as "overtly racist", has an Iranian-born Kurd as its current party leader
([relevant link]
Yeah, but they're not in Parliament
See my edit for my rationale
How is that relevant
And do you think it's any better to be covert racists than overt racists
While I believe it, Demokratene, Liberalistene, and Alliansen are filled with racists POS
Have you guys had similar new parties pop up the last few years

I greatly enjoy that this is drawn without land/ocean borders, which serves to emphasise just how important coastlines are
Similarily you find that inland, population density tends to follow rivers
For Norway at least I guess it's because it's a big country with a fairly small population and a fair amount of people still live very spread out in small villages and such
Also mountains
That is because the size of your country equals only one of our counties (fylke)
Mountains, islands and fjords
That's Norway

Many comments on this post are so strange
Biden is just making a symbolic gesture to show that he will try to be less of a dick than Trump, they are not trying to crown him emperor of the EU or something that some seem to want to portray it as
Did they not have an adult sized chair for Biden
Might be the only one who cares, but why is the US attending an EU summit
The EU went to war in Iraq
It's just a symbolic gesture

Arnold talked about this in an interview
He got caught trying to sneak back into the base, and the higher-ups were very angrily talking about how they were going to punish him
When the brass realized he'd won the competition they saw the PR opportunity of "glorious Army discipline helps you achieve your goals", so they ended up "punishing" him by putting him on kitchen duty where for the first time in his life he got access to protein every day

They're leaders of the EU and effectively most of Europe
That's a man (Michel) and woman ([**von der Leyen**] respectively
As for Merkel, she's respected by many Europeans, but she's hated by a tiny minority of extremists

It's not meant literally though
Though he would "steal" it away from the people who made it (Germans), and keep it for his own
If it happened early enough, it might have
Was probably too late by the time they had 40% of the vote
Hitler being thrown into prison is a very good example of the state being too lenient with and sympathetic to the Nazis
Hitler spent 9 months in prison for a *coup attempt*, and many of his accomplices weren't punished at all
Versailles *was* set up to fuck over Germany, but I'd ask you to consider how harsh Versailles was when compared to the peace settlement after WW2
There certainly wasn't any Nazi party then (though there were still Nazis who were conveniently ignored everywhere, but that's another matter)
Hell, there wasn't any *Germany* for a few years
I don't really buy the idea that something is inevitable in history
The rise of the Nazis has many reasons, and it could have been stopped
The Nazis might have found some other way into power, but it would have cost them more than it did historically if they weren't handed power by the Conservatives (who foolishly thought they could control Hitler)
The Army, while no progressive force by any means, was not in the pocket of the Nazis until the Nazis were in power
Any new coup attempt would give the Nazis less legitimacy, even if they managed to avoid civil war
Oh no the country we invaded is fighting back, how horrible

I can confirm that, as a Norwegian, we see the USA as a great country that just doesn’t act like it
*sorts by controversial*

Sierra Leone, Myanmar and Congo are some
Ironic that r/the_donald is quarantined

Yesterday someone posted on r/norge about being a student stuck in panicking New York not knowing what to do
They seemed genuinely frightened
I think if I was in their shoes it would feel somewhat ensuring to read that post by the NTNU, especially after getting tickets home
I get what you mean though, it seems like an unneccessary low blow to the US healthcare and politics, however I actually think the positives outweight the negatives by writing it like that
What is there to be envious about
The US is very powerful, but what good does that do when the power is not spent improving the lives of its citizens
Sure, but how many students at NTNU is in the US compared to Myanmar, Congo and Sierra Leone
>  If you have good health insurance
Well, that's the problem right there
I agree
You don't really think about something you've taken for granted all your life (free healthcare at home)
It's one thing to have "insurance" in the US and another to actually have *sufficient* insurance coverage and end up at the right hospital (without out of network charges)
You can still end up paying a lot even with insurance
Except it's not even a low blow, it's just
how things are
It's information for people who need to hear it
USA is a pretty bad place to be stuck right now

Still enough parking

Oh you don't know Scandinavian car culture
Thing's crazy here, the government is pushing the same kind of BS here and it's resulted in pretty much a straight up war between car enthusiasts and the state
In my town they gather in the thousands up by our local mall to tear up the asphalt every now and then to protest against the new car regulations and the cops who enforce it
As a result, the entire commercial area gets shut down and the entrances get blocked with heavy machinery if the cops hear someone talking about an upcoming "rånetreff" as we call it here
It's mad
Nope Oslo people hate it
Or maybe
At least a vocal minority voting for the right nationalist party do
Even here in Oslo some people complain like crazy
And then they remove even more parking spaces and put up more tolls, and the rest of us laughs

I'm not sure it's pettiness as much as it is practicality or even just style
West Berlin was an enclave of another country at the time, and the borders definitely weren't open, so what would be the point in adding it on that map
I've seen other maps with similar style, and as far as I can remember, they only show what they're "supposed" to show, so if it's a map of a specific region, you get these borders around the region with everything outside being void
It's not even a funny one, stimme zu

[Just did a couple of side-by-sides] comparing the old and new Oslo
Not exact, as I had to get the modern pictures from Google Streetview
A few thoughts and questions from a 42 year old guy living in Oslo:
- First of all, that is Henrik Ibsen caught in the wild
The only thing more spectacular would be a paparazzi photo of Shakespeare
- Lots of tipping the hat and smiling
I don't want to make this into a m'lady meme, but Oslo could really need some of that type of friendliness back in fashion
- Some of the pictures if not most seam to have been taken on 17th of May
It really looks like people have dressed up for our national holiday
I'm not sure if the pictures represent average people in Oslo during that time or if this is mostly people who have dressed up for this occasion
The flag carrier gives it away
But you can also see people wearing traditional bow, girls in the traditional "bunad" and flags at full mast
It might be another special occasion and the pictures might be from many different days, but my immediate thought was that many if not most of the pictures was from this celebration
- Oslos main/parade street (Karl Johan) has not changed too much since these pictures were taken
The Parliament and the Kings Castle are still the same places, and most of the surroundings buildings look the same
- All the women are using umbrellas to block out the sun
That something you have to travel to Asia to see today
:-D
That's over a hundred years ago, and I still manage to recognise both places and people
That's kinda cool
I believe there is quite a few photos from 17th May celebrations, the Norwegian Constitution Day
In particular [#24,] [#33] and [#53
] There could be more, which would explain some of the nice clothing
But I doubt he had enough film in his camera for it only to be from that celebration
He even managed to take a photo of Henrik Ibsen (the most played playwright in the world after Shakespeare)
Wow, I love this
I just love seeing photos from back then in the 19th century
How life was and how the world was
Much different from now, but humans haven't changed a bit
It's fun to think about
As a Norwegian, seeing Oslo like this was kind of cool
A lot of buildings and roads still look exactly the same today
Also, is that Ibsen at #48
This is so interesting
What strikes me is how new Oslo looks
You can tell it's not like major European capitals like London or Paris back then, everything is very neat and fresh; like it's just being built
Also funny how [this] picture is taken in the exact heart of Oslo, that's the Royal castle in the background, and the spot where the photographer is standing is in the middle of Karl Johan, one of the biggest and busiest streets in the city today
Most of the pictures have either the castle, the university or the parliament in the background, so apart from the ones taken on boats or on what looks like vacations in cabins or something, he took most of them in an area of only a few blocks around where he attended school
This can't be Norway, people are smiling and greeting a stranger

And this was in rural Norway even
> most of the surroundings buildings look the same
Yes, most of them, but not all of them
Thankfully, the plans to change the area were not implemented (when building the Parliament, new courthouse, etc)
In the 1950s or so they wanted to make it a highway
> Oslos main/parade street (Karl Johan) has not changed too much since these pictures were taken
The Parliament and the Kings Castle are still the same places, and most of the surroundings buildings look the same
Actually it have changed substantially
I would guess that least three quarter of the buildings along the street have either been significantly altered to the unrecognizable or been demolished since these pictures were taken
Even the small part of it shown in these pictures have gotten these new buildings:
- [The Tostrup building]
- [Lille Grensen 7]
- [Grand Hotel]
- [Karl Johans gate 33]
- [Karl Johans gate 45]
It kinda looked like most of the pictures was just him bumming around outside the University, so a lot of them probably were people he knew
It has changed *a little* to be fair
The areas in the photos look pretty much the same today
I live in Oslo
But a novel like "Hunger" would not make much sense today, we are not the poorest country in Europe anymore
I saw Ibsen, Birkleand and [Sophus Lie] (my mathematical hero along with [Niels Henrik Abel]
Da må du komme deg ut på bygda

Most of the pictures are taken around the university in Oslo, where the photographer was a student, so many of them are probably people he knew
Here you go: [Stirn Concealed Vest Camera]
It's the Norwegian flag with the Norwegian-Swedish union mark
In use between 1844 and 1899
> studentmossa
Hey, hey, we didn't speak Swedish
Student cap, *studenterhue* in Danish, would be something like *studenterlue* in Norwegian at the time
[Duskelue
I used to have one of those
These streets [are very walkable today] and exclusively pedestrian :)
Yes, absolutely, it would be just another "dialect" to us
>  You can tell it's not like major European capitals like London or Paris back then
Eh, have you heard of [Paris and Haussmann] before
Oh, that's my old school
University of Oslo on Karl Johan street in Oslo city center
A lot of the old, beautiful stuff was destroyed here too
It just happens to be that a) These pictures were mostly taken before they were built and b) they were taken at different places to where the destroyed buildings once stood
The area around Karl Johan (which is where these pictures were taken) is well preserved, but it is a different story outside of it
Examples of buildings that have gone lost:
- [Det Engelske Kvarter]
- [Hasselgården]
- [Tollbugata 23]
- [Sjømandshjemmet]
- [Drammensveien 2]
- [The whole Stortorvet building row]
> The first cell phone call was made in 1985
You're off by about 40 years
The first mobile phone is from 1949
The first fully automated system is the Swedish MTA, dated 1956, and the first  multinational mobile network is NMT, which opened in 1981
Ibsen is in one of the photos
He is at least 128 if you do the math
Fremmedfolk som prater til meg

We pretend it never happened
Norway was damaged by WWI
The economy took [a real dip (historical GDP, change in percent)
Food in general was in short supply and got more expensive, as the Germans sunk Norwegian trade ships
Imports were crucial and our merchant fleet was one of the world's largest
The British pressured Norway to became the "neutral ally" and Germany responded in kind
A total of 847 ships were sunk, more than 1150 sailors died
People did not starve to death, but securing the food supply was a priority
Rationing was introduced
Inflation was runaway
The shipping magnates got rich, while ordinary people suffered
Yes, I know
I was just saying it's interesting to see it in these pictures
Yeah, but far from all on Karl Johan
Exactly
I know you're joking, but we weren't Swedish :D We practically spoke Danish in Oslo at that time
Even though *nynorsk* and *riksmål* were up and coming by the 1890s.
Curiously, the 1920s revision of our Constitution was written in what seemed almost Danish to us now
You should probably read your source more carefully
That was the first _UK commercial network_.  NMT operated commercially in Scandinavia way before that
Quoting your own source:
> It wasn’t even the first cellular service, the Nordics had NMT as early as 1981 and AT&T had launched AMPs in Chicago in 1983, but the UK launch was massively significant, although even Vodafone and Cellnet didn’t realise it at the time
Hehe, ok, I hear you Danes have trouble discerning between spoken Swedish and Norwegian, but I didn't think it included written ;)
Some of these posts have been somewhat low effort, glad to see some good quality ones being made

Why is it that our only hope is this or the other dicator's death

People being mortal is cool and all, but it's slow to wait for them to die
Take care
We all know the real reason Norway didn't join the EU was because they wanted to make Sweden and Finland look like a pair of cock and balls
what else can I say, except you're welcome
Sweden is such a dick
Sweden and Finland gonna get some cock n ball torture
Damn straight EU
These are the most depressing comments I have seen on this sub in a long while
I get that people don't like her party but Jesus christ that doesn't mean you have to pretend Xi is not a fucking dictator
They are already here
Isn't that a map on Gran Turismo 5
Look at that noob, opening the door like that
At least they get snow
The national broadcasting service in Norway did an article on the effects of global warming we could already see in my country
A tragic article, this gif would probably go in a similar article for Austria
Wow that's a ton of snow
I agree with your tag, also it didnt snow here in december and it hasnt snowed yet in January
Near haugesund, how about it
Trondheim just got snow today this sunday
Var veldig mye snøfall i dag og skal jeg si deg

I'm supposed to move back to the Netherlands from Norway
All my stuff is already there
I'm stuck and I have no idea for how long
I can quarantine
Test requirement not available from here
I'm stuck and unemployed where I am now, couch surfing
Granted, it's covid-safe where I am and I get benefits
I guess I could force my way through, with a stiff test and hotel budget in a place where I would actually be at risk of catching it, with no guarantee that the country is not locked up by the time I'm there
I have the sense that the Netherlands will not lift this deterrent to travel before April or May
This has been many of the threads over at /r/Norway the last year
Amazing that people don't understand that travelling during a pandemic is a bad idea
There's now a two test requirement
Test 1: not available where I am (an arctic island)
I'd have to fly to the capital (Oslo) which is currently under supa dupa strict lockdown, and where I'd actually have a risk of catching it
Test 2: cannot find information about it
Flight connections are also pretty bad these days and involve going through Denmark, which is also trying to deter everyone
There's a real risk of going to Oslo and being stuck there for a few weeks due to a new regulation, being denied boarding, having to buy 1000€ last minute tickets
We are also not taking the government advice lightly: do not come
Do not travel unnecessarily
Don't go to Oslo
Don't leave your municipality
The problem is that very few of us can draw like this
But I like your drawing
The amount of ignorant amerikkkans on this thread

All I want for Christmas is being able to go in the "non-eu citizen" line at European airports

Bro, 3 degrees
Spring is finally on its way
It's crazy how fast the temperature changes
Last week I was freezing on my eyes when I blinked because we had like -15 degrees in Norway and bow I don't even need my jacket outside
Honestly scary
2 weeks ago we had like 2 meters of snow and -15 degrees, now most of the snow is gone and it's like 5 degrees
Almost a 30 degree change in temperature in a little over a week
To be fair, guys from mountain regions tend to have a pretty flexible opinion on when it's warm enough to wear shorts
Holy shit is **the** DickRhino
Thats's right
What people need to understand is that the other US presidents are equally bad or worse
Take Obama as an example just because he is so well liked: opened the arctic to oil drilling, currently goes around bragging about he's the one who did fracking, took the US from two armed conflicts to seven (one of them Libya), expanded the surveillance state and aggressively prosecuted whistleblowers under the espionage act - which in turn made the US drop 29 spots in the press freedom rankings by reporters without borders, admitted people were tortured - only to go on and say he would held no one responsible because it was "behind them now and it's about looking forward", built the cages on the border, deported more people than Trump etc
But it's all fine because he did them politely
I fear it will be the same with Mr
Biden
(who btw not only voted for the Iraq war, but actively shamed those who didn't)
Trump was just a symptom, the rot runs deep
it’s easier to plan with china, but it’s morally wrong
He is a glory to Europe
Resisting nazis and dictatorships
And I don't blame them either

Never smelt surstrømming or lutefisk irl
I am scared

They don't sink themself
It's just that they're afraid of oil tankers and pretends to be submarines when they get close to one
Not very practical in Norwegian waters though
Example: Blucher going to Oslo when there was a lot of traffic
>Never smelt lutefisk
Please turn in your passport at your local police station at your earliest convenience
Ikke glem Sverige
At the start of WWII, Britian was critically lacking SMGs, and bought Thompsons from USA
According to [this] source, a Thompson costed $209 to produce in 1939, and $70 in 1942
A Sten-gun costed $11 in 1942 (~$130 today with inflation)
The Sten required only around 5 man-hours to produce
Additional fun fact, the BAR costed $319 to produce in 1945, while the StG44 costed $26 in 1944
Important to note that it's not a perfect comparison, due to the complexities of the different economies of the nations, but it does show how much cheaper stamping is compared to milling in an arms production context
Here is the thing, my parents are vegetarian and I have never had the oppertunity to try lutefisk
Willing to try it though
Unnskyld, det er en meget smuk sandkasse

Always impressive when houses that old are still standing

A trial would yield the same result, and the partisans had already reached the verdict
It was bad that it happened that way, but considering far greater evils played out every day in that place at that time I think it would be unfair to say the partisans were any more wrong in their ways than anyone else
alot of people always trashtalks these "commieblocks" but i think it actually looks really nice
like, as long as the area is nice, i have no problem
But russia bad, no
Honestly don’t have a problem with brutalist architecture if done properly
It can look relatively clean and minimalistic while also saving costs and providing housing to more people per dollar
the purpose they served was to promote urbanisation, and therefore industrialisation, as suddenly there were large amounts of cheap urban housing
commieblocks aren’t exclusive to wartorn countries, there’s many in sweden and norway for example
i agree, those suburbs are so boring, they look plastic and fake
at least these look real and not like you live in a barbiedoll house
yeah, definetly agree
i’ll just copypaste a comment from earlier (subject is american suburbs)
>i agree, those suburbs are so boring, they look plastic and fake
at least these look real and not like you don’t live in a barbiedoll house
i guess that comes with it not being while under s capitalist system, because even though i believe capitalism is better communism, capitalists often will sacrifice quality because it’s cheaper and easier
It has annoyed me for the LONGEST time that America is the role model for the entire western world

It's worse in Australia – right now there's a case going on about the willful destruction of an Australian Aboriginal site of major cultural and archeological importance by a massive coal company that isn't even Australian iirc and yet people are protesting about *American* politics because apparently the politics of America matter more than the politics of our own fucking country and the people who are actually being targeted here
There are literally 10 people on the photo

Haven't used them in the streets before but they are my favourite way to take a piss at festivals

These are actually great
By far my favorite festival urinal design
Good privacy, yet good ventilation and small footprint means there is never any (male) toilet queue whenever these bad boys have been deployed, and no need to hold your breath usually either
10/10 would piss again
These are usually used in festivals around here
Freedom of speech is the freedom to not be censored by the state/goverment
Universities in the UK are, if i remember correctly, independent of the state
So it is not impeding freedom of speech, it is just being cunts
Looks more like it fell down on it's own
If it had been purposefully removed by the university I would've expected them to not leave all that trash behind
Yeah, that was posted after my comment

I'm assuming, at risk of coming off as language racist, that the Saudi Arabian flag literally has a word or phrase on it, so it would be kind of like having the British Flag read "God Save the Queen" and a crown on a red background

You forgot to mention the woman is not just a random nobody, she is an author of children's books and a local politician in Stovner, a part of Oslo (our capital) representing the party SV (Socialist Left in english)

I don't know, but I don't think anything will happen, she backtracked immediately, deleting the tweet, and deactivating her account, and while it was posted to reddit, I haven't seen any mention of it in mainstream news
If it somehow does enter into the news, she will just repeat what she tweeted while backtracking, that she didn't mean it and that it came out wrong and was totally misunderstood

Reindeer as so shaggy looking in summer
Doesn't matter how many times I've seen it, it still looks odd
This would be tame reindeer right
Wild reindeer only exist in Eastern Finland(Forest reindeer) in tiny numbers (2-5,000)and in Southern Norway(Mountain Reindeer) in larger numbers(20-50,000)
The Reindeer in the photo aren't afraid of humans either so I guess its definitely not wild reindeer
66 degrees, 30 feet north
> So hot even the mosquitoes are hiding
Come to think of it
Very few mosquitoes this year
>I live this far north in a different country, I cant understand heat like that this far north
You are surrounded by sea
I have some friends visiting family on the Faroe Islands at the moment
They are further south, but only has 13 degrees
But this is the first summer I'm jealous of them
*I’m swimming in the rain*...
Yeah this is extreme
We had a very cold early spring/late winter and now a very hot summer
Yeah it do be like that sometimes
Its perhaps the hottest place in the US when you measure both humidity and temperatures aka heat index
Texas and Florida I'd say
Its harder for humans to cope with 40 degree 55% heat in Dallas than it is to deal with 52 degree heat in Arizona or Death Valley, California
Similarly, the Arabian gulf coast has temperatures as high or higher than Arizona but the humidity of Texas
Its hell on Earth, the entire region has to be air conditioned soon
Same with Southern Pakistan and Northern India
High humidity + high desert like temperatures
Similarly, 35 degrees Celsius in Thailand or Singapore with 80% humidity is equal to the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth(57 Celsius)
A very hot day would be like 38 degrees with a humidity of 80% which equals a staggering 71 degrees Celsius
Record was 79c and was reached in Saudi Arabia
The US government says anything above a heat index of 54c is 'extreme danger, heat stroke imminent'. I lived in those temperatures in Thailand for years when I didn't have AC
Never got heat stroke, neither did the entire region who live there
I am guessing the index doesn't take into account being acclimatized
My sisters friend did have a heat stroke(I think) and collapsed in the street during a hot and humid day in Thailand
She was young and slim but wasn't acclimatized
Had to go buy a bunch of cold water from 7/11 and dunk her head in it
He turned out fine though
You get used to it but its no fun, came back to Norway during a decently warm winter(last year) and froze like hell in 23c weather, now I am acclimatized again are sweating in 30 degree weather with 40-50% humidity-_- That would be freezing to me only a year ago
In Thailand we'd wear literal winter jackets in 30c weather down there
When it got close to 25c the entire region buys winter hats and gloves etc
It looks odd as hell to see people in the tropics wear winter-jackets, gloves and hats in tropical weather but people have literally frozen to death down there in 20c weather haha
At 25c people(me included) would literally shake because of the cold, its so odd
I think you meant that they pawed way

>Critics of Article 13 have argued that there’s only one way platforms could do this: upload filters
These automatically check all uploaded content to see whether it’s copyrighted or not
If the filter detects copyrighted content – it doesn’t make it onto the platform
>But concerns have been raised about how that will work in practice
It obviously won't, because you can't check every entire work against all other entire works as part of an upload, so there are going to be lots and lots of false positives
Let alone being able to add reliable exemptions for fair use
At least this won't be implemented right away, and some countries are bound to make a mess of the process before being able to put in place a system that consistently makes a mess for everyone else
In the meantime, people need to vote for politicians and parties committed to stop and undo this
And then start working on legislation that cuts back on the existing regressive and ridiculous IP laws and regulations
Death plus 70 years, it makes no sense

Are there any active groups that want to end the centralized EU government but that still wants to keep free trade, free movement and free immigration within the EU
Because this whole huge EU state doesn't seem to be going to well
It indeed is
I hope the career of the 300+ corrupt politician that voted in favor of this end up with their career in flames
Does the law apply in the “European economic area”? Specifically Norway
And party suicide for any party that didn't at least have a large group voting against
The problem is that the UK has the likes of Theresa May in charge, and they're no more friendly to the free internet
They're even opposed to encryption
Wait, it’ll take two years to implement
We got loads of time to get them to repeal it then, right
Because of the Euro Trade Zone agreements (EØS) we have, I’m fairly sure this affects us as well
But I think we have the power to reverse the law by making an exception for it in our own copyright laws
Don't care if probably the wrong word
Most people probably don't even realise the consequences and of many that might have understood, they might have naively believed there was no way the EU was stupid enough to pass it
Maybe nothing can be done about it in the near future, but we have to start working on it if we want to be able to make positive changes in the long term
At some point the average lifespan (or at least privileged people's lifespan) is going to increase faster than copyrighted works enter the public domain
And AI tech is going to change the reality of how works are created and maintained
While wealth inequality continues to increase, and those who control the most resources will have an increasing competitive edge, or own more and more IP
We'll get it further down the line at some point
I don't trust our politicians to reject it when the two largest parties happily voted to implement the Data Retention Directive, despite it being a violation of our constitution

I want to thank Swedes for portraying Norway's resistance movement, that we are very proud of, in the Battlefield series
No wait actually it was terrible and showed no respect at all
Not officially but Norwegian fighters where left to operate fairly freely in Sweden
There was a large contingent of Norwegian refugees in Sweden and they set up organizations with  lines of communication back to the government in exile in Britain
In order to maintain their Neutrality Sweden didn't allow military operations based from their territory at first and they sometimes turned away refugees caught on the border, but the Norwegians where allowed to train a "police force" and from 1943 onward they took a more Allied friendly approach and allowed Norwegians in Sweden to train military units and even launch covert operations from Swedish territory and smuggle weapons, by the end of the war there where 14
000 Norwegian soldiers based in Sweden
Although they never saw battle they allowed the Norwegian government to swiftly move in and take custody of surrendering German troops and arrest collaborators once German forces surrendered at the end of the war
kinda but not officially
since sweden was officially neutral the government didn’t aid directly
but since they were a neutral country alot of officials fleed there, and alot of military operations ended there as they could flee there afterwards
kinda unrelated, but my great-grandfather was a resistance fighter, who kidnapped two high ranking nazis during the occupation, and was able to drag both of them with him to sweden where he waited the rest of it out

we don’t know what happened when they got to sweden, he says they were put in a norwegian prison camp or something, which is wierd
but idk
that’s what he has told us at least
and he really isn’t a boisterous type
this was the first and last ever time he spoke of his experience during the war, so i don’t see why he would lie

Norway is essentially a non-voting member of the EU (with a few exceptions), including being part of the Schengen area

Feel free to read "Erdogan" instead, but the argument still stands

I hope Le Pen doesnt win
although if Emmanuel Macron wins i hope something happens in the EU
i really like the idea of EU, but we need to do something about how it works
the hate against EU is increasing exponentially, ofcoure with the help of foreign propoganda (Russia), but still, we cant take all the non europe immigrants etc

She makes Merkel and Trump look decent
They all seem to be in a teenage drama; Trump has cheated on Melania with Putin, and Merkel, with the smug smile, told Melania about it all (what happened at the G8-summit, etc)
Macron is ready to defend Merkel if anything happens, and Brigitte is honestly just ready to see some juicy shit go down
A second later they smile and shake hands with Putin
Don’t be for this reason
Merkel and Macron miles a second or so later
Yeah, the Romanian one looked good for that reason, at least from an outsider perspective
Also the religious pictures in the other posts are something many have in their houses there, while I have some suspicion pictures of the Dutch East India company is relatively rare

She’s actually not Minister of Health, but Minister of Elders Care and Public Health
She is pretty right wing, had a short term as Minister of Legal affairs, but had to go after a Facebook post accusing the Labour Party for supporting terrorists
Totally anti Islam, climate change denier and rude as hell
Showing up with her crucifix around her neck and touting about “good old Norwegian Christian values”, spreading more hate and controversy
Sorry, truth be spoken
This is the same women that you saw on last week tonight, floating around in the Mediterranean in a big red life jacket to experience how it is to be a migrant crossing the ocean
Then she was the minister of immigration
Wonder what she's going to do now
She's also a right wing populist that was ousted through a vote of no confidence as the minister of justice after saying the opposing party AP was prioritizing terrorist lives before that of the country on facebook
Which isn't acceptable for a person in power to say
you don't need to be healthy to be a minister of health
just like you don't need to foreign affairs and be foreign
you just need to make sure the healthcare system works
she's probably more fitted for that job than any nurse
It's how it usually goes with right-wing governments everywhere
Terrible choices all around
As a Norwegian, that is pretty darn gross
I like her though, she wants people to be well informed and after that be able to make their own decisions about what they want to do without being judged for it
Her opinion is that the government shouldn't regulate what people are allowed or not allowed to do
Meget mystisk
To be fair, stand outside a hospital and you'll see countless doctors and nurses taking smoke breaks
You can see that's she's Norwegian because she's drinking Pepsi Max

Here we go again
Looking at a lot of the comments, it continuously amazes me that so many people do not know about this
It is an integral part of how the Earth has worked for billions of years and still, somehow, lots of people in the year 2020 have not heard of the concept of winters without sunrise and summers without sunset
Obviously I have a different perspective on this since I’m from a country where this occurs (though not in my area, luckily I’m too far south), but still, it just boggles my mind
We just suck it up
Fish oil, vitamin C, and sunlight lamps are also good for survival
At no point is there *not* sun during the summer, though
If it's not cloudy, that is
To us, it just feels like how things are supposed to be
If I go further south during the summer, for example, even only as far as Oslo/Bergen, it feels *very* weird when the sun goes down and it's still warm outside
To us, polar night and midnight sun are normal
We've had snow 3-4 times here in Eastern Norway, actually a good amount but every time theres been a warm period after
Like, lots of snow, then warm weather that removes all the snow, repeat
Rn theres no snow at all
Lapland as in the historic Sápmi, or the Swedish/Finnish territories called Lapland

Should have Norway here too
Would be 98% green
i swear the only reason I would want Norway to be a part of the EU and not EØS is to be a part of all these graphs and stats about the EU
I always look for Norway and we're never there :(
Now do one about Norway
Still no Norway :( 100% renewable since always
Wish EEA member would be included here
Norway’s energy production is 98-99% hydro, while the rest are also renewable, like wind and solar panels
Fairly sure Svalbard uses coal, since wind, solar and hydro obviously aren’t viable
And Sweden's neighboor, Norway are at 98% renewable
99% for the mainland
This is because of hydro power, which works very good due to all the mountains and stuff
However, hydro power is a no-no in the ignorant renewable energy debate because solar and wind are the only ones that count
this is in eu countries though
Rather let countries like the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia who couldt give a shit about the globe gain money instead
And as a dane is it not hypocritical to call out Norway on mineral fuel exports, while mineral fuel exports are the fastest growing export in Denmark
Yes, and we are all perfectly aware of that
But it's all supply by demand
We don't need the oil our self but will continue to produce and sell as long as other countries want it
And share our oil money
Pfffft
Haha, no
Seriously, we don't benefit from joining it when we are doing fine on our own
Yeah, I know, but Norway is EU Lite
Yes
And you could build nuclear
Norway is part of Europe continent, Not part of the European union
honestly, if we ever hold another referendum i would probably vote to join the eu
"Mineral fuels including oil was the fastest-growing among the top 10 export categories, up 15
4% in value from 2017 to 2018
And I said mineral fuels, oil alone migh have gone down
We just use our oily greed as a joke to not join the EU
The fact is that Norway wouldn't benefit from most of the trade rules and stuff that the EU enforces
And we have always kept a neutral and free standing position in world politics, just like Switzerland and Iceland
The situation is more or less that we get to choose which of the laws we want to follow, but not get a hand in deciding the laws in the EU parliament
Agriculture in general, because mountainous Norway is not a good place for agriculture, and yet a common policy has been to opt for self-sufficient food production when possible
Also, technically we don't have to follow all the rules (we have an opt-out to any given resolution, IIRC), but Norway has consistently followed a policy of implementing any and all EU resolutions
Norway is interesting
I think we naturally have a healthy diet of vegetables, fish and potatoes, but in the past decades we’ve become super meat and dairy based and definitely eat so much more junk food than we used to
This is based on my impression, not any study

This isn't reported science or anything, but it's my impression that Norwegians might be a little over average addicted to candies and crisps than some other peoples

I’m sure the brits understood what I was trying to say, you need to speak British if you make fun of brits
Yes but what if you go by more important statistics like the number of NFL players per capita, suddenly Sweden doesn't look so great
Kinda confused, compared Norway and US, and the only pros for moving to the US was money spent on health care and electricity
The health care confused me, as we got our cheap health care
Looking at WHO where the stats were taken from, Norway has a total expenditure on health per capita lower than the US
(Stats from 2014 though, ~6400 to ~9400, both in $) The site says it takes both private, employer and public into account, so i'm sure miss a stat somewhere that sets it straight, but nevertheless i wonder if anyone knows why there's such a disparity from the site to the WHO total stats
Edit: Couldn't find much about it, but if employer is included, then i guess it could make more sense
But i still wonder if where the info came from exactly, as it's kinda huge difference compared to what the site states
More money AND slightly less for health care
I'll stay
The 29% more money statistic is misleading
I'm guessing they've already accounted for tax, because the real difference is in the lower single digits
Compare that to the fact that Americans pay for every single thing they do
welp
I would hate to have 12

Well, it's a fun topic
As gruesome as it might sound, i was rooting for Trump once Sanders was out
I felt that he would be more open about his fuck ups, compared to Hillary who'd likely go for a quite death of the country
(Hyperbole) I wasn't expecting to be so right as to have a scandal every other day though
This way, maybe some will learn the hard way
Ok, that was only part of the reason, mostly i wanted to see what things he could fuck up
I was curious, the same curiosity that draws you to click on NSFW /r/wtf links
I think the biggest surprise was that someone how doesn't seem able to speak like a grown up, got to be president
(I must add though, i saw a clip where he did indeed sound very sincere/serious, in a style of someone had died kinda tone
I kinda respected that
Unfortunately, that's not the norm
Trump is kinda like a weekly comic that everyone reads, it gets brought up and everyone knows whats going on in the latest issue
Well, that's my view/experience, i hope i didn't come off too offensively, but it's just how the whole situation feels like
I think America is a great country, know a few nice people, and been there once
But the issues are there, and they seem to be rooted rather deeply
I think black people are more likely to go to prison if they're born into criminal hoods where selling drugs and murder is everyday business, not simply because of their skin color
too close to call
Because Norway is a very expensive country with a small population spread out over a huge geographical area
The country actually covers three time zones but only use one
We don't **spend** more on electricity, we **use** more electricity
*All* our electric power is made by hydro-electric plants, and since it's snowing eight months a year and raining five, there's a lot of water that needs to go through our rivers
Which gives us nearly free electricity, so we waste a lot
It does not say we spend more money on electricety, just that we *use* more
In Norway electricity is cheap due to good acsess to water (98-99% of the electricety production is from water)
Also we have a lot of power demanding industry like aliminium production
From July-Septemper 2015 the prices was 0,04 euro for a kW/h. Suorce:
In Scandinavia it's usually because of the higher wages
In Norway you will earn a base salary of $18/hr as a waiter for example
Food items are usually taxed less
Yes and in particular in the northern rural areas which have led to those working there paying less in taxes and Norwegians may get their student debt paid off by working there for instance
And the lack of nurses all over the country is why I used to speak somewhat understandable Icelandic since I used to date a lot of Icelandic nurses in Oslo
It’s glorious
Sane people (and teachers) of Italy, you have a job to do
This can't be true
What are they teaching about the Holocaust in schools in Italy
Many reasons as listed in comments and i like to add that the news outlets have become less trustworthy as well because of copy paste journalism, clickbait and personal opinions instead of facts, this in turn leads people to be more suspicious of other sources of information as well, but still people don't know how to fact check
This meme is silly, the Finnish practice in Saunas all winter so they probably handle heat better than most Northerners

Plenty of Norwegians have heat pumps for the winter, which also doubles as AC if you want it to
We are used to the average temp being around 5 degerees

Literally a block chain
I think Norway is very much the same with the Nordic countries - especially the Scandinavian ones
But I think we'd trust both Germany and France more than GB and Russia
But that doesn't mean we don't like GB at least
I know a lot of Norwegians and Brits work and reside in each other's countries
They're still part of Europe, so they're relatives, you know
But there's just so much going on there
I feel like the US has lost a lot of trust, though
Most of the people I know had a more positive view on the US during the Obama presidency, but since Trump they're critiziced (often as the butt end of jokes) a lot here
Our politics are worlds apart
Germans got it right
Same in Norwegian: Frankrike
Have you seen thr Trump and his actions
You know who and what Putin is
You know you can expect him to stick to deals he makes

They don't consider Crimea Ukrainian though
Maybe partly because the almost 90% Russian population who also in large part support becoming Russian
Except in Crimea they identify as Russians and were Russian before Ukraine separated
It's all fun and games playing with the americans, but hopefully the EU will eventually learn to stand up to the far worse predators in Russia and China
They don't want to comply with e.g. a common standard for chargers, also they kind of lock you in many ways into their eco-system
It's also really hard to repair without breaching guarantee-rules and so on

My guess is that OP is Swedish
Norway was offended, but it like a queer kinda not understanding offending
More offending would be giving the northern pets to Finland and the south eastern part to Sweden
I don't get it
Some island
Which seems really weird given how original Norway's new name is
My suggestion would be to call it "Norway" or "That country that *willing* worked with the Nazis" and then make Finland "East Russia"
Oh no, Sweden got the worst burn out of anyone on this map
Should’ve given Bohuslen, Jemtland and Herjedalen to Quislingia
That might’ve done the trick
but the one nazi they mentioned wasn't hitler, but a Norwegian
Skåne is already Danish and no Swedes have a clue what they're saying down there anyway
I like you description of Vidkun Quisling as that one Norwegian nazi and not as Norways biggest traitor

Britain has a lot less reason to switch sides than Sweden did, since Britain is on some islands and only has land borders with Ireland, which also drives on the left, and Sweden is mostly mainland, with dozens of land border crossings with two countries that already drove on the right
Not that it wouldn't be funny to watch them try, but

However, it seems like this might have been an isolated incident caused by a failure in Youtube's content ID system, so it seems that Sony doesn't actually claim to own Bach's music
The problem with EU is that people think people like Farage is unique in the EU parliament
He's not
The EU parliament is a not a technocracy of experts, but a collection of mostly ignorant people voted in without any form of vetting process or formal qualifications needed what so ever
Sounds like your local politicians
Indeed it is
Probably much worse, since people just don't care about who they vote in
Voter turnout is abysmal to the point of being undemocratic, with a turnout falling to ~40% and sometimes even in the 30's.
And now they control the faith of the global internet and over 700 million people
Why does this look so photoshopped to me
They do the same in norway, at least up in the parts where i am from
They do this in norway too, ut I think it's to not blind the driver, and to be nice to tired travelers
How are they supposed to get their morning nap with lights on

Oslo has not been a true capital city for more than 115 years or so, though
Oslo got forcibly moved from its original location in 1624 to its current location by danish King Christian IV who renamed the new city “Christiania” after himself
The modern Oslo got developed in two phases, the 1890s and the 1950s and 60s.
You realize that increased average temperatures doesn't actually mean that we'll get the same temperatures, but slightly warmer, right
Cause if it did; we'd all be very, very dead
Climate change causes _average_ temperature to increase, but does so via more extreme temperatures; meaning you get to see more days of extreme cold and more days of extreme heat, with fewer in-between days
The amount this probably created is absolutely negible compared to other major factors climate change i’m sure
Like air travel, the un-renewable energy industry, just private motor vehicle transportation accounts for 12% of global emmisions
While i don’t disagree with you, it’s important to note that this might not be the case everywhere, as regional differences and the fundamental uncertainty of climate change makes it hard to give a single, short and simple answer
For example, where i live the winters are getting warmer, so much so that where i used to see snow every winter as a kid, and our local janitor would pump water over the lake to create smooth ice for skating, and pile all the snow in the school courtyard into one big pile for us to play in, there’s now just sloppy mush a few days of winter and dead grass the rest, and our summers are getting warmer aswell
Overall it’s just getting warmer here
Not any colder
Just more warmth and more rain
Scandinavia in a nutshell
We don't hate Sweden, we just regard them as our somewhat mentally challenged cousin
Denmark cool though
We go on holidays there and visit Legoland and buy cheap booze
Edit: But, yes
Finnish is giberish
Everyone hates Sweden
Norway and Denmark like each other
Finland is a lovable goof
I'm Norwegian, and I love Denmark and I think of Sweden as the big brother I say I hate, but secretly admire and want to emulate
Finland is more like the cousin I never see, but I think is pretty cool and I wish would come visit more often
This is wrong on almost all accounts
Here's the correct version
* Norway: hates Sweden
Loves Denmark and Finland
* Denmark: hates Sweden
Loves Norway and Finland
* Finland: hates Sweden
Loves Denmark and Norway
* Sweden: hates Denmark, Norway and Finland
10 points if you notice a pattern here
Poor Sweden
PS: "hate" here is like a sibling rivalry, not Pakistan/India or USA/Russia kind of hatred
Reading through the comments - I had no idea everybody loves us so much
Heartwarming
Nowegians love Denmark, and they kind of like us
Swedes annoy us
No, Danish and Finnish is gibberish
Danish might be related to Germanic languages but it sounds even worse than Finnish
But I love Sweden and Denmark
Ja minä rakastan Suomi
Can't wait to federate and leave the EU in the dust
We love swedish danseband (vikingarna 4 life), Ullared cinematic universe (En stark resa med Morgan & Ola-Conny academy award when
), cheap snus and alcohol, and going on camping holidays in Sweden
In Denmark, we love even cheaper alcohol and pipe tobacco, Legoland, going on holidays there, and the cruise ships going to Denmark (Danskebåten)
At least in Northern Norway, we love Finland because it's somehow still cheaper than Norway, and of course the holiday opportunities (Norwegian riviera in Oulu), [but they don't seem to like us]
I’m glad that we have something in common
Nobody hates Norway and Sweden, but everyone hates Denmark
Yes
Piirka is that you
I think you’re misinformed buddy, Sweden and Norway love each other we can just be a bit mean at times
What we have in common though, is that we both hate Denmark
This one is correct
> Don't think anybody hates Norway,
Guess where I will spend next summer holiday
They are cool but the Danish spoken language is also slowly degrading into meaningless, guttural noises, as reported in [this] documentary
The Danes aren't correcting each other because they are too nice, the Norwegians mind their own business, no one cares what the swedes think and Finnish is gibberish
Its a very serious concern for the future of Denmark
Yeah, and we just think Sweden is lame, but don't hate them either
Look at us as best friends
We all love each other, but as all best friends do we call each other fucked up things and say we "hate" one another

Hva faen sa du akkurat om meg din lille svenskejævel
Du skal vite at jeg ble uteksaminert som den beste i klassen min i marinen, og har vært involvert i utallige hemmelige raid mot Al-Quaeda, og at jeg har over 300 bekreftede drap
Jeg er en trent i geriljakrig og er den beste snikskytteren i hele det norske militæret
Du er ingenting annet til meg enn enda en skyteskive

Du er faen meg dø, drittunge
Jeg kan være hvor som helst, når som helst, og jeg kan drepe deg på sju hundre ulike måter, og det bare med mine bare hender
Ikke bare er jeg grundig trent i ubevæpnet kamp, men jeg har også tilgang på hele den norske marinens arsenal og jeg vil bruke dens fulle omfang til å tilintetgjøre ditt elendige rasshøl fra kontinentets overflate, din lille dritt
Hvis du bare kunne ha visst hvilken redselsfull hevn din lille "smarte" kommentar var i ferd med å ramme deg, ville du kanskje ha holdt kjeft
Med du klarte det ikke, og du gjorde det ikke, og nå vil du betale prisen, din svenskejævel
Jeg vil drite vrede over hele deg, og du vil drukne i det
Du er faen meg død småen

The one kebab place in my city is unbeatable if you want *really* spicy kebabs (as in Pepper X level and such)
They are also delicious beyond that
That must be one of the most highly contested titles in the world
Every Nordic city has like two kebab joints on every corner
I'm not even kidding when I say the ratio of kebab places to citizens in Scandinavia is higher than anywhere else in the world
You know Sweden is shit when the only good thing about it is fucking kebabs
Gang violence and periodic instability in ghettos, Islamic terror is worth it because there is a now easy to get a kebab
lol Sweden: the world would truly be more boring without you
Sincerely, Norway
We do, unlike you Swedes we don't see ourselves as mere beasts
But hey if you Swedes are happy thinking of yourselves that lowly then fine
They're in Strömstad
Shhh don't ask questions you don't want answer to
So i did my research and i find Norway richer in all the sites i look at
What site did you use
Because it might have been some years ago when that was published or i cannot trust the world bank
Haha, that sounds like you spent a lot of time "rationalizing" why Sweden is better
I wonder why you feel the need to list why your country is the best
>Generally the further north you go the worse it gets
Ain't that the truth

-_-
Some priorities huh
Yeah :D
One of the many Norwegian words for dog is 'Bikje' which obviously is related to 'Bitch and Bicce'. We use it for dogs in general though, 'Tispe' is the female specific name for dog nowadays
To specify a male dog we just say 'Hanhund' which literally translates to 'He-hound'. Simple
I don't really trust wikipedia, but it may be right in 2014, but i think we are richer nowadays, well atleast after what i looked at
Ok, but that does not have anything to do with it if i trust it or not
Also, very judgemental and very Swedish of you :)
I also said it may be right, but it is in 2014
And i did not see it was from the nordic counsil and it may be changed because that is what you can do on wikipedia
Oh ok, thanks for clarifying that
Either way we are all gonna spend it on beer from Denmark
I know
It's in our nature
It implies that the Romanians nicked the Jack
Yeah, independence is not about economics, it’s about nationalism
Which is fine I guess - but it’s intellectually dishonest to claim brexit/Scottish independence would be economically beneficial or neutral
When Norway ditched EU membership in 1972 and Sweden joined, whole factories were packed up and moved from Norway to Sweden to be inside EU
They never came back
And the ruling parties really wanted us in
That is why we had two referendums, and when both failed, we joined the EEA anyway
What
Sweden didn't join the EU in 1972
That is due to govermental control of natural resources and smart investing of the funds from those resources
Main reasons the «no»-vote won (52,2%):
People feared the EU would take away our power and right to rule
This was even more important in 1994 than in 1972, as the EU had become more ambitious and included more countries (and more potential countries)
People had a (false) perception that the EU would harm the welfare state
Rural Norway were very much against the EU, and rallied in greater numbers than the others
They therefore dominated media and won voters
The pro EU side used the wrong arguments
They focused on the fear of being isolated, when we had already gone since 1972 alone without problem and had joined the EEA
It was basically the best thing to do
Some people still complain, but we would not have the same benefits without the EU
They're Danish
No one understands what they say
The UK has about the same amount of oil as us
The real difference lies in who it enriches

You forgot [sugge] galt, etc
haha, yes I guess they do
I guess what my real question is, for how many years have they lived in Finland
Since WW2
Or before that
> Practically all of the Russian speakers have moved here post-USSR
Interesting
Is it relatively easy for a Russian citizen to get living permit in Finland
> And it's a safer country for raising a family and so on
One of the safest in the world I would say
Thanks for explaining the history
Very interesting

The norwegian one translates closer to swat, not slap

My mom works in import, and all I hear her complaining about all day is how much pain in the ass it is getting stuff from the UK to Norway
We have a bilateral treaty with the UK though
You won't have to if the declared value is under a certain threshold
Here in Norway its about $1000
Cars also go under different rules, they're like one of the few things you cant get into countries without paying extra fees
Though the friend could send you a stash of Pokemon cards worth $500k, declare them as $999 and a gift, and you'd pay no VAT, customs fees or anything
Yes, but she imports food items so it has to be cleared
All I know is that their container of caramels has been sitting in some UK harbor for 3 weeks now
That's right, I think he prefers eating people over cats and dogs
Though your extreme example would probably be inspected and fail ;) The customs agents would send you a nice bill and fine :)
Ah, that explains it
Well, as long as it's under the threshold it still counts
You should be able to get a record for that price

Yesterday there were no clouds at all during daytime
At night it was all cloudy, and as live somewhat up in the mountains, I can see the city and the other side of the fjord, and it was all clouds
Then it’s day again and no clouds at all over the city or the horison
Now it’s evening again and now it’s all cloudy

In Norway too, Oslo lost a lot of its gems in the 60s and 70s because things should be modernised and car friendly
A group from the city council went to the US after the war and got ideas
Luckily not all of the motorway projects were put into live, but enough were
They teared down enough old grandiose buildings as well to build the ugliest brutalist buildings around
They even planned on demolish entire boroughs and neighbourhoods to make them more ‘efficient’, Corbusier style
Unfortunately they did some of it, but luckily not all of it
The old has been more appreciated later, the ‘architecture’ from 60s and 70s has not
Well, there MAY have been other considerations other than "jealousy".
How about Køln

Norwegian party leaders having a Christmas debate
Topics include: favorite movies, dinner and silly outfits
It makes me glad i live in europe and not the US
The guy in the 5th picture, Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, is actually bald, he is wearing a wig
I thought that was pretty funny
I think he did it to look like the two female politicians
Trygve Slagsvold Vedum with a wig is the best thing I've ever seen
Why generalise for the entirety of Europe
And why even bring up the US
Debatten "The Debate" is fun and interesting at the same time
And the host "Fredrik Solvang" is like the Jeremy Clarkson of Norway
Mostly reacognized, makes jokes, good program host, and can be serious

Hey thats sounds important too
Not nearly as crazy
There are some really small parties that are, though
Believe it or not, it wasn't meant to be so inflammatory
It is just them showing up on TV for a bit of fun
It was just good fun, 0% serious debate, mostly banter
This was only the leaders of the 4 largest parties, would usually be 8-9 in a proper debate
It also wasn't a full debate, but part of kvelden før kvelden, a show that runs on NRK every year on the 23rd(40+ years)
Edit: Some clips from the debate
Edit2: Also, snap elections/dissolving the parliament isnt a thing in Norway/not possible because of the constitution
there is a debate on tv multiple times per week, but not necessarily with politicians
the only times they mentioned politics in this one was for banter, because it was a Christmas special
> Wikipedia says no election till september 2021
We have a functioning democracy
We don't go like "Shit, only 2 months until election
Need to have those debates NOW
We have debates Thursdays and Tuesdays on current topics
These are not "official debates", but rather the debates scheduled by the national broadcaster
There is a _really high_ bar to decline an invitation
Even the PM can't simply "not show up". If you are relevant to the topic, you go
Every few months, there will be party leader debates
Simply because times changes, and the media will push all the party leaders on what they have done the past few months
Furthermore, the Broadcaster also has a radio show (which is also sent on live TV) every single day, where topics of current events are talked about
Here all the relevant people are also invited, and just like the debates, the bar for not showing, is really really high
Politicians basically can't refuse
The only real way to not show, is if there is pre planned government business that takes priority
But that will only get you of the hook until the next broadcast
TL;DR: We have debates twice a week on current topics
It's political suicide not to show up
Ministers and party leaders are present in almost every broadcast
"Party leader debates" are held at regular intervals
Yep
I think so, but i don't know if it is translated
Im left wing, but calling Fremskrittspartiet far-right is a bit of a stretch
Id call them right-wing, probably  somewhere between democrats and republicans, though its really hard to make a comparison to US politics
I dunno about everyone
I mean iceland yeah, but there are worse places
It was pretty funny
It was absolutely hilarious, I loved every second of it
Common we have Teslas, singlehandedly saving the planet up here
I don't think that's a fair comparison
Norway's money is still fairly new
Oil was found in 1969, took a few years after that before it was in production so a lot of the population was alive at that time
And the boomers are the ones who reaped most of the benefits
What old money is there in Norway
Why
Uhh, no
In Norway 40% eat ribbe on christmas eve, and 39% pinnekjøtt, which is largely an eastern/western divide
So it is actually a pretty big topic

Why do they wash it with chemicals
What are EU's problem with GMO's? Chemically washed chicken meat coming from chickens raised under horrible conditions I can understand
But why GMO's?
How the fuck, can a company demand EU to change its food hygiene standard because of the U.S trade deficit ?
Why the flying fuck cant they just change their products ?
And if the thing the US wants so desperatly to trade overseas with isn't up to the standards of the nation/block they are interesting in trading with
Maybe they need to improve their standards
Ah I didn't know
You got a source for that
Well, that is a very good point
Thanks for the link

In general that is the answer a person without a source would give
Was hoping not having to read through 550 comments
So nice
This is what we need to do in Norway too
This is not classical architecture
It's renaissance, which means it uses plaster to create the illusion of classical features (fake columns, etc) and often with limited understanding of or adherence to classical architecture, which is highly formalized
I can't tell from the image but I'm pretty sure they mix column orders in their pilasters, which is one big no-no
> Have we finally gotten over the drunken stupor that has devoured the entire architecture world after WW2
Modernist architecture was well established before WW2 (and [reviled by the Nazis] as "degenerate art"), and there have been so many distinct movements within the world of architecture _since_ WW2 that it's hard to read this criticism as anything deeper than "I wish buildings were nice and old-timey".
That's fine if you want to live in a museum city but there are very real reasons why architecture has evolved, and if you want nice cities then you need to assess buildings on a deeper qualitative level than "modern sucks, give me stucco".
You could call second-wave postmodernism and brutalism drunken stupors if you want and I'd be inclined to agree, but one thing's for sure; they're not the *same* drunken stupor
The building was remodelled when renaissance was out of fashion
Now those decorative elements are not passé but retro, so it's being put back up
(There is an irony there, considering that those renaissance facades are themselves just chintzy stucco imitations of classical architecture)
It's all about fads and by judging a building solely on how you feel about the general architectural style you're just as much a part of that as the people who tore down the stucco
At least [the Grand Hotel in Oslo] looks good  :)
I think that picture was taken with Kodak JPEG ASA 200
You can't build with copper cladding anymore because we didn't like how it killed the environment
Sort of, but it is not longer symmetrical as the [neighboring building] had the last roof window on the right

For Queen Elizabeth II to match King Louis XIV's reign, she must neither die nor abdicate until May 16th 2024
On that day, she will be 98 years and 26 days old

Why did Haiti change theirs, though
Their white rectangle with an emblem is one of the worst features I've seen on a flag
It was well deserved
He gained the nickname after the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 where he was victorious against the Bulgars
He captured 15000 men, and blinded 99 out of every 100 captives, letting the last man lead the remaining 99 home
The trick is to start your reign as early as possible
Louis started his reign at the age of 4 and a half years
He didn't get older than 76, so Elizabeth has him beat in total longevity

One of them, Vladimir Komarov, was killed at the end of his second mission when the parachutes that should have slowed his capsule down failed to deploy and he slammed into the Earth at an unsurvivable speed
A couple of the others are still alive; the rest died of non-space flight related causes
I know the Lost Cosmonaut stories are popular, but there is simply no evidence that any of them ever happened
The US and the Soviet Union were spying on each other so extensively that it would have been impossible for a disastrous space mission to completely escape notice

wonder who's number one in the world just saying
I don’t get these maps that only include the EU and not Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and the UK for example when the statistics used are from the whole world and would be easy to put there
I would understand if it was from a study done by the EU, or some statistic about the EU, but I literally don’t see the point of making a map of the EU and not just all of Europe
Oooohh, it's the EU of course, wondered why Norway wasn't there

It affects press freedom and the free flow of ideas if certain ideas will lead to harassment, loss off  advertisers and publishers

Note that self-censorship is unenforced sensorship, it can simply 'not happen' but happens nonetheless

This numbers are highly subject to change though, as these are considering the temporary restrictions because of COVID

Yeah, but you underestimate the power of a nordic passport in the nordics
Like, you don't have to apply for immigration
You just move, and in a few years, you claim citizenship
You tell the state and it just happens
It's not necessarily one specific country
&#x200B;
So Finland might (as an example) have access to Pakistan, wheras Germans have access to Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
So here, Finnish people can still go to a country Germans can't. Germans just have the most overall
&#x200B;
I'm a dual citizen for example, and while my Norwegian passport gives me Visa free access to more than 2x as many countries as my South African passport, Norwegians need a visa to visit Russia, whereas South Africans don't. So even though my South African Passport is far worse, I can still get into places that my Norwegian Passport can't.
Why do you hurt us like this Hellas, I thought we were friends
I think theoretically the two most powerful would be a Western / Northern European passport and a passport from the UAE (which gets you visa free access to China, Russia, and most middle Eastern states
I think that gets you up to around 190 countries visa free
Although that combination is technically impossible since the UAE doesn't allow any form of dual citizenship
Im curious as to where that comes from and how is greece called in greek
Yeah, although with a lot of those combinations, you need to check dual nationality
So while that is technically the best combination, the UAE doesn't allow Dual citizenship under any circumstance
So it is impossible to actually have that combination
Oh okay
So we use the correct name
How come english uses greece
Faen
Oh i see
Thank you
Damn I didn't know this
Definitely glad we didnt settle for grekenland
Not as bad but probably just cause im used to it
I think we sometimes tend to forget the achievements of the Soviet army during WW2
They were also the ones to liberate north of Norway
(Thank you
Heihei nordmann
They did help win the war
I'm not defending all the rest they did
Was it to prevent Germany to take all of Poland
Or did the Soviets invade first
Me and my SO was supposed to fly to Dubrovnik today
Safe to say that plan fell out the window
Been there multiple times
Want to live there one day
I'm guessing from your username that the next time I'll visit, I'm gonna hit you up for the drugs then

Free trade without free movement is't going to happen
And no, CETA is not a valid model
It deals with *goods, not services

They just scream a vaguely worded fantasy
UK, don't let the teasing get to you
Merry Christmas from Norway
The ability of some people to view the EU as some kind of benevolent creature never seize to amaze me
No, the EU is not santa claus
The EU's only role is to work for the interests of their member states by creating an inner market and an outer market
At the expense of everyone else
In the words of G.W. Bush, "You are either with us, or against us
Nah, Santa is **not** from Finland, he's a stateless refugee from the North Pole
You're welcome
Always a pleasure
Nah, he's grandfathered in as a Greek :)
Because there's almost nothing Christian about Finland
:) Santa is rooted in ancient European traditions and religious beliefs
There's no historical precedence for Finland
Heck, Turkey and the Netherlands have more claim to him
Greenland and the North Pole are acceptable to me
It's co-opting something that's central to our shared cultures purely for financial motives
It's a bit like making a "Jesus village" in Beijing
He sure didn't come from there and it doesn't fit the narrative
I wonder if there's something to the claim that there was an agreement that no Nordic nation would claim Santa for themselves, but that may be just a legend
It is *protecting Ireland
* There's no "bullying
" The UK is demanding a unicorn deal
Do you have a source for that number
Yes, but that's about as likely as the Kalmar Reunion
Barrels of nuclear waste before they are forever sealed into the vaults of Onkalo, Finland's nuclear waste repository
That the average age is above 30 is rather interesting, but probably says something about unemployment rate and cost of renting/buying a home
Ah, Norway, the non European country in Europe
The Median was about 19 in Norway according to a [2009 SSB article
Doubt the numbers are far off from today, but the article mentioned that the trend is that the median is increasing slightly
As a norwegian i can confirm we never leave our homes
None of these maps over 'Europeans' cover Norway
I'm starting to feel left out :(
I see Norway is missing again
Its reason enough to join the EU just so we would stop being excluded from these maps
Norway's youth moves out at 19
3 years old
Source:
Me, and most of my friends moved out when we were 16 (Started high-school) Didnt know people lived at home for this long
I guess we just moved out very early then
Which language is this
I moved out at around 20 but now when I'm 40 my mom moved in with me due to health troubles
oh how the turntables
I moved out when i was 16, norwegian
And the rich, and the politicians, wants to bring in tons of new people, because Europe "needs labor-force" and "we can afford it
I left home when I was 15 (the year I turn 16) - Anyone living in areas that don't have high schools close enough to home will have their kid leave home at that point
This will drive the average down a lot
I expect the median time is closer to 19 for University
Here changing your address takes two minutes (done online)
What makes the process complicated where you live
And don't you end up paying taxes to the wrong city/town when you haven't changed the address
Europen
Club
I don't understand
No, why should there be a limit
Had to go to high school and the school was 1
5 hours from where i lived
Norway is not in the EU, so no stats for that
- Finland yes
I don't know why it differs
But they differ in a lot of ways
Sweden is almost 1:1 between men and women, but in Finland, men have several years more at home
The source of this is most likely from [here] However, I can't find anything newer than in 2015
And yeah, would like to see Norway vs Sweden, as it should be fairly similar
Denmark is, but a smaller country, so less chance of leaving the house for highschool
Should always make sure to root out corruption, especially when it's high

So Ukraine goes from having a long border with Russia to another place that also have a long border with Russia
As for Norway, being relocated to Croatia now that the oil is gone seems like a win
Montenegro and Kosovo: right, just scoot over
Tfw Moldova, Kosovo, Czechia, Austria, Serbia, Belarus and N. Macedonia still cannot into sea
At least they still don't have to pay for navies
As far as I can tell there's one very long chain that goes through all the countries, with the exception of two three-cycles:
San Marino -> Monaco -> Liechtenstein
Czechia -> Belarus -> Serbia
and of course France, Russia and the Vatican City being stationary
the heat might be alittle much, but i won’t say no to a nice adriatic beach
So we get more sun which would be nice
But I think I prefer space
Norway so small it just disappeared
Nvm it’s now Croatia
What's the area of Norway
Did you count the southern and northern colonies
Literally like any summer before this one by other words
I’m fine with this
My parents will be quite happy, as the yearly trip to Brac in Croatia will be quite a bit easier
As someone who hasn't acclimatized since winter 97 and -40, no
I melt at 20c.
Plane to Split and ferry from there :)
Very well, we can meet Iceland and Lichtenstein somewhere else
KEKW
Nope I disagree
The earth is Norway
Sorry poland
If you are outdone by every nation in the eu (except france, our flag is not white) and you were crushed by russia then you can’t be earth
Damn It
Norway was also conquered by the Finnish, Danish, Swedish, germans and Russians
Well at least we are Vikings
By this standard I imagine the entire US would be red
Edit: I might have misunderstood the map if it stands for GDP per capita
Ah yes, the Guide To Racism
Hahaha suck it Denmark, not even fully blue or grey smh
Are there lots of undercover bicycling policemen in the Netherlands I wonder
I like the touch that the policeman has put sunscreen (or whatever that is) visible in his backpack
(To look like just another tourist
Very cool
And I guess the tip for any larger city is - wear your backpacks and handbags in front, or don't keep any valuables in them
True
So there are lots of undercover cops in Brazil as well
As a side not: some of the nicest people I've ever met are Brazilians
I know several that moved to Norway and South Africa
Really friendly people

I resent you for making us dry and barren, and Sweden lush and green >:(
I think it's time for Germany to invade another country
Let's just wait and see who get's in the finals first
80% of the comments here prove media is far too Americentric
Except this time it's oh yes
"Oh yes" says nothing about if something will be successful
Why do y'all have to fuck up the internet, though
Enjoy article 13
I went there, fully expecting it to not exist
But it does
Gotta show this to my husband
Reminded me of [this one] Lets hope Europe again will be filled with brave men and women willing to fight for their country
Yeah, ill forget that
Some bullshit revisionism by someone that can't understand that 99% of the world don't want their bullshit idelogy that lost the battle of ideas already in the 80s if not earlier

Cheers from Trondheim, we got snow today again so yey "spring
This is exactly how I believe my norther Finnish brethren are
Everything is dark and they hate life until the sun comes out
I love it

Moahaha
As a Norwegian, can confirm
90% of the news here are either about small meaningless inconveniences, or Donald Trump
Fuck Vy
That's the dumbest shit I've seen all year
Does anyone have names for these "layers" in various languages
In norwegian they are called [blåne] and included in the fairy-tale evoking saying "bak den syvende blåne", i.e behind the seventh blue mountain countour (there is said to be something magical, something from a fairy tale, because it's really far away)
Let me introduce you to induction ovens
Far more responsive and accurate than even gas and far safer
And it heats the pan faster than gas
So fast you have to be careful not to set it to max right away to avoid deforming the pans
Pans only deform if you heat them to max to fast
Cast iron is really the best thing to use on induction
The only pans that don't work are old aluminium pans and post with a copper inlay
Bsdicslly really old and really cheap pots
They're far easier to clean than gas at any rate and the same as ceramic
Easier since there's no direct heat
As for wet fingers, that a very low issue
And generally i never ha a problem
There's also non touch controlled tops
That's awesome
Keep the fight going
I saw a interactive map where you could raise or sink the sea level by X meters
Norway was one of the few countries that hardly changed it's sea borders
That is what you get when your shores are steep and the sea is deep outside your coast

I Google Sweden to keep tabs on the situation in my neighbouring country
It's not looking great

Well that too
but I have friends working in health care in Stockholm

Romania banned it couple of years ago
What's this
Russia too
What do u mean never did
they arrest the gays there
its illegal to be gay there
I wouldn't put it past them, it would serve you right ;)
Ach, you beat me to it
She has lead the country for almost 12 years now, but she was also in the government between 1990-1998
That's almost 20 years in total
Technically, it's even longer, because she used to be in government before becoming chancellor
She was first elected to parliament in 1990 and was immediately appointed to the cabinet by her mentor and eventual predecessor
She's served in government since 1990-1998 and then from 2005-2017
That's almost 20 years and counting
She's served 27 years in parliament
Too many hills
Lol Denmark is double uninvited
good

Oh wow, so straight up almost [songkran] only less [participants] [fun] and [accidents]
for the ones who don’t know (me included), what is OMON

I bet my father had loads of fun driving his fully loaded semi truck up and down this road
That thing killed our old Volkswagen
And this is why biking is less popular here than it is in Denmark or the Netherlands
There are both bike races and roller-ski races held there

It annoys me that the old Top Gear gang didn't do a Norway roadtrip
There's a lot of insanely beautiful roads here but then again the bureaucracy to be allowed to film is also insane
Kattegat
The sea between Denmark and Sweden
My great-grandfather (or great-great-grandfather) was from a farm in a fjord where it was even steeper to get up than this
There was only a footpath leading up to it from the fjord below, and they tied ropes around the waists of the children when they went outside to play
I have no clue why they'd ever want to live there
It's filmed in that part of Norway, but the name "Kattegat" is used
In reality Kattegat is not anywhere near
Yes you can, he was driving for a company which was part of a construction project in Lysebotn
He told me it was hell and he even got stuck one time
Sure, it probably had its merits
I reckon living on a farm in the mountainside was better for production, as it had sun for more of the day/year than the ones in the bottom of the valley
The same to you, have a great week
They do This in Norway too
At korketrekkeren
A hill people sled down which is so long people don’t borger walking up it
Meanwhile r/communism lament how Estonia doesn't appreciate what "great things" the USSR did for them, asking "why are the baltics so bigoted towards communism" in their crosspost to here
You can't make this shit up
You're right
Half the comments are collapsed, not because of low ratings, but because right wing Americans who've never visited this sub before are flocking to this thread
The absence of the state doesn't really seem feasible, but rather so ideologically utopian it should be recognized as impossible
That response is so ridiculous it would be hilarious if the sub wasn't so big
It's hardly surprising though, as those people have already conjured fascism in everyone as it is the only way to justify the atrocities of the USSR
Yet Stalin is held in incredibly high regard still, and there is little will to acknowledge any wrongdoing in Eastern Europe
Sure, but these collapsed comments are a new reddit meassure to combat brigading
Lots of collapsed comments = lots of people who've never posted in r/europe before
There will always be hierarchy
How do you maintain that absence of classes
What if I live in a communist state and want more than my neighbor, or want democracy, or want hierarchy
Either you allow it, which will very quickly erode and upturn the ideology and leave you with a non-communist country, or you don't allow it, and you've arrived at totalitarianism
Cooperation between a group of countries is far more realistic than the complete selfless cooperation of almost every individual required for statelessness in my opinion
Also, society cannot work without organization, is this organization really much different than the state
What makes the state evil besides hierarchy which cannot disappear
Is it that horrible that Estonia makes a museum relevant for Estonia
How is a state inherently oppressive and represent class rule
I am of the perspective that a worker or farmer have good opportunities in my country for joining a political party to gain a platform for their views, which if popular will earn them the position of prime minister
I experience the state to be subservient to the people, thus the state is our tool for organization, not an oppressor
Alright, but then calling for the abolishment of hierarchy is not what is being done
There must be organization, and organization inherently requires hierarchy
Yeah, I'm rather arguing against the idea than you
Others are free to join the discussion
How would that form of governance diverge meaningfully from the current Finnish state
Is the power not in the hands of the people through the almost completely uncorrupted democracy
Can't a farmer or worker easily join a party and become prime minister
That seems to be the case here
Local communities have made agreements to form larger communities which is organized together as a state
If the only difference is more local autonomy then that is already advocated by parties within the parliamentary system
Edit: I don't find it too surprising that anarchism or communism is attractive in e.g. the US or Russia, but in countries like Finland where the state is largely subservient to the people, as it should be, I find it particularly strange to advocate for radical measures
The whole motivation for dismantling the state is that no individual should be required to follow any rule not agreed upon by themself
How does that view not come with the expectation of near fanatic altruism as you mentioned described by Marx
I do not agree theft should be illegal thus I may steal your pet if I am the stronger party
I did not intend to imply that Marx argued for it, merely that it was that sort of altruism he described, seemed like a requirement for communism to even remotely work without the totalitarian approach of past regimes
If self defence is the only thing stopping acts of aggression then the strong will form a new hierarchy praying on the weak
Complete individual freedom must be restrained somehow to avoid such aggression, whether by a state or by expectation of self defence, the latter being unavailable to many
If groups affiliate to serve as defence for those unable to defend themself, conflict arise between groups and the stronger establish hierarchy
Complete, unrestrained individual freedom *is* the dismantling of society
As long as the state remains subservient to the electorate you will have the same result, only that it is the majority rather than the strong who impose rules, which is most favourable to the most people, being the majority
Reminds me of a Polish hospital room I saw in 1994 (where my Norwegian friend had to spend 4 hours with a dead guy (one of his 2 rooms mates died, but was left there for a few hours before picking up the body)
But I believe hospitals have improved in Poland since then
And I hope the care in Romania is better than the room
Wow
The fact that shit is still this bad in parts of Europe is kinda depressing
It's like we live in two completely different worlds
Kids this is why being near the USSR was the best
Good to hear that they have renovated some of it
Things will improve once all of it is done
Your environment does affect you (as a photo of a Norwegian prison somewhere in this thread might be evidence of)
Well at least they put a bed sheet over him
hahaha
You got to love Finish humor
It has to be said that despite Finland being called the land of a thousand lakes, Norway still had more lakes than Finland =P
> Exists
Ha, nice try Japan
Edit: fuck, am I that unoriginal
[No Elks in Europe] but we call Moose; Elg/Älg/Hirvi(???) which is confusing
Pretty sure there are way more moose in Europe than in North America
Never admit that we find ourselves confusing to the Americans
You make a valid point =P
So what
Yes
you are unique
My man
No, we blame the americans with their silly moose naming
Yeah, the reindeer are drawn to roads because there is often a draft there that keeps insects away, and there are a lot of insects in Lapland in the summer
Carry on then
Aaaaw
You came back to admit it when you found out
So nice of you =D
Just in case there's ambiguity in my message, it is NOT sarcasm
I actually thought it was nice =D
Did I say that
Although, after discussions following my comment, it seems that Norway may only have more lakes because of a more lenient definition
Repost from r/brasil
What the fuck are Communist memes doing in this sub
Especially when this shit doesn't apply to us(paying outrages sums for tests)
Does it even apply to Americans
What a fucking shitshow this sub and its redditors have become
What are the fucking mods doing
This has no relevance to Europe
Its 90% propaganda lately
Edit: Also, you are preaching to the wrong crowd here commies, unlike Americans plenty of (Eastern)Europeans have experience with Communism and do not see it in the same kind light as you do
Imagine being Western European, never having suffered through Communism like Poland and Lithuania, then not listening as these people are telling you socialism is a bad idea
Its not like they would know with their literal experience lol right
Is iodine deficiency a big problem in South Holland
I trust a Pole and Lithuanian with their experiences over a fucking Dutchie any fucking day
Stick to ice-skating and tulips
if that’s what they want, then surely they wouldn’t be doing their job
Can someone name the 11 Norwegian pornstars
Wow, Norway surprises me
> You know it's funny, because from my experience Icelanders are way more promiscuous than Czechs
It helps when you are outside their gene pool
latinos are america specific, romanesque is probably a better term
not [really]
if you could provide a source because i can’t find any who calls anyone not from america latino
in their own language is a different case, but you reffered to them as latinos in english
it’s not a race or culture, correct, but it’s a term in english that refers to people form the latin speaking parts of america, usually south and central america
personally, i wouldn’t call anyone not from latin america a latino
anyone from france, italy or spain are french, italians or spanish
if i had to use a umbrella term i would use southern european
the ony exception would be if a french person was from french guiana, but again i would probably just call the french still
well my personal defenition is based on what i could find on the internet, what is more prominent in english and such
i based my "personal" on what the most prominent definition of latino was on the internet
The scene from "the Pianist" where he emerges from hiding and sees the city reduced to rubble, in complete and utter ruin, is a scene that will stick with me for a long, long time

Out of all the languages in this thread Polish never fails to blow my mind
No worries, Norway as the superior Scandinavian country is represented
I hate this time of year
Cold in the morning so I wear warm clothes and it rises to god damn 15 degrees during the day
I'm melting
On the other hand, it's funny to see the guys who don't give a shit and wear t-shirts and shorts during the 5 degrees period in the morning
On Saturday it even reached 16 degrees
Yeah we had like 18°C here I live in Norway yesterday
Infuckingsane
9 degrees in Oslo
It is like hell here
Please help
I saw 18 degrees C on snapchat today, it was insane
Sudden spring, on friday, all the roads were covered in snow or slush, now they're all bare and the snow levels have noticeably gone down after a weekend of +5C and sun
Got to drive up beer and canned food to the cabin for the summer now before the snow is gone, usually you can still drive snowmobiles above the tree line in mid-may, but now I'm not so sure
That was two weeks ago
It doesn't smell like Shit anymore here
Yaaay
I'd rather be a bit cold in the morning than dying of heat stroke the rest of the day
Literally sitting at a train station outside in shorts and a t-shirt reading this
You dont laught at my zip-off pants now
Actually why we're surviving economically
We have less than half a year to spend money living, the rest of the year we hibernate
[And it's soon time to start cooking outdoors again
It comes in pints
I'm getting one[!]
Wait, you ordered alcohol
The thing with Melbourne is that all the houses are built as if there is no winter
10C in April feels like a heat wave
10C in july I'm freezing my ass off
All about expectations
No, you still can't into Nordic
Stop asking, we've gone over this before
Jeg mener jeg leste på yr at Sørlandet kom til å flomme over om vi fikk tidlig sommer i år.
It’s 50°F.
0°C is when water freezes
Well it does now, frost is out of the ground and farmers are spraying shit all over the fields
Ahh, the smell of spring
Can't drink on the street anywhere in ~~Scandinavia~~ the Nordic countries, it's just that they don't enforce it in certain areas since the law was meant for public nuisance and not chilling in the ~~purk~~ park
Edit: it was early, no coffee
I started the magical "smoke-out-the-neighbours"-season on saturday by burning the grill clean and making some skewers
During the snowstorms you sit on the porch with an ice cream cone and wait for it to refill
Because we like to joke around
People here love warm weather and everyone is outside when it's nice and warm outside
Also after spending a week or so in a hotter climate you get used to it
Er ikke det hvert år da
I hear the voctorians are building a new tunnel from london, the Emu express they call it
The sleeper cab is probably worth it
I would make a case for 18C being ideal night temperature
And since bedroom temperature cannot be lower than outdoor temperature, 18C is where I draw the line
Unfortunately I'm so picky about it anything below is too cold and anything above is too hot
What do you think i'm wearing
Ah but you see, -10C to +10C is the worst temperature area
Well that and -30C and lower, as well as +30C and higher
Well we sometimes use an oven mitten, but that's to protect from the heat
Barbecues get pretty hot you know
Main issue is that it need to be warm enough to comfortably sit down and eat outside without bulky clothes
Also the food tend to get cold pretty quick after serving so best to stick with quick "finger food" or stuff that is just as good when served cold
Mittens
Well
in 10°C I'd still use that to prevent my hand from getting fried by the barbeque, not to keep it warm from the really nice weather
Now if you'd ask what I/we do when it's -10°C (yes I have fired up the barbeque in -10 - it's great, if a bit slow to get going), then we might be on to something here
I barbecued on saturday in 12C, AMA
I was going to, but there was still half a meter of snow where the barbecue usually stays
Maybe next weekend
Nonono, don't give me that bullshit, *where can you order alcohol
No it’s ok
It’s not your fault your country keeps using backwards measuring systems (:
Did you actually barbecue or just burn a pack of sausages then drench them in ketchup to hide the taste of ash
Fun fact: only one country separates Norway and North Korea
Think about that
Shit
True, but that feels like a waste
Barbecue and outdoors eating are just linked in my mind
My parents had a big concrete fireplace/barbecue area in the garden with a seating area that's half walled in, so we'd be out there even if the weather was not super nice
Theres a difference
Seriously though I made some japanese style chicken skewers that were perfectly seasoned by the burnt remains of of last years food
Never thought about that
It's not that far away though
By area, France is the third largest in Europe with ~550,000 sqkm, and Sweden is 5th with ~450,000 sqkm
In the case of Sweden, forest

It seems the ECDC does collect data for EU/EEA:
>  but deaths are thankfully going down with each day
That site does not say that
In fact, it's saying that deaths are probably heading up slightly once you adjust for deaths that have happened but haven't been reported yet (the pale grey bars in the top chart)
That may well be
All I take issue with is using a site that shows the opposite of what the person I responded to claimed
The site might be *wrong* about that, but it's like using a link showing that # of known cases is going up as proof infection is going down
Well HAPPY NEW YEAR from Croatia

You guys created a great commercial venture, but Finland has nothing to do with Christmas in my eyes

You said WHAT about blue, red and white flags
Nothing wrong with being red, white and blue
Russia has 110
Not my experience from their dash cams but
I want my Norwegian highway to have 135 on a single highway just to be better than Sweden
Yeah it's not much
But no child died in traffic here in 2019
So there is that
Norway only has about 500 meters of road that you can safely do 110 on
Most places you'll be doing 50-80
If you notice the vodka is wearing off you're allowed to drive faster in order to do a refill
Nice
Can you make a map of the *actual* speed people drive
No, that's just the general speed limit outside of built-up areas, we have highways with higher standards that also has a higher speedlimit
As the title of thread says "maximum speed limit".
That's just the standard speedlimit for highways I think, there is some roads with 120

I wonder how that is pronounced
"Pils" is also common

*adjusts glasses* when did yugoslavia return
Fun fact, it's only in the Scandinavian countries we talk about "bayer" as a beer type
People from Bayern/Bavaria haven't heard of it, like /u/zamazigh points out
They might know the style under the name of a Münchner Dunkel
Norwegian: Øl, olje
Which is extremely funny for Norwegians
In Norwegian, the similarly sounding word “bæsj” means poop
It's short for pilsner, a type of beer that was invented in Pilsen in the chech republic
Yes
We use y or i as vocals, j is rarely used in the middle of words unless in "tj", "kj", "sj" or "skj". We say "høy/høyere", "bøye", "fornøyelsespark", etc

I am confident that our Nordic black sheep will return to us again at some point
But we have to be patient and let them make their own mistakes
That's how they can grow
Between the Nordic countries the Nordic Passport Union has granted free movement since 1954
Because of the Schengen Treaty, this distinction is not readily apparent, but it is still there

I think the only big mistake made was not preventing the public visiting old age homes at the same time Denmark and Norway did so
But there were so many unknowns back then
Norway's prime minister has admitted that maybe it was not necessary to close all schools
I feel kind of sorry for all politicians through this
It's not easy to be on top and having to make really difficult decisions
Hopefully things have normalised all over Europe by the summer of 2021
(Edit: spelling)
Well
even tho we appreciate togetherness, being assfucked is another matter
It's not our fault that the Danish people was too lazy to bother keeping it's empire together
*"Denmark, mom says its our turn to rule the union
No, I thought those big lights needed more power
I think closing the schools did not affect the spread of the disease *directly*. But it sure made a lot of people realize that yes, this is serious
It's not the only mistake, there are more people dead outside institutions in Sweden than the rest of the Nordics combined
Schools might have opened a little earlier, but better safe than Sweden
Suppose that Iceland and Norway were opposed to open borders to the EU/Schengen area
Then the other Nordic countries would have to choose
Ireland chose to keep the open borders with the UK
The Faroe Islands has open borders with the other Nordic countries, but they are not in the Schengen Area
When I left the Faroe Islands as a Nordic citizen to go to Copenhagen, there was touch screen on the boarding pass turnstile before the security check asking for citizenship
Those who chose something non-Nordic were pulled aside and had their passports checked
Going from Copenhagen to the Faroe Islands on the other hand, required no checks at all
It might be different if you travel from a non-Nordic country to the Faroe Islands, though
I think you are right
That is in fact the point when people really started taking everything seriously
Maybe not, but there is a medical precident for it
Sometimes kids can carry/be unnafected by a disease but still spread it
And we really knew very little about the virus in the begining

No sign of spring in Northern Norway
On this day there are several snow records broken
This is from E69 to North Cape
Yeah, it's been like that here, too (close to Trondheim) Nice weather, finally spring, boom, snow for like 2 days straight, repeat
Thank goodness I live on the southern coast
Wait, we have a E69 in Norway
Nice
I don’t want to know what the summer will be like
Might as well fix the basement and move down there before it’s too late
and if you come to my city in Norway
the whole place is cold and rainy
just the average Norwegian summer nothing unusual
No sign of spring
It was literally 18 degrees yesterday and I haven't closed my windows since
Yes, what are you going to do about it
They also have far to large herds of reindeers
A lot of them have gotten orders to slaughter large parts of their herds because they are far above the quotas set
Compounded by the overproduction of reindeer meat that they can’t sell
There was actually a reportage about this on the news a couple of days ago
They're basically flying 250 tons of food out into the wilderness with helicopters
Source: [NRK]
It's extremely hot there too
It's just not hot enough to melt the snow enough before the next snowfall
I live in this area, and it's like 10 degrees outside
17C in Oslo
Norway is looong
It's all fun and games until you have to remove all of it from your driveway
They are, but this is an abnormal amount of snow
Barely
Same in Oslo
Norway is looong
I think some Norwegians up north would happily pay you too take some of the snowfall if that was possible
Saw a guy on the news yesterday, and he was so sick and tired haha
"Spring"
We only have summer and winter
Always two there are
Maybe not
The reindeer don’t graze in places like these
They graze on the wind swept plains
I haven’t heard anything about reindeer starvation this year, and trust me
We hear about it when reindeer starve
Its 6 degrees and sunny here and people are waking around in t-shirts
After winter, everything feels hot
I'm North of Alaska
And we are also thought climate science in school here
We know
Also, it's not a lot of snow in Norway
Only in Northern Norway
That’s their claim every year
When it’s really bad mattilsynet are the ones who makes the news about the bad conditions
They do that every year
Primarily from them having much to large herds and not keeping them in the right areas
I’ll consider it an actual emergency when mattilsynet says it is
They’re the ones who monitors that
Mattilsynet is the one that decides
And they provide this “emergency” help every year
And are now forcing several reindeer owners to slaughter hundreds of reindeer to prevent these emergencies every year and come down to their allowed quotas
Look at news for every year back in time, make sure to cover local news for everywhere there’s a reinbeitedistrikt
Seeing as you’re in Germany i doubt you have ever lived in a place with a reinbetedistrikt, I have lived in several of them
Them getting emergency help is as sure every year as sheep farmers claiming hundreds of their “best” sheep were taken by wolfs every year
Either way, only one agency decides if there’s a emergency and covers help for them and that is mattilsynet
They are the official agency for this, not the owners
Reinbetedistrikt aren’t just in the north
Ask mattilsynet if you don’t believe yearly news reports
I don’t think mattilsynet really releases those numbers specifically though
If they actually operated according to traditional methods and here sizes they would herd the flicks to places with easier to get food like in the past
These big herds eat to much though for traditional methods and strip the easy to access areas and in winters like these they are then facing disaster because they can’t get to food in the snow rich areas
It all comes back to modern industrialized production and over sized herds
Yet another anecdote
A single starving moose
because that doesn’t happen every winter or anything
All I’m saying is that if you haven’t seen news about starving reindeer and their owners asking for help in local and sometimes national news every year the last 10-20 years you haven’t been paying attention or you’re actively ignoring it
Yeah sure it’s bad this year
But at some point yelling wolf will bite them back , especially when they willfully break the laws by having twice as many animals as they’re allowed
And you can claim this isn’t what causing this years issue
But having twice as many animals eating is going to cause issues twice as fast especially when they have to move in from the areas with easily accessible food because the herd that’s to big ate it all
You’re ignoring all these arguments to focus on straw men you build so you don’t need to defend why they keep breaking these laws and why big herds is an issue that also aggravates food issues cause by environmental issues
We tried outlawing it here in Norway, but disturbingly most politicians were in favor of mgm
Lol this made me remember when i was in Barcelona with class and we were tasked with finding out to what degree Catalonia was independent/ self governing
So I asked a security guard outside a museum or something and he proceeded to rant about how Spaniards are lazy and that Madrid takes money out of Catalonia
He was a really fun and nice guy too
Were the young turks really any better

Isn't it boring to live without a garden, garage, fireplace and so on
It’s called the Aral sea
Russia moved it westward, didn’t you hear
The bigger problem is that people use the property market as an investment
I guess some people rather want to live like ants in a hamster wheel than being free
In my country, Norway, freedom and independence is a very important value, according to the European Social Survey
So I guess this has a lot to do with culture, values and so on
Even in the cities here most people live in houses
If people live in apartments, it's often because of necessity (in the cities they are cheaper to buy than houses), but when they get kids most of them move into suburban areas
And who decides the laws
The population (through democracy)

I'm from way up north, and I don't know this situation good enough to really take a stand
But I feel like they (Spanish and Catalan gov) kinda play the game of one-up each other here, I'm not sure if that's the best approach, especially if you want to keep it at least kinda peacefully
Another thing, isn't Catalonia kinda split in the middle when it comes to independence
I think that number should be way higher before you do something like this (maybe 75-80% at least)
You don't want your new claimed state to rip it self apart as well as a the fight with the old country, right
As I said, I don't know shit, so this is more like questions, not a comment
I wish all the best for the Catalan people
Their right to decide their own future is what democracy is
I hope this is the right decision in the long run
Let's hope spain doesn't handle this like they handled the referendum
Some representatives left the building in protest

That is a very interesting spelling of alphabet

Nah, tuborg is actually good in Denmark since they use better water there
Better water in denmark
Wut
Yeah definitely boring, it's practically a standard unit
It's common for beer brands to use tap water in their original city, but distilled water at other breweries
This is because the minerals in the water affect the taste
So Tuborg is better in Denmark because they use undistilled water
Yeah, but they rarely manage to get it the same as the original

Absolutely horrendous
Two students from my school fell victim there
"When one man can show so much hate, imagine how much love we all can show together" -Helle Gannestad, a member of the youth organization which was attacked on 22
Of July
I live in the place where Utøya is, and I even visited it two years ago due to school
It was very eerie and difficult to go there
It was so quiet, and no one seemed to be able to talk to each other
On the island, we visited a cafe building where people had been shot and killed
You could see the many bullet holes, and it’s one of the things I can never forget
Especially the pictures of the victims that had been killed there
Our guide told us how some families have “spots” on the island where their beloved one was killed
It’s where the families go to grieve
We also went to a museum-like place where you could read the text messages between the victims and families
It was so heartbreaking reading the last texts between a parent and their child
I can say that I did not come out of that memorial with dry eyes
Another thing that also struck me hard, was that a girl who had been on the island when it happened (she was 11 years old), and unfortunately lost her mother, worked in a cafe on Utøya
We went to the same school and she used to be my classmate
She’s such a sweet and lovely girl, and my heart bleeds for her when I think about what her family must’ve been through
To this day, 22
July is still a very sore subject to talk about
At least for us locals who live near Utøya
I had a cousin who was on Utøya
I remember sitting there watching the NEWS in complete silence with my family not knowing whether he was alive or not, my aunt and uncle started driving down to Oslo and gave us updates underways
We didn't know if he was still alive until after the police had made it to the island
We went to my grandparents to help calm them down
Not until around 19:00 did we get the message that he was alive
Words cannot describe the absolute terror we felt
The sorrows we as a nation felt
But also the love and community felt afterwards
This pisses me the fuck off
77 people were *murdered* in cold blood by an absolute fucktard of a human being
It took less than 10 years for Netflix to make a documentary about it
I know this is an European sub, but if someone did that with 9/11 there'd be protests and a bunch of bullshit, meanwhile this *terrorist* attack is not even being shown as what it actually is, a little bitch of a shitstain that murdered 77 people, and would have murdered an entire political party "camp" targeted at *youth*.
That day was so surreal
First a massive explosion down town
The main building at the governmental quarter was the target
Killing eight people instantaneously and making the whole country direct our focus, and more importantly, our police and medical resources to what seemed like 9/11 terror attack
At this point the country knew little to nothing about the situation
Even NRK (The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) published articles speculating that this was the work of terror organization "Al Qaida" (ref:
It wasn't until approximately an hour later that it was declared that this was but a distraction
I remember that 7 year old me was at a circus having fun while it happened
It feels surreal to associate such a happy memory with such an awful incident
I was only 10 years old when it happened and I remember it clearly
I’ll never forget that day
We were not in the country when it happened, so seeing my own country being attacked like that and watching the TV the whole day and not knowing what was gonna happen next was horrible
It was weird to come home again
I also made a Facebook group after it happened about hating on Breivik
Not sure what happened to it
Now that I think of it, my grammar wasn’t very good back then
I remember waking up that Saturday morning - having already struggled to fall asleep - turning on my phone and seeing "92 people killed\*" blaring at me
It was so bizzare and unreal I think my brain struggled to comprehend it
I hugged my two kids extra that day
&#x200B;
(\*the initial reports during the night was 85 killed at Utøya and 7 in Oslo
This was later revised downwards to the 69+8 number)
21 years is the maximum penalty given here in Norway
But this is a very special case
So the thing is that he's jailed for 21 years, but he's under surveillance 24/7, and even tho he's jailed for 21 years, he will most likely never make it out to society
Doctors/psychiatrist has to make that decision
If they cannot "rehabilitate" him, he will most likely stay jailed for the rest of his life
He got what we called 21 years forvaring (preventive detention)
From [Wikipedia]
>The indeterminate penalty (civilian penal code), called "preventive detention" (Norwegian: forvaring), is set at up to 21 years' imprisonment, with no eligibility for parole for a time period not exceeding 10 years
If the prisoner is still considered dangerous after serving the original sentence, the detention can be extended by five years at a time
Renewal of the detention every five years can in theory result in actual life imprisonment
Preventive detention is used when the prisoner is deemed a danger to society and there is a great chance of them committing violent crimes in the future
[2] However, after the minimum time period has elapsed, the offender can petition for parole once every year, and this may be granted if it is determined that they are no longer a danger to society
TL,DR: He'll never be released
Breivik is not likely to be let out at 53, as he was sentenced to 21 years with what I think is called Special Detention in English
In practice, that means that he will remain in prison as long as they still deem him a danger to society
As for his cell, Norwegian prisons generally focus on rehabilitation over punishment
which applies to all prisoners, including the ones we like the least
That's the way it should be everywhere, as far as I'm concerned
Now you're just spreading misinformation
He's not free to leave after his sentence of 21 years
He will potentially be in prison for the rest of his life
The sentence can and most likely will be extended every five years until he's dead
Treating criminals like animals and torturing them has not served anyone well
It's not even good for the people working in the prisons
I won't go into detail
Prison is not about cruel punishment, it's loss of freedom only
Our laws prevent cruel and unusual punishment, as we've done that in the past
It does not lead anywhere good
The law is absolutely **not** on the side of anyone that chooses to kill Breivik after he is "released" (unlikely)
You are clearly not well informed
He got Forvaring, which means after his sentence is over there will be a panel every five years
The panel will then decide whether or not he is still a threat to society
Which they probably will decide until Fjotten is dead
Same here
I was 10 when it happened, and I remember watching it live and seeing my family staring watching the news as Oslo and Utøya happened live, but I never really understood what was happening
My young mind thought it was war in Norway, but I didn't really understand until later what the attacks was about
Yes, but the system really isn't designed with people like him in mind
Even so he technically can get released
His base sentence run out after 21 years
After that there will be a review every 5 years
If at some point after that the review find that he is rehabilitated and no longer pose a threat to anyone he would get released
Seem like a very unlikely scenario at the moment considering his total lack of remorse, but who knows what happens 30+ years down the line
It really isn't about rehabilitation in this case
It's about preserving our own justice system and sense of self
We didn't change our society or justice system
We had our laws in place, and we respected the victims, by treating the offender like the criminal he is
He is nothing special and justice was served
Not everyone understands or likes it, but everyone can agree that the law was followed
>The panel will then decide whether or not he is still a threat to society
What I find challenging: what if he is no longer deemed a threat to society
What if he does a heel-turn in prison and starts rejecting his previously held beliefs and ideas and instead deeply regrets what he did
"Dom på forlengelse innebærer at det fortsatt vurderes å være fare for gjentakelse av alvorlige straffbare handlinger
" ([
I remember vividly the talks during the trial and how it was concluded "he will never get out", but .. to my knowledge we cannot keep him imprisoned based on the severity of the crime alone
Some of his victims, who lived, will only be in their 30's and 40's when his sentence is up
Purpose
He is a living embodiment of our respect for human rights, justice, rule of law and due process
Do you see how that doesn't mean he's the one benefiting
It's our society we're respecting and protecting
We didn't change our way of life due to that attack on it
Hypocritical
No, the justice system is there for everyone, regardless of his crimes
His lack of respect for human rights doesn't mean we should do the same(!) We honor his victims by respecting the very system they wanted to preserve and improve
He may have legitimate claims of mistreatment, it's *not* unlikely due to his crimes, so he should absolutely have the right to make his case and be heard
That doesn't mean he should win his cases, that is a completely different matter
You are completely wrong in assuming they're "dangerous animals". They're humans and you could end up in prison yourself by accident
Many of them are simply damaged (abuse) or mentally ill, or even retarded
Socio-economic conditions often leads to crimes (poverty)
Those who kill are often related to their victims (family)
People make huge mistakes as well (robberies gone bad, drunken crimes, etc)
Treat humans as animals and you get the same in response
American jails prove the point, they're training camps for violent offenders
Not everyone can be saved or is safe to release, but you should at least try to preserve your own dignity by not abusing weak and damaged humans
Keep the dangerous criminals in detention, but don't abuse them
&#x200B;
>I don't see his sentence as something that punishes him
Yes, he's not supposed to be punished, the lack of freedom is the punishment
It's quite sufficient
We've long since moved away from retribution, cruel and unusual punishments or torture \[in Europe\]
However, many people have the view that criminals deserve to be hurt badly to "pay" for their crimes; a simple human response to a complicated problem
It doesn't give the victims satisfaction or justice, it doesn't prevent crimes from happening (see passion, economics, for example)
IIRC even the people who drove him on the ferry to the island where weirded out by him
Don't think Norwegians now see him as this suave sociopath who can trick mental health officials
We all know what he really is
No, that's only if all else fails
Paradoxically, letting violent criminals back into society and giving them trust gives the lowest recidivism, and thus less crime
If we fall down to his level, we are no better than he is
We have to be the bigger person

Czechia is a grey zone, but if you asked random people in the streets, would young people probably say west, and old say east (cuz cold war history)
Austria west
Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia east
Spain, Portugal, southern france, Italy south of *arbitrary point*, and Greece would be southern Europe (syden)
Can someone explain the 3 cultures of France
And what makes Estonia more central than northern
Your new empire
> Not sure what this means, but Estonia shares social values with Scandinavia
I agree
I lived in Estonia for 12 months once and visited several times after that, and felt very much at home
The exception was the Estonian Russians - who I found to be very different - although not necessarily in the bad way
They were just a lot more
loud
Native Estonians however I see as very Scandinavian in personality and culture
i think he means geogrsphically they’re not northern europe because they’re not part of the fennoscandinavian peninsula, which all the nordic nations with the exception of iceland and denmark are
and denmark and iceland are still fairly connected the rest
denmark is only seperated by a tiny strait, and has a seriously short border with the rest of the continent
personally i think the baltic states should be their own region, they certainly don’t fit as "central european" when that denomination includes switzerland, poland and **croatia**. either that, or they should be incorporated into eastern europe
i think the baltics have a closer cultural and historical tie to the east than the north
but as i said, i think they should be their own thing
> Germans are weird
In what way
I ask because I'm curious how people in another country view someone in yet another country
>They were just a lot more
loud
So they are like people from Bergen
Yeah but that includes the baltics and parts of Russia too
Looking at this this seems to be more based on culture, language, history and values as all these northern European countries are a part of the Nordic Co-operation
> I suspect your bar for "loud" is set very low:)
Yes you are correct
Unless we are drunk
> Although in my experience yours seems to be much higher that that of the Finns
Correct again
Unless they are drunk
Yes, but we tease them and claim that they say: "I am not from Norway, I'm from Bergen
" I guess it's the way we try to explain that they are a bit different from the rest of us

But I had to google it
I only learned enough Estonian to understand numbers and some common phrases, - so I knew how much to pay in a shop and so one

> Germans dilute apple juice or orange juice with sparkling water
That's heresy
Yummy
> Germans often tend to eat bread for dinner and a warm meal for lunch, whereas we do the other way round
Huh
They never cook dinner at home
> Germans wear bicycle helmets
Does this mean you don't get a fine in Netherlands for not wearing a helmet
> If a sign says you are only allowed to dispose glass on working days between 8:00 - 18:00, you'll be literally frowned upon if you dispose glass outside these hours
so the Dutch don't like following rules very much
Norwegians are kinda unique in the sense that we very rarely eat at restaurants compared to most other European countries
Also, you dilute your apple or orange juice with water
Ugh, det høres ikke godt ut i det hele tatt
Isn't the Estonian õ close to the Scandinavian ø?
> Norwegians are kinda unique in the sense that we very rarely eat at restaurants compared to most other European countries
[72% of Germans eat out less than once a week] so that cant be the answer to eating bread for dinner
:) If that is true

I knew we could count on you, Denmark
Aw, you're adorbz
At least you have Håkan ️
Håkan 4 president
Did he stop for one second and think that perhaps his "shared dreams" are not everyones shared dreams, and that the constant EU drive towards abolishment of state borders and some form of federation lead from continental Europe is what ultimately caused Brexit
Instead of flaming Brits for being "selfish" for not wanting to hang at your house anymore, perhaps try have the introspection to see why
So this guy actually think it is Iceland and Norway (the places that are located north of EU) that have issues with populism on this continent, not his own union
WTF
I think he means that what they're doing is selfish and undermines the efforts of Churchill and all those english men
Effectively he is arguing that it's abandoning the idea of peace and prosperity in Europe for their own selfish gains
[Clear case of penis envy
I just sent a snapchat of the sunny 0C weather here to my colleague who is currently on holiday in Italy
-15 here
And then you have Iceland
Everyone is always claiming Norway is so cold, but just look at the coast
Pretty much a mediterranean climate I tell you
From my experience in the northern part of Norway where it's very cold every year is that the mosquitos grow large as sparrows
Still remember my visit to London some years ago on the 14th of February and lots of spring flowers where blooming
Shocking to be honest
Depends on the humidity
-1 on the coast can feel a lot colder than -5 in the mountains
Luckily it's rarely humid and cold at the same time
Try inhaling through your nose and you'll feel the difference
Your nose hairs don't generally freeze at -5, but at -15 you'll definitely feel it
fuck everything about that
Thank you for posting this, now it feels slightly better that summer is still 3 months away
Tell me about it
I am literally sitting here right now aching all over because of borrelia caused by ticks
I went for a long ski trip with my kids today in -15
They are jumping around, red-cheeked, happier than ever, while I am completely destroyed
Fuck that

Was there a few years ago during a heatwave (38 C), not sure if that was much better

True
You haven't heard of this happening in Finnmark
I'm in the purple area on the map
Summer is still five months away
Nippy
Yeah, I've lived there
Lovely combo of cold, windy and humid
Not that my current location is much better, but Copenhagen is surprisingly cold if you're just looking at the temperature on the thermometer
Sure, but fuck everything about that too
I grew up right next to the ocean where there are almost no mosquitos
You'd like western Norway, where it can be 10 degrees on any day of the year (and raining)

Princess Victoria looks like that princess from Shrek 2
You know which one I'm talking about
Shouldn’t they all be crown princes or crown princess’? Or is that just a Norwegian thing
The 1814 Constitution requires that the Norwegian monarch ask permission from the Storting before accepting the throne of a foreign nation
Given Norway’s history of being ruled from abroad, the people (and thus the Storting) would never approve of it
“Svensketida” (“The Swedish period”) is not thought fondly of among Norwegians
The legalities aside
who would be the true head of state
Queen Victoria of Sweden, Prince Haakon of Sweden, Queen Victoria of Norway and King Haakon of Norway
Hah
They’re mostly all from the same gene pool, aren’t they
King George II back in the 1700 I believe
The current Queen Elizabeth II is actually the 3rd Queen Elizabeth II
They have backup clones that take her place when the old one dies
They're born into power they don't/can't use, most don't have as much wealth as you think, and there's not a lot of them
Yes, hereditary positions is a remnant of the past, but people inherit money all the time
Lately
It's been going on for a long time
Here in Norway the booth has piles with ballots for each party
You choose your party's ballot, then there's a list of candidates where you can strike the ones you don't like, and upvote the ones you like (and even add candidates from different parties from the one you vote for)
Seems much easier to me than this gigantic
thing
What a magnificent feat of engineering
Two
So you're just plainly admitting to voter fraud
The booths have curtains (sort of like those changing rooms in clothing stores), and you put your ballot in an envelope before putting it into the thing
I assume you need some kind of proof of authorization though, right

Question for the Finns here, and sorry if this sounds ignorant, just curious
Is the Finnish language related to any of the Sami languages
I don't know a lot about any of the languages, but to my ears, they sounds similar
Estonian sounds so nice
I don't get it
Swedes have no say about finnish and we don't think finnish is ugly
Finland is its own country and stands as an equal partner to sweden in the nordic cooperation

Since when does having more cases make a language less crude
Complex and diverse are not the opposite of crude
Refined, elegant, tasteful would be the opposite of crude
I'd hate to think you find caseless languages unrefined, inelegant or untasteful, considering German is well on its way to losing the genitive
>In 2012, Norway and Sweden reached a joint agreement to increase their production of electricity from renewable energy sources by 28
4 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2020
Wait, Norway is, and has been for the past century, 100% hydroelectric
Why does Norway never get the credit when we are literally breaking the tables and producing more clean energy than we use
[1]
Meanwhile, Sweden's arrogant brother in the West(Norway) is and has been at 99% renewable energy for decades
That's right, Norway gets 99% of our energy from renewable(hydropower)
I am not saying this just to annoy Swedes(partly) but also because I wonder exactly what the difference is between Norway and Sweden
Why is Norway able to do 99% but very similar Sweden with even bigger rivers etc
can only do 65%.
Is it our mountains, higher rainfall and glaciers
Most likely that's a part of it I'd say but there has to be something else too
That can't be enough to account for such large differences
We're similar enough that it should be much more equal I think
Is there anyone here who works in hydro in Scandinavia who can answer that question
Wonder if the forest fires put a dent in their carbon emissions
Because of our oil and gas exports
We reached the 2030 goals in 1930, we're just waiting for the rest to catch up :)
On a serious note, hydro electricity tends to be excluded from these goals, as well as nuclear energy, although both are as good as infinite in source
I assume it is because they want to develop new technology, and hydro electricity requires very specific geographic conditions, while e.g. wind turbines can be used almost everywhere
Same reason nobody pats you on the back and commends you for your hard work when your family is rich as fuck and you never really worked that hard at all
I think you need to dig deeper
Norway is the home to one of the largest aluminium companies worldwide, [Norsk Hydro] and [subsidiaries] It has operations in some 50 countries around the world and is active on all continents
The whole reason we started building hydro power in Norway was for this kind of heavy industry
If you drive a BMW, Audi, or Volvo you probably have aluminium parts from Norway (or from a Norwegian company)
[Kongsberg Automotive] provides world-class products to the global vehicle industry
The Kongsberg group makes everything from missiles to aircraft parts
[Elkem] is one of the world's leading suppliers of silicon-based advanced materials with operations throughout the value chain from quartz to specialty silicones, as well as specialty ferrosilicon alloys and carbon materials
The company's 27 production sites are found worldwide, but most are in Norway
No, what's the point in trying to PREVENT bad shit from happening, right
> Sweden has harder geography for renewables - though still favorable ones - and as such it requires more effort to reach a higher share of renewables
You mean like 90% of Scandinavia's biggest rivers
Most of the big rivers start in the Norwegian mountains and go East yet Sweden has failed to take advantage of it despite being richer than Norway until the 80s.
Its not like Sweden doesn't have huge potential reservoirs for hydro-power either, their country has a shitton of long skinny lakes perfect for damming
Still, we have it better geographically and climatically no doubt but by how much
Not enough to account for the huge difference in renewable energy between the countries(Norway 99% vs
Sweden 65%)
I mean Denmark has a better number than Sweden and they have no mountains or real rivers
That's not how it works
Your family might be rich, but you can still do a good job
That's just fucking retarded
Like beyond retarded actually
How is building a wind turbine more impressive and hard work than building a hydroelectric station
How is having favorable wind conditions hard work
Nobody worked for those winds, they are just there
Same with hydropower, those rivers and waterfalls were just there, no work required beyond building a hydro plant
Do people honestly think this is something we just build after we got oil money
Norway has been infamous for awesome hydro power plants since way before oil was even discovered
Norsk Hydro who specialize in hydro power was founded in 1905 for fucks sake
Rjukan ring any fucking bells
It had the worlds biggest hydropower plant since the 1930s when Norway was poorer than Sweden or Denmark yet we're somehow spiled rich cunts
Fuck off, move to Sweden then ;)
But it's still good
If we export more, others use less fossil
And just because our industries grow, somehow our growth in renewable production is neutralised
Stop buying gas, oil and petrol, and we'll stop exporting
Sooooo, you telling me that all we have to do is like take 100 something cars of the road and that would result in something like 10% decrease in emissions
You might be onto something here
Explain how we should get so much credit for having gone for the convenient and abundant hydro power route since basically the beginning (ruining a lot of nature in the process), compared to other nations who have been relying on different methods but are now going over to the more sustainable types for the sake of the environment
We have no right to whine about fucking credit
I was referring to the fact that we're a small country in a giant fucking waterfall, so obviously we've got hydropower
We'd be stupid not to
Imagine if you are the richest country ever to exist in the history of the universe
And then you manage not to give the people living there heath care
We could have been far worse, that's something
While I fully understand your sentiments and good intentions you're ignoring the real need and demands for fossil fuels in the world
You're not denying Norwegians more money, you're denying Kenyans further development (as an example)
There is an increasing need for energy worldwide and there's no viable replacement at the moment
Kenyans won't be buying Teslas any time soon, so solar and electricity are not viable yet
They still need to get to work, etc
I fully support stopping oil & gas extraction, but we have to think about people outside the developed world
> it is best that ... they are extracted in poor countries
In theory, I would agree, but in practice the poorest countries rarely benefit from such resources
Look at Nigeria, Angola, etc
Which is why Norway offers a programme called [Oil for Development
] Through this we help developing countries benefit from their resource by establishing the legal framework, management and investment structure needed to channel the revenue into the country's coffers - and not corrupt officials or int'l energy corporations
> the vast majority of world's remaining fossil fuel supplies must remain in the ground in order for us to be able to deal with climate change
I don't think that's realistic
Yes, we must change, but I don't think you understand the world's energy needs
We must first of all make other energy forms more viable and efficient, so that oil becomes less economically attractive and feasible (extraction costs)
Leaving the oil is fine, if there are better alternatives, and we can cover the energy needs of the entire world
If we were to stop extracting oil today, just the rich countries, you would see a crisis of enormous proportions
The oil price would reach unheard of heights
The poor countries would suffer, as only the richer countries could afford to pay the new prices
The world needs vast amounts of energy and fossil fuels are needed for now

I would say Danish is quite close to gibberish
Even for Danes it can be hard to understand, as seen in [this] Norwegian documentary
icelandic might not be mutually intelligeble but as a norwegian i still understand alot of it, even in written form
i think it’s similar to french and italian for example
The maker of the original one is Finnish or Finnish-Swedish so it's kinda weird since she should know
Is nau used at all
Maybe she used it to make a point about Finnish being different from the other Nordic countries

eesti doesn’t fit into nordic though, it fits so neatly in baltic making it nordic would only be confuse
Finnish flag on the tail make it look like a benis :DDD
Word of god is that there's one tiny enclave of Estonians left
Such a strange theory to have
Was this long ago
Iceland has naturally been more isolated over the centuries than us, who have been run by the Danes and Swedes plenty of times, and Sweden and Denmark were closer to mainland Europe and continental influences
That's bound to affect the language, as anyone with ears would know

I refuse to accept that Sweden beat us at something, but I also believe my family alone is enough to drag down the national average
Most people here are pretty good at English, but some are just dreadful
Edit: looked up the exact numbers, Sweden's index is at 625 while Norway is at 624
So this map is kinda misleading but oh well
Bet a Swede made this
bruh
There's no way that Germany should score that high
And there is no way Norway should have as low proficiency as Germany
I have visited Germany quite a few times
It always surprises me how shit they are in English
They have a world class education system
Its me, I'm dragging the whole country down with me
Sweden's index is at 625
Norway's is at 624
We're literally one point down but the crossover point is COINCIDENTALLY set at 625 to make Norway look worse
I bet a Swede made this
We're 624 and Sweden is 625
Literally 1 point apart smh
We have a score of 624
A score of 625 would’ve marked Norway as black as well
Sweden have a score of 625, Finland and Denmark have a score of 631 and 632 respectively, so it’s pretty close
It's all the Swedish immigrants bringing the score down
Probably the older people
English wasn't mandatory at school before 1969
With regards to younger people, I would say Norway should have a much higher score than, say, Finland should
Eastern Norway being eastern Norway
They seem physically incapable of speaking English without a "hødi dødi du" accent

[They definitely tasked a swede with setting the cut-off values

Unfortunately most Danes nowadays seem to speak English automatically with Norwegians as well, often with the excuse “vjii dånnth øjnderstæjnd Svjiiidisj”. You probably have a point in that Norwegian out of us three is a golden ratio, just in the middle between Danish and Swedish
I’ll never succumb into speaking English with a Dane though, I’ll rather try to speak with potatoes down my throat
I was *zinking* about how much of a coast guard Germany have, then googled it and guess what the top results are
I'm sadd af rn
It is
There you go
I think this a lot of times has got to do with being embarrassed of not speaking fluently, and not because they can't speak English well enough to help you
According to a link below Norway got a score of 624, Sweden 625, and Denmark and Finland were 631 and 632 respectively I think
The difference isn't large, but the cut-off in color between 624 and 625 makes this seem like a much more dramatic difference than it is
They were probably Swedes
That's a real "bruh" moment if I've ever seen one
Well at least we try to keep creative with our language and not steal every word we can from English like you guys
Norway got 624 on the index and Sweden got 625
We were on the verge of greatness
Yeah, Sweden, suck it
Ask your fellow Danes
It's very common
Too common
I was once at a wedding with a Danish girl
Her family and me and my BF were the only Scandinavians there, so we used a lot of English in conversations with others, but I tried to speak Norwegian to her when I was talking to her alone
She more or less refused to speak Danish to me, and she was 'afraid of not understanding'. I tried to tell her that it didn't matter to me if she asked me again, that I'd try to speak clearly, but it didn't really work
I've seen this multiple times
People who are afraid of trying because they don't like admitting that they haven't understood
That said it happens the other way around too
I hate it when my fellow Norwegians to it

Allting er greit
I reckon it's a result of simplifications, learning to differentiate when to use "I" and when to use "me" was difficult enough for misuse to be common
A lot of words and phrases have been misused often enough to become common, without most folks being able to explain why they use them the way they do
Moreover, English is widespread among speakers of other native tongues
For instance, as a Norwegian, to my knowledge the correct way of phrasing "this is I" would be "dette er meg" - however, "meg" is directly translated to "me", whereas "jeg" would be "I" and create the sentence "dette er jeg", which on its own means nothing
If I were to add more words to create the sentence "dette er jeg sikker på" meaning "this I am certain of" it is perfectly valid, while "dette er meg sikker på" is just as incorrect as "this is me certain of", "this me am certain of" or "this is I certain of
Perhaps most of the common errors in grammar applied to English comes from conflicting grammatical rules of native tongues
Norway currently has over 2000 cases of covid-19

We're not a member of the EU, but we are still EFTA members and we are in the European Economic Area (EEA)
Basically, we're still a part of the single market that the UK wants to leave, and we have to adhere to most EU laws that the UK don't want to adhere to (and we have neither a say or a vote in the EU parliament; the UK's special relationship to the EU also means that they have opt-outs from some huge stuff even as members)
Brexiters don't want this
Nor should they, since the UK likely wouldn't benefit much from such a relationship, other than getting to tick the "UK left the EU" box

Yes I got the N-word Pass
Ni***
*teleports behind you*
Dresden is rightful polish clay
Thank god for NATO
1 killed and several wounded already reported
Man, this year
Edit: Multiple suspects still at large, Police urges people to stay off the streets and public places
Stay safe, guys
This is not the start of the week we wanted
I'm sorry Austria that this spread to you
Jesus fucking christ, why
I'm getting so tired of this
The odd thing is, most terrorists wants the world to be more hateful
So, I think they are winning
Sadly
~~Retaliation
I guess this back and forth is gonna be the new normal, good thing~~ we have politicians in Europe who knows how to ignore problems
Edit: Mixed synagogue with mosque
Yeah my bad, I somehow mixed synagogue with mosque somehow
Yeah i'm fully aware, hence I edited my comment
Nah I prefer strikethrough, shows what people replied to
Being black is not a sin last time I checked
Why are you comparing men who have unhealthy sex with each other with people with black skin color
You're obviously a closet racist
While you're right about divorce the rest only applies to Jews (European countries are not Judaistic)
For the record, eating pork isn't gonna give you STD or AIDS so you need to work on your comparisons
I want to go there
It looks nice
Fukushima caused thousands of unnecessary deaths
Not from radiation
From Germany and Japan shutting down nuclear plants, which lead to more coal, which kills people
It’s likely true though
Just total up all the emissions from coal and gas plants that replaced nuclear plants closed (Or never finished) due to protests
It depends of course on how you define “single biggest”, obviously you could say capitalism or coal power is, but if you wanted to pick out a single social movement I think they’d win
Yeah absolving the 70s or 80s greens of responsibility only makes sense if you say the alternative was using almost no electricity, but that isn’t what the anti-nuclear movement of the time supported in the majority
Saying it’s not their fault because they were just against nuclear but not for fossil fuels is much like barring Jews from all other work but money lending and then saying it’s their choice to become money lenders
I once was on the same flight as the Norwegian queen
I looked around to see if anyone else had noticed, and everyone just kept reading their newspaper pretending they didn't see it
(She came in with her whole entourage so you couldn't miss it if you were in front of the plane
) I like it when the higher-ups are doing casual things

Now that is just way too pretty
Is this guy still alive
not to make fun of him or anything, but its a bit ironic hes using an ak-47 as an "anti-communist fighter".
Norway might say it's quite secular but there is still a suprising amount of Christianity in this country that most people seem to forget about
Confirmations are still a large part of growing up (yes, thats a *catholic* tradition in a *lutheren* country
There's even non religious confirmations
), things shut down on Sunday and religious holidays (Whit Monday which was this week shut most things down except the Sunday stores and the garden centres (idfk either)), and schools still offer things like christmas mass and people go (for referance, I'm in VG3 so don't you start about how thats an 'old' thing)
Less and less people are actualy religious but they still all celebrate a lot of the things you're meant to do as a christian
(and it kinda sucks
getting ahold of alcohol around easter is no easy feat between all the bottles closing early and everyone else rushing to get their booze and if you run out of something that isn't haalal or you don't want to comprimise on quality on Sunday or, god forbid, *christmas week*, you're fucked)
Thank god for that
Wait
Norway has a lot of people who are “Christian”. As in, they were born Christian and haven’t bothered to do anything with it since
Probably amounts for A LOT of the people who fall into the Christian part here
I dont believe the Norwegian one for a second and I'm in that age bracket
It wouldnt surprise me if Norways numbeers were to sway even more to the non-religious side due to many not bothering to cancel their church subscription
Not a single Muslim in Tsjekkia
(Czech rep
> Because there are significant diffrences in culture and history between 3 baltic states, which we do ignore, because they look to us, as the same size and location
Which in itself is very interesting
That 3 small countries so close together have such different languages and cultures
Did people there travel less than Scandinavians for instance
In other words, did Norwegians, Swedes and Danes mix more in the past compared to the Baltic, since we have much more similar cultures and languages
Or is it because Denmark and Sweden ruled over Norway for many years, and had more influence that way
Surely someone must have written a book about the history of the Baltic cultural differences
If not someone needs to
At least I think so
Vikings were everywhere first
Just go with ananas
will this affect non EU members too
Shit, what can I do being Norwegian
Will Norway be affected by this
It will indirectly affect us but will we also be affected directly
Did I mention why I don't like the EU
Do Norwegians have a say
Don't vote for any of our politicians who support Orwellian surveillance (DLD, digitalt grenseforsvar) and copyrights schemes (anything advocated for by IFPI), or who will approve all EU directives without protest (Ap, Høyre)
I'm really torn about the EU
While I respect the goal of making another war between European countries pointless, and that it makes us collectively a comparable competitor to the US and China both economically and militarily
I even enjoy seeing EU's antitrust system wrestle down Google and other mega corporations when they do something wrong
But I **really** don't like the idea of being ruled from so far away by people who don't understand my country
Plus, most of the countries in the EU are total shitfests when compared to us and our neighbors
I worked in Ireland for a few months and the living conditions were pitiful
I'd never want to see EU living conditions spread further into Norway
I personally think joining the EEA was just a bad deal forced upon us to even be able to trade, with a constant looming threat of an expectation to eventually accept being ruled from Brussels by Europeans
I've tried to understand the EU multiple times, visited the website and just generally looking it up
But as a Norwegian I feel like I even understand the US government better
I'd personally rather leave your incompetent grasp than become a full member
At least after seeing recent developments
I used to consider joining the EU to be a potentially good idea
But not after my time in Dublin
And it's still burning at full speed
So not as bad as I thought then
Am I the Only one seeing a unicorn and a lion humping the crown
That's in Andalusia right
Its really beautiful
I'm a little sad now, if covid hadn't happened I'd visited this spring
Now I'm not expecting that I'll ever affording travelling anywhere outside of my region ever again
Mabye I can stretch it to Murmansk
As a Norwegian currently studying in Scotland, I can personally attest that it is not free for all EEA members
I have no idea where OP got the idea that it is free for Norwegians from
We receive support from the Norwegian government to study abroad, but we still pay international tuition fees
Well, compared with other "developed" nations, £9000  per year to study somewhere like Cambridge or Oxford is not bad at all considering many Americans pay $40,000+ per year for average uni
New recipe Irn Bru
New recipe Irn Bru is not to love
They could make all UK universities tuition free and probably not face any resistance
I can see Scottish tax payers not being okay with everyone else coming there for the free universities, for as long as their kids can't go study in England, Wales or Northern Ireland for free
> The Scottish parliament could agree to pay a Scott's tuition if they went elsewhere in the UK as well as the tuition of any England, Wales or Northern Ireland citizen in Scotland
Switch that with England/Wales/Northern Ireland agreeing to pay tuition fees for the English/Welsh/Northern Irish if they study in Scotland, and you'll see what it would actually take for it to be equal
Fucking awesome
Those builders know what the fuck they're doing
Happy to see they go back to the original look instead of modernise it
Well done
It does seem like Muhammad should be portrayed everywhere, to desensitize people to the idea of it
The father didn't want anyone to look at the Muhammed drawings
But now he has caused thousands and thousands of people to google them
He did what
2020, what a year
This will give the far right quite some fuel
Let's hope this does not boil over
Fear is a weapon of mass destruction like Maxi Jazz once sung
I like what the Danish social democrats have done regarding immigration and integration
I hope we can emulate that too
If that is a link to that photo, It should surely be marked [NSFW]
TIL: Russians don't curse
Why include Turkey, but not Russia
Russia is a lot more European than Turkey
- Norwegian: The Devil
- Danish: Poop/dirt
Huh
As a Norwegian, I more often use the word "føkk
" which is a norwegianized version of "fuck". On second place is probably "fetta
" which means "cunt" in north Norwegian
"Faen" is too mild a word and is probably quite far down the list of most used curse words for me at least
Denmark is just "dirt" or in the gross parts it could be interpreted as "shit" in norwegian
Denmark is swearing as if they're in Mickey mouse clubhouse
Faen
This was done by a helvetes hestkuk
Faen my ass
Uuuuuuumh what’s going on with Spain
They seethe
In Norwegian “Jøder” means “Jews” so if anyone unironically uses that as a curse word, some eyebrows are definitely going to get raised
Actually the Norwegian one is OK because it's probably our most used word
I'm guessing the same goes for Sweden because it's the same word
But Denmark LOL
Hey, I'm guessing from your flag that you're a Finn
Do you really use vittu more than pärkele
Faen is a name for a/the devil, and at least some of the Norwegian idioms with faen reflect that meaning
E.g. "Faen ta deg" - "May the devil take you", "Faen holder hånden over sine egne" - "The devil protects his own", "stakkars faen" - "poor devil"
But granted, it is also used in a lot of ways where the literal meaning of the word doesn't make sense (the same way fuck is used in English)
These is no "faen" in Iceland
Interesting
I think it can be more accurately transcribed as following:
Dane: * indecipherable sounds *
Swede: * blank stare *
Bringing the popcorn
I see
Thank you for enlightening me
[Little Saturday]
Tsjekkia has always been the official name for us so I find it pretty natural to write
Where can I buy tshirts/sweaters with ESA on them
It doesn't even matter AFAIK
911 works in the EU, 112 works in the US
It's just automatically routed to the correct number
Pssh, 000 is *much* better
When in doubt, 112
Oslo Airport and a lot of other Norwegian airports have free water-stations where you can fill up :/
I am at the 5
6 in Norway
It's 14 c here in my part of Norway
It's too
warm
What this tells me is that by the time global warming has killed off southern Europe, Norway will be quite nice and balmy
Can I have some
We were supposed to pull out our coats

People here started wearing [these bad boys] in mid August
Nah, this is basically T-shirt weather here in the Nordics
What are you even talking about
It's 20C around Oslo, which means shorts and singlet
Double digits are honestly too much
I was nude on the beach in Troms, sunny day today so why not
Clothing for any weather according to my mom:
35C - I'm literally dying
30C - I'm literally dying
25C - I'm literally dying
20C - I'm literally dying
15C - I'm literally dying
10C - you look cold, put on this sweater

That would be pretty fahr-fetched
Work how
It's not like it was build with traffic in mind
It's not like the design should be considered bad because they didn't plan 200+ years into the future
If you mean "is the design recommended for adopting in modern cities currently being built" then the answer would be no
Got nothing on former Norwegian PM and [Secretary General of NATO]

To be near
Russia has the most nuclear weapons in the world
I'm scared of what will happen if that country collapses
It's not only the nature of the civil war that worries me but the   consequences of institutional collapse
I bet their nuclear infrastructure already are old and faulty, like their deadman switch
Who knows how many nuclear warheads might disappear and might end up in terrorist hands
And the missile silos are already old and leaky
A civil war in modern Russia is really a terrifying thought
Hey norskies we are officially off the hook
Norway
Media is often used to say what can’t be said diplomatically/officially without creating a fuzz
Wraeclast
This is
true
This is just how media often work, both in Russia, the west or China
That means 12 pornstars in Norway
Anyone know who they are
(The 11 that aren't my mom, obviously
Apparently we've had 12 porn stars since 1999

The Norwegian equivalent:
- The critically acclaimed first season
- The even better second season with even more action
- The even better third season with the plot branching out
- Fourth season was ok
- The new head writer for the fifth season decided to kill off half the cast, completely ruining the show (black death)
- Sixth season bought up by the Danes, they made it into a shitty soap opera
- Kept going as a shitty soap opera for 3 more seasons
- Tenth season bought up by the Swedes, made some improvements, still a soap opera
- 11th season it tried to get back to its roots and succeeded, although with much less action, however the last 3 episodes clearly had insane amounts of money thrown at them
- Ongoing season is looking promising
Hmm, I'm not sure if the audience on the British isles loved the first seasons
Looks like Norway - even down to the stripes on the asphalt
Yes
Looking forward to spring
Italy, uomo
Fucking Italy
Let me in
Holy fucking shit
I can even see the lake I live by in Norway
This is eerily accurate
Slowed down version, please
I live on the edge of a forest, and 8 min drive from the ocean
Perfect
Must be all those mountains you have
quality maybe
Google "Putin dogs Merkel". Angela Merkel is afraid of dogs, Putin brought a huge dog to a meeting with her
We have the same here
Not so good for the spread of the disease
Here they're closing stores because there are no customers
Though I think we're further along
Ah, fuck me
Why the fuck is the EU so bad at regulating tech
At this point I'm sure they would've banned color TV in the 50s if they could
I doubt they even understand the legislation they're voting on, in fact i think MEPs in general don't understand the vast majority of what they vote on
They're presented a huge amount of text, much of which they have no education, experience or other means to properly understand
At the very least all MEPs who voted for this, and all parties who voted in majority in favor of this, need to be blacklisted and not be voted for in the 2019 election
If this passes the final vote, then the next step is to have it removed ASAP
Whata fuck are they doing, they ruined internet once now they deliver the final killing blow
Old conservatives who don't understand the internet fucking everyone else over
When they release which MEPs voted for and against, I want you people to vote correctly next time, and not get those bastards into power, I mean we fought two fucking wars against each other, of course we can change those bastards
As one greek dude said “stupid people shouldn’t vote on things”
This disgusts me
These fucking idiots have no idea what they have done
Do you expect someone who just managed to pass something they wanted to pass to cry
Every legislation pass is a victory
Every legislation that is voted down is a victory
Norway still hasn't officially ended the trial of colour TV
> And the liberal party in Sweden wrote MORE EU on their ads ahead of the election
And they gained a whopping 0
1%.
That remains to be seen, but it could be brought to Norway through the EEA in the form of a directive we have to implement into national law
Not that it will matter much, all the internet giants will conform to the law and apply it either globally, or for Europe as a whole
Hush, don't tell KrF
I'm still worried they'll propose to close the internet on Sundays
What made the greens gain popularity
I read somewhere that German greens are very moderate and pragmatic
Our greens worship elves, want to enforce veganism and generally live in a dream bouble
They also want to phase out oil and stop flights between Bergen, Oslo and Trondheim
I did a double-take when i saw where you're from, as i did not recognize your description at all
Our green party is generally heading in the same direction as the Germans, even if they are a few years behind and not as anti-nuclear - they are gaining popularity for a reason, and that reason isn't Tolkien fans
And cut Norways exports by almost 40%.
Nuclear power would mean the end of Russian gas, and thus the end of the russian grasp on Central and Eastern Europe
Slovenia is at 0
48 but not colored white
Error in number or coloring
Main story on the news here for a while now (besides Covid-19 and US riots) is a *potential* murder case
(Missing wife who were planning a divorce, and filthy rich husband claims he has no idea what happened to her)
Speak for yourself
It's OK
I always mess up Slovenia and Slovakia on maps too
Norway forgives you
Nah, Norway is the cod capital of the Nordics (and vaccines)
We're good ;)
Over my dead cod
Just imagine how many homicides they would have in the US if they didn't all have their own private arsenal

Hey fellow Nordics, how do you feel about a common Krone instead
Norway, Sweden, Denmark and we could even have Iceland and Finland join in if they are up for it
wierd that it’s mainly euro countries that are for it
all the countries without it are against, and czechia for some reason
We don't like it and we don't like you
Losing the peg wouldn’t result in a high national rate at all
There’s really no comparison between the situation then and now
Devaluing against your neighbors is one way to increase exports and protect domestic industry
You obviously can not do that if you don't control your currency
Well yes, making foreign products more expensive to buy and exports cheaper for foreign countries is two sides of the same coin
Both gives a boost to domestic industry
You guys are getting sun
Scandinavian didn’t want to join this summer I see
I'm always we ays confused by why these map always chose to show northern Africa, but not all of Europe
Only about 50% of Scandinavia is shown
Iceland, not at all
We feel none of this heat
I suspect the "heat" is a conspiracy used to control Norwegians and try to make them enter the EU
tmw you live in northern norway
Ahhh thank God I live in Norway <3
Fucking RIP Spain
Hopefully Madrid won't be too bad, grandma is old and don't tolerate the heat very well, though thankfully they have aircon
My girlfriend's gonna melt working 12 hour shifts on Mallorca
Higher humidity over there too, so Jesus Christ
The weather remade the Roman Empire
Yup, looks like we will reach 20 degrees up here
Time to go to the beach
Norwegian here, this is officially the coldest July we've had this century
Many places all the way at the southern tip (where I live, and where it's supposed to be warmest geographically) are yet to break the 20° mark
It's currently 13° and raining where I live and I'm miserable
I want my summer weather, dammit
Fixed up my boat for nothing
South coast of Norway here: yes
love my chilling 10c......and rain
Yeah all of Norway right
All 2000 km of it
You guys should probably expand [your existing general reforestation projects] even further
Look at countries like Pakistan, planting millions and millions of trees
You bastard
South coast of Norway here: absolutely not
Me too
Couldn’t imagine having it so hot here
I would rather have 15c and rain than 30c+.
A bit south of Bergen, no
We're having floods:
No, the east
It's been like this the whole summer, except or two weeks in June
Most look exceedingly happy
Yeah, map of Europe, but doesn't show Iceland at all, and only parts of Scandinavia, but does include North Africa
Poland is upside down^/s
I honestly couldn't care less
Its literally just balls with eyes colored after their respective flags
Uninteresting and overdone at this point
What would actually be cool with be each country's national animal colored after flags, or something like that
The sami in the north
And Iceland
Those apples look tasty
I would take a bag full as well
This is what irks me when people complain about "wasting food". Yeah ok, lets say we remove 100% of food waste
Now you have 50% of the farmers and a large portion of the food industry out of business and a recession on your hands
Great success
There is no lack of food, only a lack of customers
It's always estonia that does these awesome things

How does the presents come out of the log
Older part of the road = fine
Newer part = not so fine
Why were we made like this
It's like 18 degrees outside and I'm figuratively burning to death
You can use them for energy efficient heating in winter, so it's slowly becoming a thing in Norway at least
(heat pumps)
Not ground heat pumps
Those are way more expensive to install
They're great but not common at all
I'm talking about air-based heat pumps
Speaking of
I'm actually surprised at how many Swedes didn't know that H&M is Swedish

(Brent currently at $57) Except the 2007 price was a drop from the 2006 price, and grew to over $120 over the following year
While today's price is comparatively stable, after recovering from the drops in late 2014 early 2015 and again late 2015 early 2016
>  user installed apps and a wide range of connectivity (3G, BT, Wifi)
Nokia did have that tough - I have a N95 from 2007 which has all that + GPS, and came preinstalled with Google maps, Opera browser (+ their own thing), and I installed Skype + a few other things on it
It was pretty decent, especially compared to the first iPhone, which did not really have apps (they had fancy bookmarks), 3G connectivity, copy/paste, ... - it's main features was a touch screen and a slightly better browser (but slower network), and iTunes
In 2007, the top Nokia phone was still ahead of the top iPhone
In a lot of countries the current oil price affects the price of directly oil based products
In Norway the current oil price determines everything: market conjuncture, job market, interest rates, even trends in education and the political situation
Paying attention to oil prices is just prudent if you live in Norway
Oil prices are often mentioned on main stream Norwegian news during times of changes (i.e. they're not hidden away in the economy section)
With last weekend still fresh in our minds, may I express my hopes that it has an up-to-date fire suppression system to go with the spiffy new exterior

Damn i feel like a 90 year Old :/ what Does this pixel meme mean
How do you toss out the old corrupt ones and not just replace them with new ones
Ask Ukraine about how well the "revolutions" worked out for them, they keep just getting shit politicians in place of the old ones
>It makes me very sad because I still remember my grandmother telling me about hunger during the Second World War
Shouldn't you be happy that we have the opposite problem
I mean, it's still not optimal, but noone is starving anymore
I just usually just ask the people who work in the grocery shops if they have anything they're planning to throw away anf if I could have it instead
And usually they agree because to them thats better than me digging it out of their garbage where all of their customers pass by
For my work i need at least 3000 calories a day, otherwise i lose weight
Also, that's a massive improvement over the 1940s. More people live by not starving than die due to the pollution
Sure, we need to improve, but we also need to appreciate just how happy we should be to be doing so well
See
In the Netherlands they just *hate* bikes, but no-one's listening to me

Literally the entire Scandinavian area does this
We do the same in norway but at 14:00
Ive done it my whole life
We have the exact same thing in norway
Same in Norway
My town in southern Norway has gotten a total of 5 sun hours this month
Same thing in Norway, pushed myself up early in mid November because the forecast said clear skies after having it rain for weeks
That's the last time I saw the sun
Could you post one without the white bars, and just the original subtitles
From just this image alone you could very easily have faked those subtitles, I know you haven't but just saying
Wait, is that greyed-out road between Norway and Sweden intentional
Secret level exit
We have fences here in Bergen (norway) with loads of swastikas on it in the middle on the town center
My grandfather (Im also Norwegian) supposedly played with German military equipment after the Nazis left
There was a lot of cartridges and other stuff around, and the kids were like "OH SHINY" and went with it
I gotta ask my grandma if she has some of this stuff
When I was in the army we still had some Nazi war loot
I had a flare gun where every part was stamped with swastikas and eagles
When you lose a war you also lose all your stuff I guess
Also there was a German bunker about 20 m from my parents house
Most common hunting rifles in Norway are all Mausers with intact swastikas, Reichsadlers and Waffenamts after all
My father-in-law is rumored to have all manner of things the Nazis left behind, including radio equipment
I can't vouch for this, because I haven't seen it, as the man is a wee bit of a hoarder and his work areas would make Reodor Felgen suggest it's time to clean up (end Norwegian in-joke)
See, most of Norway was never retaken
The Soviets liberated Finnmark but the rest of the country remained occupied until 8 May 1945
Terboven in fact had an idea that Norway should be the site of the Nazis' last stand, which fortunately didn't happen
But that also means they didn't retreat, they just ran, and there was no time to pack up things that might help the enemy
They left all sorts of crap behind
Are you talking about the yellow building in " Christian Michelsens gate"? If so; it's not swastikas
See the [municipality's website] for the explaination
oki im corrected
I'm 32, so this was over 10 years ago
There wasn't much of it still around, but some odd bits like the flare gun and some sights for artillery was still in use
I believe someone had some parts for an M42 as well, but I may be misremembering
We don't use any German small arms anymore save for some very few converted Mauser K98ks
The Norwegian firm Våpensmia at Dokka made some sniper rifles based on G98/K98k receivers designated NM149 and NM149F1
They got pretty much everything but the bolt and receiver swapped
Nowadays it's mostly replaced by the HK417 anyways, and you can only find it in the worst equipped parts of the armed forces
I guess flare guns is the only thing that still sees any normal use, plus maybe some tools
Japan is light years ahead in terms of candy development

It has been 30 from primary to high school at least in my experience
Does this show students pr teachers or actually average class size
Because I'd say student pr teacher is much more Interesting and important for the students
For Norway students pr
Teachers in primary school is 15
Couldn't find anything reliable on class sizes

I'm a Norwegian, we have pretty big classes
My class from 1st to 7th grade had about 50 students, all other classes in that school ranged anywhere from 30 to 60
Other schools in my area were the same
I have a couple of originals on the wall :D
I was reading EVERY A&O comic I could get my hands on as a kid, borrowed a bunch of great comics from my uncle
I'm actually considering buying the complete series of A&O, C&H and a few others I read as a kid
We definitely had them when i grew up
Not my personal favorite but I'm sure most people remember them fondly
Oh man my childhood right there
Me and my grandmother used to watch them in german and she translated everything to norwegian
Great times
I know who they are, but I never had any comics or books about them as a child, I think the first time I saw them for real was the actors motion picture about Egypt or Babylon or something
Tintin was the hype, I had tons of comics and audio tapes, movies, and even those infamous ones when he is in Kongo
They showed the swedish dubbed version on TV and it was well voiced
Great comic, don't know why it never fully made it overseas like in Europe
It's interesting how the statistics get better the more south you get
Maybe the weather and climate plays a bigger role
I can't recall the source at the moment, but I read that a sizable part of the difference between men and women is the preferred method
If you compare the rates of *attempted* suicide men and women are a lot more even, but for various reasons women more frequently survive their attempts
To be fair, openly criticizing Putin counts as suicide in Russia
Damn, life is sad in Russia
> It's interesting how the statistics get better the more south you get
Maybe the weather and climate plays a bigger role
This is a good reminder to remember to eat our D-vitamins/tran (can actually boost mood in winter) Also interesting that Norwegian rates are better than in France
And looking at west/east money and oportunities seems to play an important role as well
Typical women, can't even kill themselves properly
Research shows that in societies where there is nothing else to blame (bad government, etc), people may actually end up taking their own lives because they have no other excuse
Yes it does
Interestingly, there's another aspect to that:
"[Past] [research] has shown that residents of Tromsø, northern Norway have lower rates of wintertime depression than would be expected given the long winters and high latitude
In fact, the prevalence of self-reported depression during the winter in Tromsø, with its latitude of 69N, is the same as that of Montgomery County, Maryland, at 41N," Kari Leibowitz, a PhD student at Stanford University who spent a year in Tromsø studying the residents' mental health, [explained in the *Atlantic*]
In the fascinating and lengthy article, Leibowitz recounts her time spent in the far north, explaining exactly how Norwegians get through months and months of dark days and brutal weather relatively unscathed, as well as offering tips that can help you be less miserable this winter yourself
Apparently, your mood all comes down to [your mindset] \-- not what it says on the thermometer
A researcher I heard speaking on the subject said that in societies where there is nothing else to blame (bad government, etc), people may actually end up taking their own lives because they have no other excuse
That's a strong claim, do you have any evidence for that
I don't think you know us at all
Up here in the far north we're outside regardless of weather and season, we are known for roaming our forests, seas and mountains all of the time
You'll find people between 8 and 80 years old swimming, trekking, walking and skiing all year round
We really love being outside, while you guys have to hide from the sun ;)

As the owner of a STASJONSVAGN, I've accompanied many non-scandinavian people to the local (Swiss) IKEA
Knowing a scandinavian language definitively makes the store more insteresting to visit
Especially the food part - for example the herring stuff is all in sweedish (except a small sticker with french translation of the names of the additives)
First thought: at least they're using the proper status code
Second thought: ehh they're actually subverting it because at this point it's their own choice to not serve the content without tracking

people who blame columbus, a single man, for the actions of empires need to go back to the school bench
saying columbus can be held responsible for genocides when it was infact the british, spanish, french and portugese empires along with the americans who did all the work is a little disingenous

We have a tradition for eating cream filled buns around this time as well
Funny how a lot of countries kept the "fatten up" part leading up to the Lenten fast period but then skip the fasting bit, I'm not really aware of any Christians who actually practice the 40 days of partial fasting/dietary restrictions following it at least
Finally a holiday i can get behind importing
Nice
Yup
And my Polish colleague brought a bunch of these for lunch today
Edit: For all of us
Pfannkuchen translates to pancake
That name makes no sense for these buns
We eat tons of these, especially in the north during the period when the sun returns after its absence during the dark winter period
During this time they're called Solbolle (sun-bun)
Usually 3 variants are sold; Sugar outside, no filling
Icing sugar outside, vanilla cream inside
Icing glaze outside, raspberry jam inside
Both Lutheran, so that doesn't explain it
Either our "fast" starts 2 weeks earlier, or it lasts 2 weeks longer
Wow, TIL

Okay, I'm probably going to get downvoted into oblivion but this is my opinion after all
I really don't care about the Notre dame fire nor whatever happened here because they are only buildings and never injured or hurt anyone
Every existing building, whether it's new or old, will eventually disappear sometime
Why worry about buildings burning down when there are so many more important things to worry about, such as terrorism, cancer, wars or natural disasters
And now they expect us to donate money to rebuild the church
How will bringing back a building make the world a better place when the money could go to for example research or healthcare

000 children, but how many pedophiles was involved
Kind of ironic that the police seems (at least earlier) really reluctant to tackle both the prince and the immigrant pedophiles
(Just watched ["The Prince & The Epstein Scandal"] and I was very surprised by the fact that the police knew about prince Andrew's crime years ago but decided not to investigate)
> I refuse to believe this is an England-specific problem
Wouldn't be surprised if the same issues were prevalent in France or Germany and other countries but that the British media is simply more open about this stuff
The UKs ranking in the [World press freedom Index] is actually lower than both Germany and France
In fact UKs ranking is the lowest in western Europe
> Immigrants in France are from Maghreb and Subsaharian Africa, not Pakistan nor Bangladesh
I recently watched a documentary about pedophiles in Pakistan
And they mentioned a survey done including 18
000 Pakistani men
30% of them saw nothing wrong with child abuse
30%! So it shouldn't be a surprise that some of them bring this culture to the countries they move to
Edit: [Source]
Another thing is that Germany has [more press freedom than the UK] So German news are more likely to report on these things
..or the royal family
How has the prince Edward thing affected people view of the royal family in the UK
Our princess is dating a shaman, which has made more people talk about rather becoming a republic
So I cant even start to imagine what sex trafficking would do to people's view on the royal family
> There was & is nothing illegal about sleeping with a 16 year old in the UK
Morally wrong, and extremely sleazy
Definitely, but nothing legally actionable
So sex trafficking is legal in the UK as long as the girl is 17 or older
I find that quite horrifying to be honest
> Edit: We may also benefit from having different countries using the same language
In particular, there is high quality German speaking press in Germany, Austria and Switzerland
With this, you can reduce the blindspots even further
Doesn't seem to make a difference since the [countries on top of the World press freedom index] speak languages not spoken elsewhere
I just think its the level of influence government and corporations have over the press
(The less the better)
Finland are you OK
Let's mention **Time zones** in the discussions of these maps

I feel bad for UK, and i really don’t want the EU to change its stance, but Norway is said to be one of the worst affected in a no deal scenario so I am really nervous about this
Especially since I live in western Norway, who, according to the heatmap posted here recently, is going to be worse off than the rest
What are you talking about
Norway is the worst affected by a soft Brexit where they join the ETFA
We do not want the UK into the EFTA
Currently this is pretty much a special deal where Norway is a big player in how it's working along with Switzerland
Do you know what would happen if the UK joined
It would quickly become the UK shitshow agreement
If the UK wants a deal with the EU they should make one just for them, the EFTA should remain for the smaller countries
If Scotland leaves the union with England they would be the correct size to join without tilting the balance of powers, however they would probably opt for a straight EU membership
The UK has no place in the EFTA, they are too big and need their own deal to avoid ruining EFTA for the smaller countries
I don't think the UK would be pleased with the EFTA currently anyway but the UK into the EFTA would be a huge blow to EFTA support in the smaller countries currently part of the agreement and probably a step back in regards to getting the small countries to join EU long term, something the EU would like
I read 1% decrease in BNP
Did not know they wanted into the EFTA
Thought they wanted an independent arrangement within the EEC
One could hope, but sadly no
There is no debate in Norway about joining the EU
There is, however, a debate from the outer left about leaving EFTA and EEC and sail our own way, much like the UK
Thankfully it is not widely supported and only the parties left of AP (labour) are for it
AP and H (conservatives) are both rather positive to the EU, but are for now happy with being in the EEC
They have talked about it as one of the possibilities, it would be really bad for the current members as it would greatly reduce the balance of the agreement between them

i work in tourism and almost exlusively all the americans i meet are anti trump
i guess the stereotypical american doesnt travel and stays ignorant
Come to think of it, I've met a lot of both German and American tourists while travelling myself, but I can't recall ever meeting a single Russian tourist
The German tourist is inaccurate
they think all beaches are nudist beaches
Trust me on this one
In Norway, German tourists clog up our roads with their wohnwagen from May trough August
Bring all they plan to eat or drink from home, so they don't have to spend a cent on food
Overcrowd our fishing villages all year round
Stand in their rental boats while fishing, and if they manage to not capsize and drown, return home with hundreds of kilos of fish fillet
Non of them wear lederhosen, as far as I've seen
That's interesting, because most of my adult relatives in the US seem to be pro-Trump
From California to the Midwest
Most of them seem to be quite well off, educated and traveled
We're talking middle aged and above, lawyers, engineers and other professionals
Now, some of the younger crowd seems more anti-Trump, but they were also New Yorkers
I've seen plenty of wealthy Russian tourists in Spain, but you have to go to the better hotels/destinations
Normal Russians generally go to countries that are cheaper and hotels that are all inclusive
Norwegian tourists typically don't share the same hotels, mostly since there's no capacity left

Maybe the US is a bit more negative, though other than that I cant think of anyone
I'm surprised Denmark didnt rank higher
I wonder why
From what I've seen in the news princess Mary who is Australian is very popular over there
The rest of the Scandinavian royals don't register
Only thing I could think of actually
And that Sweden gave them cheapo furniture through tax shelters
Maybe they rank a little below the rest because of all the awesome Nordic noir exported there

The roofes are made of peat laid on birch bark on top roofing supports/planks, this is the traditional way anyway
Today we would have to dig up every single peaty bog to roof everybody
It also only works on sloped roofes, as a flat roof would be turned into bog if not drained properly
It's not hard to understand why many people here in Norway quickly adopted the metal sheet roof or stone shingle roof when they became available
Bog roofes don't need changing in a long time, but when it must be changed, it takes a lot if work
Metal sheets or shingles is much easier

Germany is not reducing their dependency on coal, they are increasing it
Norway has no coal plants here we just chill with our hydroelectric power
Nah the norm in Norway and likely Sweden as well is to either heat with electricity or by burning wood
My parents have an above average home and burn about 4-5 tonnes of wood each winter
I don't think this is uncommon
It also happens with many other types of goods, like oil and whatnot
Why do you think this is due to corruption
It certainly doesn't make intuitive sense, but from how I understood it, its more about how economics and trade works
Anyone with some insight on the subject
It does sound unlikely
Oh yeah it's crazy to heat with wood in cities
I have no insight, I would just question the economics in opening a new plant and close it a few years later

I'm glad they're doing it publicly, and I'm glad they're looking into modernising the laws regarding illegal content online
Systems across the web are wildly different, and many of them simply don't work, or are overzealous to the detriment of users
"Filtering all uploaded content" is also a very vague term, and it's not necessarily bad
I'm gonna have to see more information on what that entails before I make up an opinion on it
I do like that they're talking about user interaction with the systems, it'd be nice to have a legal framework for how to handle reports of illegal content on a site
The time it takes for the system to process said reports is often too long, YouTube in particular is faaaar too slow to respond to counter-claims

Those "other countries"(which includes Wales and poor English areas btw) are countries that the UK has *free trade* with, and thus the UK directly benefits from those countries being helped with projects that make them more productive and thus able to buy more goods and services from the UK
I came up with the idea that my children can stay up 30 min longer if they spend that time reading
Now we borrow new books for them at the library almost every week

Here is another good one: when sitting around the dinner table, ask your children to give you one high and one low from their school day

I have a brother who has dyslexia, and this would not have worked on him
But audio books can be a good alternative

My daugther will also read during the day
So she reads one book in 2-3 days
My son does not read as much outside the 30 minutes, so he spends more days per book
I'm the only Norwegian I know who does this
My son doesn't like reading much
He prefers his computer
But he loves Sci fi
So I borrowed a lot of sci fi books for his age at the library, so he has been reading those
He still prefers his computer, but at least he is enjoying the books when he read them

Rain would be good
I'm from outside Bergen, When Norwegians hear Bergen, they think rain
last year we had something like 180 days of rain
Now, After months of drought, [this is what our freshwater supply looks like at the moment
Water levels now drop 7 cm per day, and It is expected to run out in 3 weeks or so, and still no rain in sight
If we have to import water from other parts of Norway, we will never hear the end of it
The fuck
It DOESN'T rain in Bergen
This is truly the end of times
I'd say both
Due to the instability in climate caused by increasing the CO2 concnentration in the atmosphere, more extreme weather situations are likely to develop until the climate stabilises
I would say it is an extreme situation, Like i said, Last year we had something like 180 days of rain
According to the local news paper, the last time this happened was in the 60s, unfortunately the population has more than doubled since then, and the local government has been lagging behind in expanding the water supply, because frankly, the idea of a drought anywhere near Bergen sounds like a joke
It's a football metaphor

The Sami language is one of the two official languages of Norway (Norwegian and Sami)
There are many Sami languages though
The Sami languages are taught in Norwegian schools, these days everyone learns the alphabet in elementary school, but only a minority choose to learn the full language
It's official in a few municipalities up north
There's a Sami parliament supported by Norwegian law, and funds are available for cultural preservation; including public radio and TV in Sami
- [The Sami language news] by Norwegian public broadcasting (NRK) is shared and broadcast by Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish public TV
Hasn't corbyn been anti brexit for months/years
Not from the UK but this isn't exactly new to me
I guess it's maybe cause part of the left is usually pretty anti Eu
I guess he knows the same way you know what 'every brexiteer thought'?
I doubt the guy you replied to is a politician, though he refers to himself as a brexiteer
I also doubt brexiteer usually refers to a politician
Should've included the city pictured on your pass on the map
Have fun travelling, though
What places are you going to visit
I wholeheartedly agree
Such a nice way of seeing Europe
I even know people who went inter-railing with their children
I can see my fathers house in the picture below
Looks like it's my town, Trondheim on the cover

Yes, it's Trondheim :-)

Great link, thanks
Interesting to see how the US ties with Denmark and beats everyone except Luxembourg and Switzerland
Everything is cheaper in the US except healthcare
They have it quite good there even though we Europeans pretend they are a developing nation at times
Meanwhile, despite our oil sector beefing up the economy, we're still below Denmark and the US
Might be because they left out the private sector
Don't think it would up the number that much to be honest but I think we would be slightly ahead of Denmark and the US
When some off us buys a new car, almost 50% off the money goes to the state as different taxes
That's the price off the car + 100% off the cars value in taxes
So trust me cars don't cost the same in different countries in Europe
Yes, it's probably not as bad when you [consider purchasing power] however all the people who dont manage to have jobs on standardized pay scales will still be poor
There was a great article in a norwegian newspaper about these areas a while back and they had this [graph] showing that the UK has both the richest and the poorest areas in Western Europe (adjusted for purchasing power)
Avearage pay for teachers in Norway is about £50k a year, and a little bit outside the big cities you could probably pull all of that off on a single salary (though it would be tight)
Congrats :)

How terrible we have suppressed the Sami people and how we forcefully assimilated them in order to “fit in” with the “Norwegian culture”. And how the racism against them still exist very much to this day
They are still treated horrible by Norwegians and we are barely learned anything about their history in our schools
The [Jew clause] was the second paragraph of the Constituion of Norway when it was written in 1814
It specifically banned Jews and Jesuits from entering the kingdom
The clause roughly translates as:                       «The Evangelical-Lutheran religion is the state's public religion
The inhabitants who practice it are obliged to raise their children in the same
Jesuits and monastic orders may not be tolerated
Jews are excluded from access to the Kingdom»
The article was not deleted until 1851
Yeah, pretty much the same thing happened in Norway
yeah the ‘one language’ policy of france is really sad
so much diversity lost when there was no reason for it to be
>we are barely learned anything about their history in our schools
Really
We do learn quite extensively about the Sami, including Norwegianization
At least in the school I went to
wait that’s where ‘saturday candy’ comes from
we have it here too, i never knew it was a scandinavian thing and not a more global thing
i guess i’ve just never thought about it
Then you were lucky
I learned nothing about them in primary school(barneskolen) and learned a little bit about their language in 9th and some about their religion in 10th grade
I wish I instead had your school
There is a lot of general racism like removal of any signs that have the Sami language on it, or comparing them to clowns and other horrible comments
However while their have been improvements, there is still systemic oppression
Most prominent in the fact that many schools don’t adapt for the Sami people’s right to have education in their language
This means that many Sami languages are on the verge of disappearing all together, and they are directly oppressed from their rights
Research has also shown that 50% of the Sami people in Norway have experienced discrimination
Edit: wanted to add they are also highly underrepresented in multiple platforms, I.e education or media
general racism
they’re treated equally by law, and now also have the right to preserve their own language and culture, but there’s still tons of racist people
especially up north because of ethnic tension
alot of sami move south, don’t even know their language and completely abandon being sami, which is sad
the sami culture is pretty awesome imo
It has gotten a lot better today
They have their own “council” where they vote for stuff and alike
Although they can’t make anything go into action there because they are only coming with suggestions
Luckily most of the things they come up with though goes through without problem
The not so fun part of the Sami is that most live in Oslo
And that many of their writers and alike actually write in either of our two languages and not their own
Ahh yes
That is horrific
We were showing what would happen if you were a “tyskertøs» (meaning german slut) by having pictures of girld having theor hair cut off, and having their clothes ripped off
we didn’t learn alot in primary either, but we did during highschool, especially when we had about northern languages and norwegian language history
i don’t think you’re supposed to learn any of that before at least like 8th grade or smt
idk though, that’s just speculation
There are approximately 40,000 Sami in Norway, and most of them live about as far from the cultural center (Oslo) as you can get
In comparison there are almost 100,000 Polish immigrants
I definitely wouldn't say they're underrepresented when they make up less than 1% of the population
There have been several prominent Samis in the media over the years
Also, the point about the schools is just plain wrong
No matter where in the country they live, Samis have a right to get their education in Sami if they so wish
That being said, there's no doubt they have been discriminated against in the past, but it's definitely going in the right direction
Blatantly false narratives like this doesn't help at all however
That's most likely just a myth
huh
do you know if the tradition is common outside of sweden+norway
outside scandinavia/the nordics
We learnt about some of this in 7th grade, but definitely not enough or even close to everything
this was my source, you have to scroll for a while to find the information on underrepresentation
And here was my source on issues in education that takes place in the Sami language
yeah that’s definetly true either way
we don’t really learn enough about our ethnic minorities and their culture and language
like, i bet most norwegians haven’t even heard about Kvens or Forest Finns
The point is that most Sami live about as far away from the Norwegian cultural center as northern Italians do
You could argue the exact same thing about anyone living in the north (and the districts in Norway often complain that the media is Oslo centric)
The report states that Sami who ask for education in Sami are getting it
The problem is that a lot of the non-Sami districts simply aren't aware that it's a thing, which makes sense since for most of them it's never going to be an issue
But it's given when asked for
I haven't had time to read the entire report, so what do you consider to be the major problems from it
well considering we just go to you’re country and buy kilos at a time i’m not surprised
but for real, i had no idea it was that much compared to the rest of europe
like i thought the netherlands was bad
do you know what those stats include
chocolate, chips, seigmenn
I actually hadn't heard about neither of those
Just goes to show how bad it actually is
We also basically don't get any LGBTQIA+ education in primary and secondary school
We have our own media in Northern Norway though
I dont really feel like media is a problem
I dont live in Finnmark or Troms, but here in Nordland we got NRK Nordland, for television news, and lots of smaller and bigger newspapers
that’s true, it should be rolled into sexual undervisning
apperently we eat 7
6kilos of salty snacks every year
but that was in 2007 so idk how accurate it is nowadays
Absolutely
And the sexual education should be made longer
From 5 days to a month or something, to get a more in-depth knowledge of it
That way we could maybe get more deeply into it instead of skimming over it, and we could go over more stuff
yeah absolutely, the only thing i remember about it was our school nurse came in with some dildos which we obviously just dicked around with, and they gave us some condoms
lmao same
I think I was the only one actually interested in what she had to say and learn anything
And yeah I also basically don't remember anything, and I had this in February this year
^^dicked ^^around ^^lol ^^nice ^^pun
i was struggleing with the wording of that because usually i would’ve said ‘fucked around’ but in the context that wouldn’t work, i aslo thought about ‘played with’ but again, it’s wrong haha
hahaha, yeah 'fucked around' and 'played with' could have been taken wrongly
We could do with a longer coastline
Sorry, Sweden
Italy, now we have the Vatican island
Sweden
Italy because Italians are the worst, loudest, and most annoying people in the world
What about Andorra and Gibraltar

15 weeks paternity leave for dads is pretty good
€100 paid out per child every month to every family, regardless of their level of income
We got the same in Norway
All of my bottles and cans get recycled because of it pretty regularly in fact, so it's quite effective
That is spectacular
Well done Poland
Way more popular than I thought then
This adds to the list of things that makes me proud of being European
Oh you have it too
Cool
Nice
There have been politicians here talking about only giving it to families that actually needs the money
But I have come to the conclution that I prefer it the way it is
That way the families who pays the most taxes (both parents in high end jobs), also feel they get something back from their taxes
But that is just my personal opinion of course
Here it lasts till the child is 18
Not working though, less and less children being born
I personally think we need to change parent leave back to how it was before (someone's going to shoot me for this
) when mum had more weeks than dad
Many mothers feel it's too early to go back to work when the baby is only 7 months
And it's not like dad can breastfeed, or drive the baby to the workplace every time the baby needs food
(Ok
I said way more about that than I planned
Congrats on your independence Scotland
Want to be a part of our kingdom next
I'm honestly impressed
I thought he was so far out there that he would never become PM, but then again I thought the same about Trump
Thanks for the oil
A few months after we got independence, we were invaded by Sweden and forced into a union for almost a century
Bruh
thanks for the oil
When the british successfully provoked Germany to invade Norway in order to justify their own expedition to stop the supply of iron ore
Then, when they were about to crush the germans at Narvik and potentially keep Northern Norway free, they went home, leaving us to 5 years of occupation
Maybe the UK causing Germany to invade us by sinking a German ship near us I guess
(WW2)
Im sorry

What, historians agree Hækkerup was not Danish
Poverty in Norway wear many faces
It can be the kids who don’t seem to have what the majority got in terms of clothes, toys, electronics, holidays, sports memberships, other activities and experiences
It can be the immigrant worker who traveled here to get a better life and wage than at home, but in general and reality is exploited living on bad conditions, working illegally long hours and given salaries way below average for their work placed in a shitty accommodation
It can be the single mom who works an over average good job, but strives getting her ends to meet and sometimes has problems feeding her children and giving them and herself all they need, she got bills to pay including rent and payments and service on her older car
It can be the sick one who lives off benefits because he’s too ill to work due to unfortunate circumstances, maybe having kids to care for, maybe not, stuck in a council flat in a smaller town or in the middle of nowhere
It can be the Somali family consisting of mom and her children who’s dad got killed in the civil war living a few blocks down or maybe next door, she speaks better and better Norwegian now, but nobody will hire her except for shitty low wage jobs, the immigration department and social services office play games with her she can’t ever understand because of language and cultural barriers
It can be the lovely older couple down your street, the old grey haired lady who spends the whole summer trimming and caring for those magnificent rose bushes and flowers, they barely get by on their minimum pension
Due to our welfare system, no matter how poor you are you still have access to housing, transport, and are able to pay basic bills and buy food with some budgeting
You might buy second hand clothes for your children whenever possible
You still have access to healthcare and higher education
You’re probably a student living from a student loan of roughly 900€ a month
Rent is probably 450-700 € for a bedroom in a shared apartment
That should leave you with 150-300€ left after rent, electricity and insurance
Food is anywhere between 100-200€ and then you might have 50-100€ left for beer, clothes, subscription services and other costs
In the larger cities you’ll need a part time job to live comfortably
When you finish your degree you’ll have roughly 21000-35000€ in debt
It Can also vary a lot depending where in the country you live(mainly due to housing/rental prices)
But as you said, it can depend a lot
There are definitely homeless people though, I have seen them
They walk around the with a shopping cart filled with all of their belongings(blankets mainly) and empty bottles and cans
They dig through the trash, and sit on benches the majority of the time, before they head over to their chosen sleeping spot for the night and hope no police will find them
It’s very sad
Officially, students are explicitly left out of the poverty statisitcs
Absolutely, some of these tendencies are more prevalent in Oslo than elsewhere, especially since it’s the most expensive property market
I also forgot to bring in the homeless and particularly Rumanian beggars who live in absolute poverty by several measures
The few homeless people are mainly drug addicts though, and sometimes not willing to quit
Generally, at least as far as I understand you will be provided free housing as long as they know you won't be using the place for doing drugs etc
Many of them are simply not able to really live in a home
Romani beggars are probably a different story
One of the many exciting challenges that comes with student life
Less meat, a lot of pasta and noodles and cheap bread
It is fully doable if you cook everything at home and plan dinners in advance
No, university is free apart from books, so student loans are supposed to cover your living expenses
Well, we’ve probably had some of those reportages here as well, but I doubt that counts for all or most of them really
My point is what we see here in Norway, the conditions they live under here aren’t worthy and pretty shocking
That means regardless of why they come here or even the question of if they should come here or what they should be offered here
Toro and knorr are probably the most common
Yes, i have forgotten some norwegian words so i prefer english and if i'm writing norwegian i mostly use autocorrect to help me if i do anything wrong,
I am learning german and wondered if the germans have problems with the gramar since it seems so complicated, so know I now
Tror ikke det er tillat for øyeblikket
I'm pretty happy with my own, though i try to figure out how to learn a real, as-native-as-possible general London accent
And then a Dublin-like accent, I struggle more with that
I'm also just happy with it because I think the Norwegian accent is one of the least sexy accents out there, imo
I really don't want to sound typical Norwegian, and although I don't mind sounding foreign, I just have fun learning accents, and it's a skill goal to nail one perfectly
Yes but actually No, i don't have the "normal" accent but i still feel very uncomfortable speaking it even tho i swear almost every second
I can speak with a Norwegian, British, Indian and American accents, but I consider the one I speak normally as
normal
I think the accents that's from an English speaking country is cooler than my normal accent
Norwegian here
I've been living in the UK for 8 years now but my accent is still noticeable
It can be irritating sometimes, but mostly I like it because when I meet new people, they can never tell where I'm from
I've gotten American, Italian, French, South African, Austrian, New Zealand, and so on
You'd be surprised at how confident people are when they guess too
Always pretty funny and a good icebreaker
Lived in Australia for 5 years, married to an Aussie
Yeah, I don’t mind sounding like an Aussie
No I dont like it
Just look at Norwegians who try to speak english on YouTube
My experience as well
No one ever seems to complain about accents
(If you happen to misspell an English word on reddit however
I know people who "need" an iphone because "its the best phone". I also know people who earn very (!) good money who owns a android phone
And because more people than not have iphones here, I make sure I don't. How else will I teach my children that your value as a person is not in buying the most expensive thing
Iphones are like a trend in Norway, the more people that have them, the more are going to buy them, because they are not compatible with android
A lot of people will buy the newest iphone as soon as it releases
Personally I hate Apple and won't touch their products with a 10ft pole
In my social groups, it's pretty much the same as this, except the last point
If a guy has an iPhone, he's definitely more likely to be considered a bit of a tech dummy though
I'm certain there's a large gender difference as well
I dont even know what whatsapp is, dont think any norwegians use it
This is spot on
I'm the tech support in the whole family, and people with iPhones are fucking useless with tech
Two of the groups are mostly university educated and two of them are mostly not, and it's the same across all of them
If they're tech savvy, they have an Android, if they're not, an iPhone
With some exceptions of course
Same here in Norway, also young people use snapchat
Pretty much the same age group here
Mid 30s to early 40s. Price is only relevant as an argument against wasting money on the (sometimes perceived, sometimes actual) inferior product that is the iPhone
The city I'm currently studying in, Førde, is widely considered to be the ugliest in Norway, due to the shitty weather and dull, blocky buildings, even though there's been built quite a lot of new, prettier buildings recently
The surrounding nature is very pretty tho, and the sunsets here are usually very pretty
Reading through the comment have made me want to visit Urk
I’m probably gonna be dragged for this by my fellow norwegians, but I’ll have to say Oslo
That’s where 98% of all the shit in this country happens
I’m not from Oslo, but I’ve been there a hundred times and I’ve never liked it there
You can read about gang violence, murders and stabbings going on down there all the time in the news
I also think it’s a quite ugly town
It’s a concrete soup in a hole between boring hills of pine
If you want to visit Norway and see what it’s really like, please avoid Oslo
Oslo doesn’t represent Norway at all
That’s my opinion
Bergen
It's not the city just the people
They are great, but they are way too loud
Drammen, in Oslo’s outer suburbs
There’s a big, quite ugly bridge on the largest highway in Norway that cuts right through the industrial/port part of the city
Also the rest of the city used to be like the part seen from the highway bridge: heavily industrialised, ugly, run-down and dirty, but a major urban transformation project in the last 20 years has turned it into a very nice place to live and visit
The reputation from old times has however stuck
There is a saying in Norwegian: «Heller en dram i timen enn en time i Drammen
» that means «I’d rather have a shot of liquor every hour, than spend one hour in Drammen
» («dram» = a shot or small glass of liquor)
>the city has ENORMOUS problems that nobody seems to fix
What kind of problems
Is it problems that could be fixed quite easily, but it doesn't happen because of the politicians, or would it take a lot of time to fix
Pekey fokin blinders
You're just scared of Danny
Very unlikely, as far as I've heard, but no problem
Pre-1970 Førde was a smaller farming town with just a couple hundred people, and large industry didn't really pop up until then, so even though Førde did have a sizeable German  presence, with bunkers and checkpoints and whatnot (And it was the site of a pretty big dogfight between Allied and Luftwaffe planes, The black Friday), but it didn't really lead to any major developments in the cityscape, aside from the building of an airport I believe
The "real" reason Førde became "ugly" was the very quick development and establishment of large, more industrial employers, like the shipyard (Ankerløkken) and the county's largest hospital (Førde sentralsjukehus) and shopping malls (Handelshuset and Elvetorget) which demanded large, modern facilities, which coupled with the more practical, concrete-y architecture that was common at the time, lead to a blend of really jarringly blocky and bland looking buildings among older residential houses
I'm paraphrasing here, but it's what I've heard anyway
Pretty sure that's Moldova
No worries
Heh, my dad is from the Molde area
Yes, but you have to compare that to the purchasing power parity
How much do you get for those 440 dollars a month
That's just one good though
Things may be expensive, but Moldova had both the lowest HDI and GDP per capita of any country in Europe
[According to World Economic Outlook and the Human Developement Report
For winter months, sometimes having to shovel snow out of your driveway in the morning or scarping ice from the windows work, even if I don’t use a car
West coast country side Norway here
It wasn’t unusual for someone to excuse themselves by being late to school because they had to catch a sheep that had escaped
Wasnt even a fake excuse, for anyone owning sheep this wasn’t too rare
Snow
On the car
In the driveway, on the roads
Snow everywhere
I had a sunday-driver (slow car) in front of me
I have also used tractor in front of me as an excuse some times
I'm from norway (how do I get thise fancy flags on my post
Ice on the windshield yea, that's a classic and one I've used myself for being late for work
The guy with high salary working from home
We are that one super hypocritical guy that makes the company go through an incredibly tedious bureaucratic process just to buy environmentally friendly paper because it makes them feel better about themselves and then drives home in an SUV
What a great question
I have laughed so many times reading though the comments
The rich guy who drinks a lot of coffee and works 3 hours a day and takes fridays off to go to their cabin
We’re the jolly bouncer
Whenever any of the other countries are fighting, we come in and break it up
And who always takes Fridays off to beat traffic and go to the cabin Thursday afternoon
No, that is France
Sweden is head of HR
No no, [Architect] or some sort of hipster furniture designer
Not any more I guess
Three months
This'll end
I live in the south - here people don't like to travel far, so many own a cabin just 20 min from home, in the same 'kommune'. So they still spend a lot of time there
France, you're fired from the job as a union representative
Position now given to Denmark
Three months, beginning from the first of the following month
So if you tell them the 1st, you'll practically have to stay for four months
No, three months is three months
The whole system is built up around it
Employers hire people three months in advance
I just got a new job, but won't start until August
That's the standard here
Some countries, like Denmark, has a dynamic work market as their ambition
Norway is all about job security
Letting people go is extremely difficult as well, if it is not because of economical issues
You can't just fire someone because they suck at their job
There has to be meetings, documentation that warnings and extra learning/teaching measures have taken place and that the employee still suck at their job after that
Letting someone go because of their shitty performance can take a year, so many employees just give up
There's a test period with every job, though
Usually it's six months
Sacking someone is usually a lot easier then, and the notice is shorter as well
Well, often you have some saved up vacation you can use to shorten the time, and like you say it's possible to reach an agreement, but apart from that 3 months is 3 months
yea, definetly
colour and color, flat and apartment, lift and elevator

Sometimes I say some things wrong and say it the American way, but I am quick to correct myself
> people often say I write as if I try to sound smarter than I am because I use "big words" but I think that's just the result if you learn English mainly by reading instead of by speaking it
Also they're being anti-intellectual dumbfucks, so who actually gives a shit what they think
[This comes to mind
Strangers talked to me for no reason
I could be walking on the street and a total stranger would come up to me and say "nice jacket" or something similar
Did a road trip with my family through many states in 2011
Specific to New York: the insane height of the buildings
We have a couple of really tall ones in Oslo, like Radisson Blue, but this was on another level
My neck hurt looking at them
Also, noise, but I've also experienced Cairo and Cairo is worse, much worse
In New Orleans: I ordered a "sandwich" called a Po' Boy, and I got a *massive* burger-like thing with probably a whole packet of ham in it
I think I managed to finish half
So yeah, the size of things too
And sooooo much sugar
In hotel rooms: we didn't watch a lot of TV, but when we did, I was very taken aback by the amount of commercials
I watched Cartoon Network as a kid and I remember the screen faded to black and immediately back to whatever I watched like every ten minutes maybe (usually during an exciting part, for dramatic effect)
I realized those blackouts were meant for commercials, but my home country didn't do that
And also commercials for booze
And just in general the *intensity* of them
Some were hilarious though
People: obviously since I'm from Norway, the intense friendliness and people talking to us was a bit weird to me, but I got used to it, and started liking it actually
People gave us compliments and shit
And I remember I was buying something and I was like four or five dollars short and the guy said "nah, it's fine" and I was just like "serously
". People don't really do that here (at least where I'm from, Oslo, people might be more open do a few friendly discounts outside the city)
It feels better when the people talking to you just do it naturally and, even though it might be superficial, they seem to mean it
Also related to that, I mentioned this was in 2011, which means I was there during the 22
July terrorist attack
So many gave us a very genuine and heartfelt "oh I'm so sorry" when we presented ourselves as Norwegian
Probably because they knew what it was like to experience a national shock due to a terrorist attack
So I thank them for that
The feeling that everyone is out to squeeze you for just one more dollar
Granted, I've mostly visited touristy cities (NYC, Miami, LA, San Francisco, Las Vegas), so it might be different in more rural/less touristy areas, but it was all sorts of small things which built up to this feeling, and it made me more wary when I encountered people who seemed friendly, because I'd automatically assume they just wanted money from me
And pretty much everything came with a prize tag
So weird to drive into a national park and paying at a booth to enter
Went first time as an adult to attend a huge tech conference
I hadn't that much of a cultural shock since I already know a lot of American culture from literature and movies, but there where a few things I found amusing, disturbing or just strange
Visited Los Angeles autumn 2008, stayed in a hotel in downtown LA
The rather dilapidated state of public buildings and infrastructure
It's nothing near any third-world country I've visited, but things were more dirty and run-down than I expected
The state of things was more like something you would expect to encounter in some Eastern European countries
I had to wait a bit since my co-worker was held up in immigrationc, and while I waited I was pestered by lots of people asking about donations to different charities in the arrival hall
I'm no stranger to that, but personally I found them way too aggressive - in addition I find it a bit weird that I as a foreigner and non-resident am asked to support some local charity in a city I have no connections to
I'd rather give my money to some junkie at home instead of a strange pastor claiming to collect money on behalf of people I know nothing about
The vastness of the place
I knew Los Angeles was a big city, but I was in no way prepared for the urban sprawl
The number of homeless people
I literally had a guy staring at me through the restaurant window while I ate supper
Some of them just seemed to be really out of it, others seemed disturbingly coherent
I am used to homeless people, but they tend to be junkies or drunks, not people with mental illness or just unemployed
The number of people employed to do basic services
Doormen, bell hops, hostesses, servers, and such
Restaurants, service desks and hotels seemed overstaffed
Which is nice, but
The level of tipping
I get it, some professions live by tips alone
But that means that I pay for the service, and frankly sometimes it feels completely uneccesary
The need to do math at 2 AM in the morning while drunk to settle the bill
I don't want to stiff anybody for their earnings, but sales tax really adds to the confusion
The friendlyness of everybody
People talking to me, even though they're strangers
Which is very nice and cool, but sometimes annoying (especially if I'm hung over)
Flags
EVERYHWERE
The portion sizes
The price of petrol is ridiculous
But the biggest shock for me was how friendly everyone is
Even if its fake I quite like it
Depends on what state
In California i was surprised at how many homeless there were and that we couldn't drink the tap water
In Tennessee i was surprised how involved parents were in their kids lives
Even after turning 18 they are still considered kids as long as they live with their parents
It's like "as long as you live under our roof you will follow our rules". I also noticed how present the cops are everywhere
Police
Everywhere
And apparently what they were used for
I (22 at the time) was there (Utah) visiting my sister (17) who was studying abroad
We were out playing some sort of game, and they told me the cops would round teenagers up and take them back home since it was after curfew
I'm there like, aren't you guys 17
Apparently you're not allowed to be outside after 23 (or 11pm as you say) before you're 18
As someone who had been going as I pleased and doing pretty much what I wanted since I was 13-14, that blew my mind
Not my story but my friends, I think she went to Miami in Florida
And she said her biggest shock was how dumb and immature people was there
Also to add, some of their toilets have gaps in the front of the seats
Really really weird
It's like a horse shoe
My culture shock was also in a toilet cubicle at JFK
But my shock had to do with the doors of the cubicles, that had these wide open gaps where anyone could see through while you were trying to do your business
Made me very uncomfortable and I quickly got out of there once I noticed
I found that this is common in lots of public bathrooms in the US
That's interesting, because compared to Norway, the US is still incredibly formal
They use Sir/Mr/Miss/Mrs (or titles like "professor") and last names in many settings
In Norway, everyone is on a first name basis except the royal family
And that's not an exaggeration
But of course the US is super informal compared to many other European countries, like Germany (although I don't know much about Poland)
> Teens addressing adults by their first name
Wait until you visit Norway
And Sweden
And Denmark
(Not sure about Finland)
In Norway we call everyone by their first names
The teacher
The surgeon
The lawyer
The prime minister
Thats not commen in your country
Its normal to call adults by their first name in Norway
I would think it was really odd if some kid called me by my last name
>Lastly, the gap in the toilet doors
WHY
I would have understood a little gap, but it's so big
Being French you prefer kissing
Most exchange students experience this
But this is a symptom of social classes more than a quality issue
American high schools have jointed classes for all students till the age of 18, while most European countries have different systems for secondary schools, separating sometimes between 14 and 16 years of age
That means that most European exchange students come from the equivalent of *Gymnasiums, Lycees* or *Sixth form colleges*, where they prepare for university education
The academic performence of these students are already in the upper tier
In addition, those students that can afford a year abroad at secondary school is likely from well-off families were the parents have higher education themselves
That will most likely mean that they are among the groups that perform well at their schools
American high schools designed to catch all students aren't really that well suited to high performers and it would be unfair to compare
It's just that the American school system is different
The best US students move on to Colleges and universities too, and the US is home to some of the best universities in the world
> Then I realized that most american almost spend no time outside,
Warm climate
I remember my shock when I visited South Africa in March ones
And after a long summer the white people there hardly had a tan
So me coming from a long Norwegian winter (with no tan
) didn't feel awkward at all
Turns out they stayed out of the sun most of the time because of the heat
So they all had a outdoor area with a roof on where they spent most of their outdoor time, and almost didnt use the garden at all
>The only other place I've consistently experienced people being that considerate of lost foreigners is actually Norway
Wait, really
That's interesting
Would you say that's after Norwegians have been asked for help, or did the Norwegians offer help without being asked
I've been asked for help/directions etc
plenty of times and always help, but have never offered if I haven't been asked first
Yes
We don't really talk to strangers
Unless we're drunk
Haha it was actually just my high school letterman jacket
I had no idea you call it to be "cut"..
> The commercial thing was always annoying as a kid, so it’s lucky that you didn’t have to deal with it
There’s a reason why Americans have been so excited about streaming tv shows and movies with reduced or no ads
I had never thought of that but that really makes sense
Netflix must be a blessing for you guys then (not sating Netflix is not popular here, almost everyone uses it, me included, despite our VASTLY inferior library of movies and series compared to a lot of countries)
> You definitely get your money’s worth with the portions, especially for Southern food
I also have to say I loooooved New Orleans in almost every way
Yes I probably saw most of the more touristy places but those were some GOOD touristy places imo
And I almost cried when we were listening to live jazz in Preservation Hall, it was so beautiful
> I still find it ironic that the upper Midwest which has a massive Scandinavian-American population ended up one of the places with the friendliest people in the US
Hah, that IS kind of weird, but again a lot happens over generations
Guess I should visit the "Scandinavian" parts of the US to see how it is
I've also stopped being annoyed with the whole "heritage obsession" thing, it's honestly kind of cute to me (at least with the "Scandinavian Americans", I've no say in other nationalities)
Most public bathrooms in Norway is not payed for though, unless you live in Oslo I guess
And we don't pay for the ketchup at mcdonalds
Can’t remember seeing them a lot in and around Athens
But yeah, Greeks love Greece
I meant ridiculous as in very cheap
Sorry if you get offended, but that is what she experienced
I know that not everybody is stupid, but for my friend that was a culural shock
Genrally I find americans very talkativ and a tad naive
But for most part you are nice people
Wisconsin and Minnesota had super nice people
Even nicer when they found out I was Norwegian and they could ask me about a phrase their grandma used to say
New York however I could not stand
The pleasantries felt so incredibly shallow and fake
Was it just me being skeptical
And then the day after, you realize how obnoxious you must have been when you were complementing a stranger's mustache while in the 0300 burger line
Oooh yeah, I can totally see that happening
It's also normal for Norwegians to say hi to each other on hikes
There was this one time I blew a tyre and had to wait about an hour for help, and I was invited inside by someone who lived right by the road
I guess I've always looked at that differently than from just randomly walking by someone saying "good morning", "how are you" (which no one wants the answer to) and so on
But hey, I'm glad you think we're nice
I think the fact you were hiking is key here
Norwegians will not say hello to strangers - unless you meet a stranger on a trail in the woods or on a mountain
Then it is rude not to at least smile and nod
People hiking are more vulnerable and Norwegians recognize that because they have been in the same situation themselves, so they know how much a cup of hot coffee or a meal will be appreciated
Thanks
It's my favorite jacket though I don't often wear it
Haha you guys are then VERY similar to what I experience here in Norway
No talk about politics (even though our politics are hysterically boring compared to, well, anywhere), money, personal health and stuff (an exception might be abortion and same sex issues, bc it's not really a big issue here, so we're lucky there)
The passive aggressiveness is also a thing, or just odd and nervous ways to try to NOT cause an argument
> a couple tens of thousands still speak Norwegian (down from a couple hundred thousand a century ago)
Reminded me of, I study linguistics and I got to know of the language Amerikanorsk (American-Norwegian) that is almost identical to (Standard Oslo) Norwegian, but it has certain Englifications like they're saying "kas" (from because -> 'cause) instead of the Norwegian word "fordi", but there's literally like ten speakers left or something
Still, pretty interesting
> I’m glad you’re less dismissive of Americans for heritage stuff since a lot of Europeans seem to love to gatekeep that stuff
Hah, yeah, I've noticed that, at least on the internet (not necessarily that much irl mind you, just to give you some hope that Europeans don't all purely detest Americans
But also yes, their, or "our", opinions have not been in favour of the US since You-Know-Who had his presidency
But yeah, I'm sorry about those guys, they're very mean-spirited in how they write about an entire population on Reddit like that, there's no excuse)
But I mean, yes, it feels weird to "us" if a random American with a great-great grandmother from Norway approaches us as if we're one and the same, but like, what's the problem really
Isn't that just nice
Isn't that just being hospitable
My parents told of this funny thing when they went to the US for the first time (like thirty, thirty five years ago maybe) and they did meet someone who descended from a Norwegian like three or four generations back and he was like "we're practically family
" and were super inviting and stuff
Obv they had very little in common but my mom and dad remembers it with a fondness and thought it was both funny and sweet
And y'know, I've met a Canadian like that, and he had a very Norwegian name, but spoke no Norwegian, but he was very interested in anything I said about Norway so I was more flattered than anything
It's cute, it's funny, I can't relate to the heritage obsession, but my family also has literally lived here for hundreds of years do I have no say in what it means and feels to be a descendant of immigrants
Yeah the price level here is stupidly high
For all our progressive income taxes we make it impressively expensive to be poor
I'm aware of that, but we have a higher income pr capita then most european countrys
Thats why it's expensive
Average salary in norway in 2019 was around 56 000 £ a year, while the average salary in the UK in 2019 was about 30 000 £ a year (I'm using UK since thats is where it says you are from)
So there is a huge difference there
I feel like service here is mostly good
But it depends on where you go
We are tought not to desturb people to mutch because it annoys most Norwegian
In stores we whait a bit before we talk to customers, because mostly they get mad if we don't give them peace
To be honest, in England service was kinda shit as well
But I guess there is not really a culture for it
Or we expect different things because we grew up in different countrys
Well you are offended, and it shows
I don't really think it is
You see several people telling stuff they have heard from others here at reddit
The only difference here is that you got offended and disagreed with my statement
That is completly fine
Where we live, we grow up fast
She was in Miami, and all she heard was wierd statements with misinformation and dumb qustions
She did find respect for a cuple of people, they were very educated on their field and she admired their commitment
The rest apparently had alot of statements about things they had no clue about, and they were generally immature for their age
That is what we call dumb
To be honest I don't get why you get so defensive when it comes to Florida
Even you guys make fun of their intellect
Yeah, but we only pay about 10 more taxes then you so the difference is not to high there
I can probobly guess where you ate pizza based on the price, and yes, its a shitty pizza
The taxation on unhealthy food is really high here as a health mesure
But yeah, some food should be cheaper here
Eating out is more expensive because you pay for more then just the food
But at the pluss side, tipping is completly unnessesary
And most servers don't expect it
Alcohol is really expensive her to hinder people from drinking too mutch
If you buy the food at the store and make it yourself you don't pay as mutch as eating out
I'm curious to know what happened to all the refugees at the Turkey/Greece border
Corona made the news from there completely absent
I honestly can't think of anything
Then again I haven't paid much attention because of how hectic things have been
Luckily nothing, we’re pretty blessed in Norway
The only shitty thing is that, while the EU wants to make it illegal for companies receiving aid to pay bonuses to their CEOs, our conservative government will still allow it
Which is just like, wow
What the fuck, at 13
I mean I don't endorse nazism in any way but that's kinda impressive ngl
Same here, at least nothing that I'm aware of
Saying what
Probably T*ordis* for females and *Odd* for males
Beda, or Olga
Borghild is the most old people name ever
I don't think there's a single Borghild under 80 years
Einar is also reserved for old men
Still a thing in Norway
Almost everyone in my family has a double first name
It seems to be more common in rural areas though
I have an ancestor named Hardenack
Is that name usual now
It seems very old
It's a Hardenack life
Of these feminime names I know 4 that are under 20 named that
However Oda is not old fashioned in Norway, and Ingeborg isn't that ''bad'' either
It's a name I associate with older women, but I know many younger ones too with the name
It's just very common, I guess
I once knew a boy with the unfortunate name Odd Simen
Weird, Inge is a man's name up here
Can confirm, am Norwegian Sami
I think it might be more of a traditional Norwegian thing that has been most preserved in rural areas
In many ways, rural communities tend to be more traditional while urban areas tend to be more innovative
That would be my guess
This is basically how things work when it comes to language and dialects as well
Names usually come and go in waves
Names that were popular 100 years ago suddenly become very common again
I read something about it a while ago
Haha, Yngve is also a male name here
One of us is living in upside down-land
Shot fired
Embrace for incoming Italians ;)
Interesting
TIL
We do use Inga as a female name here
We also have Ingrid
We do use mens names as a prefix in several women's names, such as Ingeborg
We mainly sustain ourselves on our massive hydro electric industry, made by our massive oil exports
As long as we have something to replace it like nuclear power its completly fine
finally some sense
Yeah
I don't think that's true, all industries can be converted to a carbon-free model if we work hard for it
Aviation
More research on hydrogen airplanes, since electric aircraft are unfeasible with today's battery technology
Construction, due to inherent carbon emissions from chemical reactions in concrete
Just don't use concrete
Have your heard about ultra-dense wood
Google it
There are solutions for everything, we just have to identify them and work towards achieving them
I sometimes forget the Norwegian word and say it in English and I feel like other people hate it
No, but it happens quite often that I can only recall the English word and have to search for the Norwegian one
Which is kind of embarrassing at times
Only country ever to ban skateboards
dont have anything else i just really wanted to share that one
We have the northernmost permanent settlment in the world, Ny Ålesund on the island of Svalbard
We were a region of Denmark for almost 400 years and when we almost gained full independence we joined Sweden instead, all because of a complicated series of events relating to the Napoleonic wars where our patriots played a high risk/high reward game to gain independence
We are the all-time best winter olympics nation, having [368 medals, compared to second places US on 305]
We got our massive wealth of offshore oil fields because a [Danish minister] signed a deal with us whilst he was drunk (more of a myth but why not add it)
We are the only country to face Brazil in international football (soccer) and never loose once
2 wins and 2 draws
Salmon sushi was never really eaten in Japan, after a successful Norwegian marketing campaign in the 90s it's now probably the most popular kind of sushi in the world
3  Norway invented the cheese knife, the paper clip and the cheese slicer
Red Bull was banned until 2010-ish as well
EU forced Norway to legalize it
Aren’t skateboard allowed again now
why isn't luxembourgish an EU language
Someone else actually patented the paper clip first, so we don't technically have that one
But we did invent the aerosol can
And we banned colour TV for a while
I hear you did the same in Israel
A member of Parliament said something like "we accept that sin has come to earth, but we dont want it in colours" as a way to ridicule the people who wanted to keep the ban
They were dangerous I guess
My uncle had to buy his in Sweden and smuggle it over the border
Crazy to think about
My dad is from Tel Aviv, and that's what he told me
Might have been exaggerating
I don't think it was meant as a joke, to be honest
His supporters might have found it amusing, but the christian party (that were opposed to colour TV) i guess weren't so amused, mixing in "sin" and all
That there is an influx of bulgarian kids coming here
Eastern europe really seems to have a problem with our child protection service
But are these parents abusing their children since they are convinced child protective services will take them away
Or do they believe children are removed for no reason at all
yeah I know absolutly nothing about that at all
northing
What is gay
We belive the bulgarians will send us our required child offeri- i mean children in great need
lol nice il send em back for ya
Norway is the complete opposite of capitalist, we are taxed into oblivion and we do not have anything similar to a free marked
Agreed, Thousands of people don’t just get housing and everything they need including education without it costing anything
This isn’t some far right conspiracy like the others in this post
Oooh
This is about Bulgarians living in Norway
I thought they believed the Bulgarian child protective services took children away from families inside Bulgaria, and then sent them to Norway
Hence my confusion
friendship ended with sweden
now latvia is my best friend
That's not even remotely true
If anything we have a mixed system, lil bit communist, lil bit more capitalist
The major thing is that CPS only shows up in the news when someone there screws up (or gets accused of screwing up)
End result is that we get a blinkered sense of their performance
Name one aspect of the norwegian economy that is capitalist
Everything on the market is regulated by the government in some form, you can see this on for example the mva, tobacco prices rising almost every year, vinmonopolet
Few other modern economies are this heavily regulated
So calling Norway a mixed system is wrong
And don't get me started on our tax system
How have you it
I have it good at least
Norwegian sentence structure is close english
And now have we all become cavemens, this the thread is amazing
I believe that something of the difficultest with this excerise is those words that are untranslatable
As for example on Norwegian so have we word "sin/si/sitt" for possessions, like in "Michael sin bil" ("Michael's car"), but on English so is there no equivalent word and therefore is it sometimes impossible to direct translate such expressions to English
Ok yes that can I do
I am in the car with the father mine
We drive to the store
I walked me a trip to the store for a little ago
I bought me some snacks and beer for the weekend
Now sit I and shit in the toilet while I write this
I take me a shower later before dinner
In evening can it happen I take to play some computer-games, before I go and lay me
This seems as an interesting exercise
That only problem is that Norwegian grammar is very like English grammar
Norwegian and English are both germanic languages and English has also become influenced of Norwegian in the viking age to a certain degree
All that was was written with fully Norwegian sentence structure and that is this also
Oh, that listens like straight out of moomin land
Here in the mountains, have we actually a sauna too, at the university
But it is closed on ground of corona
I understand not what the message is
We call it storm-airing
"Sin" is more like 's, but as a separate word; "egen" is "own": "Michael sin egen bil" = "Michael's own car".
Yes
Norwegian has not noun cases so the word order must be rigid
But because of the v2 rule put you some times the verb in a different place than in English
We do actually have freer word order than English when you think about it, probably because we had several cases until quite recently
«That car have I not seen before» and «I haven't seen that car before» would be valid and equivalent sentences in Norwegian, but in English only one of them would be valid
YES, 100 %. As for the counter-arguments:
Q: Shouldn't sports and politics be kept separate
A: No, it doesn't work that way
Qatar getting the WC is a political and not a sports-based decision
If we keep "politics" out of sports all we say is that the international sports organisations can do whatever they like and get away with it
Q: But aren't there better ways to do this than a boycott
A: Like what
The point is to do something that is visible
Qatar buys goodwill by hosting sporting events ("sportswashing") and we can't let them continue this way
South Africa eventually became better after decades of boycotts
I don't think many today will advocate that the boycotts were wrong
Q: But it doesn't matter if my small country boycotts
A: Yes, everything matters
Now we should have started this movement earlier, but every country boycotting sends a huge message - just see how we're today taking about T-SHIRTS
And if one country boycotts it's easier for the next to follow
This will not be ignored
Q: But why now
What about Russia four years ago, Chinese Olympics
A: Just because we didn't do the right thing always in the past doesn't mean we shouldn't try to now
If we don't put the foot down it's only going to become worse
What if North Korea bribes its way into hosting the WC
Yes they absolutely should
Unfortunately FIFA is incredibly corrupt and rotten from top to bottom, impressively beating even the IOC in blatant corruption, and every promise of change has and will be broken unless governments start caring
Every part of me wants to play for the first time in 20 years, but I also understand that a boycot is probably for the best
Agreed
I'm very for a boycott against hosting the world cup in Qatar
We know many people have died during construction, it's been reported for a long time
I will honestly not watch even a second of it if (and I think it will) it's still held in Qatar
"Scheiß DFB"
Speaking as a guy from a non-member (but still Schengen) state, yes, ideally
However, priorities and timing are important
Currently international US-anyone relations are a dumpster fire anyway, and obviously Annoying Orange would just try to sabotage this for cheap PR points with his toadies
The next guy may or may not be less of a mentally deficient asshole, maybe there'd just be a better time in a year or so
[shudder] five
Even if Mr
Idiocracy is punted out in 2020 he's still had a massively destabilizing effect and it would probably be in *absolutely everyone's* best interests to not rock the boat for a bit before things have a chance to settle down
Taking a hard line stance on this might be premature even if it would *very* clearly be entirely justified
I'm every bit *as* shocked that I didn't *until* today
But to be fair, Annoying Orange v1 was a lot easier to avoid
It wasn't really stupid, I could have done it, but it wad funny
The prime minister had a press conferance about corona and how we shouldn't shake hands, then proceeded to ALMOST shake hands with another guy before realizing her mistake
It was funny
Similar here
The prime minister informed about the corona situation and that people shouldn't shake hands, then proceeded to shake hands with the other participants at the press conference
Ok but thats fucking funny
I guess that's the one I meant
Made basis for a great song tho
Ikr
It’s just what we needed
The unthinkable has happened here too
We're not allowed to go to our cabins in the mountains
We aren't allowed to drive to Sweden to buy cheap bacon and alcohol
The good old graduation tradition of wearing red overalls and drinking litres of beer
Rest in peace russetiden 2020
Live in the mountains, and we literally drowned in cabin owners this weekend
Most seems to have gone home by now thankfully, but still quite a few here
The only thing that could’ve been even more unthinkable would be if people weren’t allowed to go skiing or go for walks in the forest/mountain
The problem is when you get sick
The small mountain towns don't have the capacity to take care of hundreds of extra corona patients
you’re supposed to isolate yourself at home
the reason cabin trips are banned is because the poorer capacity in those municipalities can’t handle mass influx
Modern cabins are more like small (and sometimes not so small) vacation homes, are built in so-called cabin fields, and are very close to roads
This irks me, because whenever someone says they're going to their cabin, I immideately think making food over a fire, playing board games, reading Donald pockets, hiking/skiing
When in reality they're going to sit still, watch their flat screen tv, cook in an oven, and generally have all the luxuries of home, minus the immideate access to a night life
Yes, except that some of those people will still get sick, and the small mountain towns don't have enough healthcare workers
I live in one of these places
When most people think of cabins you think of a remote are usually without water and electricity
That’s not the case in popular winter places in Norway
There’s hundreds upon hundreds of cabins right by each other, close to the ski slopes etc
My county usually has approx 4500 habitants
At the height of people staying at their cabins, we probably easily both triple and quadruple those numbers
Needless to say, we’re not prepared for that amount of people in a pandemic like this
Not to mention, you would still have to go by a store to get groceries for however long you plan to stay
So although it sounds like a good plan in theory, it most definitely is not
And it will affect the local population, a lot of whom are elderly
I wish the healthcare workers in those regions good luck, and have fun
On Sunday I really felt like standing by the road and waving them goodbye
"GOOD RIDDANCE
And welcome back next time " The roads were basically empty on Monday
Not really
I think we will have to go to the Balkans if we are going to start talking about countries I sometimes forget about in Europe
Or places like Andorra and Lichtenstein
Not at all
They are like our little brother and best friend
Not really, guees it’s beacuse we are both Nordic countries
No, I see Iceland as "family" and I've been there several times
After looking a bit at mbl
is, it seems like you get more news from us than we get from you (it's funny how understandable written Icelandic is to us, even it seems not at first sight)
Its more like we hear news from Iceland if it's relevant for norway, like fishery
Other than that, we hear something from your music sometimes
But in everyday life, Iceland is mentioned now and then if we need a country to compare with norway
I dont know
Fun fact: Clothes at Hennes & Maurits (H&M) here has price tag in NOK and ISK
Trains in Norway are pretty much non existent
I've taken more train in Germany than Norway
That would be pretty much all the trains we have, sadly
I hope build a lot more
It's so sad
Depends on my mood and the question in question really
I didn't look through it now for example
I did
I have seen a shift in the type of ads that are being played here
It is a lot more of [this] type of ads where they focus a lot more on education and children than just "poor, starving children". Also, I just love the shot of the girl on the big pile of garbage :)
Quite common
I hardly ever browse the internet without adblock and never intend to, but I've seen quite a few ads about it on TV (and I don't watch much TV)
Africa is obviously a pretty complicated place, but it has a tendency to get oversimplified, like almost anyone is likely to do when it comes to a part of the world that's not their own
Since this stuff is blared at people a lot, it makes sense for it to feature in people's idea of the place
Absolutely
In Norway there is a foundation called “Redd Barna” (save the children) that is all about helping out poor children, usually Africans
There are lots of others as well, and on holidays the only commercials on TV are for foundations that help out others
So for example on December 25th you can get 2 or 3 ads for saving African children per commercial break
Yes, these days the sales pitch is to educate them out of poverty
Which ultimately will mean that people in the aid industrial complex will be out of jobs
So who knows what's *really* going on
Stool - it’s so similar to the Norwegian word for chair “stol” and the way they pronounce it makes it sound like they are trying to pronounce a foreign word
Idk but the word makes me uncomfortable
«You» for both singular and plural
I thought, no way that doesn’t confuse people
I’ve learned to read into the situation since then
Also, the word shirt sounded like the norwegian word for skirt, while the word skirt sounded like the norwegian word for shirt
The first time I heard someone called a puppy a "pupper" I kind of just stood there like "wh-what
I thought there’s no way that’s actually a word that is being used because it sounds stupid as hell
It also means boobs in norwegian, and telling them that was real fun
I saw a Mexican getting hated on(on Twitter by Americans)for naming her black dog Negro, which has no bad meaning in Spanish
But still they called her racist and all kinds of stuff
Edit: typos
The pronunciation of the word makes me uncomfortable, it’s completely irrational, but still makes me uncomfortable
Change it around
If the English word for feaces was chair, you would think saying human chair was a bit strange
In OP's language, chair only means chair
In the way that the pronunciation of a word(not the meaning) shouldn’t make you uncomfortable, and make you avoid saying it
Not that it’s a part of my every day vocabulary, but still
Isn't that what a butler is
Or is butler just for private households
I think we used to get them at home
We always had the new catalogue and it's frequently look through it and dream about how I'd set up my new home
I haven't gotten any since moving out though
Its 10 here and normally we would have had snow already
Only among some very old people who still hold grunges from the war
Maybe a few old people that remember the war, but generally there is no hostility towards Germans
Nowadays, no
Obviously some here will hate Germany for many reasons even to this day, that is common in every country I guess
But during WW2, there definitely was anti-German sentiment because of Nazi Germany taking over Norway
Not after ww2 but because you can't drive on our roads
You get me
I can't speak for the rest of the Nordics, but conflict aversion through polite language is definitely a thing in Norway
Being direct and unable to read social cues can be seen as rude
These comments are too much for me
My life is s lie
I need to lie down
Clothing brand Napapijri use the Norwegian flag as a logo, but it is an Italian brand
yeah I found out about this as an adult
Spar means Save, as in save money, so I always thought it was Norwegian
But then I learned spar is the name of the tree in Dutch lol
The other irony is that in Norwegian "Dass" is common (but not polite) word for the loo
So they are trying to sell "Toilet Ice Cream". Clever
I always thought it was danish for the same reason
SAME
I was shocked when I saw a Spar in Spain
Its a combination of the founders name and hometown **I**ngvard **K**amprad from **E**lmtaryd, **A**gunnaryd
Scandinavia is cold and ice cream is cold
I guess that's probably it
Denmark is the least cold, but internally in Scandinavia at least they're known for being the biggest food lovers
Wait what that is a tree in the logo
I feel so dumb i just thought it was a random symbol
It's working well enough that you will probably not find a single European wanting to change to a US type health care system
(At least I have never encountered anyone
) I shared this with someone else yesterday:
My son has been to the hospital 6 times since July last year
That includes 5 ambulances, 1 ambulance helicopter, 1 surgery, 1 MRI, 1 CT, 2 EEG, blood tests and other tests, 3 types of medicine, and follow up appointments at the hospital
Every time he stayed at the hospital I got to stay there with him, and we shared room (which had its own bathroom) with no one, and we had a kitchen down the hall where we could get food if we got hungry outside meals
Out of pocket cost for all of it: $0
And here no one pays more than $227 in out of pocket cost per person per year (for adult, as there are no out of pocket cost at all for children)
Anything above that the government will cover
That includes travel cost to a hospital further away (for instance if I have to go and see a specialist at a hospital in the capital)
So I'm not able to see any advantage at all having a US type private insurance compared to my government health care coverage
Universal healthcare would be a good thing for the US
Your health is one of the most important things in life and the US is rich enough to provide good care for everyone
But M4A seems like bad way of getting there
I would focus more on addressing the specific shortcommings of the current system than do such a drastic reform
Healthcare is a huge part of the economy and you just dont turn that upside down without causing any damage
And the US health care system is for the most part really good
Norway here, works out well
I'd say we pay about $25 for most regular doctor and hospital stuff (doctor visit, x-ray, medicines, etc) up to a yearly deductible of around $260
After that it's all free
For children, everything is always free
One exception is dental care, though
For some reason this seems to be the case for most European countries
We pay a lot for dental stuff
Still free for kids though
Waiting times aren't bad here
My doctor always has time to see me, although not usually the same day
If you go to the public ER you'll be put in a queue depending on how severe the nurses think your situation is, so if you're an anxious first time parent with a kid who cries constantly and won't sleep, you'll probably have to wait a while before the kid gives a massive fart and falls asleep in the waiting room
(Why yes, that is a personal experience
) I've never had any problems with waiting times though
Taxes are hard and I don't know too much about how it works
I pay 34% in income tax myself
Then there's obviously VAT and stuff too
I think 16
6% of all taxes in our country goes towards health care
38% (or so) of our BNP is taxes, but apparently those numbers are hard to compare with other countries depending on whether social service is taxed or not, etc
I dunno
I have no idea whether it would be a bad idea for the US - I don't really know how it works over there apart from some reddit anecdotes
But, you know, anecdotally, I have two kids and hang out at parenting subs
Americans always say that having kids is expensive, and how daycare is so expensive that it often makes sense for one parent to just forego a career to take care of the kid instead, etc
When I learned that giving birth costs money, though, that sounded even crazier
Numbers are numbers, and they're kinda artificial I guess
Yes, I pay a bunch in taxes, but so does everyone else, so our wages are fairly high I think
I mostly hear from tourists that everything is so expensive in Norway, but it's all relative I guess
Numbers aside, it feels good to not have to worry about health stuff
I was hit by a bus a few years ago, an ambulance drove me to the ER, I got checked out, then I could go home
I have asthma, that's all cool
Our kids were delivered for free and they get vaccines for free
My grandma needed a new hip last year, that got done
Contraceptives are free, and abortions are also free
And of course my employer doesn't have anything to do with my health insurance, and there's no "out of network" doctors, but we still have private doctors and hospitals if we want those for some reason (ie
if we're rich, I guess)
> It meant he wasn't eligible for NHS care
If he'd come home and paid his taxes, he'd now still have a house and a yacht, although maybe not as big as the ones he had and lost in the US
That's the thing
Americans living in the US (or Saudi Arabia) earn lots of money
But it's more risky as out of pocket cost can amount to astronomical amounts in the US
Living in Norway I don't have to worry about future health care cost, future care for my parents, future university cost for my children
Only larger expenses I might encounter are buying a new car and maybe fixing the roof on my house
That's it
The rest is covered
> and I have complete peace of mind about medical problems, accidents, or emergencies
That's the main thing
You pay taxes according to your level of income - and that's it
No need to give cost another thought
I can only start to imagine the stress-levels in parents in the US
One thing is not going to the doctor yourself because of cost, but not being able to afford taking your child there is a whole other level or anxiety
The funny thing is that he is less radical than the average Europan politician
Only Americans view him as "extreme".
> It costs the taxpayer more
Not necessarily
Every tax payer in the US is already helping pay for more than 30% of the population's health care (medicare, medicaid, prison health care, millitary health care, ER cost not paid by patients
On top of that they are paying for their own health care insurance and out of pocket cost - at excruciatingly high prices
So if the government get the prices down (as every government is already doing in Europe, I believe the over all cost per taxpayer will go down
And so it should be
Stupid people will always exist
No reason to deny them health care
In the US you still have to pay, even if another person was the stupid one
Lets say a drunk driver drives into your car and you are the only one to end up in hospital
The drunk driver pays nothing, but you pay thousands of dollars in out of pocket cost
The ambulance alone cost you $500-1000 over there
In Norway prices are negotiated on government level
The US can do the same
Do all workers in the US get health insurance though their job
If they don't I'm unsure what your point is
> It's "I'm fine, I'm not paying for everyone else".
The sad thing is that he is completely wrong
Becasue he helps pay for:
- prisoner's healthcare [(2,2 million citizens and non-citizens)]
- soldier's health care [(12,8 million citizens)]
- people receiving medicare [(44,3 million citizens)]
- people receiving medicaid [(48,6 million citizens)]
- People without insurance visiting an emergency room (costing the US government [$40 billion] a year)
So he helps pay for 108 million US citizen's health care
(ER costs not included)
That is **33%** of the US population
It's obviously a huge change
And the health industry will fight against it with all they got
So I'm not convinced that things will ever change, even if they need a change badly
Only times i don’t drink tap water is when I am out of the country
Never been anywhere that has as good tap water as Norway(except maybe Sweden), and it’s always a delight coming home from travel and you can grab yourself a glass of cold delicious water straight from the tap
Belgium and Spain had in particular bad water(Brussels, Ghent and Malaga and Barcelona)
France had mixed(Paris had horrific water, but Gaillac/Toulouse had decent water)
Denmark too has bad water
Sweden has about same quality as Norway
London water is 4/10 and Berlin water is 5/10
I added city locations as water quality in my experience has to do with how close you are to mountains, as mountain water is in my opinion the best water
Also where you find the most fresh water
That is what I drink 99% of the time
Either cold straight from the tap
Or by making coffee or tea with it
On **very** rare occasions I will drink other things
(Norway) Yes and we also bottle up tap water and sell to other countries like boss water, but when I bought it in Germany once it tasted like shit I don’t what had happened, if it had gotten a bad tast from tha plastic bottle or something ells
Only reason I'd buy bottled water would be at airports
There was this trend a few years ago where people would buy "Voss vann", so much so that they came out with a glass bottle with it that got stupidly popular (yes, people would buy bottled water on a glass bottle) all because of the name and look of the bottle I assume
The water isn’t even from the town Voss, and have nothing to do with the town at all as far as I know
Not to mention that it can be upwards of ten times as expensive as normal bottled water
Sparkling water just reminds me of the immeasureable dissapointment of buying it accidentally instead of regular water when on vacation and it's hot
I actually drink all my water from the toilet
I just stick a drinking straw into there and go to town
The fridge one is quite common, but considered fancy and extravagant imo
A brita pitcher I never saw before
I know what they are and have seen both, but they're not common here and I've never owned or used either
Fridges that dispense ice cubes are an upper middle class thing I think, and I guess they probably dispense water too, but I'm not sure what the need would be for that
Tap water is plenty cold enough
Many people do and many people don't. My fridge has a water dispenser and a ice maker
Hmmm
Really
I've heard it can smell quite a lot because of the sulphur though
Is that not the case
I’ve experienced it once in my life so far, so it’s fairly rare I’d say
But I assume it may vary a bit from place to place
Yeah the water is from Iveland in Agder
It’s not even close
Their whole thing was literally to market themselves as luxury water, even though it’s just as good as any other water in Norway
Nothing special about it what so ever
I teach high school in a high-income area
I regularly see students refilling "Voss" bottles at the sinks in the hallways
It's all about the fancy bottle
It doesnt really claim to be related to Voss tho
They call their source Voss, and lots of places share names
But yeah the water is honestly just regular water in a fancy bottle
That Could very much be the case
Our tap water sure is not best
Many places around both vestfold and viken have so much chlorine added
Barely drinkable
I see
Thanks
Quite often now - I study in English (spoken and written assignments) and use English a lot for work
The more I use both Norwegian and English throughout a day, the more confused my brain get haha
I tend to forget phrases in Norwegian, and simple, specific words in English
Way too often
I spent most of the teenage years and 20s playing games online, constantly talking in English, so there's that
And English is way more forgiving because it's so versatile ('versatile' is not a word I would remember in Norwegian, for example)
Hah, every day it feels like
It's probably often because I've read about a subject online, which usually is in english
Yes, this is it
My brain does not want to make it easy for me
Talking to or approaching strangers is only ok if you're hiking
Walk inside peoples house with your shoes on
Its clear to most that Scotland and Northern Ireland are not the same as England
But Wales on the other hand
I suspect lots of people outside UK are not aware that it's a separate country
I would even claim that most don't know they have a separate language
Unsure why this is thought
I met a Irish bachelor party and asked where in Scotland they were from
It escalated very quickly
Same thing here
That american "how you doing"-shit is provocative
My ex always used ketchup
Yeah
I think if I saw a Norwegian walk past the entrance room with shoes on I would deem them insane
There is no good reason for that
The personal space thing is the same in Norway
Yesterday I walked past my building's janitor (he has worked there for a couple of years) and I nodded as to say hi when I passed him
I could see the instant panic and confusion in his eyes
I will not be doing that again
I would have thought Polands time as a part of the eastern bloc is more touchy
Remember visiting Poland with my friend and his mother getting all patriotic when recalling the protests for independence
I had a lovely conversation about the war over a couple of beers at the bar in a swingersclub in Berlin
He couldn't have been that upset
He was still up for a threesome
Is «De/Dem» still used in DK or are you all «dus» like we’ve been in Norway the last 50 years
When I was a child everyone called you Holland
But I have no idea why
In some countries the official name for the Netherlands is Holland
Tbh Turkey seems so multicultural and all over the place I don't know what to believe about it
Like is it very religious or super non-religious, is it hot or cold, is it Arabic speaking or Kurdish or Turkish or whatever (I know there are many more languages in Turkey just the ones that came at the top of my head), is it Asian or European etc
would I be popular for mentioning ETA
> In the capital city of Bratislava – dont talk shit about the city
I was there once for a business trip
I actually enjoyed my stay
It was autumn and chilly and I was pregnant on top of that, so I feasted on all the good, hearty food there
Just don't act like an ass because they didn't greet you
Damn
Oh yeah let me stink up the bathroom
This is the most German thing I have ever read
In Norway people dont use houseshoes in their homes, maybe in their workplaces though
I think some things are different on the country side
I'm often greeted by both the janitor at my children's school, and the bus drivers
But I once tried to greet a bus driver in the city
I said "good morning" and he got that confused look you described
So now I keep my greeting to the countryside
(But I wouldn't dream of greeting the other people waiting for the bus
They are on their own)
as a norwegian i don’t really agree
I think people just refer to the eastern bloc countries, excluding east germany, as eastern europe
It’s almost as if their land touches their land
People don't do that
What
> just never ever mentioned anywhere in the media
Wales in general is not mentioned in the media
Except for "The Prince of Wales" now and again
Sometimes you rewrite a sentence a couple of times and then it turns into a cross between them
This was one of those times
It would be considered kind of rude not to
No one wants to see your hairy feet
I live in the city, but have spent enough time of my life on the countryside too, and you described it very well from my experience too
I do actually feel we could be *a bit* more open to such exchanges, just because it's nice
Don't get me wrong, I'm very Norwegian in my views of not talking to people, staying far away from most people etc
But some more hellos and thank yous would be nice
And we would be better at welcoming immigrants
What I do sometimes is instead of saying hello or good morning to the bus driver, I say thank you as I rush out the door
That way I express my appreciation, and none of us has to deal with the other, because I'm gone anyway
Well, this is not really "possible" now since I can't walk out at the front and that's the only time I feel brave enough to say thank you lol
It partly collective shyness in a way
It is sort of polite to leave each other alone and avoid creating awkward situations
If I don't say hello to you and bother you, you don't have to say hello to me
In every situation
I'll take a look, thanks
I mentioned Arabic because I had a teacher in sociolinguistics from Turkey and he spoke (among other languages) Arabic, so I assumed a certain amount of people in Turkey spoke Arabic (that and I double checked wiki and it said Arabic is spoken in Turkey :P)
I want to
Because I'll be able to drink a beer with my dinner haha
I did buy a few bottles of local/Slovakian wine to take home with me, to drink after the baby was born
I was very impressed with it
Is he a [pagan]
You guys don't have heated flooring and vacuum every week, or
I had a lot of microbrews the last time I was in Prague
I usually look for the smaller breweries everywhere I go
The wine I had was definitely premium
I know my husband wrote down the name somewhere, so I'll have to look for it again
What’s a fun statistic in which your country comes in last
I’ll start:
Norway has finished bottom of the table in the Eurovision Song Contest more times than any other contender in its history
That surprises me
I went to Slovakia once ans found your people very friendly
But then again, I’ve met the sweetest, kindest grandparents that dislike certain races
Poland
Wouldn’t have guessed it
Think I read somewhere that a lot of people travel to Poland for hunting
Guess I thought you’d have many hunting rifles
What annoys me is when british people (including official commentators and reporters for the broadcast) blame the UK’s performance on bloc voting
Like, even the most bloc voting regions like the balkans, baltics, central europe and scandinavia only have like four countries in it tops
You have Ireland and Australia voting for you so you’re actually above average when it comes to stuff like that
Countries like Albania and Armenia however can only really rely on their own diaspora, yet your last commentator I remember acted salty, saying stuff like "well of course, isn’t that typical" when Albania (again, not part of any bloc) got like 8 points from another balkan country
Is it because all your energy is diverted towards fellow balkan people, so you have none left for other ethnicities
Lmao
That’s really great
Keep going
They are only here to sell us fine and cheap weissbier
This thread turned out a bit more depressing that intended
I do appreciate though, how people are willing to admit their country isn’t perfect
No, we're quite amiable about it
I even let my friend bring his swedish girlfriend around when we celebrate the 17th of May
If OP had this happen in the middle east, the grandsons would retaliate
There is stupid shit like inherent grudge that keeps the wars going
One of my best friends are German
We joke a lot about nazis and ww1 and 2
It's always in good spirit and he can always find something to mock the Norwegians
Nah
To be fair I have never really talked to any Germans about the Nazi-occupation of Norway, but I would certainly not be awkward about it
It happened a long time ago
Otherwise I guess we haven't been the baddies that often
Even though we treated Samer quite poorly, and going back to the Viking Age we did a lot of pillaging
That is however thousand of years ago, and it is impossible to relate to
I do not really think people of York will be get all awkward if I mentioned the Vikings
Nah, still enjoying holidays in both Sweden and Denmark
No awkwardness
7 June should be the more awkward day to invite your Swedish friends for a party
If you think about it, 17 May would be celebration for swedes as it kinda the day they got Norway from Denmark
My great grandfather bombed Norwegian civilians with christmas presents
(Tobacco, coffee, chocolate, letters from the royal family and government)
Can be proud of that, yes
Not really
17th of May 1814 was the day that the Constitution was signed, stating that the Realm was a free, independent and undividable kingdom
It was an act of rebellion against the Treaty of Kiel, and ended with war with Sweden
The war was lost in August 1814 and resulted in the Convention of Moss which laid the basis for the personal union between Norway and Sweden and the November Constitution which stated that *" Kongeriget Norge er et frit, selvstændigt, udeleligt og uafhændeligt Rige, forenet med Sverrige under een Konge
"  -* basically that the Kingdom of Norway was a free, undividable and undisposable Realm, united with Sweden under one rule
Sweden didn't get Norway at all
The King of Sweden became King of Norway, but the two kingdoms were never incorporated into a single realm
Norway kept it's parliament, it's laws and it's government
The basis for the personal union was established in the Treaty of Kiel from January 1814, and affirmed 4th of November the same year
17th of May was not the date related to anything Swedish at all
17th of May celebrations was actually banned from 1815 to 1829, which formed much of the drive behind the way Norway celebrates its constitution day
That would be the [14th of January] or more appropriately the [14 of August]
The native Americans are coming
>And we quite like 17 May
Glad we can show you what a proper national celebration should be like
He was a pragmatic conqueror, with less regard for human life than most of us
Still not out of his way 'wants people tp die' like Hitler and such
Not seen as 'the baddie' in Norway either
Or, slightly baddie
Denmark-Norway was allied with him, and the British at the time are remembered a lot less favourably than Napoleon, what with the famine they caused
A lot of old people in Norway go to spain on holidays, so there's gotta be something which is good for them there
Weather is a factor, and stress is probably another and fysical fitness is probably the last
I got arthrithis and I can assure you, you're joint do work better in warmer climates + you get better sun/d vitamin that way
Wheather have an impact on your mood, winterdepression is a thing, tho more relevant the further north you go
Loneliness is also a thing, kills about as well as smoking or worse
I also think it's easier to be physically active when the weather is good, and that makes your health better i bet
~~Stress from office jobs is probably a bit worse in northern countries tho I don't know
I have read that life expectancy is more correlated to diet than quality of healthcare
Also the climate down there sure looks fine
It's called sunshine and a weaker currency up against Norwegian crowns
Speedingeurope - that's got to be one of the best website ideas ever

If the bar is being set at not being killed or chased, the bar is pretty low
-how can you tell that someone studies law
-he will tell you that himself
btw
I am a Master of Law, too
your recon your situation with your minority rights would be different if you studied, let's say submarine microbiology
word
you don't need to study law for that, tho
just read your rights with understanding
We have [russefeiring]
Norway: Hold my beer
In Norway we party for a month
We basically just say fuck the exam by partying for almost 3 weeks and barely showing up to school consciously
[This] comes to mind
It's supposed to be a serious scene, but for Norwegians it's just funny
His Norwegian isn't terrible (in that it's understandable), but he's clearly not a native speaker
But most importantly, even if the English education for someone who's in his 20s/30s in 1982 perhaps wasn't as good as it is today, you can be damn sure he could speak English if he was part of a scientific team in Antarctica, so it makes absolutely no sense having him speak Norwegian to someone he hasn't met before
In other words, you have a foreigner speaking Norwegian in a situation where a Norwegian would speak English
Every viking based show always does that generic Scandinavian accent like Vikings and the last kingdom
Annoying thing is for the most part they are actually really good, there’s just always a couple that are off
In Captian America: The First Avenger, when that one guy who was watching over the Tesseract tried to speak Norwegian
The sound quality was a little bad, but I could legit not even make out half of what he said, the first came off as mumbeling and the rest was something like 'Let them come'?
In one TV series a person was supposed to be Norwegian, but he spoke Swedish
So that was interesting
The actor was a German named Norbert Weisser - why they couldn't get a native speaker to play  the part or simply redub the few lines spoken by the character I don't know
Also, referring to the creature disguised as a dog as a "ting" is a very strange word choice
A native speaker would only use it for inanimate objects, "beist" or "udyr" seems more appropriate here
My mind immediately went for [this]
Short, but I have never forgotten it
I haven't seen that one before
That's hilarious
And the guy is just named "Trondheim". That's like having an American character named "Oklahoma City".
Oh boy that was terrible
I had to read the subtitles most of the time to understand it
Ouch
That was bad
I couldn't even make it through the whole thing
Disagree
Calling a dog a beast doesn’t really convey the point that it is some_thing_ way worse (some people call normal dogs beasts), and when an entity is unknown it is not really that uncommon to use object form in Norwegian
Haha, "skaahlløh". She's even correcting the guy who says it more correct than her
Just checked out the cut scenes, and the two women do indeed speak Norwegian
West and east dialects
Well, yes
Since they used Norwegian actors
Hivju from Game of Thrones being one of them
Haha I managed to push through as anything viking related gives me a massive bonor but for sure some of those accents sound straight up Turkish Australian Spanish, literally pick any country and add a Welsh singing syntax and you have American Scandinavian
Nah
That's an actual name
That definitely happens
You grow up one place, move to another place and have kids
My mother speaks an eastern Norwegian dialect, I speak a western one
'Spot the swede'- not that hard
They blond, blue and always trying to pull on a push door
Yes
That's the rare time we *do* say hello to strangers
Yes, hiking in the woods or mountains is the only time it's socially accepted (and expected) to randomly greet strangers
Imagine hiking alone far out in nowhere
Then you meet this one person
You say hi, but they don't even look at you while walking past you
I would be kind of scared for the rest of my hike
Came here to say this
I also say hi to someone I meet on the forest route here in my neighbourhood
Kind of odd passing each other on a very narrow path and pretend the other person is not there
So we say hi and continue on our merry way
Unless it's one of the super popular hikes (like Preikestolen) where you'd have to say "hi" constantly
> we kinda just say hello to everyone all the time
You say hi to STRANGERS
You scary Irish people
I guess you usually just drive up
Is it really so formal in austria
I would not approach doctors or old ladies differently than other people
Maybe norwegian is an informal language
Also came here to say this
Foreigners who move to Norway often feel like we never greet each other
But then they start hiking or skiing and suddenly they are greeted by everyone
There is usually someone writing about this in the newspaper about once a year under titles that are along the lines of: "I have lived here for 10 years, first now did I discover the Norwegians secret"
You scary person
Nope
Not unless you know them
Yeah, it's not like we are impolite, we just tend to choose our greeting locations more carefully
For you to be able to pretend you would still have to be aware of their whereabouts
I use this trick all the time
If I meet an acquaintance in the shop, which I know too well to just say hello to, but don't have time/energy to both greet and talk to, I pretend I dont see them
Most often they will do the same
(If they say hi and want to talk I obviously do the polite thing and have a small conversation with them)
Let us know how the visit turned out
I had no idea northern Italians were closet Scandinavians
;) How interesting
Would you say northern Italians are similar to Swiss people
> "Forbidden the entry to dogs and southerners"
If it's any consolation we did the same - it could be very difficult for someone from northern Norway to find someone who were willing to rent out an apartment to them in Oslo
They simply had a bad reputation in spite of most of them being very decent people
Now I somewhat regret only visiting Venice and Rome back when I went to Italy
I should have visited Milan as well
Oh well, next time
Edit: I meant Norway, not Italy
Fixed it now
> You should visit also the smallest town
Pescara, Assisi, Scilla, Verona, Siena, the northern Lakes and many others
In this way you will experience the real Italy
Thanks
It's always a good idea to talk to the locals to find the best spots
>  I'll be doing a week in Sweden next year as exchange student, but only because Norway was not available, I would totally have chosen Norway
So close
But I think you will have a great time i Sweden

Unisex dorms in the military
When I was in the military we used to be around quite a lot of germans and they just couldn't grasp the idea of unisex dorms, they had so many questions about it and honestly came across as a kinda pervert, they wondered if we would constantly screw each other just because we lived in the same dorm
Apparently in Germany they didn't even have male and female soldiers in the same buildings
I've also heard it's not a thing in the US
I'm not even sure if any countries have unisex dorms like we do
Here it's just natural, no questions asked
Calling everyone and anyone by their first name; the teacher, the doctor, the judge, the professor, the chief of police, the prime minister
> For instance, films and TV shows in Poland have neither subtitles nor dubbing, instead we have one guy reading the script out loud as the movie goes
Like a poor man's version of dubbing with one guy reading all the lines in a monotone voice, I haven't seen anything like that anywhere else abroad
On the day of Christmas Eve in Norway, the TV channel NRK airs a version of Three Wishes for Cinderella with that type of dubbing (though not monotone)
It's a highly cherished piece of film and people protest loudly whenever they even mention changing it to a "proper" dub
Watching the one-man dubbed Cinderella is one of my most beloved Christmas traditions
So I assume most homes have a bath tub
Here most apartments only have a shower
One Christmas movie is like that in Norway
> Weekly strikes
I thought they were daily
I've done winter camping and must say that I sleep much better when I sleep outside in the cold
I really need to find a way to market adult sized prams with those wool-lined sleeping bags inside
We cook pasta ALL THE WAY THROUGH
EVERY time
The King is still "His Majesty" though
We gotta draw the line somewhere
I wouldn't say it's a national pasttime, but you wouldn't really at an eye at it either
We prefer [these ones] (Keeps the kids dry)
I had no idea
So no alcohol at the tables outside an restaurant
Or are all tables always places inside
I actually bought the [black Pete game] for someone for Christmas
That is what I thought of when reading the OP
I would never see this movie without the one-man dubbing
Nice christmas morning tradition
You gotta go to Japan some time
Their queueuing makes Britain look like a bunch of pre-civilization anarchistic savages
They'll queue to get on an escalator
They'll form a perfect line for the subway long before the train arrives
Stores have markings on the floor so you can tell where the line should go if a thousand people show up to shop at once
They are queue connoisseurs
This was last year, so yeah should be pretty updated info
That was what they said about the base they were stationed in though, completley seperate buildings for males and females
I guess it's different from base to base, and also on what battalion/corps/company/troop you're in
Unisex showers, that's next level
We didn't even have that, but if you're out in the field you may have to swim completley naked with all your fellow soldiers
I remember there was some controversy when a story surfaced some years ago when a single girl had to swim naked with 30 guys(she was the only girl in the platoon) when their sergeants commanded them to do it
Constantly is probably a stretch
But of course it happened with 18-20 year olds alone and living together for the first time
I was in the army though which is pretty male dominated, our exact men-female ratio changed frequently but for the most part we would have 45-50 guys and 5-6 girls max where I was stationed
A few will always have boyfriends so your left with a ton of thirsty guys and just a few girls
I didn't do anything more than sleeping in the same bed but of course there were a few guys who got the full package and other favours
I wouldn't say living together was the main reason behind this though
Seeing as you usually live with multiple people your not really going to be able to fuck in your own room
And it was generally people who didn't live in the same room to begin with
The Air Force and especially Navy are much closer in men-female ratio from what I've heard
So I'd assume there as a lot more action going on there
True, although most people will say Kong Harald when talking *about* him
Outside the Nordic, yes
Yeah it does
Medical data shows that while British Pakistanis were responsible for only 3% of all births in Britain, they accounted for **30 percent** of British children born with a genetic illness
Guess why

You hug female friends and handshake male friends
Unless they're very good male friends then you gotta hug them too
Here in Norway I guess
I remember I got scolded by a female friend once for shaking her hand when I met her
Next time I met her I did better and my girlfriend scolded me

Can places just decide to essensially set their own drinking age
The punishment for loosing is to look like a chimney sweeper, with soot on their nose

Not a country, but we have the expression "helt Texas" (completely Texas), meaning "going off the hinges/devolve into chaos". Not necessarily in a bad way
If a party takes off, you can say "festen var helt Texas" (the party was completely Texas)
That probably means the clean-up is not going to be fun the next day
To take/do a Spanish one means to do something unordenly, f.ex
to take figurative shortcuts, or to tell a small lie
The Swedish method is to do something idiot-proof, f.ex
shutting down a machine by pulling the cord out
Few I can think of, some are a bit old,
ta en spansk en (do a spanish) is to take short cuts, do something cheeky and unorthodox
Svenskemetoden, the Swedish method, something idiot proof like unplugging a pc
Det var helt texas, it was like texas, to indicate something was hectic, crazy and over the top
Du store kineser, 'great Chinese
An expression of something surprising,
Klondike stemming, 'klondike vibes', used to express sudden financial growth / prosperity
We also use Greek to me directly translated,
Polsk riksdag, a polish government meeting / session, something loud, disorganised, shouting screaming etc
Remarkable how many are casually racist but there you go
Angry as a Turk - angry
Russian roulette - you know
To do a Spanish - to do something a little recklessly, not by the book
Norwegian arms - to reach over the dinner table to get something (considered bad manners)
French opening - an opening between the legs in feminine clothing
Swedish conditions - can refer to several things, all bad
Completely Texas - chaotic, lawless
"Sorry about my Swedish manners" = stretching your arm past a person at the table to reach something
The funniest one is "Du store kineser" which means kind of means "You big chinese(person)". Doesn't really translate well, though
Many also call it “svenskeknappen” (the Swedish button) when you use the on/off button on your machine to force it to shut down
How do you say the town in Russia thing in Danish
Doesn't it specifically refer to trapping someone *in* your dutch oven
As in, you fart under the doona, then throw it over your mate/partners head
Yeah
Haven’t really heard that expression since the 90’s luckily
That’s an oddly specific thing to have an expression for if no one is actually doing it
I consulted on o'mighty google, seems its the actual act of farting and trapping someone under
Edit: apparently Samsung disapproves of the word 'farting' and changed it to farming
I think it used to be more common
Me either, but I've been the victim of one or two
Australian girls are just as filthy as the boys, my friend in high school used to think it was hilarious (I'm half Australian, tried putting two badges on, but it didn't let me)
People were already afraid of immigrants "stealing" their jobs
Wonder how it will look when people actually want these jobs
At least the virus didn't come with migrants, that would have been a shit show
Man, that takes me back to when Romania joined the the EU
Suddenly the Polish were no longer thieves
It's the Roma
The Polish were just regular people like you and me all along
It's the Roma you gotta watch out for
Look I'm not going to comment on whether Roma are thieves or not, I really don't have any statistics on that
The point is that the fears about the old group of immigrants seems to disappear whenever there's a new wave
Before people were afraid of Polish immigrants they were afraid of the Pakistani
When I was in university I lived in an international student housing
I only encountered about 4 other Norwegians there that year
One day I was doing laundry in the basement and there were two guys talking to eachother
I could not figure out what language they spoke, it just got weirder and weirder the more I listened
Slowly I realized it was norwegian, so I walked over and asked where they were from
Turns out they spoke my dialect, from my own area
I expected a foreign language, and my brain tried its best to give it to me
(Happens all the time when I listen to music and I don't expect it to be a Nordic language
In the second movie «the thing». I wasn’t prepared for Norwegian, and something about his accent made me not understand anything he was saying
It was only after turning on subtitles I could understand it
Norwegian here
Some dialects are legitimately just hard to comprehend
One of my exes was American and when she came to visit the second time she had asked me how to say "It's good to be home again" in Norwegian so she could greet my parents
Even though she said it perfectly, neither my mom or dad understood what she was trying to say because their brains were wired to expect English from her, so they thought she was saying something they didnt understand in English
This subreddit is basically Norway in a nutshell
For every valley or fjord there is a different dialect
Poor foreigners that try to learn Norwegian have to decide if they want to learn bokmål or nynorsk - those are the official written languages
What nobody tells them is that no-one speaks like that, they are written languages and there is ten thousand dialects with different words and pronounciation in spoken Norwegian, so there are plenty of local dialects even natives don't understand
In the 80ies, Norway used to have a Saturday night tv show consisting of some random person saying a few sentences and linguistic experts pinpointing what village they were from
And they could narrow it down to villages with a population of a few hundreds
This happens to me as well
If I don't recognize the language, it's like my brain doesn't know what dictionary to use and it all sounds like familiar gibberish
Then as soon as I twig that they're actually speaking Norwegian (or English), suddenly I understand everything
Latest offender: Umbrella Academy on Netflix
Lol, I love how the native text in the video calls it "the shire"
I had a hard time with dialects in Innlandet when I moved here, but it's getting better
But there seems to be families/communities/areas all over the "fjøl" that mumbles more than others
I've encountered some in the north and some in the middle
I still don't understand my grandfather-in-law even after 7 years
I sometimes need my own stepfather to translate to different vocabulary because he is from a tiny place outside of the city (but same county)
Some dialects are difficult to understand and will use completely unintelligible words and very different pronunciations, but talk to enough people/watch enough Norwegian tv and you will eventually gain somewhat of an understanding of most dialects
Its the rural ones that tend to be most difficult, because of the isolation

Came here to say this
Without subtitles I would have had no idea what they were trying to say
She wasn’t, but the “Swedes” were
«I Kassa på Rema», the cashier in one of the large supermarket chains
Usually you hear «kassa på Kiwi/Rema/etc
Kiwi and Rema are cheap supermarket chains, so basically it means if you don’t study you will en up working behind the till at one of these places
McDonald's and grocery store are the ones I have heard the most
They say that if you don't study well, you will end up working at McDonalds
You will become a naver, someone who lives of the state's "trust fund", the tax money

My Sister did an exchange year in US, St Louis,  was asked if we ride polar bears
Because of the golden compass
My mum was on holiday in Florida and they asked her if the troll documentary was real (trollhunter movie)
Gotta love em
That our islands have more than 4 houses each, so yes - they do have shops, banks, schools, and everything else you will find in the average town
Which greatly surprised an elderly lady visiting from South Africa
She also asked us about every speck of snow on mountain tops we saw if it was a glacier
In the end we just said yes to stop her asking
That everyone is rich
I had several people thinking everybody was rich in Norway
The country itself has a lot of money, the people are average
We dont have polar bears walking around in our streets
Americans think Norway is a socialist country
Is not, never has been
It is capitalism with a large welfare state
"The midnight sun" is the same sun you see in the sky where you live
You never hear about the mid day moon, but if there is midnight sun in the summer, that place will have no sun in the winter
For months
Don't plan on hiking or camping in the off season unless you are drilled in winter survival in darkness
If we had vikings living in reservations
And no, you cant go trollhunting, we do not offer polarbear rides to tourists, no there isnt a reindeer rental and islands are connected to the mainland, by boat, bridge or tunnel, and some of us dont work in the fish sector
Had to explain to a turist that yes, this city is made of 11 islands, no, you dont need to rent a boat to travel, you can indeed get places on foot, if you look down you will se a bridge
That you are standing on
That connects
Two islands
Without the need of a fucking boat
As is the funcion of a bridge

You've got to take into consideration that stuff is expensive
You have caribou
No, they are not fatty at all, just like any animal with hooves
More tasty than beef, less gamey flavour than moose
Fat content probably somewhere between beef and the much leaner moose
It is the fur that keeps them warm
Every hair is hollow with air inside, which make them extremely insulating
I'm all for it
Some people treat this as a sort of moral dilemma, but I just don't see it
We make wearing seatbelts mandatory, we forbid speeding and drunk driving - why shouldn't we legislate against endangering yourself and others with infectious diseases
When it comes to children (who are usually the recipients of vaccinations), the question just becomes ridiculous
To allow people to risk their children's health because of superstition is worse than allowing them to beat them
I'm asthmatic too but I have never considered getting the flu vaccine
Have you ever had any side effects from it
Bruce Willis has a line in Pulp Fiction that goes "It's not a motorcycle, it's a chopper, baby
" In the Norwegian cinematic version, it was texted (in Norwegian)  as "It's not a motorcycle, it's a helicopter, baby
Keep in mind, he is sitting on said chopper while delivering the line, so you'd think it would have been pretty easy to see that something wasn't quite right
"Make up sex" became sminkesex, sminke meaning the Norwegian word for makeup
That's the one I can think of, off the top of my head, but there are plenty more
In my English textbook from middle school it mentioned that a ski jumping commentator translated «Han tok av med en enorm fart» as
he took of with a tremendous fart
While a very funny story, is it just me or is it kind of weird for a translator to have automatic emails in just one of the languages he translates to/from
In Norway there's a comedy movie called "Detektiv Downs" which is about a detective with down syndrome
He used to be known as Lynvingen in Norwegian (meaning The Lightning Wing)
Does that mean you can finally change your national anthem to the one you were destined to have
On topic, no, I didnt know
How good of news is this
Is the russian language really discriminated against
In Astana and Almaty I never heard people speak Kazakh
All the bars played russian music, every restaurant menu was in russian
I know this does not show the whole picture, but it hardly seems like a language which is discriminated
28-30 degrees celsius now for the past couple weeks
I'm nearly dying
It's nearly 30°C. It was too hot so I'm currently running away to my family's cabin where it's about 22°C.
It's to hot
We have between 20-26 Celsius both day and night
In the sun it is 30 Celsius
It is extremely hot
The heat record in my city is 32,7 Celsius
It's a bit hot when we had almost 0 Celsius and snow in the middle of May
It is insanely hot, but as we say "we can't complain either". I'm actually done with it, just going swimming and playing volleyball
Thankfully, I'm from Northern Norway, so I don't think it's gotten any hotter than 20-something degrees over here
In fact, it's usually a little too cold most days
I haven't done anything but sweat and get sunburnt for the past weeks
No i'm dying in heat, in norway( Oslo) i'm lying down on the sofa not daring to move because then i'll melt and die
You have to go back to like 1970 to find a warmer summer ;-; it's so high you can't see the highest on the scale on my Phone because of how warm it is
I'm probably going to steinbruvann when it hits the warmest
I envy you
I miss our normal weather
Faen, de høres så jævlig finn ut akkurat nå!
Because it's cheaper
Yeah
It's insane
I'm staying inside for the most part, with two fans in my room
Seems to work pretty well until I actually have to walk outside, at that point I'm just praying I don't collapse on the street
Me too ;w;
I hope so
I just gotta apply sunscreen as often as I can and be in the shadows as much as possible
Yeah, I think it'll be fine too
It's just kinda frustrating rn, since I can't really do much about the weather
But thanks for the concern
Then of course the Danes said the same about Norway 200 years ago
We could never prosper without the colonial masters, but here we are
That’s awesome, I understood that sentence 100%! Is Faraoese a west Scandinavian language
No they did not
And Norway was never a Danish colony
It's quite fascinating to listen to
Denmark definitely suppressed Norway and it was treated as a colony
You can check any Norwegian history book and see that
Of course, Danish books will paint a nicer picture, but that is hardly a trustworthy witness
Ive never seen this in any history book
> Which are obviously a far more impartial source than the Danish books
Yes, of course it is more impartial then a Danish book in this respect
If you want to learn about how one country suppress another then you cannot only learn from the suppressors: If you want to learn about the British Empires and it's effects on its colonies, you should not only trust British writers
If you want to learn about the effect of slavery in the US; do not read books only written by white people
If you want to learn how Denmark suppressed Norway, do not read only Danish books
> Funnily, Wikipedia concurs with the Danes on this subject
Wikipedia: The ultimate truth
>Wikipedia concurs with the Danes on this subject, which is unsurprising, since the notion that Norway was a colony is absurd
Norway was not called a colony, but was treated as one in ma y respects
You should check a Norwegian source, like the most respected [Encyclopedia] This explains how Norway was subdued by Denmark with the use of military force
Not really a sign of equality is is
\>  Norway has never been a colony, and to claim as much is rank revisionism
Again, read something that does not come from the suppressors
I have talked to so many Danes who have absolutely no clue how Denmark behaved against Norway
There's a saying in Norway that Norwegians are born with skis on their feet, what are people from your country born with
Great question
Looking forward to read through the comments
I was born in Norway, but all I had on my feet were toes
Hahaha I love this
Makes me think I should be danish, I much prefer beer over skiing

I didn’t know people identified as Macedonian, Epirotes etc more than Greek to this day
Many people including me think Oslo (our capital) is ugly
Personally, I'd add bø i Telemark too
Naming it after [this guy] might not have been a great idea
The ugliest city in Norway has to be Sarpsborg
It's got some nice neighborhoods here and there, but most of it looks worn down and the city centre is a gigantic biorefinery
Drammen gets picked on for being "ugly", too, mostly because it has a giant motorway bridge cutting through it, and it doesn't have the beautiful surroundings Norway's other "ugly" towns do to compensate
But there are parts of the town that are rather nice
Id give it to sauda instead tbh
I would say Otta is also famously ugly (very similiar name too funnily enough)
I have family in Västerås and I visited the place quite often
The old ABB/ASEA building is really beautiful
The worst thing I found with the city is just the amount of sprawl and the surprisingly large number of huge American-style malls that are on the outside of it
Some have been demolished but the remaining parts are protected
Bedre med en dram i timen enn en time i drammen
Drammen has become a really beautiful city
They have worked a lot on making the city beautiful, and now there are lovely walking paths and bathing areas by the river, lots of art around the town, cozy cafés and restaurants everywhere
And the sorroundings ARE beautiful
I think a popular Norwegian comedian ruined the city's reputation back in the 80s. For me, it now is among the top 10s.
Yeah Drammen and Oslo are uglier
Old Town Fredrikstad is really beautiful
Thankfully it's separated from the rest of the town by moats and a river

>Kongeriket Noreg er eit fritt, sjølvstendig, udeleleg og uavhendeleg rike

The kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable realm
The form of government is limited and hereditary monarchy
Feel free to correct my translation
Norway :
Article 1
"The Kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable realm
Its form of government is a limited and hereditary monarchy
Not as good as Netherlands, I must say
ARTICLE 1
Kongeriget Norge er et frit, selvstændigt, udeleligt og uafhændeligt Rige, forenet med Sverige under een Konge
Dets Regjeringsform er indskrænket og arvelig monarkisk
(Its written in danish beacuse Norway had just gotten out of a union with Denmark)
The direct translation is: The Kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and independent kingdom united with Sweden under one King
Its form of government is restricted and hereditary monarchy
It’s a little bit outdated considering we are not in an union with Sweden anymore
Not bad for a dog
The whole constitution has an official translation here:
Article 1:
> The Kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable realm
Its form of government is a limited and hereditary monarchy
Our constitution was very modern 200+ years ago, but reading it today (even after recent changes) really shows that time’s gone
The constitution predates parliamentarism in Norway by 70 years
Well, you know, I've been practicing, by reading books
I gotta say, I'm pretty happy about only getting one word wrong
That really can’t be a government website
You were so close it was kind of scary

I still can't listen to AC/DC without being reminded of them
While drifting off, my friend suddenly grabbed my shoulder and said that we were leaving, because a dude in a leather trenchcoat and a cowboy hat with a riding whip broke out a coffee grinder and ground some white substance into his cigarette
We spent the rest of the night at McDonalds

It's just that I'm willing to endure all kinds of pain rather than throwing up

The extreme north
Basically no trees, no sun during the winter, *huge* distances to everything, lost a large share of its historic building stock during ww2 and some smaller towns are suffering from depopulation
We were a part of Sweden for almost a century until 1905
The Norwegian civil war
Not many Norwegian knows of it either, but basically between 1130 and 1240 there was constant civil wars over who had rights to the throne, bastards of earlier kings popped up like crazy at the start and everything where going wild, slowly the first generations had children and were killed, they fought it out and were killed and the third generation the factions had united into two
both sides thought they had the power to win, the southern with support of the Danes attacked the north but were destroyed in a battle outside of the northern capital, after this the southern lords were persuaded to not unite under a new king and the kingdom was united, but there were still some smaller rebellions for ten years
The two late factions were the Baglers who were supported by the pope and the Danes residing in the south, the other side, which I’m named after were the Birkebeiners
In English literally birch legged, the name came as some of them were so poor that they couldn’t afford proper footwear, the power base of them were the trøndelag region
The decisive king for the Birkebeiners were saved over the mountains by Torstein Skevla and Skjervald Skrukka, after he was born, there’s a movie by it but it isn’t super good just a okay domestic movie
He was born after the king had died to a girl who had slept with him once, bastard as always

In Norway when asking for water in a restaurant, tap water is the standard and you have to specify if you want bottled
It seems to have spread over here as well, though I thought this was an international thing
Oh my gosh seriously
Yep, we either call candy "snop" or "godteri (godt for short)". It may be regional, I mosrly use "snop".
Snopp means dick in norwegian too
I mean, "snopp" and "snop" are quite different when you say it out loud
Yeah, snopp is a tiny childrens dick
Snop is candy
And after writing this I feel kind of filthy
Kneppetelt og bollemus :D
We have the unique words Æ, Å and Ø. I don’t think any other country have them in their alphabet
If what I was told is true, norwegian has a word no other language has: “oppholdsvær”. It means clear weather basically
Not too unique

Why do you have a designated word for soap salesman
I have heard that in finnish, you can use as many vowels as you want to describe a word
For instance, if someone was shouting, it’s grammatically correct to write “heeeeeeey”. Is that true
Sounds like Norwegian koselig as well
Also , how is it used when talking about religion or science for example
Is it used the same all over the country
u/seco-nunesap
Wait
The Danish dialects are called _trøndersk_, too
passe :)
Oh yeah I forgot that
Winter time definitely
Because that will keep mid-day and mid-night at 12 and thus our time will be in step with nature
Summer time
But I think switching works well
It's just one hour so nothing compared to adjusting after a long flight
We should keep winter time
It's the right time after all, when the sun is in the middle of the sky at noon
As someone who lives at the 63 parallel
Definitely want to keep wintertime
It would be preferable that the 4 hours of "daylight" I get during the winter is while I'm awake
Didn't read the full article, but having the capital bisected by a timezone line is madness
Did they turn it back
I'd love to have that much light in december
Wow, what a tragicomic story
Reminds me of the day Sweden switched from left-hand side to right-hand side driving on the road
There are some legendary pictures on the internet
What is weird is going to another country with a different latitude
Going from very long days with a lot of light in the summer to a place with pitch black nights further south
It's basically useless around here
You're going to get dark winters and bright summers any way
That's nice
We send a Christmas tree to London every year as a thanks for what they did to help us during WW2
I think we send a couple more to other regional cities in the UK too
At least we did in the past
That story gives me chills
Really amazing
Kind of odd knowing the amount of pizza and pasta you eat
But it is probably down to 100% HOMEMADE pizza and pasta I guess
I remember watching a documentary about a small village in Italy where everyone lives really long, and getting to look inside the pantry of different families
A lot of meat and sausages hanging from the ceiling, jars of canned vegetables, and whatever else to last them through the winter
Very fascinating that people still live like that in Europe
(Here it hasn't been like that since the 50's - 60s..)
Isn't that the case in all of northern Europe though
The only real street dogs I ever saw was on Madeira
> Prison escape is not punishable by law in Germany
Same here
> Almost one-third of Germany is powered by renewable energy
98% here
But I don't mean to gloat
(Honestly)
Well done Germany for increasing your renewable energy production
(And I would like to know more about German prison system
Maybe there is a documentary
Wow, I had no idea
Sadly it didn't spread until much later
Incredible that she survived
> We take coffee brakes with friends for at least 3 hours
During office hours
Or after work
That is something to be really proud of
I wish we could say the same
When was it
(health care system launch
How does the dead person agree to marriage
Engagement before they pass way
> Now I want to get in jail in Germany, then try if I can escape from it
Careful with that, Germany might have an agreement with Turkey to extradite prisoners for them to serve their sentence in Turkey instead
That's neat
I wasn't aware of that
Yeah you can't really compare Italian and American pizza
The start of Norwegian public healthcare system can be traced back to the 1500's. But what is consider the year when the modern version of it started I do not know
> 1956
Then I learned something new today
> pretty cool to see how we all in unison realised that healthcare was a good idea and we should have it
Something to be proud of I think
Anything in the Balkans or possibly Post Soviet Russia/Ukraine
Paris or Berlin
Large, iconic cities which are both beautiful and had some grit
Malta
Rolling in a Trabi would be so sick
*shitty 1 litre diesel revving*
«Oi, mate
That geeza just nicked me bloody Corsa
*mission starts*
>Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense
a bit different in Czechia though
edit:
seems like finland has the most registered pr 100 people actually
Okay this concept is so awesome
Norway is second so you're probably right
Trolltunga (Troll's tounge) and Preikestolen (Pulpit rock)
They are so overcrowded, while there are so many other beautiful places in the norwegian nature that are empty of tourists
I don't know if this is considered "tourist traps" as it is free to go there
It's definitely possible to travel there on a budget however
I mean, McDonalds at least wont empty your wallet for eating there and charge like 10€ or whatever for a bottle of sparkling water
That sounds cheap
Nordkapp is one, it used to cost 285 kr (ca
30€) to enter the plateau
And the money went to some hotel chain
Which infuriated the locals so much that in the 2019 they voted for SV solely because they promised to kick that hotel chain out, and make entrance free
So I guess the revolution was able to remove one tourist trap
Now they should do the entire country and especially Aker Brygge
That might explain last time i took a taxi in Turkey
I took a cab from Alanya to Gazipasa airport and i remember feeling like the drive took much longer than last time
When we finally arrived, the driver asked if i could pay 150 euros instead of 150 Lira lol
Some i stayed with some French people in southern France, and they said they didn’t really like Paris
They felt unsafe, and apart from the architecture, it didn’t really feel French
All the people trying to sell you something on every corner, and few legit French dining opportunities
When I visited Paris, I loved the architecture and the art in louvre, but the rest of the city is like any other big city
Huge crowds and traffic everywhere, rare to find a quiet area
France has so much more to give than only Paris
No surprise that a lot of the people in that spot are Norwegians
> Aker Brygge
that's the best promenade in oslo tho, its even free to be there
The dining thing, was what the southern France family told me, I don’t know enough to know if I was eating legit French food or not(even though I enjoyed what I ate
I have been in France twice, once in Paris for a week
And southern France for a month
And I loved the area I was in southern France
Toulouse,  Albi, and surrounding area
I love (!) my personal space, I enjoy skiing in winter, I wouldn't dream of pretending I'm better than anyone else, I trust the police and government, and I eat brown cheese
So yup
When on a bus, I genuinly get annoyed when a stranger sits right next to me, but I don’t feel confident enough to tell him about it
I'm a bad Norwegian in some ways
I am not great at skiing and I don't particularly like fish
I can't stand ski, I dont know how to ski either :') I have dark blonde hair and green eyes, im not very tall
I dont like sea food
Im bad at swimming and dont like to bathe in the sea or lakes
I can't stand brown cheese and i hate skiing
I don't mind if a stranger talks to me unless I'm in a hurry
We complain about them all the time, but for the most part we do trust them
They were after all elected by the people
Few foreigners like it, but most Norwegians love it
They sell it in Australia
The biggest surprise to people is usually that it's sweet, not salty
Try it on some fresh (Scandinavian) waffles, it's amazing
I can only think of one short clip in x-files where a native Norwegian spoke Swedish
Other than that it's fine
That episode in "ledgends of tomorrow" where they went to Norway to stop someone from bying nuclear weaponds
I would like to say that we have never had an atomic bomb on norwegian soil, though that reasently changed when the norwegian gouverment forced my city to take in som american submarines with nuclear bombs
But still, we don't have any nuclear bombs, and if we had, we sure as hell woulden't sell them in a godamn auction in a wearhouse of what seems to be western norway
If we wanted to get wrid of them we would probobly dismantle them
I absolutely love the comedic portrayals of Germans by Americans such as the Germans in Community or the ones in Beer Fest
Some of the best laughs I had from comedy
Recently I watched the first season of 24
Even me as a non-Serb crinched upon hearing the fake accents by the American actors
The most hilarious was when a character (American actor) was speaking with a flawless American accent, and then upon being revealed as a Serbian terrorist, he suddenly switched to having a fake thick Serbian accent
Nikola is a name in Serbia isn't it
Could be a shortening of that
Do not know about popularity but the old "nrk, dr1, ylesat and svt" movie franchise has produced some cringeworthy movies with stereotypes about all four
My impression is that Norwegians are often portrayed as tall, wild, rough and beardy in movies, often «wilderness-people». Can’t think of any particular movies, though
Then you have that Mission Impossible scene, where Tom Cruise climbs the Norwegian mountain Prekestolen, and in the movie it’s in India
>clip in x-files where a native Norwegian spoke Swedish
If you're talking about the episode [DØD KALM] (lol), I wouldn't exactly call it Swedish, haha
It's pretty hilarious - they go to "Tildeskan" in Lofoten, and meet a guy called "Henry Trondheim" in a bar full of fishermen, all clad in [lusekofter] and [islenders] with walls draped in Norwegian flags
Very Norwegian indeed
She was actually swedish and they didn't even try to mimick the current royal family there
I thought it was fine
Our king is Danish second generation immigrant
So yeas, really closley related
Woulden't make sence at all
And his daughter renouced her royalty years ago
She is still a prinsess, but they kind of figured out some deal there were she is part of the family but got wrid of some title I think
As this is based on a comic book where exaggerations aren't uncommon, I wanted to let this one slide
Also, this scene is hilarious
> An example could be at the end of "The Danish Girl" they used a shot of a fjord in Norway for Vejle fjord
They did WHAT
> tall, wild, rough and beardy in movies
Well
some of us do [look like this
> where Tom Cruise climbs the Norwegian mountain Prekestolen, and in the movie it’s in India
That is cringeworthy for India, not Norway
But I guess Norway is usually portrayed in a good light (although sometimes wild and hairy), hence why we don't really find it cringe worthy
Why wouldn't that make sense
Our two previous kings both married their cousins
Do you know if someone in Bosnia would
There's a professional cs go player from there who uses niko as his  in game name
It woulden't make sence that a Norwegian prinscess would have to marry in to the danish royal family considering how closly related they are to denmark
Haakon and Maud were first cousins
Olav and Märtha were first cousins
And any potential Danish-Norwegian marriage wouldn't even be between first cousins
If you're talking about the current parent generation, it would be second cousins, and if you're talking about their children, it would be third cousins
In royal circles, that's hardly even being related
So what the hell are you talking about
I didn't know it but It's actually in some European countries
I am talking about todays standard, obviusly I know that, but also thinking about royal circles, it is really not that long ago since they were part of the danish Royal family
Olav was Danish born, so thinking in that sence it would make more sence of them marrying in to another royal family then the Danish one
Also, fun fact, Norway most likley chose that family because of Maud
It would give us alot of power having a British princess in our royal family
But as well as that
It woulden't make sence of us being poor either
We were poor before the oil, but even then we did pretty well because of our systems
But I digress
It would make more sence for Norway to marry into another european royal family if it was purley for diplomatic reason
Ok, first off, it's "sense", not "sence". Secondly, Norway wasn't poor before oil
We were in the top half in Europe in terms of GDP per capita throughout the 20th and 19th century
Okey, but we were kinda poor in the early 1900's, and yeah, we had good systems that made it better
You know, there is a reason we have the term "fetebarn", and that is because some people were to poor to actually feed their children, so they sent them to relatives to fatten them up
And, I have only gotten a 5 hours of sleep tonight, because of where I live, there is barly any light outside, and there wasen't any when I wrote that comment, and my english wrigting is shit nowadays, especially when I am tiered
And I don't feel like checking up on the spelling on every word, when you understand my point perfectly fine
So I would appreciate if you focused on my point rather then my grammar
And apologise for being to tiered to elaborate more
And you still get my point, it still would make more sense for a Norwegian royal to marry in to another european royal family then the danish one, if it was purley out of diplomatic reasons
Hmmm, must be sweden
Don’t know why everyone believes in it when it’s clearly east Norway
Took a taxi in the north of Norway a few years back
The driver explained how there was no climate change/global warming
This is a bit hard to believe if you've live in the north of Norway since the evidence is fairly obvious
His theory is that the government  secretly moved the arctic circle further north
This has resulted in winter seeming warmer, but we're actually just further south than we used to be
In relation to the arctic circle, everything is as it should be
El Psy Congroo
Hopefully he was just bored and made shit up to tell the customers for a laugh
Depends
Sometimes the first and sometimes the latter, but mostly the first
The latter one is too much of a chore to write
Definetly α. Nobody I know writes a. We didn't learn it in school and nobody does
I write not a(couldn’t find the other)
I write cursive though
I write it like «a», but it’s something I chose to do, I never learned to write it like that in school
Likewise in Norway
[Like this] though I like to leave the 'e' part a bit more open (wider) to make it more distinct from 'a'.
[Like this]
Haven't seen an æ like that before, but it was still understandable
Same for Norway
I made the same decision in junior high, and have the same problem with my r's and v's. Some people also first believe that my a's are mirrored s'es or sloppy z's, as I draw a with a single stroke
In Norway, we want Iceland and Greenland back from you Danes
Also Jämtland, Härjedalen, and Bohuslän from Sweden
&#x200B;
And more for the joke: Conquer Sweden for 100 years and Denmark for 400 years, just at payback
Even more jokingly, reconquer our parts of the UK
We joke about retaking Jemtland and Herjedalen, maybe we should team up against Sweden ;) Just a joke, of course
Unless you want to do it
Haha, no, I'm kidding
Unless
Those damn swedes
We want jemtland, herjedalen and båhuslen
We sometimes joke about taking back Jamtland from Sweden
Just don't joke about it with the Germans, they're very literal minded
Wait until you hear we ruled Denmark in the 1040s
Who said anything about *buying* it
But,  but our generational talents
it's so annoying when countries are afraid of actual war over a music contest
it’s not our fault we’re so cool and good at music B)
Big news in Norway
Fervent anti vaccination beliefs on both ends of the political spectrum
America is somehow very proud of having a separated state and church, yet the President is sworn in on a bible, your country motto is “in God we trust” and just the prevalence of God/Christianity
Also, does the general American actually believe it’s the greatest/best country on earth
*I’ve just thought of another one that I don’t think I’ve seen mentioned here: all your drug adds on TV
Like what the actual fuck
Your whole society is built around the car, so why not make the driver's education better
Here, it's a 30 hour lesson system with an intro course, practical test, theory test, lessons on driving in the dark, driving on slippery conditions, and you're also expected to practice driving a lot with your parents or other adults
My impression is that you can basically pick up your license for a fee and a small practical test in the US
Is this correct
This is not just cultural but a little linguistically related too
I'm not comfortable with the "race" concept, and I find it both confusing and very
incorrect in my eyes
I know there's black, white, Asian (but is it all Asians, or just East and South East Asians
) and then I think there is Hispanic and Latino/a but I don't know what they mean
And then there's just "mixed".
It's also just because in my native lang, using the word "race" for people makes you sound like an old school nazi
The only time you use race for something is for dogs and cats and such, not people
So yeah, it doesn't sit right with me, but I understand identifying your race in North America (and some other places, like Singapore or South Africa, where they also still use the term "coloured" I think
) is very important to people so I only criticise it with other non-Americans mostly
But to be honest it all sounds like a recipe for racism to me :P (not saying Europe's concept of ethnicity and nationality is racism proof by any means
- That you only vote very wealthy people into congress
(Edit: Sorry, forgot about the "besides politics"-part)
- That no one marches the streets demanding all citizens having access to affordable health care
- That parents in some states are allowed to hinder their children getting basic education
- How Americans are able to always being able to small-talk with anyone, anywhere
- That in some states keeping tigers as pets is legal
(Yes, I just watched Tiger King)
How much they like to argue about everything on the internet
I even had a argument with a pizza delivery guy on vacation in Florida
He went from asking where i was from to asking me what i thought about Norway being socialist
I just wanted a Pizza, dammit lol
Another confusing thing is that American fast food and soda tend to taste better outside of the US
I think it has something with using ingredients to make production cheaper that isn't legal many other places
Here in Norway for example the McDonalds beef, potatoes and chicken is domestic
How they have the most broken healthcare system of any civilised country, and so many want to keep it
You have to be 16 to drive, 18 to have sex and JOIN THE ARMY, and 21 to have a beer
The first thing probably comes from the fact that america was colonized, so unless you're native, you have a heritage outside of america
I'm also annoyed by this
However, I did also realise those people are the ones that are the most interested in talking to you about "our" culture, they get thrilled if you teach them a word or two etc
Like, not too long ago I met a Canadian dude who said his family was of Norwegian heritage or something (because I said I was from Norway) and it meant his great grandparents I think were native norwegians and came to Canada
He didn't know the language at all, but he *did* have a very Norwegian name
And my first reaction was kind of like "oh great, you're *that* kind of person (internally
I would *never* make fun of somebody being excited about their little drop of blood from overseas), but he also asked a lot some fun questions that I could answer, which I noticed was not a thing the other North Americans (Canadian and American) I met did
I asked them quite a few questions about their country and life, but they *very* rarely asked me
Maybe they expected me to just tell them myself
I, a European, sometimes do that in the summer to feel a little rebellious >:) (but very rarely cause I don't want dirt on the carpet
> Flags
[We like flags too
I think people tend to prefer what they have always known
> it's nice but I can't help but feel wierd like "What do they want from me
At least you are from further south
Imagine what we are thinking up here
But really - most people find Americans refreshing
No fucking roundabouts
They were in a really tense political war with the USSR for about 40 years though
I kinda get it
Why do they feel more (Irish, Italian, Polish) than American I wonder
Same here
If anyone put this on their form it would be viewed as extremely racist and be front page news for weeks
They really are a fascinsting and terrifying breed
I mean what are you going to do when covid has a vaccine
They wont take it and presumably their kids are screwed too
Why not just get sworn in on the constitution
That's an important document in the history of the USA
If a president did chose to be sworn in on the Quran there would surely be outrage
I just find that there is such a juxtaposition between being very proud that there's a separation between church and state yet Christianity plays such a major role in policies and just a lot of the general life in the US
It's fine to be religious and that will affect policies, but it seems way more extreme in the US than in a lot of European countries for example
Ok, but still
What
In Norway it is illegal to give alcohol to minors under 18
Ignore how late I am, but globalization
Not the best quality photo, but it was the first one that came up when looking for one with a flag
A normal flag you are supposed to put up on special occasions only (someone in your family gets married, or turns 60 or on our constitution day and so on
) However - a triangel shaped flag (we call it vimpel, not sure what the English name is) you can have up all year around
> but when you are walking in the street and the stranger smiles at you it feels wierd
I have been out smiling at people today actually
And even had a short conversation with two strangers
(One lady asked for the way, and a guy had a dog that was eager to greet my children)
So these things even happen up here
Yeah
That's a generalization about the US, at least in Norway - lol
But are for instance Americans with Asian heritage doing the same
30% Indian, 50% Indonesian and 20% Mongolian
You could prob get away with it being mandatory in Europe, Scandinavia, uk etc but I think what worries me about the states is if you make it mandatory - I think they are armed and angry enough to literally start riots ‘rise up’ etc
They’re so over dramatic and liberty / rights are godly virtues, I wouldn’t be surprised if lives are lost
Your state may not officially be part of church, but church and religion still heavily affects the state
That's the juxtaposition I find strange
We do not have a state church any longer
That was changed back in 2012
Now personally I find it very hypocritical that lots of Norwegians still baptize their children when they don't go to church or believe in God
I am not one of those people though, so I can't speak for them
For reference, here in Norway we don't have a drinking age per se, but the stores are prohibited from selling beer to anyone below 18 and wine+liquor can only be sold to people aged 20+. The same goes for pubs
If you can acquire alcohol as a teen, have at it
It is of course prohibited to personally sell or gift alcohol within the aforementioned limits
That's so wholesome
Well, at least there is Finland
Sure, as Christianity is the major religion that will mainly affect policies and tradition
That's natural
I still find it .. odd
Like take abortion as an example, which I realize is controversial in general, but in the US (and other countries) religion decides a lot of the laws surrounding abortion
The US is supposed to be the land of the free, yet a lot of states make it near impossible for women to get an abortion due to religion
I'm not saying you have to support abortion, but the choice should be up to the woman and what she believes in
It's still called the "Church of Norway", but it's no longer the state church
I would say a majority of people still baptize their children and most young people have a church confirmation
I also find it very lazy that people just baptize their children because it's tradition, but then again I was not baptized, I am not religious and I would not baptize my own children
I actually feel like it's quite disrespectful actually towards those who genuinely do believe in God and feel a strong connection to the church
There are a lot of beautiful churches
The old stavechurches are very special
The funny thing about that is that a lot of the people who are so intensely against abortion are also pro capital punishment
If murder is wrong surely it's also wrong to kill a criminal, even though a criminal could be seen as a bad person
Well, I'm glad that I as a non-religious person isn't way off base when it comes to thinking that "tradition baptizers" are kinda disrespectful, lol
Oh, that's cool
Lots of people of Norwegian ancestry up there, right
Well, yes there will always be variation
I'm just speaking about the general vibe you get from the media (both local and international)
Damn, almost more Norwegian Americans than Norwegians in Norway
That's true
Don't meet many Americans in Norway, if they're here they're probably looking for the northern lights or Frozen-land
I try to read threads on Reddit, but that can be quite the clusterfuck to say the least
Sheesh, there are so damn many people in the US
Norway is pretty great when you get over the prices
Beautiful nature, with lots of variation
Ohh, I'll check it out
Thanks for the link
Yes, we have paid leave when moving
And I don't know how many countries have this, but in Norway you can get paid a full salary if your child can't attend child care for medical reasons or the child is sick and needs 24/7 care at home for a longer period
In norway you have 3x 3 day sick leaves per year, you can take out on your own volition and without any required advance warning
As far as I understand there is also 16 weeks that  can be arranged among the parents however they want
In total it is 49 weeks (if you want to get payed 100% salary)
15 for dad, 15 for mom
And also  3 additional weeks for mother which is for the time  right before the birth
(Plus the 16 weeks I mentioned
For 80% salary it is 59 weeks in total
I would say having paid leave when moving is probable the least important paid leave of them all
Most people would be able to move over the weekend instead of in the middle of the week
But - paid sick leave for all workers is something the US really needs
You are right, 49/59 weeks in total is correct - plus the last 3 weeks before birth, so 12 months in total
It's really hard to make friends after you have finished education
It's not that much of a problem for Norwegians who are used to it and retain their friends from youth, but it leads to older immigrants often struggling to make local friends despite being largely accepted, sadly making integration more difficult for them
The best advice is to get a hobby and meet people that way
My god, is it expensive
When I left Norway I was blown away by how much less I was spending every month
Transportation, food, bills - all very steep
As someone who's lived a long time abroad, we do have it VERY nice in Scandinavia compared to a lot of the world
Not perfect by any means, of course, but it is really good
And that is not to toot our own horn or anything
Our reputation is not completely unwarranted, though it can be a bit overhyped
That said, we are not THAT far ahead of some of our neighbours, like Germany, Finland, and even the UK, and some other places in the world like Canada, Australia, South Korea, etc
We can be quite arrogant and entitled, and there is a lot more casual racism than most natives would admit (not quite as systematic and oppressive as say the US, but it definitely exist in social)
There is also an insane amount of ineffective bureaucracy here for major projects, leading to further increased costs
My Town has blocked off one our major streets for a year and a half to create something like 150 meters of sidewalk
Most of the time no-one is working there, but the road remains closed
Our seasons can br a bit more extreme than most foreigners realise, and it only gets worse the further north you go
This does not only include temperature, but also daylight, rain, etc
Cost of living can also be quite high, even compared to our increased wages
This is not a Scandinavian problem only, but I think what might be the biggest surprise for people moving here (if you only come as a tourist you wont necessarily notice) - is the level of racism
We might not be as vocal and violent towards immigrants as in certain other countries, but racism is still effecting most (all
) immigrant on one level or another
240 er den foretrukne rånebilen her
I so wish we had a cafe and restaurant culture
It's one of the underestimated things I'm the most envious about from the south
It is meaningless to call it steep unless you compare it to your income
Prices may be lower abroad, but the same goes for salaries, so your actual purchasing power might be the same or worse
Meanwhile, Sweden is the country we go to for cheap wares
Always thought that was a German thing, so shows how much I know
I have a theory there:
- We get less D-vitamins than people living in countries further south
- We Nordics live more apart than relatives further south
We are independent, which is good, but we sometimes don't realise how important close contact with family and relatives are when it comes to mental health
I met people trough hobbies
also friends of friends and online like deviantart, instagram, hobbygroup on fb
Anine and manga is pretty popular and we used to have a big con each year with over 10 000 people ( sadly they stopped due to unpopularity over how they treated artstands and how expensive it was) I met some good friends trough that
So hobby is one of the best ways to get friends :)
I think it's a lot easier to get to know Norwegians outside of Norway
I have heard some Americans complain about the same thing I am, but particularly in Europe it seems like it's not too unfair to generalize it to the north whereas the south is typically more outgoing in both a casual and meaningful way
People are a lot less interested in interacting with people they don't know in a way that is meaningful
This is all just my personal opinion of course
No, but it seems to be more prominent the further north you go and Scandinavia makes up a decent portion of the north
In my experience it is a contrast to how in e.g. Greece or Spain people seem warmer towards strangers and it's easier to make a friend of someone you just run into somehow, and I wish we'd be more like that here as well
I live in northern norway, it's alot darker here, I think it starts in mid-september
Queues are prioritized
Cancer has a high priority, something that's uncomfortable but probably not dangerous or progressing gets a low priority
You are obviously not Norwegian
Here sweden hate is not exclusive to the internet, but its mostly just satirical
I was shocked about how cheap everything was when I went to Tokyo
A bottle of half a liter pepsi costed 8 kr
Pretty big difference from 22 kr
We went to an highend resturant and got a 3 dish meal ( apetizer, main dish and dessert) for 400 kr
I can't belive people think its expensive in japan :')
My income stayed the same
I was still working for the Norwegian company who paid me the same salary, but I was living/working abroad
I live in Hungary now and while things are generally cheaper here I was shocked to learn that clothing and electric products were almost the same price as back in Norway
I feel sorry for people who need to but that on a not-Norwegian salary
Groceries are typically quite cheap though, and the difference in the price of alcohol is just insane
The price of beer at bars in Norway is a great factory to why pre-parties are a big part of Norwegian culture so you can save money on getting drunk *before* going out
I suspect not, as he/she is absolutely right
Most foreigners tend to befriend other foreigners
[Here] is a list in Wikipedia
Don't know how up-to date it is
Gå for en Amazon da
De er tøffe biler som er ganske sjeldne
I hvert fall her på berget
Yeah, we're good at English, but that does not mean we want to use it at our jobs or personal lives
Now be me who currently live in Hungary where beer and wine typically cost about one tenth of what it does in Norway
Just my nationality makes me feel so privileged it's almost humiliating
A lot of people here don't realize just how lucky we are
There are some pretty idyllic towns along the southern coast which are almost never mentioned to foreigners because they're pretty far from mountains and fjords
From Egersund in the west to Kragerø in the east, there are around 10 towns which share a similar style, often bright white houses on relatively narrow, winding streets leading down to a coastline with inlets and archipelagos
The southern coast is well known in Norway as a summer destination, but I don't think it sees that many foreign tourists
It's in my German school book and my teacher went there so maybe not a secret
The Dutch word for people is mensen (if I remember correctly)
Mensen in Norwegian is your period (ya know, bloody monthly mess)
We have Pikk, pronounced exactly like Pick, but it means dick
The Norwegian word for catching someone, as in to solve a case and apprehend the criminal, is to "fakke". So there is some resemblance with fuck here
In Norwegian: Snop means candy
In Swedish: Snopp means a cock
(There's a slight difference in pronounciation, but not enough to avoid confusion)
In Norwegian: Bolle means bun
In Danish: Bolle means to fuck
In other words - we're an innocent bunch compared to our rancid neighbours
I would like to add some similarities between Norwegian and Swedish as well that I can think of right now:
Glass (NOR) is the same as in english, but glass (SWE) is the same as ice cream
Rolig (NOR) is the same as calm or relaxed in english, but rolig (SWE) is the same as funny
Norwegian: Bestemme = decide/be in charge
Haha, it probably said "fartskontroll" but I get why it's funny
There is actually a Norwegian Racing driver who is notoriously bad at english and he has some pretty good quotes to him:
"It's not the fart that kills you, it's the smell" (fart = speed and smell = crash/bang, depending on context, in Norwegian)
"I had a stop in the start"
"I'm driving around the corner, and crash in the Christmas tree"
"I had bad pigs in my dekk" (pigs mean studs, and dekk means tires in Norwegian)
"But but, it isn't only only you know" (a normal Norwegian saying directly translated to English)
"The ratt is loose" (ratt = steering wheel)
I don't have any trusted sources for these sayings though, but any Norwegian should be able to confirm :p
Iceland
No mosquitoes
Well, I don't really want to leave Norway, but Denmark I guess
Switzerland or Italy
I either want it pretty cold or pretty warm
As long as there is little rain I frankly don't care
I don't really know, but I've always wanted to live in Spain
Specifically Madrid, although I've never been
Really just wanna live there, get a decent job and watch all of Real Madrid's home matches, honestly
I know a bit of Spanish, and could probably learn it fluently if I really wanted to, but yeah
I'm not sure, maybe Croatia
I'm tired of all the rain and darkness in the winter here
Czechia, just based on the beautiful nature in kingdom come deliverance
There's loads in the summer
Especially in the north
In my experience not a lot but there are some
Nightlife and drug capital of Europe
We don’t get it either
The fact that I don't want to leave Norway is the thing stopping me
Sure, I can understand Danish, but I'll stay here
Haha that’s cute
greetings from Bergen, Norway, the rainiest city in europe
Det finnes ikke dårlig vær, bare dårlige klær :)
The way swedish sounds like to other scandinavian speakers is like; their words (especially the endings to words) are similar to many extremely rural dialects, but they speak with the most feminine and seemingly arrogant (to us at least) intonation; so to me they’re just posh farmers ;)
Well, I'd choose Denmark *because* it's similar and I like our country already
Zuid-Dietsland
Was on vacation in California, swimming in the pool at a hotel when I heard some young men speaking in Swedish about the exercises I was doing in the pool
They were complaining that women do too many weight loss fads
I don’t speak Swedish, but it’s close enough to Norwegian that I knew exactly what they said
I didn’t say anything, just glared
Was in Greece with a friend, we were around 16
We overheard these two girls speaking about those two cute guys over there in swedish/norwegian
Got ourselves a couple of dates for the rest of the trip
Not much of an experience, just a couple of Japanese chicks who were commenting on the food I was carrying on public transport, on my way home from work
弁当持ってるじゃん！
About 2 years ago me and my gf went to a restaurant in Oslo for her birthday and while ordering I noticed a man and a woman (probably husband and wife) staring at us and the woman asks her husband "You think they're gonna run when the bill comes
" (as we were 16 at the time) and I turn around faking being surprised and I reply in german "No, why do you think we would do that
" and they just go full-on silent and for the rest of the evening
My girlfriend was probably more shocked than they were, as she had no idea I spoke german
In Norway you have to take either French, Spanish or German in high school, so she knew I took german, but not that I spoke it fluently About 20m later they pay the bill and get up to leave and the husband leaves me a 200kr note and says "Looks like we've learnt our lesson" and laughs
I wanted to give it back to him, but me being 16 with no job and a very costly bill coming soon I took the money
TL;DR - Went to a restaurant with my gf and german couple talks in german if we were gonna run when the bill came and I replied to them in german
The couple went completely silent and after 20m they gave me 200kr note afterwards and apologized
Checked Swedish wiki, it mentions that lingon jam is often served with meat dishes and blood pudding, so it does seem strange that he objected to serving it with sausage
And Tampere is not in a bilingual area, is it really all that likely that he would be understood
"I have a girlfriend in *country*"
I never knew there was another kind of card deck other than the “normal” aka French one
We use the french one with 52 cards and 4 types with one card in all types
I didnt know there exosted other styles of decks as this is the only one ive seen
Never seen it before, but as a very frequent cardplayer, it looks hella COOL, and i want a deck
We use a weird deck for Svarteper (Old Maid)
How interesting
Yeah, that's why I put normal in quotes
I know the french one as "normal" cards
I've never even heard of that game, lol
I had no idea there was so much to know about cards
Fascinating
Det er ganske kjekt, anbefalast
Kan spelast med vanlig kortstokk også.
They already do that here
I think the system works nice enough as it is
It could be better
My grandpa *really* shouldn’t be allowed to drive
I dread meeting him in traffic (I’ve already done it twice, not a good experience)
Interesting idea, but I guess it will vary greatly depending on where you live
Last time I took a taxi it costed me 500NOK (about 50€) for a 15 minute trip
To the local city it's a bit further, maybe 20 minutes
This was at night so prices are a bit cheaper during the day, but still, it would cost me about 100€ for a round trip to the local city
If you go there once a week, that's 400€ a month just for 4 trips
And then you have the other trips to get groceries and maybe see some friends
So you'd probably have to double that to 800€ a month in taxi bills
Now lets say you get a cheapish car for about 10k€, that you plan to have for 5 years until its too costly to keep anymore
Thats 2k€ a year, say 200€ per month
Include repairs/maintennace (150€), insurance (100€), fuel(70€)
Totals to 520€ per month, although, if you are unlucky with a lot of prpblems woth the car it could be much more expensive to repair
I think I'd keep the car until I couldn't drive anymore
I guess maybe I consider short distances to be longer than you haha
:D I don't  get me talking about people living in the outskirt that have an hour drive to the mailbox :)
It's not that rural here though, 5 minute drive to the store, 20 minutes to the city, an hour to the capital
There just isn't any public transport, which would make the equation different
5-10C, I will atleast wear a sweater, but jacket if i'm going to be outside for a prolonged period
0C - I'll concider wearing my winter jacket
Down to -10C where i definitely will wear a good thick jacket and something warm on my head
-20C I'll use Jacket + Wool underneath,  warm hat and gloves
-30C Thick jacket + Thick outer layer + wool underneath, warm hat, thick gloves
-40C i'll wear my winter hiking gear, which is basically the same, just rated for colder weather
Sidenote: -10C is better than -2C, and I'd much rather have -10C because all the moisture in the air has evaporated so it *feels* warmer
^^^ps, ^^^i ^^^live ^^^in ^^^the ^^^north
Over 15C - T-shirt
Below 5C - Spring/fall jacket
Below 0C - Light winter jacket or extra layer under spring/fall jacket
Below 10C - Winter coat
Winter, once it dips below 0⁰, I'd say its cold
But thats relative to where I live in Norway (Stavanger)
I used to live in northern Sweden (Skellefteå), I'd say under -10⁰ was cold
That said, once you hit -10⁰ its just fucking cold in general
I grew up in Australia too, there I'd consider anything under 4⁰ cold
Depend how you see it
A 'good jacket' as in 'my best jacket' is at -5C. I use a thinner jacket at warmer temperaures
T-shirt
------------- 20 C
Hoodie
------------- 10 C
Autumn coat
------------- 0 C
Winter jacket
------------- -20 C
Winter jacket, alpine pants, snow boots
Like, cold in the winter is below -10C. In the summer it's below 10C.
Around 5 degrees celcius
But we can be okay down to -20
A good jacket, as a winter coat
Well, I didn't wear one last winter, even at -10°C. Although I do consider it cold when it's below 0°C.
20°C is bathing weather
That is sometimes the hottest temperature we get in Northern Norway
Came here to say this
Nothern Norway is cold af
Depends alot on the wind for me, -10 and no wind is great, can do in a t-shirt really
But a little movement in the air and it gets cold quickly
Worst weather there is is 0 to 4c, wind and whatever sludd is called in english
Wow, forgot about that
Thanks
I think it's called slush in English
But yeah, wind plays a big role in whether it's cold or not
Mostly just a stream of associations, but I guess I can summarise the 3 first as union, empires, and culture
Really
I know we're strictly speaking in Europe, but here we tend to think of "the continent" as somewhere else
Move over, *I* live there
I definitely also think of blue
I think I have more in common with, say, Canadians than with the Mediterraneans
(To my detriment, to be sure
Sorry, Canadians
) But Sweden is at least slightly more continental than Norway
For me, the worst months are November and January
They're dark, dreary and wet
In December the streets and homes are filled with Christmas lights, which helps a lot
Having an alarm clock with a wake-up light is also an essential for me
Waking up with the light already on is so helpful in the morning
Well, you can see the darkness as depressing, and of course I also agree that the summer with light nearly 24/7 is much preferable
I don't live furthest north though, up there they  don't see the sun at all between roughly December 1st and January 15th
Down here sunrise in December is around 9:00, and sunset around 15:00
So it's dark when I drive to work, and dark when I drive home from work
However, every time of year has its charm
Summer of course with its long warm days, fall with leaves falling and the beauty that follows, and then winter with its harsh weather, cold temperatures and is a period where nature rests and recharges for the coming spring
Winter in nature is also beautiful, even in parts where there is little or no snow
Nature is resting, recharging, but still there is so much beauty in it
Especially if there's snow
Also, winter is the time of year to stay indoors, do hobbies you enjoy and listen to the wind howling and the forces of nature pounding on the windows and walls of your home and feel good being inside and warm
In short, enjoy each time of year, do something different during each season - it being summer, fall, winter or spring, and look forward to those things year by year
You know - there are lots of things to be happy about during winter as well
It can be indoor activities, outdoor activities, attend a choir, have fun playing handball with friends, you get the idea, something to do during the dark months that makes you look forward to them
It's about mindset, it's about enjoying what you have, not wishing for what you cannot have if you get the idea
Good luck, and I hope you'll be fine
I use my Philips Hue lights as a wake-up light, which helps a lot to get me out of bed, and bright lights in my bathroom to stay awake
I also try to do something outdoors every day
This winter it rained something like 30/31 days in january, which honestly was more of a challenge than the darkness
December has Christmas, which helps a lot
February has a school holiday, which we use to visit family
January hopefully has snow, which gives us a chance to go skiing, and the kids can go sledging
Some of us even somewhat like the darker and rainy (snowy) months just for the fact that we can snuggle up with a book or in front of the TV without feeling too guilty about it
Summer was anyways never my favorite time of year
My favorite is autumn, and second favorite is spring
So although winter is my least favorite time of year, but it does have it perks
Remember to Get your vitamin D in
It helps a lot
And is what is keeping me going during the winter
You're saying you don't alternate between not going above and not going below the horizon for months upon a time
Daylight lamps do help against it
Also, where I live we often make iy more cozy with candles and stuff
So I guess the best thing is to just try to make your indoors very nice and comfortable
In norway we have an expression called kos or koselig
And thats what it's about, make it cozy around you and just make the best out of it
I have alot of experience with this, at worst we probobly only have one hour of daylight in a day
What makes it worth living here is the 23 hours of sunlight in a day in the summer
Keeping your rooms bright will help, sometimes I even sleep with the lights on, but also try to learn to appreciate the darkness
Try not to let it stop you from doing things, especially outside
Go out of the cities on a clear night and make a night picnic to see the stars (which is amazing as a romantic date, speaking from experience)
Take a walk by the rivers or parks (I did this while in Melbourne for a few days, and it was beautiful)
If you have any interest in photography, taking ohotos at night can be really fun too (experiment with long exposures and such)
It's in darkness that the lights are allowed to play
Wet in January
It's snowing here right now
> And eating more sweets because it's Christmas season helps
I pig out on the savoury stuff
Like some of the cheeses I stash in the spare fridge for a few years to mature
You get sunlight
> autumn
> shirt-weather
Something's not adding up
February can be pretty sad, but it's such a short month and since I'm a teacher, we usually have the winter holiday at the end of the month, so it doesn't feel so bad for me
Having something to look forward to helps a lot
At the end February we have winter holidays, so that helps a lot as well
I'm a huge fan of skiing and biathlon, so I do love waking up early, lighting some candles, making a good breakfast and enjoying the skiing
LOL, so glad I have winter holidays in February
Yep
I absolutely love mine
West coast, lol
It snowed just this morning here, actually
Ooh, interesting
In Norway schools have the period between Christmas and New Year off and come back around 2-3-4th Jan, but then we have a winter holiday at the end of Feb usually
I know people bike to work in Norway all through the winter and I just don't understand
Now, I'm on the west coast and we barely get snow, but it's just so wet and cold
I can't imagine biking to work
When you have a weeks holiday in a three and a half-ish week month that feels very short
I'm sorry :( My family hates me because I have all the same holidays as kids
One of the great advantages of being a teacher
It's not something I hear that often but I think we would say it like it takes balls without worrying about size
Because Switzerland
Forgot about that one
Legendary comment chain
I always vote for one of currently 3 parties that align with my views, depending on what particular issues are closest to me for the next 4-year period
Thing is, I never do ‘tactical voting’ because at the end of the day, I don’t feel like any of the parties in Norway are ‘bad’ per se, they just have different solutions to problems
Our closest thing to a far-right populist party is the closest I get to not wanting someone near parliment at all, but even they are just sometimes crazy right-wing liberals
Basically, I vote with my heart, and even if the opposition end up with the majority, I still don’t fear for my country at all with Erna Solberg in charge
> Have you ever voted on somebody/a party that you truly respect or believe in
Yes I have
At every election
Voting for me has always been about finding the party I agree with the most
Sometimes it's the issues, sometimes it's the values and sometimes is the people that are the deciding factors, but it's always the one I like the most
Of course no party perfectly mirrors my views, but I feel there are several that I mostly agree with and could vote for
I have always voted for the party I have believed the most in (i.e. never done any tactical voting), but I have also never found a single party here that I agree with everything on
> Thing is, I never do ‘tactical voting’ because at the end of the day, I don’t feel likr any of the parties in Norway are ‘bad’ per se, they just have different solutions to problems
I agree
I can't remember last time I saw a young person smoke
Very few teenagers start smoking these days as its seen as very unhealthy, and even more importantly - tacky
So the typical smoker is 40+. But even among the 40+ many have stopped smoking
Almost nobody smoke here anymore
It’s seen as a bad habit, unhealthy, out of fashion, uneducated and a plague for everyone around you hence the strict laws forbidding smoking in most public places
Left for the artists, the poor, hillbillies and bohemian to do
Im not shure, I dont know any thay do smoke to be honest
But smokers are usally pretty chill and good at beeing considerate here
They avoid standing so the smoke blow in peoples faces or just randomly smoke in a crowd
I feel like not that maney people smoke, but that might just be due to strickt rules about smoking in public
I feel the little bags of tobakko people stuff in their lips are more commen
Sadly many people spit them everywhere and just litter
Alot of people are great at trowing them away properly though
I think snus is an important factor as many switched to that
I don't have them but I believe the numbers for snus are not going down
I have been a smoker for almost 20 years, and I quit a year and a half ago
This winter I was invited to a party at my best friend's place, which took place in the winter garden
We were almost 20 people there, and the non-smokers were a minority
Mind you, this is a bunch of rural people who party almost every weekend
Guess smoking is more of a thing in rural areas and with people who party hard and often
Made me laugh
Thanks
I can barely remember seeing anyone smoking either
SSB (a statistics bureau) states that, in 2019, around 9% (!) smoked daily
Usage of tobacco products, however, is about 23%. That being the infamous snus (a variant of snuff) at 14%, which is only popular in Sweden and Norway, as far as I understand it (there is a EU ban on the product, with the exception of Sweden)

Edit: typo
How much is a pack nowadays anyway
150 kr
I'm sure many of us silently shame them inside our heads when we see smokers
Last time was yesterday actually
A older lady that sat down on the (rasteplass-) table next to us
My husband tried to hint that the wind was blowing all the smoke our way, but she probably pretended not to hear him
But a lot of the people I see smoking are often not Norwegian, but construction workers from Poland for instance
(For the record I like both Poland and Polish people) :) But nowadays no kids run to hide behind the school to smoke - like they did when I was a teenager
Times have changed a lot
Wow, I would have thought it was higher
It's not a very significant health risk, though, so for public health it is much, much better
You dont have to get nicotine either
I have vaped with 0 nicotine, I diden't want to get addicted
( i never smoked before so avoiding it sounded like a smart thing to do)
It dos taste good
But I don't vape much to be honest, I think last time was last year
Going from 24 to 3 is really good though
And just by vaping instead of smoking you are alredy doing you lungs a big favor :)
That is so true
And better for whoever is around as well
And yor breath, clothing, house won't smell like hells gate
I still remember that time I bought some manga on finn and had to leave them out on the balcony for 2 døgn to air out
They reeked of smoke
The kind that smell so strong that your house start to smell as well
Other that that it was in great condition though
Lovely people that sold them, hope their health is good
Well, we all like different things and thats alright :) Its good that it bring you good memories
My husband is Norwegian, so the choice of country was pretty easy
We chose to live here rather than in the States because in most ways, particularly those that are important to us, our life is better here than it would be there
Why Norway specifically
Depends on what you consider decent pay of course, but shouldn't it be quite easy to find that
We have (outside of current crisis time) low unemployment and lots of people move for work here every year
We're not Sweden
On holiday in Spain, picking up some fruit at a fruit shop run by an Indian guy
He starts some small talk in broken English, asks me where I'm from
I answer Norway
He looks at me, baffled, and said 'where
', so I said Norway in Spanish
Still looked confused AF
So I tried 'Scandinavia'. He still hasn't cottoned on
I sigh
Pick up my bag of mangoes and quietly mutter 'next to Sweden'
'AHHHH, YOU'RE SWEDISH
Feelings were felt
You
I like you
No, Norwegians have had their own identity separate from both Danes and Swedes for over a thousand years
Norway was under both of them under different times, but they were Norwegians none the less
Kind of like how Scotland is in a union with England, but they are not English, they are Scottish
Germans are not the same as Germanic though
By that logic Spaniards are Romanian, because they speak a Romance language
How does that make sense
I mean we function as a republic
It's not like the king actually decides stuff
He just stands there and waves
But, but, your flag is a cross like ours
Just like Iceland too
That must mean you're a part of Scandinavia
Edit: forgot the /s
That's disgusting
Oh my gosh mine did that as well
And then wouldn't shut up about how that was wrong
Wouldn't let me get a word in, as if I don't know a thing about my own country
Stockholm calls themselves the capital of Scandinavia, and we hate it
ok but what if i have potatos with my schnitzel can i then have sauce on my potatos or do i need to eat dry potatos aswell
Didn't think of that
In norwegian there is a difference between "kors" (Christian cross) and "kryss" (just two lines crossing)
Yeah
It's a result of the Austro-Hungarian Military Front against the Ottomans
Ah, I didn't mean to imply that there were no Serbs to begin with and then the austro-hungarians opened the door and suddenly there were tons of serbs
Of course there were Serbs there before
But, perhaps uniquely is the huge concentration of Serbs, that doesn't happen without some policy, I thought you could accredit this to the military frontier with the Ottoman Empire
When it comes to the YSR-borders, I'm an amateur, but I though the Croatian border came from the old internal borders from the Austro-hungarian borders + some border changes from world war 1
Block out curtain are a must
I lived in northern Norway for a little bit, and I am convinced that's how I got any sleep at all
For some reason I always see Europeans at reddit staunchly and stubbornly argue that people go topless all the time at European beaches, but I wouldn't even say it counts for 10% of women, not even 5%. You always see someone when in the south, but they are rare, and in Norway they are non-existent
There will be exactly zero topless women on regular beaches
But if you walk along the coast to more secluded places, or even on the many many small islands, you might stumble upon somebody enjoying the sun fully
Both topless and maybe also nude
His numbers was right  before cellphones got cameras, yours is right now, IMO
It varies a lot
Germany is the most naked nation on the planet, but it's difficult to give any estimations on the percentage
When I was a kid topless was more or less the norm in Spain
A lot of women were topless in Norway too
In my experience, Italy and France see little topless sunbathing nowadays
Spain is a lot more, but only on the beaches outside the vacation industry on the Mediterranean coast
Costa Brava has almost nothing, while Costa de la Luz has a lot
Topless swimming and sunbathing is on the increase in the Nordics at least, from virtually nothing to a few recent years
I've never seen a single women do that on any beach I've been to
So 0% is my experience
In norway pretty much none
Topless on your belly is quite common
Lego prizes are about the same, but wages are a lot higher
So LEGO is not considered super experience
But since it's very painful to step on a piece of LEGO, we still try to somewhat limit the amount
The massive millennium falcon is roughly €650, while larger creator sets are €100-€150
Median monthly salary before taxes was €4500 in 2019, which I guess would be around €3000 after income tax
>  I’ve never googled names of anyone I personally know, and expect the same of others
Is this normal behavior for a host family in Europe
I would definitely Google someone if they were to stay in my house
>  They then brought up the fact that they googled me and that search result of my parent’s death at a small gathering (several other German friends) while I was present
This is extremely rude, though
>  example: court records will appear in google searches
I do not think that is the case in Germany
Privacy is valued so theses things are not searchable online
They googled you because you were going to live with them
It makes total sense to me and I would absolutely do that
There would be no reason for them to feel embarrassed about it, because it’s not a weird thing
And our court records aren’t available, and I think the same goes for Germany(?)
**However** bringing up what they did and in that manner was not ok
First of all, bringing up someone’s dead parent is something that one should be very careful with
I can understand if they just wanted to let you know that they’re there for you, but then it should be done gently
And to bring it up in front of other people
What the hell
We respect privacy a lot, so if I found out this I would not tell other people or bring it up like that
I probably would not have brought it up at all and let you say it when you felt like it, if you did, unless I saw that you were struggling and thought you needed some support due to what had happened (and then I might not have said it directly, just tried to ask if you wanted to talk about something, it would depend a little on the situation)
Would I at least check out the person's facebook page
Yes I probably would
Especially if the person were to live in our house, being around my children for a while and so on
Would I ask about the person's parent's death while hanging out with a group of people
Most certainly not
That was just incredibly rude
I would *definitely* Google someone if I was gonna let them live with me for a year
I mean, if I found out they were racist or something I would never let them live with me
It seems like common sense to google them
I think it's a bit unfair to use Beowolf, as it's a highly poetic language
It makes Old English seem even more different than it was
Here's an easier text:
> Cnut cyning gret his arcebiscopas and his leod-biscopas and Þurcyl eorl and ealle his eorlas and ealne his þeodscype, tƿelfhynde and tƿyhynde, gehadode and læƿede, on Englalande freondlice
*Cnut, king, greets his archbishops and his lede'(people's)'-bishops and Thorkell, earl, and all his earls and all his peopleship, greater  and lesser, hooded and lewd(lay), in England friendly
This one is much more understandable
Early modern: with some difficulty
The most baffling bit is how the writer uses the word "wood" for
an army
Middle English: easy-peasy
"Wer" means "man" (as in werwolf), so "his lordes werre" must mean the lord's men
Old English: this is hard
I guess the text is about Grendel, and it's not a fan
Comparing him to Cain
No, I can't read this
The oldest English: About Norse gods
I think "Nu" means "now" (same in Danish), "fadur" means "father" ("fader" in oldfashioned Scandinavian), "eci" might be "not" ("ikke" in Norwegian), "barn" means "child" in Norwegian, "æfter" must mean "after" ("efter" in Danish), and "allmectig" certainly means "almighty" ("allmektig" in Norwegian)
The two first on the list went by very well
I think the only reason I can get through the old english one is because I live in a country where reading old norse is a part of school and my norwegian class teacher took that part very seriously
i can understand just about every word from early modern, middle and scottish english
but old is nearly impossible
The first one was something like "u lie, u die" the second one was "brave and good knight", third one was somerhing like this "æ".
Good thing they were warned by prophecy then, or they wouldn't have known something was wrong when a forest showed up on their doorstep
I suspect someone from Iceland miiiiight understand more of the old english one but I'm lost, could just get a word here or there
Written icelandic is very similar to old norse, so in theory it sounds like it should help
> Marzanna
Who was she historically
You do the bonfire to scare away witches too
And Norway
Ah ok, so not based on a real person
Oh you pagens
;) We do St
Hans as well
But no witch involved
It's celebrating the birth of John the babtist (who was born 6 months before Jesus)
No reason really
I had just never heard about this particular tradition before

Yeah I didn’t find the cafe con leche bit strange at all
It might be because I’ve travelled to Spain a fair bit, but I see cafe con leche as it’s own thing and it would be meaningless to say just «coffee with milk» which doesn’t sound very exciting at all
Is this an actual transcript
Haha okay
Sounds very Soviet
Oh dear god

From Wikipedia: Between 10 000 and 12 000 children were born to Norwegian mothers with German partners during the occupation
After the war these women especially, but also their children, were mistreated in Norway
I think mistreating the women is one thing (and I don't believe they deserved to be mistreated), but mistreating the *children*? WTF
What did they do wrong
We have the sami people who live in the north, in the end of the 19th century the ethnic norwegian government decided it was a good idea to assimilate the sami people into norwegian culture
They had to go to norwegian boarding school where the teachers spoke norwegian, they were not allowed to speak their native language at all
This severely damaged the sami culture in Norway
Dont forget that we sterilizated the Roma population intill the 70’s.
This is madness
Viking stuff I guess
Well it started as an union with the marriage between the royals, and somewhere down that road the royals decided to just daneify the whole of it
The historical treatment of sami, romani, and gypsy peoples stand out
How jews were deported by willing Norwegian collaborators during WW2
The post-war treatment of girls who had fell in love with German soldiers (tyskertøsene)
The lack of support for the war veterans, in particular the war-time sailors of the trade fleet (krigsseilerene)
Well
Australia *is* better than USA
Gone wrong
sacrelidge norwegians only enjoys snus every 30 minutes
Damn
Glad i'm above average then
Last thing i do before bed
Bak en pris snus
The first thing in the morning after peeing and brushing teeth
Bak en pris snus
Yup, same in Norway
A Norwegian who doesn't know how to ski
I hate skiing
I’m a Norwegian that hates skiing
A norwegian who doesn't eat fish or can't ski
A Norwegian that doesnt like Brunost (Browncheese)
A norwegian that has never gone skiing
I am an Norwegian that is unintrested in cross country sking
I'm one of those few Norwegian that can't ski
I blame it on my Danish genes
Ooh, he might be me
No skiiing school trips
I can ski but i dont like it
But i like downhill
Though i'd say not liking kvikk lunsj is worse
No skiiing school trips
Alpine skiing is fun, but cross-country is the one ultimate Norwegian activity
I'm not saying that I don't know how to ski
It's the same in Stavanger, but people usually travel to Røldal or Sirdalen to ski
Have you heard abaout voss
Waterskiing
I had 2 week-long skiing trips to Røldal when i was taking the Sports-line in Sandnes highschool
I got okay at slalom
Mostly pizza - French fries - pizza - French fries
Got really good at falling without injuring myself though
I can't say the same as im a no
Skiier from nordland
I ... don't feel bad
As a Scando I read this with an accent that would be incomprehensible to any Portuguese or Spanish speaker
It's gotta be someone's kink somewhere, props to you for taking on that duty
Sola - feminine
Månen - masculine
In my dialect we say "solen", masculine, as we don't use feminine grammatical gender
*Sol* (sun) is feminine and *måne* (moon) is masculine
You can also refer back to them with gendered pronouns (she & he)
In norwegian Månen is masculine and Sola is feminine
But if its any sun, not ours, it can be masculine, "en sol".
In Norwegian the moon is masculine (månen=the moon) and the sun can be both feminine and masculine (solen/sola=the sun)
In Norwegian the sun is female: Ei sol - sola
The moon is male: En måne - månen
But probably most commonly the sun is reffered to as female
Sola is female
In norwegian you can use male article for female, but not the other way around, e.g. Ei jente / en jente
Swedish has genders though, the common gender and the neuter gender
There is also the feminine gender that still lives on in some dialects
I assume you are from Bergen
I am
I'm not just talking about feminine and masculine here
Swedish has two grammatical genders, common and neuter
The golden age of Norway is modern day Norway
It's hard to argue otherwise
Agreed
Independence, wealth, relative equality, peace, and even a decent amount of soft power
Yeah
I think the viking age was the last time before this that could in any way be considered a golden age
I went to tivoli, the amusement Park in the middle of Copenhagen and went on one of the rides
I thought it would be a laid back type of ride, like a kids ride, so I kept my phone in my pocket instead of leaving it
Turns out, the ride was not meant for kids and it started to do flips and all sorts
I heard a loud bang
That was my phone sliding out of my pocket, hitting the ground and going under the ride
I had to wait 2 months for them to find it and ship it back to where I live in Norway
Tldr; my phone went under an amusement ride and didn't have a phone for 2 months
Crossing the road is always a lot scarier in other european countries especially in Greece
[A truck loaded with] 27 metric tons of Norwegian brown cheese crashed in a tunnel in Norway, due to the high fat high sugar properties of the cheese it burned for 4 days straight closing the tunnel for a further week for repairs
This wasn't in my city, but in Oslo, a teen hit an old german lady with a waffle, yelling "Luftwaffel". But the teen was from a region called "Jæren" which I live in
So it kinda counts
That is hilarious
Thanks for sharing
...you guys have a profanity book
Because I would like to learn some more polish swearing
I actually bought my brother a rather large swearing lexicon with any known, and lots of less known, Norwegian swear words
It was hilarious to see our prudish step mom's face when he unwrapped it
I've stolen lots of fun things while drunk, but never a live animal
Let alone a lama, which is one of the coolest animals
I wish I were as awesome as these guys
You’d think so but the British ton is the long ton, which is 2240 pounds, and the U.S. ton is the short ton which is 2000 pounds
Both tons are actually defined in the same way
A metric ton, equal to 1000 kilograms, or approximately 2204 pounds
The metric ton is officially called tonne
According to gugl
How dare you mr surströmning
Sadly, I only know kurwa
But on the plus side, when I use it sparingly, my sweet polish female colleagues are shocked every time
Oh yeah, you know it
Dobre
This might come in handy
He used the fruit tag to be able to scan it and place it in the bagging area like normal without causing extra suspicion in case someone were there
Though he probably did it when nobody was looking
A teenager buying a ps4 in the self checkout should make an employee take a closer look
Honestly, most of the southern/south-eastern coast of Norway is pretty beautiful too
From the area around Kristiansand at the southern tip and up east to around Larvik
It's pretty flat and doesn't have the same spectacular mountains of the fjords in the west, but in summer it's absolutely beautiful
You're from Arvidsjaur, right
So people in bigger cities are impolite
Sorry mate, not having it
I think I'll second this one
The most important language to learn would be the dominant language of the place where you intend to live
Aside from that, however, most places in western Europe you will get by incredibly well with English
So if you want to learn a language that will really open up new possibilities, then Russian will do that for you
>in the Nordics, there is (or was
) a tradition of leaving babies out in the cold
Do you mean just for sleeping
Because yeah, that is pretty common
At first when I read it, I thought you meant we killed babies by putting them outside in the snow or something, I certainly hope people don't think that
We also call it Gløgg
I saw Glühwein of white wine in Hungary, is that also a thing in Germany or would it be considered strange
Ditto in Norway
"Gløgg" can also mean smart/bright
Hey
We also hate them
Especially the Swedes
That's like us and the paper clip
We got roads with holes in too and roads just consisting of mud which probably haven’t seen any maintenance for decades
Its a sibling-type relationship
I will make fun of Sweden till the day I die, but damn you if you make fun of them
They're *my* annoying "big brother" to make fun of
I feel making a nazi joke to a German would just be
mean
Like, haha your past generation were super duper evil and so are you probably
No, dude, don't rub the salt in, Germany is great at teaching about their past wrongdoings, way better than most of us other Europeans (I mean I did learn of the discrimination and cultural genocide of the Sami, but could probably have learned more)
Also I really like Germany in general, and it's actually fantastic that it has kept its "Germanness" so well after what the nazis did to the country
Yep, I gotta agree with this
Hi hi
Kamelåså! Cracks me up every time
> no one in Scandinavia would call Finland Scandinavian
Because it isn't
Especially as written Norwegian is directly copied from written Danish then 3% adjusted to spoken language
(Don't mention nynorsk, let it die)
I had a discussion with my mom (who's born in Denmark) about this the other day, but we didn't really reach a conclusion: Why is it that danish, norwegian and swedish are considered three separate languages, instead of dialects of the same one
(especially danish and norwegian)
I do as well but I was wondering if it would upset some purists, or be seen at as how the Italians view putting ketchup on pasta
Never heard of Pat and Mat, but Krtek is(was) famous
Edit: and of course Three Wishes for Cinderella / Tři oříšky pro Popelku
Nynorsk is the best
It may not be a pretty language, but the Danish are definitely the most fun out of the Scandinavians
Your smallish city would be the second biggest in Norway lol
>Once I heard someone call French \*the Danish of romance languages\*
That actually makes sense in an odd way
Sweden getting all the credit, smh
No one notices Norway
We the uncool little brother of Scandinavia
Sweden is the popular girl, Denmark is the life of the party, and Norway is the little brother who saves all his pocket money and enjoys watching 134 hour live footage of Hurtigruten on the weekends
Ran out to the car to grab something my first winter in Skjellefteå with wet hair
It froze solid
I went to scrunch it, but thankfully someone stopped me in time
Norway is experiencing a bit of a "glowup" though
Maybe one day in the future we won't just be known as the sensible one
>Is it the way you pronounce it
The sound
The vocabulary
I'm probably not the best at explaining it, but it's mostly the former two
The sort of similarity with French would probably be mostly due to the tendency to not pronounce the end of words
Sure, we have *some* silent letters in Norwegian as well but not nearly to the same degree
But mainly it's just the way things are pronounced
If e.g. an Italian read a Danish word and the Norwegian equivalent I'd wager that they would in the majority of cases be far closer to correct pronunciation of the Norwegian word than the Danish
The vocabulary isn't anything special except the rare false friends that similar languages often have
E.g. to "Grine" means to laugh in Danish and to cry in Norwegian
If you want a short and actually linguistically accurate video on why Danish sounds funny to Scandinavians this is a good one:
Edit: they also have the same guttural R as the French and most Germans, which is uncommon in Norwegian, Swedish, and other romance languages than French
I don't really think French or Danish sound bad, just strange and a bit ...messy
If I read an Italian word my accent would be dreadful but at least I'd probably be understood, but if I had tried to pronounce Renault for the first time without being aware that it was a French word you'd hear both the L and the T
Denmark has been in the news a lot during the pandemic
And besudes that, everyone knows about Denmark
Buttercookies, Danish, Noma, Roskilde, vikings, Hans Christian Andersen, Lars Ulrich, Kristiania, lego, hygge, Carlsberg and Tuborg, Smørrebrød are all internationally known things about Denmark
No, your hair snaps
Its quite logical when you think about it
The guttural R is used by about 25% of Norwegians, so I wouldn't exactly call it uncommon
That would probably be the WW2 traitor [Quisling
] His name is used for a traitor to this day, not only in Norwegian but in several other countries as well
Anders Behring Breivik could also be a good answer to the question
2 contendants
1: Quisling
He was in charge of the country and served the nazis in WW2
A traitor
2: Breivik
He shot a bunch of teenagers at Utøya and detonated a bomb in Oslo
July 2011 is often looked at as the bighest tragedy in Norwegian history
Oh and also Hitler
First thing that popped up in my head was Vidkun Quisling, but as pointed out, Anders Behring Breivik is also a good contender to that dubious title
Yup those two are the worst, and the most hated
I remember reading about the foreign office in the UK replacing the picture of Margaret Thatcher with Cromwell, and the next day there was a delegation from the Irish government visiting
I assume that ended up in a fistfight
I saw "Death of Stalin" recently and I can't imagine there is much love for Beria
But he's maybe not that known
I'd also say Breivik, especially now
Most evil and fucked up person we've ever had
Shooting is a bit mild
Not quite
He has been sentenced to the harshest punishment in the Norway
And while that may seem like it's only 21 years in prison, he will not be automatically released after 21 years
When he has served his sentenced 21 years, he will be evaluated for release
If he is found to be too dangerous to be released, he will serve for up to another 5 years before he is evaluated again
If he is always found to be too dangerous to be released, he will live the rest of his life in prison
I doubt he will ever be released
Both because he probably won't be rehabilitated, and because he could be in danger from revenge killing if he were released
But if he were rehabilitated, and he could re-enter society without being killed in revenge, then I would not view it as a mockery of Norway
He would instead be a living monument of the success of our prison system, and our ability to forgive as a nation
(But again, this is not the most likely outcome)
Must have been some awesome pussy
Norwegian is not a very complicated writing-language (But remember that we have two and one of them is very unfamiliar to even most native norwegians)
When it comes to my specific dialect, it’s one even my norwegian friends have a hard time immitating, so I’d say that’s something you have to grow up speaking to know
That’s the case with the entire language(like every other language) people who have grown from childhood with the language are probably the only ones who have a shot at sounding like a native speaker out of non-natives
it depends, if you already speak english (as most people do these days) then it shouldn’t really be that hard to learn the grammar
same goes for most germanic languages
from any other language families i simply couldn’t say
pronounciation and verbal understanding is the tricky part
pronounciation because norwegian uses alot of different sounds that are uncommon in, for example, english
and in norwegian there are hundreds of different dialects who vary vastly from each other
so much so that it can be genuinely hard to understand what snother norwegian is saying depending on where they’re from
examples of three different dialects here:
[1]
[2]
[3]
Grammar is easy, but pronunciation can be difficult to learn natively
Norwegian is tonal unlike most European languages, its why Norwegian is often perceived as as a bit sing-songy
Every single word in Norwegian is realized with either one of two tones at the stress of the word
We would understand you if you mix them up, but its hard to sound like a native without using the right tone
It's almost impossible to sound "native" from here
Even people who are born and have grown up in Norway don't sound native if they have a parent who doesn't speak Norwegian fluently
It's really easy to hear from either their choice of words/structure, or their tone
Every dialect pronounces their words differently
F.ex
those in the east go very high at their sentences, while those in my city go down
It's super easy to tell, because dialects can be very hard to master as almost no words are pronounced as they're written unless you're from the Oslo-area and speak almost completely bokmål. The grammar isn't that hard, it's everything else that will get you caught
It's so much more fun bullying the swedes, though
Hasn't been much to make else to make jokes about either
Haven't heard anything new from Denmark since ca
the 17th century
Unlike the famous comedy powerhouse that is denmark
Especially now :) The current favorite here is "when the dumb swede jokes aren't jokes anymore"
Unlike most people here I would not like that
Many jobs need to be done 24/7 and this would require employers, the largest one being the state, to hire many more people at a much greater cost
This leaves less money for welfare which e.g. us in Norway already probably will reduce due to oil becoming superfluous
I'd like to thank Denmark for coming to our aid in the most desperate of times, selflessly offering supplies in our national tragedy known as "The butter crisis" so our temporary period of suffering from lack of buttery goodness due to shortages was one of merciful brevity
Thank you Denmark and Sweden for raising us into a good country, and being our sister countries
(And a little extra thanks to Sweden for dealing with us on out harryturer, we're sorry for the chaos we cause)
Thank you Finland for being the nicest people in the North <3
Thank you France, Spain and Italy for your delicious food
Thank you Singapore for *your* delicious food, and for the awesome time I had there during my studies
Thank you USA for your music and movies
Thank you Netherlands for being so chill in general
And an extra personal thank you to Mauritius for giving me a very fond little, but important piece of my childhood when me and my family lived there
Maybe a bit cliche, but thank you to everyone for not giving up during the 2nd world war
I don’t think any country could have won without another
Let’s never let a war amongst us happen again please:)
All the countries that fought Nazi Germany
Thanks
Russia gave us Svalbard
I understand Swedish like 100%, not a problem at all
Danish I understand very well after a few beers, and it's pretty easy while sober, too
Finnish is just as different to Scandinavian as Lebanese is, so I really don't understand any of that
Icelandic is pretty much "Greek to me".
We Norwegians are able to understand swedish people easily, but only the spoken language
Reading swedish is much harder for us
Denmark is the exact opposite, we are able to easily read danish, but its hard to understand what they’re saying as they sound like they have a potato stuck in their throat
I understand written Swedish: 65% Spoken: 85%
Written danish: 100% spoken: 60%, if they speak slowly: 70%
Daily/hourly
I never have to scroll far on any of the major news outlets before I see an article about the US
Yeah, it's about every day
But I actually don't mind that much
I think it's importent to know whats happening because of the relations Norway has to the US
We need to know if Trump are going to fuck us over or try to buy Svalbard or whatever
(I know it's not likely, but that guy is insane)
When thats said, I don't care for the never ending news stories about mean politicans, racism, sexism, gun violence etc
It just makes me really sad
Regular stream of stuff that happens in the US
Stuff like wildfires and pther disasters get a light coverage, and politics  bit more since it affects us so directly
Especially NATO stuff, trade stuff and US-Russia stuff
BLM had stuff and explenations and
stuff
Which makes sense, it gre international, and human rights developments abroad deserves a spot in ones' daily news, I think
Not something to limit to ones' borders
I primarily watch/read NRK (it's free and high quality
There is probably a lot more juicy drama from the news outlets that make money
Always
It started september 11 2001 and then never ever stopped
When the wars became old/dated the broadcasters just started to report on all random crazy shit from the states
I guess they found a source of news too valuable to let go
Hourly
It’s litreally everywhere, you just can’t escape it, and it’s so annoying
It’s gotten way worse since Trump became president, I can’t even watch the news anymore
Pisses me off how they need to talk about every little thing Trump does
The media here is way too USA centric, we hear way too much about them compared to other countries
Take hurricanes as an example, live streaming 2 weeks in advance and 2 months after, while when Japan or China were drowning in the worst downpours and storms in centuries it’s barely mentioned, barely anything about the drought in Germany and France or last time it was horrible flooding in Central Europe
It’s not his voice or face or anything it’s just that the media won’t shut up about him, when he isn’t even doing or saying anything relevant
I don’t even dislike Trump I just couldn’t care less about what some governer in a place I’ve never heard about thinks of him
I’ve no concrete answer to it, but I’ve thought a bit about it and come to a few points I personally mean might be leading
First as others have pointed out the US is one of the most important countries in the world because of its power so it’s often regarded as somewhat important whatever happens there
Second Norway is one of the closest allies of the US (or the other way around) and thus US politics and affairs are regarded as central to Norwegian affairs
Third Norway as a country is much centred around USA and American culture in a general especially since WW2, in some ways I find Norway closer to US than the rest of Europe often
We're a close US ally
The general secretary of NATO is Norwegian
We're a very Western country that consumes a lot of American media
There's a lot of interest
My impression is that it has always been like this, while other countries are regularly covered the US is often the centre piece
Trump or not, but he has got a lot of focus yes
Actually our media covers a lot from particularly UK, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Russia, Brazil, Turkey, Iran and China, especially national broadcaster NRK as they have active correspondents there, a few newspapers are quite good too (especially Aftenposten), it’s just that news and reportages from the USA are prioritised and put up front
Belarus has been widely covered here lately as well
We are still close to most European countries, I’ll say just as much as to the US, especially the other Nordic family members
This is my favorite sub on reddit - you're doing great
Even when things go haywire in r/europe I know people in this sub are usually still able to discuss things in a healthy and respectful manner
That's one of the things I worry about losing when r/askeurope grows larger, so thank you mods for trying to keep it that way
I agree with all of those overdone questions
They get brought up too often, without checking if it's been asked the previous 2 hours
I think it's great to not just have the same questions over and over again in this sub
It gets old quickly
In short: no
I don't.
More elaborately: There are many different cultures within Europe
There are different identities in a single country
For example today is "[Kvenfolkets dag] in Norway
I feel somewhat close to Danes, a bit to Swedes as well
But that's really it
I don't think there'll be a "European state/federation" while I live, we've already got the EU
>Do you believe that we can create a new Nation,a new "Superpower" just by agreements,good words and peace
Not sure about "superpower", for the other stuff: we've mostly got that with the EU and EEA
In the sake of feeling "European": not generally speaking
I firstly identify with my city (Bergen) and the my country
However, my American friends refer to me as their "European friend" and I don't correct them, because the few times I've don't that I've had to explain where the heck Norway even is on a map, so I'm fine just being referred to as their European friend
Like I do know I'm european, but I only really Identify by my country, we have alot of different cultures, so I don't really think europe has a common culture in that sence
When ut comes to 1 federation, no, I don't belive we will ever be that, again, ee identify alot more to our country here is my guess
When it comes to violence and stuff, I think it is very naive to belive that
It's a nice though, but I just have lost too mutch hope in humanity to belive that
We share somewhat of a bond, but not enough to call it a common identity
Imagine each country being a household, and Europe as a whole is the neighbourhood
The different families know each other decently well, they are friends, unlike the other neighbourhoods downtown (other continents)
However, they aren’t SUPER close, and it would not be a good idea for them to all live in the same house, like in your hypothetical scenario
You share a stronger sense of identity with your family than the people who just live next to you, y’know
This isn’t really a bad thing, it’s nice that we are unique and can live in different ways, while still keeping friendly relationships across the continent
Yes I do believe it exist, although I would have problems explaining it
If I bump into a French person in South Africa I will feel a closer connection to him, compared to another person I bump into from USA, Japan, Chile or another African country
In spite of the fact that the cultures of Norway and France are still fairly different
Yes, but only in the sense of an umbrella term of lesser importance
While it is foolish to think the people close to the borders of Europe don't relate more to the people on the other side of the border than to the other side of Europe, it is also foolish to deny any common European identity at all
It's there, just a bit vague
Never expected a nuanced and reasonable take to be top comment, what a positive surprise
In some areas of western Europe, every single generation for centuries (if not millennia) had in some way experienced war
Areas which now have been at peace for over 75 years
The EU is without a doubt a key factor in this
I agree
Though I feel closer to the Nordics and the Netherlands, and maybe Germany/Austria than most countries
That doesn't really reach as far as Spain and France, I can't say that I feel there are a lot of similarities between Spain and Norway at all culturally
Being "European" isn't apart of my identity generally
I don't know about that one
Norway has a really strong sence of being their own nation as a result ow being owned by sweeden and demark for 400 year
I don't think we will accept that one again
I'm sorry to dissepoint you, but I would probobly this of Mesopotamia as the cradle of western civilisation
But obviusly greece and rome is important for stuff as politics and so on
Yeah, I could defenetly agree on that one
Except for kalmar 2
Our history does not see those things as anything good
Even though some sweeds, mostly danes never belive that one, but you know, they write histiry on the victory side while norway write it as the loosing side
We even call it the 400 year night
From a Norwegian perspective,  Denmark is part of Continental Europe
The EU is not the democratic paradise you think of it as
Countrys like France and Germany does really have the biggest voice in the EU and can easly fuck up for the smaller ones
I am so glad Norway is only in the EUS
We are sutch a small country that we would never have any actual power when it comes to EU regulations, in the EUS we have the right to VETO
Now I think it was wrong of the UK to go out, but when it comes to ut, it depends on the country
Yeah, I think some sweeds signed it, but they went out of it after 1 year or something
While Norway who diden't sign it at all was forced into danish rule, our military wasen't strong enough to fight them
So we besicly went under danish rule before the danes lost to sweeden and norway was givene to you guys
We did have a 2 weeks war with you, but eventually lost
But that was farmers against professional military
Well, I really don't think its the right choice for norway
I am not talking about leaving the EUS or EEA if thats wat it's called, but joining the EU is right for norway
And we don't get orders from the US anyways
Again I do not think it was right of britain to go out
And I am not against the EU project, but we have so many resources that the EU would fuck up
Right now they can't tuch our fising and agriculture industry, though they have already affected the agriculture with us bot being allowed to plant norwegian stoneage plants I guess, that is far better for the norwegian topography and climate
But it's not really the most important one
But just to give you an examole of the fishing industry, in the EU zone, all the oceans are overfished, thats the reason we have so many foreign fishing boats here
But since we have strict regulations on fishing with quotas, we have had a substanable level of fish in the sea
It is important that it doesen't get ruined
Lofoten for example is the biggest breedeing place of cod in the world
If that was overfished, we could potentially extinguish the cod
That is not good
This is all because of certain EU regulations
And I really do belive Norway would be way better out of the EU, but still inside EUS or EEA or whatever it is called
That does not mean that I wan't the EU to be weekned
There is alot of countrys that would benefit of being in the EU, especially in eastern Europe, but the EU won't let them in because they are too poor, can't remember exactly which ones right now
We also have a really great relationship with the rest of western europe
We even chose our royal family because of Queen Maud who was a british prinsess
You know, to get protecton from britain (a bit naive though when you think of history)
But again, we do have a great relationship with western europe, and we like to decide for ourselfs, being a "colony" for 400 years kinda does that to you
I know London gets a lot of hate on Reddit, and while I love London I can see a lot of the criticism
Anyway, the single worst tourist trap I have ever been to is Madame Tussauds in London
Holy shit, it's the worst
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
The actual worst
It's not that interesting, it's filled with moronic people thinking that they're hilarious for doing whatever stupid ting posing next to the Queen
Not a destination, but people come to north Norway to see the midnight sun
Why
It's just daylight at night
Not much to see really, and besides it's often cloudy and rainy, so it will be dark-ish anyway
Sure it might be special for someone who has never seen it before, but if you haven't seen it before, you are not exactly missing out
I did a biking trip along the Donau and stayed 2 nights in Bratislava
I honestly fell in love with the city and am eager to go back some day
I see what you’re getting at; Bratislava isn’t a city with many tourist attractions, venues or astounding nature, but it’s just very cosy in a way
A really nice city if you enjoy casually strolling through the streets and drink Zlaty bazant :)
Please say more
Im planning on going to the Netherlands/Amsterdam when its safe again, tell me more
Very famous clock
Very famous spire
123 meter
I’m from Norway and I would say Sweden ...Also Denmark, but mostly Sweden
Sweeden
Sometimes Denmark and Finland
We have a rivalry with Denmark and Finland about who's the biggest rival of Sweden
Sweden
Swede jokes are super common, jokes where we make fun of swedes
Denmark and Sweden is not any competition so I guess
Finland
You never feel more hurt and ignored than when your rival country Sweden say their rival country is Denmark
Pffft like you ever had a chance in skiing
I live on the south coast of Norway
We see Denmark as our (holiday-)friend
Although this year seems to be a bad one for our usual Denmark holiday filled with lots and lots of hygge
Finland
Have you heard the joke about the Norwegian, Swede, Dane and Finn
Nope
Only he Norwegian, Swede and Dane
(Although I cannot remember a single one right now
I feel like every Norwegian either likes Sweden and dislikes Denmark, or likes Denmark and dislike Sweden
Majority hates Sweden though
We need someone to take second place in skiing so we can keep swimming in all our gold medals you know
Denmark was way longer than Sweden, some 500 years almost
Under Sweden we only stayed for roughly 100 years, and had a lot more autonomy than under Danish rule
I still prefer Denmark over Sweden you know
If you make good akevitt you are my friends
It is hard to have Iceland as a rival
You guys are cool
I have some Icelandic friends, I like to call them reserve Norwegians, if that helps
If Norway is a sourdough bread, Iceland is the yeast starter we save in case we need  more bread
Thought this question was about sports and stuff tho
No, were not serious, søta bror
In public we hate you
In secret we love you
(But you won't catch us saying it out loud
No worries we still love our sibling
We just can’t stand you at all, not even for a second
At least we’re the hotter sibling
Stockholm is beautiful and all, but your country is a giant forest man, go hang out with Congo smh
Jk love you guys
Yeah, not serious at all
But please open borders after corona, we want to go in to buy stuff
Norway is tiny too
But, Faroe islands, they seem a bit dickish
Happened here in Norway a few weeks ago
It will now be renamed to Lake Blood
Gran Canaria
I love spain but gran canaria is packed with tourists all year
I prefer places like rural towns outside Valencia
Geiranger
Too many people squeezed into one small area, lots of cruise ships spewing out CO2, people even walking on top of graveyards even
There are far more appealing areas that is just outside Geiranger that is far more empty from people
I agree
I also read all of your answer here, and nobody mentioned what is most important to me
Why would any woman go willingly to a place where she is considered a second-class citizen
As a woman, in Dubai any man's word is considered more valid than mine, and I could go to jail for getting raped
(yes, that has happened, although not to me
The point is to smoke good quality weed in the open while drinking a nice milkshake
I can't do that in Norway
Only been there once, though
Says Mr
Rotterdam ;)
Something that I haven't seen any Scandinavians mention yet:
The word 'rar', which means 'weird' in Norwegian, but - from what I understand - means 'sweet' in Swedish
Norwegian and English has quite a few:
EN - NO
Fart means speed
Smell means impact (it's an onomatopea, kinda like "bang")
(which leads to the funny phrase: "it's not the fart that kills, it's the smell")
Hell means luck (which is why there's a town called Hell in Norway)
Crap (/Krapp) means a sharp (as in a sharp turn)
Pig (/pigg) means spike
There are many many more
We in Norway have the famous sentence: it’s not the fart that kills you, it’s the smell
Fart is speed and smell is impact
Also rape means burp
Norwegian: Bolle = bun, like the simple pastry
Danish: Bolle = to fuck
Dog can also be used in Norwegian, although you basically never hear it
You can say: Jeg liker all mat, dog ikke fisk(I like all food, but not fish)
What you will more commonly hear is: jeg liker all mat, **men** ikke fisk
Same sentence basically
Norwegian "rape" = to burp
Unless its a snusdåse
But it works in Norwegian
Where what you drink from is written glass like the ice cream in Swedish
aw well now it's not as funny :(
My only complaint is that the summers are getting too warm
I'm happy living here and probably won't move permanently anywhere, but I wouldn't mind living abroad for a year or two just for the experience
I like it
I wouldn't move unless something drastic happened
Its perfect atm nice weather summer, i would only consider a semester or two in the uk
I really like the security I have here, but I really want to move away for a couple of years just to experience a culture that isn't so
One-sided
A lot of immigrants really struggle to assimilate here because of [the Jante Law] and the "do not stand out"-culture that we have
It's hard to get new friends because you're not supposed to talk to others unless you know them from before
Therefore, Norway isn't just cold weather-wise
But yeah, I would like to move somewhere else for my Master's degree after I'm done with my Bachelor
It will probably be somewhere in West Europe like Germany or UK just because I know the languages and cultures
And the winters are lacking snow
We're hitting 30 at the moment, combine that with most people not having A/C and our houses being built for staying warm, shit's unbearable xD But we musn't complain, don't want the wrath of the gods do we :D
It's amazing to be honest
Great neighbours, except for well Russia but they barely border us and up in a place no one really lives
Also amazing landscape and scenery, massive coastline which is great for fishing etc
Also a country with 4 proper seasons, summers are nice and winters are lovely up in the mountains
My only complaint is that it sometimes feels a little far away from stuff
Opposed to living in say Amsterdam/Prague/Zurich just to take an example when you're just a relatively short train ride away from so many different countries and famous cities
Here you kinda have to fly to really get somewhere
But overall it isn't bad, I can't really complain at all
I love it, but theres one MASSIVE drawback
It's sooo cooold
I hate it
I love the nature and all but i hate the weather
It's to dark during the winter and to damn bright during summer
It rains to much and i would like summers with much more summer weather
Northern brethren
>Unfortunate neighbor
i know what you mean
Ah, the beautiful four seasons I have in Bergen
Rain, warmer rain, wind and rain, and colder rain
> up in a place no one really lives
\*Angry Finnmark noises\*
Kinda hard to say “it’s worth it” if you’re living in an autocratic state which jails journalists and goes more authoritarian by the day
A truly democratic rule-of-law Turkey would be amazing, however
Oooh, please don't use the ø that way
It looks like you are writing fjœrd, lol
You don't often read about your case: Nordics to Central Europe, so I'm curious
Why does it feel more correct
I assume atmosphere, people (more social
), maybe food
In all these examples or any other one, what is the differing factor that makes Central Europe more correct for you
You grew up in Norway, until you were old enough to move out, and you moved to Czechia
I dont really see how that makes sense
Work related
Or just feeling like it was better for you, if so, can you explain
I’m a Norwegian guy who’ve dreamt about moving to Central Europe for years, more precisely Austria or Germany, especially Vienna or Munich
It’s just that life in the Norwegian countryside/suburb to me is dull, I can’t connect with people, it’s directly antisocial
I would feel more at home there, things seems to be always correct, people seem to be more mindful and reflected
I just feel hidden away up here, locked up without possibilities
Norway is in many ways a cultural development country, especially if you aren’t lucky enough to live in Oslo

My mom got my great grandfathers old lada when he got a new one, and she got her licence
He was a cool man, lost one finger to the zee
I think the car was brought from russia to norway in a fishboat, tho, not necessarily legally
They were fairly popular in Norway during the early '80s and the brand had a market share of 3,5% in 1981 (at its peak)
They pulled out of Norway in 1997 though and I have never seen any more recent "grey market" models here
There is a song "for vi kjører granada jada det ekje noke lada" or we drive a granada yes it aint no lada
I remember that my uncle used to have one back in the 80s. From what I can find out online, they were fairly popular in the 70s and 80s due to being cheaper than most other cars
Changes in the tax regime meant that they became more expensive relative to their competitors, and there hasn't been any official imports since 2002
Same in Norway
Lada was the punch line in all of the "bad car" jokes in the 80's and 90's.
A few can still be seen on the roads now and then, but they aren't exactly common
In Norway the importer, Konela, gave you lots of options such as sunroofs and even bodykits
They even sold a tiny amount of performance versions with turbos
From my understanding these were actually really good (considering it's a Lada), and on par with the Golf 3
Never droven one myself, but would love to
I still see some from time to time
True that
I doubt they sold really any at all outside of the Nordics
A old norwegian guy had spent a little too mutch time traveling and tried to hagger the price of a plant in the flower shop I worked in
I told him no, in norway its disrespectfull to try to hagger for a lover price in stores he was norwegian so he knew better
"But in other countrys is commen to hagger the price down
"Well, thats not how we do it in norway
Then he proceded to say "I can get if for half the price in the food store"
Me; "then go buy it from the food store
But don’t come and ask for adwice when the plant die after 2 weeks/have rot/pests
There is a reason a Flower shop is more expensive just like there is a reason the baker have more expencive bread than the regular food store
My boss thought the customer was rude and as she said "he always create problems when he come, haggering the price, spend 30 -45 min of our time and then don’t buy anything etc" both my boss and coworkers thought my response was funny, as we had to deal with him often
You could forgive a foreigner for not knowing the shop dynamic in Norway, but a native norwegian
Comon, its not that hard
In Norway we have seatbelts in the bus as well
But alot of people dont bother to use it even though they could get 500 dollar fines for not using a seatbelt
I had no idea Italians don't like wearing seat belts
Do more ppl die in traffic there I wonder
Your friend should have taken better care of you
Told you to come all the way in, keep your shoes on and so on
Their bad, not yours
Not taking off shoes would be a big no-no in Norway
I wish every mechanic was like that
Probably more fun work for them, and my car would become more unique for each repair
Now I am confused
Is light-beer a low calorie beer, a low alcohol beer or light in colour, like a pilsner
In Norway a light beer would be non-alcoholic and a lite beer low calorie
A pilsner is
beer
When do people normally go to bed
(And when do children go to bed
you don't do pre-parties before going out
I know
Very surprising that other countries don't see the need for it
To add to that: even when we say don't worry about wearing shoes on inside, always ask "Are you sure
" might be a politeness thing not to inconvenience the person
Don't you get fines for not wearing them
Like this in Norway too and I am almost completely sure it's the same in Sweden
No wonder why you are so healthy down there
You go hours between meals
But when do your kids sleep
Here people put the kids to bed between 19-21ish depending on their age
Agree, even though going out is cheap enough (I lived in poland for 6 months and it doesnt get cheaper than that), its still nice to be at someone’s place before going out
This is true
Ah ok
I understand
Maybe he's one of the spanish people from a reply further up, and dinner time to him is 21:30
Dinner is whenever you eat dinner, you act like your way of doing it is like some holy unbreakable rule lol
Most are when you think about it
Most are about killing, wolfs and trolls eating children, and so on
The exception might be about Per, Pål and Askeladden all trying to get the princess and other stories like that
Yeah pretty much all of the old adventures are horrible
We have our own version of Grimm brothers, Asbjørnsen and Moe
Lots of children getting eaten or burned
The most common punishment the king would inflict on advenutrers that fail in their quests would be a branding iron or having the skin on their backs peeled of and rubbed with salt
Lots of little girls getting abducted by trolls or giant beasts to be their wives
Here in Norway we have several stories about trolls involving gore and  murder
The one story I remember best is where a little boy is having an  eating competition with a big troll, and he convinces the troll to cut  open his stomach so he can eat more than the boy
This of course kills  the troll, and the boy then steals the dead troll's treasure
I remember having a nightmare as a kid where a troll kidnapped me to her underground laboratory to chop of my arms with a chainsaw, because she was using human limbs and body parts on her robots to make them better
Maybe some of the troll stories scared me more than I remember
Askeladden som kappåt med trollet is a bit nasty tho
About Askeladden, or Ashlad as he's called in the english translations, had an eating competition with a troll
He put his backpack on in front as trolls have poor eyesight, and filled the backpack with most of the porridge
When the backpack was full, he took out his knife and sliced the backpack open so the porridge poured out
Then he said "there, now I can eat as much as I want without feeling full
" the troll then thought he had actually sliced his stomach open and asked "does that really work
" to which Ashlad said "of course
Why dont you try it yourself
".. The troll didnt want to lose the competition, so he took his knife and cut his guts open, bled out and died
Then Ashlad was able to take all the riches he wanted and lived happily ever after
There are some local stories about the underwordly, vetter and Huldra
One story we were told as kids was about a girl who was kidnapped by Huldra while her parents were in church
To get her back they had to drag the freaking church bell into the mountain and chime
The end of the story is that it didn't help
One night she visited her grandma and told her she would have been released it they had chimed just once more, but she has to go to the underworld forever now
Lille Hoa Hottentott would like a word
Haha this is the exact version I was read to when I was a child
And that's the only time I heard the story where Rapunzel had a Norwegian translated name: Kjørvel (it's a cool word, but not as a name, so I understand why it didn't last)
I forgot about that one
I do remember thoroughly enjoying the story as a kid though
Never heard that one
It was oddly one of my favorite Askeladden stories when I was a kid
My parents have a big collection of all the Per, Pål og Espen Askeladd stories
And all the Grimm stories, all the H.C Andersen
Uhm, just about every collection of old myths, fairytales and stories there is to find in this part of the world
I never lacked reading materials
I think it's local to my hometown, or area
US way of using 'Liberals' and 'Conservatives' makes little sense in Europe
They also use opposite colours (left is blue and right is red), which adds to the confusion
"Shame". Can (in South Africa) be used about anything cute, sad, nice, bad
Very confusing for the rest of us
(However my South African husband never uses it much, but his sister in law on the other hand
Every other sentence
He says cheers a lot though
But only when speaking English
Edit: I forgot - "I'm coming now" which never, ever, means that you are coming now
[Ever
In Norway we tend to view the left as being conservative *("averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values")*, and the right as more liberal *("willing to respect or accept behaviour or opinions different from one's own; open to new ideas")
How did a South African end up in Finland
If I may ask
:) I would think some would avoid it due to language
(I love Finland personally, but also find the language beyond difficult)
Especially when "just now" turns out to be more than half an hour
> Finland is amazing for quality of life
Yes, one of the best in the world
And Finns make great friends ones you get to know them
Happy you were able to escape
And sad that South Africa seem to go downhill
I hope things will eventually turn for the better
Thought so, then I moved and realized it's just me
I used to think that way
Then I travelled around and spent some time abroad and I come to the realisation that I was Norwegian through and through and come to appreciate many aspects of "Norwegian way of life".
I think this is somewhat common for people moving to the Nordic
We are not exactly the most including kind of people
I recently saw a documentary about an African guy who runs a successful hair salon somewhere in Denmark
He felt that no matter how successful he became, people would still just assume he sold drugs for a living because of him driving a really nice car
I believe his experience would have been similar if he lived in Norway
Racism here is somewhat subtle, but still very much present
Casual drinking during the week (ie: a little something in your glass for dinner, a relaxing beer after a long day at work) is blasphemous (THINK OF THE CHILDREN
), and don't even get started on drinking during the holidays (there's a whole ad campaign throughout December imploring parents to think of their wee little ones)
*But*.....
Weekends are fair game
At the start of the evening, you'll usually hang at some mates house slugging beer and singing Tore Tang very loudly and badly
And at the end of the night you'll often find yourself at some random strangers house for an after party, again singing Tore Tang very loudly and badly
And as for the middle bit, as alcohol is so expensive, if you're going to invest on getting a buzz, you might as well get paralitic (also, that way you can work up the nerve to take home Karin from accounting home for a shag
If that goes well, *maybe* you'll work up the nerve to ask her out)
And I mean, fucking paralitic
That straight laced colleague of yours is *for sure* necking a pint of overpriced wine at 7am at the airport while waiting for her flight to Alicante
I mean, shes on holiday after all
During the summer holidays it is permitted to enjoy alcohol in a normal manner (ie, something in the glass for dinner, a relaxing beer after anlong day)
Its summer, so fuck the kids
And that's how it goes, week in, week out
At least here in the bible belt of Norway
You either don't drink or you get drunk
The notion that you can have a glass of wine with dinner and that is it, is a rather new thing up here
And some don't drink at all - as in never
Which I guess is a kind of reaction to the binge drinking
Some would say its because they are Christian believers
But we all know Jesus drank wine
And he even frequently hung out with ordinary people in the pub
There is a saying coming from south of Stavanger: "We know Jesus drank alcohol, but that doesn't mean we need to like it
Norway, a land where alcohol was prohibited for a while, and since has been frowned upon
Pietistic religion has been seen as a good reason for being anti alcoholic
Being visibly tipsy is also seen as a bad thing by some
We have not had a real culture around alcohol as a normal thing to drink at a meal or recreationally in the evening, but there's a huge culture based around drinking your brains (and guts) out in the weekends
It’s not looked down upon by the majority and it’s pretty normal to get drunk now and then
Pretty sure snaps is a Danish thing
More common among young people, yes, but if it wasn't for covid I could definitively gather a group of friends to get properly drunk if I wished to
Norway genuinely has such an unhealthy binge drinking culture
This is probably not representative for Poland as a whole, but I visited Katowice some years back and was surprised how drunk people were
I thought Norway had a hardcore drinking culture
But here, people were sleeping on the tables, stumbling around
I was also surprised how relaxed the bouncers were
Also a lot of people were on MDMA
You got a point
Italians have no reason to become drunk every weekend
So all Nordics just like our beer then
And sometimes our shots/drinks
Sometimes our wine
And only very occasionally our snaps
In Scandinavian languages the word is "snaps". Akevitt/aquavit is the most common one here, but there are others
Yeah I had a great time in Poland for sure
Underrated travel destination
Amusingly, "eau-de-vie" and "akevitt" have the same origin
Aqua vitae, the water of life
Hand disinfectant is under "drinks", clearly
And cider is basically wine
Poverty
Norway was a pretty poor country until someone found oil offshore and the government decided that we should share the profits in a national pension fund
Now there are very few actual poor people, those who are, have probably fallen between chairs in our great social welfare system
That is so interesting
When did they stop doing this
The opposite Norway, here we have signs that says that drivers should watch out for the children playing
I don't know, I don't pay much attention to that discussion
The welfare fund is pretty damn I don't plan on living much more than 40 more years, so I believe I'm set for life
Per today the fund is valued at 11,000 billion Norwegian Kroner (1280 billion USD) and growing
Why
If you know
My children had skiing day at school last week
They were thrilled
Last year we had no snow, so it was 2 years since last time
So all the skis and shoes from then had become too small
But in 2019 Norway started "sporting gear libraries" in many towns ("BUA")
So this year for the first time we could borrow everything they needed from there
The kids had lots of fun
Seems like the snow is staying for a bit so we might go skiing in the weekend as well
Well, they are iconic
So in a way I get it
Ah ok
I had no idea there was a difference
Well, this is only 1,5 years old here
So the trend might spread to other countries
It's a great way to try out a sport to see if you like it
Or for children who constantly grow and need a different size
Lots of people waiting in line when we were there last - my guess is that lots of schools do skiing day now while the snow is here
As a general rule, Billboards along roads are **not legal in Norway**, unless it's  part of the building it advertises (like a gas station sign)
No, we have the freedom _from_ this type of shit
Real freedom
I don't mean to criticise Christians as a group, but it's kind of typical of a certain kind of Christians to put up a billboard asserting that there's evidence for the existence of God, instead of presenting the actual evidence
Over here we just nail our religious opinions to church doors and spark religious reform revolutions
Being Jewish
Never had to worry
Just have to laugh at the thought of people praising Jesus
I think billboards are unusual
At least as stand-alone things along the high-way
There are ads on walls, etc, though
But I have never seen one with a religious message on
That is really not pretty
It is our road safety law which makes these billboards illegal
The reason is that they are distracting
Juxtaposed with those beautiful mountains that looks downright dystopian
Haha
We still have ads on pedestrian areas, but exploitative, discriminating and offensive ads are illegal
Danish, Swedish, Faroese and Icelandic
In that order where Danish is the easiest to read and Icelandic the most difficult
[Potato language]
Danish
It's written almost exactly the same as norwegian, but it sounds like someone threw up in a lexicon and made it a language
Danish is very easy to read beacuse our writing is extremly simmilar, if you are reading Danish without knowing it might actually take some time before you realise it
But it’s impossible to understand what they are saying most of the time
Swedish is pretty balanced between writing and speaking it
We can read it pretty well (not as good as Danish) but we understand and can speak it much better than we can with Danish
Danish and sweedish I suppose
Danish is almost indentical to written norwegian bokmål and sweedish is simelar enough to be understandeble, plus we grew up with sweedish kids shows
When I studied language history in uni, I read that apart from Swedish and Danish, Dutch is actually the easiest language to learn for us Norwegians
A lot of words are only used in Dutch and Norwegian, like rar(NO) / raar (NL)
Both countries are small and have relatively little cultural exchange with each other in modern times, so I guess that’s common knowledge only to linguists nowadays
You dont understand Norwegian and Swedish when it's spoken
Well you speak english
Try listening to the Scots language
It's as close to English as Swedish is to Norwegian I'd say
Written Danish and written Norwegian are basically the same language
Danish is just a lot more conservative and has the world’s weirdest comma placements
Not nynorsk
They are in fact very similar
Especially Norwegian and Danish
Yeah, they are very close
We’re both coastal nations that once had a huge fleet
That’s probably why
I previously worked for EVRY (now TietoEvry) and when we started that had this program for all new employees just out of university from Norway and Sweden
I remember the Swedes not being able to understand us, but we understood them without that much difficulty
Probably because we grew up watching Emil, Pippi and Saltkråkan etc
Yep
They make no sense what so ever
I want to write something sarcastic about having two systems, but we’ve got two written languages ffs
Norwegian rules are pretty similar to English
In Norwegian we separate between helsetning and leddsetning
If you combine the two without a period, you’ll use comma
That’s the general rule
The rule most people use, which in most cases are correct, is that you put a comma where there is a natural pause
«Jens likte ikke grovbrød KOMMA men han elsket loff»
"lieu" most likely derives from *locus
*  In Italian the equivalent would be "luogo". Kinda surprised you didn't catch it
Yeah, I don't speak bokmål (nobody does, it's a written language, but I get your point)
My dialect is from the west coast
This makes it harder for Swedes to understand, but most Swedes who has been a little bit exposed to Norwegian can understand me
Skiing
You wouldn't think that because of global warming, but Norway haven't had so much snow in 60 years as this year
Stryn summer ski center had to delay the opening until 5th of june due to heavy snowfall with 1 meter of snow this weekend
I remember not 2 weeks into my stay in Hungary my landlord was at the door with 6L of homemade wine in naturaqua bottles
I was skeptical at first, but man it tasted great
If you go north from Germany and end up with bad bread you stopped too soon
I should've been Spanish
Then I could also attend Barcelona matches weekly
> but Norway haven't had so much snow in 60 years as this year
Depends on where in Norway you live though
No skiing down here this winter
(Kristiansand)
we had like two days of snow in Fredrikstad this year
ey Fredrikstad gang
Gas station bacon-wrapped hot dog filled with cheese, standard roadtrip food
Nothing else really comes to mind
Frozen Pizza
Oh yes, a [baconpølse] can be delicious
But don't forget our [baked potatoes] It's the toppings that make it great, with sour cream, garlic and herb butter, corn, bacon/ham and shredded cheese
And some people treat [boller] almost as a fast food
Also waffles
(vaffler) Might I even venture to say fleskepannekaker
(bacon pancakes)
Plus we can't really deny our late night kebabs when we go out drinking
edit
also brunost på knekkebrød. (brown cheese on dried bread
Damn this reminded me of that it's way too long since I last had baked potato, maybe have to make some for the weekend
Everyone in Norway have flags, and wave it every year
Take a look at [this] Google image search
This is how all of norway looks like every year at May 17 (except this year and during WWII)
It's actually uncommon to not own a flag in Norway
Everyone owns at least one flag
To me, Constitution day (our national day) is one of the prettiest and happiest days of the year, and the flags really add to it
Here's a picture from the celebrations in Oslo:
Don't you flag for public holidays
Hold on, I think I can translate it to Norwegian: Vimpel
Yes, I thought that was everywhere
Here, that's kind of what flags are for: a sort of party decoration
We use it for private celebrations too, like birthdays
Edit: And boats, for some reason
My man we have [a whole holiday] specifically for flagging
Understandable
I hope that taint will subside though; you have a lot to be proud of too
Why do you sing "Happy Birthday" - to remind people to be happy
Like singing, flying a flag is a way to mark a special occasion
All countries do it, here private citizens do it as well
Regarding immigrants, I think it makes more sense to fly the flag of the country you've actively chosen to live in
But that's up to them, of course
I don't see many foreign flags though
You're not born with any ownership of your culture, but you gain it as you get older and more immersed in it
I assume you know more than I do about German literature, and history, philosophy, etc
Then that belongs to you, and that's something to be proud of
You can learn those things without being born in Germany, of course, and that wouldn't make any difference
If an immigrant is proud to be German, that's just as it should be
But it's probably not so easy to pick up a culture without living in it
You don't necessarily have to *feel* ownership anyway, in some ways your culture just shapes you whether you want it to or not
To some extent, your culture is part of you
It's not really about achievements, but the qualities that are incorporated in your own personality because you've been raised in Germany
Literature, philosophy, etc
changes you, mostly for the better
And less obvious traits of your culture change you too
And yes, those who grew up in DDR probably are a little different from you
But we're all much more than just our cultures, of course
Has to be [the king taking the tram during the oil crisis in 1973]
[This comes to mind]
It's in the immediate aftermath of the bomb that hit the government building 22nd of July 2011
[This is from Utøya a few hours later] where the terror attack continued after the bomb went off
> My personal favorite is a collection of photos by Bruno Barbey that shows Poland during the 80s.
Love these photos
Thanks for sharing
For context: he was going cross-country skiing in the woodlands outside Oslo, as he often did during winter
Normally he would be driven by chauffeur to wherever the tracks start, but during the oil crisis this seemed unsolidaric with the common people who were restricted from driving their own cars, so he took public transport on this one occasion
He also had a single bodyguard attending him, but this person wound up outside the photo
There is a reason why he got called The People’s King
I few years ago I was on the same flight as the Queen of Norway
And once I bumped into the crown princess while she was shopping in Kristiansand
Security guards in toll of course, but nice to see them do the same things as us commoners
Was expecting Churchill doing the V-sign, honestly
The one showing the ticket is Olav V, the current king's father
Yep
She sat down there without realizing it was the king already sitting there
He was such a nice King
They say that on Christmas eve, he personally walked out to the guards on duty and poured them a glass of cognac and gave them a cigar because he thought everyone should have some hygge that night
Sorry to ruin the fun, but she apparently hated how famous it got
She killed herself a few years after
Although I suppose the photo wasn't the only reason
They're all called Haakon, Harald, Olav, Magnus or Sverre
Still waiting for one to be named Odin
No Norwegian kings have been named Håkon
There have been 7 (soon to be eight) named Haakon though
Fun
Looks like a lot of traffic though
Anyone planning to take that photo, should have to do it early in the morning mid summer
Preferably on a holiday
Sure we have
We've only had one Haakon
Then a bunch named *Hákon* or similar in Old and Middle Norwegian
"Håkon" if you modernise
>In my case it's the absurd prices of mobile data
Haha same here
249kr (~25 euro) a month for 5 GB data
Houses are really expensive if you want to live within a reasonable distance from any city centre
Also, any decent meat is very expensive and the general selection of ingredients is pretty poor
Probably the cost of living
Admittedly, wages are high in Norway, but we have a lot of taxation on specific items, like alcohol, tobacco, petrol and cars
Luckily, I don't smoke, drink or own a car, but I still find some of the taxation to be too high
This was somewhat pain free for my children
My eldest already had a chrome book from school, and was used to the technology
So he could help show the younger sibling how to do it
The younger one could have borrowed a laptop from school, but they were able to use their Samsung pad, which we could attach a keyboard to
They both quickly learned how to do online meetings with the teacher and class, and share all documents back and forth to and from the teacher
So I would say all in all the transition to home schooling was quite pain free both for teachers, parents and school children
So the biggest challenge was really that I as a parent had to quickly become a part time teacher
But after the first week I started to enjoy it
>  I’m already having anxiety for how to solve this
Rent for a while
This is pretty true for getting a job here too, at least part time/low skill jobs
I applied for so many jobs as a teenager and I have had exactly *one* job, which i got through a friend
Is it snobbery or is it because you have more of a class system that makes the upper class or the rich/wannabes dickish
That is the one thing that feels a bit strange to me as a Norwegian when I am in London
It makes me uncomfortable being called sir by a person working at a hotel, restaurant or shop etc
Because then as a Norwegian I feel I have to be formal too and call them sir
Because I grew up in a society with no classes, I am no more "sir" than the person saying sir
It just makes the situation awkward
The UK do have the opposite of snobbery though
At a corner shop or pub, an older woman serving you might say "There you go, luv". How beautiful is that
That is a surprise
In all the photos of the Netherlands there are never a single candy wrapping laying around
Snus also is crazy expensive in Canada from what I read at r/snus
What is the average pay for a Canadian worker, if I may ask
That sounds luxurious
> The huge problem here is that getting a first hand contract in for example Stockholm takes years, or in worst case even decades
I had no idea
Maybe you need to apply for a job in Oslo
Rent is high
But so are salaries
Thank you for replying, those numbers are quite good imo
It is higher here but then again we pay 25% tax on almost anything, after a 36% income tax deduction
Because it was huge news globally at the time
Everyone knew who he was, since he'd won the Nobel peace prize not long before
(Especially here in Norway, of course, because we're the ones who award the Nobel peace prize and obviously because of the Oslo Accords that preceded it, but this was all pretty well-known all across Europe)
Two of my grandmother's brothers were killed in WW2
The third brother felt so shameful that he wasn't able to keep his brothers safe that he went to the US after the war and worked for 10 years
His family never heard from him during this time, so they didn't know whether he was alive or not
Imagine the joy when he one day in 1955 stood outside his parents house
My grandmother talked about it often
But he had to deal with war trauma for the rest of his life
My one grandfather served in the army and was deployed to Germany after the war
His memories from his stay there was good though
My other grandfather was a sailor and his ship had to hide under some mountain sticking out to avoid being bombed
Growing up with these stories make the war not feel so far away
And let us never forget, and never repeat
I have German and American friends
Watching WW2 movies together is a bit akward
I'm just really glad most of our spat are resolved online now
It dosen't feel strange to me but it feels strange to my great grandfather who is still alive at the age of 97
He still feels a certain way about Germany to this very day because of what my great grandmother went through during WW2
She was the same age as my great grandfather
Her dad was killed after German soliders shot down his fishing boat
We still don't know why it happened
Her mom died in her sleep a few weeks after
My great grandmother was 16 and alone with 3 younger siblings to raise and a farm to take care off
Now in 2021 the island we live on have become the suburbs
Back in the day it was just farming land
Fantastic album
Really brings a knot to my stomach
Let's not do that again
Edit: While we don't have bullet holes around here, we do have the [DORA bunker] A good old submarine bunker with several meters thick concrete walls
After the war the locals really wanted to get rid of it, but there was no feasible way to do it safely
So since then it's been repurposed as a national archive, with historical records, medical records, huge server parks etc
There's also go-kart and bowling in there
Good day to you very very eastern Norwegian
Don't compare us to northern Germany
We use *favn*, fathom in English, to measure volume of firewood
2m x 2m x 0
6m, or 2
40m^3
Edit: fixed numbers
For quite some time "Mong" was used as an unofficial (and humorous) money unit in Norwegian news papers
One Mong equalled around 4 bn NOK, which was the first signaled budget overrun on the building of the Mongstad oil refinery (the overrun actually ended around 6 bn)
I think we had something special but I don’t remember what it was, maybe about mil/miles or something
Until the 18th century “alen” was a commonly used measurement
It was the length from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger
In earlier times it was about 50cm, but in the 15th/16th century it was changed to about 60cm
It is not used anymore, but Jan be found in the national anthem
We use _mil_ in Norway too
It's the most common way to give distances when you're driving
We do
Not used on signage, but otherwise longer distances are always given in _mil_.
The definition of a *favn* of firewood is 2m×2m×0
6m =2
4m^3
Traditionally it was a stack of wood one *favn* high, one *favn* wide with logs one *alen* (two Norwegian feet) long
Alternatively you can buy a *storfavn* (big fathom) witch is five normal favn, or 12m^3
Wood is also often sold in small sacks, 40 litres or 60 litres or in big sacks of 1000 litres
I strongly suspect that farmers still use favn when selling firewood just to confuse city dwellers
Not a sea person, but I think we do that too
"50 favner" depth rings a bell to me

Saving this thread and adding to my bucket list
Unlikely to find a better place to discover the lesser famous, but equally beautiful areas of Europe
Honourable mentions:
Grand place
Carcassonne
Venezia
Old town Edinburgh
Alhambra
Norwegian fjords
Old town Riga
Idstein
Valletta
6 sept to 31 Oct
That's really really fast for an airport that size
we have forests lmao
Not to get in to a pissing contest, but fjords aren't created equal and ours are slightly more impressive
You have us beat on the other stuff though
Glaciers are smaller, our only (I think
) volcano is more remote, and no black beaches afaik
Weve got glaciers too and our fjords are far superior
i dont know about black beaches though
I think most of our beaches are normal
Got his ass
I think the builders also forgot the year
How very un-german of them
by the power of google and math i’ve determined you do have forests, but they’re barely there
by google i found that roughly two percent of iceland is forested, with an area of 103 000 square kilometers that is 2000 square kilometers
that’s 500 smaller than moscow and 500 bigger than london
compared to the norwegian woods which cover roughly 37% of norway, with an area 385200 square kilometers gives 142500 square kilometers of forest
that is 1
38 Icelands worth of forest
wow, that’s at least two icelands
you’re taking this too seriously man
Our "old towns" (although we generally don't have proper old towns as you have in continental Europe) and wooden vernacular architecture
I used to think it looked bland and boring, but I come to realise it is actually quite unique, charming and very cosy
It's unfortunately quite poorly preserved though due to a combination of fires and poor planning decisions
Our language
I used to dislike having two written forms of Norwegian instead of just one
Now, I appreciate the freedom to choose, and that people get to use the written language closest to their dialect
It’s a lot better than being forced to write some sort of hybrid language that’s not close to any dialect
> aspic
We have that in Norway too, although we call it Kabaret
It's a proper old people dish here
You are of course welcome, but sadly as mentioned they aren't as preserved as I would wish
I think Bergen and Stavanger are probably the best large cities to see such areas, while the coast of Sørlandet got a number of quite well preserved smaller wooden towns
I can definitively see some resemblances, but I think even the North-east of the USA have a more defined street grid than many of our wooden district have, which gives them a rather different atmosphere
I'm talking about areas such as [this]
Well I think that's a stretch in the other direction again
I at least think Norwegians towns are generally uglier than its counterparts in western, central and southern Europe
While I think the old wooden areas work nicely, well preserved examples of it are sadly few and far between
Many towns are instead just sad grey parking lots with a tired mall and a bunch of prefabricated villas
I actually think the state of many our towns looks is one of the worst aspects of the country
One thing pretty much every place in Norway got going for it though is a scenic natural setting
One example that is typical of Norway: Ørsta, a [mess of a place] but with [beautiful surroundings]
I assume you are referring to my remarks about "old towns"?
On the continent you often have very well defined old towns with clear a border separating them from the modern city
A very good example of this is [Krakow] Defined Old towns like that are very rare in Norway
Instead we usually have smaller and larger pockets of older buildings here and there that are intercepted by more modern buildings
[This area] from Bergen is a good example of what I mean: It's a wooden district following what's probably a street pattern laid down in the middle ages, yet it is completely detached from the similar old districts elsewhere in the city by more modern 19th and 20th century planning
There are only two places I can think of in Norway where you have a old town district with defined borders and a distinct identity, and that is [Gamlebyen] in Fredrikstad and [Gamle Stavanger] in Stavanger
In both cases though we are talking about district that are located a little to side of where their modern city ended up being, which is probably why they have ended up being better preserved than other places in Norway
You mentioned being on time in your example
Just curious, where are you from
I really like Røros and the older parts of Trondheim too, but these are sadly not representative of your average Norwegian town
We have far more places that looks like a [variation of this]
While that is said there have been a focus on how poorly planned many of our urban areas are here and many are planning/constructing projects that will hopefully help matters somewhat (at least from my point of view)
I have never been outside of Dublin in your country, but I could imagine that
I also think it applies to the UK for most part
Interesting
If you're on mobile you can go to the front page of r/AskEurope and there should be three dots in the upper right corner
And from there I think you can choose flair
No problem
We don't really have a lot of fast food chains here except McDonalds and Burger King, so a KFC or something would be pretty good
Id like KFC, the chicken in Norway is too expensive for it to be profitable here so sadly not gonna arrived here any time soon
Wok to Walk
I think they're Dutch but I've eaten at several locations around Europe (Amsterdam, London and Riga, I think), and they make a pretty good fast food wok
So I'm a bit sad that it's not something I can find in my own country
I agree
And we need Dunkin' Donuts, Tacobell and In n' Out
In fact, if we get Dunkin', I'll give up my hope of keeping myself relatively slim and embrace my inner fatso
I did actually read a bit on why they're not here and there's two reasons why:
They have their own distribution-network where they produce their own chickens, and Norway have very strict laws on chickens, so if KFC where to buy Norwegian chicken it would be too expensive
We have usable working environment laws in Norway and wage requirements, it will be extremely expensive for a chain that needs very cheap labor
That's very true and I think a big reason for it is that it's expensive to eat out and that almost no one does so
There are plenty of places in Oslo and Bergen, but that's because those cities have a lot of citizens
Places like Setesdal doesn't have a large enough customer base to support a place like that
I know I'll be disappointed, I just want the opportunity to go there lol
Not at all
Plenty of people use different mailing services
We say mail or e-post
Never heard that before, no
«E-post» or «mail» is the most common thing to say
I've never heard anyone refer to it as gmail
I also find that a lot of people I interact with either use hotmail, yahoo or other domains, personal or providers, rather than Google's service
Might be because of habit, or just not wanting to go over to a completely new system for no reason
Anyway, most people just refer to it as "e-post" or "mail".
Here I hear people use email or just mail
It's only when necessary that gmail or any other is specified
'e-post' is still the common word in both Norwegians
Yes, most people I know is not even using gmail
Most people I know use gmail
I'm gen z, though, so that might have something to do with it
Yeah, probably
My children use gmail at school, so I guess they might stick with that later also
I've seen some good suggestions here, but for Norway I'd probably go with this order:
Denmark (the so-called 400-Year Night, as well as them giving us our constitution and royal family)
Sweden (union, wars and close neighborhood)
Germany (the Hanseatic Period is a big part of our history, which permanently affected our economy, society and language
And then the occupation in WW2 of course)
Iceland (some might disagree, but the first generations on Iceland were Norwegian and  is thus an important part of Norwegian, as well as Icelandic, history)
UK (long-time trading partner and ally, especially in WW2, as well as close ties to the royal family)
1 & 2
Denmark and Sweden
Both have their history so intertwined with ours
From the vikings, through the Kalmar union and into the consecutive unions, both our Scandi brothers are impossible not to mention when discussing Norway’s history
United Kingdom
Our biggest trading partner for years, most important ally in WW2 and in many ways the cataclyst into how we broke off the union with Denmark in 1814
Russia
I would also say Germany due to WW2, as they occupied us while the Russians liberated/invaded much of the north depending on how you view it
In general Russia more so than Germany due to the USSR’s influence on Norwegian politics
United States
Basically impossible to not mention them when discussing the history of the past 100 years
The US constitution was also an inspiration to the Norwegian one, so there is that
Sweden and Denmark definitely
Then : Iceland and Germany
Then probably UK
Denmark 2
Sweden 3
Iceland 4
Germany 5
England maybe
(WW2 and pillaging)
For Norway:
Sweden
Denmark
~~Finland~~ USA (Switched out Finland for USA)
Either Germany or Russia
&#x200B;
Edit: Come to think of it, I'd probably put Finland below Germany/Russia
Denmark (Kalmar union)
Sweden (Union with sweden, great northern war)
England (Viking age, early medieval ages, 1066)
Germany (German occupation 1940-1945, hanseatic league)
Kinda stuck on the last one, Iceland maybe
* Denmark
* Sweden
* Iceland
* Germany
* USA
Russia could have been #5 too since they liberated Norway from the Nazis and there was a pro communism wave after WWII, but I chose the US because of their cultural importance
Not only music and movies, but Americana in every way is huge in (rural) Norway
Denmark
Sweden
Germany
England
Iceland
For Iceland I'd say Denmark, Norway, England, the US, then maybe Germany
I would like to see it, because that will make other countries that are not part of the EU (us) look at that and go; "maybe we should do the same", because I am sick of seeing friends falling on hard times due to gambling habits that have a origin from places like CS:GO skin gambling and other places
And seeing younger people on our LAN parties spending obscene amounts of cash on loot boxes in games, especially in games like FIFA
Here in Norway I have heard talk from friends and family working in the gambling commission that it is in the talks, but it is moving at a snail's pace and probably won't go nowhere unless there is massive backlash to the concept of loot boxes
But I haven't asked in quite a while, so maybe it has changed
If anybody know any updates on that, then I would like to read/see it
I think so
I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy playing games made by studios that EA killed off
This would at least be for a much better reason
Colder
If climate change make us loose the the Gulf stream
Norway has another referendum regarding joining the EU
I read the same lol
And in that same time frame Europe went from Empires to being divided by the Iron Curtain
Was looking for this, things don’t seem very prosperous to say it the least
In the following 51 years there has been an enormous development in the technological/digital side of things
You have to take into account that Germany win the most, arguably, in the economy aspect of the union, hence you, as a German, don't really have to think much about the economic aspect
People who are getting fucked over in the economic aspect are to be expected to talk about it
I also identify myself as European, even-tho Norway is my current location
Honestly i hope Europe will go the federal path like the US, but I don't really believe it can happen, since that would require wealth redistribution
That's what I find quite strange, "no good reason to go"; I mean yea, sure I get it, insane costs, little to no clear benefit, sure, but at the same time we have 24 carat gold Rolls Royce cars being built, golden toilets, diamond butt-plugs, people building islands in the middle of the sea next to a shitty desert, and other things one would say "there is no good reason to build/buy that" - yet we have them
And yet we don't have "colony" on the moon
It's quite strange, as having moon colony would be the best propaganda tool ever for every country with "supremacist syndrome" (we have plenty of those) . But let's leave that aside
How about research - maybe we can research birth of life outside of earth - mice, monkeys, dogs, even humans
First human born outside of the Earth - how does that sound
We have theories about how those will go, but we don't really know much
Furthermore, currently when thinking of human settlements you think of the globe map and all the countries in there, just imagine having the fucking moon on the map with some settlements there as well -useless, yet complete game changer on how the human species sees itself in the universe
Currently we are species living on a rock in space; The leap to living on two rocks is much more grand than most things i can imagine, honestly
I am not some insane conspiracy theorist, but it is strange for me that we dont even have some permanent establishment on the moon like the ISS, but international moon station or something;
I work in predictive analytics and there are some super exciting things that are happening in the field and our capabilities are so much more than what they were even 10 years ago, and I am even more excited for what's to come
Space exploration is inherently much more exciting - yet lately I haven't been wow-ed
I was curious to what those languages are and google the last one - Aurignais
It ended up being the language of island of Alderney with present day population of 2000 people
Language died off with the last native speaker in 1940s.
Languages are born and die for reasons, and since the 2000 people speaking aurignais don't really see a point of speaking it - well maybe its time and purpose has come to an end
Or is it that you want my tax dollars to sponsor /**take steps to protect**/ a population equal to that of us redneck  trailer-park to speak their local dialect
That last one might come off a bit cynical, but for real - who cares about dying language spoken by a hundred people
«Raske briller», someone wearing sport glasses in a specific style often with multiple colors on the glass is a meme in Norway
Ngl the Danes have the best memes between all the Nordics
Don’t forget that we have replaced the drake meme
[Egon Olsen] random example from Google
For Norway it is Sweden
We have a lot of shared history, shared culture and we share a huge border together
Sweden is often referred to as "Søta bror" here, which translates to sweet brother (sounds quite weird in English)
It's also the country which always compare ourselves with
We see Denmark is very closely related too but they have a slightly more distant location
Brothers, Denmark and Sweden
Finland is like the quiet cousin thats always chill
Well, scandinavia is weird in that way
Norway, Sweden and Denmark is that one weird group of siblings where Norway and Denmark always make fun of Sweden
This probably depends on location
Someone more south or west in Norway would say Denmark, but someone more north and east would say Sweden
This is just a thought I had though, so not fact
A lot of us do
Some would claim it's Sweden though
Don't get me wrong Norwegians like Denmark, but we do love Sweden more
Eventhough they are our "svikefulle bror"
I haven't met many Lithuanians, but I found the Latvians much more cheerful than Estonians
Estonians are like like the Finns, quiet and gloomy (which being Norwegian I obviously dont mind)
Do Latvians feel the same way
How do you view Lithuanians in this regard
I might be in the minority but I feel Finland is our third, sort of weird brother/sister, besides Sweden and Denmark, but that's because I love Finland so much c:
(And we do share a border after all
Not Russia though, Russia is the scary neighbour with a scary garden shed)
How do Latvians view Estonians
Edit: sorry if that question offended anyone
It was meant as an honest question
Arent your language close'ish to Finish and Estonian
Do you feel related to them in any way at all
Now I feel guilty that I forget that you exist sometimes
Wish we could move you over here into the Nordic brotherhood
We are rather boring over here, but at least its peaceful
And although we bicker a lot, but we do care about each-other
Switzerland, the Iceland of the mainland
Oh I had no idea you felt lonely
Join the Nordic
Yes
For a Norwegian point of view you are very similar
Estonia is still a bit under the influence of recent history, but they never lost their Estonian way of being (which is very similar to Finish)
I personally felt very surprised as to how Nordic they are every time I've visited
And extremely different from Russians who have lived in Estonia for decades
So the Russians were never able to remove the Nordic personality in their culture
No, Denmark just kidnapped you from your real daddy Norway
Come back, my child
Am I the only Norwegian who feels closer to Sweden than Denamark
Dont forget our neighbor Finland, that Cousin that hangs around always a little sketchy and drunk but a nice fella anyways
True, I grew up close to the Swedish border and would still say Sweden, I’m not too much of a fan of all their political descisions and policies but I still feel they’re the ones I can relate the most with
Denmark is and feels farther away, but obviously we’re close with them too
Well, they're called "söta bror", I don't recall having a similar name for Denmark
I would say its both
Really depends on where you live
I would say the west and south coast is really well connected with denmark
Now I feel bad for Denmark
top ten saddest anime betrayals
> And then there's Sweden's cousins Norway and Denmark who never considered Finland a part of the family
We do
but we only tend to include Finland when we include Iceland into the family as well I guess
And since we include Finland we can just as well include Estonia
First time I hear about this
If you have managed to make a Finish friend you have made a friend for life
What are your view on Norwegians
Danes
> I feel that Norway and Sweden has way more in common by geography and climate than we have with Denmark
With winter sports, mountains, Right to roam-laws, and state monopoly stores for alcohol, Snus consumption and such
Denmark feels much more continental, like Germany and the Netherlands
I agree
I will also say that both Sweden and Norway have, at least in my impression, a much larger urban and rural divide than what Denmark have
On a serious note, what are the sentiments towards independence
And then the distant relative Russia that no one really notices but is always there creeping in the corner
We also call them "svenskefaen".
So the further south the more fun-loving
Interesting
Living in Norway I hardly know what that even means
But a country can be part of two (or more) groupings though
Norway belong to Scandinavia where Finland and Iceland will never be able to join
And we are part of the Nordic
In the same way Estonia will always be connected to both the Baltics and Finland
Oh ok I see
I thought they were more similar so you could at least understand some words
I guess the geography led the two langages to move so far apart from each other
The meme is obv sweden bad,  it also very much depends on where in the country you live as anything along the west coast really doesnt have a relationship with sweden
Sweden bad
Idk about Denmark
Depends who you would ask
Most Norwegians would probably say good or ok i think
> From a danish wiew, Sweden bad, Norway fine
> From a Swedish wiew, Denmark bad, Norway nice
> I don’t really know how it is from a norweigian wiew
The Norwegian view is that as long as we're not living together, you're all fine
Including the other Nordic countries, which I'd say we also feel quite strong kinship with
> Scandinavia are also my cousins, they're 4 siblings,
There are three countries in Scandinavia: Norway, Sweden and Denmark
Iceland and Finland are only Nordic
Together, they are the 5 Nordic countries
Well, we wont send any Vikings in long boats
I promise
Thats the only one i have seen
Norwegians binge drink
So your theory must be true
In Norway the sauna culture is still the same
Everyone is welcome in the sauna as long as they are naked
I think so
It's not that we want to remove Estonia from the Baltics, its just that we feel related to them as well, in the same way (although a bit less I guess) as Latvia and Lithuania
Yeah none of us can afford to drink wine on a Tuesday
Skandinaviske brødre, hvor er dere

Not sure if this is a regional thing or if it's done everywhere, but right after dinner guests will start making a lot of noise (foot stomping, clinking glass ect
) and won't stop until the newlyweds stand up on their chairs and kiss
Norway: This is a local tradition from the area I grew up in
Friends not invited to the wedding will prepare some entertainment, dress up in something funny, and pitch unannounced a bit late at the weeding party
There they will perform their prepared piece, and then they get cake
Haven't heard of this in any other part of Norway though
If the bride wears a traditional dress on her wedding day, she can rent a literal crown if she wants to
There are four types of "crowns", Brudelad (  Hat with onsown silver),Bruderull ( A roll that goes around the head and has silver ornaments ) Brudekrone and Small Brudekrone
Brudekrone (Bride's crown) were very popular in Europe during the 15th century (I think
) So I'm pretty sure some other countries also do this
I've heard of this
Southern Norway plus Oslo
On the mouth or on the cheek
We only kiss the bride on the cheek as far as I know
The [royal standard] since I think it looks pretty cool as fuck, and it is the standard most kings during the middle ages used as their standard on ships and fortresses
I’m also monarchist, so it’s good for me
Not excactly what you asked for but I think our cost of arms should look more like it looked before, now it looks like it drawn by a child before it actually looked like it was drawn by someone with experience
And also I like when coat of arms are on flags, so maybe I would add our coat of arms on the flag
Not really, I like thats it's simple and the colours are bice too
If I had to do something then maybe a slightly  darker shade of red
I'd kind of like to ditch the cross to be honest, but unsure what to have instead
Make it less christian
Make it a sun cross or something
2 extra legs then
I have allways wondered about why Swedes like that light blue and yellow
Not that our flag is so much better (but it is, obviously), but that blue looks weak
The old flag with the darker blue color looks a lot like the Norwegian blue
And better
Now that I think of it, there are 4 countries with blue in their flag in the Nordics and Sweden has the weakest blue, don't you
(Finland laughs, Iceland nods and Norway shouts Yes
That's the Brexturn flag
Your previous flag was awesome though
no, needs some blue too
[this shows the evolotion of the coat of arms
White is hardly a color
But not all countries can afford both red AND blue ;)
The Sovjet one
I love communist flags and the visuals in "motivational" posters etc
Helt otroligt hur mycket bättre det ser ut
Har de någonsin officiellt övervägt att byta tillbaka det
Red in the corners with white surrounding them
And now I'm craving chocolate, and I'm quarantined due to the current pandemic
Thanks a lot
Same in Norway
Amen brothers
Most people move out at 18-21 anyway so it's often not going to be an issue but I have heard of it happening yes
Usually it's people who are done studying and move home for a short while to just save up whilst the first year or two of them working
So if you work full time but live at your parents house it's probably common to atleast help out at home in some way
And that could include paying a little rent but I wouldn't say it's the norm
I moved home now under corona and I'm not paying anything but I help out with stuff that's needed
Like mowing the lawn or whatever
That's generally enough
When I was a student, I lived at home for two of the four years and I had a part time job
My mom had left my dad a few years earlier and she couldn't get a loan to buy anything so she was renting the apartment we lived in
I paid a small amount of money to her each month to help with her expenses
It was way less than if I were to rent somewhere myself, and since I had a part-time job + student loans it was only fair that I would help my mom
I've also hear of some parents charging rent from their young adult kids that are students, that are known to not have the best personal economy for the parent to then put those funds in a savings account for their kid
Pretty smart if you ask me
I’m currently living with my parents at 22 y.o to save money for an apartment
As long as I continue to work and study they are happy with it
I have never heard of anyone paying rent, but I think a lot of parents expect their kids to study, work, or improve their high school grades if they continue to stay at home after high school
If they're still kids, no
If they're in their mid 20s and have a full time job, then I wouldn't find it weird if they payed some form of rent if they still lived with their parents
Unless they're saving up to buy their own house, which many will do, and many parents will help their kids out by giving money or providing the bank as "surety" (dunno if that is the right word) so that their kids can get a loan
In Norway, if you own a house with an apartment floor, it is normal to charge your kids(over 18) rent if they are living in that apartment
In my case, I was living with my parents for free and have my own bedroom until I was 18
When I turned 18, I moved down to the basement apartment and they would charge me rent
Not as much as they would charge a stranger, but enough that I could experience what it's like paying for rent
I would occasionally still go upstairs and have dinner with them, but mostly I bought my own dinners from then and on
This taught me a lot about being independent
Second this
- Norway
Julius the chimpanzee is a strong contender, he’s not as famous now but back in the day, he was raised by humans (out of necessity) and has his own books, a theme song, plushies, tv show (iirc) and he now lives in the zoo in Kristiansand
We also have the whale Hvaldimir (a play on the Norwegian word for whale = hval, and the Russian name Vladimir)
He’s a white whale that one day in May 2019 suddenly appeared in northern Norway
He was wearing a harness with a GoPro camera thing on (the thing the camera goes on, not the camera itself), and the harness was marked with “St
Petersburg”. So naturally, we concluded he was a Russian spy whale
Russia says he’s not
Anyways, the whale is well trained and have been known to retrieve things people drop in the water, play with kayakers etc
He’s taken care of by the city he now lives in; he doesn’t seek out other whale company and the state makes sure he’s protected (as much as possible) and well fed
There was also Keiko, the whale from Free Willy who chose to spend his retirement in Norway
He's been dead for a while now though
We also have [Sir Nils Olav] though he lives in Edinburgh
Good one
Forgot about him
Yeah, but he wasn’t that much of a national pet
More like a fun curiosity
Fuck that Dane though lol
I've heard a lot of people describe Norwegian as melodic and "singing". Too bad my dialect is kind of the opposite
A Portoguese guide told us that we sounded like fish on land
I was talking Norwegian and my husband spoke Swedish back to me
Like it’s spoken backwards
Most languages have an accent that starts on a high tone and ends in a low
Most Norwegian dialects are opposite, so we start low and end high
Ive heard from many americans saying people who speak norwegian kinda sounds like they’re singing for some reason
cant hear it myself but then again, i am norwegian
Danish is like a person speaking Norwegian with a potato stuck in their throat
Which dialect is it
Northern
Yeah you're right, that's actually the term people use but I didn't remember it
I can think of a more German description
You know those square Ritter Sport chocolates
Their slogan is "Quadratisch
Praktisch
Gut
" ("Square, practical, good)
Only the Germans kan advertise a chocolate by how praktisch it is
Good chocolate, though
Most dialects outside the (south-)east aren't very sing-songy
It's just that easterners are very prominent in the media
Kristianstad is in Sweden
Kristiansand is in the south of Norway
The Kristiansand dialect can sound a bit like Danish
What you are referring to in your last paragraph is a real thing and is a major way to divide languages into two groups:
Spanish is a “syllable-timed language”, where every syllable is pronounced at approximately the same speed, while English is a “stress-timed language”,  which means that different syllables are pronounced at different speeds
That's OK, you're not the first
There's a rumor of some Italian soldiers going to Norway for a joint force exercise, who was told to meet up at the ferry terminal in Kristiansand
They couldn't find the terminal, and after some military grade Sherlocking, they realized that they were in Sweden
They missed the target by one country, 9 hours by car
Denmark, thank you for being a great peaceful neighbour in general
Even if your language is weird ;)
Also thank you Sweden, for the exact same reasons, even if you are a bit dense sometimes ;)
Thanks to the both of you for cheap alchohol, tobacco, candy, and foodstuff
Thanks Italy for giving me an addiction to your food;)
Russia/USSR
They liberated my Norway, but unlike the "liberation" of eastern europe, they actually went home once the dust had settled
UK - Thank you for all the amazing TV-shows, James May and Harry Potter
Ireland - Thank you for Father Ted and Chris O’Dowd
Finland - Thank you for the moomins and all the awesome metal bands, especially Nightwish
Iceland - Thank you for the Icelandic horses and Stefan Karl Stefansson
Sweden - Thank you for snus, IKEA, Astrid Lindgren and cheap food and alcohol
Denmark - Thank you for being you, I love everything about you
Thanks Russia for liberating the northernmost part of Norway during WW2
Not many people know this but some of the worst battles in the whole war took place in this hellish, freezing wilderness in Finnmark
14000 soldiers on both sides died
Must have been horrible for sure, and the human sacrifices they made had a big impact on the war
After the war, they ceded the territory back to Norway
It's not really well acknowledged and honored by the mainstream Norwegian society because they were Soviet, which in my opinion is sad
But the local population up north have a historical friendship with the Russian neighbors
Thank you Denmark and Sweden for making us feel wanted <3
Spain and Italy
Their food makes life worth living
Thanks for taking care of the culture and mythology
In my apartment I always lock the door
Not that it's necessary
In the 7 years I've lived here, I've only had one incident of someone trying to open the door, and as it was at night during the weekend and he tried using a key, it was definitely some drunk person on the wrong floor who thought it was his apartment
My parents live in a house in a smaller town, and they only lock the doors during the night
They've never had an attempted break-in in their 40+ years living there though
Nobody in my area even locks the door when they’re not at at home
We only lock them if we’re going away for a long time
I live in a rural area
Yes
I didn't when I lived in my family home, but then when I moved out into an apartment for the first time I started doing it
Mostly because I didn't know the neighbours
Now it's just a habit
Yes, but only because I have a toddler that might escape
Otherwise not
It's common for people in the city to lock the door, but not common on the countryside
My mum lives in a village where she knows everyone, and people that knows each other well wont even knock before entering
You just walk in and knock on the living room door and walk straight in to the living room
(You never wait for someone to say "Come in
") Everybody locks their door just before going to bed though
Yes, but only because i live in a low-income neighborhood
A lot of druggies and beggars around here that could easily dip their hands past the door to nick something while i'm sat in my room playing videogames not noticing anything
Trying to use a key, while making a lot of noise is definitely a drunk person
Next time, try opening the door - it will give them the fright of their life
Not in Norway, never heard about it until now
> Don't your front doors lock when they're being shut
Never heard of anyone having a door like that on the countryside
Only a thing in the city
> I live in a small village and we always have the keys hanging outside during the day,
My mum lives in a small village
Sometimes when I visit I just put a garden chair in front of the door when I pop out for a bit and my mum is also out
Not to deter people from breaking in, but to tell the neighbours that no one is at home, if they were to come by
Well, the front doors to apartment buildings etc
work like that, so it's not a crazy concept
But the doors to single apartments and houses aren't like that generally
You've never heard of smekklås? They're very common here in Bergen
This is why I have never understood the reasoning for this type of door
Sure, you end up double check if you locked the door once in a while
But every time you're just going outside the house to remember the keys
How do you do it with families, are all the kids and parents bringing their own key outside if they're just chilling in the yard
What if you don't, and everyone assumes the others have brought their key
Lol, just thinking about it makes me anxious
Djånn meid hiss oei tu a tævvern fru de dark fårrest, åonli tu faind dæt hi fårgått de månni
Don't really have a way to properly spell the various "th" sounds, so "d" and "f" will have to suffice
Also the "j" sound in "John" is pretty hard to spell out
Sjånn meid his vei tu æ tævern tru de dark fårest ånli tu faind aut dat hi fårgått de månni
Takeaways from this:
Most european languages are phonetical, whereas english is not, meaning that a letter most often only represents one sound regardless of where you find it
The most common is U rather than O in «to», followed by something like id, jd or yd rather than the de in «made». Also Hi instead of He and several rather than one sound representing the O in Out/Only, the a in «A» and the I in Find (most commonly Faind/fajnd)
Also worth noting is that J in most languages has the function of Y, whereas Y is a vowel similar to i, or somewhere between u and i. Therefore John needs to written as Djohn in most languages as John on it’s own would most likely read as yohn
I love this little game
This isn't the first time I've tried fitting English phonetics into Norwegian orthography
Anyways, here is my attempt: *"Jånn meid his oei tu æ tævern fru vø dark fårest, ånli tu faind æot væt hi fårgått vø månni
Jånn meid his vei tu a tævørn tru de dark fårest, åonli tu faind aot dætt hi fårgått de månni
Djånn meid his uei tu a tævern fru de dark fårest, ånli tu faind æot dat hi fårgått de månni
Norwegian:
Djånn meid hiss uei tu ey tavøn fru dhe dak fårrest, ånli tu faind aot dæt hi fårgått dhe måni
*Dsjånn mejd hiss vei tu æ tævvern tru de dark forrest, åonli tu faind aot dætt hi fårgott de monni
Quite similar in Norwegian
If I read the original sentence with an American accent, it would go as follows:
"Djan meyd hiss uei tu æ tæværrn fru det dark fårrest, åunli tu faind aut dat he fårgåt det månni".
Åonli, maybe
My version is as follows:
"Djan meyd hiss uei tu æ tæværrn fru det dark fårrest, åunli tu faind aut dat he fårgåt det månni".
"Djan" because I read the name with a (mental) American accent, same with "meyd". "Uei" or your "oei" are both fine IMO
I used "æ" instead of "a", maybe the accent thing again
"Det" instead of "de" because of precisely the "det/de" reading thing
Nice
Yeah, that's better
*Fuck-Thursday*.
It was recently uncovered that the Norwegian Police Academy has for years had a sketchy party culture with something they unofficially named Knulletorsdag, or Fuck-Thursday, among their students and instructors
People have been paying with sex for favours and better grades
So now everyone's going around making jokes and using the term in relation to Thursday
And as you can guess the police's social media accounts have really been getting hit lately, with people making memes, photoshops and videos about Fuck-Thursday
[Like this TikTok (gif link)
Yes, our police force has a damn TikTok account
Someone edited the video of a young female police officer pointing to text boxes which in reality explained why the police was on TikTok, to her instead pointing to boxes saying:
>Why is the Police on TikTok
> To
> Dismiss
> Your case
> We don't have time
> It's Fuck-Thursday️
Oh, and then there's the pandemic restrictions I guess
But we don't have time to think about that, cause Fuck-Thursday's approaching
> and whether or not the government will face a vote of no confidence
Why
Don't forget the US election
I feel like every time I turn on the TV or read the news there is something about Trump
Three more days now
It's the greatest gift to Norwegian meme culture since Helge Ingstad
This was on the news in Norway, and I’m so sorry for you
This is just horrible :(
Hopefully
I would love it if Biden became the president, just to have "normal" level of news from US
You would think
However, last election year here in Norway, Norwegian press had three times more articles about Trump than about Erna Solberg, our PM
And it wasn't even an election in the US that year
Yeah, I feel the same way
For science, NTNU, Trondheim
For economics, Handelshøyskolen, Bergen
Dunno about the other fields, Oslo probably excels at a lot of other things
For natural sciences: NTNU (Trondheim)
For everything else: UiO (Oslo) and maybe UiB (Bergen)
The University of Oslo maybe
I don't know
But all our universities are good quality, so I wouldn't have a problem sending my child to any of them
Oslo is top dog for medicine and law
But all the big universities (University of Oslo, University of Bergen, Norwegian University of Science and Technology) are generally well regarded
Friend of mine from Norway just got in
Would one say its like the Harvard of Europe
None
I find all of them interesting, and hope to visit all the ones I haven't visited yet
All European countries have interesting history, nice nature, and friendly people
Not to mention being able to try out the local food
Uninteresting, imo it's Sweden (mainly the northern part), mainly because it's similar to Norway, but the whole geography of Sweden is pretty booring, flat, flat, flat and lot's of forests
Its quite funny how it all changes when you go from Norway to Sweden up north, large mountains and deep valleys etc, then into Sweden and it's just like a large slope going down to the most booring area of water in existence
Good roads though
Romania
I know, I know, its the home of Dracula, but I honestly found it the most boring place in Europe I've visited
I dont know what it is about the place, but I just couldn't get into it
> I don't know but I always forget that Moldova exists
Moldova happens to be on the top of the list of European countries I would love to visit next
Been to Slovakia once
Loved Bratislava and Komarom/Komarno
Also the country-side
Would also like to hike in the Tatra mountains some day
I actually find that Denmark has a lot of cool history
Im Norwegian, but vacationed in Denmark more times than I can count, and have seen a lot of it
They have creepy sand-drowning lighthouses, they had a church that was falling into the ocean, that gave me nightmares for years, several really cool aquarium museums, really old viking settlement places where they re-enact life during the viking age that are historically accurate
There are some really cool museums showing the history of both Denmark, Scandinavia, H. C. Andersen's birth place is really cool, and nearby there is a museum with some really exciting exhibitions
København has a lot to offer for everyone
Outside of Ribe, is an island you can only drive through when there's low-tide
And the food
So much amazing food
Denmark has a lot to offer, especially if you roadtrip across the country
Whenever we've went, we've chosen a nice place to stay as our "base" and then we've driven around to check out new places we havent seen yet
There's not a lot of places left we havent seen
Every little city and town seems to have at least some old history to explore
I guess the interesting thing about Northern Sweden is the emptyness and amount of wilderness
You could probably hike for weeks there and see no one
But yeah I drive up north once a year usually and while driving through Sweden takes roughly the same time I usually opt for Norway because of more life, towns and interesting nature when driving up north
I can agree
I usually plan my vacations based on three categories:
Big cities
Beach/sun
Nature experiences
If youre not really looking for a nature experience, you can find more interesting travel destinations for cheaper elsewhere
Copenhagen is great, though
I feel like you go somewhere to experience something different, and except for nature, Norway's tourist industry doesnt have much to offer
It is a great place to live, but not a great place to travel if you are looking for anything else than scenery
But I dont really understand the Iceland part, from my understanding Iceland is the about the same price as Norway
And I would'nt really go to Iceland either for any other reason than scenery
I will say that myself
We have a lot of nature and it can be really nice but if you aren’t into that you will miss out on a lot and should honestly go somewhere else
..someone's feeling left out
No good food in Luxemburg
>I don't think Scandinavian countries are cool at all
Then you should try going there without a jacket
Yes absolutely
The most common travel destinations for norwegians, besides our neighbouring countries are hot southern european beach destinations
We travel in numbers to Spain, Greece, Italy, Croatia and France etc during the summer holiday
It's been a bad year if you haven't been to a warm place with a beach at least once
For most people
There are always exceptions
Not sure if rude is the right word, but asking someone if they are okay/all right  for no reason is weird*, and when it happens several times it, at least to me, is very uncomfortable (and maybe feels rude)
Thankfully because of the internet I have learned that apparently this is common and polite in some places, and that is why some people who come here might do this, I just wish I knew it earlier
*I have to add that I mean when there is nothing to suggest something might be wrong
When everything is fine and there is no reason to think the person is not ok, and yet they ask if you’re alright/ok
Where I live we only say “can you pass the salt
” or “can I get the salt
”. And then “thank you” when the other person passes it or when they are about to pass it
That’s why in English class we were taught that if we ever went to the US or UK we had to remember to say please or we would be considered rude
Apparently it was a very common mistake
Yes we might do that too if the person is sick, that’s why I wrote “for no reason”, maybe I should have specified
I’m talking about when there’s no reason to think something is wrong
From what I understand, and I might be wrong about this, it’s sort of like how people from certain countries (Like US I think
) ask “what’s up” or “how’s it going” without actually caring about the answer
Even if someone looks a little sick though, we don’t keep asking if they are ok if they have already answered once, but this also depends on how close the people are to each other
For example if a friend doesn’t look good, I might keep pushing
But for another student I hardly know, I would either not ask at all, or I would only ask once
In norwegian we would say
>Kan du sende saltet er du snill
Could you pass the salt are you kind
I don’t feel like that’s so common
I would say that the most common is just “can you pass the salt
” Alternatively “can I have the salt
”  or just reaching over and grabbing it yourself
We have corruption, but less than most
I don't know if we have corruption in the same sense that you'll find in eastern europe and elsewhere, but you definitively get the impression that political careers are just a stepping stone to lucrative jobs abroad in NGOs and the like
As far as I know, we aren\`t that corrupt, but we most definetly have many corrupt politicians
I\`m not that engaged in that area of Norwegian politics, so there might be more corruption than what I know of
We have some form of corruption in the northern regions, but for the most part, no
very little if any
there might be some *very* slight corruption in certain areas but nothing to actually care about
Un-corrupt enough that when a scandal does come up, it's usually something like "this politician got an exemption for a car salesperson to build a cabin 50 meters too close to the shoreline, in return for a really good deal on a BMW
".... but corrupt enough that this happens
That is really creepy
> but also very corrupt places
What do you mean
So sad :( That is an good example that too mutch power for the leaders is bad
> För example in Malmö, Sweden some parts have been heavily affected by gang crime and the police don't have the capacity to stop it anymore
How does that make Sweden more corrupt
I think he means socially corrupt ( as in the inability of the government to change the crime rate) instead of economically corrupt
Well there's also the Faroe Islands at 49k and Greenland at 56k if we count those
This sounds really awesome
Love it
The only downside with live classical music is those audience sounds on the background:
[Beautiful piano musi

You mean a tunnel to Scotland right
Since the only thing that isn’t ludicrously unrealistic I mean
Wait why does Malmö need a metro connection from Copenhagen when you have a train connection already
Yeah I the lack of freedom in Sweden (?)
Yeah no thanks I’d rather we not destroy the world’s climate (more than already I mean)
No Oslo stop
Anyways if we can just get a decent speed link from Oslo to Copenhagen without switching trains in Gothenburg I would be thrilled
If I could just get a decent high speed train link to Copenhagen from Oslo without having to change in Gothenburg I would be thrilled
uhm
we arent exactly in the eu
Cool
Surprising that a metro line would be that much quicker than the train but I guess it’s much more of a direct route with less stops so it makes sense I guess
Please, all I want is just what’s good for the world’s climate
*pumps more oil while no one is watching*
Well the guy I was responding to said he wanted a train from Bergen so don’t look at me
We do, but the government would rather spend them on ludicrously expensive highways thatto serve a couple of remote villages on the west coast
In Norway some say that the city of Bergen is not really a part of Norway
They have a distinct dialect, local traditions and are very proud to be from Bergen
Said by a person from Oslo it would be an attempt at a put down, but when people from Bergen hear it, they usually proudly agree :)
Not exactly, but there's a joke that Bergen is not in Norway
Such as "I'm not from Norway, I'm from Bergen". They have a different dialect and take enourmous pride in being from Bergen
We second that
Håkon, Harald, Olav, Sonja, Ingrid-Aleksandra, Emma Talula, Mette Marit, Mertha Louise, Merta, Margrete
I think thats about it
We have been occupied by sweeden and Denmark so our royal family only contains about 4 generation with the last one obviusly being the biggest one
I also included Sonja who is our queen, was not royal to start with, but married at the time out crown prince, now King Harald and Mette Marit (not royal to begin with) who is married to crown prince Håkon
I am not including the sweedish and danish royal familys because they were not ours, they belonged to our occupants
90% of our monarchs were named either Harald or Olav
Hopefully you'd have a kid after Ingrid Alexandra became queen, lol
What color the Christmas soda should have, red or brown
The brown ones are more traditional and taste better, but the red ones are more christmaslike
Furthermore, each color has several brands, all of which have regional ties to one or more cities
You should try to resolve this before the people of Northern Ireland get entrenched in two camps that resent each other for no good reason
We call it skalk
You should too, it even translates easily into German; Schalck
The Nutella
Fixed it for you
>The brown ones are more traditional and taste better
I will not tolerate this type of slander of the superior Christmas soda, smh
>The brown ones are more traditional and taste better
You, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar
We call it "sisten" (the last), or correctly "tikken" (i can't really translate it)
It's masculine in Norwegian, probably mostly because the definite suffix for feminine nouns is -a and "Nutellaa" doesn't work so well
The Norwegian word for rolls is rundstykke
So I suppose they say Rundstück somewhere in the Northern part
> Ründstück(lol)
That's what we call them and it's probably your fault
The soft k languages stand together against the evil Danish
Some even make champagne colored julebrus which tastes like Villa Farris or champagin soda
No thanx, it's all about the Sørlands for me
> Protestants keep it in a cupboard
Catholics on the counter
Must be a Irish thing
Every protestant I know keep it on the counter
Checks out, because cats are also psychopaths
It has to be added, when making it definite
The suffix is only used in the definite case, indefinite uses an article but no suffix
So for masculine it's "en Nutella", "Nutellaen", but for feminine it would be "ei Nutella", "Nutellaa", which doesn't really work
I actually don't think any feminine nouns end with -a in the definite, but I've never thought of that before now
Huh
Is this regional, or universally understood
There are 4,27% protestants in Ireland
Do they keep it on the counter as well
(The only way that makes sense if you ask me
Highly educational - and made me hungry
Thanks
> We keep it on the counter
The only sensible thing to do
You end up knowing so many celebrities, or knowing someone that is related to them
I just wonder, what do you guys think about your military
And what are the opportunities in it
i took a pic of my brother and the prime minister lol, she was doing something political idk in the street and anyone could talk to her
Platypus is beak animal (Nebbdyr)
Orca is fat chopper (Spekkhogger)
A lot of the german ones from the top comment apply to norwegian as well
I really like "sommerfugl" (butterfly)
It translated to "summer bird" :)
Racoon = Vaskebjørn (washing bear)
Hippo = Flodhest (flood horse)
Rhino = Neshorn (nose horn)
Hedgehog = Piggsvin (spike swine)
Sloth = Dovendyr (lazy animal)
Bat = Flaggermus (flutter mouse)
Squid is ink squirt (blekksprut)
Porcupine is spike pig (pinnsvin)
Hippopotamus is river horse (flodhest)
Viper is chop worm (hoggorm)
Turtle is shield toad (skilpadde)
Weasel is mound cat (røyskatt)
Butterfly is summer bird (sommerfugl)
Dragonfly is eye stinger (øyenstikker)
Manatee is sea cow (sjøku)
We say vaskebjørn, washing bear - absolutely nonsensical
Also, tadpole is bum troll (rumpetroll)
I mean, Despacito was also insanely overplayed here
But in terms of the music coming from Norway, I guess the closest would be [The Fox] by Ylvis or maybe [Raske briller] by Nicolay Ramm for a Norwegian speaking option
I would give that crown to [salsa Tequila ] as the text is technically in Spanish
Mmm, sommerkroppen is also up there with The Fox
While alot og other songs got traction om home parties etc, Sommerkroppen was played at a lot of festivals 2 years ago
And Fairytale by Alexander rybak
It was overused for a couple of years for shure
Even he got tierd by the song
As I wak wak wak wak wak wak wak a mikafon
No love for Boten Anna
That also fits, turns out we have quite a lot of semi viral, meme-able music
The Fox was clearly most viral as that actually became internationally viral
I keep coming back to the fact that we have a lot of this music
Like, TIX's entire library, Pinne for Landet, Fredag, freaking Haugenstua, even Fy faen was massive when it came out
We have a lot of this kind of music
EDIT: Obviously Haugenstua was released during COVID, but I'm fairly sure it would have been played at festivals this summer if it hadn't been for COVID
Also huge
If we're talking BIGGEST most known song from Norway (other than the Fox) that would have to be A-ha's Take On Me and just A-ha in general
I think most Norwegians have a love-hate relationship with Fairytale, lol
You're welcome
Who have you been blaming the Fox on
LOL
Pretty sure Faded is bigger than take on me
So true
Its probably the same with What dos the fox say as well :')
That just made me feel SO damn old
Anyway, I submit [Boten Anna] for Sweden
That just depends on what you deem as "virality", because in terms of internet meme-ness the Fox takes them all
The views on YouTube says it all
I think we forget how huge they were worldwide
Never heard of Faded
Fill me in, please
Edit: Ah, the Alan Walker song
Yes, that one was pretty big
But you definitely under estimate the hugeness of Take on me
It's been a flipping anthem for almost 30 years
With all sorts of bands covering it long after it went off the hit charts
In 20 years, probably nobody is going to do a cover of Alan Walker, I'm sorry to say
However big that song was for a period of time, it never reached the level of global hit-ness that Take
On Me has
That’s definitely true
I work with kids that love the Fox, so I’m more in the hate camp personally, lol
Ylvis have some great catchy, strange songs
The Fox is pretty damn annoying to be fair
Faded from alan walker
Looking at both spotify and youtube it has over a billion more streams in total
Although it is hard to say which of them has been heard the most thought
“Fade”, which is a NCS song from Alan walker and the one faded is based on got really popular
A saw a lot of people use it because no copyright
And the music industry has had a drastic shift since take on me came out in 1985 and now a lot of stuff is streamed
Same, it was fun in the beginning, but now i mostly dislike the song and love the music video :')
I still think Take on me is a bigger hit
I'm 40 now, and I bought the cassette as my first ever record when I was like 5 or 6
And I guess my then 30 year old parents must've known it, and probably half the older generation
And it hit globally, massively, when bands became true rock stars
Nowadays things hit the market very differently
Music consumers today don't go out and spend 150 kr on a CD, they stream a song or a playlist more or less unconsciously (compared to buying a CD)
Alan Walker is not, nor will he ever be, as hugely known as a-ha due to the way people consume music then VS now
And definitely not as big as Take On Me which is instantly recognized by most people under 70, down to teenagers/kids today
Norway has been working on national ID cards since 2007, they were supposed to be ready in 2013, but they have been delayed over and over and over and are still not here
The way we used to do ID here is we had photo ID at the back of our debit cards, but a few years ago many banks stopped doing this as it's expensive to produce and they expected the government to roll out national ID very soon
Thanks to this many people are now in a situation where they have no valid ID card except their giant passport that they have to lug around everywhere if they do not have a driving license, some also don't have passports and so do not have ID at all
They are reportedly rolling them out this fall, but I am not holding my breath
>**In 2007, it was estimated that providing new national ID cards to residents of Norway would cost 14 million kroner ($1
7 million, €1
5 million)
Today, the price tag has ballooned to over 700 million kroner ($86 million, €73 million)
This stupid ass [ship tunnell] A tunnell for boats, like a canal but under a mountain
To cross from one fjord to the next and avoid the open sea
Never been done before anywhere in the world
Probably for good reason
Estimated cost around 300 million euro
Let’s hope it never happens, the cost of corona should kill the project
There are others, too
Usually, the execution isn't all that bad, but the budget is often underestimated by a lot
* Our parliament (Stortinget) was supposed to renovate some adjacent offices they use on a 70 million NOK budget
Soon, more stuff got added on, most noticably a bomb proof delivery entrance
The final cost ended up being 2
3 billion NOK
* A diving platform was to be built on a beach in the city of Hamar in 2008 for 1
5 million
It was finished in 2014 for almost 26 million
* The Oslo Opera house had a budget of 750 million
It ended up costing 4
3 billion
* When the Oslo metro were to switch from paper to digital tickets in the early 2000s, development was slow and the entire project was replaced by another
The first project managed to spend 600 million on turnstiles which were never activated as intended
* There's tons of public IT spending which have gone to waste
It's impossible to keep track of all the failures, but we're talking tens of billions of NOK
I just don´t understand how hard it can be to produce some fucking IDs
It baffles me
My bank (DNB) still have picture ID on the back of the debit card they issue
It is quite an elegant solution, having the ID on somehting you have with you all the time
When travelling, it is always funny when you give them the card and they ask for ID, and you just tell them to look at the back of the Visa card :)
I HIGHLY recommend the podcast "how to fuck up an airport". It's in English, and debates all things that went wrong
My favorite is that they have to drive an empty airport express train regularly every to the airport to keep the track from going rusty or whatever
Even the train drivers find it funny to do that route,
The diving platform is my favorite
I wouldn't call Bybanen itself a badly executed project, but the extension to Åsane has definitely been a trainwreck
Not anymore
They changed it
Depending on when you got the driver license they last for 20-30 years
It's not just "some fucking IDs". There are lots of things that has to be in place before they can roll them out, like the IT part of it with chips can't be hacked and they should be close to impossible to pirate or fake
But yeah, they're long overdue
Not everyone has a driving license, I live in the middle of a major city and use public transport,  cars are expensive and heavily discouraged
They are yea
To be honest very few people doesn't own a passport and/or driver's license
Probably 97%+ of people own one or both but of course it's handy having something official that is primarly used for ID
Apparently they're figuring out every year that they're not secure enough and have to push them forwards
Seems strange though because rest of Europe has had functioning ID cards for a while now
Passports and driver's licenses are usually accepted as ID
In some cases it might only be passport
Where I'm from, you just take 500 kr in 2x4's and something to fix it to the ground
Of course it is not very straight forward
But two things: They have working on it for over a decade and just about every other country in Europe has ID cards
I would argue we are a pretty advanced country in most areas, so I really don´t understand how we can take this long
My mom has the early 1980's, huge laminated license, which would be valid until way in the future
She was stopped a couple of years ago, and the sweet police woman hadn't seen one of the laminates before
"But I can CLEARLY see that it's you in the picture, you haven't changed much in 35 years, so I'll just let you go on
Have a nice day madam
I haven't seen any stock piling from the grocery stores I frequent
But we are laughing a bit at those hording toilet paper
(Australians)
Only the face masks seem to be gone
People have panic bought masks and anti-bacterial wipes/gels/sprays etc
Personally I've bought some water containers for backup and have started buying my things that I use often, but 3 times
So instead of buying a 6-pack of beer, I buy an 18-pack
Coffee and toilet paper has always been stacked though
Not to prepare for a war or anything, we just drink a lot of coffee, and boyfriend got a shit load of TP since he saw it on sale and I happen to use it a lot
(Norway)
Shops are full and the all the toiletpaper is gone
We've had it for as long as I've lived, and after living in the US for a year I hate it
I never liked it before, but after, my gosh
There are already so many working on Sundays, why not let the stores be open as well
Skjønn is probably one of my favourite words in Norwegian
It means beautiful, but you can use it on things you find cute, nice, endearing, sweet and/or charming
Schemomedjamo means "to eat past the point of fullness because the food tastes so good
I feel so much Fernweh these days
I suppose the Norwegian version is "utferdstrang" btw, but that sounds more dramatic, like you want to leave forever and get a new life
I like bög cuz it’s what I’d think the swedish word for book is
jäg gillar bögar <— This boi’s clever
We say heimat, or heima for «being at home», in some Norwegian dialects, although those connotations are not something I recognize
Skjønn is also a feeling
It feels skjønt to take a dip in  the lake on a warm summer's day
In what language
Its considered kind of a «cheesy» word
Its probably best translated to «Adorable» which means roughly the same
Youll often find people describing babies or dogs as «Skjønn» or what they are doing is «skjønt».
Georgian, from googling it
I'm half-Indian, half-Norwegian
In Norway we have a female name called Randi, which means prostitute in Hindi
So that's weird
In India we have loads of weird names like Hardik
Which is also weird
Roger, sounds cool enough in English, but in Norweigan it's pronounced really flat and made fun of, like you're som hillbilly Truckdriver
I like it
>Old **slavic** names like Radomir, **Spiridon**, **Lukyan**, Svyatozar and so on
[Σπυρίδων] and [Lucianus] slavic names indeed
Brunhild is Russian too
I always saw that as a traditional Viking name
Svyatozar I agree on
The rest are fine
Always pick name foreigners have a slight chance pronouncing is my philosophy
Could you give some examples of these weird ones
> Hedda
That's a relatively common name here
That isn't the only thing he killed now is it
> Maicol, Braian, Gessica
And that's the spelling
Well, didn't Michael Jackson have a kid called Blanket
Mom came to work/study in Norway during a time when educated immigrants from India could come more easily in
Then the normal, girl meets guy, they fall in love, get kid etc
story
If I could have had a say though, I regret that she didn't choose the UK or warmer countries like Spain
While the standard of living here is excellent, it's different for one who is born and raised here
Most of us locals are soooo bloody sick of the shit weather and would like to leave
[It is a nice-sounding name] when pronounced properly
It sounds like Movicol, which is to help with constipation
My mistake
Meeting someone called Michael will never be the same after this
Cheese slicer and paper clips are probably the two most famous Norwegian ones
Actually in terms of "greatest" i’d say without a doubt artificial fertilizer
Without it the industrialization of the food industry would’ve been impossible
How the mighty fall
It's honestly surprising that the cheese slicer is not a global phenomenon despite its perfection
I would say fertilizer instead
For some reason most norwegians seems to think the paper clips are norwegian, when the’re actually american
Filling fuel in litres and converting it to mpg is so sad it's funny
The explosive whaling harpoon changed the world as well
Thank you for this
It's all we have
Please never talk to me or my country ever again
Pre-sliced cheese is expensive af
I pity that man
And the spray can and the gas turbine
And a common ticket system like airlines have
Imagining being able to purchase Oslo - Bergen, Barcelona - Madrid and Budapest - Lisbon on the same page
Imagine being able to purchase one ticket within Norway in the same ticket system with the same company
We can’t even do that anymore
Entur ;)
Hey hey hey, they don’t have a monopoly
You can always go to the airport and get into the tax free somehow to buy alcohol
It doesn’t work, they seem to only sell tickets for Vy
If you’re going with several companies you need several tickets and it often leads to higher prices, compared to before when it all was NSB
The conservative government has only created a train system producing more companies, more leaders, more multimillion class salaries, worse services and more hassle for the passengers, resulting in more car and plane traffic instead of by rail
Imagine if we could spend those money on improving the rail network instead, because that’s more necessary
Well, geographically you are not part of Scandinavia
Hm, I've used it for SJ Nord
But otherwise I agree
That's actually wrong
Scandinavia is, by definition, Norway, Sweden and Denmark
The geographic area that Denmark is not part of is the peninsula of Fennoscandia
The Scandinavian peninsula does not include DK
There is no "Scandinavian peninsula". The peninsula is called Fennoscandia
Scandinavia is Norway, Sweden and Denmark
We use the word Quisling on traitors
Beacuse a guy named Vidkun Quisling was the leader for for the facist party «Nasjonal Samling» during the war
And he betrayed Norway by cooperaring with the germans during the invasion and occupation of Norway
Kind of weird how people outside of Norway use the word Quisling, it is not commonly used here
WW2 is long gone, the feelings between nations are not affected by the war, at least not here
Life hack for travelling in France
Ask them if they speak your language and they'll be way happier about speaking English
Parlez-vous Norvégien
Non
Parlez vous anglais
No, thank god
Honestly when I'm in London I just assume people speak English and get right into it
Only i can think off are Conan exiles, Manual samuel and Among the sleep
Dreamfall probably
(And I guess I want to add the infamous The Secret World, that failed miserably)
That’s a far cry from every known game you have made
Listen only those makes it look like your gaming industry is going through a crysis
I would never have thought that those games are from Romania
I would never have thought that those games are from Romania
Ah yes, the floor above where they ~~commit genocide by throwing people in an oven and turning them into electricity~~ develop games
Isn't that
criminal
So we could legally serve her milkshakes with sugar isolated from semen
That's nasty
Looks interesting, but might be too creepy and scary for me
Unfortunally
I don't think anyone's critiquing the use of dubs when it's the only way one has to understand the medium
What's strange are those cultures where the norm is to dub everything all the time
Thanks Sweden for the cheap candy, alcohol and stuff in general
providing us with cheap food
and not passing us around like a bag of crisps anymore
I'd like to thank the swedes for cheap candy, alcohol and bacon
I'd like to thank the danish for having a funny language amd for having Lego Land so I don't have to travel a million lightyears
I would like to thank the ocean outside my house for being so full of oil, I live 10 hours from any neighbouring country and that's the way I like it
Just kidding thank you Sweden for our independence after 200 odd years
guess where I'm right now
stocking up the Pepsi Max storage
I second this
Things in Norway are so expensive it's depressing so I'm glad Sweden is just 1-2 hours away from where I live
Yep
A lot of people go to Systembolaget (state owned alcohol store) just to buy alcohol
However, people often combine the trip with buying large quantities of basically anything at the supermarkets
[Snus] is also a very popular thing to buy there because of the low prices
A 0
4L beer at a bar normally costs €10 and can often cost even more
It's very normal for a 0
4L beer to cost around €10 at a bar
It can get even more expensive some places
That's actually true for Norway as well, although we have higher taxes and fees than Swedes so our prices are generally higher
I've heard of Frenchmen coming here to purchase rare French wines because they're sold cheaper here than down there
Once you get to a certain price level (think thousands of euros) the fees and taxes can sometimes be outweighed by the sellers profit margin
Same applies in Karigasniemi and Nuorgam
Solo, the Norwegian Fanta, is some kind of national romantic drink
It just screams Norway
Urge (called Surge in many other countries, I believe) was much more popular here than anywhere else and is still in sale
The most popular one must be [Solo] soda, tastes miles better than Fanta imo
I think they did some aggressive marketing a few years ago abroad though
Apart from that some years ago (i dunno how it is now) Norway was the only country where [Surge] soda could be bought
It has been here since the mid 90's, since it was made here and known as Urge
I feel like a lot of Norwegian have forgotten about Tropo
A "tropical" soda that is really nice
In limited quantities
Urge which supposedly was a discontinued soda in america called Surge
Solo was the first thing I thought of
Would also say Villa and Mozell, though don't know if it's exclusively Norwegian
And then julebrus
And I guess Tøyen-cola
I hate myself for not liking Solo
I prefer Fanta
E. C. Dahl's Ingefærøl (ginger beer soda) is also amazing
Frukt is the champagne flavour from the local Tromsø brewery Mack, it's popular in the 3 northernmost counties
Hm, the most popular champagne sodas are Villa and Mozell, but I'm sure there have been many other variants, probably some of them chain-specific
That exact name doesn't ring a bell
Julebrus is a big one
Hamar Lillehammer rules ;)
I like Troika too
Many see it as an old person chocolate, never understood why :/
No worries, I hardly drink and sodas at all
But no brand all of Norway can agree on
Solo on the other hand
Are you sure you're Norwegian
I think Fanta tastes like sugar, and solo tastes like sweet sparkly oranges
And don't forget Fanta is a nazi-drink
Well
Not really, but kinda
Sorry
But civilisation was good while it lasted :)
I've changed my language settings to english because of this
Annoying as fuck
I haven't noticed anything
Maybe it's not available in Norway
Yes, I often can't actually tell what the video is about if I don't concentrate on reading the title in my own language
It has actually become a bit of a meme on the Norwegian subreddit
It started with someone posting an image of a poorly translated youtube title
It was written like really nice and polite in Norwegian so it's hard to get across how clunky it was
It was kinda like "The penguins of Madagascar may say the N word if they want
" and it has turned into this whole meme with people posting stuff like "jEg KoMmEr TiL å Si N oRdEt
Check out Sorted Food on your phone
I was so confused the first time I saw it
Immediately changed my settings
Even Mussolini’s granddaughter is a politician in a far right fascist party these days, and doesn’t even renounce her grandfather at all if I remember correctly
She even asked to be seated at his old seat at parliament
The most worrying part is that her party just keeps growing bigger and bigger
English
And while you probably didn't mean mobile games, they have a tendency to translate into Norwegian and it's just awful
Same with their adds and page in Google Play
It's obviously machine translated and looks bad and clumsy at best and makes zero sense at worst
Then again, play store won't even let me see reviews in languages other than my first language for some reason, despite it being spoken by few people thus few reviews, somehow thinking we are all too stupid to comprehend an English review or something
Sorry about the rant, but stupid things annoy me
English, because the game is often made in English, or the translation to English is better than the one in Norwegian
If the game was made with english in mind, I’d definitely prefer that
Other people have already pointed out how translations can be tacky and certain phrases and jokes does not translate well at all, but yeah that’s mostly my reason as well
Another reason is that norwegian dub voices are often cringy to listen to imo and they basically never fit the character
But then again, games with PEGI 16 and up are never translated to norwegian so I end up with english anyways
English
I think that is how I learned a lot of my English in the first place, and now it just seems a bit weird to me if the game is in Norwegian
I used to play the sims in Norwegian, but it was easier to just have it in English with my Tumblr blog
If a game automatically is in Norwegian and there's no reason for me to change it, I will play in Norwegian though
English
It just feels weird whenever they have translated things into Norwegian
I started off playing games in English, and have done so for decades
English pretty much always
Norwegian also often isn't available, I do play Football Manager quite a lot though which does offer Norwegian, but the translation isn't great so I tend to just stick to English
Given the game is good, original language is okay if english or norweigan, else english is preferable since translated words often feel reeeeaaally out of place
Exceptions is the 4th harry potter game, I loved that thing, and played it as a child in norweigan
Also the Sly trilogy, brings the nostalgia
That depends
When we got our independence the people living in the rural areas were the only ones who still spoke somewhat Norwegian
While cities had more of a Norwegian/Danish thing going on
Today "the farmer" is still something "typical Norwegian" but you might still get some shit for having an accent if you are from the rural areas of Norway
Tldr: Even though the farmer is "typical Norwegian", they are seen as backwards by some, but not a whole lot
(It is just banter)
You have Oslo and the rest of the country
Oslo thinks they rule the country while the country doesn’t like Oslo
Norwegian politics oversimplified
Haha, that's Trøndersk for you
I'm from Trøndelag, but even I might have some trouble with the more broader dialects of Trøndelag sometimes
But then again, as you mentioned, southern Norwegians seems to have trouble understanding the dialects around here more than anyone else
Something I actually have to consider at times when I'm talking to people from other regions
You: Jeg
The guy she tells you not to worry about: Æ
I speak English, Norwegian, and a little german
Never felt that it wasnt enough, it may be because I can understand Swedish which is the only other language than Norwegian and English I hear on a regular basis
I reappy wish I wasn't a lazy teenager back in high school
Had 5 years of german, and almost nothing to show for it
Sure, I can understand some sentences and probably make myself understood in simple conversation, but I realpy wish I had paid some attention amd tried learning it
Though, I don't know if I would use it enough for it not to be forgotten
I would also like to learn other languages like russian and arabic
I’m always curious to learn new languages, so it’s never enough
Probably helps that I dont travel much, I dont really need german, never use it
This is very common in Norway too !
We call them "snølykt" = snow lantern
Used to build them all the time as a kid
they are so pretty and fun to build
I did not know it was a thing in Finland too
that is pretty cool
I made lots of snow lanterns as a kid
Less chance of setting anything else on fire in the snow, so the adults lets us use matches without supervision
Ice lanterns however I didn't see until my children started making them at school
They put food colouring in the water to make them different colours
Yeah we used to build them a lot in kindergarten
The adults thought they were pretty and the kids would usually just help to build them
Now you can start a new tradition
The first part of the 2011 terror attack was an explosion against the main government building that left the area [looking like a warzone] Luckily it was after working hours in the middle of summer and only 8 people died
My heart goes out to Lebanon
Is that the ship whose anchor you can stumble upon hiking way up in the mountains
There is also the 1943 Filipstad explosion which ruined 400 buildings, killed 75 German soldiers and 45 Norwegians
That's not correct
His goal was to destroy the building which houses the Prime Ministers office (Høyblokka)
He did not succceed because he did not know about the underground tunnel under where he parked the car with the bomb
The building survived because It absorbed enough of the explosive force
Sweden: We love you just as much as Denmark, we just don't say it out loud as much
Finland: Europe would not be the same without you
You have a greater sense of humour than any country I know
Denmark: I miss visiting you in the summer
Best holiday destination in Europe if you have children
Iceland: You are mysterious and it feels like you are far, far away
And you have the most fascinating nature
Dear Russia
We know that one bad leader have put a lot of tension on your whole country, and we have treated you badly because of that
I really think that we could show better that we separate your population from your leader, and that we can have closer relations in the future
Sweden and Denmark, but no Norway
You’re not wrong
Not me, water is the best in my opinion
I love milk
If i wake up in the middle of the night, i take a glass of milk
It's difficult to imagine a life without milk
What else am I supposed to drink when eating bread
I drink approx
1 liter daily
I prefer the 1 % fat milk, called "lettmelk" or "light milk" here
It's the most sold variety
Yes, especially whole milk
Milk bars
hmm, perhaps a bit too Clockwork Orange for me
I don't drink that much milk, but there are some meals that taste best with a glass of milk on the side
I also drink milk when i eat snacks like chocolate
When im in southern europe i drink a lot more milk
For some reason i think it taste better there
The first time noticing this was in spain
It may have something to do with that we only have a few brands to choose from in Norway
Can not simply drink water when eating bread with cheese
I know Swedes are weird creatures but wtf man
There is this norwegian meal called "potetball" my grandma makes normally on thursdays and milk is the best option to drink on the side
By the way, I was in Tolo (Toyo) Greece for the third time in july and my favourite milk brand in greece is this one :
2011 and 2015, we stayed at hotel amaryllis each time
It's a long walking distance to the beach so i rented a moped :)
It rained a little this july, first time experiencing thunderstorms in greece
*Ut i Hutaheiti* \- "Out in Otaheite", an older designation for Tahiti
*Nord for folkeskikken* \- "north of common decency", in the sense that the place is both remote and "uncivilised".
In Norwegian you might use "gok". for example "langt ute I gok
Far out in gok
"Langt ute i Gokk" (Far away in Gokk)
I have no idea where Gokk is supposed to be, or where that word originated from
Langtvekkistan- translates to Far-off-istan
To refer to a place vague place very far away
>"Verweggistan", aka "Far-away-istan", is also a word sometimes used
Haha, we also say that in Norwegian: Langt-vekk-istan
I always thought it probably originated in a Donald Duck comic or something
Never heard "Nord for folkeskikken" before
"Gokk" is another word/name of middle of nowhere that came to mind
Der pepperen gror / where the spice is growing
Norway too
Dra dit pepperen gror:D
I was thinking Gokk or Langtvekkistan
Killing and eating whales
The Faroese and Japanese get way more flack than us
tbh if it's done humanely I don't see any reason why whales which are not of a threatened species should not be hunted like any other animal
But you have the coolest ship to cheer you up
HMS Dragon lookes incredible
Well, "facist" is still a popular word and Mussolini is the even shorter well known dictator from WW2, so you I say you still get your share
>Just name a thing Sweden gets either credit or flack for and it's most likely that also applies to Finland
Hot blond girls
The most beautiful in the Nordic countries are obviously Norwegians, but I have heard that Sweden send their ugly blondes to Finland
Might be a rumour
(It feels so wrong not to have Sweden being the butt of that joke
In Nordic banter, Sweden should be the butt of the joke
Obviously
Sorry Finland
Norway was not Danish territory in the viking age
That was a few hundred years later
As a Norwegian, I can say a lot of us gets pissed when people speak of Vikings as mainly Swedes, and a lot of what you just said also applies to Norway
When people get the Scandinavian countries mixed, Scandinavians gets pissed a lot of the times
I hope the taste was better than the visual image I have of that right now
> I think the Japanese blame is mostly because they often don’t eat them, just kill them in mass for sport
Where do they do that
"Damn Scots
They ruined Scotland
I thought making a fuzz about someone or a company not being PC when clearly making a joke was an American thing
US gets the flack for it, but Wales are there too I guess
This subreddit is about what countries get credit or flack for
So the question is why you thought this was something Switzerland should take credit for
I would belive Finland has the highest ratio of blondes
But the hot part
That said, I need to see a source to believe Baneken's claim
Because, according to statistics, half of the world's Finnish people are really bad at statistics
Yes, but is there reason to believe anyone pointing out they have a history of mistreating jewish people too was a camouflaged brag
"We were/are also racist especially in ww2 when we denied entrance for jewish refugees" does not sound like someone taking credit for anything
> I feel like a straight shot to the heart or brain and having the animal die instantly is more humane
The whales mostly do die instantly though
The harpoons are equipped with explosives to take out their hearts on impact
In the early 80's only 17 % of whales were registered to be dead within a minute, while more modern techniques have 80% die on impact, most others shortly after, and only 0,5% have to be shot twice
That's better numbers than the big game hunting that kills many more animals in Norway every year
I am sorry, I misunderstood you
I thought you meant it litterarily
> Turn it around: 20% of whales shot are in excruciating pain while being dragged by a harpoon for anywhere between 6 and 15 minutes until they finally die
(If we're going by the report your referring to, which only had a sample number of 50 whales which is not a statistically valid sample size)
1667 whales shot by the new grenades, vs 2106 whales shot by the old ones from what I can see, though I read a summary not the actual report
Probably not the same report either, since it mentions that of those 20% not killed instantly most were dead by 2 minutes, not 6 to 15
there is a law in Oslo that noone can build higher than this one particular building in the city center (I am not sure if Post Headquarters or Radisson Hotel, one of them
They stand in basically the same place )
For hide and seek: "Den som ikke har gjemt seg nå, må stå!" (Those who are not hiding now, will be standing \[implisit: here, in the next round\])
In Norway we don't say "ready or not, here I come", we say: Den som ikke har gjemt seg, den må stå. Which translates into: The one who hasn't hid must stand
Klar eller ikke, her kommer jeg
Are you gonna beat them with a shovel
Er d fortsatt noen i dette land som faktisk sier d å ikke bare roper d tallet de skulle telle til
I did see someone say "Barod neu ddim, mae'r helwr yn dod
Is that interchangable, or a dialect thing
Add a flair
Either way works
Not the same languages, but close enough
Norwegians, Swedes and Danes who live and visit between each other’s often/sometimes switch out words to be better understood
It’s especially usual for Swedes and Norwegians living in the one or the other country, maybe even more for Norwegians in Sweden, to swap some words
I think it’s totally okay and a bit funny, but also a bit unnecessary if we are aware of the differences and can understand each other without any further problems
I try to adapt when speaking with swedes and danes, while they do too
It feels like defeat to speak english with a scandinavian
It’s much easier, isn’t it
Don’t you have any language history in Swedish schools
I teach Norwegian at high school level in Norway, and language history is a fairly large part of the curriculum
The development from Proto-Norse, into old norse and then the modern languages
We read some simple Faroese, Icelandic and Sámi, and of course Swedish and Danish
We all know about the Swedish speaking population in Finland, as well as the tiny Finnish speaking population in Norway
Nou, jeejtje, je klinkt plotseling normaal
Wat geinig
Some of us try actually
I find it hard to believe that there are many Norwegians who don’t know about Swedish speaking Finns
Robert Stoltenberg’s [Piirka character] is one of many reasons for that
I don't understand how regular Russians can be duped into supporting a corrupt ex-KGB thug who's critcs tend to "disappear", end up in prison or "accidentally" die
You know something isn't right when people who criticise Putin keep "accidentally" falling out of windows
I don't understand how the Russian regime thinks they have a right to steal the territory of other countries (like Crimea), and stage fake elections "proving" their "right" to steal said territory
I don't understand how the Russian regime can say other countries who don't have nukes or nowhere near the same amount of troops as them (like Norway), is "threatening" a nuclear power like Russia
I can't understand why they would eat tacos on Saturday and not Friday
I can't think of anything
I do think it's strange that i've never met a finnish person
To my knowledge i haven't spoken to a finn online either
I don't even know what their language sounds like
The Swedish way of letting unelected bureaucrats (like Tegnell) make the decisions rather than the ones who where actually voted in by the public
It's the result of an alliance between the Christian political parties on one hand, and Labour on the other
The first drew inspiration from the American teetotallers, while the latter was more concerned with social issues
The policy came around during World War I, when food imports were scarce and there was a need to control the grain consumption
The result was strict rationing of alcohol
After the war, the policy continued both in Sweden and Norway
Sweden had a rationing system until the 1950s, and Norway had a brief ban on liqueur in the 1920s.
Sweden even banned sale of regular beer outside Systembolaget and restaurants
The policy was a bit laxer in Norway, but with big regional varieties
Some municipalities here were dry until the 1990s. The third largest city today, Stavanger, didn't even want a Vinmonopol, but a local referendum changed that in the 1960s.
The policy of taxing alcohol is even older, and goes back to the Napoleonic Wars
At that time both Norway and Sweden exported large amount of timber
Due to high demand from the shipping industry timber was even cut in the winter, and transported on frozen rivers with horse
The high demand created high wages, and imported booze was easily available
The result was that the logging industry nearly crashed due to excessive alcohol consumption
Loggers fell asleep in the snow, and horse drivers crashed and died
To mitigate this both countries levied import duties on alcohol, which have been in place ever since
In addition, restrictions on using grain for alcohol production came into effect, resulting in the widespread growing and consumption of potatoes as well as the potato-based liqueur aquavit
Lol people eat tacos all day of the week
I get that tacofridays are like our thing, but I don't think that many people actually follow this religiously like many seem to think
Most people I know have tacos whenever they feel like it
Huh, the swedes I've talked to said it was saturday
Didn't know grandiosa was popular in Finland
Thought only norwegians would like such bland pizza
We are the ones eating the most frozen pizzas afterall
It's probaly a lot of marketing behind the whole taco friday thing but it is a nice and easy meal to make for lot's of people
Yes, it is written in law by our king
It just has become a thing to have taco on fridays here
It's weird
We live so close but we know so little about eachother
I think i should visit Helsinki when this virus is over :)
Have you not heard of iced coffees
they are refreshing as hell
Its not like drinking hot cola, its like drinking iced tea
Yeah, religion isn't a consideration in that topic
[The same commercial in norwegian] its called Saturday pizza (lørdagspizza)
Amazing to see it in finnish
Correct
I actually don't personally know a single person who actually partake in religious practices
Maybe some believe in something supernatural, like a God, but they sure as hell don't actually care
Maybe you'll find a large percentage of practicing Muslims among immigrants with Islamic background, but that's about it, I'd say
We google things
And I hear teenagers say they will gmail someone
(We older people still call it email)
In Norway, Potetgull (lit
*potato gold*) is a brand of potato chips/crisps, and is now also the generic term
Correction fluid is almost always referred to as Blanco, although I've almost never seen a bottle of Blanco brand blanco
Gift means both poison and married in Norwegian
Its a bit funny
It's the same in Norwegian: "Drage" is the word for both a kite and dragon
Always enjoyed the word "esposas" in Spanish
We also use the same as you guys
Similar in norwegian, all tree things are called "krone"
Tourists have death wishes I think
Was in the mountains of Dovre with my grandparents to watch the [musk oxen] There was also a Dutch or German caravan there, and they went outside the car and took pics of the animals, even though they were really close
Even as a kid that seemed incredibly stupid
Guess they didn't understand animals can kill
Also was doing an 8 hour drive home, but got stuck in a queue of tourists wanting to see this one fjord
[Narrow road down a mountain] Down comes a dutch car at full speed, passing the queue on the wrong side of the road, barely slowing down enough for the tight turns
A wonder he didn't hit something
Chinese tourists eating smashed potatoes with chocolate sauce
This wasn't particularly dangerous, but
We were at a small hotel in Amsterdam, having breakfast
Another tourist - I believe he was British - came stumbling in
It appears that he had spent much of the night sampling the joys that Amsterdam has to offer after dark, and may or may not have actually been to bed that night
He walked over to the hot drink machine
Now, the machine was labeled in Dutch only, I must give him that
Still
He put a tea bag in a mug, moved the machine to the spout of the machine, and stared at it
HEET WATER, the button on the machine said
The tourist stared
Somewhere there must be hot water that would turn the tea bag into tea
HEET WATER
I honestly don't remember if he figured it out before we left the breakfast room
Perhaps another hotel guest, in a moment of kindness, or simply impatient to get a cup of coffee, helped him
Perhaps he is still standing there to this day, just trying to get a cup of tea
Walk normally on very slippery ice, resulting in them hurting themselves
German tourists going out fishing in a tiny boat in a storm
Chineese tourists walking into people's private gardens, taking photos through the windows
Tourists doing mountain hiking for several hours in ballerina shoes (or similar unsuitable hiking shoes)
People risking their lives taking selfies on the edge of very dangerous cliffs
That being said; 99,9% of tourists are all good
Trying to buy food with actual physical money
I mean, that's not considered weird here
Edit: Unless they were all standing on it at the same time
Sorry in advance
There are geysirs in Ireland, or were you abroad somewhere
The German exchange students I have met here seems to find joking about Hitler funny
Perhaps it's not the norm
I've been there
It is not an entirely unreasonable question if it was on the mainland or Lido, but I'm guessing that was not the case
Well, I've done that
To be fair though, the gravestone was almost 1000 years old and inscribed with runes, so might not be exactly the same
In 2012, four Swiss tourists and their French guide were killed in an avalanche in Lyngen
There were part of a group of 12 where two were guides
Thing is, it seems that though they all were experienced with conditions in the Alps, they did not consider that the mountain they were ascending is right next to the sea and that the additional moisture made the snow wetter and more prone to avalanches than they were used to
They had not consulted local guides
They thought the desert and dinner tables were the same
I think they were pleased believing it was some “Traditional Norwegian food”
very unactual digital money, by *tæpping* my phone or my card at the card reading machine
Ahh, makes sense
But considering giants causeway was magmatic or what it's called, I guessed maybe you still had some volcanic activity
I was in Hamburg right after the G20 riots and spent the night at the train station with some old alcoholics having an AC/DC karaoke night
Don't think I got to see the best side of the city to put it mildly
Damn, I can barely manage with a racket, let alone a staff
Not exactly
You have "landet" (the countryside), which means outside the cities
That one is value neutral
You also have the terms "utkanten" (outer edges), which is negative, and "gokk" (untranslatable), which is derogatory
Both of those basically mean far away from (major) cities
However the rural areas are pretty strong in Norwegian culture
Hmmm, no not really i guess people in oslo look down on everyone else and everyone else looks down at Oslo
"Nord for Sinsenkrysset", which means north of the Sinsen interchange
Basically the "border" where our capital Oslo ends and the rest begins
Used for a long time to describe that those in Oslo doesnt care much about what happens north of ut
I would like to add a saying: "Nord for Sinsenkrysset" ("North of the Sinsen intersection")
The Sinsen intersection was the first, large intersection in Oslo and back in the 1800's it was all forests and farms past it
Therefore, when people for example say "everyone north of Sinsenkrysset are farmers", they mean everyone outside of Oslo are farmers
This saying isn't really used too often, but most people still know about it
What
"Landet" as in from/"fra Landet" is not value neutral
In Oslo at least, saying people are from "Landet" is derogatory, it is implying he/she is a simpleton/naive person unaware of how city folks live and behave
In the countryside, "landet" might have a positive meaning
But in Oslo, if anyone says you are from "landet", they are  basically saying you are a redneck
didnt know gokk was derogatory lmao
I haven't, but a friend of mine who studies in Hungary was talking in Norwegian to her Norwegian classmate about how ugly the teacher's dress was
Turns out the teacher knew Swedish, which is close enough to understand
Karma imo
My mom has such a bad story about this kind of thing
She was in London when she was like 19 and on the tube her and a friend saw some people wearing really expensive jackets, so they were like talking down these people with the expensive jackets
As the person with the expensive jacket gets off the tube she says "It's so nice to hear Norwegian voices
" in Norwegian and walked off
Big oopsie
Not me, but I’ve got this one told to me from an Italian friend who’s been living in Norway since forever
He was walking up the stairs from a metro station in Rome right behind a Norwegian couple
They talked about what they had been doing in the hotel room the other night and what they planned to do when they got back
He said to them (or the woman specifically): “I bet you screamed a lot” in Norwegian
The embarrassment shall have been very visible
Can't say I've done that, but I talked with a random dude I met at a train station somewhere down on the continent in english for about 10 minutes before he asked me where I was from and I said "Norway", then he switched over to norwegian and said he was from Bergen
I don't find people in any country dressing that differently from the average Norwegian
But Swedish (city) men dress slightly better than Norwegian men
Some Finish ladies dressed [like this] I was also impressed at Russian ladies being able to dress really elegant in -25 degrees
And people outside the Nordic might dress a bit more formal for work
No I have never seen them do that
You can't really tell that someone is Romani in Norway unless they tell you
Right now: not at all
I've never casually just gone to Sweden as I live far from the border
However I have family who lives very close to the border and they go about once a week to shop, as groceries are (generally) cheaper in Sweden
Before Corona I'd visit Sweden once or twice every summer just to get some cheap beer and get away for the weekend
Back in 2011, I travelled to Paris, France by plane, carrying no other ID than my norwegian debit card (it has a picture of me)
Right now even going to Sweden for me as a Norwegian is not casual
But we have been able to casually go to Denmark for the last weeks since corona-borders were opened
I would say people close to Sweden might visit Sweden once a month
I live far away from the Swedish border so here people might go abroad on average twice a year (including outside Europe)
But that being said - I always bring my passport even within Schengen, but that is more for ID and banking purposes
As I never have to show my passport at borders
Because that's sooo far away
/s :-)
We went to malaga for a school trip, but it wasn't just like "hey, let's hop on a flight
" We all knew about the trip 2 years beforehand and planned it for about 4 months
Haha, that's funny
You have a beautiful country though
Once this coronasituation is over, Slovenia will be the first country I'll visit
I'm already looking at the maps and making plans, and a roundtrip from Ljubljana to Kranjska Gora down Soča to Piran and back to Ljubljana is only a six hour drive
Finally a country I can visit and make many stops along the road and really enjoy my time
You need to bring a passport when going to another country
You don't need your passport with you if you for example go from California to Nevada
How true is it that countries have different cultures, languages, laws etc
It's very much true
For example, we share a border with Russia (all the way up north in Norway) and I'd say our cultures/languages etc are very much different
I went to Finland about 2 years ago (who we also share a border with) . I did not understand a word of Finnish
Sure, Scandinavian languages for example are pretty similar, but not so similar that they're like dialects of the same language
That experience for me wasn't actually that much different from when I was an exchange student in the US
We planned a class trip to Mexico
Thanks for reminding me about Bohinj
I'll even add Bled to the list as well
We'll make a 1,5-2 week family vacation out of this
Also, two days will be spent in Planica (big fan of skijumping)
Aah, yeah we don't have a national ID
Apparently out government have been talking about developing one since at least 2012, but the re we are
Still no ID in sight
We don't have an ID card in Norway
The only valid Norwegian ID is our passports
Thank you
So many things to do
I'll save your post for further planning :-) Btw bograč... OMG that sounds delicious
In other countries: with a passport
IN Norway: with a driver's license or bank card (debit/credit card)
Well, I don't know anyone above the age of 12 who doesn't have at least a debit card
And I don't see why someone younger than that would need to identify themselves in Norway
I had a large offroad car that looked like shit
The grown ups in real cars definitely didn't wanna mess with me in traffic
Then I got a small but decent enough Polo, and I was completely invisible for other drivers
After that I got a grown up car, and my rights in the traffic was reinstated
I just ride my bike there on that one day in the end of July  when Centre is closed for traffic
Schlafrock
Of course it is
We call it «slåbrok», i guess it is the same etymology
I always thought it ment «wrapped (slå) pants (brok)», but sleeping dress is obvious
Thanks for new insight
Our word for taxi, _drosje_, comes from Russian _дрожки_ (dróžjki)
Most of us think of it as a native Norwegian word
Thank you
We say dørslag in norwegian as well, and it made no sense to me until now
> "through-hit"
Don't you use the word "slå" in the meaning to pour in Danish
At least we do in Norwegian
You can slå/helle/tømme vannet av potetene
I figured it was «slag» as in «omslagskjole».
The French word might come from the Norwegians/Danes who settled in northern France
It's "mur" in Norwegian as well, and most likely also Danish
I guess Polish
They are the single biggest immigrant group in the country by a wide margin
It's also the foreign language I notices the most when I am out and about
Swedish probably
Although it would be nice it if was Sami
Edit: Nope, its Polish
I think its German
In school, we have to choose a third language
The majority today choose Spanish, as it is seen as quite exotic, but Spanish is a recent addition to the education system
Before Spanish was added, the most common one was German and I think it still is the most spoken third language, although in the future it cold be Spanish
I was about to correct you since I thought it was Swedes, but according to [wikipedia] Poles are the largest group at around 90k, Swedes come second at around 40k.
And somehow, this has still not improved the sausage situation in Norway as much as I had hoped
Lithuanians have now overtaken Swedes too
See here for updated statistics:
Norway and Iceland are "flooded" with Poles, but for some reason there aren't *that* many in Sweden relative to their population
They have quite similar number of Poles as us despite having twice the population and they have many other immigrant groups that are much larger there
Yes, it does
Actually it more than balances it out
We get more bang for the buck than most countries except on a few commodities like alcohol and sugar
The narrative of Norway being extremely expensive to live in is completely false, but somehow is continuously repeated by both foreigners and Norwegians who don’t understand basic economics
Yeah, it’s definitely a complaining thing
Probably yes, but it’s more of a rural thing, I don’t know many who brew their own alcohol except for a few beer aficionados
Yes, people who live close to the Swedish border (which is a big portion of the countrys population) often go to Sweden to buy alcohol and candy
It is quite common to brew your own alcohol outside of the big cities
In Trøndelag it is quite common to brew brennvin (strong liqour) prefferably over 60% and add it to coffe to make karsk
I’d disagree
Or maybe it was just my class, but we all had broken the school network to our wishes, downloading Minecraft, fortnite and other stuff
One even deleted his remarks lmao
Well i really disagree as a fellow Norwegian
Its looked down upon, like the people who do it are problem kids or something
It might be more popular in larger cities I don't know
I actually have no idea
Never met anyone that I know have even tried it
(Obviously some might and never said)
But my guess is that alcohol is the preferred drug on the countryside, and cannabis might be more popular in the cities
I do wonder if the drug culture being small and looked down upon in the Nordics has anything to do with the happiness levels
You don't have to go too far in Oslo to get the smell of weed
Ocasionally smell it downtown in Trondheim or Bergen also, but as a person who used it before I guess I notice the smell quite easily
I think many people in our country looks down upon it, but it really depends on what group of people and what age
I feel like the younger generation are becoming pretty open minded towards it these days
From reading the answers I assume the Nordics is the only place in Europe where drugs aren't really accepted and are looked down upon
I dont think weed is looked down upon thar heavily especially not in younger circles
In general terms I agree, it feels like it is becoming more acceptable amongst the youth
Though, I have experienced younger people who really dislike it and think people who use it must have some kind of problem
Its funny how some people look down upon it while themselves get blackout drunk every weekend
I'm young and in my friend group weed is something only "narkomaner" does
So I'd say that outside friend groups who do weed it is looked down upon
Norwegian likes to reform the spelling of foreign words: x -> ks, c -> k/s, w -> v etc
This has also been done with names so now we have several spellings of names where one is the etymological spelling and the other is the reformed spelling: Christian/Kristian, Marcus/Markus, Nicholas, Nikolas
A lot of common european feminine names ending in a may in danish  end in e instead
Because Norway was under Danish influence for so long we also have these Danish versions as well: Maria/Marie, Anna/Anne, Julia/Julie
These two factors combined result in names such as:
Christina/Christine/Kristina/Kristine
Cathrina/Katrina/Cathrine/Katrine
Sophia/Sofia/Sophie/Sofie
We mix teach/learn (same word in Norwegian)
We also tend to forget to write for instance "can't" instead of "can not"
No, I've got it pretty good so I wouldn't ever permanently leave Norway
My husband and I are planning to move outside of europe in some years
He has Thai citizenship
We do live comfortable in Norway but we can live even better in Thailand
We both have family there, have careers where it's easy to get work and are learning the language
Very simply we want to move for better quality (save more money, be with family etc) of life
It seems a little backwards for some to move from Norway to Thailand lol
>Shout out to my ancestors for barely surviving on this hostile rock until modern technology made us prosperous
Ur welcome
Definitely
If you are fluent in English, Norwegian should be one of the easiest languages to learn
Almost, it's called jernbane - iron track
Interesting, we use sporvei/sporveg in Norwegian too, but only for light rail and tram
Edit: We have those others too
Normalspor, bredspor, smalspor
We also have jernbane though
Why are they simple
They are named after the place they’re in, which from my experience is the norm everywhere else as well
I guess in some metro systems (like in NYC and London) they are more often named after street names, which you won’t find in Oslo, is that what you are referring to
And by the way, t-bane is not considered to run on a railroad anyways
Never thought of that, but I guess they are
Yup, I said that in another comment, could have put it in here as well
Wouldn't bane be circuit
In Bergen, yes
The light rail system in Oslo is called "trikk", short for "elektrikk". It's a super old-fashioned type of word, it originates from when the light rail system was first electrified in 1894 (it used to be horse-drawn)
Ah Sorry, i didn’t see it
Same in Trondheim
No worries, neither am I! I was just wondering what exactly makes them simple
Yes, it's a big country with quite few people
In the east are mostly woods, but the rest is mountanious
We live quite spread out, so there live people here and there
It's easier to not meet people in the middle part of the southern norway and north of norway, i.e people live along the coast
The thing is, almost everyone in Norway owns a cabin in the mountains; so while you do see houses in almost every valley and mountainside, you can actually go for miles without seeing actual people, as most cabins remain uninhabited in the off-season
Very, very little
Some very small areas were you can be more that a few kilometers from structures, but not real wilderness
Its a tradgedy for sure, cause we have lots of potential
There is no movement here to protect the little we have, and a few decades all we have left is parks and agriculture
Last summer I went on a roadtrip with a few friends to roughly the middle of the country and we drove for an eternity with absolutely nothingness around us at one point
There are definitely countless of areas in Norway that are not equipped for civilization to take place
If you look at population density maps of the country you will also find that there are chunks of spaces where there are recorded to be 0-1 inhabitants and I have a feeling that there might be a geographical explaination for this
Oh yeah, if you get lost in the uninhabited part of the mountains, there is neither cellphone coverage or extensive rescue teams
Dont get lost
Problem is there are people everywhere
And we dont have real forests, its all for timber production and pasture for moose
But we could have had if there was a will to preserve it, and if people actually knew what a real forest looks like
There's a while lotta nothing over at you guys' place
“Don’t have real forest”
Breh have you ever been to Innlandet
I can assure you we got tons and tons of “real forest” here
Ooops forgot
Norway
Yes there are some tundra areas that are not so densley populated, Finnmark has many of them
But they are not huge, and its not very remote, there is human activity there
Im not sure how many places you can find 100km from a road, if any
There is a lot of details lacking from google maps, especialyy in places like that
I know we might have some more wilderness if compared to many other places in europe, bit its not really much at all
Very little is unspoiled, and only in small patches scattered around
Its sadly difficult to get lost and die here, unless you have an accident
Yeah there are many small patches of real forest scattered around, in very steep valleys and other places where its difficult to get the timber out
Im telemarking, have seen some
But they are tiny islands in a big sea of wood and moose plantations
So its not real wilderness, and its not really remote
Miljødirektoratet says we have 11,5 % "villmarkspreget" area,  a lot of this is tundra
Southern norway is less than 5%, this is including hardangervidda, so very little "villmarksprega" forest, and no really big continuous areas
Yes they are
You guys still have a lot of that
Take good care of it, when its gone its gone
Yes i see what you mean, and in some weird way we do
Thing is its not wilderness
The forest we have is farmland, its all maintained for economic purposes, and has a very low biodiversity
So its not really wilderness
Continental europe has bigger patches of real forest than we do
And we are not very densly populated, but unlike sweden and finland, people here live everywhere
So no mattrr where you go tjere is always roads and powerlines nearby
For prime minister, not much at all
For monarchy, I think there would be a lot of debate if let’s say Princess Ingrid Alexandra (future queen of Norway) were to marry or be involved with a foreigner
Now if the foreigner were from another monarchy in Europe it wouldn’t matter as much(especially if from the Swedish or danish monarchy)
Or if the person was from Sweden and Denmark in general(maybe even norther Europe), but if they were from Asia, Africa, southern America, northern Oceania and maybe even norther America, there would be way more debate
Especially if they were too have a non ethnic Norwegian appearance
But idk really
One of our princesses has an American boyfriend named [Durek Verret] who is a self proclaimed shaman
and she has faced a lot of criticism for the shaman part, not necessarily for his ethnicity
Very sorry for the Norwegian link [daily mail article about the same guy]
Our next head of state, Crown Prince Haakon, was already born in Norway
Even the next after him,  Princess Ingrid Alexandra, was born in Norway
So it is highly unlikely that our next head of state will be born in an other country unless something revolutionary happens
Our kings's grandparents came from UK and Denmark
Was never an issue
Our head of state is the grandchild of an immigrant family from Denmark
Head of state = president/king
Head of government = PM
Klassekampen
At least I think they come the closest
Traditionally the Norwegian government has been very supportive of the newspapers
It’s pretty much the same over here, including the no one cares bit
England
We used to go there on
urhm
holidays
Sweden and Denmark
But we are more like brothers than friends I guess
Finland and Island are our cousins, so very much part of the family
Either Norway because we kind of emerged from them by mitosis, or Canada because a bunch of Icelanders were lured there by Mormons in the 1800s and never came back
They set up camp forever, and now Canada has Icelandic settlements
Young Canadians (and to a smaller extent, Americans in the northern Midwest) with Icelandic heritage are becoming increasingly interested in their heritage, and vice versa, so there's a lot of connection between the two still
Uhhh
Us and the US have been allies since ww2 2but that's not too long I think
Only one I can come up with
I always thought germany and france were the best of friends
Fine
Then we will be friends with Denmark instead
Well, could’ve been Denmark, could’ve been Iceland as well since we founded the place
Denmark ruled Norway for 400 years from Copenhagen, so I don’t know if we can say we have been friends for a long time
The same goes about you as well, we are friends now, but once upon the time you were our greatest fear
Same story about us and UK too, we were their darkest nightmare, today we are close friends
More you guys realy, Denmark kind of fucked our culture from 1397 to 1814 and you can still see the hushed resentment in our history books
Well, the period Denmark ruled over us is called "the 400 years night" so you might be on to something
That being said, I don't think anyone seriously hold any grudges or anything like that  towards Danes, that would be straight up stupid
Swedes on the other hand
The norwegians went mostly to Scotland and Ireland (and obv all the smaller islands), it was denmark that conquered England proper like /u/Junelli suggests
I don't mind honestly
I wonder if Island sometimes feels a bit alone in the world
Ah, okay, I just misunderstood a bit
A t-shirt saying "New York" or "Chicago" or some other city name is more common
That's the correct answer ️
Our jokes usually make fun of Swedes and/or Danes
Most of the jokes make fun of Swedes
For example this one: “Hvorfor sitter svensken på do med døra åpen
Fordi han er redd for at noen skal se gjennom nøkkelhullet
(Why does the Swede sit on the toilet with the door open
Because he is afraid of people peeking through the keyhole)”
I want to move into germany now
It's not the main source of day to day humor (at least in the west)
We are mainly sarcastic and don't take ourselves that serious
However, a good chance to laugh at a Swede is always fun and we do love word plays and dry jokes
I don’t know
It is just the first type of jokes that I think of
Can confirm
None of my children know a single Sweden joke
Im 23 and I grew up with them
Gult regn i Kina var favoritten i barnehagen
Totally unrelated, but the TV drama Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip starts with a fictional TV shoe producer having a meltdown on love television
Good series
I hope other Norwegians can back me up because I'm on mobile and not bothered linking
But the falling man mountain
I think that's the name
It's a mountain where everything thinks it will fall at some point
The running joke is that he hasn't. There's a whole website dedicated to 'is it still standing
People from Bergen and how generally obnoxious we are
Yes
Mainly Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, UK
But also France and Germany
And of course whenever an event in a European country makes Norwegian news
Like most recently the Croatian earthquake or the Italian mafia trial
I keep up somewhat with Swedish politics because Sweden is similar to us, I often visit Sweden, and I understand the language
It's very entertaining, especially debates are fun to watch
Its in the same way a lot of people follow US politics, but not that extreme, at least yet
Nrk is prty unbiased
I have felt safe wherever I have been
But I guess some of [the mountains] can be scary if you are not an experienced climber/hiker
Oh, how interesting
Tell us more please
What where the tunnels used for, and why are they connected to so many houses
My man and I saw this in a special episode of Ghost Adventures and we were really intrigued
Especially by that circle in the middle of the woods where nothing grows
We really wanna check it out, but Im sort of a wuzz and Im not sure I have the guts to actually check it out, Especially not after dark, but it's a fun thing we talk about whenever we go down that route
> Villa rašica is a villa where satanists are doing their rites and sacrefices
Why there
Looking at [photos] it seems an unlikely location
Unless I am looking at the wrong photos
Oof, my class went on a trip with the White Buses foundation in 10th grade to Auschwitz, both the camps, Sachsenhausen and Ravensbrück
It was a mess of a trip since barely anyone in my class got a long, so there was a lot of drama on top of the actual trauma of seeing these places
I prepared myself a lot in advance by looking at pictures, documentaries, reading stories of survivors, including the story of one of my best friends' grandfather who was Polish, who was forced out of his home when the nazis came, and witnessed the murder of his grandfather when he refused to give up the family farm
I thought I prepared myself a lot, but nothing could really prepare me at all for what we saw
I can still smell the tons of hair we saw, still feel the heaviness of the areas, still see worn down stairs, the walls where they executed prisoners where you could still count the bullet holes, and the scratches on the walls in the surviving gas chambers
Names were scratched into the areas where they slept at night
I had nightmares for several weeks after and was unable to get any decent sleep
It was hands down the most horrifying trip of my life
We had a survivor with us on the bus who had been in Sachsenhausen who shared his story once we entered Sachsenhausen
He walked the same exact paths where the nazis ordered him to walk as punishments for whatever, explained in detail how the whole thing was
Im not sure I would have that kind of strength after surviving something like that
When we came to Ravensbrück, we met another White Buses tour from Norway, who also had a witness who had survived Ravensbrück
We swapped witnesses for a while so our guy could tell his story to the other bus, and their woman could tell her story to us
They had one of the massive tools standing outside the entrance and she actually used that same thing as a work tool when she was imprisoned there
That thing was bigger than her by a lot and she explained that they were at least three people at the time to push it around and of they werent fast enough, they'd be very physically punished
She told her story without even a glimpse of negative emotion
Like it was something everyone survived
Normal
I still think about her, and our own witness
I dont think I will ever be able to forget that trip
These camps
The omnious feeling, even a feeling of despair
Every time I think back on that time, I end up being stuck there for hours, sometimes even days, just remembering all the smells, the sounds, the feelings I had when we walked through the camps and learned of all the extreme torture that happened there
It goes on and ond, just like this post Im writing now
and then I always end up frustrated that no words will ever explain those feelings and those terrors
In retrospect Im somewhat glad to have seen it, but Im never gonna go back there
Ever
I was thinking about north eastern Svalbard
Far away from any sort of help, cold, dark and lots of polar bears
I think there is a troll cage in Hardanger, and another troll cage in Jotunheimen
I hear they ate a journalist once, and probably some German tourists
True
And the part of Antarctica which we have claimed can also be kind of scary, especially in winter
The [Bouvet Island] can probably also be quite a scary place
Do you know how old the tunnels are
Or, do you know how old your house is
Interesting that they still exist so many years later
Nice, thanks for that info
That suddenly made this trip a bit more realistic to try out
That's the part that gave me nightmares
The fact that people can be that evil
I still have them from time to time, if something on the news is bad enough
We seem to get so desensitized to evil these days
But this kind of evil still exists
People who just follow orders from evil people without questions, just like so many did during ww2
I wish it was more accessible for everyone in this world to see these horrific places first hand
Even the hardcore tough guys in my class struggled to maintain their composures in some of the camps
Especially as we entered one of the surgical suites where Dr
Mengele ordered his experiments
I dont think it was his main surgical suite, but he was there
I eventually had to leave that room
I tolerate a lot of gore and ugly body stuff, but to know that these poor victims had forced surgeries they didnt need without any anesthetics, sometimes even have live animals put inside them
To know all the gory details people had to live through, as I eventually found myself placeing myself inside their heads, thinking about how they must have felt
It was too much and I had to get myself away from that before I passed out
Sorry, this got long again
I just find it hard to leave those places in my mind whenever I first go there
I tried to say that I wish everyone could see these camps so that everyone is more aware, so we can say never again, and actually mean it
Never again will we as people stand for hatred, never again will we put people through all that hell
But as a people of this world, so many still fuel hatred, still torture people, still comitting genocide
It scares me, and it breaks my heart
Humanity is capable of so much good, yet so many choose to do evil
I used to want to be a writer actually, but it's probably not in the cards for me
I ramble too much
Haha
Being used as a escape route makes sense
Thanks for checking
Very, by the time I could legally buy liquor (20) I could barely stand it anymore
When I was in high school I could chug a pint of vodka like it was nothing, but when I could actually buy myself, my binge drinking days were already over
Very popular, but it is declining
Following a trend in the western world where the youth drink less, less partying, has less sex etc
And at the same time rate of depression and anxiety has almost doubled the last 10 years
Poor kids need to get of SoMe and get some moonshine
Very common
I was about to lecture my 16 year old little brother for drinking at parties, but then i remembered that i started drinking at 15 myself
Very
we usually start around 14 in small amounts
like two beers and possibly some liqour
then it increases massively during 15 and 16 and takes off completely during 18 when we have our Russ celebration
There’s no drinking age in Norway or Denmark
There is however an age limit on buying alcohol
You cannot give alcohol to minors in Norway, so I'm quite sure Norway has a drinking age
Well, there’s no official law stating one
But because of the laws saying you can’t buy until you’re 18, combined with not being able to legally give minors alcohol, it makes the unofficial drinking age 18
Which is different than in Denmark
You know what I meant FFS
It makes little difference for Norway if the ruling party is the largest left party or the largest right party
There are differences, but they are minor
Which is great in my opinion, since then there is less chance they will run our country into the ditch
The smaller parties also have power, since neither of the large parties can rule without support from some of them, which creates extra balance
This is pretty much like Norway, except our Centerpartiet is not about environmentalism, it is like a populist farmers party that likes public spending
And our Kristdemokraterna is a party in the centre, recently had a fight if they should support the socialdemocrats or the conservatives
It has traditionally been a conservative party, but party leader wanted to lean towards the left
The majority of the party didn't, but it is a split party
Our Vensterpartiet is a green libertarian party, leaning conservative
Discord
I'm guessing the gamers in here knows what it is
For everyone else, it's basically an application for voice/text chat mostly used by gamers
I think Discord is a great app and and the developers are even better imo
I've paid for Discord Nitro for some years now, and every month they send a nice e-mail saying thank you and throw some funny jokes in there as well
In addition, they send free gifts whenever they can
Recently I received a  months Xbox Live Gold Subscription free of charge from them
And also a 3 months free Nitro subscription I could give to anyone I want
Think they do nice and good business with their customers
Perhaps boringly we can say the virtually direct translation "Greit nok
" "Greit" meaning "fair" or "ok" despite probably sharing etymology with the English "great"
Is romanizing δ as ð a cypriot greek thing
Well my fellow countryman, that might be that the English thought themselves great, but by viking standard they where "Greit nok"
Lol hør, hør bror
Føler ofte at de fleste aldersgrupper bare bruker og blander engelske utrykk - fair enough / whatever / oh my god / shit / no big deal osv er blitt en del av språket
Ja det er blitt litt sånn, men føler ikke det er så negativt, språk må jo utvikles av de som bruker det
Og om det da blir nærmere engelsk så blir det jo bare lettere å bli tospråklig
Weeell, every norweigan teacher I know openly despise the use of foreign words, and we have more than enough people wanting to make foreign words into norweigan
It feels a bit worthless tho imo, we are less than 5
5 million people, we are litterally less people than some big cities, and we need to adapt to stay relevant in global trade anyway
And while I don't think many norweigan people think of our language as "danish with norweigan pronounciation" before we're thought history as teenagers, it sort of is
We all have to trade something away to streamline and become a more complex and global society
Like a minor state in civ 5, you don't play to conquer, you play to prosper and ensure peace
Traditionally a woman took her husband's last name, and their oldest children inherited the first name of one of the grandparents
Nowadays you can choose more freely (although there are names you are not allowed to call your children
"Hitler" would be one example)
So most people have 1 or 2 first names, and 1 last name (but sometimes 2)
Some years ago I had a summer job at a travel agency
And quite often I was booking tickets for a family where for instance the father had one last name, the mother another last name, 1 child had the fathers last name, 2 children had the mothers last name, and then the youngest child had both last names
So divorce and remarrying can make things more complicated name-wise
It depends
Middle names or two surnames are quite common, and many kids adopt both of their parents’ surnames
Only sometimes the kids only adopt one of their parents surnames
I had a friend who inherited both of her surnames from her father so it can change
Usually, wives take their husband’s surname too
I would be dead
I was born with a hole in my heart
I needed surgery
As the oldest son, I would we working on my family's farm
I would probably be a sailor or logger in the woods until i caught pneumonia and died from that
Thank modern medicine for antibiotics (and we're fucked when all bacteria get resistent \*glancing angrily at doctors with loose antibiotic practices\*
My family were merchants, so I guess I would be that too
I would have been rather excited about our new, enlightened, constitution of 1814, but I hope I would have been a little skeptical of the paragraph that said Jews weren't allowed to enter the country
I would also have been somewhat annoyed that the British pressured Denmark to give us away to Sweden as part of the aftermath of the Napoleonic war
Been independent from Denmark for 5 years, so I could’ve used my flair on Reddit, if Reddit was around in 1819
Depending on where my ancestors came from, I would either be a fisherman living on the coast, a farmer in the countryside, or working in a workshop in the city or a city-boy going to sea
I don’t think I would live in 1819, but it would be pretty cool to see the world back then without modern infrastructure or buildings
It would be pretty cool to see London in 1819
Thinking about the world in 1819 makes me wonder how it’ll be in 2219
Honest, I like it
In Amsterdam by the red light district, IF you pay enough
Nowadays everyone will say the North Pole, inclusing me
My hometown of Drøbak, Norway has a Santa Claus
There is a 'julehus' (Christmas house) here that sells everything related to Christmas
He has an office in Drøbak and receives a ton of mail from kids worldwide every year
Here in Norway we say that he lives on the North Pole, which I thought was the normal in most countries
I didn’t know Danes says the he lives on Grenland but it makes sense
It would have been very cool if we also reffered to more specific areas like Antartica beacuse we control a part of that area
The North Pole, alternatively a mountain or hill near you, but officially residing in Drøbak
We're a little confused about the whole Santa Claus thing
We used to leave porridge etc
for the local
creature
and it sort of merged with the German/American Santa character
So in a sense, Santa lives on each farmstead, underground with the other elfs/goblins/undead
Well what i was told as a kid was that he lived in Svalbard, which is a Island north of Norway
If it is the American one it is on he north pole, but we also have like «farm santas» that are supposed to be very short and wear traditional wool clothes, they help out around the farm, and live in the barn
We don't have the american Santa Claus, but our "Santa" or julenisse lives in either Drøbak or Longyearbyen in Svalbard
So, this boat, how many horsepowers does it have
I've never met a Norwegian kid who says Drøbak or Longyearbyen
It's always North Pole
Huh
Jesus is a girl in Austria
First time I hear about this
We also say «nisser» like the american one is «nissen» (The santa)
But yeah famr santas are nisser or gårds nisser (just farm santas)
That is because they watch the american movies
Then why the carrot for the horse
Ah ok
How interesting
Having Santa Claus as his helper
I have a 10 year old who is about that height, so "baby" Jesus is stretching it a bit though
Of course, I thought maybe the boat was drawn by horses
Isn’t that one of the pretty standard stories
Like Santa parking his reindeers at the roof and climbing down the chimney
Why Spain btw
I was once asked «at what time do the fjords open
». Left me quite confused
1) Polar bears
People think they’ll see polar bears in the wild if they travel to Norway (and they often do not know that Svalbard is a thing, so that is often the cause of confusion)
2) That we’re very proud of our viking heritage
Yes we have lots of museums and a decent sized re-enacting community, but the average Norwegian will be clueless if you ask them about the viking age
3) That you will see northern lights, no matter where in Norway you are
Sorry, nope
Have to be faaar up north and in the right season to have a chance at seeing any, and you still might not
4) Tourist ask when the fjords “open”. No joke
They expect some guided, sweat free fjord experience
Im half Australian, half Norwegian, have lived extensively in both countries, always got asked the bog standard questions growing up
Does everyone have a pet kangaroo that they ride to school/work
Do polar bears wander down the street
Are you in porn
Talked to someone on a discord chat about going on a boat trip this summer
they didn’t think it was possible because "Norway is covered in ice"
Tbf, there are polar bears in Norway, just not on the mainland
I've also heard that some people get angry/disappointed when they realize the midnight sun is the same sun as the "normal" one
Hey now, you don't have to be *that* far north for a chance at northern lights
I've seen them in Møre og Romsdal
Ah, the good old "I'm coming to Oslo in august, any chance I'll see some northern lights
> Are you in porn
wat
Møre og Romsdal is quite far north for most southerners lol
I’ve seen them in Oslo too, but I have had tourists visiting my restaurant (in Asker), wondering when they were going to catch some northern lights
Yup
Been asked that a few times actually
And no, I don't dress or act overly sexual
Australians are quite conservative
Scandinavians are seen as being quite liberal, especially sexually (which, tbh, is true
At least in comparison
But Aussies aren't prudish by any means)
I think this stems from old stereotypes from the 70s and 80s, when Scandinavia went through a sort of sexual liberation/revolution
That image sorta stuck internationally
Pair that with the fact that I look like a typical Scandinavian, I guess I fulfilled a certain
fantasy
I mean, this was during the age of American Pie foreign exchange student vibes type stuff, so there was a culture of it
That's what I've assumed over the years, in any case
But yeah
been asked quite a few times, or had other weird sexual comments made once my nationality is brought up
Scandinavians are definitely sexualised overseas
I think its generally the most popular pasta dish in europe seeing how easy it is to make
Not even ready made it takes me 25mins to make the sauce obv its not "real"
Døgn
As mentioned by some scandi folk above
Why on earth doesn’t it exist in English
I also find myself lacking when I want to talk about Pålegg
It’s the stuff that goes on top of your slice of bread
I know the word “spread” exist, but Pålegg includes everything you put on your bread
Ham, sousages, cheese etc
Skadefryd is another one
In English, they use the German word
They should have their own
Pålegg
It’s used for everything you would put on bread
Cheese, ham, jam, peanut butter, nutella, pattés, mayo
It’s all pålegg
Skadefryd, it means the same as the German schadenfreude
It's such good word
We have an expression with it too "skadefryd er ekte fryd" or "skadefryd is real joy" I use it alot
In English, the gender neutral pronoun is «they», which I always have found weird
In Norwegian, we have han (him), hun (she) and hen (gender neutral)
We have "oversiktlig" too
Ordered, well structured, easily understandable
That’s funny, kinda sounds like ‘castled’, like as if you’re in one
I guess in Norwegian it would be "Koselig" or "Hyggelig"
In Norwegian we use something like «oida» for the English «oops
», like if you suddenly fall or something, we can say «oida».
Well spotted
Interesting, we have "belegg" for that, it means something on the surface, like a type of waterproof coating on a floor would be "gulvbelegg", it has other meanings aswell, as it can be used as the English word proof: "You have no proof of that claim" Norwegian: "Du har ikke belegg for den påstanden". It's also for a group of people occupying a vehicle, gathering hall etc, or hotel rooms
Not sure if English has a specific word like that, it would be used like so: "The hotel will have new guests occupying all the previously used rooms" Norwegian: "Hotellet har fullt belegg"
Most times when languages borrow words from each other, they make their own pronunciation or spelling of it, so it’s a little integrated in the language
The Norwegian word Vindauga is not pronounced or spelt Vindauga when an English speaker is talking about their window
You say window
As a non-native speaker, whooping out a German word (with German pronunciation) when I’m trying to speak English, screws up my flow
Having an English word, that fit in a little better, would help a lot
I'm not native but does that specify which kind of relationship it is
Married
Engaged
Or just a boyfriend/girlfriend
Kæreste is very specific and means boyfriend/girlfriend
Yeah but it's not very English is it
It sounds so out of place every time I read it, or is that just me
You sound so offended
I think you are completely missing my intent with the original comment
There is a difference between using English words as an established slang, where you choose to use English because you can - and not because you have to
Being fluent in Norwegian, and decent in English, most Norwegians find it easy to switch between the two when they’re joking around
In terms of schadenfreude, I have to dig up a memory of a third language I don’t speak, because there isn’t any English alternative
So I’ll repeat myself; English should have an alternative
Because English is such an elaborate language and schadenfreude is such a legit feeling
I am legitimately surprised English doesn’t have their own word for it
Same with Døgn
And Pålegg
The whole point of “which word from your native language did you wish could translate perfectly in English but doesn’t” is to state what words I wish could translate perfectly to English, but can’t.
Some things doesn’t translate directly or perfectly
That’s the point
Different words or phrases that kinda mean the same, but lack the precision we are used to in our own language
I am able to make myself understood even if I can’t use the words I mentioned, but I sometimes wish I could just say døgn and have people nod
[Galleri Oslo ] is officially the ugliest building in Oslo, built as an indoors shopping street in the 80s as motorways were built in the city centre
Personally I would like to nominate [the new National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design] and [the new Munch Museum ] as well
This supposed museum or whatever it is
I'm between speachless and "haha, what, why
" and "I would really like one in my neighborhood
This phenomenon must have a name
This breaks all standard "rejuvenation of old architecture" that I've ever seen before
I don't hate it though
No offense, but you guys are morons
That new place looks like a prison
I can not believe that the council allowed tearing down a beautiful historic building to build a brick there
I won't argue that this hasn't happened in Norway, too
Probably lots of examples if we dig through history and old pictures
Yes, we have a class about the core concepts of each major religion and some ethics
With all the conflict created by religion in the world, I think it's important to know something about it
Yes we do
We learn christianity mainly beacuse it’s our state religion and other religions too see the world from other viewpoints
Yeah
They do it so we are more educated on other religons, and so we stay safe out in the world and are respectable towards others :)
When I went to school, we had RLE (name of the subject), mixing religion, lifestyle and ethics into one subject
I’m very happy with the way it was taught; we weren’t taught that any one of religions was the answer - it was far more general and we learned what people believe, why etc
Then lifestyle and ethics were two different categories on the side
I’m surprised some people don’t see the need for kids learning about religions
Religion is a big part of many cultures and have affected history, and still is affecting the world
Of corse kids need to learn something about it
Many kids will also encounter people of different religions, obviously it’s not great if the only things they have heard about those religions are biased stuff from internet (or their bigot parents)
What I don’t like, is too much focus on one religion, like ~~Christians~~ Christianity (autocorrect) here (I didn’t feel like it was too bad when I was in school, but I think it’s changed a little)
Perhaps those from other countries, that oppose teaching religion in school, are from places where they mostly just focus on the country’s religion, because that just sucks
Like you mentioned we also learned ethics
And we also learn about other beliefs/views, that aren’t  religions, for example putting the humans, rather than religion, in the center
Pretty much the same here, but i feel like it was like 30% philosophy and life, and 70% religion
Its called KRLE now, being more focused on christianity, at least in ungdomsskolen, but videregående has religion
When I was in school it was called KRL (Christianity, Religion and Lifestance), then it was changed to RLE (Religion, Lifestance and Ethics) to de-emphasize Christianity, and with the current government they renamed it KRLE (Christianity, Religion, Lifestance and Ethics) to appease small religious fraction that's part of their base of power
Throughout the contents have been similar though and it's always been about what people believe rather than what you should believe
Tell him that the reason there are so many electric cars in Norway is because they're so quiet that you can get inside your house before the polar bears notices you getting home in rural parts of the country
Tell him that he must ask the waiters/bartenders for permission before going to the bathrooms
Everyone you meet must be greeted with a kiss
Tell him that we normally don't ride polar bears to school/work in Northern Europe :)
Just go to the bank and get one
"Take to hold"? So you're saying in the Rhineland the guy will hold your dick in his hand for how long exactly
I’m terrible at eye contact, I’m from Norway
Trondheim
It´s more in the middle of the country, the third largest city and has been the capital once
But the people of Bergen would want to kill me after
Trondheim
It has acces to sea like Oslo but it’s in the middle of the country and it is a historically important city for Norway, but mostly beacuse I live next to it
I wouldn’t want to move the capital I think Oslo is a good enough place for it
Trondheim I guess
It's in the middle of the country and historically it has been our capital
But that was 800 years ago
I'm happy as long as it's not Bergen
I was going to suggest the same city
Trondheim's central placement in the country would be a nice benefit
I think it’s pretty much ripped off lol
In the norwegian translation the city’s called Tronsheim, and it sent me for a spin the first time I read it
I think we depend more on the EU than EU depends on us
We only have oil, which the world hopefully will need less of, and fish
We’re not important what so ever so you are more important than us:)
Yeah, it’s stupid
I would much rather be fully in than halfway in (no sexual pun intended)
But this is an extremely unpopular opinion here
Something about sharing oil and fishing rights which may or may not be an actual problem depending on who you ask, and besides people don’t really care about the EU membership issue anymore
We do have hydropower, but I don't think we produce enough electricity to be considered important
We are definitely storing energy as well
We have many dam reservoirs which are filled up during low demand periods and used to generator more electricity in high demand periods
The positives FAR outweighs the negatives
I have a child who was born with a condition that causes us to call the ambulance quite often
(Last time was one month ago)
So in total he has been submitted to the hospital around 10 times the last couple of years
Ambulance every time, except once when he was transported to the hospital in a ambulance helicopter
No out of pocket cost for any ambulance, helicopter, any of the hospital stays or his prescribed medicine which is gets everyday
Neither have I lost any income over this
At the moment I get paid a full salary (same as I got when I worked) from the government as he can not go to child care at the moment due to risk of (any) infections
Can some things be improved about our healthcare system
Sure
Am I happy with it overall
Very much so
Greetings from Norway
It's harder getting access to the newest within medical research
You're kind of stuck with the standard treatments, so whatever new breakthroughs within medical science may not be available to you
It's still worth it though in my case, as I was born with a heart defect and went through open heart surgery as a newborn
Without universial healthcare, this would have been really costly for my parents
Although the doctors I've had through the years have been great, there are drawbacks such as things they just never told me about my condition, that I had to find out on my own by reading about it or talking to other people with cognital heart defects
I don't know if the same would have happened if I had private healthcare
Like I said though, it's still worth it
Any drawbacks are minimal compared to the money my parents would have to pay for my surgery
Well yeah you're gonna have to pay for other people's Healthcare
And a fact not much discussed, is that the people who need the most healthcare, is not the ones contributing the most
Chronically ill people who don't work for example
Me personally have no problem with this, but I could understand if some would
In Norway we also have things like sex-altering surgery on pretty young people, and gastro surgery sewing the stomach up so fat people can't eat as much
Both those things could be discussed if should be covered imo, when dental isn't.
Yeah please don't go to the emergency response unless it is an emergency
If you have injured your shoulder, and have to wait 2 months for the surgery - will you then get paid sick leave in Finland while waiting for the surgery
> Slightly higher taxes
Well, in the US they pay about double the taxes towards healthcare compared to Spain
[(Numbers are adjusted to purchasing power
)] Edit: Dark green is taxes
Light green is private cost
The countries I know of using health insurance instead of "government insurance" are the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany
But there could be more countries I'm not aware of
Its free, or almost free, at the point of use
Same as the police and fire service
Isn't there a court case going on as we speak about the opioids epidemic
As a person who's dad died of a heartattack (the 6th one, no less) i'd consider all kinds of immediate chest pains an emergency, and it seems the ambulance personell agreed with you on that
The truth though is that someone comes first no matter what
In a private system they'll just be ordered by ability to pay rather than severity of the case
> as if I didn't wait 3 hours in an ER for my broken ankle, or 4 days to see my family doctor, or 8 months for a "new patient appointment" at a new family practice
As a comparison I have never waited longer than 30 min in ER, 2 days to see my family doctor (I get to see one of her colleges if its urgent and I need a same day appointment)
(Norway)
What the US has going for it though is cancer treatment
You have the highest survival rates in the world
Ok, so if you can't work then you get paid sick leave
My point was that European waiting times for surgery has a lot less negative financial consequences than in the US
In the US you might have to wait only 2 weeks for your surgery, but you loose 2 weeks + 2 weeks recovery time of income
I though they didn't, but that the government sponsor low income people so all citizens can afford healthcare insurance
But I could be wrong
This was last year:
But googling the subject there seems to be more lawsuits going on
If people are discouraged from visiting a doctor because of their economic situation then that's also a way of putting others first
> I see here people saying that in the US some people is afraid to get a diagnose
Wouldn't this lead to a lower detection rate
I'm not sure
Wouldn't the cause of death still be cancer
True for some countries, but where I live we both [smoke] and [drink] less than in the US
(I live in Norway)
Will you still get paid if your boss says you are too injured to do your job
Over here it would be illegal to not pay
Dutch
First it sounds norwegian, then it sounds german
Then again it sounds english
I think it’s cool though, but it screws with my brain
Whatever they speak in the netherlands, I won't say anything about finnish, (please dont stab me)
Im Norwegian and Danish is most likely made up by a mad man with a potato in his throat
Danish is basically norwegian but very drunk
Took me, a Norwegian, longer to learn counting in Danish than French
So true-
Once we were in Copenhagen (you have no idea how close i was to writing København) and my mom went down into the lobby of our hotel to ask if we had to pay separately for wifi for the PC
So she goes up to the person by the desk as says:
"Må vi betale seperat for wifi til PCen" (Do we have to pay separately for wifi for the PC
The person looked confused at her, "P... C? ?"
My mom not getting it, repeated, "Ja, PC" (Yes, PC)
This goes on for a little until my dad jumps in and proudly says "Com-piu-dah" (Computer)
And the person immediately understood and was like "åhhhh
Computa"
My mom still gets annoyed whenever this story gets brought up haha
The billion ...diacritical marks (') makes it much harder, despite also being phonetic if you pay close attention
It goes well with how Kiss is a popular surname
The Viking ages
It's an important part of my country's history
But I might not be the one to blame, the Vikings didn't exactly document a lot of things
Well at least Norway did a ton of trade, mostly with the hanseatic leage (German traders)
But we sold a shitton of dry cod to other european countrys because of all the fasting time under the catholic church (I am guessing also under the protestant church, based on the hanseatic)
I am taking a masters in archaeology, and I am going to specialize in the middle ages
But a funfact, this also lead to more equality between women and men compared to other countrys, because women were at home running the farm, while the men were out fishing
Which lead to a good amount of farms being owned by women
Note: some schools have different schedules, because they have different lines or are just different
But at my high school it goes like this:
School starts at 8:15
Each class is 1h 35min long, with 5min break in the middle
min breake between classes
45min lunch(Friday’s has only 30min)
When school ends completely depends on the person and what grade you are in
I know some people who only have one class some days, they start at 11:20, and done by 14:00
But that means they have longer days other days
At my school last class is from 14:05 to 15:40
So that is the latest you are finished
When you are in 2nd or 3rd grade of high school it is common to have free periods, meaning just an open space in you schedule
They also depends upon the person, but for me, I have 2 that both combine with lunch, meaning I have 2h 25min break 2 times a week
That is just high school
Middle school and primary schools have completely different schedules, and most schedules vary by school
Edit: Also wanted to add, there is no school buses(unless you have physical issues) to take you to school
So you rely only on public transportation
In my high school classes usually started 8:00
One lesson is 45 min, but they were usually combined into 2, 3 or even 5 lesson periods with the same subject/course
15 minute break at 9:30-9:45, lunch usually at 11:15-12:00 or 12:00-12:45, and then a last break at 13:30-13:45 before the last lesson from 13:45 to 14:30 or 15:15
I usually had one day a week where I went home by lunchtime because of the way courses were planned
(4 time slots for subjects, 5 lessons a week each, but you only had 3 courses
This way I had 5 empty lessons every week)
School starts at 08:30 and ends 13:30 from 1st-4th grade and 08:30 and ends 14:30 for 5th grade and up
The break and so on is diffrent from school to school
I have school children and their day looks like this: School starts 08:45
One lesson lasts 45 minutes, and then usually 15 min break (out and play)
Lunch 11:30, packed lunch eaten in the classroom with milk (which they get at school)
The teacher might read a book for them while they eat
Done at school at sometime between 12:30 and 14:15 depending on how old they are, and which day it is
Many children below the age of 11 will stay at school until their parents are done at work in an after school program
(Mine never did)
My lessons were 45 minutes each :D (Norway
I would get up around 07:40 and get ready for the day (eat breakfast, get dressed, pack food)
I would leave my house around 08:30 - 08:40
School would start at 09:00
We would have two classes right after each other, a 15 minute break, one more class, food break that lasted for 30 minutes
After "food-time" (lmao) we would have another set of two classes right after each other, another 15 minute break and then one last class
School would be done at 14:30 and basically everyone went home
(Some had to stay back for extracurricular things or just had to work on something longer than expected)
I loved thursdays cause on thursdays the first three classes we would have food-class and eat what we made in "food-time", double gym class after food-break and then math in the last class
I work in primary school, but with special ed kids who are not in normal classes (forsterket avdeling)
Their day starts at 8
30 am and lasts until either 1 or 2 pm
We don't have traditional breaks, so I can't speak to that
I don't think any of the normal school days at our school lasts much longer than 2
15 pm
I dont know where in Norway you live PR which «linje» you’re studying
But I have 45-50 minute long classes then a 5 minute break between each class
Then we have a 20 minute break from 09:50 to 10:10 and then a 30 minute break from 11:45 to 12:15 and school is finished 14:45
The Norwegian butter crises od 2011
We had an aweful year  of horrible weather so our life stock didnt produce as much butter as usual
So when christmas came around and ever woman above 30 was going to bake for the holiday, they didnt have butter
We had to import butter from Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Netherlands
Funniest shit was that a couple of Poles was arrested at the Swedish-Norwegian border, trying to smuggle in alot of butter to sell on the black market
Roald Amundsen had planned a voyage to be the first to reach the north pole
Before he left two other guys claimed to have reached it first
Despite having raised money for the voyage to the north pole from both the royal family and parliament
He had also lent the ship from his idol, Nansen, on the pretense that he did not use it for some sort of race, rather than the voyage was for the sake of science
Anyways Amundsen didn’t care, the north pole was old news, the south was the future, but he could not just say that and contradict all these other things he had said, and so he just lied
He lied to the royals, parliament, his idol, and the country at large, he even lied to his fucking crew, the people going with him
He only told his brother and the guy steering the ship
In the end, it was alright
He reached the south pole on the fourteenth of December 1911, a little while before the second guy, Scott would reach the pole
He returned home and has been a Norwegian folk hero since
May 17th, it's our national day and it's a holiday where everybody put on their nice bunad or dress and go out the whole day
Kids are the main focus, and parades are arranged with flags everywhere and lots of games for kids in the afternoon
The amount of soft ice, hotdogs and helium balloons sold that day probably outnumbers the rest of the year combined
Young adults often gather in groups and have champagne breakfast and enjoy a few pints in the sun while watching the parades
Of course, this was not the same last year and won't be this year due to Corona
We have have waffle day and we make waffles on that day
They're often very good
May 17, Constitution Day, without a doubt
If you've been in Norway on any other day and don't know about May 17, you'd think the entire country went completely mad
Everyone is in the streets celebrating from early morning to late evening, and everyone wears their best clothes
It's pretty much a faux pas to go outside unless you're dressed in your finest
I highly recommend visiting Norway on that day for this reason, just don't expect to easily find a place to sit down and eat
And obviously wait until Covid is gone
I would say Constitution day on 17th of May
We all dress up in our best clothes (more than half of us in national costumes), carry a flag, walk in parades, watch parades, eat lots of ice cream, the children play and take part in different things where they can win little prices, then many end the day with a barbeque in the evening
Sadly the pandemic is putting a damper on the celebration this year and last, but next year we will be back
Easy
Constitution Day - May 17th
The entire country participates in traditional celebrations from morning till midnight - a tradition that goes back till the 1830s.
The amounts of ice cream I consumed as a kid each may 17th was insane
Without a doubt the best day of the year
There's something about thousands of tipsy people walking around the city in traditional garments waving flags
Sytten mai is forever and always the best day
Springtime, food, nice clothes, marching bands and happy people
It’s originally a Swedish tradition
The 25th of march is called “Maria Bebådelsedag” (the day Mary found out she was pregnant with a certain baby) also known as “Vårfrudagen”. Vårfrudagen somehow got translated to våffeldagen (the waffle day) by the people
So the Swedes started eating waffles that day
The Norwegians got jealous and decided to adopt the waffle day in Norway as well
On the 24th, thats when we open presents
Only thing I do on the 25th is eat christmas food
There are probably alot of traditions connected to the 25th, 26th and so on
But I dont know many who celebrate this
The main celebration is on the 24th, thats when we open presenst and eat
The 23rd we eat porridge and sees who gets the almond, mostly with exdended family, and we go out and give a bowl of porride to the Fjøsnisse (a sort of spirit who lives in barns and makes sure the animals are all right, but only if you give them the porrige)
The 25th we eat breakfast with extended family
Same as in Sweden, on the 24th, celebrated with close family
The 25th is often used for a family party with some (or all) of the extended family
In my family its pretty common to eat porrige on the 23rd, and give a plate to the Fjøsnisse
That's exactly what we do in my family
We don't go to church but we visit the graves of our family and light some candles
Santa would visit when us kids were 0-6 ish years old and we'd put out a plate of porridge for him
Yeah we do the same, eat porridge with an almond in
I do eat it, not on christmas, I just eat it whenever I feel like it
People still make it from scratch, maybe not very common though, they sell them at stores as well
You can have a lot of things in it
Butter with sugar, or with sugar and cinnamon, or brown cheese
On 17th of may, where I live, there are usually multiple old women sellinge lefse
It gets a bit more difficult separating Swedes and Danes from Norwegians, but I’ll try and find a picture
[This guy] is about as stereotypical norwegian I could find
There's also [this] fake colour image of Fridtjof Nansen, but it's hard to say how true to life it is
That pinkish streak from cheek to cheek is a trait I see a lot among relatives, acquaintances and neighbours
The way English people shape their mouth when they talk makes me instantly recognize them
It's like a circle
Funny thing: when I was in Italia and took the train from Venezia to Bologna, I wound up next to a couple  that spoke I'm guessing was Catalan to each (not familiar enough to be certain, but it did sound similar to Spanish while clearly NOT being Spanish, so it was an educated guess)
The dude looked a lot like a younger version of the man from southern Catalonia, but the woman was a pale, blue-eyed, light blonde that wouldn't have stood out in Sweden
Same in Norway
Germans and Dutch tourists keep falling down steep places or get dangerously close to wildlife
I should add that I know basic Italian, so I'm certain it was not one of their dialects
Also remember that she used a phrase that sounded close to "per bajkar". Did some digging and discovered that the word might have been "baixar", which can apparently be used to mean "get off" or "alight".
Pulpit rock, Lofoten Islands or maybe Vigeland statue park in Oslo
Not sure which one is the top, but those are the most famous ones I could think of
Norway is so long that there are different types of tourists visiting
Those who want to visit cities and the urban life usually go to Oslo or Bergen
Those who want to experience the nature usually go to places like Lofoten, Prekestolen, Geirangerfjorden and a whole lot of other places that the other Norwegians here commented
One very popular spot you will almost never be able to enjoy alone during tourist season: Preikestolen
Karl Johans gate which runs from the royal palace to the central station is absolutely packed in summer and christmas
I think more people should visit Istria
I’ve been there a couple of times (mostly in Umag), and I absolutely loved it
I guess the Alps get lots of tourists too
What makes Heidelberg a big touristy place
Bryggen (the old Hanseatic wharf) in Bergen belongs on this list for sure
Filled to the brim throughout the summer months
You forgot our roads
Feel like I end up behind a German caravan driving 20 km/h below the speed limit every time I drive along a narrow road
Norwegian tourism in general has exploded the last ten years or so
More like 15-20 years ago, about the time where the 40+ learned to make decent home pages
Nah, Lofoten has been a huge tourist attraction for years and years
At least more than "a few"
Yeah, but what are some tourist attractions there
I've never heard of it outside that I know a guy from there
Yeah, I'd know which country both Minnesota and Kent is in
If you ask us to name all 50 states we probably won't be able to do that, but Imran, even Ross couldn't all though he had all of Thanksgiving
I think most people will know where the "big ones" like Texas, Florida, New York, Alaska and California are located
Even though I can't locate North and South Dakota on the map I know that they are states in the US
I couldn't tell you most of the state capitals, but I can point out most of the states on the map
Always seem to fuck up the midwest though
People should be familiar with the common ones
I personally can point them all out on a map but that's just me
Here’s my attempt at naming them all:
Texas, California, New York, New Jersey, Florida, Washington, Nevada, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio, Alaska, Hawaii, Georgia, New England maybe
, Iowa, Alabama, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, 23/50
Please correct me if I Invented a state that doesn’t exist
I can only speak for myself
I know about pretty much every state but i have almost no clue about state capitols except Tallahassee, Albany, Trenton and Sacramento
Knowing there is a state called Minnesota doesn't mean they can point it out on a map
(Like most Americans know there is a country called Hungary
But might not know exactly where it is located in Europe
>Yes, I think I could probably name them all, given enough time
I challenge you to complete this
Oh man, I thought North Dakota was east of South Dakota
Well, I'm not surprised they didn't know *where* it was
> also has its own regions
Well, Hungary is the same size as Indiana
Aaah, sorta like Sweden then
> which might actually surprise some people
You could be right
Å tisse på stolen -To pee on the chair
Å stole på tissen - To trust your penis/vulva
Norwegian - Jeg må alltid rape etter middag
English - After dinner i always have to rape (burp)
Just try Tibetan
I had a lot of trouble with German when I had it as my mandatory third language in "junior high" (it was either that or French)
The grammar is nasty and I never really "got it" on an intuitive level - that insecurity tripped me up a lot, and I never really managed to immerse myself in the language
I think that if I had a convincing reason to, I could do much better now, though
I know myself and my own mind a lot better, I've picked up some useful background info in linguistics, and I would probably have an easier time with immersion, as well
When I was in college, I was bored stiff, and decided that I actually did miss languages in general
German wasn't all that tempting, so I decided to indulge my inner weeaboo and study Japanese on my own instead
It's not what I'd call easy to learn, but immersion was a bit easier
I haven't been making any real effort for several years now, but I'm competent enough to be able to read manga and things like that, and understand quite a bit of spoken Japanese
My writing and speaking skills are terrible, because I haven't practiced those too much
I might actually be going to Japan in a while, which means I can find out exactly *how* terrible
I haven't studied a lot, but Czech and Croation were a bit tricky
Probably only dutch would be easier
In Norway you can choose between Spanish, French and German in middle school
Then in high school you can choose to continue the language of your choice or take German
German is without a doubt considered the easiest language
Norwegian is pretty similar to Swedish so, that is why I am commenting
Buffalo Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo
I've tried to learn some Greek, and the alphabet doesn't seem too hard
Tibetan or Georgian
My school only has German and Spanish
Enig
They are pretty similar if you compare it to languages that are not in the same group
It's more complicated grammatically than swedish and norwegian, but that's true for a ton of languages
Deutsch ist kein problem mein freund
And I don't speak Icelandic
No, I'm glad I live in Europe
Le sad EFTA noises
I don't
I don't and would not have it any other way honestly
No, I'm pretty content without it, and would actually like less involvement and fewer directives please
WHAT
You've never visited Norway
I don't know ask a german
Yes
Join us
he's a fool
I suppose it is
We arent in the EU tho
Me in particular
It's more in general, but there's a few
Now before christmas one thing that's bothered me is that my neighbour can legally butcher his sheep and eat them
But if I want to buy even just a leg of it to cure into a ham, we have send the animal tens of kilometers to a butcher to have it done "humanely" and "safely". As if an animal transport is that
And I'm lucky to have a slaughterhouse that close
I can't really afford it either
It's more about stuff that's affected people I know or the community though
From serious issues lile privatizing the railway, to less serious but angering rulings like banning harpoon fishing at night or while wearing oxygen tanks
And then there's the just stupid rules like how we have to give ecologically farmed fish homeopathy as a first line of medicine
I mean wtf
And thank goodness for that
Tourist season is crowded enough I guess
It was pretend surprised
They have hubs in Oslo and Copenhagen as well
Urgh if I have to hear one more person complain about ‘radiation’ from signal towers / phones / WiFi routers I’ll lose my dick
I can't really think of any in particular
Homeopathy exists but I personal don't know anyone believing in it
There are hardly any (if any at all) flat earthers, Scientologists
Anti-vaxers are a small minority
That is not to say that crazy "truths" don't exist here
One example is a small church in Sweden where one of the ladies were announced to be the "bride of Christ". The story about this cult includes sexual abuse, physical abuse, slavery, shunning, deciding which married couple were allowed to have sex, the bride of Christ getting everyone's gold and lots of money, and also murder
([More info here] )
If something that crazy can happen in Sweden it can most definitely happen here as well
A lot of people talk about “secret islamization” of the nation, which means they are very concerned that Norway will become overtaken by muslims
It’s not a conspiracy theory unique to Norway, but that’s the one of the two that comes to mind
The other one is the climate change deniers
We got this black drink in this country, sometimes it contains sweetener, sometimes sugar
People drink it often, some people probably every day, even tho it don't do anything "good" except taste good
I think it's called Pepsi or coca-cola
Tell me about it :/ I rented a apartment that was owned by a old jehovas vitne lady
She was "allergic" to wifi, but lived in the city and had a cellphone with wifi and instagram
I was 22 and she would turn the wifi off if as she pleased if I "made to mutch noice". I told her she should be thankful that she had an young person who newer has a party or play loud music, we are difficult to find
Then I got myself a wireless wifi and she trew me out since I had wifi
And I refused to act as her personal carer
But I wanted to move from there anyway
She just wanted a no wifi hermit that PAIED to live there and take care of her
People believe this here
I've never heard of any of that
Of course 2020 will be a shitty year, cuz: ww3, Australia on fire, coronavirus and all other conflicts in the world
Jesus Christ some people are just assholes and hide behind religious as some excuse
My ex GF was also supposedly allergic to radiation
She made me put the WiFi in the back of the flat as far away from her as possible, so the signal was shit
I bought a cheap spare router and left it turned off in the back then hid a new one in a shoe box in the living room
Signal was great and she couldn’t tell the difference
I remember seeing something on NRK about a new antenna causing a (tiny) riot in one of our numerous counties years back
That was about it
I met one anti-vax feminist on a party once, and had a blast trying to figure out how her world worked
She got all kinds of pissed, but stuck through my torment
I don't know
I've only seen a documentary (in Swedish) myself
> Despite what you read on reddit, those people are usually otherwise completely fine
That's what people say in this thread too though
Otherwise sane people can in one turn go full bullshit mode
So true
Oh yes, im shure she avoided the wifi that way
Its not like every other house has wifi, the tv, pc or cellphone has wifi
Great idea
Its wierd though, the people who think you can be allergic to wifi
And try to force everyone else to live by their no wifi rules
That is hysterical
Good luck forcing that bill trough
What a wierdo
isn't that what a lot of politicians do
This sounds like a movie plot :/
I can't even imagine how scary it would be to come back from a war with nothing just to find out that you are completely alone in a destroyed country
Like, where do you start
How do you get food and water
I mean, this story is something not even Spielberg could've written
In norway we have two wikipedias, bokmål and nynorsk
I use them before the English version if i can
English is preferable, however I always check in Swedish or Danish as well if the Norwegian or English wiki doesn't have as much info as I'm looking for
Same
I usually end up with bokmål though
Sometimes I switch to danish/swedish if the Norwegian one doesn't have alot, and then I might look it up in English lol
Yes
Why would you spend money on water when you've got better water in your tap
Yes, not drinking tap water is unheard of
The only reason to buy bottled water is if you’re in need of a bottle
If you already have something to drink out of, it’s normal to just fill it up with tap water (from anywhere, including places like public restrooms in gas stations)
Fun fact: The “exclusive” and expensive Voss water, which can be bought all over the world, is just Norwegian tap water
It doesn’t have a special taste for me while in Norway, but whenever I’ve been out of the country for a while, a bottle of Voss water tastes like the best, most refreshing water ever
But I guess I’m biased ;)
Not drinking it is unormal here, very few people actually buy water, recently in the municiplaty where I live the water got poisoned so that was one expection, but we just boiled our water
It’s probably better than Voss as well
Huh, I didn’t know that
Interesting
I’ve never tried Voss water in the US, but I wonder if I’d notice the difference
Toll’s, they are everywhere and is so expensive
And the roads are preatty bad to, holes and bumps everywhere makes it hard to drive
Is this because someone in the government or the local authorities is a friend with someone who runs a pole production company
I think someone here on Reddit wrote about it a while ago
My guess is that all those children have food to eat, a roof over their head, and they all have access to education and health care
They just can't go on holiday abroad, or get expensive shoes, and they ride a second hand bike
Poverty in Europe usually looks very different to the rest of the world (the exception might be some gypsy communities in southern Europe)
> "wild parking"
Do people respond with "wild keying"?
I wish this was how the discussion would be framed more often
I'm so sick of hearing racists blame it all on the immigrants, their religion, culture or whatever instead of realizing that many of them are basically made to live in poorer neighborhoods relative to the rest of the population and don't get a fair chance at integration
It's mostly alcohol-related, isn't it
i did that lol
the fact that our roads so consistently are complete garbage continues to baffle me
Immigrants of europe, what expectations did you have before moving there, and what turned out not to be true
I was born here in Europe so I can't answer this, but I just had to mention this
We've had like a few hours of snow this year in Oslo
Constant 4 to 7 degrees
This isn't how winter is supposed to be
Duisburg for me, but tbf I only know the likes of Malaga and Poznan because I have heard of football teams from there
Poland, Romania and Bulgaria are considered Eastern Europe if you lived before the Soviet Union and the Iron curtain fell
And they certainly are if you say Eastern Europe because of history and culture
The only reason why it geographically is not quite right is because of Russia
And culturally it is stranger that Russia is considered European than Poland, Romania and Bulgaria are considered parts of Eastern Europe
Oh, so you say you like football
Name all the host cities of the European championship then
Most definitions have Switzerland as a central European country too though
It's always been more about history and politics than pure geography
osen just means "the bag" in Norwegian
Not that menacing
Don’t, its useless
Even if you learn the language you won’t understand what people from most parts of Norway say, we have so many dialects that we can’t even count them
so you’ll probably do well in Oslo you won’t understand most words in Trondheim or Stavanger
I’m not gonna argue that its not beautiful or anything, but its useless
5 million people speak it, 15 more can understand you
Its better to learn Spanish, Russian, German and Italian
Only reason to learn it would be if you moved here, or
if you are obsessed with Norway or smt
Not Scandinavians
Technically there isn’t an official language in the US
English is the most spoken language, but they haven’t actually made it the official language of the country
To be fair, he said healthier and not healthy
Same in Norway, but our languages are pretty much the same so
I definitely agree with you
Much of European institutional traditions making up huge and important aspects of society undoubtedly primarily stem from ancient Rome and Greece
True, they were, so I don't want to say we are similar, but many of our shared institutions have their foundations in those civilizations, so it is a shared trait in most of Europe
Something more obvious to have in common is the influence of the renaissance, which in turn was inspired by the civilizations of antiquity
Norway:
I usually got seasick when on a boat and after being sick she (or anyone) would ask "Have you fed the crabs
If going for a walk mum might say: out for a walk, never mad(ut på tur, aldri sur)
If it was raining she would say: There is no such thing as bad weather only the wrong clothing(Det fins ikke dårlig vær bare dårlig klær)
This I think was quite common for anyone my age and up who wasn't finishing their food: Eat your food, think about the starving children in Africa
Or if I tried to have a lie in: get up you can't sleep away your whole day
If you stand in front of the TV: Are you the son of a glassmaster
French moms are shitty, man
What's the issue with yawning
Letting the heat in Norway is "We don't heat for the crows"
To that we say "did you bring a dog
"This looks like a pigsty" - mom
"This looks like a bombed whorewhouse" -dad
In Norway, the licorice candy «Skipper’s Pipes» were banned from sale in 2010 because the shape resemble a tobacco product
You could buy them in the duty free shops at airports, but they could only be on display in the tobacco room in the back
And could only be sold to people over 18
As of 2017 the ban was lifted, but it is still illegal to advertise this product
Obviously, the ban made this particular candy more popular than ever
Well it's illegal to "die" in Svalbard due to the permafrost, It's not really illegal but Your body can't be buried there, the body have to be shipped to the mainland (i don't know if this is exactly true so if you know tell me
Edit: there were some typos
Norway here
There are some weird laws on Svalbard, but all are understandable and enforced
1) You are not allowed to die on Svalbard
(Nobody will bury you, because of the permafrost, and older people or seriously sick people are transported away from Svalbard because of this)
2) You are not allowed to have a cat on Svalbard
(They are considered a serious threat against the ecosystem)
3) You are not allowed to go to an uninhabitated area without a rifle
(Polar bears are not very friendly animals)
It's illegal to use a lawn mover on Sundays and public holidays
This to give neighbours some peace and relaxation on these days
Police may enforce this law by giving warnings and fines
That is a strange one
A pub without a dance permission must also stop their guests if they make «spontaneous dance-like moves», as it is classified as dancing
LOVE the noise laws
Norway has had the same arrangement for ages on radios and TVs, a “Broadcasting license” to be paid twice a year for every household which has a TV
Since it’s very old fashioned compared to today’s media habits it’s to be adopted into a new tax to be paid per person, nevertheless how little states TV you watch or radio you listen, even own a TV or not
Well that's cool, i heard about it on youtube and nrk (idk why but i have a wierd obsession with searching up things about my own country and russia)
As long as you're not enjoying it
Is y not a vocal
Oh my god I'm so jealous
We have two written languages and neither are phonetically written
It's dumb because the whole point of latin script is to have phonetic representation
Then we imported it to a bunch of other languages with different sounds and didn't bother to change much of anything first
It's easier than danish though, which is something
Even if you're trying to speak "normert bokmål" or something like that you'll still do deg ->  "dei", jeg -> "jei", etc
It does work well enough in Nynorsk, on the condition that you know a fair bit about sound changes in the person's dialect and spelling since Old Norse
Most don't though, so it isn't that applicable
*"Yes* /2hɑːɽ/ *is spelled "herda" because it's from Old Norse herða and your dialect as an* /e/ > /ɑ/ *change before <rð>, which becomes /ɽ/, and the ending drops because of the double consonant"*
Written Norwegian is complicated
I am no expert, and this is just how I understand it
Our written languages is based on Danish, updated a few times, some pronunciations have drastically changed and never been updated, I think many of us used to have more consonants, a more "hard" language
Some G's hare hard, some are combined like "gj" to make just a "j" sound, and some are just straight up "j". I also think the written language has changed many dialects, dialects used to be frowned upon
Many of us with dialects writes phonetically among friends and people we have a casual relationship with
I like to base it on the structure of nynorsk, otherwise it would be wild
It's a mess
Nynorsk is almost only used in the west of Norway
Even thought it’s taught in school, most of Norway never have any proper exposure to it except for those in the west
I can also say with confidence that even people here struggle with not knowing the spelling and sometimes (extremely many times) whole words as well
Many words are completely unknown to most people
Do you hear Norse often
Or did you mean Norwegian
Theres a lot of silent letters, mostly at the beginning of words
Often a "h" in front of "v" if its the first letter like in "hvor" or "hvem" (where, who)
Well that one's easy, just say "samf"!
One based on the Danish we had used in the union for a long time already, the other created in the 1800s based on certain dialects
The former is used by about 90%, the latter by ~10%.
Non-native who's studied English at a university level
The problem is that latin script is invented to represent the sounds of the latin language
English has different sounds, but decided to just use the same alphabet without changing anything to accomodate for this
So whenever you're learning a foreign language and you think "hey why do they have all these extra letters like Ø?"
The answer is because of having some goddamn sense
**The most common vowel in the entire English language does not have it's own letter
** You can only imagine how frustrating this is to learn
The sound represented by *a* in *about* is the same one that is represented by *i* in *pencil* or  *u* in *supply*. Hell, sometimes it's not even represented by anything, as in whatever's supposed to be between *th* and *m* in *rhythm*.
That’s what I thought
Norse is just as much a precursor language for Danish and Swedish as it is for Norwegian
They both use three, but in Bokmål you can drop the female gender if you want and use the common gender (ie the male one)
The only place where they exclusively speak with only two genders is Bergen (they have a very distinct dialect influenced by the fact that the city was part of the Hanseatic League back in the day)
If you use the common gender more, you're using what is called Riksmål, a more conservative branch of Bokmål. It's very rare to see written material without the female gender at all though, or at least female conjugations in certain words
Standard American English

Make sure you select American from the drop-down menu
Google didn't have "supply", but I found a youtube video
[About]
[Rhythm]
[Pencil]
[Supply]
If you're having trouble maybe you're stressing the vowel since you're looking for it
The schwa sound is almost always unstressed in English
Sorry, I know that it's April Fool's day, but I don't get this joke
Please explain
EDIT: Ok I googled it
Apparently in some English speaking countries, elementary school children are taught that A', 'E', 'I', 'O' and 'U' are the only vowels
This is incredibly wrong, as like I tried to say in my original comment - a vowel is a term of phonetics, not of writing
It's a convenient lie teachers tell children to help them learn how to write, but it is not something you should believe as an adult
Rhythm actually has two vowels
/ˈrɪð(ə)m/
ɪ and ə are vowels
You mean how it's pronounced
Like the "u" in "fur" or the "e" in "service", as spoken by a generic American
I edited my comment  probably the same time you wrote this
I googled it

It's a convenient lie teachers tell children to help them learn how to write, but it is not something you should believe as an adult
Rhythm actually has two vowels
You can see it written in IPA (not the beverage, the [international phonetic alphabet] You see it in dictionaries next to words to indicate the pronunciation) like so:  /ˈrɪð(ə)m/
ɪ and ə are vowels
ə is called [schwa] and is the most common vowel in the English language
EDIT: Speaking of things you teach children that is wrong, this old rule: "i before e, except after c". This is true for common words like believe, receive and deceive
This is useful for children to learn because at an elementary school level, this holds true for most words they will write
However there are so many exceptions to this "rule" that it's absurd to consider it a rule at all
I before E? What about *seize, caffeine, leisure, weird, rottweiler, either, neither, atheist, vein*?
Or even if there's a C, what about *species, policies, science*?
Is it the same in Estonian
> I think English would look very different if schwa had a letter assigned to it lol
I think English wəd look very difərənt if schwa had ə lettər əsigned tə it lol
Ok so "would" and "to" really depends on the dialect here but you get what I mean
In Norway we have different (written) vowels and in elementary school in Norway we learned it like this:
*A vowel is a sound you can hold indefinetly
* Like you can say AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA but you cant say  KKKKKKKKKKKK
It's not correct either but I feel like it's closer
"På ramma" - "On the frame", as in sitting on the edge/frame
A colleague of mine refers to it as having a framework agreement (jeg har en rammeavtale)
We sometimes call it the office, and say we're going there to do some paperwork
"Doing some paperwork"
My name is usually sufficient
It has all the hard stuff to pronounce from Norwegian
"Ibsens ripsbusker og andre buskevekster"
"(Henrik) Ibsens currant bushes and other bushes"
Is a common tounge-twister in Norway, I don't know if its particulary hard to pronounce for foreigners but saying it fast is almost impossible (for me)
Other than that I've heard from some americans that the ø can be hard to get right
Works like a free visa
It's time to link the youtube video again
The colloquial word for friend is "kompis", and we can address each other that way too
Not quite sure what it means - compadre maybe
Our crew is called "gutta" (the boys), if they're boys at least
I do know of one set of girls that call themselves "gutta" too
Jentene, guttene, gjengen (the girls, the boys, the "gang")
But mostly we use their first names
Kis - "Dude", exists in different dialect variations
But is kinda used more in the Trøndelag area afaik
I guess one could use "kompis" ("(male) friend") or "gutta" ("guys"), but you're right that the most common is just to use people's names
Does
tøser mean the same as in Norwegian
And by that I mean sluts
Same for Norway
I say bro/bror all the time to my friends
Tøs actually means "girl" in Norwegian as well, at least in Bergen
The local water park even named the girls' locker room "Småtøser". Most young people use the word in the slutty sense, though
Wallah broshan
Definitely doesn’t just mean girl here in Oslo
That’s probably the reason
It’s funny because I’ve never thought about tøs meaning just girl, but right after my last comment today I went to a local cafe where most of the servers are a bit older and I noticed they had “Te fra tøsene” on the menu
Weren't the Rus a Swedish people or something irl
Maybe that's where the story came from
I mean the [Kievan Rus] (I looked it up)
Apparently there's some disagreement on whether the name is Norse, Finnish, or Slavic, but some tribes from present-day Sweden seem to have been involved at least
I think that NASA built a satellite in the 90’s with two groups of engineers that used different systems
One group used the metric system and the other group used the imperial system
The result was that the satellite disappeared in space or something like that
There was a time where we had to go through border control to visit a lot of European countries
(I once spent 5 hours on the border between Germany and Poland
Which was fun
) But we could always freely travel between Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland
So it's odd to me that Canada and the US, which are sharing a border, have similar economy, and similar culture don't have a more open border
Do you know why that is
Good luck with the move
I think you will like the Netherlands
In Norway we have terminated the ancestor thing if you want I live here you would have a work visa on a job that requires a bachelor or higher or be a refugee
More people speak English in Norway than in Canada (89% vs 86%)
Skateboarding was illegal until 1989
The use of salmon in Sushi was introduced/suggested to Japan in the early 80s by us in order to export more of it
Norway is the only place you can still get the popular soda Urge
The first science fiction novel was written in 1741 by the Norwegian author Ludvig Holmberg
"Nils Klims underjordiske rejse" is a novel that actually challange gender roles, and other stuff as well
Obviusly it was made illegal though
That is like the equivalent of asking someone if they need help with the dishes just as they are finishing the last plate
Do you speak Manx by any chance
I visited Murmansk in the 90's. And people with HUGE fur coats were standing outside selling ice cream
Others were selling sunflower seeds (..or was that in Poland
If its any comfort, I have no idea what any of the colours in our flag means
Your nation is the birthplace of two of the world's best cyclists right now, Primoz Roglic and Tadej Pogacar
Of course we know about Slovenia :)
Edit; Peter Sagan is Slovak, and I'm an idiot
Choo choo
Your expectations are correct, we do not know how to wash dishes manually
That's why we never offer to do them until after they've been done (by swedes)
Ah, I see
First launched in Norway under the name Urge as a "test product", it quickly proved successful and popular, and it was expanded to other European countries
The success in Norway and Europe convinced Coca-Cola to launch in the U.S as well, under the name Surge
It sold well during the first few years, but numbers fell, and the product was pulled
As of now, Norway is the only country where you can buy this nectar of the gods
I wouldnt say it is similar to fanta
I dont quite remember the taste
I will buy one and return later
I’ve visited Kiruna overnight on holiday road trips, it’s interesting to see those mined up hills like giant stairways, and it’s generally a very quiet and slightly depressing place
Is really all that is considered a part of area of the city, a part of the city
Because I would not call a place that sparsely populated a city, that is if it is evenly distributed, which it obviously is not
> There was a similar plan for Norway
And NOW you tell us
Kiwi-Tinaa ️️️ alt skal grillast ️️
Wow TIL, I didn't know this
>I haven't seen supermarkets of the same kind as Kiwi or Joker around here (they feel more like big convenience stores or kiosks)
Kiwi and Joker is the same company as Meny - all are owned and run by *Norgesgruppen*. They are just differently labelled
Meny is bigger, Kiwi is smallish, and Joker is very small
We don't use the Euro in Norway, but we've phased out all coins that are smaller than 1 kr
The last one was phased out in 2012
Even the 1 kr coin is pretty useless, so maybe we'll get rid of that one too eventually
It's not as if he's on the 5 dollar bill or anything, lol
Nope, things will say "24,99" or whatever and they just round to the nearest round number
So 24,99 will be 25 kr
Here it's mixed groups according to age, outdoorsy and fun, but not very strict
We are Scandinavians after all
We also have sea-scouts here, where they spend a lot of their time out in boats, or in kajakk / canoe
And although they do learn a lot about safety at sea and so on, its mostly just for fun
They do exist in Spain
[Source]
But maybe just less widespread there
Very common in northern Europe
It's probably a bit down to culture
And I would also think the southern Europe heat would kind of put a damper on vigorous forest hiking
You're welcome
[Bli hos Meg (Stay with me) - Dina]
A song every single Norwegian 90s kid has had stuck in their brain since 2003
Complete with the era defining trance synth
This was the song you put on at the school disco just after awkwardly slowdancing to When you Say Nothing at All by Ronan Keating, and then finally could make use of the overload of sugar in your blood from drinking too much Fanta Exotic
I can feel my hair building up with cheap sticky hairgel again and turning spiky just as I'm listening to it now
This song is made for one group as part of the Russ celebrations we do at the end high school here in Norway
I normally despise this music (because of the lyrics and lazy songwriting), but this one we listened to a lot during my Russ celebrations and I kind of love it
The lyrics on this isn't that much better than the other songs, but at least it's not about getting girls super drunk in order to sleep with them
Like most of the others are
I remember this being popular in Norway when I was like 9 and it annoyed me as I couldn’t understand why he was talking about a boat he knows  (I associated talking boats with shit my annoying cousins was into)
This comment reminded me of [this] other *russ* song that was pretty controversial, with lyrics such as «er du 13 er du med» which means «if youre 13 youre coming with». the songs are about sex, alcohol and drugs
(Age of consent is 16 and alcohol is 18+ in Norway, russ are often 17-19)
This wildly different from the song I posted haha
I guess you Swedish have a more sensible way of celebrating than we have
Yeah most of them are pretty terrible if you ask me
Champagnegalopp looks more like the Russ celebrations we have
Though ours goes on for a month or so right before exams
Chances are I wouldn't enjoy your celebrations more than our haha
I would say "swedes are doodoo-heads", but we have a lot of swedes here too
Taco is to be eaten on Friday and we secretly crave hearing foreigners saying positive things about our country
Sweden sucks and Denmark like potatoes so much they stick'em down their throats
Derry Girls is fantastic
I really hope they continue making it
I agree, however the best teacher i ever had was a swede
Started watching “Twelve” on Netflix but it’s in Flemish
How similar are Dutch and Flemish language
Had to ask
As an outsider, I very much prefer potato or beef
Also, tacos are to be eaten in a lefse, not a hard shell, as per the rules of r/deterfredag
Ugh this is so true and it makes me a little uncomfortable
Sorry guys
Ok that's borderline something
Oh god reading this makes me cringe, but i know there are plenty of norwegians like that
Sorry on their behalf
I mean, Norway's cool but we're not THAT cool
And Scottish whisky is the best wth
Taco is a social meal thus perfect for Friday's
Alrighty
Thanks
No, but when I lived aboard for a year with a Norwegian friend, we sometimes realised we spoke English to each other when no one else was around
I've never had a problem with it, and hadn't really heard of it before Reddit
I pick up most of my packages at the post office/the grocery store
If theye small enough they're left in the mail box
I usually pick pacages up in the local store
Thieves arent a problem where I live anyways, so they could probably just leave it outside the door
Here in Norway it's more common that if the package you've ordered doesn't fit the mailbox and you're not home to pick it up at your door, it's left at a post office corner of your nearest store or gas station that has one
Sometimes there is a toll you have to pay for the package, if so, then the mailman can come to your door for you to sign and pay, if you aren't home, they're just going to deliver it to the store for you to pick up later
No, because packages aren't left unattended on porches
Why would that even be a thing
If I am not at home the delivery van will either try again the next day, or (more often) - deliver it at the nearest "post in shop". Or the package will be delivered directly there
So no package is ever left outside my door
(Post in shop is post office services located in a local food shop)
It's been a problem where I live and people are encouraged to have their packages sent to the local "post in shop". There have been a few incidents of thieves being caught red handed, where one of them had a cache of stolen items in his apartment
They just deliver them to the local post office (which for years have been in a grocery store), or on the seldom occasion I get something from DHL they call me and ask, I've gotten them to deliver it to my workplace instead since it was enroute
They would never leave it at the porch unless I said it was ok
Heard on the news some guy was arrested for having stolen packages from people's letterboxes in nov/Dec here in Norway, but I can't remember what city that was in
It don't think it happens that much though- I've lived in a few countries, and Norway is definitely the country I feel has the least crime petty or otherwise
> No, because no porch pirate would be able to wait long enough that Postnord delivered the package
That made me laugh so much
And I'm even happy with Postnord
Or maybe I have just adjusted my expectation as to how long it should take them to deliver
A friend of mine had a neighbor that kept stealing her packages out from the mailbox, so she had to order to the grocery store which was about half an hour away by car
> parcel machines
Tell us more
I disagree, I've had much better experience with Posten than Postnord
When that happens its time to put a lock on your postbox
Where do you live
We are starting to get these in Oslo
I've seen several similar machines
Postnord has many, and Posten/Bring have a few
Yes I definitely prefer Posten
Additionally, for many people it’s often easier to get packages from Posten, because Postnord pickup places can be further away
We are far behind you
Here we still use people for that
Looks nice
Especially singe you can pick it up outside opening hours
No, we are not that technically advanced
Here we still use people to deliver packages
> We are starting to get these in Oslo
Then I guess they will spread down here as well eventually
(I live on the countryside in the south)
I find Oslo less interesting than most capitals in Europe, but I wouldn't call it soulless though
It definitely has a soul
Halle in Germany
Was stuck there for two hours and it felt like they had just kept all the negatives from the cold war and no bright spots
I agree 100%. It has its moments Oslo, but compared to other big European cities/capitals it's depressingly gray
But I love little towns in East Germany
(Honestly I do
Favorite: Geithain
I have friends there
Kjede VS Skjede
Chain VS Vagina
Incredibly small pronunciation difference too, with mostly younger generations getting it wrong
The ability to distinguish clearly between our kj/ky/skj/sj sounds is deteriorating and we often use less “proper” words for vagina anyways, so they don’t even realise
[A letter of marque]
I dont really get many of those, but i have had someone try and speak sweedish with me, because they thought that danish is a lot like norwegian
They knew some danish thought it was sweedish and said that to a norwegian
Jeg hadde en kid som kom opp til meg og sa «så fint skjede du har»... jeg er en gutt og jeg hadde på meg en buff
Hva mener du med det
Isn't the pope basically the father of the church though
Well, without it, you'd be considered a pirate
Brukte normen det så mye da
It costs about 50 euro a semester at my university
But, most people take student loans to help pay for housing etc
We can apply for a student loan through a student bank
If you pass all your exams, and finish your bachelors/masters, then 40% of the loan will be turned into a stipend
So yes, we do get some money, but 60% of it is a loan, and it's only converted when you pass/finish your degree
I used to get a little over €10,000 each school year, from August to June (with monthly pay)
40% of that turned into a stipend and I had to pay back 60%.
I haven't calculated it very closely
We get just over 8000kr september-December and February-June, and about 20 000kr in August and January
You have to pay it off no matter what, but the student loan is the absolute best loan you can get here, so the fees are pretty small
You have to start paying it back the month or so after you're done with the degree
You can ask to start later but I'm not sure on what basis
Of course not, it's for Norwegian citizens
Others can get loans from their own countries
Really fancy wine
As the state monopoly controls sales, cheap alcohol is expensive, but it evens out for the really expensive ones
They aren't allowed to mark up the price a lot unlike most sellers
There have been many cases when they get in some rare wine and people sleep outside the store for days to get their hands on the few bottles
Romanée-Conti (2015) seems to have gone for 50k NOK here, but 200k as the cheapest option online
Diapers, appearantly
Many Russians (used to
) come here to hoard them
Ehm
Not much
I guess electricity prices are not too bad considering our level of income
And I remember some years ago when Russians kept coming over the border to buy diapers because the shops here were fighting over customers so the prices were ridiculously low
But in general - prices here are ok for people with an average salary or more
Also most Norwegians can afford to travel to other countries, due to lower prices almost everywhere else
Good healthcare
Fjords and shitty weather
same same
[Also, diapers]
Consumer electronics at least used to be a bit cheaper or as cheap before
I feel you
I've never been to Switzerland, unfortunately, but all other countries are cheaper . Maybe except for Iceland
I like the sound of thunder
Yes, but i don't want the lightning strikes to close
I remember when i was around 8 years old during a thunderstorm
I was looking out the window and suddently there was this huge flash and a big boom right after
I was home alone and it scared the fuck outta me
It shook the whole house and the house became dark
This was during the night and i couldn't find the candles
I was a mess lol
I do like thunder, and Tor is the first half of my first name
Happy cake day
Username checks out
One that immediately came to mind because my mother says it all the time is:
vegetable = Grønnsak (Green case (as in police case or court case))
We also call lightbulbs "pære" as in "pear" the fruit
Another famous thing my mother directly translates is the saying "høy på pæra" (high on the pear) which means to be arrogant
Languages don’t always make sense
Some of my favorites:
Hviterussland - White Russia - in English Belarus
Sommerfugl - Summer Bird - In English Butterfly
Marihøne - Mari Hen - in English Ladybug
Dovendyr - Tired Animal - Sloth
Morskake - Mother’s cake - placenta
Frankrike - Frank’s kingdom- in English France
Prærieulv - Dessert wolf - Coyote
Lastebil - Loading car - Trailer/Truck
Gravemaskin - Digging machine - Excavator
And many many more
Ooo yes
The butt troll
We have almost all of them
Racoon is washer bear in Norwegian too (but not the little part)
Goodbye in the bathroom you old choclate
Sak also means thing
= green thing
Light pear or glowing pear would be proper translation as pære is just shortened version of lyspære
Here’s one
Hageslange - garden snake - garden hose
What is the “correct” name
I am guessing that is in Belarusian maybe
Norwegian checking in
Well in that case, maybe it’s not as funny as I thought of it
Thank you for learning me something new
Hei, jeg heter John
Hyggelig å treffe deg
Hvor kommer du fra
Hi, I named John
Nice to meet/hit you
Where come you from
Hard to directly translate "heter" since English would use "I am named".
>Hi, my name is John, it's a pleasure to meet you
Where are you from
Hei, mitt navn er John, det er en hyggelighet å møte deg
Hvor er du fra
Very understandable
Only thing I would change is I would say "hyggelig å møte deg"
Hei
Eg heiter John
Hyggeleg å møte deg
Kor kjem du ifrå?
I am named John
Pleasant to meet you
Where come you from
Hi, my name is John, it's a pleasure to meet you
Where are you from
Norwegian: Hei, jeg heter John, det er en glede å møte deg
Hvor er du fra
Direct translation: Hi, I called John, it is a joy to meet you
Where are you from
Pleasure should be translsted to glede and not hyggelighet
That makes the sentence sound much better
Definitely, or just "Hei, jeg er X"
Polar bears
They're the largest species of bear, they're apex predators, they can often go hungry and they will hunt people for food
Fortunately, there aren't too many polar bear attacks here, mostly because Svalbard is the only place where they're found here, but there are news of attacks (often fatal) every few years
The polar bear
Although only present in Svalbard, the polar bear is responsible for several deaths the last decades
Statistically-speaking, far more dies from encounters with dogs or from horseback riding, but a polar bear is probably the predator you're least likely to survive a chance encounter with
- They're hypercarnovorious, meaning they'll only eat meat
-They are apex predators, which means that they have little instinctive fear
-They are curios and intelligent creatures
- They're the only known predator that is known to actively hunt humans
- They're the largest land predator in the world, weighing in on average 500-800 kg with specimens as large as 1000 kg recorded
- Their attack mode gives little chance of survival
They are prone to bite over your head and throw you around, snapping your neck
-They're incredible fast
-They are living in a very harsh climate, meaning they're almost always hungry
No other bear comes close in the level of dangerousness
On Svalbard it is definitely Polar Bears
On the mainland: People can die if they crash into a moose (elk) with their car
I think bacon kills even more people
And, of course, people
In Sweden it's Surströmming
Oh shit, I was thinking bears or elks, and totally forgot we have polar bears
Yeah, they are by far the most dangerous animal we have
The siberian tiger is present only in the Asian parts of Russia, isn't it
So technically it is not a European predator
But there are polar bear populations on part of European Russia, such as Novaya Zemjla and Franz Josef Island, I think
Lynx aren't dangerous, they are way too shy
Wolves might be dangerous, but they are primarily scavengers and only occasionally hunt
The only known fatality from wolves here in Norway dates from 28th of December 1800
A six year old girl was killed by wolves
For the last 220 years no other attacks are known
I think it's only kind of true
You're not required to own a gun, and if you're going outside of Longyearbyen, you're required to have means of scaring away a polar bear, such as a flare gun, and you are recommended to have a gun, but it's not required
Yes you do
Only in the Svalbard archipelago
So unless you go there you won't encounter them
Up there it's a serious threat though, in settlements you'll generally be fine but outside of the villages you are required to carry a firearm
Some resident up there was killed this year while sleeping in a tent I believe
Hmm do you have any sources for that
All the sources I find say that polar bears are the largest species of bear
>Plus, you got Rakfisk, which is essentially the same as surströmming
We don't keep it in tins, unfortunately, so it stinks up the whole house
I remember being nauseous all day when my parents were having friends over for rakfisk when I was younger
The wolf is a stray animal, and the population roams freely between Russia, Finland, Sweden and Norway
Between 1845 and 1971 the wolf was actively hunted in Norway, but never really gone since animals strayed from Eastern Scandinavia
But predators that's actively hunted tends to get more shy of people  than predators that's protected - something we see with polar bears on Svalbard these days
The actual number of wolves in the country the last 220 years or so is difficult to estimate, but there's always been a presence
Today the wolf is protected and there are designated parts of the country where it's allowed to roam, but in my opinion the species should be allowed in a far greater area and the current population should be expanded to a far bigger number
That would not only conserve nature, but create better conditions for other animal populations as well
According to the  official numbers there were 56 individuals last year
Total for the Scandinavian peninsula is approximately 450 individuals
There are far more in Finland, the Baltic countries and Russia
The official policy is that each year 4-6 litters should be born, keeping the population around current levels
If a wolf stray out of the designated areas it cannot be hunted freely, but the Environmental Department may give permission to specially licenced hunters to kill it if it becomes a nuance
Most farmers will claim the wolf damages their livestock, so unfortunately such permissions are given too often in my opinion

At deep winter exercise in Northern Norway we were heli-dropped into the middle of fucking nowhere
Absolutely desolate
Our squad's belt wagon driver drove the long way alone and arrived at our camp 48 hours later
We were organized in such a way that our portable crapper was placed in the trailer of the BV 206
One of my squad was in a hurry to be relieved, so he threw up the door, placed his HecklerKoch AG3 *outside* the door, went in and closed the door
Someone must've been watching him, because after a few minutes, the door was opened, he heard a rifle being loaded, then looked down the barrel of his AG3
Then a soldier with thick German dialect said: Next time, I shoot you with your own gun
Platoon 3, especially Bravo squad, I fucking miss you morons
Best guys ever
TIL: The people with the most fun in the army: Germans
I remember my uncle told this story from his conscription in the 80’s. He was a tank operator
One time during winter they were doing a joint operation with some regular soldiers
A bunch of heating tents and such were set up because it was fucking freezing out, and during some quiet period during the excerise, apparently some higher command dudes from both branches were stood outside a heating tent discussing some stuff
A friend of my uncle was an adjutant to their commanding officer and he mentioned that they, very fittingly, were on the topic of how lucky the tank operators were in this excercise because it must be nice and toasty in there
Except it wasn’t nice and toasty, it was fucking scaldingly hot for some reason i can’t quite remember
And my uncle was sat half-naked in this weaponised sauna trying not to lose his mind, when he just said «fuck it» and jumped out the hatch in nothing but his underwear and socks
The officers kinda looked over at him, they greeted each other properly, then my uncle went back inside and promptly got dressed
That's the army for you
Since 2001, I've never said "I'm freezing". When you live in a tent without heating, you're sweaty from carrying 50 kg of equipment uphill for an hour in 80cm snow and you're told to sleep on top of the sleeping bag because it's fucking red alert all night, then you kinda get a perspective on what freezing is all about
I've been cold many times since, but I save the word "freeze" for those really extreme situations
On a mission when I served we all brought our phones and one party forgot to turn it off, so we in the remaining party could see them on the Snapchat map
Not at all
But then it'd be weird, of course, seeing as we aren't a member of the EU
The sight of it would give the anti-Europeans heart attack whatever reason to fly it
Yeah, we're a part of the EEA, so we can for example move to a country in the EU and vice versa just like they can within the EU
Anti-Europeans in Norway
Norway leaving the EEA is very likely in the next 10 years
I meant anti-European, since most of the anti-EU people are also very sceptical to their own continent and some will go far to openly deny that Norway belongs to the European continent
Don't know if it's likely, but a lot of people and some political parties are either against it or open to discuss alternatives
No, it really isn't very likely
EEA support remains the majority position
I have never heard about anyone thinking Norway should not be a part of Europe
Where are you getting this from
Yeah same, never heard anyone say that
It’s the impression you get from some of the more hardcore anti-anything people, especially their relation to their own continent and everything about it
All of these are great options and are worth watching:
- *The Troll Hunter* (2010)
- *The King's Choice* (2016)
- *The 12th Man* (2017)
- *Utøya: July 22* (2018, NOT THE NETFLIX VERSION)
- *Kon-Tiki* (2012)
Edit: Might as well add the *Dead Snow*-movies if you like nazi-zombies and bad humor/horror
Flåklypa grand prix from Norway
Surprisingly accurate description
I would add "Oslo, 31
August"
Too much recent-ism, I'd say
Some classics worth watching:
Ni liv (1957)
De dødes tjern (1958)
Jakten (1959)
Semi-new:
Insomnia (1997, avoid Hollywood remake)
Reprise (2006)
I would like to add In Order Of Disappearance (Kraftidioten), my favorite Norwegian film of all time
Its not very well known, but I wish it was
Its like a Norwegian Tarantino film
I hadn't heard about this before and just looked it up
Very curious, very smart political campaigning
It kind of "Americanifies" the whole event and makes the terrorist seem like a more charismatic movie villain than the loner psychopath he truly is, as opposed to the norwegian one which does not show him at all, only the youth
Imagine if a youtuber made a movie about your country's most sensitive topic
The Netflix-version might be entertaining, but it portraits the event in a completely different way
As someone else mentioned, the "bad guy" seems like an ordinary movie villain
The one I mentioned is made in a strong and cinematically beautiful way and you can really feel how horrible it was
The *entire film is a one-take* that is exactly as long as the event (72 min) and was filmed with some really good, young actors
You never really see the psychopathic murderer and he is therefore a lot more mysterious and creepy
Wikipedia describes it this way:
"The purpose of Utøya: July 22 is to promote understanding of the victims by showing the massacre from their perspective
The film was created in close dialogue with over 40 survivors, to get the action as close to reality as possible
[2] It was shot to resemble a single take in real time,[3] and follows the character Kaja from the third-person perspective before and throughout the 72-minute attack
[4] The terrorist is only a figure in the periphery throughout the film, and is only briefly seen two times
" [Source]
TL;DR: If you want to see an ordinary movie made for entertainment, watch the Netflix-version
If you want to see a strong film made to move you, watch "Utøya: July 22"
Agree, but most people want to watch relatively new movies due to the better looking filming
I agree that it is not an exciting movie :p
Neither, but the film is made more as an entertainment-movie than it is to tell the story in a deep and meaningful way
Not entirely sure, but Google Play Movies / YouTube has it here in Norway
Raiding is so 10th century
A shaman from the Russian far east was walking all the way to Moscow to exorcise Putin, and he got a group of followers, so naturally he was compared to Forrest Gump, [and was recently kidnapped by the government]
We should pick up where he left off, after all, they may stop one, but they can't stop us all can they
Britain
Lindisfarne
We did that already
In Soviet Russia demon exorcise you
You want to plant a garden
But damn those monks had a lot of gold
That's in Asia though
Screw everyone saying merkel, give my the British queen that can’t die
She will generate lots of income in the form of tourism if she brings everything she has with her
She also can’t die so she will be like an oracle eventually
She has cute corgis
Sanna Marin, but I'd take pretty much any social democrat/leftist over our current PM
Maybe not the current party in charge though
They haven't really been all that great
We thank you for you sacrifice
Hopefully Trump will be gone by next year though
Erna is really good as PM
I don't support her party, but I support her
A very noble and creative strategy
I like your thinking here
And also, Erna Solberg isn't really that great in my opinion
She is a conservative after all
Why do you like her if not her party
She represents the party, and her interests and ideology aligns with that of the party after all
Otherwise she wouldn't be in the party
It is possible to like someone and think they do a good job even if I don't agree with everything they stand for
I respect her as a politician and a leader
I think that she is a good diplomat that unites the different parties in the coalition in a good way
I would rather have another party in charge, but as it is now, I think she is doing a good job
God, what a stupid take, and what is a major problem in politics
You can respect and like a politician even though you do not necessarily agree with everything they do
Even most social democrats currently hold a stricter immigration  policy than Merkel in 2015, not just Orban
Good thing it's Windsor then lol
I think she is doing a good job myself too
Not that I like AP, H or really any of them that much
I see where you're coming from, and I definitely agree that we could have had someone worse
I don't exactly despise Solberg, I just don't like her that much because of her policies and party
And just to be clear, it's not that I dislike her as a person, just as a politician
I'm sure we'd get along just fine in real life
But I don't believe you can every really separate a politician from their party, since, after all, if they didn't agree with the party, why would they be leading it
I agree with you in that you can't separate them, but there is still a big distance between thinking someone is doing a good job and wholeheartedly supporting their party
I agree with some of Høyre's politic, but I am more on the left spectrum
However, I think that when Venstre, KrF, Høyre and (grøss) Frp joined forces, Erna was the obvious choice as PM
Saying I support her might be the wrong wording
I wouldn't vote for her, but between her and Siv Jensen, there is no question who is the best option
Yea, and because they changed it, it's changed and they aren't german lol
I love the fact that we have such a high tolerance for dialects
In Norway, you can speak your dialect everywhere you go and expect to be understood
It's not seen as informal or improper to speak in your regional dialect on TV, the radio, in public debates etc
Professors give lectures in their dialects, politicians use speak in their dialects when passing laws in parliament, musicians frequently use their dialects in their songs, and so on
This has helped Norway maintain a great level of linguistic diversity till this day and even young people (for the most part) still learn to speak the local dialect where they grow up
That we have so many dialects
I can easily tell from what area of the country someone is based on the first few words they say
I love the word 'koselig'. It cannot really be translated into English as it has a range of meanings: comfortable, nice, warm, homely, relaxed, friendly, safe, pleasant, lovely, jovial
And more
I love how I can drive for 15 mins and people won't understand what I say
Most languages have plenty of dialects, but what sets Norwegian apart from most of the others, is that dialects are actually tolerated and used in virtually all social contexts, even super-formal ones
We can even point out the city
We have it in Norwegian as well, but I never really hear anyone actively use it for some reason
>Lack of gendered words
Are you talking about Swedish now or am I missing something
Swedish does have genders
I had some German in school, but I never knew the word fro queue
I love it
In Norwegian the word is "kø", but "venteslange" would be so much more fun to use
Mostly completely fine unless you've been living under a rock with no exposure
Might take a minute to adjust yourself to listening to it though
In my case the area I come from have totally different words with no proper translation for a non-dialect version of the words
I can drive for 15 mins and people will struggle to understand things I say
We Norwegians have several
[Gravlax] In modern times made in a slightly more acceptable way, but  during the [Middle Ages] gravlax was made by fishermen, who salted the salmon and lightly [fermented] it by burying it in the sand above the high-tide line
Sounds gross, but tastes fantastic
In modern times it is cured using salt, sugar and dill
[Smalahåve] \-  The skin and fleece of the head are torched, the brain removed, and the head is salted, sometimes [smoked] and dried
The head is [boiled] or [steamed] for about three hours, and served with mashed [rutabaga] and [potatoes] It is also traditionally served with [Akvavit] In some preparations, the brain is cooked inside the skull and then eaten with a spoon or fried
I've personally mostly eaten the version with the brain intact, as it is a sign of "manliness" to eat the brain and the eye
Yeah, I know - silly
But OK
Still, the meat on the head is the best meat on the entire animal, and of course the tongue is pure heaven, so it is a delicious dish for those who doesn't mind ending the meal with the empty eye socket of a sheep's skull staring at you - hehe
[Lutefisk]  Lutefisk is dried [whitefish] (normally [cod] but [ling] and [burbot] are also used) treated with [lye] The first step is soaking the [stockfish] in cold water for five to six days (with the water changed daily)
The saturated stockfish is then soaked in an unchanged solution of cold water and lye for an additional two days
The fish swells during this soaking, and its [protein] content decreases by more than 50 percent, producing a [jelly] consistency
When this treatment is finished, the fish (saturated with lye) is inedible with a [pH] of 11–12
To make the fish edible, a final treatment of yet another four to six days of soaking in cold water (also changed daily) is needed
Eventually, the lutefisk is ready to be cooked
[\[2\]] Lutefisk is delicious when done right, but it is so hard to get right that I would say that eight out of ten times I eat it - it is not the way it should be
But done right, it is absolutely delicious
This is not a complete list, but for the sake of not making it too long, I'll stop here
Smalahove
A sheeps head, cut in half
Salted, dried and steamed, then placed on your plate
The first time you tear away the gums revealing the teeth is pretty nasty
Also, the eyes are considered a delicacy
They honestly don't taste much, so I suspect is is just something people say to seem cool
[Smalahove] is pretty delightful, cooked sheep’s head
Where do I start
Smalahove = sheep head
Yes that is a meal
Baked fish head
Idk why we eat heads(I don’t)
Kaviar = caviar, fish eggs
Tørrfisk = Dry fish, fish hanged to dry, smells disgusting but last essentially forever
Lutefisk = fish essentially pickled in lye
Edit: This is Norway btw
Norway has a couple:
- Leverpostei: a pâté like spread made from pork liver that is a staple bread topping in most Norwegian households
Usually very popular among kids too
It's not necessarily "disgusting" but most foreigners consider it a bit weird that kids eat liver on toast for breakfast
* Lutefisk: fish (usually cod) that has been dried, then pickled in lye (which is poisonous, ends up with a pH of 11-12), then cleaned, soaked (4-6 days usually, water changed daily) and then cooked/steamed
Served with boiled potatoes and a bacon and melted butter "sauce", among other sides
The fish has a very gelatinous texture, and is a very "love it or hate it" dish
Usually served around Christmas time
Fun fact: this dish can permanently corrode silverware if not cleaned immediately after
* Boiled fish head: straight up what it sounds like
A boiled head of cod (whole) that is traditionally served to the father/head of the house as it is considered "the best part of the fish". The tongue is especially highly regarded
Served with boiled potatoes and melted butter with parsley
* Rakfisk: fish, usually trout, that had been salted and fermented for a 2-3 months, up to a year
Served uncooked
I've had it with lefse (basically a potato based tortilla), a strong-ish cheese and dill
* Gravlaks: A personal favorite of mine
Salmon that has been cured in salt, sugar, dill (and sometimes other spices) for up to a week
Served uncooked with a sweet honey-mustard and dill sauce, often on top of bread
(this is legit one of my all-time favourite dishes
It is sooooo good
My dad makes a great one
We put Liver Paté on bread
It's really common and kids love it
Some people eat smalahove, which is a sheep head (even Norwegians find that one disgusting
I have one that isn't disgusting, but I saw an American complain about our waffles
The waffles u have taste like diabetes
Doesn't like all countries have this
We have Aspic dishes in Norway as well, and though they aren't on top of my list, I do enjoy eating them
I think even us fond this disgusting
Nothing wrong with Haggis really
We have something similar in Norway called Finker
&#x200B;
Biggest difference is that Finker isn't served with a poem and bagpipes playing ;) hehe
I agree on the pies, I'd consider going on a "pie tour of Britain" if someone ever put together such a thing
hehe
Frog legs - sure, had them a few times, they are good
Snails - OK, but the snails doesn't have much taste - so the few (7-10) times I tried it, it mostly tasted garlic :)
If you by old cheeses mean cheeses that smells like someone died a week a go - then yes - bring them - I love those
The last one, I haven't tried that exact dish, but I do love pigs trotters, and offal dishes can be good :)
It certainly is
And a thought popped into my head just now
There are so many delicious foods that has an ancestry that by current health and safety standards would never have been allowed
Gravlax is one, Lutefisk another, and in France - of course Blue Cheese and I'm sure you can think of others as well
So, perhaps one should ask - does current standards limit the creation of new and amazing food types
Hmmm - perhaps we should formulate that one better and put it forward as a question here in Reddit
I do love steak tartar as well, and once got a tuna version in a gourmet restaurant in Barcelona
You should try that one too if you can
Yeah, but atleast they have sauce and other stuff to hide the taste, and I have seen Norwegians eat nothing but dry fish and potatoes
I agree completely to that sentiment :)
Well, since pies does have more than a few calories - walking in between meals would be a jolly good idea
There are only two problems with that plan
One - English weather, and two - every time it started raining we'd end up on the nearest pub, which would be very nice but would make the trip quite hard to get done in the allotted time frame ;) hehe
I don't have any pies at home, but I do have beer
It'll have to do for now ;) hehe
Yes, we should absolutely do such a trip after all this is over
Tbh, the lack of sunlight
Not the temperature, I don’t mind the cold and haven’t been enjoying the last few 30+ degrees summers we have had, and the lack of snow during the winter
I enjoy the cold and the large amounts of snow
But what I cannot stand is the lack of sunlight
It’s dark when I go to school(08:00) and dark when I come home from school(16:00) there is sunlight between 09:00 and 13:00/14:00, so you only get to see it from the inside, and don’t get to actually experience it
And winter depression is very very real, and I and way too many others gets extremely affected by it
I think Canada is quite similar to the Nordic countries in many ways, except Canada is a huge country, the Nordics are small
As a Norwegian, sometimes Canada looks like what the US would be like if it was run by Norwegians
Here is a couple of things, but I am not sure it fits all the Nordic countries, but it does apply for Norway:
Most Nordic people have lived on small farms or secluded villages and very small towns for thousands of years
It has seeped into our personality and DNA
Personality wise we are small town folks
Some would admit that, some would claim they are very international and open minded
But the law of Jante is still living strong within many of us
If anything, that is the Nordic mentality you would meet if you did a road trip around all the Nordic countries
If you are a doctor, lawyer, engineer, any specialist with a long education and a sought after degree, your education will most likely be free, but your salary is substantially lower than if you had the same job in the US
Or Canada I would guess
Norway have unions that make deals with the government like "if you ask for a 2,2% raise instead of a 3,5%, the government promise inflation will be less than 1% instead of a 2,5% annual inflation". It keeps salaries down and helps export/import industries competing internationally
Cars are really expensive
This is not true for all Nordic countries (Sweden have Volvo (and used to have Saab), so it is different there)
But in Norway, if you like a car with a big engine, cars are extremely expensive
A sports car can cost allmost double in Norway than in other European countries or the US
Cars are partly taxed on Co2 emissions, engine size etc so whenever I hear a V8 engine coming down the street, I turn my head
That is why EVs are so popular, they have no extra tax so they are priced the same as in other countries (cheap by Norwegian standards)
It’s way too dark and cold in the winter
It rains a lot the rest of the year
In the winter, the snow and cold weather is nice for skiing and all, but annoying when you go about your life on cold or snow heavy days: Mowing snow off your house entrance, mowing snow off your car, scraping off extremely tough ice off your car windows, having to walk through untouched snow and getting wet, and so on
It’s a constant chore
In addition to the other things people have pointed out here I will address the cultural and social issues
Someone has already mentioned Janteloven, that you’re not allowed to be or do something, it’s restraining talents and competence as I see it
It may hinders Norway and Norwegians to prosper, search and pursue ideas
Education isn’t necessarily worth anything
This country seems built upon the idea that you in general shall not wish for anything more or better
Wanting cheese
Your supermarket has the same boring pasteurised cow milk cheese in 40 different brands
Live with it
Casual racism and homophobia is also pretty common, especially in more rural areas and among older people and less educated ones
Life can be pretty boring it seems outside of the bigger cities, depending on what you like
There isn’t usually much going on in the countryside or rural areas, little social meeting places, tiny amounts of businesses and shops etc
As known getting social contact up here can be pretty difficult in general
One HUGE problem for all the Nordic countries is that we are  ranked among the highest in terms of suicide rates
I think not a lot of people know this (especially the locals) but I think it's important to put out here
No one knows the reason for this but one theory could be that Nordic people tend to be more reserved and mostly keep to themselves
What do you guys think
How can the countries known for being the best to live in also have one of the highest suicide rates
Another problem is the 'taboo' topics we have here
My impression is that at least for us Norwegians, talking about not having enough money or struggling in life is something I find most Norwegians rarely talk about
As for the darkness, I don't mind that as much as I do with the temperature here
It gets pretty cold
What bothers me the most is the amount of selections available here
Grocery stores are exactly the same
They sell the exact same thing, just at different prices
One exception is 'Meny' who at least has a reasonable amount of import food
Food you don't really get at the other stores
When it comes to import food it's close to zero here
Everything is locally produced
I think it's good that we have food and products made locally here but I believe it needs to be a more 'mix'. That's just my opinion
Then of course there are the taxes for absolutely everything
I have one of those midnattsol-lights, it works wonders
Edit, [Lysterapilampe]
Also the rain, specially in rain cities like Bergen
280 times a year is too damn high
It depends on where you live in norway, i also live here and it doesn’t get dark until 17:00 in the winter
You nailed it
I never thought of the fact that we tend to not dare to ask too many (nosy) questions, but that is so true
Reminds me of a American who were amazed that a Norwegian cashier was able to afford going to the US for holiday
First of all amazed that they were able to take 3 weeks off work to go anywhere
secondly that they were able to afford the plane ticket and stay in the US
But since a cashier earn maybe only 17,200 euro per year in the US, you can understand their confusion
In some extent yes
Depending on where you live, it seems more common to marry younger in more rural areas and far north than it does in Oslo
It’s much about a cultural thing I guess
> There is also a non negligible living cost
If you come from the outside, sure
But if you live and _work_ here, your point is useless
I may actually invest in one of those
Thank you
I just bought one of those
Do you use it with advice from a doctor or are you freestyling
Some nights it doesn’t even go dark really
But if you go further north in Norway, the sun will be up 24-7 in the summer, and they will not see the sun from November-February
It looks like there is
There are statistics, reports and research done on it
It simulates natural sunlight
Fools me :)
Just freestyling ;) A few hours in the afternoon does the trick
Edit: Tyrkleif
You live north of Svalbard
Next sunrise in Longyearbyen is mid February
Depends on person to person of course, but they’re more likely to spend their 20s studying, living, have fun, try to get a career and just not settle down yet
You find somewhere to work first, then you worry about somewhere to live
That's how it works :-) Also, poor people in Norway aren't as poor as in other countries
Sure we got _extremley_ poor people, but those are few
Yeah, or therapy light
The wake up clock light things are a bit cheap and not very good IMO
And what was the explanation
I see your point, but that's not the criterion for when the sun rises
You can head up to the nearest mountain and see the sun rise from there
It's sort of like saying you don't see the sun rise when you're in your basement
Just because humans decided to settle in the shadow of a mountain doesn't mean the sun doesn't rise on the other side
Bitte sehr
Ok, okay, okei etc is pretty commen in Norway
Im pretty shure its a loan word from english here
I hear it quite a bit in Norway
It can be pronounced just as often in the English form as it is with the Norwegian (sounds like oh-kuu)
Very common here, we write ok the same way but okay is okei
I am not sure if it is an official word but it’s sp common that it should get added
Hey buddy, we still independent, also we are very very rich now
"We found oil"
So it turns out it wasn’t just fish in the sea
Oil
That everything worked out well for the entire period except for a short few years of 1940-45
I’d tell this person that we suffered through a new world war, this time Norway was much more directly involved than the first one, but we got through german occupation and found oil in the North Sea
We are now rich because of it, so your average Joe today is much better off than back in his time, where Norway was still a young, developing nation lagging behind our Scandinavian neighbours
I would tell him how Gerhardsen and his labour party basically built a new nation from scratch after the war, that we will have our most prosperous period ever (and still going on) and try to explain why the biggest issue for people today are toll plazas and not starving to death
"...although it turns out that 'stay neutral and lie low' trick only works once
When it comes to history, boring is good
Sirup på blodpølse
Norsk blodpølse er omtrent lik tror jeg, smaker litt søtt med kanel/kardemomme aktig smak
Jeg vet det høres rart ut men jeg vokste opp med sirup på blodpølse, det er noe med søtheten og den sprø brente smaken
Jeg ser absolutt verdien i å balansere søtt med surt, så kanskje jeg skal prøve med tyttebær neste gang
Probably true
Can't really remember having learned anything other than the potato famine that caused people to go to America and The Troubles
Any interesting parts you suggest I read up on or movies/documentaries I watch
Awesome
Cheers buddy
The most modern looking place in norway is probably barcode in Oslo
[The so called Barcode area in Oslo
Second this
[Wiki]
Don't tell /r/Avoid5 about that place
In dialects from northern Norway (where many of the villages named Å are located), it's possible to have a (slightly meaningful) conversation with only vowels:
>Person A: "Æ e i Å, æ."
>Person B: "Å? Æ e i Å æ å!"
meaning:
>Person A: "I'm in Å."
>Person B: "Oh
I'm in Å as well
I live like 5 minutes away from a "Li" here
i find the same with germanor even dutch, i can somewhat understand the writing but not really the spoken form
Almost, if not literally every name in the Norwegian Harry Potter series
* Professor Bumblebee-spin
* ... and McPurse
* ...and Sly-clever (though to be fair, at least it's a portmanteau in Norwegian)
* Quirrell turned into something that sounds like a pastry
Like, let's go ahead and name one of the primary villains in this book "pritzel".
* Dolores Jane Umbridge ["umbrage"] is now Venke (generic old-fashioned girl's name, in a weird spelling) Dolorosa "Uffert" (no meaning, sounds dumb as shit)
* ... then a few others that don't sound like anything at all (Flitwick is "Pirrevimp", for example)
Then of course there's
* the kidnapping, torture and murder victim Berta Flurp (no, that doesn't mean shit either, and it sounds jarringly idiotic)
* The respected textbook author Miranda Pogo-stick
* The Weasleys are Wildsons
* Malfoy is Malfang, for no discernible reason and with no clear meaning, either
* Granger just lost the "er", also for no clear reason
* Bones became "legging" or "boning", your choice
* Goyle became Gargle
Crabbe became
well, actually "crab", which is *definitely* better than average
* The Irish dude went from Finnegan or whatever into Finnimann or something, absolutely no sense
Just about the only defensible change in the entire fucking series is Tom Marvolo Riddle becoming Tom Dredolo Venster, and only because the anagram gag had to work out somehow
For bonus points: "Baggins" was turned into (by the same guy, I have no fucking doubt) "Pocket-cozy".
In the case of LotR, Tolkien himself intended proper names to be translated into something with the same connotations in the target language
"Frodo Baggins" is supposed to be an English translation of the character's name in the fictional language Westron, Maura Labingi
The Harry Potter names are rather badly translated
Dumbledore is "Humlesnurr", which means bumblebee-spin, a word that sounds very
kids-y. The Golden Snitch is "Gullsnoppen", where "snoppen" is a sort of cuteish slang for dick
I love the translations into Norwegian
Sure, some of them are better than others, but remember that these are children's books, and the intended audience would have had no chance at catching most of the connotations the original names are meant to have in English
The translations aren't necessarily intended to translate the names' *meanings* literally, but rather the feelings they evoke
And yes, the same guy (Torstein Bugge Høverstad) translated both the *Harry Potter* books and *The Lord of the Rings*. He's brilliant
Also, when it comes to Tolkien, most people in this entire thread seem woefully unaware that Tolkien actually created [a guide for how to translate names in *The Lord of the Rings*] which most translations since the guide's release have benefitted from
So if you're going to blame anyone for "weird" translations of names in LOTR, blame Tolkien himself
Yep
Midgard, that is
Well, all names have some meaning
But the literal meaning of Harry's name doesn't have any significance in the books
It's not like he's really into making vases or anything
I think the meaning behind Harry's name is that he's just a regular English kid, with a common English name
... shit, I forgot about Frank
What the fuck
>The translation of Harry Potter looks like a swede tried to make fun of Norwegians, but you did that shit yourself
Accurate
They even called the snitch "snopp".
This
I'll defend the norwegian HP translation till the day I die
Yes
It seemed like one of those thing that are put there to make the grownups laugh but fly under the radar with the kids
It is really strange considering Georg is a pretty common name
Not personally, being an atheist from a different country
I realize, respect and regret that there's a lot of damage being done though, it's a tragedy from a historical perspective alone
I hate seeing historical stuff get destroyed
A thing people forget is that it was also the birthplace of «modern» music
The idea of melodies on top of one another was concieved within those walls
YES im literally shaking and crying, this is so bad
Wow, I really don't want to find out how this could be given a racist spin
Happy birthday :)
Fuck those idiots
Here in Norway the police advise people to call them rather than complain directly
I do not like that, the police should be for crimes
> Its one of the first responses/complaints I here from foreigners about Germany
> We like to stare, a lot
I've been to Germany many times, but never saw anyone staring
Absolutely, I agree
No need to escalate the situation in person if you already complained and they ignored it
My husband speaks Afrikaans
He understands everything the Dutch say
They don't understand anything of what he says
I would assume they're quite mutually intelligible
To me, as a Norwegian they all sound mostly like a combination of dunken cheers, sneezes and coughs interspersed with words that are unmistakably Norwegian
I believe they're all lost Scandinavian tribes that settled there during the Viking age, caught a nasty cold and started drinking
Since they all sound the same, they probably understand each other too
Not at all
They're just languages
The thoughts behind what I vocalize are exactly the same
Of course people from rural areas and small towns hate Oslo and Oslo people
Since it, like most other capitals, is the economic center of the nation, there's a lot of rich people there, and rich people are generally disliked
Myself, I freaking love Oslo
And during my years of living there, and also after I moved away, I've gotten to know a lot of people there, many of them are absolute down to earth super fine people just like the rest of the country
I would say that Oslo is generally quite liked, but basically everyone sees the people who live in west-Oslo as rich snobs
Yes ours
Oslo is generally well liked from what I know
At least I don't know of anyone who dislikes it
In Norway Oslo is worshipped even though it is the worst city
I've traveled to most of the European countries, and I really love Vilnius
Come on, Copenhagen is gorgeous
Did you like it more than Tallinn
Co-signed
Yeah, I found Vilnius and Lithuania more friendly to be honest
It was also very easy to get around, great nightlife and nice architecture
If by foreign you also mean English, then yes
I've yet to meet another Norwegian who doesn't speak English
Unless they're a child, of course
most people speak english, but we dont use it much other than on the internet
It’s expected that you know English if you’re younger than 50
We also have to learn a third language in school, but the expectations for learning those are significantly lowered
Cool to hear that you want to learn Norwegian
You can check out the subreddit /r/norsk for resources and help from natives or others in the same situation
Where does your mother live
Yes, except if you are visiting someone for a house party or pre-drinks and need to cool the beverages you brought (and it’s pretty much always BYOB)
Then it’s absolutely socially accepted
Maybe along with a polite “Hey I’ll put these in your fridge if you don’t mind”, but I’d be surprised if anyone told me no
Same for Norway
Swedish football's domestic supporter culture
It's just head and shoulders above the rest of the nordics
They do have more people but still, the Stockholm clubs especially have great support, and they got some fantastic rivalries
We need more of that here, Oslo is abseloutley dead
The Danes are like us but more chill
Edit: looks like another Norwegian already wrote the exact same thing
Sweden: Just feels like a more ambitious and international version of Norway
I feel like Swedes could fit in any place in the world, but still be Swedish if that makes sense
Their ultras (football fans) are always better then Norwegian ones as well
Unless you are from Scania their language is also beautiful
Denmark: I feel like Norwegians either identify more with Sweden or Denmark
I am the latter
Hygge is so nice
I also enjoy Danish art and culture products more than Swedish ones
Finland: The only people in the world that are funnier than Brits are Finns
Honestly, their style of dark humour is next level
The Swedes are very good at making music, maybe as good as the UK or USA (but scaled down in terms of population, of course)
Also, you do your best at winter sports and it's adorable
Sweden has a national cinnamon roll day
I respect that
Sweden are good at making quality-stuff for the general public (Ikea and Volvo-cars for example)
Finland are very cool and special (in a good way)
Russia has a lot of culture and history
Denmark has alot of good food, nice beaches and are very laid-back
Iceland is beautiful and a very special place to travel to
> Finland/Norway: good poltical culture, seem like organized and efficient people
Thanks
And I like brick houses
All our houses are wooden
And wooden houses are definitely more common here than in Sweden
Wasn't the www invented at CERN
Mongolia is like number 1 on my travel list
I find central Asia to be quite an alluring part of the world, in big part because of the reason OP listed, that we never really hear about them, so there is somewhat of a mystery to the place
Also obscenely big statues fascinate me so I really want to go see the Ghengis Khan one
I can't remember it too clearly but I love the idea and concept, even though it perhaps didn't have as much interest as it should have
My team Lillestrøm even managed to come to the final one year so I'd love to see a return of it honestly
Sorry to hear that

Ohhhh
I actually thought it was a town called Alko
Now I get it
You can't use a surname as a given name, unless it has a history or tradition as a given name, either in Norway or elsewhere, or has a tradition in a culture that doesn't distinguish between given names and surnames
Apart from that, there are no rules for given names (there are some more rules for surnames), except the most important one: The name can be rejected if it will be a severe liability for the person, or if other strong reasons apply
It's intentionally vague so that it can be used to reject everything from Vidkun Quisling to X Æ A-12
Yes, § 8
and § 10
[here]
§ 8
You can't choose a first name that has been in use as a last name
§ 10
You can't choose a name that will be a disadvantage to the person
Yes, I think I have heard that there is a list of approved names and if you choose a name outside of the list you need to ask to get it approved
Icelandic names must have case declensions, follow Icelandic writing (no C's, for instance), and not embarrass (hurt) the person named
A maximum of three first names can be given a person
If memory serves, there are around 1800 female names and 1700 male names approved
My personal favorite is [The Viking Ship Museum] where you can walk amongst authentic viking ships and other viking artifacts
It could also be [The Norwegian museum of cultural history]
My gf and I visited pergamon two years ago
It was very impressive and had lots of things to see
Unfortunately we didn’t have enough time to visit the other museums, but would love to come back
I definitely can recommend the Pergamon museum to other tourists
i mean technically techinally, the Vatican IS *in* Italy
This place is amazing
It has to be the [Nobel Peace Center] for me
> I loved the Vigeland Sculpture Park
My favourite place in Oslo
I remember my parents talked English, but it didn't last very long as it didn't take that long till I could understand them
I remember them talking in English when I was very young
Although we start learning English in 1st grade so I remember around that age I'd often be able to figure out roughly what they were talking about so they stopped doing that when I was still quite young
We use English
It doesn't last long before the kids learn it though
I try other languages sometimes, but I don't know so much German, French or Spanish
Norwegian comedy group with a sketch about exactly this
No subtitles, but you get the gist
English, or you spell the word out
Neither method will work on children above the age of 7
Its never annoying when someone puts in the effort to learn a new language
It would be easier if they'd just speak English, but it's very charming
For me it depends a lot on context
If someone approach me to speak a very broken Norwegian, I will ask if English is easier (because I might not have the time to listen to someone stumbling through pronunciation and trying to piece together some meaning)
My experience is usually a huge look of relief and a functional and effective English conversation lol
If it’s someone who is learning Norwegian for actual speaking Norwegian purposes, I will do my best to spend time having the conversation with them
But the common tourist who has learned phrases, and isn’t capable of understanding a fully functional reply
nah
Not very helpful
I have the “textbook” dialect (like my mom calls it lol, not because it’s the superior dialect, but because my dialect is as close as it gets to the written bokmål you will find in textbooks and tourist guides), so I’m a good person to practice on
Many many places in Norway feature dialects far away from the written form
Just go with english, if you can, 90% of us speak it very well
It's annoying if they expect me to change how I speak so they can understand me
But it depends on context
If it's someone I know, I'm much more accommodating
If a tourist asks me something in clearly broken Norwegian, my answer will always be in English
It's 100% certain they won't understand my dialect
I read through the comments to see if anyone in Finland commented
Sadly they didn't.
Hell, I feel like I need a drink after trying to speak and understand Danish
Especially in Norway since everyone here speaks English
Yeah, if they are able to speak English and their Norwegian is horrible, I would very strongly prefer it if they just spoke English instead
I find it awkward to ask people to switch to English because then I’m basically telling them their Norwegian is bad
Plus it’ll take forever if they aren’t familiar with the local dialect and I have to repeat myself all the time
I have become annoyed by it before, but the poor people didn’t speak English either, so it wasn’t really their fault, I think I was just frustrated and wanted it to end
It certainly doesn't help though, to answer OP's question
I'd say we understand English a million times better than tourists understand Norwegian
Yeah
But
Then it doesn’t help their confidence in Norwegian
If English is just spoken for them
I agree with your main point, but the “danger” of automatically switching to English without asking, is that what if for example you just didn’t hear them properly and they weren’t as bad as you actually thought
Do you only switch if you’re completely sure it’s hopeless, when you’re sure their Norwegian really is that bad
That is interestingly the case with English as well, but at least you can blame William and the French influence
I assume he is still working on it and still not very fluent
Often people switch to English because they think it is more efficient and easier
I think it is bit of a cultural thing
We are not much of talkers to strangers, and if we can do something to get "out" of that situation we will do it
Sucks for your brother though, that wants to learn the language
Me personally would answer in my dialect if I was talked to in Norwegian and switch to English if not understood
The "standard" you refer too is an eastern Norwegian dialect, and I will not personally switch to it, that is a loss
Edit
I also find English easier than switching dialect, won't be as artificial or weird
"Standard" dialect in Norway is far less seen as a standard than in many other countries
E.g. news presenters still use their local dialects
We don’t really do that
If you ask us a question in bad Norwegian we’ll answer in our own dialect
Some might try to avoid a few certain, specific words if they know from experience that people often get confused by them
The thing about Norwegian is that all dialects are considered equal, and it's almost seen as a weakness of character if you change your dialect if you move somewhere else
There is no standard Norwegian, but Oslo area dialect is what you will hear the most in media, and it's the dialect taught to foreigners
The result is that for me, it's much easier to speak English than change the way I speak Norwegian so a foreigner can understand it
And the difference between my dialect and understandable Norwegian for a beginner is about the same as if I had to switch to Swedish
Dude you’re complaining people aren’t willing to adjust their speech in their own country, you realize that’s ridiculous, right
>Native English speakers adapt our speech to non-natives all the time and rarely feel put out by the situation
Well good for you, then you do that
>You’re just forcing the other person to change their way of speech instead
Your choice, plus you’re the one in a different country
>Your English likely isn’t as amazing as some would lead you to believe, and that’s okay
Well that just sounded rude
>It still requires extra effort for a native English speaker to understand, though
And it might require extra effort for us to talk to you
>Why is it so common for people in other countries to feel it’s not their responsibility to try when somebody makes an effort in a non-English language
Because it is not our responsibility
> I’m pretty much fluent in Swedish now but I had this issue at lot, especially at the beginning of learning
I’ve had to resort to pretending I don’t speak English just to get somebody to speak to me in Swedish
Well I personally believe people should usually respond back in the same language as they were asked, and ask before switching to English if it was necessary, and that in most cases it’s rude to not do this
But at at the very beginning of learning people might be so terrible that it’s not even possible to know what their saying, so some might prefer not to even give them the choice
It’s also annoying when someone who is very bad at the language wants to bother you by asking for help, when they are able to ask in English which would make it all quicker
But it depends on the situation
Once the learner is good enough in the language that it would go smoothly with the local language, I believe one should stick to that language instead of switching to English just because the other person sound foreign
>I mean, I’m sure you don’t just switch to English when you have a hard time understanding somebody with a speech defect or a learning disability
What
No because it wouldn’t make difference
I'm not the one initiating conversation in this scenario, so I'm not obligated to speak in any way I don't feel comfortable with
If you have problems understanding me, that's your problem, not mine
And as I said, it depends on context
If you're someone I know who is trying to learn the language, I'll do everything I can to help you (and I have done that in the past), but if I don't know you and you expect me to speak to you slowly in a completely different dialect, you can honestly fuck right off
And I also don't think you should change the way you speak to non-native speakers if you don't feel comfortable with it, if you're on the receiving end
Even some native Norwegians have trouble with my dialect if they haven't been exposed to it, so if someone approaches me and there's any indication they're not a native speaker, I switch, because I know from experience that there's no way we can have a meaningful conversation in Norwegian
That being said, I don't mind that they continue speaking in Norwegian if they want, but I won't waste time with my dialect
Even during
They don’t meant that we don’t speak Norwegian here, they mean that all of us are able to speak English as well
I’ve unfortunately heard of people who have been here for many years and are fluent (with a obvious, but easily understood, accent) and that have actually experienced being answered in English by people working in stores
These people (the ones speaking English) don’t seem to realize how extremely rude that is, and obviously not helpful at all in those situations
Of course it’s possible some of them are so used to dealing with foreigners that struggle with the language that their brain automatically switches to English at the sign of an accent/foreign looks, but they should learn to stop and think about what they’re doing, and learn to ask before switching (if it’s necessary to switch), especially when dealing with customers
(But if some random person or someone you don’t want to talk to starts talking to you, I totally understand just switching to English to get out of it
So if anyone reads this and think they are guilty of it, become more aware of what you’re doing
Yeah
I feel really awkward whenever I have to use eastern dialect words to get understood (mostly when speaking with danes or swedes)
I'd rather just switch to English in that case
Then they should probably make that clear, so the native can decide if that's something they want/have the time for/etc
It's not the job of every random person you meet on the street (or worse, in a service job) to teach you their language
But if you ask and they say they're comfortable doing that, then that's cool
I’m looking at it from an Immigrant perspective
Tourists yeah I get it for sure
But I have seen so many Immigrants play the “English Card” and take the easier way out, or natives giving them the easy way out
Yeah I get that, and if they’re just a random person on the street you don’t really owe them anything
But I think that unless you are sure they are terrible at Norwegian, in many cases it would be good to think it through
Someone who has an accent could have lived here for half/most of their life and be used to the strangest dialects
It would feel very rude to them if they were replied to in English
I feel like many Norwegians’ thresholds for switching are becoming a bit low
I know of people who have been here for many years (we’re talking a decade or two or more, but you can clearly hear they aren’t native) and have experienced people working in stores replying to them in English
In those cases it’s obviously extremely rude
But it seems like it happens more the more “acceptable” it becomes to switch, and it seems like it’s becoming more and more acceptable
Is it a good thing to be shy
I used to have a Spanish gf who was pretty shy and introverted, whereas I’m really talkative and outgoing, so it was kinda fun how we broke each other’s countries’ stereotypes lol
Then foreigners have a leg up on Norwegians, because we don't learn a standard dialect
We learn the dialect we speak through osmosis, and then we learn a written standard language
Technically if we try we would be able to switch dialects
The thing is that we are normally not willing to do that
Most likely if Norwegians realize that you struggle a bit, they might talk a bit slower
And like I said, they might avoid some specific words if it causes confusion, like words that they don’t use that often and they know is very specific to their dialect
A few times I’ve been extra nice and switched some common words I actually use a lot, because I was having a little conversation with someone who was struggling but wants to learn
I have also spoken sentences in eastern dialect
But I only did so because I was willingly helping someone to learn the language, I wouldn’t really do that normally, even if someone finds my dialect difficult
Oh so you think it’s a negative thing then
Jeg
All these can be translated to I, probably not the worst offender either
I guess you could say that we are very proud of our dialects
It shows people where we grew up, we keep them when we move away and it would be considered strange if someone changed their dialect
Switching to a more “standardized” version (like what foreigners learn, similar to how we might sound like when we read out loud)  seems like an extreme measure
Maybe it is kind of like one of your suggestions, that it’s also knowing that one is not better or worse than the other
It’s also not very common to “go the extra mile” for people you don’t know well
People might help out someone they know or take a liking to, but usually don’t really want to bother it with some stranger
Also, it feels unnatural and you remain conscious of the fact that you’re speaking differently, and as soon as you relax you might start mixing in your own again
So it might not work in a setting where you’re doing other things at the same time (like work situation)
Like you see here, some prefer English more than switching
Also a lot of people probably never even considered the possibility, most of the time it doesn’t even cross my mind that it’s an alternative
I started being more aware that it was even a possibility as I started uni and met more people from other places, and even now I usually forget it
Earlier I think I had only thought about it when it came to Swedes and Danes
So since your are talking English and come from france you are part of the same problem in your country
How so
Damn for some reason I just assumed Poles could understand Russians and Ukrainians
So what’s left, Belarusian and Czechian
Actually if your Swedish becomes good enough that it doesn’t sound very wrong to a Norwegian, there’s a good chance of them making an effort to speak Norwegian with you instead of just switching to English, especially those that aren’t that young
There’s a little “pressure” to try to speak our own languages when speaking to other Scandinavians, instead of just switching to English
Also, older generations in general (not like elderly , but like from 40/50+ maybe) are more likely to want to avoid speaking English and prefer in to speak Norwegian
The people that just suddenly switch to English ([even when it’s rude
I gave an example somewhere else)]
are usually younger generations
As a bonus, the older generations are also better at Swedish (to understand it and know which Norwegian words might confuse Swedes and use a different word, even a Swedish word, instead)
Thanks for the information, I had never even heard about Sorbian and Kashubian
For some reason the word Silesian sounds really familiar even though I don’t know why, maybe Ive seen someone mentioned it on this subreddit before or something
Good luck with learning Swedish
I have to admit I think it’s a pretty language
You might not get very far with Swedish in the Denmark, the closest towns might be more used to Swedish though, but Danish is really difficult to understand
Like even for me it’s super hard, and can be actually impossible depending on the person speaking (but many Norwegians are better at it than me)
You probably know better than me how it is in Finland
I’m also really curious if Icelandic people would be able to understand it, I gotta do some research on that
I had no idea about any of that, this was a very interesting read
Thank you so much for taking the time to educate me a little
> Danish is even calles Danish, because when you stuff a danish into your mouth you will speak Danish
Hahaha hadn’t heard that one before
Yeah the reason I was wondering about Iceland is that they apparently learn Danish is school as well, but I have no idea how much they actually retain and if it’s enough to understand Swedish
Would actually be really cool to learn Icelandic or norse
I was going to say sulphur, but then I saw OP's country flair and decided it might be unnecessarily redundant
Kind of like the phrase "unnecessarily redundant".
Like a mix of fish and sheep, but if that smell was like a nice, fresh, earthy, rain smell
And for Hirtshals: Fish
Oh God I love Denmark
Ok, I'm moving to your place the very second Covid ends
I went to the Naples suburbs a few years back and we got lost
We stopped on the side of the small road to look at the map, and then SUDDENLY a wild Ferrari fucking flew by, absolutely zooming for at least 100-120 km/h (speed limit must've been 50)
I guess it was a 10 or 12 cylinder eninge based on the noise
And that noise, I tell you, that noise made me almost piss my pants
My small town is a fairly rich town, but I don't think more than probably one of the inhabitants have proper luxury sports cars, so it's rare for me to see
Let alone hear it going at full speed
It's greasy and gamey
I don't know, honestly
I've only had duck once, and that was about 20 years ago, but if I remember correctly, duck was a lot more tender
I'm vegetarian, so my meat reference isn't too exact
"You're vegetarian but you know what bear tastes like
", you may be asking
That's because I'm a shitty vegetarian, and when I have the opportunity to try a bit of meat from an unusual animal, I'll go for it
Haha
That was a delightful story
What did it actually taste like
I always imagine that things like that and roadkill taste like actual garbage
That reminds me of a story of a friend of mine from New Zealand
There's a local bird in that country called a kereru or wood pigeon, and they're protected
They're only allowed to be hunted in very controlled quantities, and only by the Maori, using traditional hunting methods
This made it all the more forbidden fruit to my friend's mother, who thought they looked so plump and delicious
One day a kereru got drunk on fermented berries, flew into a window, and died
So my friend's mother took the opportunity to cook it and eat it
By all accounts it did not taste very good at all, but my friend and his family now know that for sure, thanks to his resourceful mother
Edit for extra meat: one fantastic unusual meat I tried was muskox prosciutto
It was so light and salty and complex, I'd definitely try it again
Technically the Norwegian population is decreasing, the only thing keeping our numbers up are immigration
We birth too few children
And as I am in my late teens I can’t really say I have noticed a difference, but maybe someone older than me have
My father says he has noticed huge changes, mainly that many workers are no longer Norwegian fluent
I.e delivery people, customer service and other
Edit: typo
Yes
It's less harmful than tobacco and alcohol, which are perfectly legal, and it's not addictive (Heard from people, not tried it myself)

I though the iron curtain was an actual iron wall of some kind
I was young
In 1992, I went to a jamboree scout camp in Germany
By then the border from DK was definitely not as open as now
I remember the grenzepolizei entering and looking through the bus checking everyone's passports, and probably in the luggage compartment
What made the most impression on me: the polizei was armed
At least with a glock in their belt, maybe also an automatic gun
It was my first encounter with a: the police, and b: guns
Thank goodness they made us bigger
We would almost not be visible otherwise
> I think 99% of people think Finland is a part of scandinavia
You could just as well been part of Scandinavia
That's pretty recent
Same in Norwegian
I know
But part of northern Finland is in fact part of the Scandinavian peninsula
But you have a Norwegian username
Anyways, decently snowy winters in the past few years here in south of Norway, but very mild this year
No snow now or forecasted next ten days
May turn around though, quite common for February to be snow heavy
It can even snow a lot in March
Lisbon (probably my favourite city
Been there just once but I can’t wait to go back
Madrid (love the atmosphere, easy to get around on a very good metro system, lots of history and it’s not too touristy
I almost put Seville in this spot but Madrid edges it due to being much bigger and metropolitan like)
London (food, shopping, history, new and old architecture
London literally has everything and it’s so much more than Oxford Street)
Copenhagen (very cool and relaxed city
For me it feels very much like home but bigger and a little better)
Krakow (the city centre is beautiful
It’s cheap and there’s lots of good food
Only thing I’m not into is the increasing conservatism and racist/homophobic attitude of the country and it was somewhat noticeable when we were there)
I see several people recommend Bergen
And yes its very nice, just remember to bring an umbrella
So Bergen, Isola Bella, Copenhagen, Vienna, Krakow in the right order
Special is Porto
Is special Porto
Porto special is

I'm not very picky when it comes to coffee as long as it doesn't taste sour
We in the nordics drink the most coffee per capita, so I guess it has been perfected for quite a while due to is popularity
Top coffee drinking countries per capita per year:
Finland - 12 kg
Norway - 9
9 kg
Iceland - 9 kg
Denmark - 8
7 kg
Sweden - 8
My girlfriend (samboer) is half polish and grew up in Sweden before she moved to Norway in her '20s.
It works great, but then again we are hardly talking about the biggest cultural differences here
I haven't dated a lot, but briefly dated a Japanese girl while I was on exchange in Australia
We bonded over our different cultures and our love for food
And the fact we both spoke 3-4 languages (with only English in common)
Most of our dates were focused around trying some new food that at least one of us hadn't tried yet, and talking about our different cultures as well as talking about Australia
And teaching each other words and frases in our respective languages
Honestly, I kinda find being from another culture to be an attractive quality
Probably because my parents are from different countries themselves, and I've spent over a decade of my life living abroad (I'm in my mid 20s)
Same in Norway
Well, there's the Swedish radio host (on Norwegian radio) who, when asked what she had been up to over the weekend, said something like "jag har bare pulat" (pardon my Swedish)
In Swedish it means roughly "I've just been doing small things here and there" (I don't know if there's a good English word for it), but in Norwegian it means "I've just been fucking".
This is something a lot of Norwegians struggle with as well, and that's the difference between "kj" sounds and "skj" sounds
skj is the "sh" in English, while "kj/ki" sounds very similar, but is slightly "lighter". Imagine forming your mouth to say "ee", but say "sh" instead while keeping that position
Now,, there are very few words that distinguish between the two, but the worst offender is "kjede" and "skjede".
"Kjede" = Chain
"Skjede" = Vagina
Only pronunciation difference is a slightly different "sh" sound
That said, most people ignore this, skjede is rarely used these days and it's always very obvious which one you're talking about
My dad’s Polish neighbour once wanted to ask why my dad wasn’t married to his live-in-parter (yet)
«Hvorfor er dere ikke giftig
» the neighbour asked
This means «Why are you (two) not poisonous
Gift=married
Giftig=poisonous
Lmao
Reminds me of tadpoles in Norwegian (rumpetroll) which literally means ass-troll
It might be regional, I don't know
She explained that it meant the same as the Norwegian word "pusle (med)". I'm probably paraphrasing how she said it, but the way she said it made it crystal clear that she had been fucking all weekend (in Norwegian), and it was some version of "pula".
The only "generation" we talk about often is the "generation of '68", ie
the people who were young/students during the [protests of 1968]
Hmm, interesting
I wonder why stuff like WWII defined clearer generational boundaries (at least in the cultural perception) in the US than in Europe, where the war actually took place for the most part
That's surprising, it's very much a thing [
Dalen Hotell (in Dalen, Norway)
There was a woman who checed into the hotel while she was heavily pregnant
Upon arrival she was acting really strange, always checing over her shoulder, jumping at the slightest sounds and being just generally nervous
She stayed in room 17 over night, and when she left the next morning, she was childless, not pregnant, no child on her arm, nothing
The child was never found
Nobody knows what happened, but many guests who have stayed in the corridor room 17 is in, say they have heard baby cries in the night
Room 17 is now knows as 'The ghost room' and you can still stay there if you want to
The hotell is really pretty, so I would recomend staying here or just checking it out if you ever is in Vest-Telemark
(Fun fact: I'm at the holtell rn, in my sisters confirmation, we can't go into room 17, becuse it is locked)
Okay, so I re-read the story and the woman was Lady Greenfield from england, she was on her way home from the hotel when she was informed that she would go to court for the potentiall murder of her child, but she killed herself before the trial began
Now she is also at the hotel (something I forgot when fist posting) and I don't think she murdered her child
Or at least she felt bad about it
Because it is adviced agains placing anything in the crib in room 17
It doesn't stand what will happen if you do, but I think maybe you'll get misfortune or Lady Greenfield will appear
Men are espechally prone to notice her precence in the room
(Sorry for grammar/spelling, I'm on the phone rn)
I have a friend who was eating out in Canada
She said **SHIT** really loud
Everyone got quiet and looked at her
('Shit' is not bad at all over here, children may say it as much as they like
It basically just means "dirt".)
How strong is the phrase "Not bloody likely
What does it mean in north America I wonder
Since here it literally means "dirt".
Ah ok
So if I say "POOP" a bit too loud while in a restaurant, will I get the same reaction as when I say "SHIT"?
Some dialects here in Norway has one letter word when referring to themselves like "I"
Theres: i, e, æ, depends on where in Norway you are
Also the word for to do something i.e (å) gå, to walk
Also i = in
we’ve got the shortest place name to
which is just ‘Å’
and in older dialects we can day ‘ø’ for island
The danes have a stroke whenever they talk
They’re used to it
We have it in Norwegian too, but only with the latter definition
That word sure comes in handy
>I still hold out that their usage of the Latin alphabet is a long practical joke
Says the Brit :P
It's not rude to talk about by itself, but it's sort of rude to ask and expect an answer
Yes, it’s a bit rude
I van come off as bragging and that’s like the worst thing you can do in a social setting
I think you should always be able to talk about your income
It's rude to brag about it, but as a part of cenversation about work or life in general it is just another subject that should be broached
With close family it isn't an issue, but it's not a deeply discussed issue with friends as most of us earn nothing as students or veeeery little
I'm pretty open person as long as others share first and I don't feel like I'm being used
Also everyone's income can be checked online, so if you're really interested you can check how much they earn
Though those you check will get an update that you have accessed their earnings
I think they are about equally as common in Norway
Those are the best
Samí is an official language here
I think
And I can't speak it at all
But most Samí people can speak Norwegian
Yeah they walk alone to school, if the school is close enough to walk or course
I walked alone (without parents, but with my sister who also went to the same school) from second grade
For children living in walking distance to the school it's common to walk alone to school from the age of 7
And bicycle to school from the age of 10
Yes they walk alone in the city but it also depends on the age
If both were to be combined it's probably one of us (scandinavians), but maybe not the Danes, probably Iceland
Iceland is not Scandinavian, you’re thinking of the Nordic countries
I disagree
Alcohol is a major part of Nordic culture, and we all produce a lot
But of course I would have to see some statistics to be sure
While it is true Scandinavia means just Norway, Sweden and Denmark in our countries, it is often used for all of the Nordic countries elsewhere
You would be surprised to see how little we actually drink compared to other countries, even though it's ingrained in our culture, the normal consumption is just starting to return (i.e not getting shitfaced only on weekends), and at that we are worse than the brits but still pretty bad
An linguistics expert once said that if we found a Norwegian Viking in a glacier and was able to get him back to life, the closest to understanding what he said would be to get an Icelandic person to speak to him
Because we spoke the same language 1000 years ago, then Norway was occupied by Swedes and Danes etc and our language changed
In Iceland they kept their language more intact because they are an island and better at preserving their language
And I as a Norwegian can not understand what an Icelandic person speak today
True, although an Icelandic person would have trouble with speaking to someone
It's only the written form and grammar that is similar
And the language did not change *because* we were occupied the language here changed
It did anyway due to our own developments
Some dialects seem to have changed "hestarnir" to "hestannje" already by 1350
Norwegians could've understood speaking back to around 1400 or so (sounds like a weird dialect) but the spelling pre-1500 would be too Old Norse and incomprehensible
Pre-1350 Old Norse would be much too foreign
Norwegian today, at least bokmål, is a modified version of Danish, and I as a norwegian, can not understand a Danish person either
Most of the evolution in Scandinavia is due to internal sound changes, not German influence
Which makes sense since you mostly only have the sound changes you start yourself on the island
While dialects like mine in Norway have our own, in addition to some that might start in Western Norway and spread here, another that might start in Northern Sweden and spread here, and one starting in Western Sweden before spreading here
Just more potential for changes to arrise and spread
Danish
Pfftthh
The Danish got a collective potato stuck in their throats hundreds of years ago and none of us can understand them anymore
If they get that potato out, they might be still speaking Icelandic or Norwegian
Who knows
Getting the traditional bashing of other Scandinavian countries out of the way: That was a really interesting anecdote
Since climate change is melting ice everywhere, stay alert in case we do actually bring a viking frozen in a glacier back to life, please
...and by the way - I don't mean to offend you (in case I am horribly wrong) - but is your user name "Midweek days" in English
Because that is what it looks like with a bit of imagination in Norwegian, all tho we would spell it as "Midtukedager".
If it is, it is a good example of how the same language developes into different languages over the centuries :)
I know there are Icelandic dialects that did not do the  Bjarni > Bjartni/Bjatni thing, so those would be a candidate
As well as they who didn't change hv > kv
Besides that I think the whole island is kinda uniform in those other aspects
In fact south-western Norway have the same á > au and ll > dl/dd as well
I'm from the west coast of Norway and some dialect words are similar to Icelandic
But your letters that we (no longer) use makes them harder to recognise
Not really a calque, but Norwegian doesn’t have the rounded w-sound English has, and some people overuse it a lot in English
They’ll say «TW», «Wiolin» and «wictory».
Learn instead of teach
"I will learn you to play chess". Norwegian uses the same word for both
It sounds like baby-talk, yes
Actually, we don't have English's v-sound either
The Norwegian <v> is in between /w/ and /v/ phonetically
It is a *[voiced labiodental approximant] (IPA: ʋ)
So, in English, we tend to mispronounce both sounds
I was in Denmark for a music festival
We'd been there two weeks already and I was tired, and couldn't be bothered to try to understand danish at the moment so I switched to English with the guy selling beer
We small talked a bit and he asks where I'm from
Turns out we were from the same small city in Norway
At the moment we don't have any national ID card, apart from the normal passports
However, making one has been a plan since 2007, postponed a number of times it seems to be on the road to releasing, along with new passports in fall this year
[Here] is a draft of how it will look
Is it just me or it won't have *personnummer*?
Long time ago I could use my bank card as ID, but the last one with a photo on it was probably at least 15 years ago
Driving license usually works though
Edit: who calls us ["Norga"] I wonder
> who calls us "Norga" I wonder
Are you trolling or genuinely wondering
Bokmål first followed by Nynorsk
Some of the designations has the same spelling so only one is used
I'm guessing he's genuinely wondering, as while I'm sure it's Sami, it's not a language you encounter at all unless you're in the north
I actually have no idea
I only know about Norra (Estonian), Noruega, Norway, Norge and Noreg
The languages are Bokmål, Nynorsk, Northern Sami and English
Wouldn't it be Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo
If we remove sweden and denmark it would be Bergen or Christiania/Oslo through most of that time period
Well yes but adding the largest City in current day norway during those years makes sense
First grade of primary school when you are 6, then you have to have it for 11 years
YouTube is who I dedicate my skills to as watching videos with no subtitles really helped my understanding of the language
South Park
Lots of South Park
I began at 10 years old
I had classes until I was 18
When I was 23 I started watching movies on DVD with English subtitles instead of Norwegian which is my mother tongue
I also had a friend living in London at the time and visited him several times and got to practise when I was there
Now I use Reddit and I still watch series and movies with English subtitles if I’m watching alone
Edit: And I have a British neighbour at the moment, that helps me practice my small talk skills
I started learning English at the age of 6, just like every other Norwegian first grader did after the 1997 reform
I’d already been exposed to a lot of English, mostly in the form of music but also some movies
Living in Spain helped me improve a lot, as I didn’t know any Spanish when I moved there
Not everyone in Spain speaks English, but I had to use it more than I would have if I stayed in Norway all my life
Not only speaking and understanding spoken English, but casual everyday reading too, like menus at restaurants and such
I’ve always loved to read and since it was difficult to get a hold of books in Norwegian in Spain I had to read in English (e-books weren’t really a huge thing back then, and also e-books suck)
I’d say that I’ve been mostly fluent in English since I was 13/14 ish
My Spanish is still shit though
You start English classes during your first school year in Norway (when you’re 5-6yrs) and continue until your first year of high school
So for the younger generation, you start learning it at a very young age, and with the growing presence of video games, mostly in English, many learn quite a bit through video games as well
At least I certainly did when I was younger
Began learning it in school in 4th grade
Nowadays however kids start learning it in 1st grade, and by the time they become teenagers they mix a lot of English words into their Norwegian
(Due to gaming, movies
In Norway we start at 3rd or 4th grade in elementary school learning English
So around 9-10 years old I guess
I've always liked English so I've learned a lot by reading and listening to music
It also helped a lot that I was making English comics at like 12-13 years old
I'm a lot online and have made some friends that I have to speak/write English with
Now I'm studying something that is taught in English and also has some international students so I have to talk English to them, so I'm happily improving speaking English too
I knew a few english words from kindergarten, but I started learning english in 1st grade (6 years old)
I improved my reading in school and my spoken english through movies, TV and youtube
when i found minecraft YouTubers at the age of 6
Very early
I spoke English almost fluently by the time i was 10-11
It's probably because i grew up watching english speaking movies and tv shows
I remember watching shows like 7th heaven, Home And Away and macgyver every day after school
I also grew up going on vacations to Greece, Turkey, Spain and the UK
That helped me practise speaking English
My grammar isn't as good as my English speaking though
In Norway, learning english at school starts at age 6
I probably learned some english during kindergarten, and then in school, all the way from 6 to 15 year old and up
I remember a point where i wrote "fuck you bich" on IRC and someone told me i should learn proper english before trying to insult someone in english
After that i got my shit together and started learning english better so i could insult people without being told my english suck
Also, using irc and Linux since the age of 13-14 really forced me to learn pronounciation, and how to formulate questions properly
This i think is the main source of my english skills
Watched movies and tv-series that are not dubbed, communicated with english speakers, read english books
I think my generation started of with cat, dog, etc
in our second year of elementary, when we were 7-8 years old
20 years have gone by since I started to learn english, and a lot has changed, from being a kid that went online for the first time, to reading and hearing english every day
I don’t really need subtitles when watching English-speaking movies, but I’m kinda insecure, so I’m afraid I’ll miss out on something if I don’t have them
I have quiet a few English books in my shelf
In first grade (age 6), but I wasn't fluent in English until I was 8 or 9
I improved by watching TV-series and movies, also by reading English on the internet
It's a bit of a special case, but I grew up in the Middle East, up until I was 11 years old, with a Norwegian father and a French Canadian mother, and also an Indian housemaid
So I grew up learning to speak all three languages from the start
I have distinct memories of having English classes in 1st grade, so I was like 5-6
I was quite lucky as a child because one of my best friends was American living in Norway
She spoke Norwegian, but she also taught me a lot of English, introduced me to music and movies that I probably wouldn’t have been aware of if I didn’t know her
After she moved back to the US, I was always interested in English and took it very seriously in school
As a teenager I started reading a lot of English books and obviously spent time of the internet (YouTube, Tumblr and Twitter)
I think we started in 3rd grade, at age 9
When did you go to school
These days Norwegian kids learn English in school starting in 1st grade
Weird, we also started with English classes in 1st grade (2006 in my case)
Im 23 now so it doesn't surprise that they've started earlier now, it's a good thing in my opinion
Thinking if they for example go on vacation somewhere and maybe accidentally get lost and have to ask for help
I was 9 in 2006, but I can't remember any English education before that
I started 2008 and also started English in first grade
I'm 26 and I have distinct memories of English class in 1st grade, but maybe it was more up to the school back then
Since Kunnskapsløftet (2006) we have had goals for English after year 2
I find that kids these days pick up a lot of English from the media (Youtube, TikTok, gaming) and sometimes they're actually better at English than their teachers, lol
(I'm a teacher)
Maybe it differed around the country
We didn't learn that much obviously, it was extremely basic, but we learned things like names of fruits and colors
Yeah
Internet and stuff is a lot more accessible for kids now than it was for us when we were younger, so I get they can pick up a lot of stuff from there with those things you mentioned (I almost forgot about those lol)
I started school in 2008
Totally
It's funny, I work with a lot of kids with autism and for some reason a lot of them actually speak more English than Norwegian
With good reason - A lot of them consume a lot of music and riddles on Youtube that obviously are in English
Broadly
I can usually pick a Scandinavian, or a Southern European, Slavs, English etc
It can be a bit more difficult smack bang in the middle of western Europe, but mannerisms, dress, eyes/hair/skin can hint at nationality
The Dutch are often easy to spot
They're a lot blonder than I would have expected
Tall too
Germans have a certaind
Mannerism
Scandinavians have big heads/faces with high cheekbones
Spaniards look different to the Greeks, too
But I can't tell you exactly what sets Europeans apart in appearance, apart from the obvious
I guess you start to recognise patterns in features and mannerisms
I'm also pretty good at telling Asians apart too
I can struggle a bit with differentiating between Thai/Vietnamese, but I can pick an Indonesian no worries
Chinese and Japanese look quite different, but I can be tripped up by Koreans, but I do have an idea of what features to looks for there
Someone should make a website or something with pictures of people and you guess their country
Would be interesting to see the results
Sometimes, but it can be tricky
A guy from Spain working in my children's school looks like he is from the middle east
A Norwegian friend looks French
My South African husband is mistaken for Norwegian all the time, until he starts speaking
(His forefathers came from Germany, Netherlands and France
Plus one person who was traced back to Denmark)
Not by facial features, but it's quite easy to tell from haircut and dress
Eastern european men quite often have a buzz cut hair style
Poles, Baltic people or Russians  will be easily recognized by their track suits
Hungarians, Bulgarians or Romanians have the same hair cut, but often substitute the track suit with camo pants, while people from the balkans all have black leather jackets (this also goes for the southeast europeans)
Eastern european women will often dress a bit too provocative for my taste
You'll often see them wear high heels even in mid-winter
Furs or leather are a definitive sign
French people dress distinctly different from anybody else
Light colours, light materials, elegantly dressed
Spanish and Italians also dress in light fabrics, but are way more coloured than the French
The germans are a different sort
I think they're getting better at it year by year, and they've come far from the socks-in-sandal stereotype
But they're still easily spottable with their dark coloured fabrics and practical clothes
Hair is always a bit too long
They will inevitably have an all weather jacket
Ducth people are a bit difficult to tell
Probably because they look too similar to us Scandinavians
And then there's the british
I can't put my finger on exactly what it is, but they,'re just a tad bit tackier than the rest of Europe
I Can tell Scandinavians, British and Portuguese/Spanish(can tell if they are either Spanish or Portuguese, but cannot tell if they are Portuguese or Spanish) apart most of the time
The French and Italians I typically mix up
I can tell who is British most of the time
And I mix up most Eastern European people
(mostly northeast Europeans) South east(Greece, Croatia, Turkey etc) I can not tell apart
It depends, I can recognize Scandinavians easily and is usually correct
My stepdad has studied the face shape,  headshape, traits (?? like eye shape, nose) etc
of different nationalities/regions so I've learnt some of that too
It's easy to see if someone is from eastern Europe but I'm not good at specifically where
Tbh I find it easier to guess the nationality of people from Asia/SE Asia lol
It was probably the sitting alone in a corner that gave him away
My first thought too
(Maybe it's more difficult when you have the same accent
Their beauty
Recycle ALL aluminium
Reusage of aluminium requires much less energy than the production of new aluminium
The obvious ones:
Bring a reusable bottle everywhere for coffee and water etc
But non-package food like fruits and vegetables and bring your own package for it
Bring your own bags everywhere
Only accept basgs when absolutely necessary
Buy used
Wether it’s clothing or appliances, almost anything can be bought used
And for what you cannot buy used, look for more sustainable ingredients
Like bamboo toothbrush or underwear
The more cotton the better
100% cotton is the best
Never use one-use products unless absolutely necessary
I don’t know your gender, but if you’re a girl consider period-cup
I have never used one but it supposedly also reduces your money spent as you only need 1
Public transport, let your car stay when you don’t actually need it
Don’t fly as much
That’s about all I can think of
And remember don’t strive for perfection
Any effort is better than none
Don't buy new clothes if you don't need them, especially cotton
The clothing industry is one of the biggest polluters out there
- Owls in the moss (Ugler i mosen) = something seems suspicious
- As herring in a barrel (som sild i tønne) = people gathered tightly in a small area
- To meet the wall (å møte veggen) = to be exhausted / burned out
- To get iron curtain (å få jernteppe) = to completely forget what you wanted to say
- Take it completely piano (ta det helt piano) = To take it easy
- Cat in a bag (Katta i sekken) = when you didn't get (bought) what you expected (for instance when you bought a car that turned out to be in a much worse conditions than you expected)
Edit: spelling
We have an idiom that is weird because we misheard the danish
In Norway we have "owls in the moss" It means that something suspicious is happening
But it was supposed to be wolves in the swamp
Sry danes, we norwegians love to mishear ur idioms
"stå med skjegget i postkassa" - literally "to stand with your beard stuck in the mailbox"
Used for saying that you messed up and now you have to deal with the consequences kinda
Like "you could buy the wrong car, and then you'll stand there with your beard in the mailbox"
Also to do someone a "bear favour" (bjørnetjeneste)
It's when you do someone a favour, but it backfires and ends up giving them more grief than help
We also have some from my region:
- Ta deg ei pera (Take a pear) = sort of a mikstur between get lost and get over it
- Herlega London (Wonderful London) = When you are slightly resigned and just need to vent a bit
E. g. Have you seen the new Christmas decoration
Wonderful London, it's just a bit much
- Satt det håve på ei ku, då hadde ikkje melkå blitt gode (if that head was on a cow, then the milk would not have been good) = When somebody is stupid
«Å drite på leggen» (=to shit on the calf)
It means you’ve embarrased yourself big time
«Snakker om sola, så skinner den» (=speak of the sun and it will shine)
Similar to «Speak of the devil, and he shall appear»
Never take everything for good fish
I also have some:
Å sitte med skjegget i postkassa (sitting woth your beard in the mailbox) = to be stuck in a tricky situation
Gullhår i ræva (golden hair in your ass)= used when someone is very lucky
Ikkje selg skinnet før bjørnen æ skutt (don't sell the skin before the bear is shot)= Don't make a deal before you know it can be done
Those are the ones I can remember right now
(I'm fron Eastern Norway btw)
We have a corresponding one in Norwegian
"Fra asken til ilden" - From the ashes to the fire
Norwegian has "skyte spurv med kanoner" (shooting sparrows with cannons) for the same situations
Similar to ours
Don't make a feather into five hens
Bog is "myr" in Norwegian
We use the 'Ta deg ei pera' only that we use 'Bolle' instead
Ah, those are nice local ones
The last one I have actually never heard
When I was a child (west-coast), and my mum got angry, she used to say:
- "Det er nå hov på hesten om han er nå langt nede
" (The horse has a hoof (?), even if it's far down" = Now I am totally outraged
- "Hvis du ikke gjør som jeg sier blir det MÅNELYST
" (If you are not doing as you are told now the moon will start shining) = Well
then we knew it was time to do as we were told
We actually never dared to test beyond this point
(..and this one works well on my own children too by the way
) :)
> «Å drite på leggen» (=to shit on the calf)
That expression must originate from the time before everyone had outhouses (utedo)
That's a good one
West-Coast here as well, never heard the first one, but Månelyst is serious business
The last one of mine I had never heard until I visited my in laws (who are farmers) and a neighbor was visiting
The first one I believe comes from the north-west (nord-Møre
Språkrådet (the language council)
They are in the lucky position of maintaining two different written variants of the same language
They add new words as they are invented, and also makes an effort to translate English tech terms to Norwegian, with varying luck
Språkrådet is the official institute for any matter of the Norwegian language in both forms (bokmål and nynorsk)
They’re issuing thoughts on new words, imported words, names, tendencies, further development of the language and different dialects etc
They do also issue guidance for good use of Norwegian
We do also have at least two unofficial organisations concerning language questions, Riksmålsforbundet and Noregs Mållag
The first takes care of questions related to bokmål and more traditional Norwegian, while the latter takes care of anything related to nynorsk and dialects
They are particularly interest organisations which aim at ensuring a stable or plural language in Norway and that the language in its different forms and dialects persists
Noregs Mållag is today the most active of the two for that matter
Yeah, in that case you misunderstood
Several beaches in Lofoten looks breathtaking, just don't expect warm water
There's some pretty good pictures on [this site]
[Kvalvika beach]
All of our beaches will kill you
(Iceland)
norway isn’t exactly know for its beaches but along the oslofjord the beaches are really good, there’s a few islands outside the cities of tønsberg and sandefjord that’s super nice
It should be mentioned that the longest beaches are probably found south of Stavanger, from Sola down to Brusand
Several decent sand beaches
Definitely not as pretty as the Lofoten ones though
And the North Sea isn't exactly known for its tropical water temperatures
Yeah good point
That looked pretty epic, hope you manage to get up there one day
Kaizers Orchestra, definitely
They played a folk/indie-rock in the Jærsk dialect, and they have a bunch of really catchy tracks: my favourite songs from them are Resistansen, Stormfull Waltz and 170
[Norwegian Reggaeton]
It is from an Italian band, so not Norway, but they sing about Black Metal and Scandinavian culture
Also most lyrics are in Spanish with a few English verses, and the memes and jokes are so well layered
Add to this the fact that the song is catchy as hell and packs a punch, and you have the most hilarious summer hit ever
Böse Onkels too, right
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl
Bodø vs Tromsø on what city is the best in northern Norway (Spoiler: it's Bodø)
I hear that in Ajax vs Feyenoord matches they have walls between each club's supporters
And that one of the groups perform some quite racist gestures towards the others
No Tromsø is the better city
Tromsø is definitely better
Bodø beats us only in football, trains and wind
I would also say that the rivalry between the north and the south of Norway always has been huge
A lot of stadiums have designated away fans sections with fences around the travelling fans
Also the universities, Nord universities administration in Vesterålen suuuuucks, i quit and started all over again through UiT
I know many that did the exact same thing, mostly felt like we weren’t taken seriously as students, especially when covid hit
The dialects I remember from Nemo is that the sharks talk Bergensk, as many cartoon villains did
At least it seems like they've moved away from the trope in recent years
Don't a lot of villains also have a bit of a Sunnmøre-dialect as well
Also rural rednecks tend to get dubbed with inland dialects like Hedmark and Oppland
Bergensk and Scanian both have the gutteral R in common
If you're good at it, you can pinpoint almost exactly where someone is from by listening to their dialect
Drive through Norway and you'll get a new dialect every 30 minutes, and unlike a lot of other countries we tend to keep our dialects no matter what setting, education, work etc we have
With modern media our vocabulary has gotten more uniform across the country, but pronunciation can still vary quite a bit
I don't know this for sure, but I have heard something about Norway having the most different dialects in the world or something
They are very different in the different regions of the country and we also have the same thing where ever village and town have their own variations
In Norway the dialect (at least in the west) changes at almost every town, city and island
Yep
Norway too
We sound wildly different, even from town to town
Yes
If I drive one hour away from where I live people will talk differently
We do
I could travel fifteen minutes and end up somewhere with a different dialect to mine
We have some major dialects for every county, and then every commune and town has their own variations and words
Yes
I = jeg, eg, æ, æg, i, ei, e..
Edit: forgot a couple: jæ, jæi, jej, ek
If you’re bad at it, you might struggle understanding people
Especially from the more secluded areas who’ve not been influenced as much by the big “oslo-dialect”
Same with Norway vs Sweden with regards to few people with many dialects vs many people with few dialects
The deciding factor seems to be the mountains
Same in Norway, probably the mountains are to blame
That's a bit of a myth, it's impossible to count
It's more that we use the dialects more than many others and they are more visible
Never heard of ek before
Where do they say that
True
I'm more of a mix of multiple, but my dialect is mostly ytre sogn
But a bunch of people throughout my life have asked my if I'm from Bergen based on it
Certain people from the Stavanger area
Now try watching this:
same, and i’m norwegian
i live here now and the first week was like moving to another country
I'm from Stavanger
I've never heard anyone say ek
Doesn't make much sense considering we usually pronounce k's as g's, so "ek" would be the opposite of the norm
Well, to an outsider it can definitely sound like "Ek" at times
Oh wow interesting to see
During the time the vikings where a bit mean to the UK, they must have influenced some words
Of course what they spoke is not what Norwegian is today, but both Foss and Skrike is Norwegian words meaning Waterfall and Scream
It's called "standard østnorsk", and it's just a generic Oslo area dialect
The brown rat also known as the "norwegian rat", *rattus norvegicus* in Latin, has nothing to do with Norway
Its origin is most likely somewhere around the Caspian sea
Drinking age is 20 in Denmark
TIL
The opinions of people who are so incredibly uninformed are already worthless
Less than one percent of people believe concentration camps were Polish, and the other 99 percents know those people are clueless idiots
Norsk or Norwegian we basically learn how to write and speak Norwegian but I guess this was pretty obvious
I would be very surprised if there are schools in Europe which don't teach about different religions
We also have that in Norway but it’s just about food, I think it included more stuff before but was mostly just for the girls now it is for everyone
Why is revolution history seperate from history in general
We don’t have sløyd as a individual subject but it is includes in arts and crafts
We can also choose our own subject from 8-10 grade
We had it as a seperate subject in "barneskolen" but it became a part of arts and crafts later
Yes thats true we learn the other writing form and I don’t know of any other countries that have multiple writing forms in one language
I’ve been there
Beautiful city
There aren't any here as far as I know
The reason might be that historically norway (and sweden) fought on the sea and attacked coast cities
So they didnt have any use for the mainland territories
I wouldnt go as far to say mainland territories were useless everywhere but they were in norway and sweden at that period
Norwegian, Danish, English 100%
Kind of surprised by only understanding maybe 96% Swedish, but damn you have some strange words
I was able to understand the context in German, sometimes even full sentences
I understood some Dutch and Afrikaans, but not enough to get the context, and only rarely full sentences
Same with Icelandic
Low German and Bavarian were the hardest
tried dutch, icelandic and afrikaans
strangely enough i could basically understand everything in afrikaans
i could understand most of the icelandic stuff but the different letterings made it hard and dutch was the hardest
Basically everything
Understand only the 3 on top
+ English
I understand basically all of Swedish and Danish, I get the German, and I get the general fist of Flemish, but not much
I can understand 100% of the Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and English articles, around 50% of the sentences in the German and Icelandic articles, and only a few words in the others
I can undestand most Germanic languas better than they understand Norwegian
I find it weird that you understand Danish better than Norwegian
Norwegian and swedish is well understood by both sides verbally
But the written language is a bit different
Norwegian and Danish is fairly hard to understand by both sides verbally, but the written language is just about identical
Really
Danish and Norwegian spelling is almost identical
Only pajamas
Yeah baggy sweatpants
I do wear sweatpants outside but it's mostly the slimmer ones that look a bit more presentable
I have a pair of baggy grey sweatpants that I would only wear at home
I have a Minecraft tee that's not seen sunlight since I bought it eight or so years ago
I'm wearing it rn
Not because they're not nice, they're bought specifically to be worn at home
Clothes that exist only for comfort and can be ugly as sin
Yes definitely
Nice enough so I can open the door if someone rings the doorbell, but still comfy
Absolutely
Every day, first thing I do when I get back to my flat is undress and throw on a pair of sweatpants and an old Hard Rock Café tee
No need to look good if I'll just be cleaning or lounging
My one piece that's wayyy too big, and my make-shift sith costume
Nah, I wear nice jeans, hoodies, sweaters, shirts and the like at home as well
The same as outside
I hate sweatpants and ugly t-shirts, and I hate feeling and looking sloppy— even at home
So I try to wear and look my best when outside and even at home
It’s also much more comfortable for me that way, and that makes up for it that I feel much better about myself
Fine clothes can be comfortable as well
There's a children's song from the 50s called "Vesle Hoa". It's about a black boy saving his tribe
Has the n-nord and everything
It's overall very problematic
[Maybe this one as well]
most neighbors have some beef i think, like russian and ukraine/finland, norway and denmark/sweden, austrian and it’s former empire, germany and poland etc
sometimes it’s more light hearted and not as serious but sometimes it can be a genuine anger towards each other
I play lots, and I mean lots of hoi4 and I have prob only played Norway twice
Boring ass country
I play every single nation although I like Italy and Germany because I can take over Europe
Mare Vôtrum
Longest city/town name I could think of is Stjørdalshalsen
Not particulary long
We do however have a very short one, [Å.]
The longest Norwegian place-name I could find is Kvernbergsunds-Ødegaarden
It's not a city/town name though
The shortest name of a village in Norway: Å. (Pronounced as the O in John)
We have Å as well so it's a tie
Yeah, I know it's strange
How would you intuitively pronounce it
Yes, that's an even better description
The circle avobove the A makes all the difference
We can also entertain you with such letters as Ø (as in noef) and Æ (as in bad)
I don't take offense
It's probably just as hard for a french to pronounce Norwegian as it is for a Norwegian for pronounce French
Probably even harder, as we probably observe more of your culture, eat your food, learn it in school, travel there, watch Tour de France etc which makes us learn at least SOME
But your grammatic, that's just messed up, monesieur
Pardon, mademoiselle
The Tour de France is HUGE outside France too
I'm watching every stage from start to finish after work, my TV system let's me watch things that has already  been on TV
Sometimes this makes me sit up late into the night, but I enjoy it
This year a Norwegian even won stage 1 and went into the maillot jaune
We've had 5 guys winning stages: Dag Otto Lauritzen won on Bastille Day 1987, Thor Hushovd won a lot in the 2000-2010's, Kurt Asle Arvesen won one stage, Edvald Boasson Hagen has won 3 stages (I think) so far, Alex Kristoff has won 4 so far
I can go on and on about the subject
Honestly I don't remember the latest French winner
There has been 3  British winners: Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome (technically he's Kenyan), and Geraint Thomas (All from Team Sky)
Edit; Last French winner was in 1985, Bernard Hinault
I hope to go to St
Petersburg
I’ve dreamt about it all my life
Probably won’t come true this year, but it would be nice to go when everything is up and running and my wallet is a little thicker
London
I had a trip booked for this June and I had to cancel
I really wanted to get a trip in before Brexit went through
I probably won't be properly traveling for a good while, but I'm moving home to my dad in a couple weeks, as I'm almost finished with my degree, and there are absolutely no jobs at the moment so I can't pay for an apartment
I might continue on a Masters degree in the fall, and I'll have to move out again, but who knows if I get accepted
Other than that I'm really overdue for a visit of my mom's side of the family in Canada
It's been four years since the last time I've seen them
Hopefully I can do it next Christmas
Do you mean Stavanger
Stavern is a tiny town on the south eastern coast
Definitely a nice place to visit, but it's no city
Trust me, if I'm able to travel in October (half term for schools) I will be going to London
\*Clarity
I know
Stroopwafels are so much better than donuts
Any reason to visit Stavern is as good as any other
It's a pretty little town
Fair points
I have actually yet to taste real stroopwafels
I have only tasted a store bought variant my friend used to bring while we studied at uni
I just love everything pancake like
Really looking forward to visiting the Netherlands one day and eating real ones
No, but they are waffel/pancake like in terms of ingredients
In Norway at least, Waffels are very like pancakes
Only fried in different types of irons
The Belgian Waffel is clearly different
And the biscuit in a cone ice cream is called Vaffelkjeks (Waffel biscuit) and is just a dreid variant of the vaffel
Added the last part after I had written the initial comment, but you probably didn't see it
Waffels can be both soft and crunchy, just depends on how you make them
I agree that the syrop filled middle differs though
I understand your point of view
I have tried to make them at home, eaten the store-bought and Googled them (I am really looking forward to tasting the real deal)
Most likely, we just have a different definition about what Waffels are
However, when I eventually taste them, if I realize I was wrong, I will find this comment and send you a PM admitting I was wrong and you were right :)
Do you recommend any special place to buy them if I travel to Amsterdam
These are the store bought I have tasted:
An American one, from Texas
My neighbour had his car shipped over here
He had lived and worked in Texas for 5 years and just moved back
He's got Norwegian plates now though
Wait
Swedes also say "Helt Texas"? Cool
I dont really know the cost
However this guy did know someone and they did it pretty cheap for him
Something about them already transporting stuff, and they had room for the car so why not
It's an expensive car, but definitely not impossible to get
It's a Porsche (don't know the model) and I've seen that exact Porsche at the dealership that's 10 minutes down the road
If it is a new car, you have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in import tax, but it is not necessarily "expensive" locally in Norway - since if you want to drive that car in Norway all other similar cars also have the same taxes added to the purchasing price
But it is expensive with US eyes - US market prices
An extreme example: There is a 2020 Ford F-150 Shelby SuperSnake pickup truck with no miles for sale in Norway right now (a big truck with a huge engine is basically the worst you can buy in Norway tax wise)
It costs $220,000 if you take out the back seats and register it as a 2 seater working truck
With the backrow of seats in the crewcab, as a 5 seater, that truck costs $290,000
Compared to the US those prices are wild, but if you live in a society where that is the price, only a handful of people would consider buying it and some rich person will
Because he or she will have pretty much the only or one of a few cars like that in Norway
And when you sell it, you can sell it for much more than US msrp
The only thing you can't do, is export it back to the US because then you lose the local market price of the car
And now you know why Norwegians buy Teslas that hardly have any import taxes :) They are relatively "cheap" since fossil fuel cars are so heavily taxed
(The F-150 example was just an extreme result of the tax system, other cars are not that heavily taxed)
Actually, last year they changed the veteran import tax rule
We now can import any car older than 20 years old relatively tax free
"Alfakrøll" or "krøllalfa" - alpha roll / roll alpha
When reading it can just be "at".
A more accurate translation is "alpha curl/curl alpha". But yeah, most people just say "at".
Says the kanelbulle country
I don't think most people say "at".
Perhaps not
I know they use the it in media, but other than that, I can't remember the last time someone said "krøllalfa" when giving their mail adress
It's either "at" or nothing in my experience
I do a lot of work in peoples houses, and when I am asking them for an email so I can send the invoice, they only use "krøllalfa" and sometimes "alfakrøll".
I usually cheer for Denmark/Russia/Sweden after Norway
New Zealand if they’re there
>Everyone hates Petter Northug
Get over him, Sweden
He retired last year
It's Klæbo that's beating you now :)
We never get into the world cup or european championship so I was cheering Iceland on in both 2016 and 2018
In football I'll find another nation out of pure necessity:
Norway
Iceland
Denmark (lived there)
Sweden
A random team that is fun to watch
We root for Denmark and Sweden also, but not in winter sports
Loosing is not an option, and loosing to Sweden is a national tragedy
You guys don´t even qualify as a challenge ;)
> Well, I can't say that I cheer for Sweden in hockey or other sports, but I'm not one of those pathetic bastards who cheer for their opponents either
I'm just neutral
Made me laugh
Thanks
> Russia
Why
Thanks
I’ve got some Russian friends
I was surprised by that too
Hey, They need some love too
Those are FUN
120km/t on snow, yes please
&#x200B;
My pappa used to dra me on rattkjelke behind his snøskuter to our former hytte when I was a barn, but ikke in 120km/t
Makes sense
Which is why I have a soft spot for Estonia and Poland
UK- How badly built English houses are- they're freezing, damp, and for some inexplicable reason sometimes have carpet in the bathroom
France- school on Saturday
Full sit down lunch at school with a starter (grapefruit), main (meat and veg) and dessert- and those lunch ladies were mean as fuck and would go around making sure we used our knives and forks properly etc
(if it's not blindingly obvious, I went to school there for a year)
Sweden (North)- how flat it is compared to Norway
How much the Northerners drink
How similar Estonians are to Nordic people
Much more so than Latvians or Russians who also are their neighbours (Estonia even has a large'ish Russian population
) Years of Soviet rule did not remove or change their Nordic'ness
this explains why I always feel so comfortable in Germany
A pub lady in the UK however called me "Love" once
Yes
I haven't lived in Romania, but travelled in Transylvania a bit
The food was amazing
[This photo comes to mind
When do you eat breakfast
I'm guessing farm life, which is again dictated by sunlight
We start work earlier, go home earlier, thus eat earlier
But here 'supper' is a staple (kveldsmat, literal translation evening food), so meals happen about 4 times a day
I've lived in about 6 different countries, and I think the warmer thr climate, the later you eat (roughly)
That also translates into longer periods of sunlight
> I'm used to dine somewhere between 8pm and 9pm
All my kids are in bed by 9
When to Portuguese children go to bed
>  other times I feel perplexed how many people are just unable to be dynamic about situations
Please give an example
Or two
Oh, I also a short three month stint in Ireland, and please tell me ladies--why do you wear so much makeup
And why is is bright orange
> UK- How badly built English houses are- they're freezing, damp, and for some inexplicable reason sometimes have carpet in the bathroom
I haven't lived in the UK myself, but all my Norwegian friends who have lived there (a good few
) said the same thing
They had mold in their houses, water damage, constant dampness, etc
Moving further north from Spain or Italy must be a huge shock food-wise, even to countries where cooking from scratch is more common than in the UK
British cuisine = a melting pot of historical Commonwealth and British Empire cuisine
> I felt like dying from hunger by the time they would be having their lunch
Same
I think your inner clock gets used to 11:00 somehow
> You put water in your coffee
What do you do
Chew on it dry
> UK- How badly built English houses are- they're freezing, damp, and for some inexplicable reason sometimes have carpet in the bathroom
I remember seeing some tv-show about council housing (a very interesting topic in it's self), and one apartment building had a build up of water on the ground outside (drainage didn't work properly)
and the water somehow travelled up the wall and caused a damp problem on the second floor
Very fascinating
I had no idea water can climb up brick buildings
That being said I have only visited people in the UK living in brand new building complexes where there were no damp problems
Nope
The whole fucking bathroom
It was a nightmare, as I liked taking baths
I shudder to think what was growing in there
I think the moisture is what makes it so cold
Once the damp gets into your bones, it's done
It's quite common in the Nordic countries
I think it actually comes from the old meal times when most people lived on a farm
It was common to have a small meal around 10 or 11, between the very early breakfast  at 6 AM and dinner at 1 PM
Nowadays, people have their lunch at that time instead
Work days start early here, and it is not uncommon to be at the office around 7
30 AM
Many people skip breakfast too, and start to get hungry around 10 or 11
It's quite common to have an office snack around 2 PM too, in order to keep it going till dinner around 5 or 6 PM
Getting to work early requires an early lunch, and allows us to head home at 3
30 PM while still putting a full work day
Oh, I wasn't aware of that
In Norway there is often an English alternative
My husband prefers to get his tax papers in English for instance
Yup
To add to this: the Norwegian word for dinner is "middag", which literally means "the middle of the day". Half the year we have very little sunlight, I'd guess that's a factor
The traditional meals during summer are:
* Åbit - a small snack at 6 AM before the work started
* Frokost - Breakfast, taken around 8
30 AM
* Dugurd - A smaller meal, at around 11 AM
* Middag - A full meal, around noon or 1 PM
* Nons -  A small meal at around 3
30 PM
* Eftasverd - A cold meal between 5 PM and 6 PM
* Kvelds - A light snack before bedtime
The high number of meals shows the amount of physical work that was done during summertime, when it's light from 6 AM till 11 PM
The meals varied in size, and gave rythm to the work day
In winter time, when there's sun only from 9 AM to 4 PM, substantially less food was eaten
People were doing less work and required fewer calories
In winter, people would eat:
* Duggurd at 11 AM
* Nons at 3 PM
* Kvelds before bedtime
Sometimes people would rise in the middle of the long night to have a meal as well
The winter meal times corresponds to the usual meal times in the Nordic countries today
What we used to called *middag* (dinner) is the equivalent of lunch in other countries, but it's simply not eaten at work places anymore
Instead we've renamed the *dugurd* meal as lunch and eat that as a light meal at 11 AM instead
To a great deal of confusion for visitors from other countries
EDIT: Formatting
Yep, I found an article saying 70% of Norwegians eat dinner between 4 and 6 PM on weekdays
Obviously people can have different schedules, and Norwegians are eating their dinners later and later as we're adopting more continental habits, but this holds true for my family at least
We start making dinner the moment we get home from work and eat a little over 5
(We have young kids, so we eat before they get too tired
I get to work early so I can get off work early and perhaps catch some sun in the afternoon during spring/fall
(In winter it's always dark when I get off work anyway, but in summer I also want to get off early to enjoy the summer day and drink beer etc
Scandinavia isn't the only place where it's pretty dark at times, but I think it's shaped a lot of our habits

So we're sort of like Hobbits
Very interesting, I had heard of dugurd (duggurds where I'm from), but not åbit and nons
Sistnevnte, uttales det "nons" eller "nåns"?
That's correct
But it would probably be required in order to get enough calories to last through a long day of physical labour
Nåns med lang vokal
Many of them was cold meals with bread or lefse with something aside, reducing the need for work
This also meant that they could be eaten in the fields
(sort of what we still do when we bring a packed lunch of sandwiches to work, quite common here)
These meal times were common at farms and crofts before industrialization
Large farms would hire a lot of farm hands during the summer, and it was custom to provide food as well as boarding
The food was cooked by the farmer's wife
On large farms there would be kitchen maids and scullery maids who assisted
I don't feel anything about it
If it works for them then it is fine by me
The only one I've ever visited is Monaco, and what even is the point
What separates them from the french, or even the italians
Sure, tax exemptions and casinos and all that, but still
San Marino and Andorra are lagre enough to house their own cultures, and the vatican is a special place to put it mildly
But the most confusing one is Liechtenstein
Why are they separate from their neighbours
Liechtensteiners are a german people AFAIK, so why are they not part of either of the three nearby countries
I know my confusions are heavily stained with ignorance, but I honestly don't know/understand
Kudos to them for remaining autonomous
But they're all filthy rich aren't they
For some at least that's because they're tax havens
That's kind of shitty
To survive as a microstate is cool, to live as a parasite is decidedly uncool
I often forget them and they are very unimportant in the modern world, and it’s weird that they still exist after two world wars
I understand why the Vatican exists, it’s the most important microstate
But do we even need San Marino, Andorra, Lichenstein, Luxembourg and Monaco
But I have nothing against their existence, is just that I don’t care about them
But they are still cool and in a way nice historic monuments
It’s not corruption
It’s your ticket to heaven
Good
I hope you're doing well though
Iran has no interest of going to war, at worst they will attack some targets in Saudi Arabia
Reading the thread on r/worldnews and seeing everyone talk about WW3 just made me realise how little the average reddit user knows about politics
Sure, this does add fuel to the fire, but this is already a proxy war, and will not escalate to full blown conflict
Just another proof of that Europe need to be stronger together
The way the US acts around the globe with their wars, bombings, criminality, torture, molesting and prisoning, even with a history of shooting down passenger planes, can’t be backed and supported
The biggest losers in this game are the civilians in the poor countries they invade on various reasons and creates chaos and hell on Earth
I’m very surprised that European countries and others around the world aren’t taking more distance to these actions and talking about it
If it was say China or Russia it would be a lot of drama, initiatives to talks, condemning, boycotts, sanctions etc
But the US are always free to go on with what ever they do
The “peace” nation Norway with our brand new F35 fighters will always be prepared to help
I'm thinking Iran is gonna respond to it somehow
I just hope that this doesn't turn into an all out war
I think most other NATO members and European countries are a bit more hesitant joining anything after Libya
Medical what what what
Add: Just another sign that Norway is in the pocket of USA, buying 80 or so of the freaking most advanced fighter jets you can get, while we have almost no coverage with ships in our navy anymore with one of the longest coastlines in the world
Sssssshhhh, keep it a secret, or r/geopolitics will become just like the default subs
Maybe it was, but it has raised the awareness nevertheless
Some actually, and we were pretty forward on EV technology before it boomed, if we had kept it going today we would’ve been much more represented, maybe we will come back to that one day
Most medicines here are produced in Italy, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria or Germany as far as I know
Our scientists are actually doing breakthroughs in cancer treatment and knowledge on regular basis
We’re also working on other technologies, medical experiments and science in general, especially with other experts and institutions from other countries, you just don’t see it necessarily
Also, in our country medicines and medical care is for everyone, regardless of income, occupation, insurance etc
We’re also doing other stuff and is often a central part as negotiators or pursuers for peace and cooperation around the globe (ever heard of the Nobel Peace Price
We haven’t actively invaded many countries to get rid of their leaders and fuck things up though, haven’t nuked much people either, nor have we torture camps and rough prisons around
but we take care of many people who flee from the countries you’re destroying, maybe you should take more part in cleaning up your own mess one day soon
How much are you doing to curb global emissions
Maybe they did, but it has raised the awareness never the less
Before we mention Iraq
We all did our parts in Libya, but some of us never learn, obviously
Russia
Russia
(So USA: please stay in north of Norway
Thank you)
Sweden because Norway was invaded more than once from Sweden
No one, our neighbours are pretty chill with us
Even Russia
Statistically: Sweden
In the present situation: Russia
Possibly : US (we have oil)
Russia
100% russia
We have a border to russia far up north and it is protected by the army 24/7
Russia is a scary mother fucker
We should be scared of you, then
Statistically speaking, it really shouldn't be Russia
It's probably one of the world's longest lasting peaceful borders, as since the treaty with Novgorod in 1326, there has never been any armed conflict between Novgorod/Russia and Norway (unless you count Quisling's WW2 government as Norway, which you don't)
May I ask why
Since you are rather far away from their border
It could be Sweden
Karl XII created for a short time havoc, before he made trouble in Norway
What do you have that the US wants
Norway has land that is more eastern (easternmore
) than Finland, so maybe we’re the bad guys
Maybe it will be something like Occupied, where Russia occupies us on behalf of the EU
Yeah, those crazy Finnmark people
Sweden
I think there is greater danger of China "invading" Europe by buying up a large portion of land and businesses, than it is for the US to invade
(Although I'm sure if they find a reason to do so they might think about it
Indeed
Couldn’t have put it better myself
> a child to take care of (Norway)
Kid moved out some time ago
Well, if you dare go against the badass reindeer army
Well you could fabricate a claim on eastern Finnmark, on account of the let's say "oppressed" finnish-ethnic kveeni minority
In the town I'm from, 3/4ths of the population have finnish surnames
You could roll in with your Sisus and declare mandatory saunas for everyone, I bet that would go over well with the locals
I'd like to say he owns an oil company, but unfortunately your take on it fits fairly well, too
Well the oppression of the kveeni community isn't fabricated
But whether that oppression warrants a claim on sovereign Norwegian soil by the Finnish state is another matter
Not really
We have certain bars or restaurants that take pride in serving "working class food" or "husmannskost" as we say in Norwegian at a reasonable price, they are few and far apart
Most places to eat are these modern coffe house type places or bakeries that sell overpriced sandwitches (which are mostly air: white bread/baguettes with very little filling inside)
It is slightly changing though, some Italians opened a shop down the street from work that has a stone oven and does pizzas, panini sandwitches and also bakes bread, prices are very fair
Many older restaurants that serve simple traditional everyday food, maybe especially in less urban areas or as roadside taverns
Closest I can think of is Buffe ( buffet) but that used to be more commen when I was a child
Some hotels and the Danish ferry still have it though
> The old name for them was mjölkbar
How interesting
Concept never reached Norway
As I’ve heard they used to be around before
Could be even if I've never heard about it
I guess their hay days were in the 50s and 60s and they died out after that
Maybe someone have one somewhere just for the sake of nostalgia
[Vamp - Tirna Noir] )
That's what comes to mind if I were to think of the most beautiful song in Norwegian
[Kaizer Orchestra - Hjerteknuser] is more upbeat and catchy
All the party afterski songs I guess
Or øystein sunde songs
"Sånn er'e bare” is a funny song that mocks politicans and how they promise but never keep them :’)
I think a lot of Sami rap is pretty damn good
It retained a bit of the 90s rap style I love
A bit unrelated but this one is fun:
Splitter pine by Dumdum Boys, Sur som rognebær by Hellbillies, Toyota’n til Magdi by Karpe Diem, couple more out there some good tunes
D.D.E. – Det går likar no
En solskinnsdag
Kaizers makes bangers all over
It was very popular here for a long time
I think I still know most of the lyrics
Also Kaizers Orchestra
I diden’t even know what afterski was untill recently :’) Is it a european  thing
I was thinking og Postgirobygget but I couldn’t remember the name of the song
Røta and finaste eg veit are also cracking tunes and urban twang as an instrumental is brilliant, nice that you’ve checked them out
Thats great :) Its typical party music here :)
Gygrid
One of many Norwegianified Harry Potter words and names
Hagrid speaks an aggregated eastern Norwegian labour-class dialect in the Norwegian translations
Which probably is the most accurate given his Northern dialect originally
I think a more farmery dialect would've been a better translation of the original, but the one they chose did do the trick to make him the least posh person at Hogwarts
It depends on the use
Jukselapp if it is not allowed or sometimes even when it is allowed
At the university they were just called Notatark which means Note sheet
We had lockers for 8th-10th graders, but that was it
Not sure about other schools
We did in high school, but most books were carried in a backpack, at least if we had homework (which we often did)
But this is 20 years ago, things might be different
Not in elementary school, at least where I went, I think we just put the books in a shelf with our name on it
Junior high and high school does though, although, its not code combination, but instead you have to buy a padlock yourself, either those with just keys or those with codes on them if you want the locker shelf to be locked
Younger kids only carry home the books they need for doing homework
The rest are left in the classroom
Not sure how older kids do it
When I was that age (many moons ago) I just left all the books at home that was not needed that day
We have two each: one for books and one for shoes, jackets and stuff like that
We only had in high school, nothing before that
I guess it just depends on which school you go to
I never had a locker in my 17 years of school/studies
I had lockers from 8th to 10th grade
And in high school but for protective gear
I have never had a locker at school
I used to think students in American high school movies were so cool with their lockers and their coded padlocks :)
We had our own shelves from 1st to 10th grade and then lockers at my high school, but I know it's different from school to school
Same here (18 years)
Although I could access lockers in Uni, but they were few and always taken before I could get to them
I put my steel frame, leather made backpack on the scales when I was like
It was 5 kg
And that was just the books and stuff I needed that particular day for homework
The rest was stored in a shelf in our designated classroom
Here a 9 year old only carries the books they need to do homework
All the other books are left at school
(In shelves in the classroom)
(edit: spelling)
How does "bilione" cause problems
I’m just guessing here, but maybe it’s due to risk of confusion with English billion
According to SAS; absolutely nothing
Lack of (real) poverty
I quess beutiful nature and fjords, also probably oil
Despite being the 60th something largest country in the world, we have the second longest coastal line according to at least one list
Fjords and our awesomeness
Fish, oil and doing really good in winter games
The best in everything
Except football
Le meilleur pays quoi
The fact that we have so many dialects it’s impossible to count them all
And home of the Cyreilic alphabet
A company called Scandinavian Airlines, or SAS, made a commercial claiming that all Scandinavian culture is stolen, and that "absolutely nothing" is actually Scandinavian
[Here] is a link to said commercial
Yes, we all run our societies using the same model
Oh yeah, I think the controversy is a little overblown
The ad is more funny than anything, at least to me
I just cannot understand how they gave it the go-ahead
Its not in Norway, but I usally say have a nice day to the bus driver when I enter the bus :)
In the city, not at all
On the countryside however it's polite of say good morning, thank you
Yes, but not in the cities
When I lived more rural, I knew all the drivers and we said hey and bye and chatted a bit
Where I live now, half the time the bus drivers won't even look your way when you enter the bus
There's that occasional enthusiastic driver who says hi to everyone with great passion, but those either quit quickly or become like everyone else lol
With some exceptions
> In the city, not at all
Do not say thank you to Oslo bus drivers
You'll scare them
Technically it isn't allowed here either
But it is accepted to leave in front if nobody is coming on, or of course if the bus is too packed to leave the other end
Sadly not all people do, but to be fair its a bit difficult if its rush houer  :) and not all bussdrivers are like the classic bussdriver song :’)
I know
Did it once
Will never repeat
A buss driver, A buss driver, he is a man with good temper/mood
And if he have bad temper, then he is not a A buss driver, A buss driver is a man with good temper/mood
The driver is probably busy anyway, but Its important to try to make their day a little better :) imagne alk the kids and karens they deal with during a day
[Don't understand why it's not an eternal worldwide hit
I dos :) En bussjåfør, En bussjåfør, det er en mann med godt humør! Og har han ikke godt humør, så er han ingen bussjåfør! En bussjåfør, En bussjåfør, det er en mann med godt humør!
Kids nr 1 fav to drive the buss driver crazy on a schooltrip :’)
Yes, sometimes its difficult
The worst is if the bus is really late in winter
Its a very har job
A very thankless job too
I have met some shitty busdrivers that was very rude etc
But sadly the kind and nice onrs get ignored, cussed at or just have to deal with difficult people constantly
And they have almost no breaks even to pee
There have been times when desperate bus drivers have asked us if they could please go pee really fast
They should get more praise and respect
Its a song we can all sing together XD
Yes, poor poor drivers XD
Thats cool
Norwegian is a germanic language if im not wrong :)
China is a superpower
If we want their money, we have to accept their rules
That's how it is
The EU is often mocked for sending "strongly worded letters", well the gaming community will probably only send a few strongly worded tweets
Then everything will be forgotten
The huge backlash isn't going to actually be huge
Chinas willingness use their power however, that is huge
Blizzard can suck authoritarian chode for money all it wants, and people will let them get away with it - either by not knowing and/or not caring
Whatever miniscule backlash this has is not going to be felt fiscally, and therefore it's completely irrelevant to them
Personally I've never been particularly into anything Blizzard has ever done, but if there were an upcoming Blizz title I actually wanted I would probably be rethinking it
Norway is shaped like a sperm cell
Make of that what you want
I will also never forget that time someone accused Norway by saying that the only reason we wouldn’t join the EU is to make Sweden and Finland look like a flaccid dick on the [2 euro coin]
Make of that what you want as well
I just really like the way Austria and France looks
Austria's got this real cool shape, I don't know why France looks good it just does
Gotta give it to the Czech people and their tasty borders
I have always thought Germany looks like a head from the side, where Berlin is an eye and its mouth is wide open ready to eat Czechia
No particular reason at all
Brick Portugal
I really don't see how Sweden and Norway makes one
I am neutral on this matter
I believe, Turkey and Kurdistan shouldn't be countries at all
They could be one country, kind of like what should've happened in Korea
Of course if I was a citizen of these two countries, I would say otherwise, but right now, that's my mentality
That's not what he is saying
I agree that the Kurds deserve their own country, but it's not going to happen
No country is going to willingly give away their own territory
For the major players in the region, status quo is the desired outcome
Yes
Haven't been mistaken up till now when it comes to adults
Someone moving to a country as a young child is usually the only ones able to adopt the correct accent
I can basically always tell if someone is a native English speaker or not, and often I can tell where they're from (at least roughly)
We're exposed to so much native English in pop culture like music, movies and TV shows that it's obvious when someone isn't native
Yes
This is SO annoying to me
And confusing of and have, like in could have/should have
I learned English when I was 10
I don´t really remember what it sounded like to me then, but now it sounds soft in a «mumbly»
way, because of sounds that does not exist in Norwegian
Like «th», «w» «r» and maybe «j». We have an «r» and «j», but they are not pronounced as in Norwegian
English was one language, I did not know that it sounded different in different countries
I think I learned to hear the difference somewhere between 7th and 9th grade
I remember the teacher being frustrated because we mixed American and Brithish English
Media was mostly American, schools taught British English
English sounds to me as a language that´s related to Germanic languages, but it´s like the weird cousin that shows up to the party even though noone invited them
I wish more french people would let their accent flow
a nice french accent is pure chef's kiss
Apparnetly austrians sound like farmers in german
I've only ever heard two austrians speak english and both have really thick accents
thicker than any german i've ever heard
As somebody that have met a lot of Fins (my brother is married to one) it is extremely easy to hear it
It is the same for us Norwegians to be fair
Oh gross
In Norwegian that'd be "Lestdet"
Agreed
Every Dutch person I have ever spoken to has spoken excellent English
I sometimes get Scots and Irish mixed up until i hear the other nationality speak
like if you went "Ah dinnae want irn bru" i'd be confused until the irishman next to you said "yur creizy, iren brue is **T**he bes**t**."
Rule of thumb, Sco**t**s do hard Rs, I**r**es do hard Ts
Yeah
arseholes who can't appreciate a good accent
smh
So THAT's what they mean by 'the hills are alive with the sound of music'... I thought they were just hearing the Bavarians
As a norwegian, i sure know what it feels like to be called 'singsongy' by our national neighbors
Only you're scottish and irish
No way in hell you'd be caught with an English OR American accent
Even if you tried
We say "to bite the sour apple" but that's when you loose, not when you die
There's countless expression for dying, some unique and some probably shared with lots of other languages
"Biting (in) the grass", but I've never heard it used
We say «parkerer tøflene», park our slippers, and the same as you with the sour apple
My favourite is "parkere tøflene", to park your slippers
Biting the bullet is from [the Indian rebellion in 1857]
The world organizes the winter olympics every 4 years and tries to compete with us
Everybody here speaks the same language, but that language can be written in two ways: Nynorsk and Bokmål. This means we have two written languages, but only one spoken
As a Norwegian, whenever a danish person start talking numbers I need to switch the conversation over to English
There’s no way I understand your numbers lol
In the dialect where im from we actually say numbers like the german way
Like 2 and 40
This is not really used if youre counting from 1-100 but mainly when theres a number in a sentence
I don’t understand our sports really
Skiing is understandable since we live in the north
Then we have chess with the highest rated player ever
Then of all things we have age of empires 2
Not cs:go, not dota, not LoL but aoe2 of all things
We also (sometimes) do this
At least the elder generation
It's so annoying when people at work read parts numbers this way, like "can you find me a one-and-forty three-and-seventy", then my mind sends me in the direction of parts beginning with a 1xxx instead of a 4xxx
It depends entirely
Old people usually say 2&80 when they are talking about 82
Younger people usually say 82
The reasons I have heard we switched to saying 82 is because of telephones
Imagine sitting there and a guy says: my number is 8&80 2&70 9&50 1&30
Saying it as it is is much simpler
The old fashioned way of counting was actually the correct and official one until 1950, when it was decided to change it to what we have today
Yes, it is
We have both north and Southern Sami
But as far as I know, the Sami languages are both spoken and written differently (I might be wrong here, not an expert at all on Sami)
What makes Norwegian different is that we have one spoken and two written languages within the same language
See, usually I can excuse it with the fact that I just don’t understand spoken danish very well (I don’t), but even when written out I cannot tell if you that is a serious number, and what it is, or if you’re just messing around lol
According to Spotify, the most popular non-English speaking song in Norway is the Swedish song “Svag” by Victor Leksell
This song has constantly been (over)played on the radio for months
The most popular Norwegian speaking song is apparently “Vakker og vill” by Rotlaus
Can’t say I’ve ever heard it before tho
I listen to the radio a lot and have never heard it there
Honourable mention, when it comes to Norwegian speaking songs, TIX has had a lot of hits lately
[Vakker og Vill] from Spotify’s [Norway Top 50] list, never heard of the song
I dislike this list though most of the songs there are really bad, but they must be popular since they are on the list
Svag is absolutely everywhere in Norway as well
Komplicerad reminds me of Eiffel 65's Blue
As well as Karpe
They’re guaranteed to hit the charts whenever they release anything
That song has been top 5 since January in Norway as well, im so tired of hearing it all the time
We make often make fun of Bergen, not the region just the city, for having a funny dialect
In Norway its Bergen
What are you talking about
Their language is perfectly understandable
Adana man
After my experience with knowing ppl from all over norway we just bully everyone
Also the way they stereotypically behave
Boisterous, loud and generally obnoxious
And every young person I've met from there conform to the stereotype
And the rain
93 rainy days in a row
200 days of rain per year
Give it back then
Dutch however that's kinda difficult
I'd say the rest of the Netherlands is the weird region in The Netherlands
We'll get the ships then
«What does the fox say» by Ylvis
I am not romanian but this song is, and this is the one song I am truly truly embarassed to enjoy
Just look at those moves
[Sandu Ciorba - Dalibomba]
[Badekaret til Pelle] is simultaneously our worst song and our best song
To me its russemusikk, its kinda like its own genre and its called russemusikk beacuse the russ plays it on their busses
I dont have a direct link but you can probably just search it up
The reason i hate ut is beacuse it is mostly uncreative and just boring
There’s this whole genre that I like to call «afterski music». It’s basically EDM music infused with folksy singing and horrible “rapping” about sex, getting drunk and afterski parties
I guess you can argue the music is made intentionally bad and ironic, but certain people seem to genuinely love it
I can’t stand it
Not sure why it’s a thing
[Here’s an example]
Probably when former glamour model Lene Alexandra released her song "My boobs are ok" [\(Youtube\)]
It's kind of self-deprecating, but still shit
The self-styled Icelandic Frank Sinatra, Geir Ólafs, sings „Santa Claus is coming to town" in Faroese, with terrible pronunciation because it most likely doesn't speak Faroese
[I apologize in advance
David Bowie managed to stay amazing until the end so not all old rockers
I think the latest two albums from Sir Paul are quite good
Some boring songs, but overall pretty good
No coke by Dr Alban is an absolute legend however
I randomly came across this song a long time ago and never thought it was actually popular, even though I have never forgotten about it
Everybody gangsta until the 2002 Chrysler Sebring shows up
Å helvete, is that song from here
It's SO bad, but it pretends to be legit in the same way as Live is Life
I thought Lothepus and Staysman&Lass, and all those afterski/russebuss artists were bad, but they're not really trying to be "real". Franklin tried, and failed miserably
Thats a masterpiece
Ylvis is a legend but that song was inescapable and I still see it from time to time
I agree 100%
I can't see the video as it's blocked
What are some notable people featured there
It sure is
In Scandinavia it's not as common for adults to live with their parents as it is in other parts of Europe
A lot of people go to (free) college/university when they turn 18, so culturally that's generally when people move out
The average age for moving out is 19
3 here in Norway, for example (or at least it was in 2009)
That said, in my experience teens who bring home their partners here in Norway don't face any adverse attitudes in general
I'm sure it varies, but I started having girlfriends stay overnight (and vice versa) when I was 15/16
Never had any problems with my parents or any of my girlfriends' parents
My dad had "the talk" (ie
about using protection) with me at some point when I hit puberty and that was the last we spoke of that
Bringing home a one night stand wasn't exactly common at 16, but I did go home with a couple of girls who lived at home when I was 18/19 (of course we can drink beer at bars at that age) and as you can probably imagine that was always a little awkward in the morning (the parents did serve me breakfast
), but I never had any horrible situations or anything
No separate doors or anything like that
When i was like 12
a girl was coming over to stay the night (there was nothing sexual about it at all)
My mom just told me she didn't want anyone to become pregnant and that was it lol
I was like "ok lol".
I've only lived for a short while in Singapore, and been on a short vacation in Thailand and Malaysia, so I don't know a lot about this, but I guess it's still a pretty common thing in East and Southeast Asia that sex is just a no-conversation topic
In Norway we have the Reindeer Police, who mostly make sure that the hundred year old feuds in the Reindeer herding comunities dont escalate into full fledged wars
The couse behind the conflicts is mainly because there are way more Reindeer than avaliable pasture
It is estimated that about 30—40% of the animals die every year, mainly by starvation
Most of the conflicts on grasing rights and herd size are handled by the courts these days
Finite resources + tradition + money = conflict
There have been some articles in the National media about these court cases lasting decades between families
But nothing that makes the evening news
[I love, love, LOVE it
Edit: It literally makes me cry every time I hear it
(And I'm not even kidding)
I love it, it moves me a bit when I hear it play during the medal ceremony at winter sports
It was written in the 19th century, but only officially adopted as our national anthem late last year
"Ja vi elsker" It sucks
It absolutely fucking sucks ass and i hate it
Too much religious shit, extremely boring, and it's waay worse than the one we had before it
"Sønner av Norge".
I would say 3 on average
Diversity is not the strong point of Norwegian food shops
So you can imagine my surprise when I first visited Estonia and this tiny country had 10-15 different types of fruit juices, 4-5 different brands of milk (Norway had 1 at the time, now we have 3)
It was like entering a different universe
Usually Granny Smith, Pink Lady and one or two others
Maybe two or three other ones if it's fall
Green and red but they are from different brands too
Usually green (Granny Smith) and two different red apples, but sometimes there are yellow apples and sometimes there are three different red, like when the Fuji apples are in season or the Norwegian apples are in season
red, green, yellow and pink lady
Heart-shaped waffle iron (the hearts are formed in a circle)
Norwegian flags to put on your balcony, on the christmas tree and to wave with
Crampons to put under your shoes
DAB-radios (we don't have FM radio here)
Idk
the [hackit] maybe
Idk if other countries has it as it’s quite a local invention from the tiniest place on the west coast
Not sure if EVERY household has it, but its popularity is growing
Cheese slicer, it's not only popular here but we may be the only place where virtually every household has one
A Norwegian flag (duh
The (Norwegian) cheese slicer is not quite exclusive to Norway, it's common in Sweden as well, but I don't think it's used in any other country
Norwegian flags for our [flag pole] our [balcony] our [Christmas tree] On our constitution day you find flags on our [cake] on our [car] on the [baby pram] on our [jacket] and in [everyone's hands] waving them in the parade, or while watching the parade along the road
What a glorious day that is
When I read bowls here, my mind immediately jumped to the same type of bowls
Everyone in Norway older than 45 has them
I literally have that set lmao
They aren't that uncommon here
You forgot ostehøvel :)
Listening to FM radio right now, bro
But you only get the non-mainstream channels
Edit: You don't believe me
Radio Metro
I always assume it's a foreigner if I see anyone under 60 with crampons
Ostehøvel
Cheese slicer
How do other people do their waffles
Squares
Here air fryers are pretty common, but i likd deep fried better
In Norway I find that many households will use a [variera holder] for holding plastic bags
Haven’t been in a single home where that isn’t a thing in this country
This is a thing here too, but usually not in a bag
Sorry to break it to you, but norwegians use this all the time
Its use is splitting ground beef while cooking it in a pan
I have one
It’s really uncommon though, I don’t think I’ve ever seen one anywhere else in Norway
I saw somone else suggest that, and it seemed like it wasn't as uneque as we thought
Analog radio was shut down in 2017 in favor of digital radio
I hear people complain about that, but my excperience is good so far
Crystal clear radio "anywhere" without any scratching sounds
Are they as popular as here though as in like every household has one or is it more of a niche item
Never heard of a Danish cheese slicer if I'm being honest, looked it up though and I don't think I've seen it, definitely not popular here anyway
The rotating ones with the slicing wire
Only seen it once in my whole life, in a Danish hotel
Okay, TIL
I just know that I’ve never seen one in Denmark or Britain
My (Swedish) husband eats a lot of cheese, so we have 5
Not even in old ladies's houses
Fair enough then
I guess it's a popular item in the whole of the Nordics
What is superior really depends on the cheese
You can't cut brown cheese with the Danish stringy thingy
Rumpetroll = tadpole: literal translation: butt-troll
I'm sure the swedes have a lot of Norwegian examples of words that sound childish as well
we have a few,
a gun - skytevåpen (shooting weapon)
a hippo - flodhest (river horse)
rhino - nesehorn (nosehorn)
fridge - kjøleskap (cooling closet)
sloth - dovendyr (sluggish animal)
we also have a thing called a ‘harrytur’ which is when you go across the border to sweden to buy cheap food, tobacco and alcohol
it comes from the upperclass in Oslo who looked down on the worker class, many of whom had been named Harry
it’s basically an adjective now, to be harry
Do you actually call the street crossings zebra crossings, or did my 3rd grade English book lie
Because I think it would qualify for OP's question
Likewise in Norwegian (skytevåpen)
Don't find it that weird though because not all weapons can shoot
Ofc your Danish with that name
My favorite is turbotorsk for shark
"Mus" is slang for vagina here, so it's not a word you'd use if you're afraid of being called a misogynist
> overuse the articles
I see what you did there
The benefits of really dry "school English" mixing with all kinds of more colloquial talk and neither really being learned properly
At least Norwegian and the other Scandinavian languages use "what" like English
Certainly not just you
I like the British, but they have possibly the most obnoxious parliament in the world
Æ pule ja
We have it and eat it too
"Have", but there are other verbs too
/r/JegHarSex
We cultivate it in Iceland too (*stunda kynlíf*, literally 'cultivate gender-life')
Don’t worry, [it was just a stupid play on words]
If using the word _sex_ or _samleie_ (intercourse), we _have_ it, but we have a bunch of standalone verbs that don’t require modal verbs, too
Cultivating is the foreplay, harvesting is the climax
The poppies themselves are seen as just regular flowers which grow in many gardens and other places
The seeds are seen as something that’s put on your bagel for decoration purposes
Nothing to do with opium or opiates, I doubt most people even know the drugs come from poppies
Same here, they have poppy seeds on some baked goods and some old ladies like to have them in their garden because the flowers are nice
I've sometimes joked that they should check the gardens around the villa's in town when I read about a new cannabis grow bust in town
[This is how we consume them]
Not in Norway either as to my knowledge at least
I have actually heard the term "blåfilm" (blue film) for porn, but it's not widely used at all
And then I guess there is "svart humor" (black humour)
Funny thing is that I was taught that in Chinese, pornographic content is sometimes named "yellow films" or something like that
Yeah that's true, especially with svart humor
The death of the norwegian Haakon Haakonson during an overwintering in Orkney
If he hadn't died that year, he is believed to  have accepted the request as high King of Ireland and the separate request as the new Holy Roman Emperor by the pope
This would mean a united Kingdom of Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Scotland, Ireland, and the holy Roman empire, which would have really expanded Nordic culture towards the mainland
The fact that we left the union with Sweden after a rigged referendum in 1905
Both countries would have been better of if we’d still be united imo
Edit: typo
If I changed any of the outcome I might cause a chain reaction that could accidentally delete my own birth and that would also make it impossible for me to go back and change it in the first place or some sht
Basically, by going back and changing an event in the past I will also eliminate my reason to travel back in time in the new future that is formed because the reason to travel back in time has already been taken care of
if you get what I mean
I’m simply not able to imagine changing the past because of this paradox
I also have trouble with time travel movies
(Edit because I think people are taking it the wrong way
I’m not sad, and this is not something I want to do
DO NOT GIVE AWAY JEMTLAND and HERJEDALEN
Cant believe we let that go
No I’m-
I’m fine and I didn’t mean for it to be sad at all actually
I changed the wording a bit so I hope the misunderstanding is gone
I’m not
I didn’t realize I forgot to put "accidentally" in there, but I changed it up a bit now
I'm Norwegian, and when I lived in Australia I found myself bumping into people on the sidewalk all the time
I couldn't immediately see why, but after a couple of weeks I realised it was because I tended to go on the right side while Australians tended to go on the left side
It wasn't super obvious as people still kinda walked wherever, but there was enough of a tendency to make me bump into people daily
It's really funny when you try to walk past someone, but they also try to walk past you do you just end up walking left and right and left and right
Some did like Tordenskjold, some did not
Some are just legends where it’s uncertain whether they existed or not
Yes, that would be a good comparison I believe
Yeah that’s true, I was just thinking of “legends” in general
Tordenskjold was in no way a Viking
No, masks (and antibacterial gel for that matter) are both insanely expensive, which is part of the reason the goverment doesn't want to make masks mandatory
The last mask price I remember seeing is 180 NOK for 10 masks
That is about 16
4 EUR according to a currency calculator I found online
You can get them cheaper online, I think
Yes, but not on masks
As far as I know there is no lack of masks at the moment, so no need to involve any law
But the government is regulating prices on some things to a certain extent
We have very high taxes on cigarettes
Extra taxes on sugary food
Low prices on medicine
High import taxes on food in general (to protect our own food production)
No law on prices of masks, they are actually quite expensive in Norway
But we don't generally use masks (we socially distance instead), so not a huge problem
Only place masks are recommended is on the subway at rush hour
I've seen masks in the store twice, first at the grocery store at the price of about 14€ for 10 masks, and at a pharmacy for 5€ for 5 masks
20€ for 50 masks sounds like a bargain
10 masks for 80kr at rema where i live
If we could have beer prices similar to basically any other european country that would be really nice
I would say "copy not freezing to death from spain", but spain is a tad too hot so I'll copy poland instead
Switzerland seems so practical, also the food is great
I just sant some real French pastries in Norway please
I want longer summers from a more southern country
Don't get me wrong, I still want a proper winter with lots of snow, but I also don't want 6°C and rain in June
Weather and cuisine from Southern Europe, cycling infrastructure from Denmark or the Netherlands in Norway, Finland’s education system and cool old buildings from almost anywhere in Europe
Rich Norwegian here
I agree
You should copy it
Come work her once the pandemic is over
Also, need to say, we arent rich because of the oil
We dont actually spend it
We save it
How do you see our foreign policy
Just out of curiosity
wait I thought taking off your shoes was normal
Think you're looking for the Finnish Education system
That's too true
Especially since we're more corrupt than you:)
I got a very surprised reaction from someone french once when I told them about the high school senior tradition (where you get a lot of dares to do among other things) and this one dare that is to hug a police officer
They were shocked at how easy it is to actually achieve that dare
Police officers will gladly give you a hug if you ask them, even in a drunken state
I never did it myself, but the image of having a police force without such mutual trust is odd to me
Another example: A Norwegian family lived in France for a few years, and the children talked about the differences in the school system
In France you are not close to your teacher, you are supposed to just do what you are told, and discussions in class is a lot less encouraged
In Norway you are on first name with your teacher, class discussions are encouraged, and many students get a close relationship with their teacher
(My son just lost his grade 1-4 teacher (you usually get a new one when starting 5th grade) and there were tears
Even among the parents
Interesting that its so different in France
[This is a fairly typical arrest in Norway] (Subtitles in English)
I think arrogant would be the last word we would use to describe them here
I don't think the difference is that big
But nepotism is still very common
There was a case where an extremely wealthy, actually Norways wealthiest woman was hired as the leader of a state owned company despite having no competence in the field and she was the only person they interviewed for the job
(she's very young and inherited all of the money too, so she probably isn't very experienced either)
So you have heard about that, huh
Is this the part with all the gilliotining and stuff
Nah, the forests do that well enough on their own
We don't exactly lack trees
Most people are more worried about rural areas getting overgrown as small farms have to close
Not sure if it’s our national liquor, but Akevitt, is usually drunken on Christmas, and tastes disgusting in my opinion, but my father enjoys it
Norwegian akevitt is made from potatoes, but from corn in other Scandinavian countries
But it doesn’t taste like potatoes
The flavors depends on what spices you add, and can be e.i coriander, lemon, caraway, dill, vanilla, cardamom and other
[Wikipedia ]
In the north we have Karsk, a drink made of homemade liquor(usually illegal made as anything above 20% is illegal) and old coffee, again disgusting, but will get you drunk real fast and many up north enjoys it
[Wikipedia ]
Edit: added links and more Info
Akevitt, or aquavit - strong liquor based on potatoes
I personally don´t really like it, but I drink it because it is my duty as a Norwegian
I do however love it in cocktails
Aquavit sour is one of my favorite cocktails, which is a whiskey sour where the whiskey is replaced by akevitt
Fantastic
Can confirm the awful taste
So Trøndelag is the north now
When I first tried whisky a few times I wasn't at all into it, until I found the smoky ones
Now I barely touch "normal" whisky and would never buy it
The price stings tho
Koskenkorva Salmiakki pls
Was he lord of the fortress or the Amt
Or perhaps even both
The most correct way to do it is to use 50 øre (0,5 NOK) or any other coin that is made of copper :)
I have only had it in Tromsø and Alta
Sorry about that
Should have described it differently
I'm not really a vodka drinker, but that thing, it's great
No, I never really struggled learning the language, but that might be because I started reading English books relatively early
I also watched English TV and movies from a young age
Speaking english is easy for me, English grammar is something i have to work on though
I was fluent pretty early bc I watched youtube in it's early stages, and we always watched english movies
Not really, English is kinda similar to the Scandinavian languages and I’m Norwegian so it’s not that hard for me
Nope
We learn it in school for a lot of years to the point thay i (Year 10) can say i have reached a middleground in semi-fluency
In Norway, we start very early with learning English in school
I think 3rd grade or something if I'm not wrong, I can't really remember
Personally I really like English and don't really find it difficult
There's a few words here and there that I need to translate, but otherwise I'm finding it easy to understand
Speaking it however is another problem lol, pronouncing the words and sentences out loud when you rarely do speak it is something else
Currently studying at a uni where the classes are in English so I have gotten some practice during that
I'm actually surprised when people who have English as their mother tongue don't know the right way to use their/they're/there, and where/were
I know right
*Omelette au fromage* comes to mind
Recently found out that you spell "jealous" as "jaloux", while we spell it "sjalu", which I thought was a joke at first
Also we spell "chauffeur" as "sjåfør". It seems you have a strong habit of keeping the native spelling of loanwords
He might have said *omelette au fromage* as they sound identical if not said very slowly
Don't think Dexter would have gotten one simple thing like that wrong
That does sound more like du, yeah
Also
it's not like we don't have guns
At least not in the Nordic countries
Few handguns, but lots of guns actually used for hunting
They're used for sport, not defence purposes
> Like, who are these people that feel the need to jump in defence of mega corps that have zero interest in anything besides maximizing profits
In general Americans trust big businesses more than their own government
(Weird I know
but it does explain things
The orange man is >!bad
You say "ugly/childish", I say "at least slightly more orthographically consistent".
> Like, you're six minutes three seconds tall
haha
You mean regulation to prevent outright lunatics from buying guns
Yeah, they're not too happy about that one either, no matter how shockingly obvious it is to half of the US *and* pretty much the entire rest of the world
We were taught "English-English" at school, but it's hard for a school subject to compete with years and years of AmE almost completely dominating the cultural scene with music and movies - pardon me, *films* -  and I think that's pretty much the case all over
Also, non-Brits tend to mostly associate BrE with that "received pronunciation" stuff and general poshness
I know that at least in my case, I'd like to distance myself from AmE but would feel like I'm putting on airs, and trying to mimic a natural dialect would just be worse
And the only vaccines are either hard to implement at a systemic level (make education not suck balls) or illegal
> in Europe, most people don't believe in the concept of races between humans, and just bringing this word up makes you look like a racist
I know
It's about the rudest thing you can do
And reminds me of when a African American friend from the US was visiting my husband and I in Norway, and he was amazed at the fact that no one was afraid of him here, and that people talked about him as "the American", instead of something else
He is even an elderly man in his 60's.
That's a point, and also why I used "slightly" :p
The Americans have a lot of quirks that are annoying, but speaking as a relatively unbiased ESL, I think the AmE spellings usually make more sense
They don't make the orthography *sane* by any stretch of the imagination, but hey
English
¯\\\_(シ)\_/¯
Agreed
The US spellings were a good step in the right direction
What do they call him
"African Brit"?
that's just weird
No one would call a white Brit (or Norwegian, or Dutch or whatever)  'American'..
Unfortunately, it's harder on everyone else
Not a city, but the country Greece in Norwegian is “Hellas”. But for some reason, we switch back for “Greek”, which becomes “Gresk”
København - Copenhagen
København more or less means "Buying port" in about all the scandinavian languages so i have no idea where "Copenhagen" comes from at all
Not a city name, but Greece is "Hellas" in my language (Norwegian)
Most of the big cities (en/no):
Copenhagen/København
Gothenburg/Gøteborg
Vienna/Wien
Cologne/Köln
Florence/Firenze
Bucharest/București (except we don't know how to pronounce the ș, so we just use s)
Prague/Praha
Warsaw/Warszawa
Moscow/Moskva
Belgrade/Beograd
Athens/Athen
etc
Hellas is simply the ancient greek word for Greece, so it works
We also use these names to refer to Finnish cities
be LOG nah
Is Iorua pronounced something like /iːrua/, or ee-roo-ah (I have no idea how to phonetically spell shit for English speakers)
It's not an accent, it's a totally different letter
It makes it look ridiculous to us native speakers
Example: Energy drink "Mønster" which translates to _pattern_, and is in no way like _monster_ (which is the same in Norwegian and English)
It acutally pisses me off whenever I see that braindead logo
OMG
Sikkert
Vet ikke, men det ser ut som "mønster" når jeg leser på boksen
og da blir jeg hissig, haha
I use Gdansk, but for Szczecin and Wroclaw I just use the German names
I have absolutely no idea how to pronounce them in polish
Onion is /nj/ though, while Bologna is /ɲɲ/. Not the same sound to us who have both in the language
Thst helped with Wroclaw(I can't find the /l letter in the keyboard), but I'm still not sure about Szczecin
I'll find something on the internet too listen to
I use [norgeskart] if I want high detailed maps
I use Google maps for the most part but i also use [this Norwegian map site] when i want to look at historical maps
The site offers very old maps that Google dosen't offer
Finn is even more detailed from my experience
Also [Norgeskart] by the Mapping and Cadastre Authority has all the map info you could ever wish for on a more technical level
From property boundaries, archaeological sited, ever house or shed, names of hilltops, earth quality and land use
How come
In norgeskart you even get color gradings of different types of borders and buildings, you get elevation curves, and you can toggle many more settings like information about properties etc
It has much more info than google
Although they are not aiming for the same thing
Google is more for ease of use, while Norgeskart focuses more on proper info about everything
I can’t check right now but doesn’t Norgeskart also have old maps from cities
Sorry, I meant satellite view
English people: Do you say you’re from England, Great Britain or the UK
But What is the country
Or are all three countries
1 NOK = A plastic bag
10 NOK = Cinnamon powder
100 NOK = 1 disposable wet mop
For 1nok, you can get half a caramel
For 10nok, you can get a lolipop
For 100nok, you can get 4 litres of milk
Aren't the bags 2 NOK now
Or perhaps it varies from store to store
I need to know where you shopped
Bought plastic bag 2kr and cinnamon (67g) 20kr at REMA yesterday
I'm being ripped off it seems
I love these examples
Can you even get plastic bags for 1 NOK anymore
The cheapest I see these days is 2 NOK
Two beers
That’s outrageous
4 cinnamon buns are like 70 NOK
And they don't even taste good
We are one of the most expensive countries in Europe so Ukraine would be a good break for us
Norway is an expensive country
It was REMA's prices I used
There's a cheaper cinnamon made by TORO aswell there
I have seen 2kr plastic bags but I usually see 1kr more
I'm lucky
So cheap tho
Here you would get one standard 0
4 beer for about 90 NOK
It was changed to Gøy - fun
G er for gode og gøyale gutter, Ø er for ønskedrøm, Y er for yppete og yppe alle jyplinger ut i det store hav
G is for good and fun boys, Ø is for wishful thinking and Y is for provoke trouble and chase all weaklings out to sea
The song;
He probably is
He never got that recipie after all
We began by learning printed-like letters, but we quickly switched over to cursive after
Didn't learn anything but capital letters and then cursive at my school
Can't really write print-like to this day
Cursive, but I transitioned to printed-like before middle school
My handwriting too horrible to write in cursive
You literally won’t be able to read it
Besides, I practically don’t write as a part of education or work anymore
I learned both in school
I remember cursive being a pain in the ass
My writing has ended up as a sort of hybrid, now though
we learn both
we learn print-letters first and then we have special books simply to learn cursive
the only reason we learn cursive though is to give is a legible hand writing
We learn both, and end up being confused and write like 6 year olds
> First in printed-like letters, then cursive
Same here
Source: I have children in primary school
Probably the one that charges tourists NOK 285 a head just so they can say they've been to the North Cape
Charging people exorbitant amounts for bottled water
Paying the sticker prices
Also, an hour long «fjord cruise» in a RHIB in Skjolden cost 600kr per person
All you do is drive along the same route the cruise ship sails just to see a waterfall, but you have to enjoy the view from sea level instead of the sun deck on the ship
For 800kr they let you off to walk up to the waterfall and wait for your return
Experienced a strange version of the rose thing when I walked past some palace or other in Wien
There was a small square in front of a door, I walked along one edge and on the other side, at least ten meters away some woman with roses suddenly stretched out her arm and held out one
Did she really think that would make anyone rush over and toss money at her
Same in Norway
Some taxi companies are overpriced, but not outright scams
Some restaurants are tourist oriented, but in general are OK-ish overpriced food
Beggars are our main thing to look out for too, especially the Romani ones
They pickpocket a lot
It sound weird enough to be interesting
In reality, I think it's a little - what's the english word for food that's kind of stretchy and tough, the opposite of tender
I ordered a seafood mix at a restaurant in Greece 2 years ago
The octopus tasted good but but i didn't like texture
It felt like i was chewing plastic
Im not a big fan of seafood to begin with, so I would pass
I've had octopus sushi in Japan, was alright
Not something I think I'd ever add into my regular diet though
But certainly didn't freak out about it, we eat a lot of weird seafood to begin with
Definitively strange
I'd put it in the same category as snails
Then again, the only seafood I eat is fish
Won't touch shrimp, they remind me of wasps
I just now realized that we don't differenciate between squid and octopuses in Norway
The english wikipage on octopus doesn't even have a norwegian version
> galician style octopus
Tapas must-have
Yummm
Nice, thanks
Our next biggest city, Bergen
The delightful scottish custom of alfresco fridge burning
The only thing I prefer about the US is that most public restroom have paper seat covers but here if I need to drop a deuce in public I have to make a nest of toilet paper
So no, I think I’ll stay where I am
I feel safe here
I feel safe most places in Europe
Absoutely not
It would be a downgrade for me in virtually every way possible
Less safe, more corrupt, fewer worker's right, worse press freedom, worse choices when voting, worse healthcare system, plus I just prefer Norwegian culture, language and way of life
I don't like the superficial, more materialistic way of life in the USA, where people think bragging is a virtue
No thanks
I was an exchange student there for 10 months
That was enough
Short term
Yes
Long term
Americans work themselves to death, and unions don't the same power
My life is not to be dictated by some owner who I will never meet
Yeah sure, if it wasn’t for the healthcare and the freedom to roam we have here
But otherwise I would; preferably on the east coast
I like the US, and I hope to visit my family there sometime
I notice this subreddit often is very anti-American
It’s okay to have an opinion about the US and criticizing some things without having a constant superiority complex about yourselves
A lot of Europeans think Americans have a superiority complex; I think it’s the opposite
Interested in visiting it, yes
Interested in living there for more than two weeks; hell no
We would have been fucked royally as Norwegians moving to the states
I'm on sickleave for depression and anxiety, and i would have been living on the streets at this point
Especially the candy, KitKat should be illegal dont @ me
Exactly
It was my glib way of answering the question in the negative; no, I would not want to live in the USA
I agree so we could reconquer Jamtland and that other part as well
To be fair, KitKat is originally British, and the Brits have decent sweets from what I've heard
But I know what you mean
KvikkLunsj forever
Say it in norwegian too, but that is probably no surprise
Still says alot about cultural differences thoe, lol
We do it in Norway too
Wow, looks like I’ve got next weekend’s entertainment all sorted
Thanks, Amazon UK
You use English terminology in the Netherlands
Duly noted
Duly noted indeed
Do I need to leave them sitting out for a while in the sun, or is that going a little too far
Asking for a friend
Yes, I've noticed this
Isn't that a shame though that you don't come up with your own definitions and words, but borrow from English
How does this work with older people not being fluent in English, do they need to have certain words in public documents translated to them
I don't think it's seen as too private
I've heard my mum's birthing stories multiple times, as well as other people's.
I'm afraid my mom starts talking about it whenever mine or my sister's birthday rolls around and we're home
My family, not so much
My colleagues, all the time, and I'm a dude
Even worse
They’ll gladly share details about their sex life, their partners and how they perform in bed for each and everyone they want
Soon everyone in your village/town/city/company/school knows how you do
Taking a drink with a girl friend (friend) at a bar
She’ll confess her sex life in details, long record of it over decades, to me (a guy)
I’m just not interested, neither of being gifted any knowledge of this or being exposed myself
What the fuck is wrong with you
Just stop this practice
Now
Just stop
It's different from family to family
I've heard a lot from my mother in law and her kids, but nobody from my own family really gave any details until I was pregnant myself and then they told EVERYTHING, as usual
Depends on the family
The christian part of my distant family wouldn't dream of talking about birth or sex or anything of the sort with their children
Probably kebab
Oslo has a shitton of kebab places everywhere
> roast dinner
As comfort food
Your boyfriend/girlfriend just broke up with you, and the next thing you do is make a roast dinner
> Probably if you were devastated you'd visit your mum for it though rather than make it yourself
Good point
Norwegian has a tradition of calling countries by their native name
Czechia is Tsjekkia, Greece is Hellas, Italy's Italia and Austria (Österreich) is Østerrike
France is however Frankrike, Finland is Finland (not Suomi)
Also, names of Asian countries tend to be the same as other western countries use instead of their native names
Japan instead of Nihon, Kina instead of Zhongguo etc
Edit: Forgot to mention that Hungary and Croatia are Ungarn and Kroatia respectively
There are no country which are completely different from the English wording in our language
Most countries names are translations from their English equivalent
The only country where two different names could be said are The Netherlands with Holland as the other designation
But, using that today would be all wrong considering the Netherlands are more than just Holland
&#x200B;
Edit: As below pointed out, Greece = Hellas, for us
Totally forgot about that one
Germany - Tyskland
Switzerland - Sveits
Hungary - Ungarn
Czech Republic - Tsjekkia
Belarus - Hviterussland (White Russia)
Austria - Østerrike (quite literally the same as in German)
Norway= Norge/Noreg (It's practically always pronounced Norge, but it's written Noreg in Nynorsk, a secondary form of written Norwegian)
Sweden=Sverige
Russia= Russland
Greece= Hellas (Grekenland is sometimes said by old people)
Switzerland= Sveits
Hungary= Ungarn
Austra= Austerrike/Østerrike
Germany - Tyskland
Hungary - Ungarn
Greece - hellas
Greece = Hellas
Austria = Østerrike
Germany = Tyskland
Russia = Russland
Belarus = hviterussland
there are probably a lot more but these are the ones i remember at the moment
Some more, not all are native names - some are "Norwegianified":
* Belarus - Hviterussland ("White Russia")
* Estonia - Estland
* Sweden - Sverige
* Lithuania - Litauen
* Lebanon - Libanon
* Morocco - Marokko
* Chad - Tsjad
* Switzerland - Sveits
* Canada - Kanada
Well, Germany and Tyskland come fron different roots, don't they
But Tyskland from the same as Deutschland
Edit: And also Greece - Hellas
Only country outside of Hellas to call Hellas Hellas and all that
Even though most words are some translation of some sorts, they still might look different so people from other countries might be confused at first (I have frequently been confused by the English names, mostly when I was younger but sometimes my brain forgets)
Some country names that look different than the English name:
Belarus - Hviterussland (means white Russia, but I think I learned that russia isn’t an exact translation of rus
Austria - Østerrike (just like Österreich)
Hungary - Ungarn
Czechia- Tsjekkia
Switzerland- Sveits
Germany - Tyskland (Tysk mean German, so it’s basically Norwegian for Deutschland)
I also feel like we don’t really say UK, we use Great Britain - Storbritannia
Thailand
That stems from a spelling reform from the early 1930s, where traditional German/Danish influenced names were replaced with something closer to the native ones
It used to be "Grekenland" from German "Griechenland" through Danish "Grækenland". Also, "Rom" and "Lissabon" became "Roma" and "Lisboa". It was not very consistent, however: They didn't replace Ungarn and Finland with Magyarorszag or Suomi, for instance, and in the case of your country the capital is called Athen instead of Athinai, the language is called "gresk" and the demonym is "greker".
Its basically same
We say Montenegro, what do you say yourselves
Sverige is the Swedish word for Sweden
That's not norwegianified at all
Kanada with a K is [wrong
White Russia is another name for Belarus in English and Russian as well
Elfenbenkysten for us, which is a litteral translation of Ivory Coast (Elfenben - Kysten)
And for some reason, governmental institutions (most notably NRK and Språkrådet) insists on calling Finland (the country itself as well as towns and cities) by their Swedish names, not Finnish
NRK News will say Helsingfors and Esbo instead of Helsinki and Espoo for instance
That's like pissing the Finns in the face imo
I agree
I always use the Finnish names both at work (I teach geography) and in everyday life
Same with barbers and hairdressers here, for some reason
They seem to prefer English puns though, like Hair Today, Cutting Edge, and Pubic Enemy No
1^(\*)
^(\* Ok, I made that last one up)
Not exactly known for bad puns on their shops, but in Norway any alcoholic beverage that has more than 5% alcohol is sold through a state-owned store called Vinmonopolet, The Wine Monopoly in English
In Longyearbyen one of the worlds most northern "cities", the store is called Nordpolet, a play on the Norwegian word for the north pole: Nordpolen
Pretty much exactly the same in Norway, and almost all of them have some grammatical error in their name
You're apparently not a proper hair salon unless your name is a bad pun with poor grammar
There are a lot of Norwegian puns as well
På Håret
Fruktbar (restaurant)
Kos Dykk (dykkesenter i nynorskland)
Glade Hjul (budbilfirma)
I can only think of "Hair and there"
The most famous one in Norway is probably "du må ikke sove", which translates to "dare not to sleep".
The poem written in 1936 is about the Nazism and Fascism's onward march in Europe; a warning against indifference, human contempt and a warning against what would happen
I can think of two
One is [Heimskringla] by Icelandic poet Snorre Sturlason
It is allegedly about the first kings of Norway, with a bit of mythology mixed in
Some of the stories are short and centered in Norway, while others, like the story of [Sigurd Jorsalfar] (The Crusader King) is action packed and follows the characters fighting Arabian pirates in Palestine
A bit more modern is [Peer Gynt] by Henrik Ibsen
It is a play centered around the titular character, where he first travels around the beautiful Norwegian countryside, lies his way through every situation, and travels all around the world and then dies
Smarter people than me can probably go in-depth on it but it is considered nationalistic romance at its finest (even if Ibsen didn’t necessarily think of it as such himself)
I think I'd go with Terje Vigen for us
Do domesticated or wild animals wander around residental areas where you live
Some news local to me: [Reindeer wander around residental area] (in Norwegian) knocking on doors with their heads and eating flowers from people's gardens
Like most reindeer in our country, these are not wild, but semidomesticated and left to wander around by themselves most of the time
I imagine similar might happen in other Nordic countries, but I'm curious to know if this is a common occurrence elsewhere
Do deer gnaw on plants next to your house, to take an example, or do foxes lurk nearby hoping to find food
I grew up in a residental area out in a small rural town
The houses bordered a big forest area and while you rarely saw animals going up to houses they were very close by
They found wolves feces a few hundred meters from my house one time
And moose wander around aswell
I often see roe deer in my garden and the streets in all seasons, and I live pretty deep in the city
I live a bit outside of Oslo so it's common to see deers in people's gardens and I always have to look out for moose when I'm driving
I'd rather drive of the road and possibly crash in a tree or a ditch than one of those big fuckers
We had a fallow deer just outside the house once so that was nice
But normally it's smaller animals
When I grew up we had a lot of sheep breaking into our garden
There was one particular sheep that learned how to jump fences
So it was always able to get to the delicious grass (and flowers
) there
(Later came the rule that all sheep in that area need to be fenced in
I live in the South, and moose and deers are definitely common here
They eat everything in the gardens so people don’t really like having them around
But I like looking at them and find them beautiful
Except from wild birds, the neighbourhood cats and the occasional squirrel, very seldom
I saw a deer some years ago running through the neighbours garden and down to ours and into our road, it had come down the hill where I live
It used to be normal to see a moose or a deer when our neighbourhood was surrounded by more forest, meadows and fields, but after it became built down the animals disappeared as well
I live in Norway too and it’s very common to see reindeers and moose outside the window, I live close to a lot of acres where you you most often see them
And one time a whole moose family were right outside the door
And recently I have heard that an Eurasian Lynx has been wondering close to the neigbourhood, though I haven’t seen it myself
The rarest animal I have seen close to the house was some sort of lizard I don’t know the excact name of it
I have meese eating my fucking apples every year and it's pissing me off
We also have foxes, badgers and what seems like an invasion force of deer in my area
Last winter I almost shat myself when I aimed my head lamp at the field next to the road I was walking on at night and saw what must have been 20ish pairs of eyes staring back at me
I'm strongly against it
In winter and in Qatar with the deaths of underpaid and mistreated workers
It's a hard fight between FIFA and the IOC for that top spot
Could just watch a pirated stream
Well it is
Doesn't mean it tastes bad, but it's certainly not as "exciting" and flavorful as more southern cuisine
I guess they haven't tried our fish dishes
Some of them can be called nasty, or vomit-inducing, or crimes against humanity, but not boring
Where i live in the south the meal on Christmas Evening is boiled cod with boiled potatoes
(I'm not kidding)
I'm from the west myself so I prefer dried (and then watered down) sheep meat with potatoes and mashed swede
My (South African) husband still can't understand why anyone would choose this meal for the "main meal" of the year
Obviously it came from a time when salting and/or drying was the only way to preserve meat and fish
(And my Norwegian self thinks is delicious
We got fish, cold fish, warm fish, fresh fish, dry fish, fried fish, and lutefisk
I think the ocean has is a big part of it
I mean, in scandinavia it's mostly fish and potatoes
I don't know anything about Germany or Poland so I guess southern food is nore exiting
France and Italy have all this super fancy food
Fish is still very nice tho
Because that's 100% how it is
And when it isn't, you wish it were
My hypothesis is that countries further south had much easier access to spices and things like that, and quite probably a much larger range of things that would grow
Because they are
I am genuinely courius, what is so bad about the norwegian cuisine
Different variations of meat/fish and potatos is so good, thats like all I eat
> I view Norway as the darkest pit of culinary doom
Thanks
The best food I ever ate travelling around Europe was in Belgium
(Yes, better than the food in Italy and France)
What
Don't u LOOOVEE fish and bland potatoes
Nah for real our cuisine is *chefs kiss*
I feel the need here to take a stand for Norwegian food
I'm not saying we're on par with France or Italy, but we're honestly not worse than Denmark or Sweden
I think you haven't tried a lot of traditional Norwegian food, and that's not strange because it's not easily accessible for tourists, as restaurants rarely serve it
It's stuff that's made at home on sundays
Yeah we do have meat and potato with brown sauce, but so do about everywhere else in the northern hemisphere
We really do have some unique traditional food with exotic taste
Pinnekjøtt
Fårikål. Rakfisk
Lutefisk
Smalahove
Acquired tastes for the connoisseur
Well reindeer tastes really nice
For (Northern) Norway, salmon of all kinds, my favourites are creamy salmon soup and smoked salmon, also fried pollock, fishballs, reindeer stew/roast/jerky, and ptarmigan/elk after the hunting season
It's not all bad
I mean it's in our culture because it has been that way for centuries
The light meals in Norway have traditionally been either re-heated porridge or a flatbread (soft or hard) with stuff on (mostly sour milk cheese or other milk product)
We've had less than 100 years to "catch up".
Most fancy/foreign Scandinavian restaurants aren't very representative to the normal cuisine though
They tend to get rather creative with their recipes and choice of produce from what I've experienced
Fårikål - Sheep, cabbage and black pepper
> Well historically, it's also not true
Dunno about Finland but Medieval English food definitely made use of loads of imported spices
The reason British food has a bad rap is cos of rationing in the war
The older generations basically forgot how to cook any of it
Medieval *upper/middle class* British food
The average peasant wouldn't have access to them I reckon
At least not here in Scandinavia
The average person would hardly visit a market as they would often be a day or more away, living mostly off grain and milk from the farm
Maybe some ginger or such for special occasions, as has been known since the 17th century here
Some local herbs and spices were used though
Only among older people
(My grandmothers favorite)
Isn't water a spice
It makes a fart smell, in at least two different ways you can interpret that sentence
Thanks
That means a lot coming from a continental
People drive for 2 hours to buy cheap bacon and alchohol in Sweden
Well, Guinness could almost be considered bread, no
Gamey I guess
I grew up on that stuff so I love it
I think you need to get into the old mentality of saving it all up for nice food on a Sunday
When you get 50% of your calories from barley, and 40% from milk products, there are only so many things you can do with them
And believe me, we have tried all the different things you can possibly do with those ingredients
Food on normal days wasn't supposed to be anything special
Just fill you
Sundays had better food
Usually meat, which wasn't common in the week
As well as vegetables and such
With a side of preserved berries for sweetness and maybe even some butter
People would get really into it for holidays
For example my region has a boiled meat dish with ginger and nutmeg for a party (wedding, funeral, etc
) dish
And people get really specific about the various details and methods
If you're from north or south of the onion belt for example, or you serve it wrong
Or other foods we deemed important, like ale, the fancy bread, or christmas food
Yeah they deserve credit for that, but it's still not really representative I feel
The techniques and dishes themselves are quite important
I could go to Canada and have native Cree people serve me food from more or less the same ingredients found here, but I doubt it would be similar
The secret ingredient is snot running from your nose, your face so numb you cannot feel your chins and a Finnish social realism series of your choice on full volume in the room next to the dinning room
I don’t think that’s true
Potatoes and bread are very important in Nordic cuisine
Yeah, but I just mean that it's not exactly that representative
Most Britons never had that spiced food I can imagine
So it's weird to argue that "*Medieval English food definitely made use of loads of imported spices
*" as you say
If it is anything like Scandinavia at least
We have preserved medieval northern European cook books written in Old Danish and such, popular in towns
But towns were just a tiny minority of people back then most Norwegians never had the spiced food with cloves and cinnamon described from there
Since we're analyzing, I think I have three; makes farts smellier, makes a fart-like smell, and it "makes" a fart smell (like "manners make the man")
At least in our language
[Here they talk about the electricity cables connecting Norway to "the continent"] We are connected through Russia, but I guess we never felt very connected to Russia as a country
So that might be the reason we feel disconnected land wise to the rest of Europe
Haha
Come to think of it, I have no idea whatsoever what you eat in the Netherlands
What is common traditional food there
(Meat/fish and potatoes as well
Norway, Finland, Sweden, probably Russia too
I'm not saying it's bad or anything
Just that's it's not a very good base to form your opinion on nordic food on as it's kind of its own thing
And I mean even if Russia had been in schengen it would still be easier to cross by boat, bridge or plane than to go all the way there
Yes
Three is more like if you're an absolute fart aficionado and think that, without the cabbage aroma, any fart smell lacks just a little something
You are living on islands, so that makes sense
We are physically connected to the European continent, but in our minds we are not, kind of thing
Since to go to Europe we need to cross the sea, as no one would travel to Europe through Russia
So we see Europe as something "down there"..
> Boerenkool
Looks really nice
I get what kool means (it's kål in Norwegian), but what does "boeren" mean
It makes even more sense for us I think
England is closer to most of continental Europe compared to Norway and Sweden
Sweet Caesar Two Regime
Got it
I have never heard that before
We've always just said Romerrike  / Roman empire
Ahh okay, TIL
Yeah, but it’s failing miserable and I hate it
Just let me use my English technical terms and phrases
Am in ICT, so my view may be *slightly* biased
Yes
Hashtag is "emneknagg". They apparently don't understand that they can't make longer words and expect people to use them and they are like half a year to late
We do
Språkrådet
Some of what they do is just stupid, like spelling bacon as beiken or service as sørvis
Some of what they propose is used though
I saw a guy here use nettbrett instead of tablet as an example
Nettleser (webreader) instead of browser
Skjermbilde instead of screenshot
Norway does have a long history of regulating the language
Sometimes successfully, sometimes not
The most terrible failure was in the 50’s when they wanted to regulate how we count
Norway used the German method of counting
We said tre-og-tyve (three-and-twenty), which was replaced with tjuetre (twenty-three)
70 years later, both methods are in use, and people will say shit like «tjuesyv» (27, with the old word for seven) instead of «tjuesju» or «fem-og-tjue», which is 25 with the modern names for the numbers but in the old-fashioned word order
We so got språkrådet (language council) but
they're not really that good at their job
In that they often will replace established English words with Norwegian ones that are just stupid sounding
Like Halloween to gresskar kveld (pumpkn night/eve), hacker to datasnok (computer sneak
I am so using "kropskondom" from now on instead of sovepose
Related to this, to my Norwegian ears, it always catches me off guard that Danes use the word teenager and weekend
It sounds so unnatural to me, where we have tenåring (very literal translation but it works very well) and helg (never actually looked up where it comes from, but I think it has to do with the same word for saint
Edit  I was sort of right, "helg" comes from old norse "helgr" and is the same as "hellig" (holy)
So "helligdag" and "helg" etymologically means the same
Group sex in Swedish is gruppsnusk according to Norwegian jokes
46 minutes ago I was called an idiot for writing 'advice' instead of 'advise'. So I guess that is my answer
I'm fluent enough that I don't really mix up words in general, though there are some spellings I still struggle with
One that I still struggle with though, is to vs
too
I usually get it right, but I have to stop in my tracks from time to time
And it took me a LONG time to get into my head that "its" is used when talking of posession of something, like "the elephant found its stick" and not "the elephant found it's stick", since usually ownership is indicated with the 's, but not here (the your vs
you're stuff though, piece of cake)
I very recently was told that when people say "he yelled at me" it doesn't actually mean yell
It means like "scolding" or something, though I was told scolding is what one does to a child, so yell can mean both scream and harshly talk to somebody
In my native tongue, there is a distinction between yelling and that other yelling
So this bothers me because I don't feel "yell" is the right word to me lol
I also still have slight problems with that "jump" both means to jump, but also get frightened
So I struggle more with words that I usually have two words for (and that are very different things) but in English has one
It's actually fun though when it's the opposite, which is quite often the case
Like English is smart enough to have the word "teach" and "learn", while we just have "lære" (though you can add a word like "bort" - away, to mean "teach")
Or lots of other little words describing emotions and stuff
Yeah, he is probably American or Australian or something
Sadly, there is a rule saying, there are no rules without exceptions
Some people say that rule is itselfs' only exception
And then they get all smug about it
Obviously a difficult word to translate litterally, as it naturally will never be words necessarily meaning the exactly same things in other languages
Oir literal patron saint is a guy they dug up from his grave only to find his hair and toenails had grown
He was therefore believed to be holy while in reality this happens to every corpse
Dude you need a France flair
For English speakers: Chuck of Gaulle
One of the local rich guys just spent 1,5 million euros trying to spread knowledge about "the science of intelligent design"
There are no scientists claiming the earth is flat
And I have not seen any doctors or scientists suggesting that everyone should stop vaccinate their children
But there are in fact some [real scientists] saying human activity have little influence climate change compared to other factors
But no, none of them are really a thing here
Never heard of any Norwegian believing the earth is flat
Extremely few opt out of vaccinating their children
And most political policies promote limiting CO2 emissions
Antivax and flat earth are very small movements here thankfully
A not so small minority are climate change deniers
What is "mainstream" are alternative medicine and beliefs (homeopathy, chiropractic work, acupuncture, etc) (biodynamic wines, Steiner schools, believing in "spirits")
Came here to say the same thing
Well the outcome is that a foundation working to promote creationism got more money to spread their message
How many will buy into the bullshit in the long run is of course unknown
Definetly
The fact that the russians liberated the northern lands without occupying them is a huge boost to the norwegian opinion of russia
Not that I'm aware of
Interesting
When the Soviet Union attacked Finland in 1939, it made virtually every Norwegian dislike them
During the war however, they became allies, and they liberated Eastern Finnmark
This made them very popular in Norway after Nazi Germany capitulated
(Source (in Norwegian):
Not forgiven, but we've moved past it
It wasn't the German people per se, but one party lead by a crazy dictator
We understand that the German people are in fact not nazis, and are nice and well-mannered people as a whole
I mostly browse pictures of cats, so no
Yes, its probably one of the reasons i can't stand top level comment from Americans about America here
Like let me have this place without you adding to it the thing i already see all over
I do not mind them doing this as child comment to a top post however
It feels more like a conversation then and not that guy that always talk about themselves talk about about themselves again
I single out the US as it permeate reddit vs any other country so you get your fair share of them all over the site
Now I don't hate the US users on Reddit, I wouldn't be here if i did
Sometimes it just gets a bit much and i need respite from y'all
To draw a European equivalent, back in my early internet days you would be the Germans coming to the English site you hung out on then refused to speak anything but German until some admin made a German corner they could hang out in
For real though, why you do this Germans
I wouldn’t say isolated, but I feel like it’s skewed in a weird way
I think I rather see American culture as special – not isolated of course as a whole lot of it is exported, but they care about a lot of things that no one else in the world cares about, especially sports
Not the best of examples, but a lot of Americans find it interesting and relevant to go ‘hurr durr let’s talk about Minnesota Vikings in this post about historical findings about actual vikings’.
No one except Americans care one inch about their team’s song or existence for that matter, but as they’re disproportionately represented here (Europe has more than double their population) that’s probably what you end up having to scroll through anyway
Edit: To add to all this, I have a much bigger bone to pick with ‘[pet] cuteness’ culture, which I guess overlaps but isn’t uniquely American
It’s that thing where people think pets doing X and Y is _exclusively_ cute and how dare you point out that human body language could possibly be a less than optimal way to interpret their behavior
Or when people go ‘I do this with my pet all the time so your *general* advice is wrong’. Somehow I feel that being super anecdotal like this likely means you’re an American
‘Don’t you come here with your pesky facts about pet health, you’re ruining all the fun
For cats
r/cats, /r/kittens, /r/FromKittenToCat are good starters
Especially the kitten one
Kittens are the best
Also r/mildlystartledcats is pretty cute
Took me a while to rewire my brain to accept it as ‘the last place they’ll call home’.
Except Kardashians, I dunno if there is a subreddit for them, but knowing reddit, and americans, there probably is
Same
This smartass, throwaway comment has really helped complete my subscription list
r/catdimension satisfies my cats *and* shrooms
Well, almost
How did I not even know this was a thing
This is wonderful, thank you so much
I love this
Someone else recommended this earlier and I checked it out to make sure it was SFW
It's not just SFW, it's also adorable
And for added chuckles, I'm a gay guy
I expected a raised eyebrow or two when I tell people I'm checkin' out tight pussy at work
I love cats
I love cats *so much*. I go out of my way to pet a cat that I see walking down the street, I talk to cats, I even idly think about cats
Other than my family and close friends, I think cats are probably my favourite things in the world
I'm baffled by how so many people love dogs, I don't like them at all
But before I say anything, I have to stop and think, „hey, ormr_inn_langi, you *reeeeally* love cats, so maybe shut the fuck up
All I ever want to do in life is roll around on a big, fucking lawn with a happy cat
Not at all
I'm just using different words that happen to be in another language
The idea/thought behind the words is the same regardless of language
Garbage truck driver
Mortican is perhaps the word you’re looking for
They also get paid extra for working in close proximity to bad smell and
garbage
It's honestly not all that bad once you get used to the smell
I worked as a garbage man for a week one summer and all days except one was quite bearable
The advantage we have in Norway is that there is often a bit of wind
Which helps I would imagine
Oslo: Rich, expensive, international, socially divided
Bergen: Rain, loud, slightly obnoxious people, nature, fjords
Trondheim: Students, moonshine, leather vests, mustaches, Rosenborg
Stavanger: Oil, stuck-up people, oil, pulpit rock, fjords, oil
Drammen: Norway's largest intersection, trying desperately to be something more than Norway's largest intersection (and succeeding
Kristiansand: Religion and heroin
Tromsø: Northern lights, cold, dark winters, bright summers, "Paris of the north"
Bodø: Windy as fuck, shit weather, fish
Ålesund: Beautiful, boring as fuck, very beautiful though, mountains, fjords
Trondheim: Stupid People
Bergen: Stupid People, rain
Anywhere in the north: Angry Stupid People
Even further north: Sames
Oslo: Spoiled Stupid People
This is how Norwegians look at other Norwegians
Bergen: Rain and a funny dialect
Can you do Sochi and Murmansk as well
I'd add "rain" to Bergen, or shit weather in general
Also maybe Rosenborg to Trondheim, biggest football club in Norway, It's certainly an important part to the city's identity and something I think it's well known for
Alao, Birmingham: Black Sabbath
Good point
Added both
Here is an awesome YT video from a linguist about your topic
Same thing happened with the Langobards in Italy: they basically adopted the Vulgar Latin spoken by their subjects over time, [but some Germanic vocabulary took hold]
> Younger people think it's shameful I think
No need to feel ashamed
I feel absolutely no shame at all for all the killing and looting the Vikings did
Youre being generous with us, frænd
Cant call iceland and some islands in the north sea an empire ;(
It's more recent yes, but as the years go by it will continuously move further into the past
Ah, yes
Christmas trees does wonders
But you are right, sending Pakistan a Christmas tree might not have the same effect
True, but no one sitting in government today had anything to do with it
Anything with a “sen” “ssen” ending could be Denmark, Norway, sometimes Netherlands
Add a Magnus, Ivan, Søren, etc
I think double first names are more common in the north
Names ending with -sen like andersen or johnsen, they're probably from Norway
I guess because of norse tradition of like "son of". If its -son it could ble sweden or even iceland
Lol funny that you think those names sounds like they are out of a fairy tale
They just sound like very dull names for middle aged men to me
And in my experience, it's most common to have a short name first and then a longer one, like Bjørn Tore
However, not in Sunnmøre, there it's the opposite, like Tore Bjørn
Edit: I should clarify that Tore is longer than Bjørn because of the number of syllables
Norwegians typically use -sen like Danes
If someone in Norway is called -son, I usually assume they're Swedish or have Swedish heritage
That's just in Sweden afaik
In some areas in Norway (mostly the west), -son -søn and -sønn endings used to be more common, and none of them used the double s.
Yeah, many people seem to think we use -son, probably because of the old viking names
But then after the viking age, we were under Denmark for over 400 years and adapted your naming traditions, so -sen names are now the standard in Norway
This is our top ten surnames:
Hansen
Johansen
Olsen
Larsen
Andersen
Pedersen
Nilsen
Kristiansen
Jensen
Karlsen
\+ a bunch more -sen names and farm names
The first -son name is Andersson at around 170th place
We do at least in Norway
I know some people with the son ending, but they are not nearly as common as sen
I would guess we probably stopped using the son ending sometime under Danish rule
I'm half Australian, half Norwegian, grew up TCK (France, UK, Sweden, Thailand)
Moved back to Norway at 25 after living abroad most of my life, spent my teens in Australia
Miss Australia and feel like I don't always fit in here, but I went to Australia for a visit a few years ago and didn't fit in there anymore either
I dont know what my future plans are, but with two kids and a husband I'm likely to stay put
I do dream of going back to Australia though, I miss the Sunshine, the culture, friends and food
But truth is its too expensive, my kids won't hace the same quality of life as here in Norway, and home ownership seems like a pipe dream over there
responsible thing is to stay
Here's hoping I win eurolotto
> Czechoslovakia
Thank goodness - it's impossible to spell
Where did you live in the 20 years prior to moving to Spain
I'm impressed with the fact that you left the UK after so many years
How is business in Spain
> Brexit broke our hearts because we had a great life there
Because of the effect it would have on your business
Or something else
I have always lived outside the EU (Norway), so I can't really relate I guess
> Children
We wanted them to have the opportunity to live and work in the EU
Ah ok
Anyone can apply for a job in the EU though, whether you are a citizen of the EU, or the US, or India
But its obviously a bit easier living in the EU
> But Norwegians still enjoy FoM, no
Yes
My South African husband tried for a few years talking me into moving to the UK (way before Brexit was a thing)
He never succeeded, so we are still in Norway
"Mi taco tiene pinta de vagina podrida" in Spanish (from the dark web in GTA V)
"Je suis blessé, je ne peux pas bouger"
"I’m injured, I can’t move" in french
I just learned these by hearing them, and can't spell them
French: kø sjø pø avec de banan
Vietnamese: Quack o má!
Russian: Jåp tvåjo måtj blatj
Ya nye shchi, ya ogromnaya utka
(Apologies for lack of Cyrillic letters
(I no longer have any idea why I learned this
Jeg er en pølse means I am a sausage
It means «my taco looks so tasty
», just google it :) (or not)
Yes, I think that's it
It's supposed to mean *can I pay with bananas
Definitely Norwegian, and probably Danish also
Ahah i know, unfortunately
Thanks
It's a very handy phrase indeed
I intend to use it the next time I visit your beautiful country
Whenever that may be
We have tickets to Nice this summer, but it's not looking good at the moment
Christmas traditions/ markets/ food/ decorations/ tv-programs in general
Love it, can't wait honestly
Also love summer holidays, beaches, the warmth and barbeques too I guess
Our [national anthem
] Makes me cry every single time I hear it
And I am not even exaggerating
The movie "Flåklypa Grand Prix". Its an animated puppet movie made by Ivo Caprino
And the best movie ever made
There is a trailer on Youtube
If i knew how to link it here i would
Yeah you are right
Im a little slow but think I finally figured it out
Flåklypa is still a great movie, just the fanvase is so so
The only one i know is a crafting channel
Nerdforge :) they make cool things
We have gotten 0 points four times, so take your pick for the worst one, lol
Personally I nominate [this one] from 1997
[Mil etter mil] also got 0 points, but it's kinda legendary here in Norway
Jahn Teigen (RIP) was a Eurovision/MGP legend here
[Here] are all of Norway's entries so far for those interested
Bonus fun fact: We've come last 11 times (in the final), lol
Tooji - Stay (2012)
this for sure (in my opinion)
My Heart is Yours by Didrik Solli-Tangen
Me and my family are still pissed because we didn't send Bjørn Johan Muri with Yes Man to Eurovision that year
It's been 11 years
Who was that guy who represented you a few times around 2000-2010
I think he had long colorful hair dyed different each time
I loved watching when he was on
He was a nice break from all the others
This one from 2012
[Tooji - Stay]
It got last place and is by far the worst one in my personal opinion
Don't get why Teigen didn't get more points, that man was a legend
> Personally I nominate this one from 1997
Oh, that one was awful
How the hell did it win in the first place
oof i agree
I didn't need to be reminded why I gave up on caring about our "representative". Thanks
I find Tor Endresen much worse than Tooji, the late 90s early 00s was a bad time for us in Eurovision, lol
I completely forgot Tooji was a thing
I suppose that says something
I have ptsd i also hated haba haba
I have absolutely no idea
It's Tor Endresen
Sorry, my bad
It was Ich Troye from Poland
Maybe I'm wrong, or maybe he never got to the final
I'm looking through finalists from several countries now, man
there's so much weirdness
My favorite from that period is 1999, but that's only for the nostalgia as it's the first Eurovison song I can remember hearing as a child
Oh yes, like I said - I like it purely for the nostalgia
He was awful live
Stig Van Eijk
So nostalgic
Not saying he was good live to begin with, but he actually did have an earpiece problem in the Eurovision final
He was clearly much better in the Norwegian final
Oh, intreresting
I was like 6 years old at the time, so I just have fond memories of the Chicago Bulls shirt and black marks on his face with the very catchy song
Yep me too lol
I was 8-9 years old and remember he was gutted right after the performance because he couldn’t hear himself
This is not a thing i Norway
We were at neutral country in WW1
We were neutral which I assume is why we have no special traditions regarding it
I always call it Czechia, both in Norwegian and English
Plus, it sounds natural, like all other countries that ends with ‘ia’.
I also think it’s kinda weird to call a geographic region by its governmental form, so I just call it Czechia
Same way I don’t call Norway the Kingdom of Norway
It's not a shortening, it's the name of the country
The government may use a more pompous formal name, but the proper name is still Czechia
Does it really or are you just not used to it
The present Norwegian flag is just so pretty
We shared a flag with the morons to the East, and we called it Sildesalaten (the herring salad)
But in 1905 we grew up and made our own nation with our own flag
When you can buy a case of beer for around 100kr, that makes you happy indefinitely
[The medieval flag] of Norway which, not really a "national flag," was used by the king and used on ships and military fortresses in the 13th and 14th centuries
It’s still used today as royal standard of Norway and is flying on the roof of the royal palace in Oslo
Your flag is awesome
I just can't shake the feeling that it lacks something
I'd like to see children drawing this
Yeah, the raven banner is my choice even if it's not a proper national flag
That's their sole intention when designing something like that and legalizing weed
I respectfully disagree
The bright red is what makes our flag so lively and almost cheerful
You guys' flag could well be darker, but the bright blue is cute, too
Just like you are as a people
We use *sjalusi* (just a Norwegian spelling of the French word) and *misunnelse* (which literally means to begrudge someone something)
We get them mixed up too
We often use "jealousy" about romantic jealousy, and "envy" can even be a compliment, e.g. I envy you your hair (a thing a woman can say to another)
Brødrefolk unity
Yes, like most countries (exceptions I know about are Russia, Poland, USA), there are large dialectal variations in Norway
For much of the country you can easily hear what village someone is from if you're familier with the area
Words for "I" include jeg, jæ, je, e, eg, æ, æg, ej and i.
Lots of dialects
And some of them are rather hard to understand
Im not shure, acording to online sorces it have never been counted
But seeing that the dialekt differ from one city to another, example Arendal - Grimstad - Lillesand ( ca 15 - 30 min travel with car between each) they think we have as many dialekts as places
It would be Intresting if someone did count them though
I had an Internship In Wangen im Allgäu.. That was an experience Haha
> North Estonian dialects are actually genealogically closer to Finnish than they are to South Estonian dialects
TIL
Damn, there are parts of Listerländska that sound exactly like some dialects in the Sunnmøre region in Norway
The first few words that came out of that old mans mouth is exactly how my grandfather spoke
The first part, where the old man answers with "Jau, det var det
" is like exactly the same, especially the "Jau", as i would write it more like "Jaøu" in Norwegian
&#x200B;
Interesting stuff
For its size the variations are very small, aren't they
Accents yes, but not dialects as far as I know
At least no well known and widespread dialectal differences throughout the country
So basically very small changes (in comparison to many other countries)in a very huge country, not large dialectal differences like here
Here you drive for twenty minutes and meet people that use different words than you
For example this means the same:
Æ veit itj
Eg vetsje
Jæ væt itte
Now Im curios about Australia though
How is it there
Pretty much agree
I would add: Oslo also has Finance, Govenment and Media
Jæren has agriculture
It is called Pfizer/Biontech, but if shortened it is called Pfizer
But I not think it is considered to be an American vaccine, it is quite well known that it was developed in Europe
I honestly haven't been paying any attention to that
It may be about taking credit even if it doesn't work
Norwegian, Sami, Icelandic, Faroese, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portugese, Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, Russian, Polish, Croatian, Greek
English, Swedish, Danish and Spanish
Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Italian, Spanish, english, German, Frensh I think thats all, so only 8, I have forgot the others I guess
I probobly knew more when I was younger, but those are long forgotten
Norwegianswedishdanish, German, English, French, Italian, Spanish
Probably Dutch, if I remember correctly I read Dank U on the McDonalds trash can in the 1990's.
After learning it in Danish and Swedish, I don't suppose it was to hard to learn the Norwegian word for it
Pretty much the same word, "tak" in Danish and "takk" in Norwegian
The Danish spelling would in Norwegian indicate a long vowel sound, but they both have short vowels
"Tak" in Norwegian means "roof" though
You can add Norwegian and Swedish, too
It's the same as Danish, just tiny variations in pronunciation that foreigners might never get just right anyway
If you say "tack
" everyone will smile and say "værsågod", " varsågod" or "kamelåså".
Obligatory "Happy cake day
" reply
If the response would be limited to how they address actual school shootings, I don't think it's anything to be overly worried about

I got this brilliant idea: you take two boards of wood, strap them to your feet and go out in the snow and glide forward on them, possibly downhill as well
I don’t know if this has been tried before
Dødsing
Diving, but you fall belly first and correct it into a streamlined dive as late as possible
We already did this
It's called the Winter Olympics
Ok, so I know this will sound a little crazy
But
What if we add jumps to that
Uh , our northernes would give you a good fight there
People from the south would just enjoy the show, but people from the far North
I was at a party with a bunch of them once, and my ears were ringing for days after
We don’t need to add any sports
We are already dominating in almost every form of sport with skis on the feet
Oh yeah, I did think about that, sounds a bit wild, but okay
Do you think the neighbours will fall for it
When LIDL was around in Norway, they introduced the whole reload your cart and bring it over to another counter thing, but I guess people thought it was too much of a hassle and went to a different shop instead
After 6 months or so they introduced standard, Norwegian tills where you pack your bags at the end
Norwegians are among the people in Europe who shop for groceries most often
Most people I know shop every day on their way home from work
I guess having to learn a new system while being stressed out and wanting go pick up the kids isn’t an optimal situation
My bet is that the same thing happened in Sweden
I don't think Denmark will play a big role, cus you know is like a pancake down there
But maybe Sweden would try to compare
Anyways I was wondering what you were gonna call this sport
Both
Gear optional
Neither Denmark or Sweden will stand a chance, that’s exactly why I came up with this group of sports, for the Kingdom of Norway to be superior in a Olympic
I think we could call it something like winter games or snow planking, something like that
No, but it was unfimiliar
Norwegians buy sausages in vacuum sealed plastic, not jam jars
Lidl came to Norway before the local supermarkets had startet introducing their own low-cost brands, so Norwegians had to buy branded products
Now all supermarkets have their own lines of products
I guess LIDL came to Norway ren years too soon
And also, the Norwegian stores were trash
The Lidls I’ve been to abroad have been a lot better than those that were in Norway
True, true
And snow planking seems pretty solid, man
Didn't REMA 1000 buy out all Lidl stores
Yep, but apparently that contract had a clause that Lidl can buy out all of Rema if they want to
There are a few
The "no to road tolls party" has been mentioned
A couple of comedians started Det Politiske Parti, "The Political Party" in 2000
According to [wikipedia] one of their slogans were "the elderly are in a way also people, and should be treated as such". They didn't have any opinions about anything and wanted people to send texts with opinions during debates
Most of their debates were boycotted by other parties
They got almost 20 000 votes the year they ran, but that wasn't enough to get in
There was also Vigrid
Right-wing-Norse-mythology-neo-nazi-party
It was run by Tore Tvedt, who lived in a caravan
The party was popular to use as a subject in school projects, as Tore Tvedt answered to every email from every student, usually the same day and in incredible detail
Pirat partiet : Meaning pirate party, their main goal is to make pirate copying movies and songs and series etc legal
So basically to remove copyright
I sensed Vermin Supreme before I even finished reading the comment
Well, it's a democracy
I've signed petitions like that without actually voting for the party
I wouldn't sign for neonazis though
Maybe us
We're not stupidly big in land area, 6th largest in Europe but I believe our geography and how the land is "distributed" if that makes sense makes us feel much larger than what we actually are
For instance, we're only slightly larger than Germany but much more difficult to get around in and we have far greater distances, due to us being essensially one long stretch of land and Germany being more of one united mass
This is probably more for Europe though, in a world context we probably still don't count as big
Argentina (2
78m km^2) or Indonesia (1
90m km^2) I think
Indonesia is sometimes mentioned as a big country, but I've never heard anyone say it about Argentina, yet, it's massive at more than 1/3 of Australia's size
Yes, exactly like you described them
Must be Oslo, it’s the only proper city we got after all
It’s the city that can offer the most of them all in this country: good restaurants, great bars, some fun clubs, world class coffee and cafes, cultural venues including one of the best opera houses in the world and exciting galleries, exciting new architecture, leafy streets with beautiful houses from the 1800s, elegant squares with fountains, it’s the most European place in Norway, it has got life and a magnificent location between the fjord and the spruce clad hills, not to mention the charm of the trams
Poznań is a cute town but it very small and boring compared to Wrocław, which is very vibrant and has a lot to offer
This is weird coming from a Norwegian I guess, but I lived in Wrocław on my exchange and visited Poznań. Loved Krakow as well, never been to Warsaw but I heard from a lot of people that it is quite drab
I love Oslo for all of your reasons
It's just big enough that you can discover new places a do new stuff all the time, and it's usually visited by the world's biggest artists
But it's also small enough to get around on a bike
The vast forest with lots of gravel roads and lakes is usually no more than 15 minutes away
I am also secretly in love with Bergen
It's got its very own vibe with old historical buildings, different architecture and very different people from the Oslo people
I would actually have to agree
I think Oslo is a bit underrated among Norwegians, especially non-easterners who like to hate on it
What I like about it is the size and that it feels like a proper city
I was kinda suprised after having lived in Trondheim for over a year now of how small it feels like
The city centre is where everything happens here and you can walk across it in 15 minutes
Oslo has that anonymity feel which I kinda like, in addition to pretty good public transit which I also appreciate
100% agree
Oslo is the only proper city (though Bergen comes close)
And tourists usually don't come here to see a European city, they usually come to see the nature
What's so good about Oslo is the size relative to the proximity of nature
You don't have to travel far to be in the middle of a forest
Not much of a fjord lol
Lots of places has a North
I dont think most tourists are going to the forests of Oslo when they say theyre going to see Norwegian nature
Very true, I was a bit quick there
It was
The peak of Norwegian humour is just saying English memes in Norwegian
While reading through the comments I can't remember a single meme I've ever seen in Norwegian
Although I'm sure they exist
Any other specific subs/groups you would recommend
Trying to learn french and need some dank learning resources
Ich habe eine einene Nervenzusammenbruch
J'ai apprendu en peu
Or something
But I am listening to the innerfrench/cottongue podcast now
I like the idea of just jumping into trying to understand stuff rather than focusing on grammar og "beginner" material
I subscribe to Nordic memes
Filters
How do you do that
No, I have no filter in place and I have experienced no issues with that
This, and adding/removing subreddits as interests come and go, especially remove subreddits if they go full retard, which some of them sometimes do
I don't think I've ever even visited /r/all
[Falstad fangeleir] it's a prison from when the nazis occupied Norway during WWII
I was a typical bratty teenager, but when we entered the showers I had shivers down my spine
It wasn't a single day, but my class went on a camping trip for a week to a place called Stryn when i was 12
It was unusual hot that september and we slept in the woods under the stars almost every night
We did alot that week like fishing, Kajakking, trips to nearby mountains and grilled hamurgers and such
Good memories
we went rafting down a river and everyone at one point fell of their rafts and got pulled under the water
also, some idiots decided to make a makeshift flamethrower inside the boys lavvo
which is not very smart
Not single-day if we count the journey; but when my school from Norway went to the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland
I went there as well
Made a big impression
I just read a bit about the camp, I remember visiting the forest nearby and a memorial there
I couldn't recall being told that the gestapo murdered 200 prisoners in the forest and put them in unmarked graves
damn
If I remember correctly: 5th or 7th grade from the school nurse, and in 10th grade from our teacher
At my children's school a nurse does it during secondary school in 7th grade
But they also have some in 5th grade done by the teacher
But my children asked where children come from before they talked about it in class, so I had given them the basics already
we usually have people from the local health clinic come in for one or two classes to educate along with the school nurse
other than that we learn a bit of the biology early by just the regular science teacher
We have a science show on TV (Well, not really science anymore) called Newton
In like, 2016 or something, they started with a segment called the Puberty series
A warning was showed before it started
It was borderline porn
The host would touch people's dicks and pussies and explain stuff
Pretty fucking weird and I turned the TV off immediatly when it came on
9th grade from the nurse for me
In 5th grade at the school I went to, the nurse would co-lecture with our regular science (naturfag
) teacher
I take it wasn't the same for you
We saw this cartoon about how babies were made in 4th grade, then we learned about sex, stds, and condoms in 9th
No, only the nurse
I remember falling asleep over the table at a Vietnamese restaurant in Prague while I was interrailing
In Norway we call it «Kalkun», it comes from German and is a shortened version of Calicut hen
Which is a city in India
Norwegian-German here
Born and raised in Norway and lived here all my life, but been to Germany 10ish times by now
I have living family there that I keep in touch with often and I relate to a lot of their culture
I do speak German but I also understand way more than I speak it
So I do identify as 'both' but I like to make it clear that I am mostly Norwegian and the German side is just the extra
Norwegian/Icelandic:
I don't consider myself Icelandic, because I don't speak the language that well, and I have only lived there for less than a year
This question makes me wish I had payed more attention in history class
That would be Nice
We were thought that the British get offended if you say toilet instead of restroom
I have later discovered that this not true and most the people I know say "I'm gonna have a piss" or something similar
I remember learning in German class that male cousin is "Vetter" and female cousin is "Kusine" (probably because those words are so similar to the Norwegian "fetter" and "kusine")
It took me years of experience outside of school until I realised that these words were outdated/not used at all and that Germans instead use Cousin/Cousine
I remember being told that nobody uses "hi" in English, and that I should use "hello". I know it doesn't answer your question properly, but I'm feeling rebellious
"horses eat hey"
Lol I've never heard of that,  we call it banan
Also, if it were a Norwegian word it would have been spelled gulebøy. Now I might actually start using that
Yeah, I assume so :)
Yeah, since I hear Kusine in German, it took me a while to notice the other spelling
Do I remember correctly when I’m thinking you pronounce Cousin with a French accent though
Like an “ah”-ish ending instead of “-in”?
Like roboglobe said, gulebøj wouldn't even be the right way to spell it even if we did use the word (which we don't)
Minnepenn is more common than minnepinne, but both are used
What's wrong with agurk
Ahh, this explains it
Finally
I'll send a letter to my school and make them change it
Change the school to a toilet
Interesting, thanks for the info
It's always fun to learn little nuances like that while learning a language
I mean, I don't know about the school you went to, but mine could definitely use an upgrade in many areas, especially the toilet department
Thanks for the info
I really like Norwegian place names
I like that you can very easily trace lots of the names back to the old Norse meanings
And then there is a lot weird names like Hønefoss - Hen/chicken waterfall, or Nykirke - new church
Nykirkes church was new 400 years ago
Basically same in Norwegian
I looked it up, and the original name in old Danish was Køpmannæhafn, which should mean something like merchants harbor
(before that it was just called Hafnæ - Harbor
If I'm not mistaken, I think Tolkien used Celtic as basis when making the languages
I might not recall correctly though, so take it with a grain of salt
technically its north finmark with 1
5 people per kilometers
But to me its the  Hardangervidda, in the middle of norway
Its right betwin oslo and bergen but almost no people live there
Just old cabins, mountains and lakes
Gokk
Litterally, "gokk" is something people say when they're talking about middle of nowhere
depends, there are several types of ‘middle of nowhere’.
we have jan mayen, or peter Ists island which is pretty isolated from literally any humans
we have exetremly desolate areas in finnmark and the plateaus where you won’t find anyone for miles, but you’re still in norway proper
and then there the middle of nowhere, where people actually live
like inland østfold or inland rogaland
basically anywhere not on the coast
Tbh most of the country could be considered "middle-of-nowhere"
Pft, Norway's middle of nowhere is obviously Nord-Odal
The correct answer for Norway is "everywhere that isn't Oslo".
Come on guys
It’s totally Bouvet Island
It’s literally the most isolated island on the entire earth
Every part of norway that isn’t a city is middle of nowhere
I would say the central part of Trøndelag outside of Trondheim, or Gudbrandsdalen
But Finnmark is also a perfect example
These places are literally so old and empty omg
Also called "Gokk", like where I live
basically anywhere not on the coast
and the smattering of wierd territories we have such as jan mayen and peter 1sts island
We have a lot of places like that or worse
You're now banned from Bergen
> I would say the central part of Trøndelag outside of Trondheim, or Gudbrandsdalen
There's tons of towns and more or less continuus farmland and inhalation there though
Middle of Østerdalen is way more desolate
Lampedusa is pretty isolated I guess
Closer to Africa than Italy
yoo you're from Gokk
me too, neat
Let us not forget Bouvet Island
Very common, and not only that but most people choose to go south aswell
Northern Norway is loosing its population and only a few places (mainly the cities Bodø and Tromsø) are actually growing, the rest is slowly dying out
It says it all when Northern Norway in general has only about 2k new inhabitants each year
Definitely not the other way around
well, at least for young people
Young people flock to the cities after growing up in their small home town
I am one of them
What you mentioned is a pretty similar situation in Norway aswell
The older people are mixed
Some stay in the cities, but most stay in small towns, especially in the north (north of Oslo) because it's more quiet, less stress, etc
Not only Northern Norway, but more rural places all over the country lose particularly its younger population to the cities and especially Oslo
My husband and I want to move to his small hometown, but there aren't any jobs for us there
so we're staying near Oslo for now
It kinda sucks tbh
It's sad to see places lose population
Thats a wonderful trend
"Don't enter the train tracks"
Should be commen sense, but you know: some people are dumb (or rather do dumb things)
It makes me think back to the time I traveld to japan, one day the train was late due to a train suicide in akihabara/ or another part of tokyo, dont remember where we was
Ann the automatic english voice said "train delay, cleaning remains". So train tracks and signs related to it sounds more menancing to me now
Probably [this]
The text means "Warning goes for the whole Svalbard archipelago". You cannot go outside the town without having a person in the group with a gun
Jøss
Det var ekstremt
Burde nesten stenge det området, da :o
So true
But sadly its commen in japan, no one reacted at all
It dos makes you realize how dangerous trains can be though
Thats intresting, but what about fences
A problem here is that they dont fix the fences often enough
I used to live next to train tracks and there was alot of holes in the fences, bent open
Ser ikke ut som det står det nei, men det sier seg vel selv
Norwegian: personskade
> and there was alot of holes in the fences, bent open
But who are these people making holes in fences around train tracks
It's a mystery
Its wierd, its not like they use old trains you can hitch hike with anymore
I dont think there is any sort of organized rugby here
Dont even know how the game works
I had never heard about until a rugby ball had gotten thrown in my face at gym
Too bad the Belgian/Dutch spring season of cycling was stopped this season
You guys have the best races of the season
Wtf is grid iron
Both milk and eggs go in the fridge
That seems to be the most common way of doing things in Norway
You store fresh milk in room temperature in France
Yeah milk goes in the fridge, if not it'll turn sour in a day or so
Cold milk is the best
With eggs I think it kind of depends on the household, was housesitting for someone that had their own chickens and they just let the plucked eggs stay out on the counter in a bowl or something
For me though, I put it in the fridge as soon as I get home from the store
Yep, especially since they're both in the fridge at the store
Not in Norway
Unless you buy of a farm/local egg, eggs are always in the fridge
This is the first time I've heard of UHT milk
We don't do UHT milk here, it's some sort of temperature processing of the milk and makes it shelf stable in room temperature and can last for months
The process definitely has an impact on taste, but it's ok for cooking, baking or to put in coffee/tea
My french mother in-law always keeps some UHT milk in the cupboard in case she runs out of normal milk
[UHT is around] , I’ve just never seen anyone buy it
I’ve never looked for it
I remember that we had it in school for cooking, but kolonial
no is a normal online supermarket, so it is being sold to consumers
I bet Tine is the only company that makes it, and as my little political statement I never buy Tine products
For that stuff, yeah
Normal milk is 14-18 depending on the store
Like I said, I’ve never seen anyone buy it
I’m guessing it’s an expensive process for a product in very low demand
Here’s our normal stuff:
Now this is some time ago, I was on vacation as a teenager to the Canary islands
I ordered a T-Bone steak and could only get halfway through it, It was delicious so i was trying to eat more and took breaks until the waiter noticed this and asked me if I wanted to take the rest with me
Up until that point i had only heard of this in American media, i think i recall the fantasy-scene in Dumb&Dumber when Jim Careys character gets into a fight with the Maitre d' and puts his heart in a "Doggie bag".
People usually don’t ask, but I have never had any issue the times I do
Some restaurants even encourage it, so they don’t have to throw leftovers away
You can often ask for a paper bag and the restaurant will give it to you, however I don't think people do it that often
I've never seen it done here
I have seen it done in the US, but it seems to make more sense there as pretty much anything you order will sustain you for 2 days
Depending on the restaurant, it would probably be seen as a bit tacky here
You go out to eat at a nice restaurant and have a fun evening
Food is just part of it
A restaurant is way more than just a place to buy food
I have asked to take home leftovers when I've been to family restaurants with my kids
That's not a problem
But I would never even dream of taking with me leftovers when dining out with friends
That's just not something you do
Besides, what am I to do with it
Bring it along for the rest of the evening
Place it next to me in the bar
Take it to bed when I get home
I get it that staff ask you when portion sizes are huge, but I never really understood how this is supposed to work if you A) don't drive to the restaurant yourself and go home directly and B) regard a restaurant as nothing more than a place to buy food
It's mostly the same in Norway
However, it varies from home to home how common it is to leave food
All my grandparents were young during WW2 and my parents always had to eat up because: "You're lucky you have food
" My parents were a little less strict with us, but throwing away food you have paid a lot for was never an option
Eat it up or we bring it home
Same in Norway
Norway hasn't got a culture of eating out, its more common now but was quite rare for families to dine out
So with my limited experience in restaurants I never saw anyone take any food home
Usually they just say they're done and the waiter takes it away
I agree that it is wasteful
All through my upbringing i was told to think of the poor children in Africa when I didn't finish my plate
Its quite common for my generation to be brought up that it's a shame to not finish the food on your plate
QWERTY, with Æ, Ø and Å to accommodate the Norwegian language
I have a Norwegian keyboard, which uses QWERTY  but also includes letters such as å ø æ and has some things shifted around
For example, there is a whole second line of icons with the numbers, and things are shifted from the keyboards I grew up using in the US
@, for example, is underneath the 2 instead of above a different number
[Image of layout]
It annoys me that Denmark went for JKLÆØ, while Norway has JKLØÆ and sweden has JKLÖÄ. We all agree on the placement for the Å letter
Due to this difference, and keyboards being made for the Nordic countries usually has a common layout, the Ø and Æ button has three different symbols
Yeah I have white letters, green letters and red letters
For some reason I am using the white letters which are the Swedish ones - but when I type it comes out as the Norwegian ones
But yeah - they could have at least made one Nordic version
That's a good question
Honestly I never even noticed there was an €-symbol on the E-key until now
I've had my computer for 6 years
1, 5, 6 are the only numbers to only have "shift + key". The other have both shift and alt gr
I just use USD, GBP, or EUR when I'm referring to currencies anyways
Yup
The Danish have those two switched around in the alphabet order
You guys made me laugh
Thanks
Did this guy finally find something Scandinavia doesn’t top out in
They do this in the Netherlands
(Where do you come from
I would definitely say its because of the price
Its the same here in Norway, you bring alcohol for yourself and taking someone else's is seen as stealing
A lot of the times people will share, sure but with young students especially, people bring enough for themselves and cant really afford to share
I really felt this cultural difference when living in Poland
Buying a bottle of liquor or more beer than you need was no big deal so sharing it didn't really end up in a big loss and vice versa
It was nice, I miss it
That would be odd here in Norway too
People use curtains that let the light in, but blocks the view
But then again Norwegians in general are quite private people
it’s the same here, you only drink what you bring
or if you manage to convince someone to either buy for you or sell to you
Same here in Norway
So probably a weird Scandinavian thing
I would say its because of the price, yeah
You guys can get beer for 25 cent, if we had that relative price for alcohol im sure it would be different
Over here it usually takes maximum 30 days to throw someone out of a house
Covid-19 made no difference to that
(Norway)
Isn't there a percentage, though
X percent of the parts must be made and assembled in Switzerland
Interesting
That was new for me
Thank you
Walla snuppa, kom inn i Mujaffas BMW

Maybe a little, it is connected to skin cancer
Very deep tans were in fashion in the 80s, the trend is more moderate now
I thought you asked if us northerners saw tanned southerners as un-healthy
Was a bit confused there for a moment
(We view southerners in general as more healthy
Mediterranean cousin and all that
Not using your own dialect is looked down upon in Norway
Context doesn't matter, you should never ever change how you speak
In Norway your dialect is a very important part of your identity
Not keeping your dialect is somewhat like denying your roots
Due to the geographical boundaries the different dialects have all developed in their own distinct way
In my area, anyone is able to tell in which of the 4 neighbouring towns a person resides in, simply by the variations of their dialect
As a kid, I often found it difficult to understand my grandparents as they came from a different part of the country
Therefore by changing your dialect can be pretty hard and it doesn’t sound natural
No dialects are seen as lower class or uneducated, but there are a couple of stereotypes:
Toten-dialect: farmers (they have a lot of potato farms)
Nordlending: fisherman
Finnmarking: reindeer herder
Sørlending: religious
Trønder: moonshine brewer / skier / moose hunter
Gudbrandsdøl: knows norwegian fairytales and folklore by memory
Setesdal: WHAT EVEN IS THAT LANGUAGE
ELVISH
Here in Norway everyone is proud of their accent, and it’s shameful to loose your accent
people almost go as far as calling people who lost their accent as traitors, kinda ridicolus
In Norwegian, we have a word for trying to speak another dialect or language in an unnatural manner (i.e. unsuccessfully): *knote* ([ If I would try to adapt to the dialect where I live now, it would immediately be noticeable, and it would sound weird
Therefore it is much better to just stick to the dialect you grew up with and that you speak best
On the other hand, some people adapt unconciously, speaking a mix of dialects, especially if living in another place for a long time
This also sounds weird, but strangely you notice right away that this is the case and it is accepted (although trying to keep your dialect is much better), as opposed to conciously trying to speak another dialect
Nah, sørlending is danish
No one touches that willingly with a ten feet pole except on the weekend we call summer;)
My grandma is still bitter over me changing my dialect when we moved to the north when  I was 10
Great times
I've lived in Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger, Haugesund and Ålesund and never once heard someone not speaking their dialect
The only exception is immigrants not from Oslo, now living in Oslo, trying to speak with an Oslo accent
Not one that you would switch to
The King speaks a rather posh Oslo west dialect
Politicians speak the dialect of where they're from
The royal family have also grown up in the West end and Asker, so it's not like it's forced either
It's very close to how normal people speak there
Not really imo, he speaks as a 85 year old guy from the Non-worker areas of Oslo
Off course it’s going to sound posh when it’s an old dialect
The older neighbors I had(dead or moved) here in Bærum spoke like him even if they had grown up in lillestrøm or Holmenkollen
Yes, definitely
Well, non-working areas and west is often two sides of the same coin
I'm surprised about Lillestrøm, though
And no the only dialect change I really notice in Oslo is between the East and west in the city, the areas around Oslo and even Lillehammer has a very close dialect to the standard Oslo
Lillehammer is actually quite funny since the areas between them and Oslo has kept its dialect
Yeah, today it's kind of an urban-rural divide, at least in the east
Not weird
You just read a book or scroll through Facebook while eating
Not that I know of
A lot of business travelers eat alone
I don't care what other people think of me
I like to go alone sometimes
The same with the movie theater
Depends on the restaurant
Going to a fancy restaurant with a fancy name that serves fancy food, that's a little strange
McDonalds alone is ok
I think you're on point there
I would only ever eat out alone if I was travelling with work and they paid, but I wasn't with anyone else from work
And yes, talking restaurants here, not mcdonalds or similar places
A meal plus a beer or a glass of wine at a restaurant would cost about 40€, which is a couple of hours work for most people here
No, it's just another thing that 'Murica should've left back in the 19th century
Its outlawed and Will count as murder or stealing
To be fair, US police also have little to no education
To become a police officer in Louisiana, you have to take a 360 hour course
Divide that up in 8 hour days and you're looking at less than two months of training
You can't even call yourself a barber with that little training
Here in Norway you have to get a bachelor's degree in police science
But I think also the police in US have very little education, sometimes as little as a few weeks
Depending on state
And my axe
Fårikål. A super simple but very delicious dish with mutton, cabbage and black pepper:
Rakfisk, fermented trout
Admittedly an acquired taste, but if you can overcome the odd smell, it tastes almost like an expensive cheese
It's unique and delicious
Something for the connoisseurs:
Pinnekjøtt, dried and sometimes smoked lamb ribs
Served with mashed rutabaga:
I wish instead of reading comments I could look at photos
And let us not forget the regional speciality [pølse i vaffel]
Personally i was going to suggest the Norwegian Kjøttkaker(Meatcakes)
It's like Swedish meatballs but proportional to testicle sizes of Norwegians as opposed to Swedes
You forgot Smalahove, literally a [sheep's head on a platter] Not that you really see people eating it every other day
I agree with your list but I would like to include the family of "potetball". Raspeballar, klubb, komle, småball, fiskeball
And it keeps going
Churned potatoes, flour, salt and water, sometimes filled with meat
My grandmother told me that when she was a budeie on the støl they made ball filled with whatever they found, like pebbles and screws and made it into some kind of weird lottery
I prefer my balls to be filled with mår.
The lamb ribs are a traditional Christmas dish, so it's only really possible to get hold of here in December
But it's a real treat
The rutabaga/swede/turnip mash is also great and goes well with many dishes
Most people have some carrots in it here too, plus cream
I like to add some sweet potato
A nice trick is to put some of the fat from the ribs in it, makes it real rich
When it comes to the trout, well some people really like it, while many people find it a bit repulsive
I think you need a bit of an open mind to enjoy it
If you're ever given the chance to try it, don't be a chicken
You'll be missing out on something entirely unique and different
Norway has eight sites on UNESCO’s World Heritage List
And that made me realize I’ve only seen two of them, so now I got some ideas for next summer
Bryggen (1979)
Urnes Stave Church (1980)
Røros Mining Town (1980)
Rock Art of Alta (1985)
Vegaøyan – The Vega Archipelago (2004)
Struve Geodetic Arc (2005)
West Norwegian Fjords – Geirangerfjord and
Nærøyfjord (2005)
Rjukan–Notodden Industrial Heritage Site (2015)
Kind of expected Nidarosdomen to be on the list, but I guess it's not really that significant among the thousands of churches in the rest of Europe
I have not seen a single one of these and to be honest, I do not even know what some of them are
I have never heard of the Vega Archipelago or the Geodetic Arc
So jup, I got some traveling to do next summer too
Må dra dit når korona roer seg
There's always a discussion about what Christmas food is better
Ribbe vs Pinnekjøtt
I'm a ribbe person myself, but I live in a pinnekjøtt area
Its mostly what to eat for christmas and there is a lot of other stuff but sadly i dont dont remember gem now
I vote to put onion in
Just got to say, Queens jam (a mix of raspberry and blueberry) is the real hidden secret of Swedish cousine
That is a combo I had not tasted or even heard of up to a few years ago
I had an a-ha moment first time i tasted it
It tastes fantastic
Why isn't that a regular jam in the whole world
It is so delicious
Where I live many people eat boiled cod for Christmas dinner
And I know - it makes absolutely no sense
I prefer Pinnekjøtt
Or the related julebrus-war
(I personally drink neither
And then there are the heretics that eat lutefisk
I will never understand the concept of Juletorsk
Wtf
Or perhaps even worse - Lutefisk
They're crazy
In my family we gather together with a whole lot of extended family and eat juletorsk 1st or 2nd christmas day (depending on what fits the best)
I love the dish, but not for christmas eve
The people I know eating fish for Christmas say it makes room for lots of dessert and cakes later in the evening
My parents are from different parts of the country, so I grew up having both pinnekjøtt and ribbe on Christmas Eve
We have had lots of different things on Christmas Day/2nd day, but never juletorsk
My mom loves lutefisk though
We do the same
The best thing about having juletorsk on the 1st or 2nd is that you can add pinnekjøtt-broth to it
A mix between the Norwegian and English word for Norway/Norge - Norgay
Norge because that’s what we call it and I find non native speakers trying to pronounce it entertaining
I often find myself saying Deutsch when im talking english
It just comes naturally
We call you Hellas, if that's any consolation
TIL: Hrvatska
We can call you 'Full' from now on
In Norwegian you are Ungarn
Would that do
We spell is Tsjekkia
We already call you Estland
And I agree, it has a nice sound to it
How bout 'Kypros'?
Why though
Even in mostly Nynorsk areas, Norge is the most common name in use
We call it Estland
They speak Netherite
> and they speak ‘Netherlands’.
Nederlandish
Unfortunately they still speak Gresk
(Maybe we should start calling it Hellansk
The "iy" combination would be redundant in English
Also, they can't pronounce the final "e".
De er full
Both should have emphasis
nOrEg
But I disagree that Norway should change in English, as the English version is closer to the original meaning of the word than the Norwegian equivalent(s) are in Norwegian
Ie "the way north".
It's what we do in Norwegian
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Nothern Ireland is Det Forente Kongerike Storbritannia og Nord-Irland and the short version is just Storbritannia
It’s the same in Norwegian: øster - east, rike - kingdom/empire
Try typing in "Noreg" here
Type in the more common word for Norway "Norge". That has a clear emphasis on the first vowel
But perhaps you're right that there's more emphasis on the first vowel also in "Noreg".
To be fair "Leif" is a pretty normal name in Norway, even though it's not a very popular one now
I just said it out loud with Danish pronunciation
No, it doesn't work very well in Danish
[Does this count
I do not
I own a single t-shirt with a Pingo print, otherwise I avoid any type of logo or design on the front
I tend to wear solid colours in a darker pallet, with very limited pattern
I like to play with length/layers and mismatching textiles to create texture
Why would I pay to advertise a brand
Is it just so people will know what brand I'm wearing  and thus how much I spent on said item
I think it's ugly and tacky
But I understand that a lot of people don't agree, and that's fine
In Norway, probably every person wears this
I dont know a single teenager who doesnt wear gant, levis, Nike, adidas, polo, etc
As long as they are not too big or imposing, I don't really care
As long as it is comfortable and looks half-decent
Same here
Plus, I don't want to be some kind of walking advertisement
I’d probably fall on the UK, granted it’s been a few years since I’ve been there but the last time I was in London, (which was also the first mind you) gave me a feeling of a kind of superiority
A lot of employees you could classify as “home-grown brits” looked down on me for not speaking with a perfect English accent even though as someone else in this thread said that most brits are monolingual
And though the tube was efficient, the map showing where the lines go are
Really confusing if you’re just taking a quick glance to get an idea of where you want to go
But to hack on another country other than the UK I would probably call out my home country of Norway
Especially after COVID hit, I’ve lost all confidence in our current government and feel that other European countries handle the situation at least a bit better than we do, plus’s it’s expensive as hell to live here so, you know
Edit: most brits seem like they’re monolingual, it’s just pulling everyone under the same comb to say none of you are
Do they really project a different image
I’ve never been to Athens, but I’ve always heard Athens is big, dusty, hard to get around in and unappealing
I’ve figured there’s a reason why most people have never been there, compared to other big Mediterranean cities
I would love to go one day though
> In my view only snow-white albino people lived there
Side-note: I recently talked to someone about Seattle
Because Seattle has the same size population as Oslo
And about the same amount of people with African descend
He blamed the black for all the problems in Seattle, so I asked him to explain why Oslo doesn't have the same problems as Seattle
In 2019 there were 7500 break-ins in Seattle
500 in Oslo
So 15 times (!) more in Seattle
Meaning the skin colour of the people in the two cities can't explain it
> the UK can be more efficient in many areas,
This is the test: how long can it take to evict a tenant who has stopped paying rent
In the UK it can take up to 6 months
How long does it take in Germany
I really loved Paris when I visited
In many ways it was everything I imagined
But I had watched very few French films
I love London but I really feel like it’s an acquired taste
British architecture and city planning is very unique
The first time I went I thought it was a quite ugly city especially due to all the brown bricked buildings (seriously why is every damn building in the entire UK brown
), but now I don’t think it’s ugly at all
Free Church people
I am guessing that is some sort of religious group
We have some small conservative religious groups that are judgemental nutcases, unfortunately
But I would say in general most people do not give a shit who you live with
The Free Church is shit
I'm sorry your stay was ruined by that kind of people
Where in Norway were you
I mean, there are a lot of deeply religious people in smaller towns, I won't lie, but this seems wild
I've never, *never* heard anyone experience something like that, and my closest relatives give 20% of their income to their evangelical church, we're they talk in tounges and have endless number of kids
Their own kids, several of them, lived with their partners before getting married
No one battered an eyelid
People living together outside marriage is very normal
Over half of children in Norway are born outside marriage
Also I just wonder, where is it you encounter these people
On social media
Work related
I dont think Ive ever heard someone say living together outside marriage is bad
> Wait, every french family has its own washing machine and dryer
Only for people in apartment buildings share in Switzerland I assume
In my previous apartment, we had a washing machine for sharing in the basement where we had to pay with a special card and stuff
It worked out fine, but now I live in an apartment with my own washing machine (in the bathroom, which is the most common
Some houses have its own washing room), and it's soooo much better
No extra paying, no scheduling, don't have to go out of my apartment to do so etc
I dont remember there being any major protests against covid regulations here
But we dont have very strict regulations
I visited paris about 20 years ago when I was around 12 so I wasn't old enough to have any romanticised view of Paris
The city was extremely dirty, there were homeless people living under every bridge, and as I was waiting a bit away from my family an adult man started chatting me up in french
0/10 will never go there again
I would dare say that it's probably the same here as in Sweden
Like every country, we also have a *small amount* of religious freaks who judge other people for not living up to their moral standards, but it's by no means common
I used to live in northern Sweden
I asked some old Swedish friends what they thought of Sweden's approach to covid around the time it started to become clear the countries approach wasn't succeeding, and they got incredibly offended and defensive
I was polite, honestly just trying to gauge their opinion of the situation, and how things were in the town i used to live in, but it seemed to really hit a nerve
Edit fixed a few mistakes, made it a bit clearer
May I suggest you try the fjordier brother as well
[Here] are [two] examples from Oslo
I love London, red bricks and all
People who complain about London or Paris, or other big cities have wrong expectations in my opinion
I am a country girl, but there are things found in cities you cannot find elsewhere
(Love the museums)
Yeah you were unlucky somehow getting mixed up in a sect crowd
I’m in Oslo and I know very few religious people, not to mention extremists
Though I have heard about those denominations, so they definitely exist
Im sorry to hear that
Those people are really stepping out of their boundaries trying to tell you what to do
I’ve taken the green line LOTS of times, my wife’s family lives on one of the stops near Piraeus, and I’ve never had any trouble at all
And I look very foreign when we visit
Maybe it’s because I’m with an insider, but I have never felt unsafe on the Athens metro
I also find the history of smog interesting
I heard a story yesterday when one day people couldn't see their feet because the smog was so bad
Very true
My fostermoms last name is Larsen :)
Yes, in Norway the most common surnames are all patronymic-style, but most people have a surname based on a place name, commonly the name of a farm some ancestor came from
I'm a teacher, and I just checked the list of names for one of my classes
Twenty of the students have clearly Scandinavian last names, and of those, only four end in -sen or -son
I'd say that's fairly typical
Had a friend in primary school who's parents were named Petersen and Pettersen
Only kept one for my friend though
Edit
Not what you're thinking about, but fun anyways
Not at all
Not only is English easy for Norwwgians to learn but the alternatives are worse
Either a completely different language like Chinese would dominate or we wouldn't have a dominating language effectively forcing us to learn a lot more languages
Yes
I hate how it infiltrates much of the Norwegian language, especially among the youth and my generation
I'm a student at a university and I correct mandatory exercises, and people often write a horrible mixture of English and Norwegian
It just seems really awkward and a bit pretentious, especially when there are well known Norwegian words for what they are mentioning
I love it
It’s not that hard to learn and about everyone talks it
Under certain circumstances it is indeed annoying
For example, when arrogant foreigners come to our country and expect (sometimes even demand) local people to speak English for their benefit
Implicitly, their behaviour sends the message "I insist on being in your country even though I do not value your language and culture at all
Cater to my preferences at all times
". Sometimes this results in absurd behaviours, like waiters at a restaurant (that are themselves clearly not native speakers of English)  acting like you are in the wrong for attempting to ask questions or make an order in the local language, or door sellers and charity muggers attempting to push stuff/beg for money without expressing themselves in the local language
No, absolutely not
i think it’s useful and the world needs a common language
my personal belief is that there should be two levels to language, the single unified common language to the world that (hopefully one day) everyone knows
and the myriad of small, regional languages that should be protected as cultural treasures
I'm just thinking: Thank goodness its not German
Their grammar is horrendous
But German would obviously still be better than Polish
Or Finish
I love the English language, I grew up with it alongside Norwegian
No, we need a lingua franca
But I do resent the nonsensical use of English by my own countrymen
E.g. when shops put up posters with "sale" on, or when artists name their works in English
Sweden: No
Finland: No
Russia: Yes - our fighters intercept Russian military aircraft violating our airspace on a weekly basis, and have done so for decades
So maybe it's not a fear of an invasion, but they certainly "rattle their sables" to put it that way
Their electronic warfare against Norway is also very unsettling
Russia is also testing "our seas"
I know someone who worked at the coast guard for years and the amount of times they would discover unauthorized russian ships/submarines lurking in our ocean claiming they "didn’t know" is annoying
A friend who was in the military up north for some time also told me that Russia sends threats to Norway more times than he could count
I can of course not confirm if this is true for sure, but honestly, if there is a country that would poke anyone with a stick, it’s Russia
Well, Norway's northernmost areas contain NATO's monitoring systems, observing all traffic to and from the Russian military bases in the Murmansk area, and we have for decades been NATO's ears and eyes towards that sector of the Barents Sea, and we can monitor the submarine traffic in and out of those waters better than any other NATO country and have done so since the start of the cold war
Since we also "own" Svalbard, we monitor this from two sides at the same time making it very hard for any submarine to slip into the Atlantic without us knowing
Of course, the Russians are not pleased about this, and have shown their displeasure by sending military aircraft of various types towards Norwegian territorial waters, expecting Norwegian fighters to intercept them before they enter said waters
They send [everything from MIG 29's to TU-95 (bear) strategic bombers and more]
I believe that it is mostly to keep us on our toes, and make a statement that they do not like our monitoring activities, but there has been at least one simulated exercise including naval vessels, submarines and aircrafts simulating an invasion of Norway
We're not overly worried about it, although maybe we should be, but we do trust that us being a NATO country keeps Russia from doing anything stupid
Well, the NATO exercise's purpose is twofold
One - to train on how to defend Norway against any invasion, and two - general training of NATO troops in harsh conditions
There is a big difference between training on how to invade and training how to defend ourselves should we ever be invaded
Well, the NATO exercise's purpose is twofold
One - to train on how to defend Norway against any invasion, and two - general training of NATO troops in harsh conditions
There is a big difference between training on how to invade and training how to defend ourselves should we ever be invaded
But can they be moved further away I wonder
A good friend in the norwegian marine is very worried
Well, that's why we're not too worried about it for the most part
The big commotion was as I said when the Russians played out a full blown invasion exercise in the Barents sea training on how to invade Norway
There were some political fallout after that
Land based radars, no
Out in the Barents Sea, yes most certainly
What they have done though is to distort GPS signals in the Northernmost parts of Norway, which actually disrupts civilian air traffic as well
[Please have a look at this article for more information
Well, yes they do conduct such exercises in Canada as well (Not Greenland to my knowledge) but that's the nature of NATO - if you are to train on how to defend Norway, you should train on Norwegian soil
And I thought it could be interesting for you to see how the Norwegian Military views this situation, so[here is an article posted by Geir Hågen Karlsen] who is a Lieutenant Colonel at the Norwegian Defense College
One quote from the article:
" Russia is the foreign state that tries to influence European politics and decision-making most, and more so than China and other states
These influence activities support three main Russian strategic objectives: regime security, predominance in Russia’s near abroad, and world-power status for Russia
The long-term objective of Russian influence activities is to weaken NATO and the EU
Everything Russia does, whether it is electronic surveillance, influencing elections or conducting military exercises are all tools to meet the aforementioned goals
It is a very good article, and I do recommend it
Just to add on this:
2017: [All commercial aircraft lost GPS signals for a week's time due to Russian GPS jamming]
2018: [several planes lost GPS signals due to Russian jamming during a Russian exercise]
2018: [Air ambulance lost GPS signals 250km from the border]
2019: [More jamming] "The Barents Observer reported that new radio-electronic warfare systems had been installed along Russia's Arctic coast
The systems can jam foreign ships, drones and aircraft thousands of miles away
2020: [Widerøe pilots frustrated about loosing GPS signals due to jamming] "The problem of jamming signals in the northernmost parts of Norway is becoming routine"
Not really, I don't remember the details that vividly
[The Russian training incident happened in 2015] (Invading Northern Norway, Åland, Gotland and Bornholm), and there was another one in 2017 where they trained on[an invasion of Svalbard] Finally,[there was an incident last year] where Russian naval and air forces trained further west and south along the Norwegian coast than ever before
I believe that those articles can shed some light and answer your question
The links are to auto-translated versions of the web pages, they are written in Norwegian but Google is getting better at translating Norwegian so I hope it isn't too bad
Russia's interest in Northern Norway is mostly military in nature
As I said Murmansk is Russia's only ice free port towards the Atlantic basin, and Russia is not happy with the way Norway can monitor their military buildup, submarine traffic etc
I can not document this, but I have heard that the Russian invasion plan was to cut Norway in half, leaving southern Norway alone (that is where most people live, and also where most of the industry in Norway is with the exception of some fish farming etc
Their play would be that the cost of re-gaining Northern Norway would be way too high compared to the industries and income we have from that part of the country
But again - it is unsubstantiated, although my source is a normally very well informed one
You are right, and also the NATO response (don't forget that the current Secretary General of NATO is Norwegian) ;) hehe
Does Québec-French count
(I'm half French-Canadian)
While not me directly, I have family members on my Norwegian side that speak Sami
Not a lot of people here learn Sami, I'd assume only samis learn Sami in school
I can understand Swedish spoken and written, but I can’t write or speak it
I can understand written danish, but spoken is a bit more difficult to understand
Its pertty commen to understand sweedish and be able to read danish in Norway :)
Im pretty shure sweedish people have no truble with norwegian either
I havent talked with that many danes, but they can probably understand sweedish and norwegian too
Yes, I just speak english when Im wisiting
But it helps that written danish is pretty easy to read though
Right now some friends are in denmark, the ferry has been canceld due to the storm
Hopefully it calm down tomorrow :)
Wouldn't that still technically count as a minority language
A quite large minority, yes, but still less than the rest of the country
Though given that this is a European-centric subreddit, I wondered if it was still relevant
I mean yeah, but how is that relevant
I'm well aware of what Québécois is, as I speak it myself
I know it's not it's own language
We're talking about how Québécois is a minority language in Canada because the majority of Canadians speak English
We have the largest proportion of electric cars in the world, and most of our energy comes from hydroelectric dams, so we're possibly the cleanest country in the world as well
But the money to build and maintain those dams we get from selling filthy oil to the rest of the world
Probably that oil will run out someday and that it's not sustainable
Also that while we produce 98% clean electricity, we export most of it, and then we import electricity from EU, which is around half fossile fuels
So the electricity that we put into those cars are what's called EU-mix, which is around 46% derived from fossile fuel [[Article in Norwegian] The net result is that the power we consume is around 40% non-renewable
As a Norwegian I'm probably guilty of this myself
I'm somehow super optimistic about our national team, and to be honest I have some reason for it
With all the good youth players we are producing at the moment
But at the same time we've failed and stumbled right before the finish line so many times now, and it's been 20 years since we last competed in a tournament
Would be interesting if we both meet in the play off final
Scotland having as big of a drought in Euro/WC participation as us I wonder if both of us are still going to find a way in not qualifying even if we meet in the final :/
I live in Norway and we complain a lot
It's just part of our nature I think
I mean - we are probably in the top 5 when it comes to living standards
Still we complain
We complain about our politicians, our health care, our roads, our elderly care, our school system
And if people find nothing else to complain about - they complain about the weather
I believe every single Norwegian should travel to a poor part of the world, at least once in their lifetime
Coming back they might complain less
I'm watching a Netflix series at the moment called "Diagnosis". It's about people in the US who has been trying for years to get a diagnosis to their rare disorder
But, while being sick, or having a sick child, they also have to deal with doctors suing them for unpaid medical bills, lower income due to the sickness (and denied disability money due to lack of a diagnosis), plummeting credit score and a mountain of unpaid hospital bills
Which comes on top of the worries for the person who's health is deteriorating
And I can relate, since my son has been to the hospital 5 times this year
But at least we don't have to give any thought to the finances since out out of pocket costs are $0, which includes the medicine he now gets twice a day
And the worries for your child's health is a heavy burden to carry, so how people survive mentally having the financial worries on top of that is hard to grasp
> The net result is that the power we consume is around 40% non-renewable
well as long as we *make* some renewable energy, surely who consumes it must be irrelevant
> I’d rather pay the uni directly
And health care
What is happening now is that we produce green energy, and then companies and persons in f.ex
Germany buy it
Then we feel good about ourselves for producing green energy while using non-renewable, and they feel good about themselves for buying green energy while producing non-renewable
My point is that we can't have our cake and eat it too
>You should do it even more, as Norwegian hydro is the only inexpensive way to deliver flexible, cheap, and low-carbon electricity
Of course, but right now we only produce around 140 TWh/yr and we consume around 130YWh/yr, so if we were to take all the hydro-electricity for ourselves, there would be only a negligible amount available for export
Our contribution in an international context is tiny
At least Portugal is a pretty damn good side, you're reigning champions
We've not been in a tournament for 20 years and will meet two World Cup semi finalists if we qualify
At least we should be able to compete with Czechia for 3rd
Nah I'm just messing with ya, it's da boys in green
Has to be Rangers
One example from my own life; My son has been to hospital 5 times this year
Including 4 ambulances, 1 ambulance helicopter, 1 surgery, 1 MRI, 2 EEG, 1 CT, medicine twice a day for 6 months (and ongoing), follow ups at the hospital, numerous blood tests and more
Living here the total out of pocket costs for it all is $0
What would it have cost you in out of pocket cost with your kind of insurance
(If you don't have children, lets pretend this happened to you instead of your child)
I know a little about the history of Egypt, Carthage, the Caliphates, and the "Barbary states", but not as much as I would like
I know a little about your situation now (on the whole, not that great), and your culture and ethnic makeup
But given that we get most of our knowledge from entertainment media (not school, as some people think), I probably know more about New Jersey than the whole of North Africa put together
It doesnt feel like we are related
I would say we are more related to the USA considering they are descendants of Europeans mostly
I know too little I'm afraid
I have learned though that Egypt is vastly different than Europe when it comes to culture, traditions and way of living
Which I find very fascinating since the country is located so close to Europe
Yet Europe seems to have had almost no influence at all
Since Egypt is such a popular tourist destination I expected the rest of the world to have more influence I guess
A friend travelled around Morocco alone some years ago
She says she LOVED being there
People were super friendly and she never felt like she was in any danger - in spite of being a woman travelling alone
Also the food was very nice she says
Edit: And such an interesting topic
Thank you for posting
Honestly next to nothing
Then again, the north pole is as far away from where I grew up as the middle of algeria
My experience:
I learned a bit about ancient Egypt in school
In French I learned about French  speaking countries in Africa, (mainly Algeria)
And in history we learned about colonization
But that’s about it
I in Norway way know enough about the countries
But I don’t know enough about a lot of European countries either
It’s a shame
I don't know much about North Africa and Africa in general, I don't consider the region to be Europe but many do
I just know that most of you speak Arabic, are Muslim, have desert and have hot weather
Well, it is far
Would actually prefer the civil war over the Viking age, seems like a more interesting time period for an AC game
I live in Norway so I guess that's already happening (sort of), even if AC: Vallhalla is apparently going to to be mostly in the British isles rather than Norway
I would say that either in Viking times or in ww2 occupation
Maybe the time of King Harald Hardråde and the invasion of Britain in 1066
If not that, I guess Valhalla will do
Hope they do this next
Viking is happening
Yeah, but I've heard it's mostly as a viking in the UK and not in Scandinavia :(
Accidentally
Isn’t it a chrismas movie
Tři oříšky pro Popelku is the Norwegian tradition, it's kinda a surprise for me that it's not that for you
Say what now
Østfoldinger
Rånere
Navere: people on welfare (Nav is the Norwegian welfare administration)
Harryfolk: particularly uncultured people (the name Harry, for some reason, has become an adjective meaning uncultured, unsophisticated, vulgar)
Tryhard rednecks
Bondeknøll
Basically same for Norway except we call them 'Rånere'.
It is fun to hear that fanaticism is linked to lower class, just like the stereotypical Jesus loving rednecks of Texas
Every Turk I personally know in Norway, 2nd gen or above, has higher education
It's the easy access to Swedish alcohol prices no doubt
I think it comes down to not having much else to do than drinking and being into cars
Having a car also becomes a lot more important the more remotely you live
While people absolutely still are into cars and there are enough shitfaced kids burning rubber, it feels like the entire phenomenon of the "classic" raggar is a bit past its heyday
The proper old school ones you see now appear to be pretty organised and proper
I know someone with a table like this
I had no idea, but this fits right in
I guess they can be a bit like that, but the families of both my friends are very secular, and have intermarried with Norwegians
You should check out a turkish band called Altin Gün. It modern turkish synt pop/disco inspired by the psychedelic and progressive rock of 70s. It's incredible
Do you find some Norwegian dialects easier or harder to understand
What about Finnish and other Uralic languages
"Nice to meet you
How are you doing
" – Did I get that right
Oh, nice
I'm a little proud of myself now, ha ha
Word for word it would actually be quite similar in Norwegian:
*"Gaman å kynnast med deg
Korleis har du det
Written using more old fashioned orthography it would look something like this:
*"Gaman å kynnast med dér. Korleîs hev du dat
You might notice that the more old fashioned example is slightly closer to Icelandic
However, this is a strange choice of words, so it would be much more natural to say it like this instead:
*"Hyggjeleg å møta deg
Korleis har du det
I didn't recognize the Icelandic word *hvernig* either, but it made sense based on the context
It seems to be a bit more closely related to the less common word *korso* (common in spoken Norwegian, but rarely seen in writing), which developed from Old Norse *hversu*, but in it's modern form, any previous similarity between them is pretty much unrecognizable
>"Hyggjeleg" also sounds like the Icelandic word "Huggulegt", which means "cozy".
That's basically what it means in Norwegian too, but it's a bit difficult to translate perfectly into English
It's a pretty common term, so it can mean different things depending on the context
Maybe this applies to Icelandic as well
>Møta also sounds more like something influenced by english
Møta- meet
Just a thought
Interesting idea, but I'm afraid you are wrong here
It's actually from Old Norse *mœta*, which might be familiar to you since it still exists in Icelandic, but perhaps it's not as common in Icelandic
Edit: I forgot to add this, but since English is also a Germanic language, it's just a coincidence that it's also kept the same word from Proto-Germanic, but it doesn't appear to have been borrowed from English to Norwegian or vice-versa
The Norwegian *møta* is also used similarly to how you used it in your example sentences, e.g. "Eg møtte klokka åtte" is also a valid sentence in Norwegian
>And also you got me thinking, maybe møta and meet have the same origin-  mæta
Since Old Norse significantly influenced English
I'm no linguist  but I think it might makes sense
I looked into it, but it seems that the word just survived independently in English, Norwegian and Icelandic
Norwegian and Icelandic obviously got it from Old Norse, English kept it from Old English, but all three languages are Germanic languages and have had the word since Proto-Germanic, so about 2000 years ago, it would be *mōtijaną*. Obviously it's changed a lot since then, and it changed differently in each language
>Also one question as I was trying to look this up some days ago but  found nothing
Many people have told me that northern Norwegians, mostly  older people have no difficulty speaking to Icelanders
Speaking as a person from Northern Norway, the answer is no
When I hear Icelandic spoken, I can usually only make out a little bit of it
I don't think my older relatives would find it much easier
However, there are some western Norwegian dialects, particularly in the Sogn area, which has a lot of similarities to Icelandic
I believe that's where most of the original Icelandic settlers came from, and they brought their dialect with them
For reference, here are two clips: The first one is of a person from Northern Norway, and the other is of a person from Hafslo, deep in the Sognefjord in Western Norway
Which one do you understand best, if at all:
[Hafslo, Western Norway]
[Bjarkøy, Northern Norway]
You can also try listening to [this clip] from Setesdal, in Southern Norway
It's often often considered one of the most conservative Norwegian dialects, so I'm curious about how much you'd understand
In the good old days I believe an axe was used
There are also accounts of people being executed by being put in a barrel and pushed down a cliff
In more recent times, it was by gunfire
Axe
Blood eagle
Your ribs are split opened down your back, lungs are pulled out and placed on your shoulders, then you stayd like that until you died
If you screamed or showed pain during the ritual, you wouldn't reach Valhalla
Bloodeagle
Yeah, the last execution for a non-war crime (murder) was in 1876 and was indeed decapitation by axe
Last war crime (treason) execution was by firing squad in 1948
As for the "weird" techniques there was indeed drowning, burning, and the [breaking wheel ] used
Please, educate us
Obviously English is mandatory and at least in my school we started having English class in English in videregående (upper secondary school/high school)
I don't know if this counts but since we have two writing systems, most have to learn some of the non-standard system for your municipality (e.g. I had to learn nynorsk bc here we write in bokmål)
Though that's written language, not spoken
Other than that you usually do the usual choosing between French, Spanish or German (or more English if you struggle)
In uni about half of my classes have been in English I'd say (though I've no idea if this is only my study area or not
I study linguistics)
But other than that, classes in all schools are in Norwegian, unless you go to a specific school that teaches in say French or Farsi or Urdu
not any really
Maybe the Samer (native people) up north, but I have never heard any serious takes on this
They have it pretty good with tax breaks and other benefits, so I bet they are not complaining
There is even a [movement] dedicated to digging Scania away from the mainland completely
penis and piss
both are tiss
Teppe - carpet and blanket
Vote, voice, something's right and to tune is stemme in norwegian
Stutter, to derive from, tribe and tree trunk is stamme in norwegian
in a spoken sense we have the same, but written differently
måne - moon
måned - month
depending on the dialect the d is silent
Same in norwegian, "drage"
same here "gift" (which means both poison and married lol)
but im pretty sure making that difference is pretty rare and english is the weird one
Also "to pull".
Pull is "å dra" and "å trekke".
Du kan no bøye ordet dra å sjå kva du får.
OK school systems
Physically close to UK and with historic relations
Very similar languages that makes learning English easy
Small countries with limited availability of stuff in their own languages
Dutch and the Scandinavian languages are very similar to English
One simple, but important thing is sentence structure which is close to similar
This makes the grammar kind of intuitive for the most part, with some exceptions
We learn it in school, but i think a big reason now is because of the internet, everyone uses it and theyre bound to come across a lot of English there
I think 2 and 3 are less important considering how well the Finns do
I hope we never start dubbing even if we get large
I think it's a result of the other four
More dubs mean less availability of original content some of the time
Mostly in cinemas
If there was a Norwegian version of Final Fantasy 8, I probably would have played that
But instead I had to learn English
That's more or less number 4 of my original list, but I didn't intend to make it a ranking :)
"This guy are sick" from VII was certainly helpful in learning the whole is/are thing
Country then region
I've got relatives from all over the country and feel at home anywhere in Norway
City first, then country
Oslo being the only true big city in the country, in many ways it feels different than anywhere else in the country
Being a big (ish) city brings both benefits and challenges that you won’t find anywhere else in the country, and this is often completely lost on people not living here, instead they will just simplify it as «Oslo think they’re the centre of the world” when anything unique to Oslo is brought up
I still very much identity as Norwegian though
Norway first and foremost, then to people from my area/region I may use my home village more, although not many has actually heard of it
My region doesn't really have much regional pride or anything so that's not something most identify with
Nation first, and the island I am from second, and that is a strong second
It is kind of weird to say this, but it is almost like a calling, I tried to live on Dovre a while (high on the mountain) but I yearned back to the sea and to the island, same thing happened when I visited Czhech Republic and England, but that was more for the nation
Agree
Bergen does that to you
That's interesting
Kaffi, kahveli and hantuuki translated to my Norwegian dialect is "kaffi", "gaffel" and "håndduk" ("handduk" in other dialects)
Cartoon tv, books, games, being with friends, Donald Duck, smoke bombs, drawing, football
Me and a friend built a fort out of planks and rocks, which was moved between three locations over the span of five or six years
We were massively into medieval stuff, and my dad even made us swords and shields out of wood and leather
When we reached our teens, however, we started gaming more
Fifa, World at War and 007: Nightfire mostly
I miss those days, but they're good memories
Watching cartoons, playing with barbies, reading books and comics
Also making my own comics
Playing habbo hotel  and other online games
Waching TV, playing computer games, videogames, go swimming in a small lake, playing around in the woods, climbing trees, jumping on the trampoline, cycling around, driving around with a electric scooter or skateboard (with a very week motor), just hanging with friends and do all kinds of stuff, o and making snowcaves
Edit: I'm from Northern Norway btw
Pronounciation, funnily enough
I always almost either lisp the C or say pro-NOUN-ciation
Anything ending with '-dy' or '-ly'. 'Tragedy' for instance
Subtlety
I can say it if I speak freely, but if I have to read that shit you’ll hear sub-t-let-y
‘Earth’ always becomes either ‘eeff’ or ‘ørt’ for me
Also, as a conductor, if I tell the band or choir to play ‘thirds’ it always comes out as ‘turds’.
Thrice
The r sound when it comes right after the "th" sound is very difficult here, even though "three" is simple enough to say
"Clothes". I consider my English to be good enough that I could pass for a native speaker (for a couple of sentences), but "clothes" wrecks both my brain and my tongue
It ends up as either "close" or a complete trainwreck of a word that sounds more like "cloths".
Somewhat ironically for someone with a Google home, "Ok, Google". I always stumble saying it
I wish you could change it to something easier like "Halla Hjørdis
That was my first thought as well
Words like this that are stressed weirdly (and not used that often), or words that are similar to Norwegian but stressed differently, like "par**en**thesis" ("paran**tes**" in Norwegian)
As an Oslogutt, archipelago is my nemesis when i'm trying to explain our fjordlandskap to foreigners
oh god please have mercy
Asked my french friend to say focus and she sounded like a scot saying "fock us" legit dead
[This comes to mind]
[Phenomenon
du-du du-du-du
PHENOMENON
Du-du du du~]
Actually it is "Parentes"
Haha bilingual here
I was reading all the words here to see how people find it difficult, and then I see hyperbole and said hyperbowl
Took way to long to hear the correct pronunciation when I was young, and apparently the mispronounciation still lingers
Reminds me of hegemony
Pronounced something like Hedge-eh-mehni, but for the longest I said hedge-a-moany
How else would you pronounce it
Those are difficult
Come on
Here, let me show you how easy it is:
Rrr
Rrrr
Hmm
They are pronounced the same, but «beach» is longer
But I’m not surprised Catalan or Spanish speakers might have trouble with this, since a big difference between those languages and English is that English has varying vowel lengths while Catalan/Spanish does not
Odd
my spellchecker didn't strike out on it
it would explain a whole lot
Sure, it's not a big issue, and the problem is usually that the flow is lost mid-sentence if there's a word I know how to stress, but have to process consciously first
Mate we call bags, like shopping bags, 'pose' (pronounced poo-seh) and sausage is called 'pølse' (pronounced Pøl-seh, the ø sound is akin to the o in 'touch'), and when you're in a supermarket, the bags are behind the counter and the cashier asks you if you want a bag by just saying 'pose
', and my aussie mate deadass thought they were asking him if he wanted sausage with his purchase for a good three months when he just moved here lmaoo he was like ew no thank you
if you mean dropping to dg- and only say g, then yes, that is okay
The way that I wrote it is the way I have always heard it being pronounced however
But is that actually how anyone would pronounce it
Wouldn’t that first s just be silent or are you actually meant to pronounce it
Having been to Finland and Japan, they don't feel similar at all
And before someone else steals my bad joke, Germany and Argentina
As for Norway
Can't really think of any
Japan feels oddly similar to all the Nordic countries, in a very uncanny way
I love Japan, which I have visited twice, and it seems to me like some sort of ScandiAsian Twilight sone
It's not really about the culture, but the aesthetics
The use of wood and ceramics, and the focus on design and crafts makes it sometime impossible to distinguish between a ramen bar in Tokyo or a coffee bar in Stockholm
And add to that, both regions/countries are rather close on the [Inglehart-Welzel cultural map]
I have never visited Australia or New Zealand, but whenever I meet someone from those two countries there's for some reason a cultural similarity that feels stronger than the one towards the UK
It probably has something to do with the existing close ties between the Nordic region and the anglosphere combined with a preference for unformality and classlessness that we do not find in the UK
Hmmm, maybe Greece for their metal bands
Minnesota does have a lot Norwegian-Americans, and I do like the Minnesota Vikings
Also, Pepsi is our national drink
Canada has the second-highest number of Norwegian descendants after the US, and the weather is similar
New Zealand
They seem to be aware of their relative insignificance, but they're still a very nice little country, with some very nice nature
Norway and New Zealand, despite being about as far away from each other as physically possible on this earth, it was weirdly familiar when I visited
Though that was after I spent almost 5 months in Australia on exchange
Canada is apparently not all that different from the Scandinavian countries
I haven't been there, but from what i hear of canada through news and people talking about it, it really feels like the North American Scandinavia
I kind of get it
They are both composed kind of people
They both like to stand nicely in lines without anyone trying to cheat
They like their personal space
But work culture is of course vastly difference, and for instance the view on mental illness I would say is much more healthy in Finland
I’m thinking Canada and Norway for some reason
This was my first thought
The kids aren't "Americanised" they're just swedish
Minnesota would also be a good choice
For the nature, Alaska is more similar
Damn I'm very good at observing if a picture is taken in Norway, I just find something unique about our landscape and flora
But this really does look like Norway, if you didn't tell me I would probably mistake it as from here
What little they have kept is mostly of a culture from long ago
It's also very much watered down with general American culture
I did my exchange there
It really is sweet
It's like a time capsule from the past
Also, the Minnesota Vikings and their war chant is truly unique
I would say Seiland national park
I would say its one of the most beautiful areas in northern norway
Its not really unique but its the closest thing to it
There's plenty of fjords and mountains where I live, but there's nothing unique to that - there's fjords all over Norway
But one of the things that tourists often overlook when they visit Norway is the skerries - the tens of thousands of small islets that's scattered all along the coast, and protects the coast from harsh weather
The skerries have been used by farmers for grazing since the bronze age, and is a truly unique landscape
[Lygra] is a a part of a bigger island just north of the city of Bergen, where I live
It's not spectacular, because all the islands are truly spectacular
It's just a good example of that particular landscape
Close by, perhaps [Magalaupet]
A little further away, there’s [Torghatten] which with the right timing, you can watch the sun shine through the mountain
We got the worlds strongest tidal current [Saltstraumen] (20 min drive), the view from our bedroom window [Børvasstindan] coincidentally above Saltstraumen
[Keiservarden] (Emperor's Cairn), named in honour of Kaiser Wilhelm II who visited it in 1891, it has a [wonderfull view] of the city and the surrounding landscape, and on clear days you can even see the Lofoten "wall" way way in the distance
There's a lot of nice mountains around Tromsø. To name a couple that are spectacular
Hamperokken 1404 m [
&#x200B;
Store blåmann 1044 m
Something cozy about taking a hike on top of the mountains
Its really nice with the fresh air and the nature
Privacy
I’ve heard some stuff about privacy problems regarding zoom, but I never really knew what they were
Thank you, this makes much more sense
A friend of mine who lives abroad got his entire zoom chat hacked while he was having a class by some Vietnamese guys and they started speaking French
The teacher just responded to all of it by leaving lol
We have a small town called Hell
If you take a plane to Trondheim, you will land in Hell
We have Hell as an «international» one
Other small ones I found:
Møkkalasset = «big pile of shit»
Ræva = «the ass»
Tissvassklumptjønnin = «piss water lump lake»
Svenskehølet = «the Swedish hole»
Rompeporten = «the gate of the ass»
Drittsekktjønn = «shitbag lake»
Fettavika = «pussy bay»
Lortegrauten = «the shit porridge»
Hell
Literally, it's called hell
We have hell, pretty classic
Hell, Norway
It's worth noting that "hell" in Norwegian actually means "luck"
There’s a Norwegian town called hell, which also means luck in norwegian
i live near a place called The End of the World here in norway aswell
And Hell is less than 1 km away from one of the biggest airports in the country (Værnes)
Why they didn't name it "Hell International Airport" is beyond me
Sædballe is my personal favorite
Also Paradis and Helvete which means hell
ours is named so because when you’re there there’s no land out towards the sea, not until you would hit denmark
I would personally not use those sentences, but I do enjoy poems that happen have a similar phrase or two in them
I don’t magically turn religious, they are idioms and figures of speech
I am not an atheist, but rather agnostic, and although I enjoy the idea of someone watching over me from above - or that I one day might be together with all my lovely pets again
it has less to do with religion and more to do with a “I like this thought” and “it’s a nice way to put it”.
Same; although I'd personally classify myself more of an atheist, I'm not at all militant about it
I don't say religious phrases to people or anything (we're pretty secular, after all), but I still think funeral services in churches are nice
Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable
[Wikipedia]
Atheism, in the broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of deities
Less broadly, atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist
In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities
[Wikipedia]
Which in my mind translates very clearly to the fact that an atheist believe that there is no God
An agnostic person cannot prove that a God exist, nor that he doesn’t exist
An atheist is certain, an agnostic is not
No one can prove it, but an atheist has a clear belief
I genuinely had someone in the US ask me if we rode polar bears to school
I remember it happening three times that they asked directly
\- First was in Paris, which only led to the dude asking whether I wanted to pay in Euro or in crowns (using their exchange rate, which is typically worse for me than what VISA offers)
\- Second was in København: I went to the State Museum of Art, showed my tourist card (which gave discounts) and requested a ticket
Dude muttered something in heavily Danish-accented English even though I'd made an effort to imitate their pronounciation
For the record, Danish tourists and workers I've encountered in my own country always assume that I understand their toungue
I bluntly told him my nationality and that I expected him to speak Danish, which made him relent and say something about "Norwegians always wanting us to speak Danish".
\- Third time was in Berlin, some dude claiming to be from Italia was asking for the way to the Autobahn in accented German
Thing is, he was on the 17th June street, with the Brandenburger Tor behind him and the Siegessäule visible in the distance, plus he had a road map
I suspected he was one of those scammers pretending to be travelling luxury clothing salesmen, so I told him a true story about one I encountered in Roma when I visited that city
At one point he asked where I was from and when I told him he claimed to have visited our capital
No specific questions about the country, though
Depending on the asker, usually something about vikings, football, elves, hipster music, bankers, fucking your cousin
Often people ask too why I don't have a -son patronymic, if they're aware of the Icelandic naming system
While I was studying abroad, my teacher kind of forgot where I was from
I came back from the holidays after visiting my family in Norway and he was like “ah
How was Norway
Or was it Sweden
Nah
pretty sure it was Denmark
Well, *are* you a mafioso
I've had people doubt my Norwegian-ness  just because I'm not blonde
Fucking your cousin
"oh, Norway
Do you know my friend x?"
Sir there are 5 million people here ~~also yes what the fuck how do I actually know them what are the odds~~
Not on the mainland, but I can't speak for Svalbard lol
I totally prefer my polar bear to the reindeer
I mean, I totally prefer riding the polar bear to the reindeer
Yep, I prefer the polar bear to the reindeer
It's annoying, but it was quite weird and unsettling the one time I actually knew the person they were referring to
They were someone who went to the same school as me
Oh yes
It's still snowing
In Oslo we had a little bit of snow in December, none in January
No, I haven't seen snow, but I live pretty far south and near the coast
Currently over 1 metre where I live in Northern Norway
It has been snowing since late October interrupted by mild weather in late December and early January
Yes, but extremely little for the entire winter so far
I don't mind not having to wade through slush and make deals with the devil every time I need to step foot outside, but it is just a bit concerning
The last time it was below essentially 0 here was more than two weeks ago(!) and it hasn't been properly cold even once this entire autumn/winter
Yes
Not as much as last winter and back, but still lots of snow
It’s been a warm winter though, but it’s not my impression that there’s been little snow
Less of it yes, but we’ve still had much snow throughout the winter
Yes, though much of it rained away during the new years storms, then came back over the last week or so
Tromsø is really mild compared to back home in Finnmark, but when it snows here it comes by the meter it seems
Last year we had only a thin layer of snow until well into january in Finnmark, but this year the snow levels have been more normal over there
Trondheim, been snow most days, got it fairly early in october or early november
Some days in January and December with virtually no snow on the ground though which is rather rare, also warm temperatures
Got a lot of a snow a couple days ago but quite a bit of it has rained away
A little bit
Mostly rain tho
Had snow yes, but it's been plus degrees for a month now, so most of it has melted
It's an extremely warm winter though, usually we'll have -5° to -25° at this time of year with a lot of snow
No snow in eastern Norway
1 cm
Melted the next day
It's snowed like 3 days or something this winter
It snowed a fair bit in November though
It kinda feels like we just jumped from november to march
Strangest of all, take a look at this picture I took when I was walking my dog:
This is completely abnormal for a Norwegian January
It's the same here in Norway
Not at all here
That's good
We've only had a little bit of snow here in Trondheim, and for the most part, the temperatures have been like a cold summer day
Not sure I like the development
Depends on where you are
I live in Voss and we've had a couple of days of snow in the lowlands and a lot in the mountains
I'm in Tromsø
I'm from Bergen, and there really has been no sign
That makes sense then
The climate around Bergen is very affected by the warm water coming in from the Atlantic
If you go to the mountains, Oppland/Hedmark or further north, you'll find snow
I saw this just a week ago
Yeah I know, but it's the fact that there usually is snow here
Further north to nordhordaland where my cottage is, there still hasnt been any snow
(It's a countryside unaffected by pollution and climate)
We've had christmas snow there 8 years in a row, so it really is concerning
I have never met a single person that has ever done teleshopping
I haven't seen that on TV for many years
I asked my mom about it and she remembers buying tupperware through teleshopping in the early 2000s.
I remember seing teleshopping shows as a kid where they were selling workout equiptment and such
[Maybe this one
This is King Olav riding the subway to go skiing during the oil crisis of 1973
There was a driving curfew, and in solidarity with the people he used (and paid a ticket for) public transport
The picture reflects one of the most notable qualities of norwegian society, egalitarianism
A bit late to the party, but this picture of Line Nersnæs after the 2011 bombing in Oslo is probably a good contender for this title:
What a great question
Enjoying reading through the comments
I would say this one
Of the UNESCO listed Geiranger fjord
Ok, that made me a bit teary-eyed
Love her facial expression
Oooh, that's a good suggestion
Was trying to think of a picture and the only one I came up with was this one of Max Manus and Crown Prince Olav on his return to Norway after WW2:
Was thinking of the same photo
Just wanted to check if someone beat me to it
> The picture reflects one of the most notable qualities of norwegian society, egalitarianism
And may we always keep this foundation of our culture
[This one as well] 1969 photo of Prime Minister Per Borten being scantily clad while preparing his farm for an official visit by Queen Elizabeth and King Olav
The photo led to much merriment and was even published in Sweden and Britain
How did he take those photos
She was impaled by a 30cm splinter of wood
Basically, she got lucky:
Citizens of microstates, what are some advantages or disadvantages of living in your country
Edited for clarity: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican State
Let a man dream
I like you
I don't know what I expected when I made this post tbh haha
luxembourg has a lot more pop relatively
at 560k vs
460k for malta
and i don’t see what you mean with estonia, it has almost tripple the pop
and finally the term "microstate" refers to the small area, not necessarily population
No, you're not a microstate
Let's see who is going to answer from the Vatican
based on what i could find a microstate is best defined as a sovreign state that has sacrificed some of its sovereignity to another country to make it economically and politcally viable despite a big demographical and geographical constraint
so this definition makes it so any nation that is tied to another because of small size and population is considered a microstate
so that means nations like monaco, andorra, the vatican and san marino would be considered a microstate
this definition doesn’t include malta however
there is no clear definition to what is considered a microstate, but it’s usually quite clear what is and isn’t. generally the consensus of who the microstates in europe are is Malta, Andorra, San Marino, Vatican, Liecthenstein and Monaco
microstates have a small population and a small land area
and by that i mean very small, cyprus and luxembourg don’t really fit that bill
also also, i have no idea where you get your numbers from, because Cyprus’ population is around 1
1mill
you should do some research before spouting false info
8 years is a long while
*"There's a lack of housing development, however the neighbors won't bother you
We do not like to admit this since Sweden is our rival country, but if we meet a hot Swedish girl/dude, we totally melt because they sound so sexy
(Don' tell anyone
Ask us tomorrow and we will deny everything)
All of the Slavic languages (especially the balkanic Slavic), Romanian and Japanese
I personaly have to say the Sami language and German, they have such a nice ring to it
I always found Swedish to be a beautiful language
(I know
Then you haven’t heard me speaking
But I agree that icelandic flows well
Same here, i remember this clip that aired in between programs on the Discovery channel when i was younger
Hmm
Depends on the regional dialect for me
Some Swedish sound constantly naggy and in a state of dumbfoundedness, which is very annoying
But others sound quite nice
Sorry, but I think brazilian portugese sounds better
In some parts they speak portuguese with more music, they sing the vocals and they have more nasal sounds that sounds a bit french or italian
European portuguese is "harder", more flat - if that makes sense
I can't point out a spesific thing, Swedish sounds very cute and charming
I think it is partly the melody and part the different words you use
You sure about [that
It has a nice tone to it
So do some Norwegian dialects
But overall Swedish wins
Oh god no
/r/murderedbywords
Well, take out kings and focus only on prime minister (and the historical titles who had the same function)
We have had a few foreign ones, mainly from Sweden, Denmark and Germany
Mind you this was all well over 100 years ago
Yes, only our last king was born in refugee in tjhe UK during WW2
If you don’t count an union as occupation Norway has been ruled by foreign monarchs throughout most of it’s history from around the 15th century to our independence in 1905
But Haakon VII and Olav V were born in Denmark so our current monarch Harald V (1991-present) is our first Norwegian-born monarch in a very long time
But luckily Haakon VII was very good at adapting to the Norwegian culture and Olav V was mostly raised in Norway
wasn't he an honorary chief of a native american tribe too
And if we count the royals, the last King Olav V and his father King Haakon VII were danish born
Haakon was the brother of the danish king and was asked to become king of Norway when we got our independence from Sweden in 1905
To add to the whole thing, King Olav V was born in England
Damn, didn't know that
Kongehuset has pretty decent [biographies] for a lot of members of the royal family, including King Haakon, King Olav and Queen Maud
There's also a nice family tree, lol
American teacher tried to teach the whole class that Norway was allied with Germany during WW2
She did not believe me when I said we were occupied
It ended up with the whole class googling everything she claimed to be true that wasn’t in the textbook, because no one believed her anymore
I grew up in the US, so, some of the dumbest things were
In grade school: There's this thing called God that created this thing and that thing
In high school: Scandinavia isn't a part of Europe
I don’t even know her reasoning
I tried telling her about how fought back, but she wouldn’t have it
She just said “I’m the teacher, I have a master in history
I know this, you don’t.”
Me as an exchange student in the US
Nope, she thought we were allied with Germany
She was in fact a history teacher
Maybe even Africans
Yep, they always make so much sense
Hey that’s me
But I’m actually a girl who went to high school in the US
Otherwise, yep that’s me
Haha yeah I wondered why someone would comment here now
I’m back in Norway yes, currently attending university here
It was great in the states
I got some very good friends there, discovered I absolutely love horseback riding, and it’s cliché, I know, but that was one of the best experiences in my otherwise short life
Wouldn’t trade it for anything
Ah I see
Horseback riding is so much fun, I did western riding so barrel races and stuff like that
You should definitely travel when you’re done with your studies (and have enough money of course)
I think I wanna visit countries in Europe first
They still have Beethoven
Except Vienna is trying to steal Beethoven
No, I haven't heard of it
Although my family sorta celebrates it as it's a family member's birthday
It's called Helligtrekongersaften and haven't been celebrated since 1770
A vicar might mention it during mass if it falls to a Sunday, but that's about it
Traditionally it's the day when Christmas decorations are taken down
In medieval times it was often called "old Christmas eve" as a reference to the pagan Jul celebrations
Norse pagans celebrated "Midtvintersblot", the largest feast at the appearance of the first new moon after winter solstice, usually around that time
From Norway, I'd say a line from Arnulf Øverland's poem "Du må ikke sove" (You must not sleep)
*Du må ikke tåle så inderlig vell
den urett som ikke rammer deg selv
(English: You must not be so tolerant of
the injustices that do not befall you)*
The poem was written in 1936, and is about the rise of facism and nazism, and the dangers of inaction and indifference
EDIT - Minor change of the translation
Possibly the opening line from Henrik Ibsen's epic poem *Terje Vigen*:
"Der bode en underlig gråsprængt en på den yderste nøgne ø" (There lived a strange grizzled one on the utmost naked island)
Or Aust-Vågøy by Inger Hagerup:
" De brente våre gårder, de drepte våre menn
La våre hjerter hamre det om og om igjen" (They torched our farms, they killed our men
Let our hearts hammer it again and again)
I thought of this as well
It is iconic, important and often used to cast light upon injustice
This was my first thought, but I think also the poem Til Ungdommen is very well known - especially after the 2011 terror attacks
The full lyrics in a half-bad translation to English [here]
It’s paints a grim picture of being sorrouned by enemies, but fighting back with the belief in humanity and human dignity
Altough an urban fantasy with the trolls and all, "Trollhunter" is a really good depiction of Western Norway, with it showing the dramatic, but almost always cloudy and rainy scenery, and imo very funny and accurate jabs at Norwegian society with the predator hunting commentary and whatnot
Let me see

Conclusion: no
When I got some dutch friends to try and speak Norwegian, they actually sounded a bit swedish
To be honest, Nederland is like honorary- Scandinavians though haha
I can read an article in Dutch and understand like 80-90%.
Though I did study Dutch a couple of years ago so maybe I'm biased, but to me Dutch looks like a mix of German, English and Scandinavian
There's a bit from Berlin in the Bourne Identity, which isn't too bad
It's a native movie though, not foreign as the question is asking about
But I agree, that movie brought my childhood-nightmares to life haha
Disrespect nature, as in it could probably get you killed
Start a conversation with someone in a bus
It seems like every year there's a story about a tourist dying or needing rescue because they fell off a cliff
How do you fall off a cliff

Also, moose are indeed herbivores, but they can still ruin your whole vacation
Aw, come on, not even the slightest
She's so old now, that her time will come soon anyway
Don’t forget Norway
Ikea is the shit if you’re on a budget
Old Ikea was flimsy as hell, but the later years they’ve started offering sturdier design-like furniture, for uhm
not budget prices
Their budget stuff is still a little weak, but it will fill a house and work for a while, until you can buy other stuff
Ikea food is just normal food
It’s seen as the cheap option, but it is extremely common
Many people pride themselves in not having any furniture from IKEA
So did I, until I bought my bed there
A go to furniture store
Also they have good cinnamon rolls
Bad quality, but so cheap that we still shop there
Norwegian here
Ikea is seen as a cheap and cheerful generic brand that almost everyone buys products from, but definitely isn't seen as being exotic nor a luxury brand
Personally I pick up a lot of kitchen gear, storage and organisational furniture and supplies, candles, plants, and things like shelving
I have also owned a few Billy bookcases in my time
When I was younger (read, broke) most of my stuff was from ikea, but now that I'm older I can afford furniture thats of better quality
Still, that doesn't mean I stick my nose up at the brand, they have a ton of great stuff
Which is why *everybody* has their stuff
As for food, we have diam at the supermarket, so thats not a drawcard either, but their sausages are dirt cheap, and they do chocolate bars for next to nothing (I use them in baking a lot)
Also, good cinnamon rolls
I almost always buy a sausage and a soft drink when at their store
Their food sales must accout for at least a quarter of all sales
I'd say I go once a month to pick up something, as its down the road from me
Last time I popped in for coat hangers and new fitted sheets
Time before that I needed a new vegetable knife and a pot scraper
last bigger purchase was nordli drawers
But generally is smaller odds and ends
I feel like reddit makes Ikea look worse than they are honestly
They have some crap but also some good stuff
I can't really say they are like Herman miller but they aren't trying to be either
I find this an interesting aspect of Germany
I was in a birthday party once (in Norway)
Some close friends of the guy, a German couple, came all the way from Germany to join the celebration
A lot of people made speeches saying nice things about the guy (in Norway there are usually a lot of speeches made in both birthday parties and weddings)
The German guy wanted to say a few words, but before he addressed the guy who's birthday it was, he apologised to all the guests on behalf of Germany for the harm they had caused Norway during the war
It was such a huge surprise, not a single person there (all Norwegians) expected that at all
A very nice gesture, but totally unnecessary (all guests were 40 or younger except the parents of the guy)
But still very nice of him
> The funny thing is they said we are racist
The irony
I'd say it's sad that he felt the need to say anything
He wasn't born, he didn't make any decisions and he has no other connection to the war than being born in the country that started it
I think I'd cringe if I was at that party
> I think I'd cringe if I was at that party
I can't remember cringing, I think we felt more touched by it
And I think (some) Germans still feel responsible - not for causing the war, but for preventing Germany causing another war
Which I think is great
We should all remember the past and try to prevent the bad parts from repeating itself
lmao gotem
We don't really have bases per se, but there are US Marines more or less permanently "training" in inner Troms now
I don't mind, if only to stick it to the Russians
A few hundred Marines stationed 1000 km from the border is an act of aggression apparently, while the Russians can have tanks and nuclear missile subs right on the border, conduct mock attacks on radar sites, and "test" their jammers that disrupt civil aviation in East Finnmark, but even the slightest objection or hint at bolstering our defence in response is NATO imperialist aggression
Bread
Cheese
Strawberries
(Specifically Norwegian ones
The colder weather makes them taste sweeter than the ones grown in warmer climate)
I saw a documentary ones from a small village in Italy
We got to see the food storage of one of the ladies in the village, and oh my gosh all those nice salami looking meets hanging from the ceiling
Very impressive
And rows and rows of jars of canned food
The documentary was about the very long life expectancy in the village, and looking at the food they ate you understood why they seemed to live on forever
Yes
Good tasting tap water is a rather rare thing these days
I have yet to come across any desert that comes even close to proper vienna pastries (it might be called danish in english)
They are without a doubt the most delicious baked goods on earth
> and I had good cheeses from Norway (this sweet brown cheese),
You are a person of excellent taste
Brown cheese is good, but it's not a cheese
We've got other good cheeses though
Feta
Yum
I was once on vacation on a greek island with some friends, and the place we stayed at normally served greek salad as a side dish for lunch
My friends didn't like feta (how is that possible
), so they donated all their cheese to me
Naturally, I didn't protest :-)
We only buy bottled water when we need a bottle (for sports)
I think it is because they spend more time getting ripe, so they have time to develop more taste
But maybe more daylight also plays a role
> Everyone who visits the Nordic countries in summer really should try our strawberries
I agree
Those are the types of issues I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with
Sounds like a hassle
>English food is delicious when compared to scandinavian food
Not a fan of the New Nordic trend in gastronomy
You cant find bread with rice porridge topping anywhere else in the world I'm afraid
>That is a very enthusiastic way to say "bland grub" :D
I don't think the Nordic restaurant scene serves bland food at the moment - on the contrary, the New Nordic trend is a necessary revitalisation of fine dining
> It's the proper rye bread that I dont seem to get elsewhere
Denmark
Not that i have noticed
I only drink polish beer though
A six pack of beer costs around 18 euros here
Why would i pay 18 euros when i can buy a 6 pack of Tyskie for 5 Euros instead
Russia
I've been fascinated with it for quite a while
* Ancient civilizations (which are not Greek/Roman)
* East Russia
* Wars in Europe after 1990
* Colonialism and independence of the latin american countries
* Feudal Japan
These catch my eyes the most at the moment
Ah, so many
But my favourite is probably France
The origin of so many western ideas and modern principles
Philosophers, scientists, and conquerors
Revolution, warfare, and empire
From Vercingetorix, to Charlemagne, to Napoleon
If you think the history of France is too mainstream to be exciting it's only because you haven't dived deep enough
Admiral Yi is one of my most favourite historical characters
Such a badass mastermind
Just one aspect of Korea's fascinating history
Learning about how Japan went from living in a bubble closed off to the outside world to actually catch up with Western powers in terms of development over such a short span of time is incredible
I'm not completely sure
It might be because Russian story wasn't really taught much in school, but I think there's so much history that I think is interesting
Whenever we get a new book about Russia, Russian politics/history or anything in the bookshop I work in, I instantly want to read it
I find that the history of the eastern part of Russia is very interesting
Just looking at maps, reading the stories and history of the places
There is so much i don't know and i have never heard off
Most other parts of the world is quite easy information to gather, but it seems that particular part is rather, bypassed in general history
I would want to hangout in the Americas with Leif Erikson
8th of may 1945, the day we were independent again, after the nazis
The celebrations after that must have been anything like something since
Just looking at footage from the time is out of this world
I don't know what else I would want to see besides things like that as Norway wasn't particularily nice to live in for most of it's history
1263 or 1314
1263 because that's when Norway reached its territorial peak
1314 because, while having slightly less territory, Norway was arguably more powerfull then, than at any other point in the middle ages
1240 - 1319 is what is often said to be regarded as a norwegian golden age, so I suppose any point within those years would be good
Norway
Either from 17
May 1814, seeing the end of 400 years of Danish occupation, or any time between 830-1066
Is that what they named granola bar after
Like an americanised version of the name
"I just arrived in my fantastic boat
Tidenes beste norske sketsj
well i know the names of the swedish and british ones, and i know that the spanish one doesnt have any lyrics
nothing more than that though lol
You have the law of Jante as well
Germany can into the Nordic
Don't agree with that description
Flashing your wealth is not popular and most rich Norwegian families are very mindful about keeping a modest public profile
Then they can go to France and enjoy life
Saw an english speaking guy at a bar trying to pick up chicks  where i live by pouring a bottle of champagne on the floor
The dude almost ended up in a hospital after a group of guys got pissed at his arrogance, and decided that they had consumed enough vodka to sleep a night in the local police station
The bouncers had to escort the guy out of the bar for his own safety
I can understand it somewhat though
Wouldn't you be more prone to flex how far you've come if you grew up poor
And if enough people do that, then it might become the norm, and old money folks find it acceptable too
Just my little hypothesis :)
I wonder if that's what actually happened in most cases, though
A lot of countries known for being poor are *not* known for social mobility
> Danish TV-shows are usually short
That is the way to do it
I mean
when something goes on for 5000 episodes, it's not going to be very good is it
Don't forget "Heartbeat"
In Norway, because of all the fjords, mountains and valleys there are thousands of dialects, some only spoken by a few hundreds or thousands because geography separated them for thousands of years
So yes, there are many dialects I struggle with
It's been times I am not even sure they are speaking to me in Norwegian
There used to be a popular tv show in the 80ies where some local person from a village would say a few sentences and Norwegian dialects experts could guess what village they were from
And they could pin it down within a few kilometers if they were lucky
That is to say, there are so many dialects in Norway, many villages have their own version
People who move to bigger towns and cities usually make their dialects more understandable (I guess because they get tired of being asked "what
"), but many like to keep some of their dialects to signal pride in where they are from
...and when you hear them speak with somebody from home, they completely change their dialect back to the original dialect they grew up with :)
While dialects vary significantly from region to region
I understand pretty much all of them
Some old people with very thick accents might be harder to understand, but they will make themselves understandable
This is a good example of a difficult dialect, I think it is from Nordmøre
I am not really sure, but I think it might be "På dialekten" [
See, I didn't understand any of that
So apparently I find Italian dialects hard to understand too
Depends on where you are
The coast, especially in the south doesn't get as much snow as you'd probably think
Inland regions and up north gets a lot
Where I live, in Trondheim we got our first snow in late October/early November last year, although it didn't stay for very long
Then it came back and stayed on the ground in early December and more or less stayed continuesly until April I think, although a few days it got washed away by the rain
The north pretty much got more snow than ever last year, they had loads way out in May, and they even got snow in June some places
I live in the north and the mountains around are already white
Last year we got snow mid October which lasted until June
Normally it doesn't last that long but there's always snow in winter
Where I'm originally from, a suburb of Oslo, we would also always get snow but some winters, it would be very little
Here it snows from late october to early may
(In Northern-Norway)
Depends a lot on where you live
But where I’m from the first snowfall usually comes in October/November (this usually melts away in a day or two) then from mid/late to early December it stays on he ground until March/April
But as many others points out, there’s definitely less snow now than when I grew up, and the freezing cold ( -25 to -35 degrees) is rarer as well
Where I live it starts snowing around October-November and it usually stops in April but this year it snowed well into May
Here it’s snows from november sometimes late october and then until april, though it’s decreasing how much snow we get
we stilll get a lot of snow, although less than before
but last winter it snowed from November to May
It used to snow in December, but now it usually doesn't happen until mid January
There might be some days where there's a little bit, but it melts the day after or so
Edit: I live in the southeast
South in Norway, specifically Haugesund, it mostly rains  over the winter, but snow isn't "rare". We usally get like 5-10cm, sometimes more, but not every year
It has even happend that there's no snow almost the whole winter but lots in like mach and april
Yeah, we get little snow in general (Bodø) but last year it snowed in May, a lot
I would say though, we get less snow now than before, but with global warming going on, the gulf stream might shut doen so some day er might be like Antarctica
1000000,65 isn't better honestly
Now you have to count the damn zeros
With bigger numbers it gets worse but then again, most of those are written 4

Being an atheist is like preferring Coca Cola over Pepsi, it's very common and extremely unlikely that other people would care about it
I'm a atheist and I have never met anyone outside of internet that have cared what my religious views are
Normal
I think there are more atheists than religious people here
That might not be shown in statistics as many are still member of the church even though they're atheists
Which reminds me, I should probably remove myself as a member of the church
No one cares what you believe
The only religious people i know are my grandparents
They’re more common than theists from my experience, but people are respectful for the most part
As the norm
the imortal rulers of the galaxy
They are viewed as both normal and common
Although I tend to meet more agnostic people than atheists
I live on the south coast, so religious people are very common as well
That's an amazing analogy
Not so sure, most people I know discriminate against Coca Cola drinkers
Edit: also i read somewhere that less than 20% of our population is religions but I can't confirm that
That's sad
Non-judgemental Norwegians are ;)
Pretty sure the most popular drink here is Pepsi Max but I don't actual numbers on it
I wouldn't say they're very prevalent, no
They're mostly known for knocking on doors and handing out their magasine
Interesting that you've heard horror stories about them
I wouldn't call myself young anymore given that I am approaching thirty, but I am certainly young enough to have not experienced how it was like thirty years ago, so you are probably right

Very bizarre indeed
There's a twitter account that pretends to be him
Pretty wholesome [jokes]
>A bit annoying that the shaman can switch the TV channel without the remote control

That is a bit funny actually
(Unless he has dyslexia of course)
In norwegian you only get the sh sound from sk, sj, skj, sl
Does it help that there's absolutely nothing else around
I imagine there's a difference between that and living on a French island in the Caribbean where you're more likely to interact with other countries in the region
That’s super cool
How are people from Curaçao treated
Are they viewed as similar as Dutch people or even those from Aruba
They also did a podcast about "why and how people live in earth's most isolated and extreme settlements" which include St

That's very interesting
I didn't know
Spanish and Russian for the usefulness in travel
Would open up so many new countries and areas I could visit
Finally I would say either Mandarin, Japanese or Arabic
Although I guess Arabic might not be that useful due to all the different dialects and varities, some which are not intelligible from each other
Japan is just an interesting country and Mandarin could be cool just considering u can finally communicate with 1 billion new people
And it would be cool to actually get to understand and learn the culture there
I have no real idea what daily life is like in China
I already speak Norwegian, English, and Spanish
I’d learn French, German, and Mandarin because they are  so common
Spanish would be a logical choice, but I have a weakness for Portuguese
Mandarin would be a snart choice in this day and age, so that
The last one
hmm
Arabic
Oof, this is difficult
I'm a Norwegian translator and would base my choices on work opportunities
I already speak and write English well, but would like to be fluent, i.e. mother-tongue level
The two other ones would be Arabic and Mandarin, I think
Or Spanish
Or Russian
Or Korean
Or I might go for programming languages and make new career alltogether
Norway obviously wasn't a part of the USSR, but in Kirkenes there is a monument that honours the soldiers that fell when the Soviets drove the Nazis away from Finnmark
The statue itself is standard Soviet stuff, a soldier with a gun with a plaque that is in Russian and Norwegian
The monument itself is placed in a bit weird location, but I would oppose removing it, and I don't think anyones planning to do it soon either
The people from Finnmark are so much more pro-Russia/Soviet than the rest of the country, and everyone got pissed there when they weren't allowed to invite Russian delegation for victory day celebration
I don’t really think this counts, but in Svalbard (an archipelago in the North Pole that belongs to Norway) you can find the northernmost Lenin statue in the world
Most Norwegians don’t really care about it, mostly because only about 2,500 people live on Svalbard and about 20% of them are Russians or Ukrainians
The statue is situated in a ghost town and the only ones who lived there before it got abandoned were soviets
Today it’s mostly just a tourist attraction
Personally, I don’t really care either, I just think it’s a cool tourist attraction
[Soviet Liberation Monument in Kirkenes]
(I couldnt find an english version)
Norway hasnt been under any control by the Soviet Union, but it was built to celebrate the Soviet Union’s work in liberating Norway in WWII
I dont think there is any hate towards the statue, its just a Soviet soldier
That's pretty cool
(well, the story, not that he was a POW)
Historic fact
After the war ended German POW in Norway complained they were treated badly while Soviet POW's were ''treated with love and affection'', despite the Germans not giving the Soviets food and using them as slave labour leaving hundreds, if not thousands dead
Of course, Germans had to do pretty horrific stuff too, and several hundred died only due to them being forced to remove mines they had placed themselves a few years earlier by hand
> You should bring your glass back to the bar when you order another drink or when you leave
Fuck, last time in was in an English pub I totally forgot to do that, left our glasses on the table and bailed out of there
Here they usually come and get the glasses themselves
Now I feel guilty ://
I quite like the buying your round concept
Makes it so you all don't have to get up every 20-30 min and flock to the bar like a herd of sheep
Problem here is that people rarely buy more than 3-4 beers in the bar itself because of the prices, most of the drinking is done at home
Also if you're in your early 20's or whatever some places will get suspicious if you want to buy 5 beers at once because they're afraid one of you is underage or something
They're so bloody strict about it here
I wish buying your round was more common here though
Typically Norwegian police is unarmed, but we have had periods where they’ve been armed with hand guns
Usually their weapons are kept in a locker in their vehicles
Not common
I have personally never seen an armed police officer
I see it mentioned but wanted to clarify
In Norway, they keep light and sometimes heavier weapons locked in the car
If they get sent to something that may require weapons the command simply tells them to arm up
You only see armed patrolling police around airports and embassy buildings
Heavily armed isn’t seen that often, except during special occasions or at special places like embassies, but not regularly at airports and train stations etc
The Norwegian police shall as a general rule have their handguns and other firearms locked up in their car or at police stations and have to report in if they feel the need to arm themselves
Although the last years there’s been a temporary arming of the police due to increased threats of terrorism where police officers carry a handgun in their belt, this temporary arming has been continuously prolonged since by Stortinget (the Norwegian Parliament)
This makes the status quo and de facto general rule in Norway today that police officers carry handguns
Also, the officers have to actually call in to get a permit if they feel that they need to arm themselves
Their request might actually be denied if their boss doesn't feel that the mission is dangerous enough
Side note: I have a life long friend who's a police officer, the nicest guy imaginable
He had borrowed something from me, and texted me to see if he could drop by and deliver what he'd borrowed *if there's time during my duty* he added
A few hours later, my doorbell rang, and there stood a fully armed police officer
Even though I knew it was my friend, a jumped for a second when I saw the gun at his hip
It has practically become the new normal that police officers carry handguns to all times, since the period of arming is continually prolonged
I had the same experience, though not Spain
I was like "Why would a normal police officer walk around with a gun on them at all times
That shouldn't be necessary
Unless it's a high risk country like somewhere in the middle east or the US
They send you in
Wow, exciting
What's the worst situation you've had to deal with
I was taught to separate north and south America, and that Australia is a country while Oceania is a continent
A little unrelated question
Where does the devide between north and south america go
For me, the most sensible would be that everything north of the Panama Canal would be North America, but based on what I’ve read it seems like only Mexico, USA and Canada is North America, how does that devide makes sense
Same in Norway
My class were thought 7 “world parts”(verdensdeler): north-America, south-America, Europe, Africa, Antarctica, Asia and Oceania
and 5 continents: America, Africa, Eurasia, Antarctica and Oceania/Australia(a bit of a debate here)
Yeah
Many confuse World Parts with continents, but this is the way it is taught
So if there are two continents, North and South America
Would everything north of the Panama Canal, including the caribbian, be North America
Yes i did Sorry
In more populated areas there are often a combined path for walking and cycling asides more trafficked roads
Cycling on roads with some traffic can be a bit scary, especially if it’s an older and curvy countryside road and you can’t quite know what’s behind next turn or hilltop
Car drivers are notorious for being generally against cyclists here and will often not take any considerations towards you
In the “cities” cycle lanes might exist, but it’s often a bit patchy
The cycling infrastructure in Oslo is improving, but still a joke at large
It used to be quite bad in Oslo, but in 2015 the Green party won the election
I am not a fan of the party, but one job they have been amazing at for the past 5 years is building bike lanes
My family have gatherings during birthdays, christmas and New years eve
We have dinner, desserts and liqour later in the evening
Well, we are a very musical bunch
My uncle (4) is a jazz pianist in Spain and has written an opera that was showed in Madrid (met his wife there, they moved here, but then they moved to Spain) , uncle (3) plays clarinet, piano and guitar, uncle (2) plays guitar, mom is a trained opera singer, but never got to perform as a headliner because my older brother was born with disabilities so she stopped to take care of him
She later on used her musical education as therapy for him and my twin who's also born with disabilities
My dad met my mom in a youth choir that used to tour the whole country
He later quit singing tho, but his brother uncle (1) still sings and used to be an actor in local plays
So yeah, when we all gather, there's bound to be music
A lot of it too
I used to be an actress too, here in my city, until some medical mistakes took that away from me
Anyway, we tend to go all "house band" with music from all genres
My dad btw, I call him a lost hippie, cause he's all about ELP, Asia, Marillion, Focus, Jethro Tull, that type of music
Mom and I share more of Beatles, operas and musicals
So yeah
Full on house band, all genres, mom and I sing while the uncles play, and it's great fun
We try to have reunion with all the extra cousins and outer family
We have relatives in several countries so we try to invite everyone, get a big locale with lots of space
Last time, we had cousins from the US coming, and my mom drew up a massive family tree and filled in how everyone else is related, and for any blank spots, others could fill in
We had games, music and a bunch of awesome
Er det det det er

(That is what it is

Another Guy answers: det er det der er

About the same, just less ä’s.
Same here
Its even weirder when you throw in our dialects, you can get stuff like:
"E d d d e?" - 'is it that [what] that is
in legitimate verbal conversations, and it would be a 100% allowed way to say it
Only twice
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
- Harald Fairhair
- St
Olav Haraldsson
- Henrik Ibsen
- Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson
- Knut Hamsun
- Fridtjof Nansen
- Roald Amundsen
- Edvard Grieg
- Edvard Munch
I might add King Sverre I and Peter Tordenskjold as well, but I might be biased because I'm from Trondheim
Might I also add Snorri Sturluson and Leif Eriksson from our Icelandic friends
Vidkun Quisling, whose name became a synonym to traitor, and perhaps the most infamous man in Norwegian history, should be on this list
Maybe Max Manus, Gunnar Sønsteby and Quisling too
Or are they not historical/as known as i thought
I'd add Einar Gerhardsen
TIL the Danish polymath Piet Hein is descended from a Dutch Piet Hein
Was the first name to spring to my mind so I agree
I don't think most people remember him at all
I figured that the requirement that *everyone* should know about them is a really high bar to clear, even if not interpreted literally
Well, everyone have heard of Snorre, and his Heimskringla is very important to our understanding of early Norwegian history
Look at everyone claiming Charles the Great
No, it's a different person
True, or at least there's no real evidence for him being historical
Neither Snorre nor Leiv Eiriksson should be on this list
They might descend from Norwegians, but both lived in the Icelandic Commonwealth from birth till death (or Greenland in Leiv's case)
It's like if the British should go ahead and claim famous Americans for their list
No, but we had a [Spanish tourist that fell off a cliff] Does that count
That particular incident was actually the very first time anyone fell off that particular cliff
Which is quite extraordinary [when you look at it]
I'm so used to it that I don't think much about it
It's better for expressing complex thoughts and emotions than my native language, which I use more for the daily mundane stuff
yeah, i'd say so
It's a pretty freeform language with shorthand words for a lot of things
THIS
Pronounciation is the hardest word to get right the first try
The place where my school is I believe there's like 2-3 active cases of someone having the virus, so I think it's going to be fine
The stupid stuff is they don't mention what age that person is theyre like "Oh this person is between 18-65 years old". It's kinda infuriating and doesn't help at all
The kids are safe
I'm not worried for myself either, even though I'm a teacher
But I'm worried about my mother, who has a problem with her lungs
I haven't seen much of her since march, and I fear I won't be able to see her for maybe another 6 months because I may bring the virus to her
Yes, school reopened in May and that went well
My kids aren't in school yet, but they're both back in preschool/kindergarten and we feel safe
Cases seem to be rising slightly after people returned from summer vacation though, so we'll see
I feel very safe
I trust that the government will close all schools again if necessary
Our King, Harald V, has a great sense of humor
[One Example:]
him and the queen talking about some kind of station:
King: wasn’t the station named after you
Queen: No, it’s called Troll
King: Yes, exactly
"There was a moose in the engine"
-The *rally driver* ~~can't remember the name of~~ Petter Solberg, who's embarassingly bad at English
I’m guessing Petter Solberg
wait she actually did that
Even I didn’t know lol
That's the guy
She’s chill
I'd say there's a bit of prejudice
I'm not sure if it's the mixup with Romani or just prejudice based on a small amount of people from there - truck drivers from Romania or nearby countries that behave like idiots and endanger people by flouting safety laws, for example
Or if the more prejudiced people actually think Romanians steal or whatever
Then there's the corruption thing, but as far as I can tell, that one is actually bang on the money, unfortunately
Gypsies, corruption, poverty, thieving immigrants
I know some lovely Romanians (who married Norwegians, hence why I know them)
But Romania as a whole is probably by most seen as very poor, and the home of all the Gyspys coming here every summer
I remember it because I thought it was extremely funny back then
And it still is, so no shame in making the same joke again
Probably [Nidaros Cathedral] [.] the northernmost gothic cathedral in the world
Other than that we have the [Old Town Bridge] Fortress] and [the Monk's Islet]
Trondheim has the worlds northernmost proper medieval cathedral
It’s also the largest in scandinavia
We have a few buildings from before World War 2 and like a very tall plastic Santa overlooking the fjord
Idk if we'd really call those landmarks though
Well, rather disappointingly, our word for hammer is hammer
The pronunciation is not that different either from English
Kind of makes sense as the word is Germanic/Old norse
It's hammer in Norwegian too
Main difference in pronounciation is the 'a' is pornounced like it is car
I think we have a winner
In the west we have the sharpest of Rs, so I'd argue that a western Norwegian saying "hammar" is at least as badass
I live paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford to save anything
Currently a student though, with very limited income
Some save to buy a future home
No one saves for a rainy day
> Some could save a lot, but they spend everything
That is 80% of the Norwegian population right there
As a student, 40h a week is spent studying
I also work 40%.
with the monthly student loan payment of €850, about €20 an hour at work
after paying rent, Internet, cellphone, insurances, gas
yeah there’s barely any left
If you work full-time in a proper job, however, you should of course be able to save up too
It's our time to use the term *those southerners* for everyone, even those not in the South
Seeing as we are perhaps the country in europe with the largest gap between climate extremes from north to south (polar bears and arctic ice sheet vs temperate beaches) i’d say we gucci
The northerners will see big culture changes
No more emptyness, nature, cold weather
Some will like it, some won't.
The southerners will start to feel isolated, become bored more easily and starve more, since there's less options in terms of food in the north
They'll also wear more clothes than what they're used to
Housing in Oslo would become very cheap, as there would be thousands empty
SØRINGA
Also we would have the majority of Saami people living up north and not around Oslo
lingustic-layered cake : )
If we flip the country's population upside-down
The islanders would be thrown in the ocean
Oh wow, I didn't even think about that
My professor was insulted when I called him nordlending
He's from Finnmark
So I just told him not to call me søring
Worked like a charm
Where are we splitting
Right above Trondheim
No, just ocean
Yep
I think that's the place
yeah, holy shit
there would be an immense housing crisis as there’s not even close to enough houses up north nor enough people in the south
We’d all freeze to death long before that’s an issue
Or be eaten alive by mosquitoes, depending on the season
Meanwhile, the former northerners who have been relocated to Oslo all get hit by streetcars in the first week or two
They'd prolly knit sweaters for them and carry them around in handbags
Probably cause nobody north of Trondheim knows how to drive one
Norway is a very nature filled area (people hike a lot and stuff) so people are like reasonably ok with it in general
It's only when people are drunk that I really see them peeing on the city
On the other hand, in my city Bergen, there are so few public toilets (most of them are in malls/businesses and you have to pay for the private mall ones unless they are further out of the city)
So on days when the malls etc are closed and/or people are at locations too far to walk just to piss (like a park), then they try to piss discretely where they can (like bushes)
This applies for women too
Most people here also fully understand due to how shitty our city is with public toilets
Can't really complain about something with such a bad solution
Don't know that much for other cities though
I think they have more public toilets
Norway - Arrestable offence, but police generally don't patrol looking for public pissers
It isn't a large problem, as people are usually bright enough to not be overt about it
I know in USA you can become a sex offender (pedophile) charges and get screwed for life
When studying in USA many international students were warned of this
Then I learned it’s actually quite common
Can’t say much for Norway/Denmark
Honk honk honk
No, I prefer them soft
I always cook pasta longer than it says on the package
*reading though all the comments from the Italians
A coworker brought some delicious looking pasta leftovers for her lunch the other day
She heated it in the microwave, then
cut it into small pices
I damn near told her off
I'm curious, how is firm pasta healthier than soft pasta
I know, right
Cutting (or breaking) spaghetti is not acceptable
When I eat my home cooked pasta, I over eat everytime regardless of how well it's cooked
Yeah, it's kinda acceptable for kids
But not for 50 year old grown women
Beer prices
If I tell you to expect $14 USD for a single beer (*at bars, in stores you can get it conciderably cheaper*), I am not exaggerating
Is this because of old plumbing
I hope this isn't true in all of Greece, or I may have messed up a hotel on Korfu/Kerkyra
Funny guy
Cheapest is €2
6 or so, and the fancy stuff is higher (twice or more)
For 0
3liters
For instance, 0
33l Duvel is €5
Haha, yeah
I suppose you guys have a wider range of prices than we do
I've heard horror stories about some of your largest cities that makes it seem expensive from even our point of view
Relative to what
Our income
But probably to that of a few countries income
Imagine the nut shots back in the day
I’d have to wear a cup (athletic support) just to protect my baby makers
They largely only have pilsners though, so I can understand why
If it was a dutch guy on the other hand
By making sure everyone can afford it
Historically we have a pretty strong brewing tradition
In fact, 1000 years ago every farm was required by law to brew their own
A farm that abstained 3 years in a row would get fined (no idea how strongly or fairly this law was practiced though)
Moonshine also has a solid place in our culture although it's died off quickly over the past few decades
In modern times, we mostly shrug it off because we can afford it
A bottle of wine can quickly be priced at €85-350 at a restaurant
A glass is typically €8
5 to €13
So it's all similar
In stores you will get 1
5L coke for 2-3€, at restaurants it's 3-6€ for 0
3-0
5L (with a bit larger variance depending on quality restaurant)
You know, I've thought about that a few times
restaurants seem to have extremely high wine prices, whereas wine bought at the liquor store is pretty cheap with $9 for the cheapest
I've heard of spelling bees in the US, but I don't think we've got them in Norway/Norwegian
I know of the concept, cause it seems so often portrayed in american movies/tv-shows
I've never heard of a similar concept here, even though we also don't spell words the way we say them
Maybe not on the same level as English, but we have quite a few loan words that are spelled completely different than what we would say
Restaurant for instance, if spelled in Norwegian, we would probably write "resturang". Many Norwegian words are also said in a various different ways, and we have often more than one correct way to spell something due to our two written languages
I have only seen spelling bees in American movies
Never heard of one in Norway
Nope
Spelling Norwegian words is ridiculously easy
The younger the language, the easier it is to spell
Estonian for instance is younger than Norwegian, and even more easy to spell
English is a old language, so spelling is not always intuitive
We also have a very not-kingly king
He’s pretty cool
Norway: In their 20, no
In the 30's people start hinting
But being 35 and single is perfectly accepted in our society
Oslo: Every generic capital city stereotype
Bærum (Area outside of Oslo): Rich spolied kids
Daddy pays for everything
Agder (South of Norway): Relaxed, most likely Christians
Bergen: They only care about Bergen and not the rest of Norway
Obnoxiois and speaks too much
Møre (North-west): Greedy and harsh with spending
Inland regions: All farmers
Hates wolves and votes for Senterpartiet (one of several political parties in Norway)
Trønderlag (middle of the country): If from outside of Trondhein they love karsk (alcohol+coffee)
If from Trondheim the love karsk and Rosenborg (football team)
Also they all have mustaches
The north: Loves fish, swears constantly
Can be a bit blunt
All the way north (Finmark): Either reindeer herders or fishermen
Alcohol and swearwords
Svalbard: No people, only polar bears
From a central Norwegian perspective based on what I've heard expressed:
* **Far North:** - Depressing but beautiful area with Norwegians clinging to life in dying fishing villages and sami people herding reindeer
Death by mosquitoes in summer
* **Nordland:** - Often stubborn people who think they are special for living on the Arctic Circle
* **Trøndelag:** - The Holy land, objectively the best place to live according to locals
* **Namdalen:** - The easily forgettable part
* **Namsos:** - Wants to be Nashville after creating a couple musicians
* **Steinkjer:** - Calls themselves "the IT-city". Can only assume it's a joke
* **Innhered:** - Biggest collection of farmers north of Dovre
Loves moonshine and far left radical music
* **Stjørdal:** - Suburb of Trondheim, known for having Tronheim's airport
* **South:** - *"The crow flies upside down here so she doesn't have to look at it"* - Grandfather
* **Røros:** - Hasn't modernised their architecture since the mines ran dry
* **Trondheim:** - Ruins the rest of the country's perception of Trønders
Loves their leather vests and moustaches
* **Fosen:** - Where people get cabins to go fishing
Rumours of a local population
Also the air force
* **Jamtland:** - Swedish-occupied forests and summer homes
* **Inland east:** - Nice lads
Makes some country music, otherwise not much
* **Coastal/urban east:** - Right-Wing rich spoiled EU-supporters who don't know about real life
* **The south:** - Can't pronounce their P, T, R and Ks
Enthusiastic Christians
* **South-West:** - Stavanger and Bergen, only relevant if you work with oil or like football rivalries
* **North-West:** - Called Møre (even Fjordane)
Christians, might be greedy
Trøndelag: Alcoholics and pedophiles*
Western Oslo: Rich, arrogant fucks
Eastern Oslo: Immigrants and crime
Østfold: Cars, smoking, funny accent
Hedmark: Inbred farmers
Oppland: Farmers
no you're thinking about the thing with the straight bananas
In Norway is not necessarily easy, depending on where you live
I grew up close to Sweden though and we went there once or twice a month I'd say for shopping
Mostly food and drinks but also other stuff
It's hard to explain the "feeling", it's just very natural
Scandinavia especially is just very socially and politically connected
Going over there is kinda just like driving a couple hours to see your uncle or something
Pretty chill, cheap alcohol and sugar is just an hour away
Its nice
We only drive for 30 min, then sit on a ferry for a couple of hours, and in Denmark we are
Since most of the time is spent sitting drinking coffee on a ferry it doesn't really feel like travelling at all
A great way to start your summer holiday
Grew up near the finnish and russian borders, it became very routine
It is really great for road trips
As a vacation you can just get in your car and drive and visit one or more countries every day
Different cultures, food and languages
And especially good nowadays when there are no border crossings, euro is a common currency and you can use your mobile phone everywhere at no extra cost
...God I miss travelling :)
Before covid, it was very common for us to go to sweden to buy alcohol and groceries because it's much cheaper
200km really isn’t that far though
My wool boots
I have a pair of traditional wool boots (Nesnalobben) that I use nearly every day during winter
They’re made of felted wool, and aren’t waterproof at all, but who needs waterproof boots when it’s -20°C outside
You don’t take them indoor, because the snow on them would melt and the shoes get wet
You take them off outside and leave them there until next time you step out
They might not be common for the everyday Norwegian, as most modern people don’t use hardcore traditional stuff, but they’re very common to me
Warm as fuck
Some days I can’t even wear wool socks in them, as it simply gets too hot
ETA [Here’s what the shoe look like] Thought I could provide a link in the original comment so y’all don’t have to read through every single comment
Putting [woollen underwear] on the younger children starting in October at the latest, and not stop doing so until March, at the earliest
Cotton is only used when they get older, plus in the warmer part of the year
I love those
I actually got mine from my aunt a couple of years ago and couldn't understand how I hadn't worn them before that
Those types of boots is one of the few reasons I wish I lived in a colder part of Norway
Thank you for posting
I know exactly what to get for my birthday money
It's actually warm here today, only - 14c!
Thanks for making Norwegians happy by mentioning our only invention, the cheese slicer ;) Just want to point out that on softer cheeses, you use the [Norwegian type cheese slicer without the flat part] The flat "tongue" part is what messes up the softer cheeses
And to be honest, the slicer type without the flat part works perfect on all cheeses and is a better cheese slicer IMO
The only difference is the cheese slice after cutting is left on the cheese, not on the cheese slicer
You can get the Norwegian type with the flat part cut short though
It works better with the softer cheeses
Similar thing here, you get to keep the AG after service
Spanish people, you are just spoiled with sun and warmth :) In Norway we want every bit of light and warmth into our houses
But to be honest, I have rented apartments in Spain with these shutters and I have thought this must be kinda a bad neighbourhood and that those things were for home safety
They aren't uncommon north of the arctic circle since the sun is up all summer
I remember being a kid, the kicksled was fine for crossing lakes but also on paved city roads before they started to use salt
My first taste of freedom
Also, my neighbor had one with a engine, [very similar to this]
In Norway, we call them «spark», meaning kick
When I was a kid, we used to put a lot of them together, and make a train of them
We went pretty fast, and had no control over the stearing
It is a miracle that we survived the 70s. :)
In Tromsø, in the north, people in the same neighbourhoods sometimes have what they call «Sparkiade», where they all meet with their kicksleds, and «travel» from house to house
In one house, they are served an appetizer, in another house they are served drinks, in another they are served dinner, etc
I have been to Sweden and Finland a lot, yet I have almost never seen one there, in Norway these seem to be much more common, though I might have not visited the right cities
Grew up using that, it is called a spark (kick) in Norwegian
But that was before they started salting roads
They only used gravel and sand on slippery roads and pavements back then, so we could just kick through those parts of the roads with sparks flying :) If it was late winter and snow had melted before freezing again, it was allmost impossible to walk because of the ice, but perfect to use the spark
I still remember the feeling of steering it by bending the handles hard to one side and standing on one skid in sharp turns <3
We had separate hot and cold taps - until the war ended and the mixer tap was invented
Visiting the UK, I have never understood how you deal with separate taps
When you wash your hands, do you first scold your hands in the hot water killing all bacteria, then ease the swelling with the cold water
tf is a sink scraper
Here in Norway, we just drink
Aromat is great for everything, although it is mostly salt and MSG
Not quite, [they look like this] I have the tall black model, but the low gray one is the original traditional one
Oooh
That webshop has lots of nice things
Google translator translates "boots" into "blankets", and "slippers" into "drawers". Which is kind of funny
But since there are photos it just adds charm to the shopping experience
(Although I didn't check if they ship to Norway)
Haha, no worries
Most of traditional Norwegian clothing has never been mass produced
Most sweaters and such have been made by your average grandma (well, yes and no, but you might get what I mean haha)
Dale of Norway is probably the “only” brand that has taken traditional knitwear into the bigger scale, as far as I know
I’ll happily stand corrected if anyone else knows
On the top of my head, Amundsen makes some vintage looking outerwear, and brands such as Kari Traa makes wool baselayers with Norwegian inspired patterns on it
>  I don't think I'd need boots like yours, but are there other brands or types of Norwegian clothing and outerwear which you'd recommend, which are also that type of traditional thing
Another Norwegian here
For specific garments, there's something called selbuvotter (Selbu mittens), which are really traditonal
They look like this: [
Wool doesn’t really get *cold*, so no, not really
By the time your sock stops being warm, your shoe is heated back up
Cool
Get two sizes bigger than your normal size, they don’t have a left/right so you need some extra room (most websites who sell them state this I believe, just to make sure)
Dry them up and store them
You don’t wear them when the snow melts because it’s far too warm by then anyways haha
The boot itself isn’t cold, just the air inside it
Your wool sock is a nice and toasty foot temperature, so when you put your warm foot in, most of the cold air is pushed out :)
I usually just put my buns on top of the toaster without that fancy grid
But just for a short time
Depends on the house though
My parents house don't need anything like it, it is incredible insulating
Hot in the winter and cold in the summer
But my house now definitely needs some outside sun shading
Thin walls and big windows kinda sucks
Is it the same as an air fryer
Sorry to rain on your parade here incredibleflipflop, but keeping your shoes outside so the snow on them never melt, seems to me something you like to do
It is not something you have to do
Unless you live your life stomping through fresh snow every day, it seems easier to brush off the snow before going indoors
And if not, the shoes will dry like any other shoes without being ruined
I grew up using the Nesnalobben, but the [traditional short one] (non-Norweigans, don't click the link, it is not the stylish modern one, but the ugly original one)
That wool is tough and can stand rough use, we didn't even bother to brush off snow and those shoes were good for several winters
If any problem it is these are too warm winter shoes
I live in Norway and I can't even wear them
Now it's been cold enough for two weeks, but the next time its cold enough might be 5 years from now
So I am resisting the urge to buy boots like this, as they are rather pricy for so little use
I'm struggling to imagine how you fuck up with a cheese slicer
Looks very similar indeed
Yeah of course
:) Snow is only wet when it melts
The snow might stick to the wool, but since all the warmth is inside the shoe and not on the outside, the snow that sticks to the shoe stay perfectly frozen
I know plenty of people who leave them outdoor, so it’s not just my parade you’re raining on, haha
We often go outside every 3-4h throughout the day, and do indeed have quite a lot of snow
I brush off the worst snow before I leave them be, but taking them indoor still makes them moist and moisture = cold
Nothing that is considered traditional - you have the Bunad but that’s our national costume, crazy expensive and made of wool haha
Summer outfit is more of a modern thing
It's called Selburose (Selbu rose), based on where it comes from
Coffee enema
I would argue otherwise
The metal ones are the best
The plastic slicers get blunt fast and you will have a hard time cutting anything but a big hard cheese, even then they will create thick slices
I do too, but let's be honest
We don't have a Finnish sink scraper
(Being totally honest, I still don't understand the sink scraper
Do they leave the sink scraper at the bottom of the sink collecting the peeled bits or do they actually scrape the sink with that plastic thing
Yes, that’s it
So when it’s around 5°C to -5°C I don’t wear them
The snow tends to be not as dry when it’s warm, but then again it’s simply too warm outside for those shoes anyways
Why am I not surprised fish-socks are a thing in Iceland
no, thanks
Hivemc
eu i think the ip is, its a minigames server
Sad how all good servers are ruined by US ping
You should check out the server the spiffing brit made
He makes on it
It depends, it is probably unplayable for people using wifi in countries with bad internet
In which case you have to play eu servers
I used to have shitty wifi internet and playing on hypixel was shit, but when i got fiber it was good to play on
High speed rail
I live in Trondheim which is almost 8 hours away by train to Oslo
With high speed rail that time could be more than halved
When taking into consideration the trip to the airport and back + checking in and waiting + 1 hour flight, it would make the two alternatives close in total travel time, with the added benefit of trains just being more comfortable and you didn't have to stress about switching modes of travel for the entire trip
The nature is a bit more
challenging than other places, but if we can build a highway under and over fjords in the west, we should be able to construct high speed rail between the largest cities
Raise taxes, I don't care as long as I get my high speed rail
Fresh locally produced vegetables all year around
(Current season is May - September)
I agree with you
This is where northern Europe is behind
My neighbour has one
He grew up in Iran
I agree
It should be a no-brainer but for some reason we just goootta build those highways in the middle of nowhere that much fewer people will use instead
From Oslo I’d love high speed to Bergen, Trondheim, Stockholm (there is a private initiative to get this going) and Gøteborg
This
I would also love cheaper train tickets
A seven hour train ride from Oslo to Bergen costs almost the same as travelling by plane (45 mins)
> Prison for tax evasion
What happens now
Are they given a fine
> My mum is British and dad is Italian and there is a stark difference in the knowledge of cooking between both countries
Very interesting combination
One question; are wealthy Brits more likely to make food from scratch
It’s also way too easy to fire people in the US
Tourists have no reason to visit Estonian residential areas though
And who cares anyways when you have the prettiest capital in Europe
I am really curious about how the topic of bidet came up in a conversation with a neighbor
Are you guys friends or something
Not really a no-brainer because of the huge costs and questionable profitability
I do think it's a good idea though
If you're building high speed rail from Oslo to Bergen I think Haukelibanen is the best alternative
It is even more expensive, but it also connects to Haugesund and Stavanger
You cannot really compare high speed rail and regular roads
For high speed rails to work, you need a flat landscape
Well, unfortunately for us, our topography is terrible for high speed rail way
It becomes seriously expensive
That is the one thing that surprised me about Berlin when visiting last time
I haven't had cash in years, I only use my phone or card to pay touchless everywhere in Norway, but Berlin was surprisingly still very much a cash based society
I don't know why, but I thought Germany would have been quick to implement technology that is not really even new anymore
> *stares in free public bathroom* man this is something about europe I just dont understand
*stares at my mail box which has never seen a hospital bill (in spite of my son having been in hospital about 10 times the last couple of years, including 9 ambulances and 1 ambulance helicopter)
[Bergen] and [Trondheim] are nice
Which Finnish cities are most pleasing to the eye, in your opinion
Friends with my husband, so he has used his bathroom
Is there any traction to get high speed from Gøteborg to København
I know it is fairly quick already, but a proper high speed rail down there would be incredible even if Oslo-Gøteborg never happens
It’s not a huge cost compared to other ludicrous highways and roads we are building
Roads are not exactly profitable either
It’s just a matter of priorities
It’s not like the highways that are under works can be built with too much variation in height either
I am fully aware the topography makes it expensive
But it’s almost the same thing with highways, they too need to be built fairly flat, and rail is actually cheaper to build than highways in built road/rail pr
kilometre
Besides, most of (if not all) the proposed high speed  routes would be profitable from a cost-benefit standpoint, which is is not something you can say about a lot of infrastructure projects in the country, since we seem to have a need for catering to areas with low populations instead of building infrastructure that will benefit the most people
That’s all I’m saying
Much of the area between Oslo and Trondheim is pretty flat if you go through Østerdalen
And Oslo to Stavanger can also be made relatively flat if you follow the coastline
Oslo to Bergen is a lost cause though, unless we tunnel through the entirety of Hardangervidda, but it could perhaps go Oslo - Stavanger - Bergen
Norway and Switzerland are quite similar when it comes to cost of healthcare per capita (combining taxes and private cost)
And we don't see it as expensive
So that is interesting
I think I saw a report that the most feasible route would be through Hallingdal through Hemsedal
That route doesn’t have any extreme steep parts, but still would need to be built up a lot along the valleys
Edit: Might not be Hemsedal, probably through Geilo and Finse I’d imagine
Wonderful response, kiitos
Isn't the problem on the western side though
Yeah probably
I’m more familiar with the route on the eastern side, I’d imagine finding a good route along the fjords is difficult
Whenever people try to build something in the city centre a dead horse or a mug from the viking era is dug up, and progress stops for 5 years
Archeologists have to dig the whole construction site up with a toothbrush before you can keep going
Old vitnes in Norway have basically all burned down and been re-built at least 10 times, so you cannot really notice that a city is really old
Also the infrastructure gets redone a lot
But I would say in general Bergen is probably the most noticeable old city maybe
It has a lot of narrow roads and instead of asfalt there are bricks
The thought of calling houses from 1900-1920 historic homes is incredible to me ;) In Europe, that would be considered a regular home
That said, living in a house built in early 1200s sound really old for me as a Norwegian
I can't think of much more than some stave churches being that old in Norway
Hehe, most of the *homes* in my area are from 1920 at the latest (and most are from the first half of the 1800s)
I live in a building from 1929 and it's very modern compared to most of the other ones here
But I'd also be blown away on a daily basis if I lived in a house from the 1200s. There's a church nearby from around then though
100 years is the same in Norway and Netherlands
I am not saying a 100 year old  house would be considered a new house
I am saying it would not be historic
There are 100 year old buildings everywhere
Not the other candidate as much as the other side of the political spectrum
For example, I won't vote for a party which will aid our right wing parties in forming a government
The Greens, which I would normally support, have been unclear on this point, so I won't vote for them until they guarantee they won't support the right
The reason for this is that I believe keeping unions and workers' rights strong (and companies under control) is another essential part of trying to keep the planet sustainable in the long run
The more power and freedom companies get, the more the planet will suffer for it
Yes
In Norway we don’t really vote for the person in the party as much as we do the party itself
Now this is not to say that the leader of the party doesn’t affect wether or not someone will vote for them, but that is usually not the main reason why they are voting for the party
If anything, it's the opposite
People don't vote for a party if they dislike the leader
Like what happened with Venstre
AP is also struggling partially because of a weak leader who doesn't connect with the party's traditional voter base
Luckily our political system means that we're not constantly dominated by only for instance two parties or leaders like the US and UK, so we have a lot more diversity when it comes to our political parties and candidates
Unfortunately, we do tend to have a few "career" politicians, but yeah, at least politics in itself is more accessible to the common people here in Norway
You are correct
Although I was more thinking of it as compared to the US system
Where if the president candidate isn’t this perfect family man with a wife who supports them, then they won’t win
But yeah Støre and Grande has lost a lot of support for their parties because of their own issues
Julebukk
("Christmas-goat") Similar to trick or treat but it's done between Chistmas Day and New Year, and no one threathens you with tricks
The Children dress up, ring the door bell, sing a Christmas song, and get some candy
Sadly trick or treat is taking over, and I find that rather sad
Did trick or treat on Halloween take over
Seems like much of northern Europe had a similar tradition
In Norway children dress up as barn gnomes, Santas, or whatever they like
They sing a Christmas carol and get candy
Sadly Halloween trick or treat is taking over
Don't know about sex but I feel it's the same in Norway when it comes to nudity
I'm convinced we had more nudity on TV in the 90s  children's show than now
Well
I watch TV with my kid every day, and I'm sure there is nothing now
But I also think the little nudity that I saw when I was a kid was swedish anyway
It was the kinda natural innocent skinny dipping or putting on clothes in the morning, not a point in the story, just normal life
I must say though, seeing a naked kid on TV now would disgust me
Here it's sadly growing
At the same time as the Julebukk tradition is dying (dressed up kids going door to door singing Christmas carols, getting candy as a reward)
> Maybe it's a fad
No, it's actually been a tradition for hundreds of years
Used to be a thing in all of Scandinavia and Estonia, but now I beleive the tradition is only alive in Norway
Julebukk has been around for so long
Halloween is a tradition imported by people with commerical interests
Yes
I do hope so
Ah ok, no problem
I just drive normally
If there comes a vehicle in the opposite direction and we can't both fit, then one of us will reverse to a wider part of the road
Same here
Especially at night when you can see the other cars headlights long before you see the car, it's easy
Just slow down before sharp turns and if you meet someone and everything is going to be OK
"One of you" being whoever isn't driving the Toyota Yaris
The biggest reason for narrow roads in Norway is because expanding into two lanes would require you to either carve into a mountain, or fill in a fjord
Usually roads like that have meeting areas spaced out every so often, so you usually don't have to back up very far
Like this would be an example of a road like that, but it's obviously not always this extreme:
Probably morning mood or hall of the Mountain king
"En skål for Norge, kjempers fødeland" ( cheers for Norway, birthplace of giants)
Came here to say Peer Gynt Suite by Grieg; this is good enough
Heh, and here I was thinking [Bønda ifra nord]
I'm such an uncultured swine
Personally, as I've grown up in the west, it's Nordmannen (the Norwegian) by Ivar Aasen that resonates the most with the "nationalist" in my soul
Especially the part about longing for a warmer place in the middle of winter
I didn't believe Morning mood was from a Norwegian composer either, I mean, the song was used in Warner Brothers cartoons
I think i was teenager when i found out about Edvard Grieg
What's referred to as eastern Norway (The part where Oslo is ) is much further west than the northern part towards Russia
Not too weird maybe but I couldn't of any more
Most of our place names have something to do with physical features in nature
I have one: Nesbyen, that translates to "the city on the headlands", is a village far from the ocean, in a narrow valley smack in the middle of the country
According to this, it can apparently also refer to inland features
Same
That's why we haven't even joined
We want autonomy, not to have the bigger European countries rule us like a satellite state
We're only five million people and would barely have a say in anything
The children go to bed early, and get enough sleep
(We never have a problem getting them up in the morning)
And we eat homemade dinner together every day
The traditional standard in Norway has been to work from 8 to 15-16, including your 30 minutes lunch break which normally is eating your damn sandwich by your desk
Then you go home and have dinner, watch tv or whatever and go to sleep
Rinse and repeat
Work times and life to work balance have shifted to something more variable and flexible with different branches, requirements and different ways of life
Personally I don’t get how many people get time to everything anymore, free time activities, gym, reading and watching Netflix, besides job and sleep
Smartphones and laptops have whisked away a lot of the lines between work and free time in many fields, when you’re already working long hours and might have to catch up and be connected all the time that can easily mean you’re basically working around the clock
Which means less free time and less time for sleep again
Executives and highly educated people are enjoying flexi time at work, with 20-30 weekly hours
Much time for high quality food, recreational activities and sleep
Middle class are often working at all hours of the day, shift
With kids, debt and recreational activities there really is limited time to sleep
Food is often selected based primarily on price
Lower class here is a social experiment at this time
If you dont want to/cannot work, no problem, Norwegian government gives everyone about the same as minimum wage simply for existing
Then you have ample time to sleep, eat right and enjoy life in general
> I work full-time,
In some countries that might mean working 70 hours a week
So I think one of the advantages we have in Europe is a good size working week, and strong worker's laws preventing a huge amount of over-time
> But we're the best at working part-time
I didn't know
That is interesting
Today basically every Norwegian family eats taco every Friday
10 years ago nobody had ever even heard about tacos
We have taco Friday (fredagstaco)
A huge amount of people eat tacos on Fridays here for some reason
This sound like a "light" version of the Norwegian [russ]
Yeah, last decade
More like taco bell/texmex style
Supposedly we eat more than you per capita
Not exactly a city but Barentsburg is definitely the most foreign town in Norway, since it's literally a Russian town in Norway
I was thinking about Barentsburg too, but very few Norwegians get to see it
Something on Greenland, like Nuuk, might seem quite foreign to the average Dane
As far as I know, there are two: there's another one in Pyramiden, another old Soviet mining town in Norway (also in Svalbard, a bit further north from Longyearbyen and Barentsburg) that has since been abandoned, except for a handful of people working with tourism there
The western part of Sweden and the eastern part of Norway are very similair
Berlin has got the football team at least
I demand everyone speak english but they have to do it with a scandinavian accent like they do in vikings, the last kingdom and all the best detective drama shows
Floki knows best
Klingon
Pro: seems welcoming to extraterrestrials
Cons: nerdy, difficult
Shouldn't.
Vocabulary is too limited in comparison to, say, English
Why it shouldn’t
We aren’t a part of the EU
Norway is the only country where it is spoken and teached, so it is a very small and unimportant language that only a few people speak
There are way better canditates like French or German but the best is probably to stay with English since it so universal
Because [we got ÆØÅ!]
Holy
Fuck
So many Umlauts
Yeah kind of, but the differences between our two written standards is larger
Even within one written standard, you will sometimes find that there are more than one accepted form of writing
For example boka/boken, bro/bru, frem/fram are all accepted *within the same written standard
* Same thing with the other written  standard, for example de/dokker (this is relatively new) and tenke/tenkje are allowed
So I actually think those word examples you gave fit better here
For the two different written standards, there is a lot more difference, both words and conjugation can differ
Of course there are also many similarities
I guess it can be compared to the British vs American differences like learnt/learned, lift/elevator, just that we have more of it
As soon as you look at the text you know which one it’s written in, unless you get “lucky” with the first sentence or two that you look at
For example
Jeg har vært der en gang
Eg har vore der ein gong (/gang
Øv cårs
I think most nouns are the same, except masculine/feminine is way stricter in nynorsk, whereas in bokmål you could write most as masculine without issue
Neuter nouns are mostly the same core, with different endings
The biggest difference in my opinion are the "structural" words, such as "not", "I", "to/from".. Words that are in every sentence, but where the difference is very clear between the standards
Not sure this is much of a mistake but we let the black death in
This weakened our country and we lost our independence shortly thereafter, which we wouldn't regain until 1905
Finding America, live there for a few years, and then just leave again
Some king in the 1300s went on a horse ride
He fell off, died, and so 600 years under foreign rule began
What about the oil/Volvo deal
Was there any way we could have avoided that though
Virtually the whole of Europe, bar some areas in Poland and some barricaded cities was affected
Seeing as the plague spread here due to a rat on a ship maybe we should have stopped all trade but then again that would probably fucked us over too, and wasn't seen as worth it at the time
I think the plague was inevitable either way
Was thinking the same
We also lost a bunch of land to the danes in the process, including Greenland
Which outta become quite valuable in the future
Well, the Bergensers did
I think we could have stood a chance or at least minimised the impact
We could have closed our borders and the cold climate could have helped us

edit: i should also point out that i come from an island by the sea, and such lower temperatures feel much colder than they really are, so i would probably only consider it chilly if it was -12 and i was inland
the humid air and winds make the cold feel alot colder
cold would probably be -15 and lower at that point

So if it's 10 degrees you walk out your door, realize it's 10 degrees colder than inside, and think "wow, it's hot today"?
Yes, 8°C in January is mild, even warm
In July it's freezing
5° on a sunny day in Easter, means enjoying a beer, shirtless after skiing
In September 5° means it's time to break out the winter jacket
And you call yourself Norwegian
Same here
I was born in the wrong place
Oh you're one of *those*.
It sucks balls (63°N)
I just stay inside most of winter
I live at 60
It's boring more than anything else
I would love for the sun still to be up when going home from work
Lived at 69 degrees north my entire life, I'm used to it by now
The only real challenge with it for me is that navigating in the wilderness if you're heading to a cabin becomes more difficult, because you only have a very narrow timeframe to have any kind of daylight and it's much more difficult to tell your location if it's dark
It might be bad if you've never experienced it, but it's made up for by the midnight sun in the summer, at least for me
Also, the first time you see the sun again in january is magical
69° (nice) here
The sun doesn't rise above the horizon anymore, and won't until late January
It's just a fact of life
You just suck it up, really
I live at 60 degrees north, and I actually prefer it
Winter is my favourite time of the year
Especially when it's really cold and we have lots of snow
I take a spoon of cod liver oil every day which has lots of vitamin D, so that might help
My husband is from France and he uses an artificial light
He can get really grumpy without it
To be fair, it's not so bad really
Only issue is, snow is rarer now, or at least it seems to be the case
No snow means less light in general during winter
thats the hard part
I lived in Finnsnes (northern Norway) from birth to 6 years old
The winter was dark
It was almost completely dark 24/7 and it never got dark during the summer
My mom is from Ålesund (where we live now) And she got used to the dark winters while living in the north
It's really not bad at all
If you are happy, have a good family and great friends, that's all the light you need
Vitamin pills are needed though
Nightfall isn't as sudden up north, so it does take a good while after sunset for the sky to darken
It's 14:20 here, now
Sunset is in ten minutes, but the sky is gonna turn blue through black over the course of the next 2-3 hours
It's always been part of life to me, so I don't really "deal with it" as such, but a few methods to stave off depression and lethargy could be vitamin D supplements, either through multivitamins or fish oil, and a strong blue light to trick your brain into thinking you're seeing more daylight than you actually do
I live 71°N, and I rarely see the sun, but to be honest I don't really see the sun the rest of the year anways cause I'm inside most of the time
I'm too busy to notice it, to be honest
It sucks, but you get used to it
The most depressing period is really mid-late november, when it just gets dark earlier and earlier
December is better, even though its darker, simply because of all the christmas lights and decorations which gives everything a much more cozy vibe
Then in January it finally starts getting brighter again and in February we're pretty much back to being OK
i live at about 60
you just gotta deal with it, you get a short amount of sunlight each day, and that time is usually spent at work or in class
so we usually just stay inside most of the winter, eat alot of fish for that sweet vitamin D. when you grow up with it you don’t really think about it that much tbh
the winters become dreadful after awhile though and you can’t wait for spring and summer, but that just makes it alot sweeter when that time comes
My needs for socializing decrease in the winter while it increases in the summer
So much that its difficult to fulfill my needs during that time which leads to a sence of loneliness
In the winter the need is less, so its easier to fulfill
Hence I feel less lonely in the winter
Other people also feel like this
Same, I just have to remember to always bring my reflective band things so cars can see me in the dark
I don't know, it's more fun to get wasted under the midnight sun
It helps
My son and husband both use one, and itt does wonders for their mood
Yeah, i clearly notice that i have a lack of energy and motivation
Going to work when its dark, going home when its dark
Always cold and raining almost every day, as it has been this fall, its not that fun tbh
I just want snow now
I find that exercising outdoors helps more than exercising indoors
You should never move to the equator then
Every day of the year would be 6pm sunsets
Atleast here at 69°N we have lots of snow that brightens the day, and with the full moon lately it's been wonderful outside
Beside some polar vortexes that've hit the area it's been really nice outside
I molde snør det fleire centimeter i kanskje en uke, og så e d en uke med 5-8 grader varme og regn

Probably not a plot hole but I still think it's weird
Our nation day is constitution day which was the 17th of may 1814
Independence day, somewhere in June probably 1905 isn't even a public holiday and it was a huge deal at the time
One more: Norway took Iceland, Greenland and the Faroes into a union with Denmark, then straight up didn´t take them along out of the union
Just left them there with Denmark
It´s like walking into a burning house with your kids, then exiting without them
>A common source of pride and ‘Englishness’ is 1066, the battle of Hastings
This is when a French dude came over and became king of England
The only reason that happened was because the English and Norse armies decimated each other at Stamford Bridge a month earlier
If Harold Godwinson had been a sensible man and yielded to Harald Hardrada you guys could've avoided all that silly frenchness that came with Willy the Conquerer
Independence from Denmark was more impactful than independence from Sweden, no
Having our own constitution meant we could govern ourselves, right
Norway governed itself way more during the union with Sweden than the union with Denmark
Don't make us raise up Tordenskjold from the grave
Sure, more impactful, but I still think it's weird why independence day isn't really celebrated

I paid to go close(r)
Wasn't worth it
But we went to some ruins near by (can't remember how near by since this is years ago)
The ruins were free to see, and much more fun
The wait and admission price during the summer is not worth it if you're local
I came back, didn't plan to go in, but discovered that the first Sunday of each month is free
So, I went on the free Sunday in december some years ago
No lines
You might want to read the question again
I think most people count by thousands so «tusen og én, tusen og to, tusen og tre» but my mom taught me to count elephants
«En elefant, to elefanter, tre elefanter
» It’s more fun that way
(My mom is danish, so this might be something they do in Denmark)
1001, 1002, 1003
In other words; one-thousand-and-one, one-thousand-and-two
Where I grew up in Norway we were taught to calmly count in thousands;
En-tusen, to-tusen, tre-tusen, fire-tusen, fem-tusen
Norway uses the same system
Also Norwegian
This is because Danish and Norwegian is nearly the same language, with only certain grammatic rules and pronounciation being different
(Danish uses Ds where Norwegians use Ts, for example
Like Knudsen and Knutsen)
[Sigh
(I'm sure none of you have seen this before, and that Danes isn't sick and tired of it
I don’t think every student who studie history of art is relying solely on a bachelor or a master degree
Most of the students in Norway, as I know of, choose a topic on their master degree on something more likely to give them a job, or just jumps over to some different subject to give them more weight on the job market
Brunost aka browncheese
Only norway
And whole wheat bread
I have to look for a long time to find some bread that is not loaf
Having a parade on our Independence Day
Edit: [link]
Same here
We even decorate our [christmas trees] with them
You should come to Norway and try our "burned almonds", which are caramelized
Looks like [this] or [this]
How do you feel about truncating or modernising Old Norse/Swedish names
Leif*r* *Ei*ríksson > Leif Eriksson
Erik*er* Magnusson > Erik Magnusson
We do use the native spelling, ish, of countries and places
We say "Italia" and "Hellas" for Italy and Greece
Norway has those, too
In fact we pretty much stole your best one
I think the Norwegian bunad is pretty well known
[Pic 1] and [pic 2]
That's interesting
It's almost unheard of in my area of Norway besides a few who have stared doing it
And mushrooms don't really have a place in local cuisine
Could someone make a map to visualize the number of saunas per capita in each country
I had some in sweden and norway
Yeah spelling was kind of a mess back then, but certain things like Eriker/Eirikr vs Eirik'/Eric' would never change due to spelling
That's a grammatical change, just like Epíkouros/Alexandros>Epikur'/Aleksander'. A bit different imo
Indeed
Where in Norway are you
In Eastern Norway mushroom picking is very big
In any large forest there will be mushroom controls to help you safely pick mushrooms
It's as big as berry picking here
Trøndelag
Ofc some people are picking mushrooms today, but it seems no one used to before recently
I just like Finland, ok
Sweden, the dirty rotten bastards
I'm surprised nobody said Norway
The vikings did a lot of killing, raping and pillaging during the medieval times
Norway is the country that gives out the Nobel Peace Price and making it seem like that’s all we want to happen
Especially as we participate in a lot of peace talks as a neutral party
We don’t say out loud that we are a very large ammunition producer so those countries that we try to stop shooting at each other with very high probability are using our ammunition to do so
Sweden
nah, iceland hasn’t done a lot of bad stuff
Don't forget the treatment of Saami people, sterilization, replacement of children to condition them into "Norwegians" and trying to destroy their culture and language, and a lot of this happened well into the 1980s
Netherlands and Switzerland have been filthy rich since the 19th century
Foreign companies surely help, but it is not like they have only gotten rich as a result of that as said by you
Norway went there, found no one, stayed for a bit, then left, then had other business to attend to in the aftermath of the Black Death, then it was re-explored by Denmark-Norway in the 1700s, and the Norwegian claim was handed over to Denmark in 1814 when Norway was given to Sweden
We would like Jemtland and Herjedalen back
Yes, I thought about that one at first, but someone from Sweden already said that, so it would be a boring answer
I think that was Danish vikings if not mistaken
you give them a lot of money
we should just dissolve every nation into small states so that they can’t do anything, you guys can lead the way, you have a history that
Oh yes
They're the best
A group from my bicycle club were having a meeting at my house to prepare for arranging a bike race, and one of the guys were to cut up 300 pieces of race info sheets (2  parts per sheet of paper), and he found my Fiskars scissor in the kitchen
"Oh no you don't", I said
"Don't use my GOOD scissor for cutting paper, use the cheap ass scissor from our clubs box of miscellaneous stuff over there"
"It's a scissor, you just buy a new one if it becomes dull".
"It's my *fiskars*, I don't want it to become dull"
Edit: My pair of scissors aren't orange but matte black, and it's the large kind with room for 3 fingers in the handle
My parents swear by them, they’ve got them in every imaginable size, from the smallest to cut threads while sewing or knitting to the biggest ones which chops down trees
They seem to be pretty popular here in general
Not me personally no
But my mum has one, and SHE CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT
Exactly the same story in my childhood
My so now has dedicated fabric scissors in her sewing set
A older pair of orange fiskars scissors lies in the kitchen drawer
I always feel like I'm breaking some law when I cut paper, string, chives or whatever with them
What if Napoleon won this time
Maybe Sweden would’ve been a part of Norway
I teach high school
I'm not worried about how far behind *my* students are
They can always catch up
But I happen to teach at an academic high school in a well-to-do area
I wonder how vocational students, who need more hands-on classroom time, are doing
I wonder how students who don't have their own laptop or tablet are doing, students who don't have a quiet place to work
Emotionally they are feeling the stress
What they mostly complain about is how things change
We're at school every day one week, then things change and we're at school some days but not others, then we're all online again
Recently we changed from at school every day to full online schooling in a single week
Similar things are happening with their activities
They have also been worrying about their grandparents and other family members for a year now, and the variant that is dominant in our area now is suddenly hitting the students themselves
Vaccines are coming more slowly than we had hoped and they know very well they are way, way down on the list
It's hard to ask teenagers not to be teenagers
They want to be with their friends and start finding their own space away from their families
My first thought; what does something like this even look like
Second thought; are apricots grown in Austria
Edit: I'm slightly disappointing in what they look like, but I believe you that they taste delicious
Dumplings seems to have never managed to cross the sea
(Denmark, do you have dumplings of some kind
> kroppkaka
you call those dumplings
We have kumle/kompe/raspeball (essentially different names on the same thing, - depending on which part of the country)
It's meat in the middle and potato and flour on the outside
[Photo]
So if that is dumplings, then I guess we have dumplings too
McDonald's chicken nuggets
Maybe some fries as well - if so, also a milkshake
At 11
45 pm
Nothing
It's way too late to eat anything
I wake up the next morning and eat a solid breakfast
Anything I could get my hands on
Atleast when I lived back where I grew up
County forced the gas station to close early so people wouldn't gather there and cause fights when out drinking as it was the only place you could buy any food after the grocery stores closed at 20
So yeh, you tried to survive on beer and nuts from the bar, but beeing a poor student you really didn't want to spend 5€ for a handful of peanuts
I’m a tiny person with “meh” tolerance alcohol
Four beers, unless I’ve been drinking for a whole day, would floor me lol
I’m not eating anything after four beers
After three though, my cravings are oddly specific
A good pasta carbonara, or fried rice
If I had four bears I don't think I could fit a pizza
Just leave it, all in good fun
Hmm
Maybe [Nidarosdomen] or perhaps something more modern like [the Norwegian Opera]
I think the English one is the Big Ben tower, from a foreigner's perspective
For Norway, probably one of the stave churches
I don't think it's the opera, that's Sidney
Maybe [Stortinget]
Edit: Actually, come to think of it, it may be our [Stave churches]
It's hard to say
Our country is better defined by its nature than its buildings
I was thinking about the castle
If we have to pick one, I would go with [Borgund stave church] even if [Urnes stave church] is the only one of them that's a UNESCO world heritage site
Yeah I think the stave churches is the closest we got
TIL the Big Ben tower has a name
When I had to commute, I used a cheap (€150) hybrid bike (road/offroad mix)
The price was the only thing I cared about
I wanted a bike so cheap that it didn't matter if something happened to it, I could just buy a new one
As for riding in traffic
My commute was about 12 km, and I had other options than riding in traffic pretty much the entire way (bike paths/sidewalks)
I have a road bike though, and I often end up in traffic with that one, and I just act like I would if I was driving a car or motorcycle
If you're on a bike on the road, you're just like any other vehicle
I’m in the process of buying a bike
So far this year i have used the city bike system to and from work every day on my short commute
40€ for a season pass
The system is up and running from may until the end of november (because of snow)
I live in a hilly, rainy city with lots of varying weather to consider
I use a hybrid road/offroad bike  (a GT Transeo) for my 7km commute with 200m inclination
I bought it used, so it is not a big loss if it gets stolen
What I need from a bike is:
1) Lots of gears to be able to handle the steep climb
My current one has 24 gears, which is perfect
2) Disk brakes, which is far more effective than rim brakes, especially in rainy weather
Climbing uphill means racing downhill, so this is essential
3) Needs to handle different tyre sizes
In summer I use 700/28, while my studded winter tyres are 700/35
We're considering getting a Tern GSD 10 for shopping and transport, but I will most likely keep my current bike for the commute
I need the workout and have showers at my office
I ride my GT transeo sport to school when its not winter
Mountain bike with big wheels(29 inches I think)
It’s not the best for commuting but I mostly use it in the winter where I need something able to handle the hell of salt and snow
Last bike lasted two years(it still works but something in the back wheel is messed up, forks are so rusted they don’t work anymore, chain is suffering)
It’s important to have good lights and not those cheap ones
Have had multiple fail on me and the tail light is currently taped on the bike
Cars will be irritated by you
And will speed past you if they can, and even when they shouldn’t. Was a bus that had stopped going opposite of me
Few cars behind
One of the cars had the guts to go past the others in my lane(the sidewalks can be filled with snow so road is the norm for me)
I quickly drove in the middle of the lane and forced him to drive backwards back to his lane
Other cars just pass when there is another car coming and almost push me off the road because I get so little space(was even one of our 3 section busses that did this)
Norway is also pretty decent for biking and a lot of people do it
Don’t know about sweden though
Also don’t forget about the wagon you put behind the bike with the space for two kids
So a type of hybrid bike as they are called
May I ask
What do you need a 6k bike for
I can understand if you do professionally cycling
well thats why the definition is pescatarian and not vegetarian
Not me, but my (adult) son went on a tour of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone a couple of years ago
You can only legally enter with a licensed guide
If you do what the guides tell you, the radiation level is very much safe
although they will tell you to wear a long-sleeved shirt or jacket, long pants, and closed shoes just in case
Don't go off the paths, into buildings, etc
, as radioactive dust may have collected there
Also at this point most of the buildings are nearing collapse, so they'd be unsafe to enter in any circumstances
There is a restored hotel inside the exclusion zone, though
You can spend the night if you're so inclined
Trees and other plants are basically taking over Pripyat, which is part of why the buildings are unsafe to enter
Plants were killed and did not recover in a few hard-hit areas, like the famous red forest, but mostly they are thriving now
The same is true of wildlife, which is flourishing since there are so few humans around
My son said they were visited during the tour by very friendly feral dogs, which like the humans because they often get the leftovers from the humans' lunches
900 - 1400, and 1814 - present
Edit: We could include the albeit very loose union with Sweden (1814 - 1905), and the Nazi occupation (1940 - 1945)
Hehe, um, you see, heh, it’s kinda complicated
1066-1537 (Norway brought together and lived happily)
1537-1814 (Under occupation by Denmark)
1814-1814 (We made our own laws and rights)
1814-1905 (Under occupation by Sweden)
1905-1940 (sweet freedom)
1940-1945 (at war with the nazis)
1945-present (we are free)
In conclusion, we only had 3 free periods after Norway came together
1814-1905 we were occupied by brother Sweden, and 1940-45 *ze* Germans
So there's that
Good point, although the union with Sweden was very loose
You are probably right
It was a mild invasion, which ended in a truce a few days later
Then we lived more or less happy hand in hand ever after ️
Venice
(However I did love the monastery youth hostel we stayed at there (run by real nuns)
Head nun was super strict, but really lovely at the same time)
Right now for me it’s Oslo
I’m stranded here in the rain after missing a flight, crippled with food poisoning
Seriously, fuck you Oslo
Explain this scam, please
Googling is unhelpful
> Did it disappoint you because it is actually sinking under tourists
Well that
and all the garbage in the channels
I would say all the garbage in the channels
So not at all like all the photos I'd seen beforehand,
Ah, the bracelet pests
Saw some like that in Milano once, but they weren't very persistent
Didn't know they randomly tell people "you look like africa".
Genuine question: are you saying there are mountains in the Oslo area
And if you want mountains and fjords you still don't go to Oslo, but to the west or north
Don't go to Oslo
The beauty of Oslo isn’t in the city centre, but the boroughs around IMO
What are your recommendations
I'm into food, culture and history
Also beaches are a bonus, but not a must
Oslo got Frogner and Grünerløkka as Stockholm has Östermalm and Södermalm
Old parts are dotted somewhere, not in one place like Gamla Stan
Funny though, much what you and others write here about Oslo was exactly what I felt in Stockholm, bland, not that nice city center and the architecture in the neighbourhoods around was all over the place, no symmetry like many streets in Oslo have
In general I guess it’s much about what you want of a city, do you want it to be a living city with real people or an amusement park for tourists (which mass tourism has done to great cities like Venice, Rome, Paris, the list can go on into the eternity)
Kind of fair, but to me it’s a clear border between the city centre with more commercial buildings and the neighbourhoods around with old residential buildings, cosy cafés and leafy streets
I don't think anyone would care
But why not look at the menu to find out
Asking the bartender instead of checking the menu gives me a "my time is worth more than your time" feeling, which seems especially rude when what you're after is the cheapest drink
Seems like a perfectly normal request, especially if you look like a student
You'd probably get back the options for the cheapest shots
In Iceland we typically know what’s going to be cheapest and just order that
Often there will even be a special, a pint of the cheapest beer (usually Gull) and a shot of the cheapest booze (usually Opal or Tópas) for something like 1000kr
They woulden't really care except for mabey being slightly annoyed of you later when you were drunk I guess
All the cheap shots cost basically the same since it is the alcohol tax that makes everything expensive
So you could have a flaming Sambuco, a Jägermeister, a vodka shot or a low cost whisky and they would cost about the same
And unless it was a fancy bar, the bartender would be fine with you asking for the cheapest shot
The cheapest shot will be ridiculously expensive anyway
Lol, what's rude about that
The bartender knows which one is cheapest, so it saves time for everyone to just ask instead of standing there uhm-ing and ah-ing while scanning the menu
That's what the bartender is for
Well, sure
The bartender probably knows everything on the menu
Why have a menu at all
Just ask the bartender about everything
What beers are on tap
What do they cost
While you stand uhm-ing and ah-ing while scanning the menu, the bartender can serve people in line who have already read the menu
Yeah, there usually are
Aren't there in Swedish bars
Often it's up on the wall behind the bar
If there's no menu then obviously people would have to ask, but in that case I'd assume they didn't have a large enough selection of shots to warrant much of a price comparison anyway
Is 3cl really common
We do 4cl for everything
Haha, if only
4 cl is both the norm and the max for all liquors and cocktails
The only drink you're allowed to serve with more booze is the Long Island Ice Tea, which can have a total of 6cl
You literally can't get a double whisky here or they'll lose their alcohol licence
From what I can remember it was a lot of our Viking history
Otherwise it was the classics - Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Babylonians, and Macedonia
Unfortunately it was mainly focused on European and Middle Eastern cultures
Egyptians, Greeks and Romans as far as I remember
And vikings, if you can call that ancient
The letter (not the sound you make when the letter is inside a word) itself is pronounced Hå. I can’t find the proper phonetic version, sorry, but I were to explain it in English letters, Hoh would probably be closest
Like in "hope"
The closest to the hå-sound would be "**ho**ver" and "**ho**pe".
Yeah
When someone ask you to help them spell out a letter, there’s always confusion with K and H lol
“...K...” “H??” “No, K.” “K??” “K for Kåre
Same with N and M.
Yeah, it’s almost like «hoe»
Not at all
Would LOVE to visit the ones I haven't been to yet
Moldova is high on the list
And Lithuania (since I've been to Estonia and Latvia)
Island one day hopefully
Edit: Island = Iceland
I wouldn't like to go somewhere I wasn't safe
I don't know how to handle corruption or religious fanaticism, so I'm staying away from Russia and I would be a little wary of going to Turkey
If I were gay, there would be more countries
I have no real desire to visit the ex-Sovjet states
No real reason really
Moscow could be a cool thing to check off the bucket list, and I have a wish to drive through Russia to see into North Korea (there's only one country between Norway and Korea
> Island one day hopefully
Which one
Amen to that
As a Canadian friend succinctly described my climate preferences: „you hate nice weather".
I've been to London several times and I never saw much garbage
Saw a few tourists of course, but that was to be expected
Would go back any time
The country
I'm a sessional lecturer at a uni and I love it when I have foreign students in my class who address me as "Dr
" or "Professor" or even "Professor Doctor [my last name]".
I'm just some 30-something dude who hasn't even finished his Ph
D yet and who plans on leaving academia as soon as I'm done
I'm not a professor and I never will be
But I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me feel important
Have you never heard of [Island] ?
Island is Norwegian spelling
haha
My mistake
Yes yes I know
"Langt-vekk-istan", far away land is the general expression, and you can tell someone to go "dit pepperen gror", where the pepper grows, which is basically used as a milder version of "fuck off"
My grandmother would also say she was in Africa if she got annoyed at us kids
"Langt-vekk-i-stan". Far away land
Not exactly the same idea, but similar
In Icelandic if we’re referring to a time long ago, we say „sautján hundruð og súrkál”, literally ‘seventeen hundred and sauerkraut’.
So gamla stan in Stockholm is like an old folks home
Le roi, c'est moi
the real mvp
I usually have a hard time with that
Whenever tourists try to say short phrases like that in Norwegian, I usually don't understand them at all, and they'll repeat it a few more times until I understand what they're trying to say
But maybe I just have a bad ear for 'accents'.
Most of the USA school shootings don't reach the news in Europe either
I didnt see it here, but doing a Google search I can see it was covered
However to much less of an extent
I could have missed some of them of course
But if you for instance [scroll down to 2018] most school shootings only resulted in one injured person, and no deaths
Which then would make rather uninteresting news outside of the US
Yes
Most school shootings have only one dead, or many times no deaths at all, only one or two people who got injured
So then there are more important news that fill the front pages
But the larger ones still have news interest outside the USA
I have never heard of anyone having a break-in while the they were at home
Almost all break-ins happens when the inhabitants are away
(Which is why we ask the neighbour to fetch our mail or ask them to make foot prints in the snow up to our front door)
I have never heard of anyone bringing a gun when doing a break-in
In Norway break-ins are somewhat rare compared to many other countries
Oslo and Seattle for instance have the same size population, but there are 15 times (!) more break-ins in Seattle
(And no, it is not because Seattle has a much larger black population, in fact it's about the same in both cities - around 7%)
A former boss did fetch his hunting gun once to scare off someone he thought was breaking into his garage
Turned out to be the mail man delivering a package earlier than normal, so he put it inside the garage to not wake anyone up
(Edit: he saw it through the window, so the mail man never saw neither him nor the gun)
I am not a lawyer, so there might be things that I've missed
The general principle is that the use of force to protect yourself has to be proportionate and appropriate in relation to the threat
That means that you cannot just go ahead and shoot a burglar, you need to have a legitimate fear that your life is in danger in order to go free
If you cannot prove that you're likely to face charges for manslaughter or second-degree murder
There are a lot of gun owners in Norway, but very few own handguns
Long guns are required to be stored safely
That means that either the weapon, or the bolt/firing pin and ammunition must be kept in a gun safe
Using a gun to kill someone in a potential life-threatenging situation where you had no other options or time to flee, call the police or resort to other means will seem suspiciuos
A home owner shooting an intruder will face questions on how come he had time to assemble the gun, but not time to flee or call the police
There was a case 25 years ago or so that illustrates the line between murder and self-defence
A home owner woke from noises downstairs and investigated
This home owner was a gun collector and had a collector's license for hand guns that he kept at home (this is legal, but quite rare)
He picked up a M1873 Colt Army Single Action revolver and confronted the burglar
He claimed that the burglar came at him with a steel pipe and shot him, killing the burglar at the spot
The court dismissed the self-defence claim and convicted the home owner of second-degree murder, even though there was substantial evidence indicating that the burglar indeed had held a steel pipe
If I remember the case correctly the court considered two vital things when they dismissed the self-defence claim:
1) The revolver used was a antique single action revolver
The fact that the home owner had cocked the hammer of the gun before he went downstairs indicated that his intentions where more than just to confront the burglar and hold him until the police arrived
In other words, he readied the gun to shoot before even knowing that he would be threatened
2) The ballistic evidence showed that the burglar was shot at some distance from the home owner, but the shots were fired before the burgler came close enough to pose a threat
My guess is that no judge in the US would even consider this case
The case illustrates that although you are within your rights to apply force to protect yourself in Norway, the threshold is quite high
Hunting licence with permission to keep weapons is easily accessible here
And if someone breaks in to your home you are allowed to do whatever to keep yourself and your family safe
But it will be a question about necessary force, not many situations calls for actually shooting a intruder
In Svalbard, Norway, it's mandatory to wear a rifle for self defence
...against polarbears
You’ll be sentenced anyway, the circumstance will only make the sentence milder, but when firearms are included most likely not much
There’s not much room for self defence in accordance to Norwegian criminal law at all, whatever you do and the circumstances are
Thank goodness burglars with chains saws are so rare
If you shoot someone you’ll definitively get a prison sentence, whatever the circumstances, but it might become milder because of the circumstances
I remember a case back in 2009, in Froland, where a guy killed an intruder
He was not sent to prison for any time
Edit: I looked it up and he did indeed get 1 year in prison even though there was nødverge present
I guess Finish criminal law is a bit different from our, even we’re both part of the Nordic legal tradition
In accordance to Norwegian criminal law there’s a very small room for self defence and response to provoked actions
Anders Behring Breivik used a legal Ruger 14 mini in the Utøya attack
He did use an illegal 20-round magazine
The law banning large magazines on semi-automatic rifles (I think it's 3+1) here in Norway has been in effect for decades and had nothing to do with terrorism
It's designed to prevent hunters from laying down a barrage of fire each autumn when the elk hunting season begins
Same regular police in rural areas as in the cities
We only have one type of police
Why is the millitary involved in policework on the countryside in France
Dont forget the Reindeer Police (Reinpolitiet)
We don't learn our history year by year
Excuse me, but do you only learn 300 years of history at school in the US
It's been a while since I left school, but we started with all the major Viking kings (1000 years ago) after a quick summary about the stone age and so on
Then we went on to the later middle age, Swedish/Danish rule, WW1, WW2, and some recent history
And probably a lot more I have forgotten now
What I remember the best is about the Viking kings, and a book written about a man having to hide during WW2
He was hiding in a snow cave because he was part of the resistance
A young girl (?) brought him food everyday
He got frost bite and had to cut his own toes off to survive
And he survived to write a book about it after the war
I think the book was called "9 liv" = "9 lives".
Maybe you're asking OP specifically but if you don't mind, I wanna make a guess
>!The black death arrived in Norway
Not much
Just a ship arriving in Björgvin
What if Haakon Magnus married Victoria and they became king and queen of Norway, and queen and king of Sweden, respectively
That would be awesome
Either 18 or 19 if you've spent the normal 3 years
Many people take a gap year or do the 1 year military service after that and before university
Yes
However you've gotta go through some stages before getting in
The first is just online, answering some questions
One of them is "do you want to go into the military", and if you answer "no" then there's little chance you'll get in
The next tests are physical
So basically if you don't want to, you're not getting in
In Norway you can basically dodge it nowadays simply if you're not motivated
So the mandatory conscription isn't quite as mandatory in practice, because they have enough people who actually are motivated each year
That varies a bit from year to year though
Drøbak is probably an abbreviation of "drøye bakker" which roughly means "long hills"
Tromsø: the "ø" is simply an older Danish-influenced spelling of "øy", meaning "island". Troms comes from the medieval name for the island the main settlement is located on, "Trums". The meaning is uncertain, but the most commonly accepted explanation is that it is connected to the word "strøm" (stream), referring to the waters surrounding the island
So the name means something like "stream-island".
I live on valderøy (Valder Island) and it's about 10 minutes away from Ålesund
The Island name comes from the viking age
There was a viking king living here called king Valder
The island i live in and the islands around it was a viking hot spot
Nesodden
Nes = headland (?), odde also headland if I'm correct
Odden was added due to many other places in Norway named Nes
Yes, Drjugbakki in old norwegian
I think Bergen actually is just a shortened version of Björgvin, like when you say it fast
For the record: Björg means mountain, vin means meadow
Vin is used in many other names
An important example is Vinland, which is what the Vikings named America upon discovery
As you can probably guess it means meadow land
Hanseatic low german influence goes brrrrrrrrr
The verb is "maler", and the sound is usually "prrr" with a rolling R, also in dialects that don't use rolling R's.
I see a lot of other countries have their word as a reference to a spindle
I wonder if our word is from grinding flour (male mel
That makes strangely much sense now that you mention it
I have never thought of it like that
It depends on what you wanna study, but I’ll go ahead and say NTNU for tech stuff, UiO if you wanna study medicine or law and UiT for Sami language and culture
NTNU
UIT actually has a fairly decent technology department
It's just that the ones with really good grades don't wanna move that far north
What about UiA
Kinda depends
NTNU is typically considered best for engineering subjects
NHH is most prestigious for business-related subjects
University of Oslo for law and possibly medicine as well
Not sure about other subjects
Yeah, I’m currently at NT-fak, it’s pretty good, and the professors and lecturers are amazing

Any movie where the entire social order breaks down because the power is out for ten minutes or whatever
Most societies aren't that frail - not even the US, I suspect
In a national emergency, people would be trying to help each other, not robbing their neighbours for canned food at gunpoint
I'd say most of them
I think it's harder to find movies where the plot doesn't fall apart for some reason or another
Children's movies with psychopathic teachers (like Harry Potter, Matilda etc
Any teacher that's deliberately cruel and unfair to their students^(\*) would be out on their ass in a very short time
^(\* Yes, even that one teacher you used to hate
They weren't really as bad as you remember
Most of these apply to Europe in general
maybe they hibernate during the summer
During/after Dagmar our house didn't have power for three days lol
Glad to hear it
Hollywood probably does more to perpetuate the stereotypes against America than anything else
No, though there is a bit variety of dialects almost everyone understand eachother, but some of them might be a bit too obscure for some people to understand
We don't have a standard dialect
I might avoid using certain words when I talk to someone who isn't from Bergen, but i won't change my dialect
Nope
Keeping all dialects equally valid is actually enforced by law here
There is no standard dialect, but a lot of people would leave out the hardest parts of their dalects if they're not understood
While this is true - Norwegians talk to each other in their own dialects and I can't really see many situations where they'd switch or be asked to switch - foreigners usually learn the Standard Urban East Norwegian dialect, and it's somewhat of a de facto "standard" to fall back to if there's any need
I don’t know about other places, but here in northern Norway, speaking to immigrants in Bokmål is definetely common
It’s more effective than having them not understand my dialect
Well Nynorsk is a writing language (if that makes sense) so there is no official way of speaking it, but it’s not hard to read and easy to understand
Me too
I can actually remember doing this once; I for the life of me couldn't remember the proper Norwegian word for "bekkalokk" (kumlokk) so I just said "manhole cover" instead
I used to teach Norwegian to refugees in the north, and we would be told to speak similar to bokmål to make it easier comprehensible for the people learning
There might be some, but I have never seen any, so I assume it’s quite rare
Reminds me of listening to my uncle speak Pfälzisch
OOOF
> So norwegian dialects can be far apart enough that you'd use a lingua franca for the both of you
Not really, rather that to talk Norwegian in another dialect than our own is so unimaginable that even speaking another language is almost preferable
There is no standard dialect here, and even on TV you'll hear all sorts of strange dialects, so people are generally so used to them that we have an easier time understanding each other
People will tell you there is no standard dialect, but that is not really true, for most of Norway, speaking the way bokmål is written, would be considered standard
I’m not saying anyone actually speaks bokmål, but everyone knows and can speak that way
What the actual f are you on about
The only places you'll find people speaking bokmål non-ironically is Bærum and west-Oslo
I have never met anyone who wouldn't recoil at the idea of changing their dialects to bokmål.
I live in Northern Norway, I dont speak bokmål, but if youre asking for a standard dialect, bokmål is the closest thing there is
Im not saying people speak it, if you could read you would see that
Im saying it is as close to a «standard» dialect as it gets
In the same way that if you ask a German this question they will tell you there is a standard even though there are dialects
I dont see a difference between this and bokmål. You can pronounce bokmål.

Laws on things concerning EU elections
Raspeballer/komle/kompe/klubb (depending on dialect)
Grated potato dumplings with a meat/fat/butter centre, that are simmered in water
Eaten with salted meat, pork knuckle or sausage, kohlrabi and butter
They have a similar thing in Sweden, I think its called Kroppkaka or Palt over there (again, depending on dialect)
On the west coast its usually eaten on a Thursday
Everyone has their own recipe, and you always think your dads/grandmothers/aunts etc etc makes the best komle (in my case, its my grandfathers recipe that's my favourite
He makes the Southern norwegian version (Kompe) that are extra large, extra white and filled with fat (med dott))
Any leftovers are cut up and fried off in a pan with butter so they crisp up
Delicious
I dont think we have
At least not similar to dumplings
Must be because dumplings are good
If you ask about terrible food I will be able to offer more
[Yes we do
Kompe / Kumle / Ball - with or without filling
Recipe on top is potatoe and flour dough, with sheep meet inside
No foreigners like it, but those of us who grew up with it LOVE it
You west coast people are weird
They're great, but I don't think they resemble "dumplings" as defined in this thread very well
Ribbe vs Pinnekjøtt for dinner at Christmas day
Golden or (yikes
) red Christmas soda
[I think someone wants to talk to you about that]
Christmas eve ;)
\#TEAMRIBBE
Ribbe
Pinnekjøtt is just foul smelling and not very good tasting, either
The milk should be left out, no need for that
Team golden representing
brown is NOT the couler of jul
Shit
I guess my urge to slap some sense into you only further validates the comment
BOI I don't know what type of pinnekjøtt you've had, but the trick is to make it just right with natural sticks (not the ones you buy at the store), the right side dish and, of course, a good glass of the right beer (IPA)
Boo
I'm evil
its KJ in norwegian
(or just K)
Actually separate taps is what I have too

Scouts often play a game which I'm not sure how to spell, but it's pronounced like "kappelan" with a Norwegian 'E'. The game goes as follow:
All participants stand normally in a circle
One person use a knife, axe or sharp stick and try to throw it into the ground next to someone else
The person closes to it has to put one foot next to where it landed (as long as it's standing still)
Then that person does the same to someone else
If you throw it in between someone's feet, they have to do a 180° and land with their feet in the same places
The goal of the game is to not fall or trip over and therefore be the last man standing
The strategy is to spread people's legs the most and then do the 180°-thing
It's really fun and a bit dangerous :D
[Dødsing] or Death Diving, is popular here
Trøndelag
In Norway its 8 pm on weekdays and 6 pm on saturdays
There is no buffer bc everyone knows about the limit and if you really need beer you should be able to get there before 6/8
I just used the insert link button on mobile, blame reddit
Hah I've never heard of it outside Norwegian scouts :D
Same over here
Alchohol sale from grocery stores 09-20 weekdays, 09-18 saturdays, closed sunday
Other rules apply for Vinmonopolet (more restrictive) and bars/restaurants/clubs (less restricrive)
God forbid we'd be able to get something to drink after 18 on saturdays
That law is absolutely insanely unnecessary
Yes, you can plan ahead, but sometimes time runs out, or you get invited to a party and need to grab a sixer or some wine on the way
Always
And thats just for beer and cider below 5%.
It's not alloud to sell anything stronger in stores
If you want to buy anything stronger like wine, spirits etc
You have to go to "Vinmonopolet" which is a state run alcohol monopoly
That usually close between 17 and 18 on weekdays and 15 on saturdays
It's not alloud to sell alcohol on sundays exept for in bars and resturants
Edit: This is meant to lower exsessive and/or impulsive drinking
I don't know if it works or not
Grocery stores in general are closed on sundays, and the ones allowed to be open (smaller than a certain size) are not allowed to sell alcohol on sundays and red days (public holidays)
The same rules apply for Vinmonopolet
Yeah I don't think it works either, but as I said, I don't really know
What I do know is that a lot of people are okey with the state alcohol monopoly, but not with the rules around beer and cider

Unsure why, perhaps just because it's a place you rarely hear about and it is within reasonable distance
No I don't speak Russian, and no I'm not sure if it is a good idea but still I really want to do it
And I love their sense of humour

Nice try but the Swedish one specifically used the word for a labor union, and the Danish one uses a generic word that also could mean a labor union or something like "association" (or "society" as in "student society")
I think "unionen" would be more specific and correct in both languages
Hode, skulder, kne og tå,

Knee and toe instead of knees and toes
And we say 'eyes, ears and cheeks that you can clap' where in the song you would then be clapping you cheeks
Its a fun Norwegian variation
Today I learned that the Irish have their own language
The song is stuck in my head now :D
Æ aswell, only place I still see it is in [Encyclopædia Britannica] although Latin
Vidkun Quisling
I've heard people from *other countries* call *their* traitors Quislings, that should tell you something
For those who might not know, he was Hitler's Norwegian nazi lapdog
He even kinda looks like Hitler, just without the mustache
He served as PM from 1942 until the war ended, but tried to take power through a coup d'état a few years before that, over the radio no less
tl;dr - traitorous nazi
Vidkun Abraham Quisling
A norwegian Nazi
Excecuted for treason after WWII
I'm reading about him now to brush up on my history and it's really, *really* funny
He called the Colonel at Elverum where the government was hiding and ordered him to "arrest the Marxist government" and he told Quisling to fuck off
He told the Chief of Police in Oslo to prepare a conference and was told to fuck off
He then told the Norwegian Shipowner Association to alert all ships to stay away from Allied harbors, and he was told to fuck right off
He had pretty much zero support in the Norwegian population
Sometimes I think US women are tougher than the rest of us
I have twins, so I'm part of a twin facebook group where mothers can ask for advice
And there are constantly US women going back to work after 6 weeks or 9 weeks or something
And they're not even complaining about it
I'm also part of a Norwegian group, where women CONSTANTLY complain about having to go back to work after 7-8 months
Especially when the baby refuses to take a bottle or whatever
(And for the record I'm one of those who think that after the last change in parent leave dads have gotten a too big chunk of it
True, but I'm still impressed by the fact that very few of them seem to complain about it
Yes it's great
Although some of us feel it was better before the last change (some of mum's weeks were given to dad)
But another GREAT change happened in June last year, where parents of twins got a longer leave than those giving birth to one child
I feel so lucky that my twins were born after June
Having twins is much harder work than having one baby, so I fully agree on the extra weeks given
Sorry you didn't get more time off work
How long is parent leave for the mothers in Switzerland
Some nurseries do take in newborns in the US
But my impression is that often the grandmother steps in, or they hire a nanny
> In Switzerland women get a standard 4 months
That is surprisingly short
(Here it's 14 months parent leave when having twins)
Are any of your political parties working on extending it
> I don't think there is a push to extend maternity leave,
Is it common for mothers to work
Or do many stay at home with the children while they are young
It's the same as in English, except we say "stein, Saks, papir" which makes it "rock, scissors, paper".
So if I've understood it correctly:
- Well beats rock and scissors
- Paper beats rock and well
- Scissors beats paper
- Rock beats scissors
There's no reason to ever pick rock, so doesn't the game just become well, paper, scissors

Not a world leader, but a Lithuanian talk show claimed that the Norwegian state kidnapped foreign children to get fresh blood because we have "the highet inbreeding in the world".  [
Also not a foreign leader, but after Breivik's massacre on July 22, 2011 a Fox News host/anchor asked if Norway was really a democracy because our police didn't carry guns
When a norwegian journalist asked the newly appointed ambassador to Norway, by Obama, some basic questions
He thought the capital of Norway was Sweden
He thought our progressive party, one of the two parties in government, were a terrorist nazi group
I also think he thought Norway had vikings because we are an island
Fair to say, Obama didn't give him the job in the long run
And the guy Trump appointed actually know a lot
The only out of 20 questions a journalist asked him and he got wrong was that he didn't think Norway bordered Russia, that Finland still held Petsamo
So a good score for a random foreigner tbh
Oh man, all the ignorance floating in the media and social media after the terrorist attack in Norway still gives me a headache
There are STILL *TONS* of people across the world who believe Breivik will be let out of prison after 21 years because of the dishonest narrative the foreign media ran with
There's a lot of misinformation about our child protective services in foreign media, in particular in the former East Bloc countries it would seem
I've heard misinformation coming from Romania, Russia and Bulgaria too, although not only regarding this matter
The Russians have some "interesting" theories about how we constantly spy on them
In any case, if you look up "Barnevernet" (name of our child protective services) in foreign media there's a lot of misinformation
Of course, our system isn't perfect and maybe in some cases our child protective services are too quick to make a conclusion, but generally I don't think it's bad to consider the safety of children
My impression from reading thought the comments so far:
- Nordics: No
- West and central Europe: Maybe
- South and east: Yes
For a moment there I thought everybody agreed to it
I agree with you
Citizenship comes with certain privileges, and this is one of them
For the same reason I totally agree with the fact that prisoners who are citizens should be able to vote as well, even while in prison

«Det finnes ikke dårlige vær, bare dårlig klær.»
It means There is no bad weather, only bad clothing
We love to go on walks no matter the weather and I think this is primarily said to kids to force them to go for a walk no matter the weather
Norwegian has "frisk som en fisk", (healthy like a fish), and I always thought that was a case of rhyming making the saying (a bit like Dutch "helaas pindakaas" - literally "unfortunately, peanut butter"), but if Polish has the same without the rhyme maybe not
Are fish really that healthy
Could be, I've taken a bus (and ferry from Sweden) to get to Poland, it's not that far compared to other countries in Europe, so something is bound to have come over, the other way too
The Norwegian word for taxi cab (drosje - sj makes a shh sound, final e is a schwa) is very clearly a Slavic loan word, and most people in Norway live closer to Poland than they do to Russia, even if we technically share a border
It means "too bad", and "peanut butter" rhymes with "unfortunately" in Dutch
I can in Scandinavia
Can do fine in Sweden and Denmark, sometimes Finland too
I frequently travel to Denmark and Sweden without using a single English word
Sweden and Denmark
I can speak a (very) little bit of german too
I would understand 99% of swedish and 3% of Danish
they sound like they have a potato in their throat
Is it okay to ask Finns if they speak Swedish, or is it rude
Nothing difficult about that
If anything it's easier than some Swedish dialects, as it's pretty clear
It's interesting because it kinda sounds like a Swedish version of an inner Finnmark dialect
I think Finland-Swedish are some of the best sounding Swedish dialects
In the case of that video, it's very easily understood since she enunciates very clearly, but other Finnish-Swedish dialects are close to impossible to understand
The woman in the video above is 100% understandable, that guy is about 20% understandable
He's clearly using a lot of local words, but the words that are "regular" Swedish are easy to understand
It reminds me of certain Norwegian dialects which are completely impossible to understand because they use so many local words
Then they switch to more common words instead, and you understand them perfectly
Driving into Sweden isn’t any hassle, on the larger crossings there’re custom offices which you might need to slow down through, sometimes there might be controls, but other than that nothing at all
By plane within Schengen there’re often no passport controls or anything
Last time I went to Italy through Frankfurt my passport wasn’t controlled once before I came to my hotel
Passports are sometimes controlled at gate, but nothing more than a glance
Norway-sweden crossing you have to slow down, and there are occational checks
I dont think i have been pulled over in my last 10-15 border crossings, but that is anecdotal of course
The checks are mainly to inspect the amount of alcohol and tobacco coming from the swedish side (EU) to the norwegian side, which is not i the EU, as alcohol and tobacco is considerably cheaper in sweden
On the Norwegian-Finnish border you do need to slow down while passing the customs (entirely on the Norwegian side), but not while passing the border itself
There are routine checks, but I've never been stopped
Going to Finland is pretty much as routine as a trip abroad can get, you can also cross by snowmobile
Very easy
There are no people living around at my nearest border control, you should travel slower sometimes, it is harmless
But you still have the feeling of the police stopping you, even though you know that's not happening
They could stop you only if they find out, with their sensors, that you have large amounts of illegal stuff in your vehicle
If you're a pedestrian, this doesn't apply
Hopefully
depending on where you cross it’s not even noticable
if you drive over to sweden in the more rural parts it’s literally just a bridge
there are some checkpoints for tolls but as far as i remember there’s barely any actual security
I can walk straight to sweden if i want

There's a line of jokes called "the swede, the Dane and the Norwegian". They are often competing in something very strange, and the swede and the Dane always fucks up because they're stupid, and the Norwegian wins because he's smart
Sweden
Sweden
But it's just brotherly love
Denmark
Same
Let’s not forget Denmark

How do you sink a frigate
You hire Norwegian crew
(We accidentally sunk two frigates the last 24 years)
It's funny, I've heard most of these but with norway replaced with sweden instead
Do the Belgians call you stupid
Because Norway and Sweden make the exact same jokes about each other
I have never noticed this before, but quite a few of these jokes involve doors
There is for instance one that goes:
- Why do Swedes leave the door open when going to the bathroom
So that no one can peep through the key hole
Denmark is like that retarded cousin you don't make fun of because it would just be mean
^^^\(sorry)
We don't really make fun of Denmark much
How many times have you heard a "danskevits"? I think I have heard more jokes about Finns than about Danes
Danes are just the average guys in the "The Swede, the Dane and the Norwegian" style of jokes
Hvilken militær makt da
Husk at det er vi som er i NATO her
But at least you've got a fully lit highway system so that you can see the potholes, right
Yup
Yes our jokes are absolutely only about Sweden, but have you ever talked about Denmark and not cracked a joke about the potato they have stuck in their throats
Worked with some Estonians, to me it sounded like finnish with some russian in it
They did not like the part about sounding russian
As long as you're not taunting your favorite neighbor to the north, it's fine by us
Only once and it was because the King of Norway and Sweden married the Queen of Denmark
After the dissolution of the Kalmar Union it would of course continue as Denmark-Norway, why wouldn't it it was only one royal family
I can't really remember any jokes right now, but I remember my friends dad from the north of Norway often told jokes about Finns
The jokes normally involve two characters, Pekka and Toivonen who live near lake Enare
The jokes are about them being able to drink huge amounts of heavy alcohol, that they are hard and tough, that they are a little simple in their ways and that Finns are sexually liberal but also introvert and not a people of many words
I think some of the predjudices Norwegians hold against Finns come from Finnish television plays that were aired on Norwegian state tv, NRK
The plays were extremely wierd and dull, and Finnish television play has become synonymous with something broing and incomprehensible
One difference from the jokes about Swedes is that some of the jokes paint the Finns in a very positive light
Example of a Finn joke:
Pekka and Toivonen were drinking vodka at a pub near lake Enare
"Cheers
", said Pekka
"Are we drinking or are we talking
", said Toivonen angrily
6°C. I would like it to be around 22 so it's a little chilly for me
About 21 °C, which is just about the right temperature
Below 18 °C starts being chilly
Below 16 °C is cold
I have a fairly new and well insulated home, and the living room has gas fireplace with timer and thermostat
I set it to give a bit of heat at 16 o clock, which usually lasts all night, especially if I cook a meal
If the sun shines, the fireplace needn't light up because the large windows absorb lots of heat
We usually keep indoor temperature around 20 for most rooms
My bedroom is 16°C. Just perfect
1°C right now and 40% humidity
Everything below 20° is a bit cold
Around 15° is perfect for a bedroom at night, preferably a tad colder
Currently 17° C. I'd prefer a couple of degrees warmer
I am in my bathroom, so here it is 25,5
In the rest of the house, around 20-21
23 degrees right now, but have it set for 25
I like being almost nekkid
20⁰-ish somewhere
A bit warmer in my bedroom than I usually like, my partner keeps shutting the windows (I like to sleep with the windows open all year, he doesn't)
Nothing like a crisp, cold bedroom
Rest of the house is a bit chillier than usual at about 20⁰. Its started to dip to 0⁰ and below now here on the west coast of Norway, which is when I usually have to bump the heating up a little as the floor heating is no longer quite enough to take the slight chill out of the air
That said, I've lived in the UK and Australia, and its *much* colder in the houses in winter due to shoddy insulation
19°, just cold enough to be uncomfortable, but not cold enough for me to actually change it
23 rn and perfect
Anything below 21 is cold
Bedroom is cold though, around 15 and sometimes lower if it's cold outside; window is always open
>But also have seen people from Northern Europe saying that 26-27º outside is really hot
That's so weird and I can't understand
Yeah I don't understand that either
26-27º is freaking nice
Then again I don't like cold weather
#cursed
Well, I've got a thermometer in my room
I have the temperature at a nice 23-24 usually, and I always wear shorts and a t-shirt inside
We’d like to keep our fishing rights, like the Swede said
We voted no to joining twice
Voting yes would be shooting ourselves in the foot for the Norwegians outside cities and probably kill of whole communities
We couldn't compete with industrial farms down in Europe or accept the EU fishing policy
[As seen in the map] of the vote, only areas next to towns around Oslo, west and Trondheim voted yes
We certainly don't want to be a part of the EU, and resistance to the EEA as well is growing, especially with how the current government forced the ACER deal
A major reason that is not mentioned, if we were to join the EU now we would have to convert to the Euro currency, and abolish the krone
In other words we would loose control over our monetary policy
This isn´t necessary a bad thing as we would have a more stable currency that would make us more competitive in the global economy
However, there is a major problem, our economy is fundamentally different (Germany makes cars, etc
) from the large players in the EU that control the monetary policy for the Euro
Not only are we different, but we are polar opposites from the likes of Germany, who makes cars and we export oil
When the oil prices are high, that is bad for the German automobile industry, but good for the Norwegian oil and gas industry
Hence Germany is motivated to stabilize the economy with monetary policy at completely different stages of the economic cycle than Norway
In other words, there are quite natural causes why we are not in the EU, and this is something the EU recognizes, hence the pretty decent EEA cooperation
Short answer: Because we don't want to
We don't want to get in
We see no point in joining the EU
We've voted on it in 1972 and in 1994
Both times, the "no"-side won with 53
5% and 52
2%. My guess is that if we were to have another voting now, the "no"-side would be win again with a larger majority
It has shrunk a lot since then though
Norwegians would mind a part of Serbia being Norwegian, though
We're not joining the EU
That is not an issue
Why should we
We’ve only had that twice - 1972 and 1994
So certainly not every 10 years
No way
We would like to stay a sovereign state
The EU resistance movement is too strong here
I think the lastest polls show 70 % against, 20 % for, and 10 % undecided
No big deal
I like it as it currently is
Because we’d like to have Norwegian goods; Norwegian milk and so on
I’d certainly be a reason for the “no” side to hopefully win
Although I hope o never have to vote about it
I don't think it includes the right to acquire real estate
The wiki page doesn't seem to mention it and I know Denmark has restrictions on it
> No big deal
I like it as it currently is
Me too
We're not interested in joining the EU
Correct
I certainly hope not
I mean, we might, in the future, but I hope it’s not when I’m alive
It does not indeed, which is why leading figures are now talking about leaving the EEA
As the other guy above me is saying, the left parties, Rødt and SV and probably the Labor Party as well, is campaigning for leaving the EEA
There are only minor complaints when people run into some sort of EU regulation that they don't understand the point of
Like my brother helped building a public playground, and they had to follow (in his words) some ridiculous EU standards
Mostly people are perfectly fine with the status quo
There are always some that want to join, and some that don’t. I’ve never had a discussion about it, besides in my political science class in high school
And I haven’t ever really heard people complaining about it either
There are legitimate discussions
The biggest subdivision of the biggest trade union have come out against the EEA
It might result in the entire trade union changing their view to be against the EEA
The trade union has over one fifth of our population as members and their opinion cannot be ignored by any leftist government, which we probably will get after next parliament election
Well
The thing about Brexit is that there seems to be no plan whatsoever
Some don’t want anything do to with the EU
They don’t seem to come to an agreement
That is seen as a giant mistake
We are
I support Brexit since it's the will of the people of Britain made manifest
If they want to leave the EU, then I don't see why they shouldn't be able to
Yes
Or at least most people
I'm happy with the norway not being a full member and would like it to stay that way
But I think eu is great and the best thing to happen in Europe the last centuries
I cant understand how a country can willingly do that to themselves
> I mean it's easy to check from Sweden and Finland which arguments are real and which ones are myths
Sweden is hardly the best example of thriving rural areas though
How's Bulgaria these days
Yeah
That’s exactly why
That and that people are generally just more anti-EU and anti-EEA now
I think it’s 70/20/10 (against/for/unsure) for joining the EU
It’s certainly not gonna get better now that the UK is leaving
Leaving the EEA is a semi-big issue for the most left political parties like Rødt (Red) and SV (Socalist Left-Party), this time among the local elections which are happening in just a week
Not necessarily, but if they had some kind of plan that they could agree on
Going to a website "språkrådet" (Language council of Norway) i found a list of "words of the year" which is a new word or a word with new origins which has been prevalent that year
List started in 2008 so might as well take them all in
* 2008: "Finanskrise" (Financial crisis)
Not a new word (1947), but it was hardly used until this year
* 2009: "Svineinfluensa" (Swine flu)
No brainer, the big thing that year
* 2010: "Askefast" (Ash stuck)
Eyjafjallajökull
* 2011: "Rosetog" (Rose train)
July massacre
* 2012: "Å nave" (To "use" the norwegian social services)
Basically, a lot of people were though to be using the Norwegian social services just because they could, and not because something were actually wrong with them so much that they couldnt work
* 2013: "Sakte tv" (Slow TV)
24/7 live show from Hurtigruta while it sailed from Bergen to Kirkenes
* 2014: Fremmedkriger (Foreign warrior)
That wrod itself is new in Norwegian, but there are other older words which have been used in the past
* 2015: "Det grønne skiftet" (The green change)
Climate change and all that stuff
* 2016: "Hverdagsintegrering" (Everyday integration)
What people to in their normal days to help integrate immigrants/refugees into our society
* 2017: "Falske nyheter" (Fake news)
Donald Trump
* 2018: "Skjebnelandsmøte" (Fate congress, direct translation)
In Norwegian politics, it was a huge thing going on that could potentionally fuck up the government
We call the same pute-TV, pillow TV
I like the new Norwegian word "rekkeviddeangst" (range anxiety) which is the anxiety electric car owners have for running out of power
Like what
That last one made me snort
After the 2017 election three rightwing parties formed a coalition, Høyre, Venstre and FRP
However, they were a minority government, and to pass anything they needed the support of the The Christian democrat party
Internally in the Christian democrat party, however, there was a debate
Many members supported fully joining the rightwing coalition government, but many supported joining the left and establishing a new government
The party leader supported aligning the party with the left while the second in command wanted to align them towards the right
This all was decided at the Christian party’s national congress (landsmøte)
At said meeting they decided to join the rightwing in their coalition government and since then they have been incredibly unpopular, struggling to get above 2
5% in the polls
Basically, one of the parties in power ("KRF") had a congress
They would vote if they wanted to support "Høyre" which was (still is) the dominant party in power at that time
I did not follow this much at all but the rundown is something along these lines
&#x200B;
KRF had a congress, would vote to support Høyre, or leave them to join the opposition parties
If they left Høyre, and joined the opposition, the opposition parties would vote to remove Erna Solberg (Høyre) as prime minister
At KRF's congress, the final vote was to stay with Høyre, and as such the leader of KRF had to (or had said in advance) that he would leave his position
It's a lot more to it than what i said above
KRF is also a party in heavy decline, but needed by Høyre (along with other parties) to keep power
Well they are liberal
Back in the day (prior to the labour party) they were the left in Norway
Now days not so much
(For those who don’t speak a scandinavian language “Venstre” means “left”)
Well
depends, the most likely thing to happend to you is if there is a moose roaming, those things are scary
For the rest, nah, i wouldnt be too worried
But those mooses
for real
Bergen, Norway: I don't remember ever being worried about safety
Obviously, crime is not 0, but it is not at a rate where I have to even start thinking of looking over my shoulder
I go on walks most evenings, between 20:00 and 23:00 and I have abseloutley zero worries of anything happening to me
I consider it virtually exactly as safe as walking during midday
It's one of the biggest cities in Norway but it's very safe
Never had problems myself or heard from others
In general this applies to 99
9% of the country not just my city
Small town of approx 20k inhabitants
If you stay away from the bar street, you're golden
I don't think anyone's been robbed on the streets here
Some might have been knocked down by a drunk/drugged idiot, but that's pretty rare, at least un-provoked
[The Hardanger Fiddle] is our national musical instrument, it is a violin with sympathetic strings underneath the playing strings
examples of use would be [the rohan theme] and this [folk song]
Learned about this instrument when I was a young boy reading Don Rosa's story about Sampo
That comic is basically most of my knowledge about Finland now that I think about it
Langeleik is also a Norwegian instrument, but less used and not «the national instrument».
I also thought of the "munnharpe" (mouth harp)
Funny enough, I very recently saw that there is an indigenous instrument in Taiwan that has the *exact* same sound as the mouth harp
It's just shaped a bit differently and the playing technique is a bit different, but they have the same sound
They use older instruments of broader Scandinavian/Nordic origins, such as the tagelharpa and goat horn
Einar Selvik (frontman of Wardruna, and other projects of his) is a damn national treasure, I love his music so much
Yes
One of the members (Eilif Gundersen) was actually one of my teachers during my first year at high school a few years back, teaching drawing of al things
Great teacher and even greater person
At the time I had no idea he was part of the band that produced the music for Vikings
When the Nazis tried to invade Oslo in 1940, they had to sail past a fortress that was strategically important for Norway
In the days before, there was a lot happening in Norwegian waters so when the first ship sailed in early I'm the morning, the soldiers at the fortress did not know if it was british, german or from somewhere else
The commander, Colonel Birger Eriksen, was asked what to do and he replied with two great quotes: "Damn straight we're firing live ammunition
" and "Either I’ll be court-martialed or else I will be a war hero, Fire
It turned out to be the German heavy cruiser *Blücher*. The fortress sank it with two torpedoes
The rest of the German fleet turned around and went ashore further south
This gave the Norwegian King and government enough time to flee with the gold reserves
There was a great movie made some time ago with this battle as the opening scene:
Its not a city, rather a group of small islands of the coast
Our most notable event has to be the famous norwegian priest, called Petter Dass, was born here
Its only got a population of 1800
Drøbak, Norway
Oscarsborg Fortress sunk the German Cruiser 'Blucher' and halted Operation Weserubung on April 9th 1940
This allowed the royal family and the government to have enough time to escape by train northwards
Trondheim
Probably the building of Nidarosdomen between 1070 and 1300, it became the most important church in Norway and according to the constitution the place where monarch shall get crowned until we abolished that act
I would guess you're famous for [limericks] as well
I was thinking more along the lines of the 2015 Ski World Championship
Speaking as a Norwegian I can't think of any similar estate or institution that wholly owns the rights to the author's work (living authors probably being the exception here), although we do have produced many great, influential authors over time as well
My favourites
Loved reading both the books and watching the movies
Oh there are too many, but here are some that come to mind:
Do = toilet
Store = big(plural)
Bad = bathroom
Fart = speed
Pupper(another word for puppy) = boobs
God = good
Barn = child
Her = here
Sure = sour(plural)
Dress = suit
Boss = trash(in the west)
And the popular one:
Gift = married/poison
Norwegian rally racer Petter Solberg's English is infamously bad
There was a skit about him where he said "It's not the fart that kills you, it's the smell", which frankly wouldn't be too much of a surprise if it was a real quote, considering:
Fart=speed
Smell=bang
Fag is like school subject
Fart means speed and smell means the sound something makes when you hit it on something
Someone said this "it's not the fart that kills you it's the smell"
I speak a mix of English and Norwegian to my boyfriend
*kokk* means chef in Norwegian too but is pronounced like cock
He finds it hilarious, so he never corrects me
So even to this day I just mix it at the wrong time
Result:
''I wonder if X restaurant has some nice cocks over there, I heard they make fushion
Gift means both poison and married in Norwegian
"Rape" - to burp
"After" - mouth ulcers
"Smell" - bang (not *that* kind of bang), loud sound
Fat = a tray
Mat = food
Have = garden (old people say that)
I remember going to Sweden as a kid, I always thought kiss was so funny
We still have it, you guys changed the spelling (husbond(e) vs husband)
Not exactly
The infinitive form would be "å gifte"
(where "å" in this setting is the norwegian equalent of "to" in "to marry")
Gift is the adjective form when it comes to the word for married, "de er gift" = "they are married"
It’s the noun form when it comes to the word for poison
(I hope this made sense, I’m sorry if it didn’t)
Rape means 'to burp' in Norwegian :)
Yeah, we also have "medgift" as dowry
Some people will be annoyed by the sheer amount of tourists in their home city
There's no avoiding that, and it's not your fault - if there are too many tourists, the fault lies with the government who has failed to regulate it, which means it's ultimately the responsibility of the locals themselves
Looking at you, *Venice*.
You asking this question already shows you’re aware and respectful
Have a nice trip, and welcome
If you ask someone "How are you
", they will (hopefully) reply, but they will probably not remember that they are supposed to ask you back instead of explaining to you how they are actually doing
A simple "hei" (prunonced "Hey") in these parts of the world will actually be more than enough when for instance approaching the person behind the counter of a shop
> Also, use your inside voice outside and your outside voice inside
What a clever way of putting it
Never thought about explaining it that way
> I'm shuddering at imagining how rude I'd be in Alabama if I just barked out "hey" to whoever was behind the counter
It's because it has a different meaning
Here it means "hello"  :)
Couldn't you say "hi there" with a smile
Or would that still be slightly rude
Using outside voice inside is not disturbing anyone, so feel free to speak as loud as you wish
Using inside voice while being outside in public is the polite thing to do
Extremely annoying having to listen to someone else's (loud) conversation while on the bus for instance
(That includes someone speaking on the phone with a loud voice)
I found this annoying aswell when I was in amsterdam (as a turist) I only smoked in a secluded part of a park, as if it was illegal
In my defence I think it is illegal to smoke in public in Amsterdam, but im not clear on the rules
> “Excuse me, sir/ma’am” would be the standard way to call someone’s attention
We would say "ynskyld" (means both 'exuse me' and 'sorry') to get their attention
If we already have their attention, "hi"and a smile is enough
Calling someone sir/maam however is not under any circumstances a common thing to do
We address everyone and anyone by first name; the doctor, the teacher, the lawyer, the prime minister
Talking ABOUT them however we might add doctor so and so, or prime minister Erna (that's her first name)
But this is just to easier explain who we are talking about
I imagine Scandinavians might step on many toes when moving elsewhere where you are supposed to be more formal
But its been like this since the 70's, so by now we know no other way up here
I was quite shocked when I found out my girlfriend (German) preferred sweet popcorn
I didn't even think this existed
As a Norwegian, I've only eaten salty popcorn
I like both
Having grown up in both UK and Norway we had toffee popcorn in the UK that is sweet, and then the salty in Norway
Later I found out about using coconut oil and flavacol, I cant go back to regular salted
definitely not
"In Europe you don't have free speech
"Private gun ownership is not allowed in Europe".
"No free speech"
"Socialist Europe"
Probably anything coming from right-wngers in the USA who think we'e all socialist, godless hellholes overrun with Muslims, getting Aloha snackbared every week and living under Shakira Law (May Her Hips Never Lie)
Well, at least it's what they think of Western Europe
That it's possible for previously communist countries to be concidered anything other than eastern europe
Oddly enough, a lot of right-wingers in the USA seem to love Eastern Europe now because you're all super white and anti-immigrant, and you don't tolerate homosexuality as much
Basically, you're portrayed as the opposite of Western Europe (rich but decadent, too liberal, weak)
"Also, you're overrun by Muslims while being extremely homogenous
Yes, I've heard that one several times too
Then I usually show them the [Press Freedom Index]
Another one is: private gun ownership is not allowed in Europe
(so not sure how they believe we kill the deer and moose
Bow and arrow
“Your policies only work because you have like 10
000 people and the USA protects you
Hygge
Do you know where this stereotype comes from
It would be sort of understandable if English-speakers were the only pale-skinned folks who had a significant presence in the East Asian region, but Taiwan had a Dutch presence for a while, Indonesia even longer, the French were in Indochina, plus the various foreign concessions in mainland China and the Russian Empire/Soviet Union/Russian Federation directly to the north of both China and Japan, where they even use a different script
You'd think people would have noticed that all these pale foreigners do not speak the same language
I don't think there is a stereotype that everyone with East Asian features are native speakers of Mandarin Chinese or whatever
same, i wish they were thought a little more about the rest of the world in america
> • "In Europe there is nudity in cereal commercials" - visited Scandinavia (it was a bank commercial, not cereals
I once took an American friend to [the Vigeland park in Oslo] He was a very cool, outgoing 18 year old guy at the time
And the park **really** embarrassed him
Which I found so surprising at the time
to be fair, the british islands have always been sort of seperated from the redt of europe
i too would group the UK into european, but when someone asks me to name some european nations, you don’t come up first, ya know
Got to love how many African nations are better than the US in this index
> Oh, I even heard that countries like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are communist
I know
The argument is often "You have socialistic health care". and then I reply: "But you have socialistic public school".
And then we take it from there
I happen to live next to a shooting range
> I think Americans consider any restrictions on firearms equivalent to a ban
There are restrictions in the US as well though
In many of the states, if the police discover a handgun in my hand bag that I have no licence to carry I will get a large fine, or even risk going to prison
Also that the US is the only country in the world that has free speech as part of their constitution
(Their're not
For instance Norway, where I live, has had it as a law since 1814)
Aloha snackbar
Her Hips be praised
This does indeed happen:
[Catalan reporter told he is not white in the US]
[Picture of the guy in question] Looks like a fairly standard Southern European/Mediterranean look to me, but apparently that is un-white in North America
No, but the way i see it, geography is a science, so there is not room for disagreement on techincalities
The UN, the West and my culture claims that eastern europe = countries that used to be communist*. It's just so stupid and pointless to argue otherwise just to try to get concidered "good"(aka western), when that only undermines the country's history and geopolitical role/historical situation
/r/fakehistoryporn stuff
Yeah
It's a very dangerous situation if you reach a point where everyone have free speech, except journalists
Then how will the public get to know what is really going on
I did not expect his reaction at all
I mean - they are made of stone
i would say all the nordics, former soviet states, turkey and the UK are the 'outliers’ of europe
technically they’re european, but at the same time they have a pretty distinct culture and thus are 'not as european’ i guess
The latter is so ridiculous it's brilliant
In jokes like these i laugh just as much of the unrealistic stereotype as the joke, its just funny that people might beleive this is real
&#x200B;
I can't fint the clip, but Norway is mentioned several times in the Simpsons, one including some CIA ageent talking to Lisa, something about pressing her for some information, Lisa is ofcourse resisting and claiming her rights, where the agent talk about something patriotic and telling Lisa about other countries being worse of and people having to eat bugs to survive
Lisa rebutes: "What countries
and the agent replies: "Ever been to Norway
Lisa: "No
Agent: "Well they eat bugs in Norway"
A bit noisy
But luckily the shooting range is not in constant use
> Is it actually legal in Norway to own guns like hangun
Yes it's legal
What is illegal is owning a non-registered gun
(But it's not like Americans have free range either
In many states, if the police find a non-licenced gun in my hand bag I face a large fine or even prison
Does that mean that some Americans only view certain parts in the US as "free"? (If yes, do they plan to march over the borders to set the other states free
mmm yes this whole thing is probably something stemming from cold war propaganda
> Besides why should it be up to the west to determine how the east prefers to be known
Are you claiming that *basic geography* is a hoax made up by the capitalist west to undermine the then Soviet Union and it's allies for all time to come
> Exactly I live near Luxembourg and hating Portuguese people seems to be the norm
Why
[Serious question]
>  ..prevent anyone from legally carrying a firearm inside
Can you carry a gun where-ever you want outside (in your state)
> Does it seriously hurt western pride so much to say central europe when in the countries that prefer that term
This is where the historical perspective is importiant for the explenation
Of course the poles/early slavs lived in some of the areas that are Germany today (like there lived germans in modern western Poland rip) but the teutons (proto-germans) conquered the land right, thus essentially delcaring a perpetual race-war on the slavs
Now claiming that the teutons and slavs belong to the same culture and geographical region is just absurd and frankly it feels like a desperate move by the EU to balance the regions and satisfy people like you
> crime rate for concealed carriers is lower
According to this the crime rate went up:
*"The most comprehensive, and arguably most
rigorous, study on the effects of RTC laws was
recently published by economists John Donohue
(Stanford), Abhay Aneja (University of California,
Berkeley), and Kyle Weber (Columbia)
Donohue
and colleagues found that violent crime rates
increased with each additional year a RTC
law was in place, presumably as more people
were carrying guns on their person and in their
vehicles
b,10 By years 7 through 10 following the
adoption of a RTC law, violent crime rates were
11% to 14% higher than predicted had such laws
not been in place
After controlling for changes
in incarceration rates and the number of police
per capita, RTC laws were associated with a
10% higher murder rate 10 years following the
adoption of RTC laws
11 This is consistent with
findings from a prior study showing that violent
crime increased with each year an RTC law was
in place 12 and a recent study that found RTC
laws are associated with a 10
6% increase in
homicides committed with handguns
[Source]
You don't like metal lyrics used as a comment
Well, the only reason the Norwegian police normally don't carry guns is that guns in general makes people more jumpy and paranoid
If everyone knows that no one is carrying a gun, then things tend to calm down
So to me it's perfectly logical that gun crime goes up when there are more people carrying guns in general - even if the "legal carriers" are not the ones necessarily doing the shooting
That doesn't change the fact that guns make people nervous
> I just don't believe in policing law abiding citizens on what they're allowed to do
Do you believe you should be allowed to carry a gun in schools, court houses, malls, airports, or while inside and airplane
My current flat in Oslo cost almost exactly that, three years ago
75 sqm, two bedrooms, very central (15-30 min walk to any touristy part of the city center)
Sadly (well, not for me) I think it's gone up in value by quite a lot since then
I'm guessing 100-200k EUR
The housing market here is crazy
That would be enough for a decent sized house (150 sqm+) with 3-4 bedrooms where I live
It's a village in the Norwegian countryside, about an hour away from Oslo
But the same house would be twice as expensive in a more urban area
A 40sqm apartment, decent location
Not amazing locations, but okay I guess
None with a good view though
Biggest I could find was 100sqm, but is sold as a redoing project, so you would have to add a couple ~~100k €~~ in addition if you want that one
Cheapest solo-house I could find(that is not a redoing project), is 770k€, but not a good location
Edit: I was probably being a bit ambitious saying 200k in renovations
When 100k could do the trick
Sorry about that
In my area of Oslo (40' inhabitants), there are two flats on the market right now for four million NOK
One is 72 m2 and the other is 66 m2
Both two bedrooms and well maintained
3 or 4 bedroom house with a large garden and garage, all newly redecorated
In a city it might get you a 2 bedroom apartment, depending on the area
Ålesund, Norway
You could get a hella nice and big house out on the islands, or an okey house on the main island
You will need 200k euros or more for a proper house in Ålesund that doesnt take another 100k to fix up
Just looking online now
Anything from 50 sqm to 89 sqm apartment near the city center
Outside the city you could get some detached homes with more square footage, but they're going to be old
Can you give an example
About the same around here as well, a couple of hours southeast of Oslo
Or a normal sized house with a garage if you go a few kilometres out of city centres
Where are you
You can get a 50-60 sqm in the suburbs of Oslo
Maybe in the Frogner or Grünerløkka area it's gonna be the prices you describe
What area (if you're comfortable saying, bydel/borough is enough)
I bought a 2br flat that's a bit more than 72 sqm for exactly four million ~3 years ago at "Nedre Kampen" (ie
Tøyen but on the Kampen side of Ring 2)
I think mine is worth a bit more now though
I’m not in Oslo, but close
I don’t want to say exactly where, but west of Oslo
Yeah that's incorrect of them
You could renovate an 80 sqm apt for 100K €
Bydel Østensjø
Should have been southwest, maybe
I miss going to Sweden, pescy covid regulations
Bergen is probably the biggest tourist destination in Norway, and [Fisketorget] should be on top of the list of tourist traps
It is marketed as an 800 year old market for fresh seafood, but in reality it consists of tents placed in a prime location
The sea food isn't really fresh, and anything is insanely overpriced
You can buy a seafood platter for €60, served in a tent on paper plates with plastic utensils
Twice the price in a decent restaurant
You can buy a can of sardines for €6 euro, 6 times the price of the supermarket
And of course, the ever present souveniers
All staff is multilingual, and no locals shop there
>In Copenhagen I would say Nyhavn
It isn't that much more expensive than other centrally located places in Copenhagen
Is it
It is what you expect
If you sit down somewhere in prime location prices tend to be high anywhere
It isn't really a tourist trap, just an expensive area
A tourist trap is something of low value that is explicitly marketed towards tourists and sold at inflated prices
The most expensive bottle of water I ever bought was in Venice
Supermarkets or one of the few specialty fish mongers
There's one right by the Fish market There's also a possibility to shop directly from a farmers market a couple of times a week, and there's also a fish truck
In other words, there's a lot of possibilities outside the fish market
I loved Rome, but Venice not so much
But I think I would like to visit some of the smaller towns in Italy next time I visit
Something to look forward to while we are all stuck in our own countries

That is a city
I thought it was only a ham
haha
They should have called it parmAsan
Ah ok
It's my husband's favourite cheese
(I prefer Gouda myself
Octopus can be translated to ink squirt
Not sure if it counts, but the norwegian colloquialism for a ushanka hat is bjørnefitte, or bear pussy in english
> “Jellyfish” in Irish is “smugairle róin”, which means “seal snot”.
In my dialect of Norwegian, they are called "kobbspy". "Kobbe" is the common seal or harbour seal, and "spy" means vomit (spew)
So seal vomit
Same in Norwegian: Løvetann
We use *Hestehov* (Horse hoof) for Tussilago farfara and *Løvetann* is for Taraxacum officinale
How do you get your post translated automatic in Reddit
across europe english is usually thought as a second language (to warying degrees) so i would assume everyone writes directly into english

Haha, you guys are the funniest, and I don't even like carrots
That's definitely true for some languages, but not so much for smaller languages
Translations into Norwegian are usually somewhere between decent and really bad
You know that you are that stereotype in Norway
The squirrel was impressed by your algebra
In Norway, the floor at street level is always called the first floor
The one above is the second floor etc
We don't have another word for ground floor, but some basements (especially in larger buildings) can be called "underetasje" (under-storey)
Ground level is 1st floor
Anything else gets really confusing
> there might be some odd exceptions
Yup
We start counting at 1
Not at 0
Oh yeah, that's an interesting theory
I've never thought about it before, but yeah we do have a lot of houses like that where the house has "ground floor" entrances in both the (half-)basement and the first floor
Maybe the countries who call it "ground floor" generally don't have those types of houses
The paper clip, the spraybox, the H-window, fertilizers and of course, the cheese slicer
- Gas turbine
- Slalom
- telemark
- ski jumping
- Spray cans
- Fertilizer
The cheese cutter
Don’t know if it’s famous in other parts of the world but the cheese slicer
It’s REALLY popular here in Norway
If you don’t have a cheese slicer in your home, it’s not a Norwegian household
SAS would disagree
The paperclip isn't actually Norwegian though
And Git
You working for SAS or what
Have you seen how impressive the other countries lists are
Just claim the invention for Norway and shhh
We have the counties Vestland=West land, Nordland=North land and Innlandet=Inland
Vestland and Innlandet are even brand new, so yeah, not very innovative
Every place name in Iceland is bland when you speak the language
> Australia is known for having very bland names for slot of places
Prime example would be most of our states and territories: Western Australia, South Australia, Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory
The only "interesting" names would be Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania
And how can I forget, the only place in Australia where snow can be found year round: The Snowy Mountains
Aren't there any places in Australia that kept their native names
We have a town called Mo i Rana
There's a commune named Rana
Mo means like, a plain
The name translates to: Plain in Rana
It would be as if my dads name was man with cap
Also, there seems to be towns called Ausfahrt every 5 km
Maybe Copenhagen/København
"Trading port"
The funny thing is, Nordland isn't even the northern most county, there are two more counties north of it
And all of the most common town and village names in Norway are geographical: Stormyra (the big wetland), Haugen (the hill), Åsen (another way to say the hill), Moen (the plain), Holmen (the island), Bakken (yet another way to say the hill),  Neset (the peninsula), Dalen (the valley)
[Here's an article that lists the 20 most common, in Norwegian
It had wine in abundance
Delicious wine
They also have a place called Bøgballe
Nordland used to, historically, cover what is now Nordland county, as well as 3/4 of today's Troms county
Finnmark was called something else before, and either way the borders up north between Russia and Norway was rather free flowing since it was in practice only the sami people who lived there
Not exactly, I think it is like one of your "län". We merged a few recently, thereby the new names
Small ball here
Yesh

Made me laugh
Thank you
Troms and Finnmark
Also Svalbard, although that's not really considered as a county
Not living in the EU but the EEA, i hope that my dear country doesn't have to follow the stupid article 13 rules
This wouldn't happen if all the nerds stopped pirating stuff
Glad we're not in the eu, yet at least
Why should we allow that
Because I don't want a situation where bands, movie makers etc
stop making stuff because they can't get paid (enough) from selling their stuff
Fewer than they would have without piracy, m8
I would say it's common to use garlic/sour cream dressing or BBQ sauce or something on the pizza
One of the big pizzachains sell those as extras
I personally dont use anything else
Oh yeah, Iceland is like the king of unnecessary, disappointing, heavy "sauces". It's all mostly processed, mayonnaise-like base with a loose hint of some kind of flavour that the name suggests
We have something called *hamborgarasósa*, which is this sticky, heavy, grossly sweet pink sauce people put on hamburgers
And then there's the *grænmetissósa*, "vegetable sauce", which just tastes vague
That's the only way to describe it
There are all kinds of varieties and they're all just as blah
But people put it on everything and dip everything in it
It's abundant
Can't forget Bearnaise, especially in Trøndelag
Everyone seems to use it here
Pros: high standard of living, equality, clean air and water, good and almost free healthcare, political stability, freedom of speech and general freedom to be who you are, pretty good and reliable public transport in central parts (especially in and around Oslo), almost free education, safety, gorgeous landscapes and vast wilderness open to all to use
Cons: 99% rural, little going on, expensive, not much cultural possibilities outside of the biggest “cities”, places without much career possibilities for people with higher education or to people at all, scarce variety in shops, general lack of possibilities outside of the “cities”, lack of places to socialise, little to none restaurant or bar culture outside of the biggest “cities”, introverted society, hard drinking culture, slow and difficult labour market to some measures, “Janteloven”, very expensive property market leading to many youngsters never having possibility to get their own place to live, not a part of the EU, living on a peninsula together with the Swedes with few ways to go to the rest of Europe except by plane, reliability on cars, economy reliant on oil, little interest in doing anything special (handicrafts, startups, etc
), bureaucracy, slow and difficult healthcare sector, endless planning of upgrades of the infrastructure
Pro: actual seasons
In February (today) you can enjoy the snow and at the same time look forward to the warm sunrays of spring
In spring you can enjoy the green freshness all the while looking forward to the summer heat and the first trip to the lake or beach
In summer you can enjoy the lazy sun and also look forward to fall when everything settles down
In the fall you can enjoy the crispness and the colours while you wait anticipating the first snowfall
Having something to look forward to is underrated
It just helps people look ahead in their lives, really
Everyone has activities they love for each of the four seasons
It is a reminder that everything will pass, and everything will be born again
Con: small-minded self absorbedness
Being the top rated country in almost every category makes people arrogant and egosentric
Every damn day top news stories are «some foreign celebrity thinks Norway is beautiful» or «one Norwegian talent is popular in USA» or something like that
It’s embarrasing
> 99% rural
Do you know what rural means
Which of the two
We have the term "Klok kone" (wise woman), although not used exclusively for this meaning
In general it means a woman knowledgeable in the field of old "medicine" like herbs, ointments etc
but in the context of a young girl "in trouble," the person who performs abortions would most often be referred to as a "klok kone"
Yes, I was also going to say *klok kone* if someone else didn't say it first
They were called "englemakersker" here too
Only "patriotic" if you listen to the refrain and nothing else
> Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
End up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just covering up
>Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
>Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man said "son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said "son, don't you understand"
>  I personally feel euroasian
That makes sense
Both Israel and Australia are European as they participate in the most Europeanist cultural event of all times: The Eurovision Song Contest
Morocco auditioned once, but was deemed un-european in contrast to the two other, European countries
> But- When faced with the above choice, most Israelis would say the feel more European than Asian
Even though we're not even partially in Europe, funnily enough
You participate in the Eurovision Song Contest
If that doesn't make you partly European I don't know what will
Yup, people often think of East Asia when you say "Asia". Who's the most famous Asian of all time
Few would immediately realize that the correct answer is "Jesus".
Brown cheese
I'm just kidding, we eat brown cheese all the time
[Lutefisk] Americans of Norwegian decent think this is the most Norwegian dish of all, but it is very unusual in Norway
A few people eat it once per year as a Christmas tradition, but most people would never even have tasted it (and for good reason if you ask me)
Call me crazy but I’m pretty sure I saw multiple natives eat Churros in the morning in Madrid
I agree
Or even reindeer with fried onions and mushrooms, with roasted potatoes, lingonberry jam and a light brown cream sauce (fløtesaus), delicious
I so miss the taste of just some salted reindeer meat snack
But like you said, expensive
Love finnish reindeer salami
Ah, "turtleneck"! Great to eat when you're a cold Prague winter tourist
That's like saying Christmas beer isn't common because more liters of lager is consumed
Honestly lutefisk consumption is through the roof if it's 10% of frozen pizza, when frozen pizza is available year round
Can also add Smalahove to this list, boiled sheep's head
Mostly eaten by tourists as a challenge
I haven't even seen lutefisk being served
It's pretty much non-existent where I grew up and where I live
Same here
I'm 27 and still never eaten or seen it served irl
I have some friends that eat it with family but that's about it
My parents eat it occasionally, but I don't see the point
It either tastes horribly or nothing at all
I just ate the bacon and potatoes
My dad had a pin he got on a "lutefiskbord" that said "lutefiskelskere elsk i kveld" (lutefishlovers (make) love tonight) and I thought it was the most disgusting sentence I had ever heard
In the north they have it year round, tried it first this summer
Smakte som tørrfisk hentet tilbake fra døden
Tørrfisk Men ikke fra døden
Har aldri hørt om at det spises året rundt
Føler meg lite norsk her
Vet ikke om de gjør det overalt, men i den lille fiske landsbyen gjor de det
Many superstitions are very international, like umbrellas indoor and walking under ladders and cracking a mirror
In Norway, and perhaps Scandinavia but still, it’s been an old belief that it’s Thor with the hammer that creates thunder
We also have this thing about trolls; often if you find a strange, stray Boulder, it from the old days was believed to be trolls who had been fighting by throwing rocks at each other
To scare children from walking alone down to the water, a story about Nøkken was made; a water creature that takes form of a white horse (amongst others) to lure you into the water
I remember one thing from school that hasn´t been mentioned yet
If you wear a necklace and the lock has moved and is showing in front a boy is thinking of you
If it was on the right hand side a dark haired boy and on the left it was a light haired boy
If someone found a hair on your clothes they should pick it up and measure it with their fingertips, and «count» with the alphabet to find out the first letter of the name of the boy that will marry you
If you pick a daisy you can think of a boy/girl and pluck the petals off and say «Loves, loves not» to find out if this person is in love with you
In Norway *Nøkken* is a creature that lives in bogs/rivers and will drag you into the water and drown you if you get too close
Basicly a way to scare children into not playing near bodies of water and in swamps
I like this one because it has a purpose
Also *Nisse* \- Small mischevious creatures, not goblins, not trolls, but a *Nisse -* often portrayed as a small male figure with a beard and a woolen pointy hat, kinda dressed as a farmhand: [here is an image] They are based on *vetter -* smaller demigods/creatures from the otherworld that look after the farms of humans on earth and have had several different names in different regions
They come with different roles, there is the *fjøsnisse* who resides in the barn, they are kinda chaotic lawfull, as they expect certain traditions to be held (porridge at christmas to be set out for them) and will do mischevious things if you don't uphold the tradition
Give rice porridge at Christmas to the barn midget
If you don't he will kill your animals, or make them sick at the very least
The sign that he is there is that the porridge is gone the next morning
(Because obviously it couldn't have been the cat who ate it
Obviously this is an old and outdated superstition, and I can't actually think of any superstition that still exist today
To add to this
If a child is left in the forest to die without a proper burial, they will turn into a dangerous spirit called Myklar, who will hunt people walking in the woods alone and latch onto their backs
They will ask to be taken to a graveyard, but if the person refuses or is unable to make it there, the Myklar will snap their neck
On christmas eve, you have to shoot at the sky to ward off evil spirits
(These next ones aren't very common and are very old, but they're cool)
On christmas eve, if you walk backwards around your house 3 times with a beer, then put the beer in your shoes, the next person to pick up/drink from that cup will be the person you marry
If you dress a chair in clothing for the opposite gender (these traditions are very old) and put a beer on it, then stare at it without thinking, you will marry the next person who drinks the beer
We have the cake thing too, is that not universal
I always assumed it was something everyone did, but now I’m kinda hoping it’s just a Scandinavian thing
This is what I learned as well
Hmm I remember the math notebook was green, then a small blue one for grammar, then the was kinda pinkish-redish-somethingish for everything else
I have kids in schools and they hardly use any folders at all
(Do school kids in other countries get lots of loose papers they need to put in folders
Being in Europe but not in the EU it is extremely confusing and frustrating dealing with ordering things online as you are never certain if you are to select the "Europe" option with the EU flag, or ROW
More often than not you are even redirected to the EU page, but the items won't ship outside the union, so a lot of goods simply cannot be bought by any private person
The sun sets at 15:00 in the winter, it's cold all the time and it's expensive
As for Northern Norway, I can't remember last time I saw the sun but I believe it's more than a month ago
The sun gets up 10:33 today, and goes away 13:11 again where i live
dark times are ahead
The sun set a few days ago here
Gonna see it again in January though
Preach, brother
Amen to this
The sun won't rise again until january here, the midnight sun in the summer is really nice though
Same
It's fairly common here to hear about Dutch people buying up remote little farms in Norway
I always thought it was due to population density
Never thought it might be due to lack of nature
Due to drinking
Or do Scots do it while sober
> or cat whistled
What happened to all the French gentlemen
This is different here
We have friends who are wealthy business people
Another friend is a poor single mum who is on social security
Our family are somewhere in the middle
We honestly couldn't care less
If this is our worst problem then we have it pretty good
This is why some Eurovision shows or something similar also have a French commentator
Makes sense
Says the German
Really
I thought that was Denmark
Here it won't rise above the horizon until the middle of January
There's still twilight for a few hours in the middle of the day, though
Where I live (Trondheim), it's pretty bright all night in the middle of summer
The sun sets at around 23:30 and rises at around 03:00 at the brightest
Of course, north of the arctic circle the sun doesn't set at all
I think so too
Sure summer is nice with daylight 24/7 but I really enjoy the cozy darkness of the winter
Nothing better than sitting inside by a fireplace sipping on a stout and enjoying the winter wonderland outside
Not open on sundays here at least
No stores, except some tiny food markets, are open on Sundays
It's a "resting day" :)
Eh, sovereignity, self-sufficiency, oil, and stuff
Tromsø! 69
69° ^^nice North
There are seasons
You got lots of nature too
In several parts of Norway the sea level is actually sinking
So this should be the safe place to be
> Social class isn’t entirely about wealth here, more just whatever class you were raised around
> You can be upper class and poor
Same as Wayne Rooney will always be working class despite being wealthy
So I hear
Still a somewhat unknown concept here
What would you say is the difference between being upper class and poor, and lets say middle class and well-educated with a healthy income
You can get a higher rate paying job to offset the cost of pizza
But you can't force your brain to release serotonin
Lutfiske is decidedly better than perpetual night
lol it doesnt seem like a joke to me
It seems like common sense, but eh as long as the boomers remain in control of politics, it won't happen
Hmm
I think we have more of a 9/1/1/1 (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall) month spread of season up here
So loosing upper class'ism takes one generation
How many generations would it take to become upper class
But if someone became super wealthy, and their children go to posh schools and hang out with other posh children
Would the children be considered upper class
If not, would their (still wealthy) grand children be considered upper class
> Worth noting that I am not in this social class so not sure how they react to newcomers who aren’t in the public eye (probably a mixed bag like the rest of us)
I sort of picture all upper class people to see something like Reddit at totally beneath them
In Norway I'd have to say Tromsø. Beautiful city and the people are lovely ️
Lofoten and Vesterålen maybe for region
I'd say it looks like but I'd rank it below Kristiansand still
Tbh, temperatures can lie a lot
a lot
-20 degrees in the middle of nowhere (such as Kautokeino/Karasjok, inner Finnmark) doesnt actually feel that cold at all
However, if you add that temperature to a coastal city or a place where "wet" air is regular it will be much much colder
When i was in the army i was stationed in inner Troms county, temps regularly went below -15 and -20, the coldest was -30
That said, in my home town, -10 with the usual wind we have and moist weather since we are coastal city is fucking cold, a lot colder than the dry air in -20/-30 range
Heck, you can actually go outside in a t-shirt in -20 dry weather and not be that bothered by it
It's around -20 in my city now(Trondheim) and I wouldn't say things are too different to what they are normally
Main thing is just you spend a lot more time indoors, no going out chilling in the park for a couple hours
I took a walk today in -18 or so and I try to get some exercise in(running or cross country skiing) a couple times per week
But other than that I stay inside
Society here is just designed around knowing it gets cold, and there are solutions in place to make sure it goes smoothly
You have snowplow veichles out early every morning if it has snowed out clearing the roads, sidewalks are applied gravel for extra grip if its slippery, food delivery has been done by car the couple times I've ordered recently etc, it's not seen as a huge hassle here when it's cold, it's just a season like the others and the cold weather eventually goes away
As far as clothing go I personally don't overdo it, I'm quite comfortable with the cold and I dont mind my face freezing in -20 for 10 min whilst I wait on the bus
It's a bit refreshing actually
I don't really wear any inside layers, just jeans as normal, sneakers but I get my winter jacket out when it dips below -5
I just bought a beanie and some leather gloves this winter actually
Before I just used my hoodie or put my hands in my pockets if cold hehe
I also grew up in an even colder city in the inland where it used to go down to -30 and I would say there the worst part was when u waited for 10-15 min for the bus and it didn't arrive lol
I you live in an area that might have very cold winters or some weeks with very cold weather, you have - at least I do - a really warm outer layer of clothing
I have a wool winter coat I can only use when it is really cold, if not I start sweating
And I have pair of winter boots
If you are going to be outside for a longer period of time, you can wear an inner layer of wool, like wool tights and long sleeved wool shirt under your regular shirt and pants
But in big cities you are usually not outside for that long, you are walking somewhere, you go into a store or the subway or a bus and walk some more
If you are in the cold for no longer than 30 minutes every time you are exposed to the cold, you can wear sneaker and jeans as long as you have a warm coat
Because in a city, you can always go inside somewhere and warm up
Diesels - especially older cars - do struggle to start in the cold and if you have an older car with a weak battery, the cold will kill your battery
But basically, if you live in a very cold area, everything in society is prepared for cold temperatures so most things work and life goes on as normal
Because what didn't work because of the cold was fixed the previous time it was really cold and it broke
Everything adapts to the environment, so cold weather is worse in areas where people are not prepared for cold weather
Thanks god it doesn't get very cold where I live
I get frostbite quite easily
I live on the western coast of Norway
It's usually arounc 0C in the winter, but we tend to get a couple of weeks that's way colder
The last 14 days have been between -10 and -15C , and today is a frisky -17C
There's a few things that we do to keep us warm
The first thing is wool
We use wool all over
I have a woolen sweather, woolen socks, wool soles in my boots as well as wool cap, scarf and mittens
My overcoat is wool, and if I plan to walk for more than 20 minutes I wear wool thermals beneath my pants
It's really no big deal, it's just part of my wardrobe
The second thing is that we keep moving
You'll see a lot of people walking, but very few are just hanging around
It's too cold to stay outdoors if you don't remain active
Handling cold isn't really that difficult
There's a few posters telling that they wear T-shirts in -20C, and that is probably true if you only plan to stay outside for a couple of minutes
Stay for longer, and you'll catch a seroius cold and possibly hyopthermia
You cannot train your body to handle cold, but you can adapt to the feeling of being cold
When a person starts to feel the cold the usual reaction is to get anxious
Feeling cold and freezing is uncomfortable
The trick is to learn how to ignore those signals while at same time dressing properly
You don't need to cover yourself in a snow suit to stay warm, but you need to thoroughly cover those part of your body that represents the greatest heat loss
Such as your head, your neck, your wrists and your ankles
Your torso, your arms and your legs needs covering too, but not necessarily too thick (then you'll break a sweat and start to freeze)
Freezing at fingers and toes are really uncomfortable too, so you need proper shoes, socks and mittens
Other than that, it's business as usual
You quickly learn how to use your nose to answer your phone instead of removing gloves or mittens
I have special gloves, one pair is thin, and has a special fiber (or whatever) that makes it possible to use touch-screen
My other pair is more for photography
, [Markhof Pro 2
0 gloves]
Actually, it rarely gets colder than -10
I believe it's also the northernmost city that has a yearly average temperature above zero
English
The exceptions would be if there is a domain-specific phrase it would only create confusion to translate, or if I'm writing a temporary comment to myself
English
But I have heard that some government projects require the code to be written in Norwegian
I have no experience with that though
Lidl only lasted 4 years in Norway
They where a joke here
When it was here it was probably considered the worst one
Both in the selection they sold, and how they treated their workers
That being said, I miss it
Certain things you could not buy anywhere else
I liked the shop
However it didn't survive the Norwegian market and they sold all their venues to Rema 1000
I go there when I'm in Germany though
And they had to abandon their initial store concept (without any local products) for the last two or so of those years
I went there exactly once, didn't see *any* recognizable products
Never went back
Yeah, people want familiarity and everything that is different or new, that's something bad
That goes for people as well
Not as much in the bigger cities cause there's so much variety of culture there, but across the land it is
However I love new things
I seek out stores that aren't of the most popular
I miss Lidl
Really
I just stayed in Poland for 6 months and mostly shopped at our local Lidl
There were constantly long queues and ultra slow cashiers, and really limited choices
Not that Biedronka is any better, I prefer Kaufland or Carrefour
That's why they didn't survive, the change came too late and by then they were dead
I found the store disorganized and the stuff they were selling their looked "shady" at best
The store smelled awful as well
A few years ago my best friend at work was a man
But we did not hang out outside work since we both were married
(If we would have done that we would obviously have brought our spouses along)
Before I married I had another male friend, and we went out for coffee, and the cinema being just friends
So yes - its completely normal, although sometimes you end up dating the person, or things will change quite a bit if you get another girlfriend/boyfriend
And having groups of friends where there is a mix of genders is also very common - and I would say - quite healthy
My son is in primary school, and the teacher has made an effort to make sure both girls and boys in the class are friends with each other
This to help make a good class environment
> Boys and girls meaning kids
Rarely I'd say
My sons best friend in kindergarden was a girl
They played together everyday from the age of 2-7
At 7 sadly some of the other boys teased him about it and he started to play more with the other boys
Really
I wonder why its different in Finland compared to the rest of the Nordic
Makes sense
I just say "hei" (hi)
The exception is when I've been job searching, then I'll answer with "hi, this is (name)", in case it's anyone from a job I've applied to
I just say "Hallo
" (not really a question, but with the upwards intonation)
“Ja, hallo” — “Yea, hello”
My grandma used to answer with “ja, værsågod” — “yes, please”
It’s also very common to answer with your last name or first name
I make and receive actual voice calls so infrequently that I'm genuinely thrown off when I get a call
If it's a number I recognize and I see a call from it, I'll answer and ask if everything's okay - otherwise why are you calling and not texting
If it's a number I don't know, I'll say "hello
" in a probably bewildered tone, and ask if it's really me they're looking for (and not Lionel Richie, like the song goes)
thats so strange that a lot of you just say hi - I always state my name, and so does most my friends and family members
Like "Hi you're talking to Lily whassap"
Pronto, Legrerg
Same
Even when it's a unknown number
Me and my husband always answer each other calls with "Nei, er det den karen
" (Is it that guy/man) lol
Usually we say it was unified under Harald Hårfagre around 880AD
But there were still some smaller kings around and the borders were different than they are now
But I think that is what would be the answer on a elementary school quiz if you catch my drift :)
According to the sagas, Norway was unified under Harald Fairhair ca
880
three dates come to mind
around year 1000 several small tribes and cheifdoms are united into the kingdom of norway
1814, we gain our independence from denmark after having been in a personal union with them for centuries, effectively being a part of denmark
this is also where we get our constitution
1905, we get our own king, seperate from the king of sweden, with which we had been under a personal union with, but with much more self control due to the constitution
personally i would say around year 1000 is when norway comes into being, but 1814 is when norway reaches it’s modern form
872 AD
The interesting part is that our founder "King Harald Fairhair" might just be a myth
Well, the first Norway was unified in 872, but then Kalmar happened and we eventually got a constitution and broke free from Denmark in 1814
only to be stuck in a union with Sweden until 1905
Your pick
But it was its own country before the brits occupied it in the 1700s no
You could also argue that it was in 1814, when the Danish "occupation" ended, we got partial sovereignty, and our own (and current) Constitution
Some would even say 1905, which is when the current political entity of Norway gained full independence from the Swedes
We just don't know if Harald Hårfagre ever existed, he's a bit like our Jesus
> around year 1000 several small tribes and cheifdoms are united into the kingdom of norway
880AD
Or 1884 when we (gradually) implemented parlamentarism
But yeah, Hårfagre or 1814 is probably the most correct time periods
Nah, lets stick with 880AD
I think I read that we're sure his son existed atleast Eirik Bloodaxe
Aha, didn't know that
Apparently my English isn't that good because I can't remember the English word for it: but my family has one of [these] (edit: trailer) that we use for transporting larger items
I dunno where you live, but our local IKEA here in Norway let's you rent a van for next to nothing for three hours to get your bigger purchases home
I've seen new neighbours abuse that system when they move in (often you need to buy new stuff when you move anyway)
Otherwise some petrol stations here rent them out too
Many stores that sell bulky materials offer free use of a trailer
Some even offer to load the stuff you want onto a trailer, so all you need to do is just drive there, hook it up and pay
The annoying thing is that you have to return it afterwards meaning you need to do an extra run
If a trailer is unsuitable I have access to lots of vans through my car sharing service
The vans is quite big, with a space around 6 m3
The bed is big enough to fit a huge stack of drywall or plywood sheets
Another option is simply to strap it to the roof
Most cars can have a 75-100kg load on the roof
That allows you to strap quite a few 5-6 meter long boards on top if you really need it (Personally I hate driving with something on my roof)
If the things you order are to heavy or to bulky you can always get it delivered
Big deliveries can turn out to be quite a show when the a lorry tries to navigate the corner of your narrow old street you deliberately did not mention when you paid the flat fee for delivery of 4 tons of concrete and three tons of building materials to your lot
Basicly this yeh
I usually have room for what I buy in the back of my stationwagon
I don't currently have a car with a trailer hook, but I've only needed it once in the past five years so I guess I can manage
Same in norway
Haha I actually did do that, but I just felt that "trailer" was the wrong word
That sounds lovely
It rains on average 231 days a year in my city so waiting for a day with no rain can take a while
Its free from ikea here
Ding ding ding, we have a winner
I actually don't know, I don't often see pick up trucks, and I don't know anyone who owns one
yeah I am calling this a lie
If he actually lived in Bergen he would have 134 days more
I used to call my aunt "dadda" as she was baby sitting me a lot when I was young
But I have not heard anyone else using that term
We Norwegians (at least in my fylke/kommune) have "Mat og Helse" (Food and Health) in 6th and 9th grade of school
We had classes, but no
They sucked dick and didn't teach anyone anything
This was more or less a decent way to sum up that entire school
Yeah, I think we did cooking in 6th-8th grade
I was a disaster, but it was great fun (and useful)
Yes, we had "Heimkunnskap" / "Mat & Helse" ("Home knowledge" / "Food & Health") in 6th and 9th grade
We didn't just learn to cook, but also how to deal with cleanliness and how to work in teams
I wouldn't really say that I actually learned anything, but they did spend two years trying to teach me
It was called heimkunnskap here too, the ages ago when I went to school
They call it Mat og helse (food and health) now, and it includes learning about nutrition and how it affects your health
I remember cooking classes in 9th grade as well as 5-7th grade
Knowing how to cook is not necessary or important
I strongly disagree
I get the impression that Russia is pretty sexist, and getting worse - [after all, they actually decriminalised some types of domestic violence only a couple of years ago
] I mean - if you have no legal recourse if your husband beats you black and blue, that will definitely make him stop beating you
&#x200B;
It's depressing - I've met quite a few Russians over here (we do, after all, share a border)
They're nice people, they deserve better than that
Haha maybe, I don’t know how old you are, but I’m 21
The year after I starred 8th grade was the year they started up with electives, so even though it isn’t long since I went to school it might be different
Oppose it
I have nothing against immigrants, but I believe they should learn the language if they want to become part of the society
I'm against it
I believe in tougher immigration
As few as possible, ideally
Next generation is not going to speak Norwegian well
Among people around thirty years old in Norway one third are immigrants
They have started to make children now which is why Oslo is in debt - we need a lot new schools and so on
I just bought a book about idioms by Per Egil Hegge, I don't know why I bother since only people above fifty understand them
If I didn't keep contact with a few friends from childhood and some family I would never meet anyone born and brought up here
There was even a problem with water dripping from my upstairs neighbours down to me, and they didn't even know English so I had to tell them in Spanish
Must learn Polish and Thai as well, I think
(But Korean is more fun)
Same with Norwegians
Embarrassing
I'm never going to those places because I hate those kind of "tourists" sitting down in Spain in their colonies, not knowing Spanish or English, collecting welfare and complaining about immigrants in Norway
EDIT: We even have a show called "charterfever" making "fun" of those people, we don't actually make fun of them because they manage that fine by themselves
I think natives should learn the language too and that's why I'm favour of obligatory courses in our national language in schools
However whether natives and immigrants choose to actually to use Norwegian is up to them
Fine by me
I think it would be great if more people started learning Sami, but from what little I have tried to learn it is pretty difficult
I think that is technically allowed, but I am not sure anyone has actually tried to go that route
It's one of the national languages, so it's their right
Although not necessarily in their best interests in the long run
it would not be very usefull in 99% of the country so, no
Edit: I see I need to think a bit before I post a comment, originnaly I wrote something like my response to u/biggestflower
But, I deleted it and put something blunt there that doesnt really reflect my opinon
Not only that, but you'll also lower wages, which is great for corporations but not so much for anyone else
Corporations love to exploit cheap foreign labour at the expense of natives
> We even have a show called "charterfever"
Do they still produce that
I haven't really watched TV for years
In what way
Ive noticed its gotten pretty common to mix in English with Norwegian lately
Also theres quite a lot of things there isnt a Norwegian word for, but there is in English
Especially related to technology
I havent really got an opinion on whether or not you need to learn norwegian to get citizenship
What I will say is that if you speak a Sami language it would defenetliy help you with showing an intrest in the country ect
So it is an advantage, just not something that will be very usefull outside of a few municipalities
It's better than exploitation, social dumping, lower wages and a lack of control of immigration
Maybe Danish in itself is ok, but the Danish number system can go and take a hike imho
If only we didn't get our Bibles from you, that might have been different
Lets just say there is a reason we decided that you could keep your number system and your pronunciation for yourself ...
School provided absolutely everything we needed
Base supplies (that we had to replace ourselves if we lost it), high quality paper, canvases, paints of all sorts, pencils, charcoal, literally everything
We were also given free access to the entire Adobe collection, could borrow camera equipment etc
Even though we were given every supply we needed, the art belonged to us, and we were free to do whatever we wanted with it
Some of my art is used as example material today (5 years since I graduated) and thus “belongs” to the school, but I doubt they’d care if I called them tomorrow and asked if I could get it back
Edit; we had to bring our own laptops and ensure they were healthy enough to run Adobe though
When I studied CS source code written as part of research, student tasks, term papers and degrees using any equipment that the University owned was considered the property of the University and should be published under a Creative Commons license
In reality that served to protect the research since no one could patent it and sell it
It makes sense with regard to CS, but not quite within arts
I don't think so, I gotta admit I don't know when, officially, the first day of spring even is
Maybe if we had a tradition like that I'd remember
I guess we don't really have a big need for a dedicated day for skipping school, considering that it feels like every May there is at least 1 day off every week
The only thing I know of with a similar premise is "Sun days", which we have in the north
When sunshine touches the school for the first time that year we get the day off
It's 1st of March
March, April and May are the spring months
In Norway the first day of spring is the first day when the average temperature is above 0, but below 10, and the trend is rising
And this will differ very much from say Stavanger to Alta
Stavanger has spring in February, while Alta will have to wait until April
Username checks out
This differs from place to place
February is spring in Stavanger, while March is still winter in Alta
Please stop with this nonsense
Education first, then homophobia
It's not nonsense
It's the meteorological seasons
But I agree that in our long country, it doesn't necessarily feel that way
After all, the meteorological seasons are just a made up definition
However, this definition is used by e. g. DNT
No, meteorological spring _in Norway_ starts when the temperature is above 0 and below 10, and the trend is rising:
It seems like we are both right
According to this source:
I en del sammenhenger, f.eks i klimatologiske oversikter som gjelder hele landet, bruker en gjerne årstider på tre måneder hver:
Vinter = desember, januar, februar
Vår = mars, april, mai
Sommer = juni, juli, august
Høst = september, oktober, november
Which is the same as the meteorological season in the English Wikipedia I quoted earlier
Although this is if you generalise for the whole country
If one were to look at when spring starts locally, one would use your definition
En meteorologisk (klimatologisk) definisjon på de fire årstidene i Norge baserer seg på normal døgnmiddeltemperatur
Årstidenes lengde er dermed ulik rundt om i landet
Den delen av året da døgnmiddeltemperaturen er over 10 ° C, er sommeren
Når den er under 0 ° C, er det vinter
Så er vår og høst mellom de to
Thank you for teaching me this
TIL
Yes
No worries
I know we humans like to generalize and standardize, but it simply does not work with seasons, and the 4 x "three month season" way of thinking really doesn't fit
Sorry for being a surpomp earlier on
Haha  no worries, I am a surpomp quite often as well
And I totally agree
4xseasons doesn't quite work
Where I'm from it can easily be 9 degrees and rain on 24th of December and 24th of July
You wouldn't know the difference except for the amount of daylight
Haha, yes exactly
You're from the north too, ey
Yes, I am :) my flair is supposed to say Norway, but ai got a bit confused now since you had to ask
I'm originally from Rogaland, but am currently living in Oslo
Depends on the neighbourhood and where geographically it is
Sometimes we don't get along with neighbours, because of how they behave
But sometimes we get our colleague's from work to live near us :)
No, I live in a town with 1100 people and I barely know anyone
That depends where you live
I grew up in a small village where everybody knows everybody
Visiting your neighbors is normal, and popping by unannounced is common
In the city however it's not common
In my apartment/house block of 12 people, there is lots of drama and competition
I keep out of it
> Can't speak for anywhere else though, I've lived in the same neighborhood all my life
I think that is the key
I grew up in a village where people have lived for generations
Half are related to each other and the rest you have known all your life

20 mins by car on a good day (+ kindergarden delivery)
My girlfriend however does 10 min walk and 7 mins by high speed boat which is kind of nice
The past two years it's been 3 seconds
Before that, in the winter either 1 min walk, 20 min bus, 5 min walk or 5 min walk, 10 min train, 10 min walk
In the spring/summer/fall, 30 min bike
30 minutes by train
Bus for 10 minutes, then a 20 minute subway ride
I like it
fifteen minute walk to uni
We're often outside at my [school] so it's usually a 15-20 min walk to the [gondola] and then a 5-10 min ride up to the mountain
I like the classic greek names, Anaximander, Aristophanes, Hippolyta, Eratosthenes, etc
They sound like gods, or ancient alien robot overlords or something
Arne means eagle btw
Jógvan (Faroese) is pretty cool to me
But it's common as muck apparently
This made me laugh more than it had any right to
This has changed over the years, when I was a kid the standard was to move out at 18, some went to school far away at 16 and just never moved back in because they ended up renting their own place or shared with someone
And some did more education and lived at home in between, maybe left at 25 the latest
Now it's becoming more and more common for people to stay at home up until their 30s, getting work and a reasonable place to rent is becoming more difficult
I feel that the average is getting higher and higher
It much depends on where you are, how lucky you’ve been getting a job and been able to save up, eventually how much your parents can support you getting your own home
Some are lucky with parents owning flats or/and have saved up for their kids to get out, many aren’t. Housing prices are ridiculous many places, especially in and around Oslo
Combined with a cooler labour market and youngsters aiming for high and long university degrees
In addition our government has taken measures to cool down the loan market and the housing market by setting bars for how much you can lend compared with your annual salary and savings
This has made it even harder for young people to get on the inside of the housing market, even giving property investors and rich people better conditions to invest in flats
It’s a given that people stay longer at home in general
It used to be normal to move out at 18-21, but today it’s more likely to be 25-30
I moved out shortly after turning 19, because I went to college in a town that was a little bit away and the commute was absolute shit
19 is fairly common, it's when people are finished with high school and start going to university, alternatively the military
I worked for a few years while living at home after high school though, so I didn't move out until I was 21
The average age to move away from home is [19 years old] and has not really changed much since 1950
Depends a lot on where u live
In the city, some even stay while studying and only move once they're done with that and found a job
In the countryside, some move when they start high school to not have an hour or more commute each way
I'm surprised by UK, but I guess many live at home until they are done with their studies
I moved out when I was 22 :) Right after high school
In 2018 I bought an apartment when I was 26 :) Thanks for the chart, quite interesting to see the differencees
>  and guys stay with their parents and bring their wife home
How interesting
I would think it would be the other way around - the women bringing their husband home (so that the daugther can take care of her parents when they grow old
MY second thought: people must live in very large houses
> This has changed over the years
It actually hasn't. The age of moving out has stayed almost the same since 1950
[Source]
Source for your last claim
Might be true, but that is not my impression at all
> I feel that the average is getting higher and higher
It's actually not
the age of moving out has not changed much since 1950
[Source]
I assume she didn't stay with him
If my husband kicked my child out that would definitely be a deal breaker
I'm sorry you had to go through that
> but I couldn't possibly live with my mother-in-law
I know
And she is even really nice
Not even sure if I would want to share house with my own mother
For perspective, Im talking early ninties vs 2010's and onward
[Aftenposten: Flere unge bor hjemme]
[NRK: Flere unge over 18 år bor hjemme]
I saw some number further up, can be many reasons why
But we can probably agree on the fact that it’s more difficult for younger people to establish themselves today compared to some decades ago, which again leads to many staying longer with their parents
The further north the earlier they leave home
(Here it's 19)
Up here people move away from home at the same time as in 1950 (at 19 years old on average)
But my parents build their house in the 70's before they turned 25
That is uncommon today
Couples usually buy a smaller apartment first, and then buy a larger house later on
In Oslo that’s pretty much impossible if your parents don’t own some flats already or have saved up money for you
Combined with a tough labour market, high rents and so on, it’s a given that the situation is like it is
It is only becoming worse since we do not put any real measures against it, only improving the possibilities for property investors to do their business
In Norway 77% of people own their home
In Oslo the number is 75%. So less of a difference than you might think
[Source]
But you have to agree that things have and are changing over the last decades, all factors considered, especially in the capital
*"I Oslo var vel 70 prosent eiere i 2001, sammenlignet med 76 prosent i 1990
"* [Source]
So it's better now compared to 2001
The difference is that among the poorest in Oslo fewer own their home
[Source] Which obviously is not good
Poor people in Oslo also need a secure living situation
I don’t know if this takes into account the many who owns a flat but then rent out rooms to others, while living in it themselves (or not)
Which is in my experience a more common way to live in Oslo now than before
You are right: *"I Oslo har vi de siste årene sett en nedgang i andelen som bor alene, spesielt i de indre bydelene
Dette er muligens drevet av de økende boligprisene og at noen av den grunn velger å bo sammen med andre for å redusere boutgiftene
Men fremdeles bor det bare én person i over halvparten av boligene i disse bydelene
"* [Source]
Okay
It’s anyway, as another Norwegian commented in this thread, a shift and generally more difficult in to get into the market, everything combined, as this source of yours also is a proof of
I don’t think we discuss or think of this seriously enough in Norway
I’m myself in this situation, 28, living outside of Oslo, with my parents, high degree, been difficult to get any job after the studies and thus also difficult to move out
I’ve several friends at same age in more or less same situation
Seems like the ones in power and the society in general, people who grew up when things were easier and have been used to a good, traditional lifestyle, don’t understand these problems and don’t think much about the future
They think everything will be like it used to be forever, that everything is just as easy for us as it was for them decades ago
Pretty frustrating
Norway tried to trade away a significantly portion of our oil fields for a 40% share of Volvo in 1978
However the shareholders of Volvo eventually rejected the negotiated deal, so nothing come out of it
I’m not sure if it has happened any other places, but during WWII a fascist named Vidkun Quisling tried to coup the nation using radio
Their largest city is called Johannesburg
Even though Johannes is used in Estonia, it is not a "Estonian name". It's a biblical name, common all over
Black metal
For some reason it's become the stereotype on the internet that all norwegians listen to black metal
Sure there are some bands here, but I know very few people who actually are black metal fans, or that even listen to it
Polar bears
wtf
The national frites usage goes drastically up during cyclocross/veldrijden season, right
But that’s not a stereotype that’s just straight fax

There is a collection of laws stemming from the older Gulathing of Norway, these were taken back to Iceland where they were used and legislated in their first Althing
As there is no written sources of these laws one can't be certain it's the exact same ones which were used
However Ari Thorgilsson wrote the  *Íslendingabók* which states that Úlfljótr brought with him the laws which were used in Gulathing, since he resided in norway for a few years, and as said above, those stem from that
Parliament is the legislative assembly of a country, not a building
If the Russian Parliament moved to Vladivostok, it would still be the Russian Parliament

I will never forget the disgusted look on my friend's face over breakfast in Germany
He thought he was getting regular apple juice

You'll find them in any grocery store in Norway atleast, usually a few different brands too
16 year olds have no clue about politics, I think the voting age should be raised to at least 20

Only ever have it for breakfast, when you also have time to cook eggs and bacon
Which is never haha, i eat while reading mail at work :)
Oh, and all hotel breakfasts have them
And here you would be scorned for keeping them on, even if you were the king
Probably
It's used for those things but only on special occasions
If I were to put up a flag on a normal Tuesday because I was happy I would be a weirdo
If I put it up on my birthday, liberation day or the national day that is normal or even expected
Although some might find it hard to admit, I will agree with you in that Scandinavians do use their flag quite similar to Americans use theirs
You will also see pennon flags all over they place even on ordinary days (although they appears to be more common in the summer half than the winter half of the year)
I don't really have an issue with it though
Yep
It was not an exhaustive list
[Tilslørte bondepiker]
Dronning Maud
(literally: Queen Maud)
This is really local to where I come from
When we gained independence from Sweden in 1905, our first long and queen were Kong Haakon and Dronning Maud
Once when they visited my home town, the local people wanted to do something special for their new queen and decided to make a new dessert
Dronning Maud (the dessert, not the queen) is almost a fromage
It is made of whipped cream and Kogel Mogel (egg and sugar whipped together)
To the mix, you add gelatin and then you lay down layers of the Cream and Kogel Moggel mix with rasped chocolate in between
Finish it of with generous sprinkle of chocolate
Let rest in the fridge for at least 4 hours, ideally over night to let the gelatin stiffen
You can also add a bit of port to the mix if you want to
This dessert is served at all family gatherings in my family and I love to introduce new people to it
It is getting more known in Norway in general, but it is still a bit of a hidden treasure
Here is the recipe in Norwegian if anybody wants to make it themselves:
Definitely [Kvæfjord cake] It's repeatedly been voted for as the worlds best cake (in norway)
[Queen Maud fromage] comes in at a close second for me
Jeg liker kvæfjordkake (verdens beste) bedre da
Queen maud pudding is a fromage BUT it is VERY inportant to never call it a fromage
Ja det også er en høydare, det er helt klart
Yes
I just call it Dronning Maud to avoid the whole issue
Spiseskje (tablespoon)
Måtte Google, men ja

That the vikings did their whole raiding thing because they were "evil" or something like that
In truth it was mostly because of the scandinavian inheritance system in which the oldest son got all of his father's land
The younger brothers were able to settle new land for a good while, but it came to the point where there was no good land left
This made them look outwards for new land to settle and farm
That Sweden annexed us in 1814
That was Carl Johan’s goal, but after a war in 1814 we agreed that Norway and Sweden should share the same kings and have the same foreign policy
We still had our own military and our own Parliament and constitution
We were basically two kingdoms with the same king
Newspapers from back in the 1800s often referred to the union as "the kingdoms of Sweden and Norway", while not separating us entirely from one another
This isn't something anyone outside of Norway gives a shit about, but here goes
On the 17th of May every year, we celebrate our independence day
Or rather, we celebrate our constitution day which I think people mix together
In 1814 Norway gained it's independence from Denmark and as one of the first countries in the world we got our own constitution
It's the second part we're actually supposed celebrate and for good reason
The reason Norway got independent in 1814 was because Denmark was allied with napoleon and as part of the peace treaty were forced to hand Norway over to Sweden
Right after this decision was made, there were a few months where Norway had seceded from Denmark but not yet been annexed by Sweden
A bunch of nerds noticed this and were like "holy shit you guys we're independent we gotta make a constitution ASAP then Sweden can't take us". So they made a constitution and then Sweden came and annexed us anyway a few months later
People will also say that "actually we went into a union with Sweden". Well this union was agreed on after Sweden went to war with Norway and killed a bunch of people who said no
Doesn't sound like a union of equals to me
Vikings were barbarians
Some bandits were barbarians and raided and pillaged
The rest of the 80% of people were traders and farmers
I heard somewhere that Alex simply didn't want to conquer sparta, as opposed to that he was't able to
Also, they didn’t always sail out to raid
Often they traded or were contracted mercenaries
Guns
Norwegian here can confirm we also have juleøl (christmas beer)
We also have christmas mead
We have our own Christmas beers, but the tradition seems to be a direct Danish import
We even celebrate J-Day in the same way, with Tuborg Christmas hats
we have Gløg, which is kinda supposed to be mulled wine which you drink with nuts and raisins in the gløg. we have christmas beer too, but gløg is definetly the most prevelant since even kids can drink it
And [julebrus]
Julebokk
We have lots of different kinds of juleøl. I used to go to tasting parties and we'd rate all the different types and compare our rating to what they had in the various papers
Good fun :-)
No, it's just a basic soda
Julmust is sold in Norway as a julebrus though
Julmust is something rather
special
Where can you get julmust in Norway (besides IKEA)
Tror det varierer litt:
Yes, relatively common
Norwegian building codes dictate that all new houses must have a chimney
This doesnt apply if the main heating in the building uses underfloor water heating OR is built using the norms for energy effective houses
(TEK 17 passive energy housing)
Before this we hade more strict rules following the TEK10 building codes that mandated all newly built houses to have atleast 2 sources of heating where one of them commonly was a wood stove
These rules were relaxed in favor of a ban on using fossilized fuelsources and more energy efficient buildings
Source:  [  (in norwegian)
Pretty common yes, I usually help my father chop wood in the spring, then it dries over the summer and is used mostly in the winter, in the summer only for heating up the sauna
It's not common to use it as *primary* heating outside cabins
It's *very* common to have a fireplace as a little extra
My house has two fireplaces, one of them in my bedroom
NRK's slow TV show where they showed a fireplace burning (8 hours), before that there was a dedicated 4 hour show just on firewood
Also TV2 showed us how to correctly stack the firewood when storing it ([link] not sure if it works outside of Norway)
Pretty much every house has a fireplace, and every cabin has one
As primary heating
I don't think I've ever seen any houses outside cabins or really old buildings use anything but electric ovens/heat pumps or district heating and only use wood ovens as a supplement
> Norwegian building codes dictate that all new houses must have a chimney
I didn't know that
Can't you switch it to heating
Our air-to air heat pump works as an air conditioner if I hit the reverse button
So in winter it gets the heat in, and in summer gets the heat out
(Not that I have ever needed the airconditioning function
Really
That’s what my family, and mostly everyone I know use
Yeah, this confuses me too
My parents live on an old farm, but they have several ovens (hva faen er oljeovn på engelsk
) dotted around the house for heat
The fireplace is just for cozying up the living room
I think they did use to have forests, then the Vikings used most of the wood for heating
>Nuclear can be negative
How
Well, I'm terribly happy we got a lingua franca out of it atleast
Just imagine how impossible the global economy today would have been if not for most of the world speaking english
And without the globalization we have today, there would have been a lot more war going on, since it would still be profitable
You could say it was a necessary evil ;)
Well, I've been thought it's the brits
Just think about this, in 1913, the british empire controlled 23% of the world population
And 24% of the land area in 1920
Even if you discount america, places such as Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, Australia, Canada speak English because of the empire, and many has it as an official language
Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Shizuoka, Fuji, Nagoya,Nagano, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Kobe, Okoyama, Himeji, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Saga(n?), Kumamoto, Kagoshima, Naha, Naruto, Chiba, Saitama, Nikko, Fukushima, Sendai, Niigata, Aomori, Hakodate, Sapporo
I've learned all the prefectures, and I know that some (a lot) of them are also names of cities, but not exactly which ones
\- Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Yokohama, Fukuoka in general
\- Sapporo and Nagano, because of the Winter Olympics
\- Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for the nuclear bombardments
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Nagaoka, Hiroshima, Kawasaki, Obama
I'll try my best, though I don't watch tha much anime so I'm at a disadvantage
Then again, I'm interested in geography so maybe not
I'll try saying what I think when I think about that city
Kyoto (Civ 6 capital for Japan)
Tokyo (Capital)
Nagoya
Fukushima (nuclear disaster)
Hiroshima (Nuked)
Nagasaki (Nuked)
Aomori (Recent Kento Bento vid)
Akita (Recent Kento Bento vid)
Fukuoka (That big city in the south)
Gifu (That other decently sized city I don't know why I know of
Osaka (That giant city that isn't Tokyo)
Sapporo (Biggest city in Hokkaido)
Fuji (Mount Fuji)
Naha (That big city on those islands in the south (Okinawa))
Hiroshima, Fukushima, Nagasaki, Tokyo, Kyoto
Aaaaand thats about it
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Kobe, Sapporo
Sapporo is somewhat known here due to winter sports
They usually host cross country skiing and other skiing disciplines events
Only reason I've heard of it
Pretty much all documentaries i watch are in English, of the recent ones i have seen it's these two who stand out, David Attenborough and Brian Cox
For my own country
i don't know, i really can't say anyone which stands out
I have seen a few of the Attenborough documentaries in Norwegian on our state channel NRK, then the voice has been that of Frode Stang
That said, i had never heard of him until i had to search it up now
He was my first thought when I read this question
He is not informal
He is formal head of ruling party
He is informal leader of Poland itself tho
Wikipedia is partially correct
It starts with the hebrew name of Elisjeba
This became Elisabet in Scandinavia, then shortened to Else in Denmark and Norway, Elsa in Sweden
Now go do nothing useful with this tidbit of knowledge
Yes
We just use toast machines
Usally good non white bread, ham cheese and ketchup, somtimes onion/paprika :)
Called ostesmørbrød (lit
"cheese butter bread") here in Norway
Yes, we just call them toast
Ham and cheese is standard and I use oregano and some other spices on mine
It's what I eat for breakfast most days
I don't use a pan though, but rather a "toastjern", basically a machine to press it together
Money and fish :)
>We are the only EU member to invest billions into saving its national airline's which nobody wants
If you look at attempts at establishing airlines in Italy, almost all fail:
- Alitalia has failed multiple times
- Air Italy was backed by Qatar Airlines and still failed
- Norwegian Air tried to establish a base flying long haul to the US and within Europe and they failed (long before their current problems started)
It seems like it's simply not possible to have a profitable airline in Italy
And we provide a lot of natural gas to several European countries
...And we had a traitor so bad his last name became a noun in English
Also, thank you for Carlsberg and Lego
"Level up", I like that
Unfortunately,  some countries are levelling up into end game bosses
I am looking at you, Victor Orban
Edit: spelling
But Itlay you get 94 million visitors every year
Alitalia / Air Italy should be able to get a couple of those
Many other European countries are good at trains, but also have profitable airlines
My autocorrect bungled "Victor Orban". Fixed it now
No no, not at all
I'm definitely not qualified to say anything about italian trains so I trust what you say :)
Hey Italy
Stop giving Germany ideas again
We drank all our D2O and ate all our iron
Nothing to see here
The oil is fake news
Vidkun Quisling obtained what few others have achieved: His name became synonymous with [traitor]
Quisling is our most well-known traitor, while the most insidious, cruel and harmful one was probably Henry Rinnan
His people, the "Rinnan Band", infiltrated the Norwegian resistance as well as recruiting to several false "resistance" movements
They also made secret arrests and engaged in torture of civilians and resistance fighters
He was executed by firing squad at the end of the war
The lieutenant in charge finished him off with two shots to the head at close range - ostensibly as a coup de grace, possibly for the pleasure of killing the little motherfucker himself
There was a saying "there are 10 uslings in 1 Quisling". Usling is an "ussel" person, a person with bad thoughts and actions
I didn't know people knew him outside of Norway
Because of the needs of the german war industry, the use of metals like copper and nickel were rationed
Therefore the nazi government printed one and two kroner on paper instead of coins
Lesser change was made of iron and zinc
The people nicknamed the two kroner bill a "quisling" and the one kroner was called a "usling" hence the expression there are two uslings in one quisling
Me neither
Rather surprising
Thanks for clearing that up
Norway, having social benefits on the more generous part of the scale compared to other countries, invest a lot of time and money in making sure that this is not abused
For example by making sure that receivers of said benefits does not just take the money to Poland, Spain or whatever, but that you are supposed to be close to where you live so that you can receive the necessary help to get you off those benefits (medical treatment, job search help ++)
They, as in the state, are not shy of prosecuting you if they believe you do not follow these rules
Well, it turns out that the EEA rules regarding free flow of goods, services etc
, across borders also covers benefits received from the state, after a change in 2012
The result
Of course, people have been prosecuted and even jailed (36 cases of the latter this far discovered), when they were within their rights to do so
Massive shitshow
And the best thing: every proof points out that they knew about it, NAV, the government, ministers, everyone
The EFTA court even had a comment years ago about it and questions were raised, but dismissed in “the system”. I can’t believe our courts didn’t look into it, but took it as given, maybe the price of having general competent courts with tight budgets
It is so clear when you see it against the EEA/EU principles
It had been discussed in the parliament back in 2012
It was said to be very complicated, until a lawyer looked at it, then it wasn’t. It’s just another field where Norway don’t want to obey to our international obligations, we think we know best, we think we do best, always
The denying nowadays, that they didn’t knew, that they did what they could, that no one wants to take the blame
Yes, massive shitshow
You can't just throw that out there without linking the video, my man
what i seriously don’t get is how people like this allow people to film them
like it’s going to get leeked if it exists so just don’t let people film you
Yup
Hauglie probably have to leave her post as minister of Labor, but I doubt any real blame will be placed in the end
Labor (party, not department) was in charge in 2012 and the conservatives today, neither want to rock the boat so to say
If Labor was not involved I’m guessing they would hammer this case more, now they leave it up to Social Left and Reds
I think the problem is deeper than who were in position at that time
There’re many here who are possible to blame, but the ones who sit in positions now and have been watching this lately clearly have to take some responsibility
I can see this raise questions about if we need better routines and systems in the future, but I doubt they’ll dig that much for someone on benefits
Had some slivovica in Serbia, that stuff is awesome
Blew the liquor quota on the way home
Whenever i travel through western Norway and come across fjords and valleys with dialects that i literally can not understand
My mind is  like "We speak the same language
What the hell
I should be able to understand you
What is this
I remember when i was a kid and we were going on a fishing trip with my dad to Hitra and this was in the early 2000's before gps and google maps
We stopped in the valley of Surnadal and my dad went to ask some local who was at at a strawberry stand the way and i watched him talking to the guy for five minutes and gesticulating wildly before coming back to the car
I asked him if he got the right directions and he just said "I have no idea what he said
lets just get to the next gas station and buy a map
I live in western Norway
Whenever I travel to Oslo I can't help but feel like an outsider due to the accent differences
He couldn't be Norwegian
we do 90% of the time
Just some valleys where so inaccessible that even the 300 year danish reign failed to impact the local language
If you learn standard norwegian you will do fine
The problem lies within my/our awkward reaction and instead of asking "what the hell are you saying
" We just smile and nod our head
I'm sure if i would have been honest and told him that i do not understand he would modify his dialect to suit you
I think i can explain a little, though i am from the northern midlands (northern norway)
We can generally understand eachother at a mostly fluent level, but some dialects are so far from your own it takes a bit of time to get used to the special words and pronounciations that it will sometimes be inelligible unless the person speaks slowly and clearly
For a native this will most often be understandable, but in the small valleys and fjords it can be a problem,  but just tell people what words you dont understand and they can generally translate it into a more common Norwegian word, og even English og necessary
Don't they speak german/a German esq language in parts of alsace and Lorraine
Tusen takk
Du er velkommen her
Vi er glad i folk som liker oss så mye at de lærer språket vårt
Thats good ! Just dont bother peopke on the buss
In Norway we call it "Forsvaret", which translates to "the defence".
The main subdivisions are Hæren - the army, Sjøforsvaret - the oceandefence, Luftforsvaret - the airdefence and Heimevernet - the homeprotection
In norway its called the "forsvarsdepartementet" or in english "the departementet og defens
Looks like the definition of ministry is a department led by a minister, which would explain the English
I hate skiing
This is genuinely hard for me to admit, but I can't ski that well because of a problem I have with my ankle
&#x200B;
This is also kind of hard to admit, but I like the Swedes
Please don't tell them
I eat dinner for breakfast
In fact I eat dinner for every meal
I really don't like bread cereal and so on
I can't roll my r, and guttural R is truly a national shame tbh, disgusting asf to listen to
I don't like Brunost/brown goat cheese
My physics are fairly norwegian thoe, but I lost my blonde hair when I was around ten years old
Believe that's all tbh
I hate skiing
I don't want to go skiing and I don't want to watch our sportspeople skiing
Winter sports in general are terrible and boring
I don't really know how to ski
I mean, I get the basics of it, I'm just not good at it
I'm a bad Norwegian
Hello officer
This comment right here
Men hva faen
I've never tried it
Yeha, the ski-slope refers to a cheese looking like [this] after being cut
OP is a monster
Yup
wat
Please don't ever come to scandinavia
I have no clue tbh, probably will be soon
We need a travel ban
As you should
Do you at least snowboard
Nope
Yeah i like snow, but i hate the ice, so winter isnt exactly my favorite time of the year
"Ta en spansk en" - take a Spanish one
Doing something not entirely by the books
"Du store kineser", which literally translates to "You big Chinese (Chinese as in the demonym)", is used to express surprise
You don't hear it too often anymore, but I'm sure most Norwegians know the meaning of it
Note: you don't say this *to* a person as if you were calling them a big Chinese (person)
Svenske tilstander - Swedish conditions
Contemporary politicized expression used to describe all that's perceived wrong with Swedish politics, from a right-leaning point of view
Particularly referring to immigration, crime, and political correctness
Det er helt gresk for meg -- Its completely Greek for me (I don't understand any lf this)
Det er helt Texas -- Its completely Texas (Go crazy)
How about "Det viktigste er ikke å vinne, men å slå svenskene" - The most important thing is not to win, but to beat the swedes
An old one that’s sadly fallen out of favor: Sint som en tyrk -> Angry as a Turk
I love this
I like the Spanish
Very astute
What is stigmatised in other countries, but not in yours
Or vice versa
For example I recently talked with a German exchange student who said that he admired that we here always speak our dialect, and that speaking your dialect in Germany is (somewhat) stigmatised
You can of course also answer for other countries if you have knowledge
Oh, this one's easy
Whaling
For the most part completely uncontroversial in Norway
Seemingly very much so outside our borders (with some exceptions)
Whale meat
Damn
Didn’t know it was a thing that it’s considered rude
I don’t get how it’s rude
I though it was mostly in Britain/US that is wasn't accepted
It's not that common in Norway any more except in sausage, but that's mostly because there are so few horses nowadays
We call the prime minister and king with informal addressing
They're known by their first name
Did you ask him why he considers whale meat so much worse than beef
Our PMs are often just referred to by their first name
Jens and Erna being the two most recent ones
What do/did you do when the pack horse and such that got to old to work or injured though
We didn't breed horses for food here either, but they are/were considered good food when you didn't have a use for them any longer
Except the whales that Norway hunts aren't rare (minke whales)
And they're not farmed
Oh, that is such a good question
I would love to see a good documentary about Bulgaria
And Hungary
And Portugal
Traditional food, like eating sheep's heads
There is barely even any  food there aswell
I would say probably the "russefeiring
" From May 1st (some places starting even in april), high school seniors basically have an endless party that culminates with the constitution day parade on May 17th
In this period they dress up in onepiece-like suits and hats in different colors, traditionally red for regular studies, blue for economical or trade studies and black for vocational studies
Students tend to join into groups where each group buys and decorates an old van or bus, has a theme and stick together during the period
Some students, mainly from the western parts of the Oslo metro area, can spend tens of thousands of euros each on the "russefeiring
" They also have "knuter," which is a list of various challenges that will earn you a knot or a token in your hat
The challenges can vary from fairly innocent ones to more sinister
Some examples:
\- wear breadloafs as shoes a whole day in school (piece of bread in the hat)
\- finish 24 beers in 24 hours (beercap)
\- Have safe sex on the school premises (pencil)
\- Kiss a police officer (Sherrif's star)
And a few days after this is finished, it's time for finals
As far as I can see no Norwegian have answered, so my nomination will be [Russefering] which everyone besides Norwegians think is just weird and a huge waste of money
We watch that sketch on December 23
Studenten (whcih I assume is what you are referring to from Sweden) is quite different
Both are celebrations of the end of secondary school, but only the Norwegian one have the insane partying and money use associated with it
Okay
I'm not familiar with your tradition here, but if it is like the Norwegian one then I will also nominate yours for this thread
In Norway, that's always shown the day before Christmas Eve at 21:00 hours
He bakes a mean knekkebrød though
He had a symbol he liked to use, one of the old Indian ones I think, you could get a tattoo of that along with his name
I don't know
The fact that we decided to demolish so many historic buildings was very foolish if you ask me
Other than that I'm not sure if we have done anything particularly foolish
Going to overthrow England before the French attempted, ended up loosing a king and the French came three days after and cleaned up and got a sick island in addition
When someone in Norway find something from the Viking age, he has to pay the archeological survey, which is basically a recipe to let vanish the past
And this practice is continuing
You did end up on the winning side though, so it's probably less dumb than joining the war because the Brits stole your navy and then losing because the Brits stole your navy
I like [Ukraine's] 2004-2015 plates for their creative use of the flag's colors on the nationality identification portion on the far left
Comparatively, the ugliest plates are Norway's plates for 2 seater vans/station wagons of a certain volume and under 3500 kg total weight
They are green with black letters/numbers
I got a small van with green plates
I like the British and Icelandic ones
The British ones are yellow but look nicer than the Dutch because of bigger letters and a different shade of yellow
I love that Iceland displays their flag, it shows that they don't like the EU, just like us
Wow, they get letters and numbers that match the colour of the car
Oslo
A lot has happened the last 20 years, and there’s still a lot more to come
There’s a lot of new development
I’m from Oslo and I’ve always loved Oslo, but it’s a more interesting place to visit now
It used to be a bit more dull
Still has a lot of untapped potential though
Yeah, the number of skyscrapers compared to Krakow was noticeable
r/lfg
I’d assume you have “heat pumps” pretty commonly around in Sweden too
Those can also run as air condition during summer, except like no one I know uses the setting
New houses and flats like mine has central air systems and that circulates both cold and hot air depending on what temperature it’s set on, which also works like air condition
In my experience Norwegian at least don’t really use the term “air condition” (except for in cars) or talk about using anything to cool down houses during summer, so maybe that’s the same in Sweden too
Their gonna need it now that their pm want’s to try herd immunity
What guy
The guy who was interviewed by Norwegian TV2
Maybe that was just propaganda
The Guardian also [wrote about it]
On Sunday night, Tegnell told Swedish TV the outbreak would “calm down” in May but return in the autumn
“It will be important how much of the population is infected,” he said
“It will determine what happens in the autumn
” Coronavirus could be stopped either by “herd immunity, or a combination of immunity and vaccination”, he said
“It’s basically the same thing
Right, That must have been what I heard on TV2, I sort of just grabbed an article about it to be honest
So you're right he has backed out of it, still concerning though
I am sure the experts know what they are doing, the guy in charge here is Bent Høie
He used to manage hotels, So I wouldn't call him a public health expert
In the US the VP Mike Pence is in charge of the corona task force
These guys are not experts, you need to ask yourself if they listen to the experts they work with
A group of professors at Karolinska institutet & Chalmers started a protest-list, which over 2000 Swedish scientists from academia have signed
But I do wish you the best and I hope you can get it under control
Z isn't used a lot in the first place
If a letter comes after z in the word then I'll write it with a line one the middle
If the letter is the last in the word then I won't put a line through it
I write Z with a line in the middle, because in math, it could otherwise be confused for the number 2 if I write sloppily
For the same reason, I write a line in the middle of the number 7 to avoid confusion with the number 1
And I write write capital I (in math) with bars over and under to avoid confusion with 1
And for the number 2, i write a small loop at the bottom left - again to avoid confusion with Z. And to avoid confusion between 5 and S, I write 5 in two strokes
This is my own style, which developed over years at school and at university, as I had to write more and more math faster and faster
Same here for both Z, W, Q, X and C
Yes, given second names as middle names are somewhat common, depending on your other first name and how well they fit together
Many have their mother’s last name as a middle name as well
Yeah, and I think I know like 20 people with Sofie/Sophie as a middle name
My mom has three first names which doesn't really go well together
And when she was married to my dad, she had two last names, too
She only uses two first names, one in her home town, one where she lives now
Here it somewhat depends on where in Norway you come from
In North of Norway it is common to have a double first names, sometimes with a hyphen in between
And they use both
Most of my family on my mothers side have a second name, but we don't use it
But on my fathers side it is not that common
And they are from the south-east
So in Oslo I feel it is about 50/50 if they have a second name
Very very common
But what about their last name after the fact
Example being Olga Fedorovna (patrynomic) Yarlmenko
She would never be addressed using the last name
What if you don’t know the persons patronymic name
So interesting
Thank you for this response
Haha funny enough I actually do speak Polish
But this is still super informative
Saying "best thing since sliced bread". That idiom doesn't make any sense at all
How they are so scared of just being American and feeling a need to hyphenate and find some sort of nationality through genetics or outdated country customs
Ok the flip side of things they are also fervently proud to be American and it's the greatest place ever
This is a Norwegian thing, too
It dinged my fucking 2 week old car (new to me, very good condition Touran R-line Exclusive Edition, my first grown-up car)
I was furious when I discovered the dent
Norwegians have become too rich and selfish the later years
Saw someone say they didn't know how much fabric they got because the guy told them in feet when apparently they were used to yards
It took me a solid 10 seconds before I realized they can't just convert it on the fly as easily as metric can
Because presliced bread is shit bread
I know where it comes from and how it's used
But the idiom suggest that pre-sliced bread is a good thing and since Norwegians aren't fond of pre-sliced bread at all the idiom just doesn't work for us
We don't put our flag on things like the McDonalds logo, but it's the same wierd patriotolism here around food, norwegian salmon etc
Used to be very normal having small norwegian flags on the Christmas tree aswell
No, I was agreeing with the comment above
I do get the idea of short traveled food, but here in Norway it has been proven to be a lie
Salmon being  [sent to china for packaging and then back]
Short traveled also does not mean Climate-friendly,  E.g. spanish tomatoes leave a smaller carbon footprint than greenhouse grown localy in Norway:  [
Yeah, there is there is definetly some good things that are short traveled
But, as with the sammon, "short traveled" can be a direct lie, and its more of a marketing gimmick, Im starting to lose trust in all of these markings claiming things are fair trade/short traveled etc
[Vennesla library]
[Barcode] Oslo
The library in Tønsberg, Norways oldest town, built in 1992 over the ruins of Olavsklosteret (The convent of St
Olav)
Some of the ruins are inside the library, some are outside across the street
[Tønsberg og Færder bibliotek]
[Olavsklosteret]
And the [new Deichmanske main library]
The building it replaced, from 1933, was beautiful, [especially inside] But it was cleverly designed that you could not get from any point in the building to any other point without going up or down stairs
Gorgeous but very very impractical
Barcode and the [Opera House] are good, the new [Munch Museum] is really bad
Yeah, I never liked that one
The original design of the Munch Museum, with more glass on the facade, was much more graceful
Sometime shortly before construction began, it was decided that so much glass would be too expensive to maintain and would not be environmentally sound (if I remember correctly, it would make heating and cooling the building too expensive and resource intensive)
So new cladding was needed
Unfortunately they made a terrible choice
[What we were promised versus what we got
] Opinions may differ on the original - I quite liked it - but I think there's pretty broad agreement that the actual building is butt ugly
More uniform economic policies and regulations, and a more integrated European military
That would at least make sense on the international stage these days
Less reliance on the US, and the abolishment of tax havens within Europe
As long as we're not part of it, you can become the USE by all means
Czech railways were really good in my experience
Mostly because you had Urquell on tap on the train
There's already Elsa

And last time i cheched wasnt frozen supposed to take place in norway, or am i missing something
The snow queen
Wasnt it only inspired by it
Isnt the book about an evil snow queen or smth
And from my research, its not inspired by austria at all
The scenery of the kingdom was inspired by Bergen and other elements from other norwegian towns, not a single mention about Austria in any of these websites
Edit: Nvm, found a website that said parts of the main town was inspired by a town in austria
We learnt about it, yes
Yes, we did learn about the winter war in School here in Norway, but it wasn't until much later in life that I understood how amazing the Finnish victory really was
Talk about winning against all odds
And of course you have Stalin's finger - and yes, I know it is a myth, but it is a cool one ;) hehe
Oh yeah, we get a page or two about it
The war is mentioned in my book, but my teacher told us to skip that part
Mentioned as a prelude to ww2, along with the Spanish civil war, I think
There is a fell voice on the air
That is a very good question, and I'm not old enough to remember, but I have done a little research (hopefully better this time
) and have found the following:
The Norwegian population in general sided wholeheartedly with the Finns, and 895 Norwegians served in a Swedish organisation called "Svenska Frivillegkåren" who fought on the Finnish side
Some of the most famous members of the Norwegian resistance during WW2 were in this group
Also, money were raised among Norwegians as well as supplies were gathered and sent to support the Finns
In one day alone during a ski sports event in Holmenkollen some 50 000 pairs of shoes, 100 000 rucksacks filled with supplies (food, tobacco, mittens, scarves etc
) and 16 000 woolen blankets were collected and sent to Finland
Weapons (mostly Krag-Jørgensen rifles) were also sent
The Norwegian author and Nobel Price winner Sigrid Unset donated her Nobel price to the Finnish fight in January 1940
The Norwegian government donated in secrecy 12 German 7
5 cm m/01 field cannons along with 7 166 artillery shells in february 1940
Norway also secretly permitted transit of military aircrafts to Finland through Sola airfield
Around 1 000 Finnish refugees were also received and cared for when they crossed the northern border between Finland and Norway
So, I believe you can safely say that the Norwegian people were firmly on  Finland's side in this conflict
You're right, I see
Before the real warfare started though
Norway was invaded April 9th 1940, so the things I described all happened before the invasion
Of course that changed everything, and as I said - many of the near 900 people who went to Finland to fight returned to Norway to fight the Germans and some of them are legendary war heroes
And any aid to Finland through Norway was made impossible, since Sweden rather quickly closed their borders towards Norway after Norway was invaded since the Swedes were neutral during WW2
So not only did Norway have enough on their own plate after the invasion, but the Swedes put an effective halt to whatever was going on between Norway and Finland already
The [Nidaros Cathedral] is probably the most well known building in Norway
One of the most beautiful buildings in all Norway in my opinion, if not the most beautiful
The [stavechurches] are also very impressive
Built in the middle ages, they were build by supporting wood, and without nails
The estimates are that 1000 to 2000 such churches existed in the middle ages
Only 28 are left
The Troll A plattform is insane, but because it was moved to the North Sea and today is mostly underwater, it does not get much attention
And I am amazed by what they could build out of timber 800 years ago
The stave churches are a good example of that [
It might not look so impressive today, but thinking this was built when Christianity first came to Norway - right after the Viking age - I find interesting
The stave churches
They're big, beautiful and they're built without nails
[You're not alone]
It certainly was something, lots of WW2-era tanks and cold war-era missiles and such on display in a historical fortress, then further on in there were dinosaurs
Big ben
Isn't that just the name of the bell
what was the deal with the dinosaurs though
Found a 2006 survey from a newspaper
The bottom three were
Phonesales (14%)
Doorsales (9%)
Realtor (9%)
On the other end we have
SAR pilot (9%)
Firefighter (8%)
Doctor (8%)
Parking guards, phone sellers, debt collectors
Same in Norway
I don't mind, they provide good content
Also, a free broadcasting service which makes content gives acting and entertainment jobs to Norwegians instead of making them have to go abroad to work in media
It's like crowd sourcing media entertainment so that we can provide a steady monthly service to those in an otherwise risky industry
Can't complain
Yeah, the first three are those who is most disliked, while the last three are those most liked
Oh absolutely
They need to rescue skiers, base jumpers and avalanche victims in the harshest mountain sides and weather conditions
Imagine hovering above a mountain with only meters to spare between the rotors and the cliff face
Or landing in the snow when the rotors whirl up the snow to near zero visibility
Those guys are something else, I can tell you that
Last summer my mother had lost her bag on one the trains
And only minutes after she had left the train a guy from the lost and foud called her
She did not have a name tag or anything on the bag, but the guy had gone thru her documents in the bag looking for contact info and had found it
Only thing the guy wanted was a 3€ fee, which had to be paid in cash

Worst thing is that adherents of both extremely polarized political parties cried about what horrible injustice he supposedly faced
Trump supporters support anything Trump says and don't like Americans being sentenced abroad, and prominent democrats called it racism and received a surprising amount of support in the narrative that Sweden somehow is much more racist than the US
And then the media with the inhuman conditions you mentioned
average Americans I thought was sane went completely bananas
Now I want a stronger EU to distance ourselves from lunacy
> (we dont have bail and whats the point with bail when a rich person can just pay the bail and flee the country
I don't see the point of bail even if the person has no plans of leaving the country
I find it mind boggling that someone came up with a legal system only benefiting the wealthy part of the population
I remember this vividly, it was a shitshow
At some point someone leaked the documents relevant to the case, interviews, evidence reports etc
It was all in Swedish so i had a look through a lot of it, and what became aparent is that the Victim was propably on drugs, his friend actually said they were at the kiosk to buy hashish
He had harrassed the group that included ASAP Rocky, they were constantly asking him to leave but he came back several times
At one point an altercation happens, not clear as who started it as both sides blame the other, but a pair of headphones belonging to the Afghan guy (victim) were thrown away, and thats when the guy punches the body guard
Again, ASAPS Crew move away
The Afghan guy keeps following them now claiming hes entitled to a compensation for the headphones, A girl comes and asks whats going on, also mentioning that the Afghan guy had harrassed her friend at an earlier date, some discussion happens between the parties and shit goes down, at one point involving some glass beer bottles
Now, both parties are guilty of crimes, I can only guess the reason ASAPS crew didn't want to push charges as they might be obligated to show up in court (bad idea when you're on a world tour)
So, the best advice in situations like theese: Move along, don't give these sort of people attention
You might slip and end up doing something you regret, even how much you beleive the other part deserves it
Well
I hear a lot of stories from during WW2 when we had no (real) coffee over here
Made a lot of people unhappy
(But we had fish, fish oil and potatoes, so we did not die)
But I do agree with the Swiss government - rather stock pile for instance life saving medicine, instead of coffee
First time I hear this, so apparently non-news over here
What are others saying
I don't doubt for a second that there are quite a few people who would literally consider "stop force feeding" the same as "murder" - religion does wonky shit to people's minds
Edit: mad catholics itt
I think this is great
I don't know where the idea came from that it is harmfull for children to watch butchering
Yet it never harmed a single farm kid (or hunter's kid) who grew up with it
My personal opinion is that every child should kill and gut a fish they fished themselves at least once during their childhood
Glass houses, etc
- although if correcting for size, it's closer to "People in crystal doll houses should not throw planets
> A Chinese woman (I think the mother of the family) was rolling around on the ground, wailing, at the feet of the policeman
Reminds me of an TV-episode from one of the airports in Australia
A Chinese woman is bringing in illegal food (fresh fruit I think), and she made such a scene completely out of proportion with the situation at hand
Makes you wonder if making a scene in China makes people do as you ask just to make you behave normally again
Certainly an interesting part of their culture
Edit: seems like I was right
[Sort of
> A Chinese woman (I think the mother of the family) was rolling around on the ground, wailing, at the feet of the policeman
I didn't know there were any Chinese pro footballers
[Turns out adult Chineese ladies throwing a tantrum is more common than you might think
The Swedish government would never escalate the situation to a diplomatic issue, the tourists themselves might try getting media attention but the government would, at most, only vaguely comment that they are "looking into the case" and deny further comment
Every child should fish their own fish, and then kill and gut it
At least once during their childhood
(..is my personal opinion
Ha ha, yeah
I remember that show
If they weren't bringing in fresh produce or live animals, they were bringing in tons of cash hidden in their clothes
Yeah, his lawyer even specifically denied it if I remember correctly, but the garbage article from TMC has still not been corrected
> "at will" employment
What do you mean
So it's basically a voluntary tax, in a country that don't like taxes
Which is another interesting aspect of it
And they would have so much more money if they tried instead to work on lowering the re-incarceration rate
But that is a whole different story
Tantrums are rarely useful when dealing with border control

Because it actually is: The American political spectrum is basicly centre to right compared to the European spectre
The Norwegian "Right" party: \*Høyre\* is centre to left compared to US politics

That

That is encouraging to hear
(The older ones wont live forever

And (although this hurts my soul to say): Swedish
In speech, yes there is a huge difference, not as much in writing though
The Scandinavian dialect continuum has a large difference in pronounciation, F.ex
[this site] shows an audio sample of different Norwegian dialects
If you click on one of the black dots on the map you can hear the same few sentences spoken by a person from that area
Two of the most noticeable differences is the use of guttural vs
uvular R, and palatalisation
Well, saying it's huge is probably hyperbolic, but when you compare the tonality, hard/soft consonants, monophthongs turning into diphthongs, R-pronounciation, wide -ld and -rd, I'd say that yes, the basic language is very similar, these small details add up to make the languages (and the dialects within them) very different in speech, from the eyes of a person who speaks neither language
Of course a person who speaks one of them will easily see the similarities, but I wasn't arguing against that
Furthermore I meant that the extremes are far from each other (f.ex
a Norrlending vs a Dane from rural Jutland), but you are right that from a foreign point of view, f.ex
Scanian sounds very similar to Danish
Finland, they definitively exist
If I see anyone mentioning a hot potato or kamelåså in regards to the Danish language, it's an instant downvote
If you make surrender jokes about France, I automatically picture you as an uneducated hillbilly who fucks his sister
Sweden
The hate it gets from some places is both absurd and offensive
Our scandinavian brothers mainly
We're all so similar, and have such an intertwined history that I feel like 'the privilege' to poke fun at eachother on the level of "danskjævel" and "fjeldape" belongs to us
As for the rest of Europe I enjoy reading the lighthearted banter between nationalities
I'd like to parttake, but I don't think I myself know enough about the countries in question to make it accurate enough to both 'sting' and be funny at the same time
When it's americans bashing europeans based on outdated stereotypes, it gets really predictable and bland, and most retaliation, if you want to call it that, is almost always met with low-brow ad hominem responses
Then again, seeing them get so upset is fun on its own
Any nordic country
They are *our* insult-targets, not yours
Whenever someone makes jokes about or insults sweden for being a warzone or the new middle east I get so triggered
(Norway here) I’m getting bored of the jokes about Estonia wanting to join the Nordics
It’s just gotten repetitive
Oh, and whenever I hear jokes about Iceland being
weird, I just think about all the weird stuff that Norway has, even if there isn’t as much superstition
Norway and Sweden have a love hate relationship
Constant jokes on the others behalf
Amusing to say the least
They are, but to be honest it's not because France is the butt of the joke
It's because it's historically ignorant drivel that usually goes hand-in-hand with 'Murican, vaguely messianic circle-jerking and because it's an *enormous* cliché that by now is roughly as funny as Amy Schumer and would be no matter whom it's directed at
Please share with your Germanic cousin, I beg of you
Why is the Champs Élysées lined with trees
So the Germans can march in the shade
My dad used to call me pære (pear), Snapp (as in Chip and Dale) and other typical "twin" nicknames since I'm s twin

"The giggling one". I did giggle a lot as a child
I have no idea where it came from or why my mom called me this but "berta knallfis attom nova". Berte/berta is another word for girl
Knallfis directly translates to a really loud fart, and 'attom nova' is around the corner
So it didn’t happen much but it happened a lot
Not confusing at all
Ah ok, that makes sense lol
I tried the danish intro questions or whatever it was at max level
There were sentences like "The dog is getting drunk". I got everything correct but a lot of the sentences were weird and one about whatching television was worded in a very old way accoring to a dane I know
I have never used it for Norwegian, but according to [this] post, it’s not very good
The Dutch one: "Ik houw fan banaaneuh en eet se ggggrrrgrgrgaaoggg in de ochgggchggtend"
You'd expect a "ja toch" or an "Euh euh Den Haag, mooie stad achtuh de duhnuh" after every Dutch Duolingo sentence, considering how The Hague/Rotterdam-esque each sentence is
Cigarettes
In this day and age there is no reason why something that dangerous is still available in every store
It's illegal here and still it's all we see
Several TV channels technically broadcast from the UK
And while we technically have a gambling monopoly, there are dozens of gambling companies operating from other countries, but advertise against Norwegians with Norwegian celebrities and often have Norwegian names
The result of all this is a giant loophole that makes gambling commercials very common even though they're illegal
A Norwegian comedy show in the 1990's tried a new version of this, ringing a doorbell and just stay there
The "victims" of this prank said it was super frightening
The guy just stood there motionless
The comedian admittes that it was the worst prank he ever did
I was circumcised as well, i've never had any problems because of it
Most pornstars are circumcised, so it's not really a shock to people or anything
And we’re set for the 20s again
> The whole world is slowly going towards legalizing weed but you guys want to go in the opposite direction and ban everything that's bad for you
What the fuck
If grown ass people wanna smoke let them fucking smoke, who are you to tell them if they can or can't do it
So you think meth and heroin should be sold in every grocery store
Well, hard liquor is only sold in special shops, and never in grocery stores
Cigarettes however is sold everywhere
We shouldn't allow the religious amputation of all toes just because we've banned culture-related amptutation of the leg above the knee, which is worse
Going to try out some unstable government of coalitions or minority in cabinet again any time soon
Can’t speak of other countries, but Norway had prohibition of booze from 1916 till 1927
In which countries do grocery stores sell meth and heroin
Sure
That would definitely help
Would take the temptation out of the shops people have to visit very week
> Yes it does, the penis is less sensitive and sex doesn't feel as intense
There's a higher risk for inability to orgasm

I've been to the outskirts of Milan, and I've never seen so much dog shit on the sidewalks as there
Granted, around Napoli there's so much garbage, but the dog shit situation in Milan was a shock to me
Yeah, but it should've been common courtesy to pick it up since Ceasar wore diapers, right
It's polite to pick up your dog's shit even if it isn't against the law to leave it for others to step in
Good point
We have many trolls, nøkken (lives in bodies of water and lures you in), Huldra (sort of witch/troll) and some orc/gnome variant called tusser
But to go truly local: from my old bedroom window I can see an island that used to be where some of the old Viking kings had their seat
Since it is an island, it has many islets and reefs around it
There is a story of some seidmenn (evil sorcerers) coming to the Viking King in the Easter of 998
They wanted to punish him for brining Christianity to Norway
The legend goes that they summoned a black fog, but they couldn't control it at it turned against them
The King had them all bound up and put them on a small islet where they stayed until the tide came in and drowned them
It is said you can still hear their screams when there is particularly heavy fog
I see a lot of comments that think local means "in your country", but I'm gonna tell you something just outside my town

In dunderland
Some of you may know dunderland as the worst horror movie of all time, but it's a place that's actually called gullbekkheia
> "Näcken"- Quite litteraly "The nude one"
According to wikipedia the name comes from a old Germanic root meaning "to wash
>The names are held to derive from Common Germanic *nikwus or *nikwis(i), derived from PIE *neigw ("to wash")
[3] They are related to Sanskrit nḗnēkti, Greek νίζω nízō and νίπτω níptō, and Irish nigh (all meaning to wash or be washed)
We have him in Norway to, he's called "Nøkken" here
In the north of Norway, Draugen is an important figure, - often thought to be a drowned fisherman not buried in christian soil
He could drag boats and fishermen down in the sea, and he could also warn fishermen of death
We also have Fossegrimen, who lives in waterfalls, and is a magnificent fiddleplayer
If you came to the waterfall 4 thursdays in a row, and brought him «fenalår» (kind of a dried and sometimes smoked leg of a sheep), he would teach you his fiddle skills
We have Nisser, who are small beings who take care of the animals and helps out in the farm during the night IF YOU ARE NICE TO THEM, and bring them food
If you don’t feed them, they will do a lot of harm
They will hide your tools, destroy your crops etc
They kind of looks like a small version of Santa Claus, but with old, traditional Norwegian farmers clothing
Then we have oskoreia, which is a bunch of dead people who comes riding through the skies at night, especially during christmas
If you see them, your soul can be dragged from your body and you will join their gang
If you don’t brew beer for christmas, you are in danger of their revenge
On the night before the 13 of December, - Luciadagen -, the evil and feared which/vette Lussi could come flying with her band of dead souls
This was regarded as the longest and most dangerous night
Skratteskjær. Frå Avaldsnes
Yeah but i dont recall nølken being a man luring women and children into water
It does lure people into water though
Great contributions
How could I forget draugen and nisser
Oskoreia have I never heard of before
Cool
Yeah, the Draugs were originally a dead person who lived in a hill or set out to haunt people in Norse Mythology
Look up "haugbui" on Google
Definitely where Skyrim got its inspiration from
It later came to be knows as a spirit on the seas though
Its just that the word draugen is derived from the norse draugr
Which means something along the lines of ghost
Draugen in stories is bound to the sea, so i dont think you could call it the inspiration
When a beer costs 40kr (4€) in the supermarket, you pay for what you drink, and not everyone else
I liked the comment about how people who have ceiling fans are uncultured and narrow-minded
I LOVE the Scottish accent
Watching the crime series "Shetland" at the moment, and my favorite part of it is definitely the accent
Scandinavia is Denmark (excluding Greenland and potentially Faroe Islands) + Norway + Sweden
Fennoscandia refers to the peninsula where you find Norway, Sweden, Finland and parts of Russia
The Nordic countries are Sweden, Norway, Denmark (excluding Greenland but not Faroe Islands), Finland and Iceland
You go to a party, bring your own alcohol as any party right
And then someone just goes and takes form your vodka bottle or smt wothout asking
Apperently its normal to just take alcohol from others at parties in the US lol
Somewhat weird from my perspective as well
Up here "Black Pete" is a chimney sweeper (hence his black face)
[Here is a Norwegian card game called Black Pete ("Svarteper")] showing the chimney sweeper in action
Been there, done that
And loved it
Yeah
Never gone to a party without alcohol
At a normal party i bring 10 0
33l beers and some vodka/wine for myself
And everyone brings their own alcohol, maybe share a shot here or there if someone ask
Considering Mary Jane is illegal in our country, I couldn’t tell you
I wonder if it used to be a chimney sweeper in the Netherlands as well (it kind of makes sense that the chimney sweeper and santa claus, who goes through everyone's chimney, are connected
) But this is just me guessing
Must have been a popular card game since it's was spreading across Europe
> Musta Pekka
So Pekka was never a chimney sweeper
But then again I'm not really picky
I can't remember ever watching a  UK crime series I hated
That's why we have the Nordic Countries category
Maybe we are just a cheap people
Oh, i've never been to a family party so
> It actually originally was a reference to slaves,
Source
Your [Musta Pekka's clothes looks Turkish] Which is kind of interesting
Have not watched it yet
But that is the one where the dead police partner follows him around
Not cheap as in not expensive, but cheap as in geizig
Yes
It just comes naturally after a while, and you can tell when something sounds wrong
Like “en hus, husen» sounds completely wrong vs “et hus, huset” (a house, the house)
It also helps that generally most female nouns can be male nouns depending on your dialect etc
But genderless nouns vs female/male nouns sounds very different
Don’t know how else to explain it
> whether Nutella is neutral or female for example
We normally call it "a jar of nutella" which solves the problem since jar is neutral
I know a couple examples where it's not 100% clear
Like, I say "et kompliment" but apparently it's originally "en kompliment" (which explains the plural form "komplimenter" which I do use)
Naob
no says it's both now
And I guess many would say "en meme", but we do have the Norwegian version of that, "et mem", but I only hear people over 50 use that (I use it too actually, but only with said people who use it)
Yeah
I still struggle with it at times though
"Sender du meg nutellaen" sounds more natural than "sender du meg nutellaet", at least
And Nutella is just a poor man's Nugatti, which is also male
Yes, so I guess that means it's male in Norwegian
Chad Nugatti vs
Virgin Nutella
There is usually a parking near walking/hiking routes
And also if you for instance use UT
no to find a route, it will give you a list of public transport options to get there
Hiking is part of the Norwegian culture, and there are parking spaces in remote areas, but it isn't an organized thing
It's more like local government/local population initiatives
And even if there aren't any parking spots around and you want to check out the area, you can always find a flat area next to the road where you can park, even if it isn't a designated parking spot
Some Swedish series, a few Danish and a lot from UK
Not weirder than something like the HBO Chernobyl series, where most of the actors were Brits of some variety
Nobody with a line was of Russian or other post-Soviet nationality as I recall
Nothing I hate that I can come up with now, but I like the one about everybody being rich and hot
Sucks being associated with gypsies
What do you think about the guns & beer stereotype
All the grammar is complicated, but understanding it is pretty easy with a bit of practice
And the only "harsh german" I've ever heard was an angry-looking Berliner
Otherwise it sounds soft, and oftentimes a little silly
*All English are gay* is also my favourite joke to say about Englishmen (and women) so that’s good to hear
You can come to Norway with any nationality or cultural background and raise your child with them, but the moment you use violence against a child or take away the rights and freedoms guaranteed for a child on Norwegian soil you will not be allowed to be the child’s primary caregiver anymore
We can off course discuss that we as a state should help those parents to use legal ways of among other things disciplining their children, but alas I for one would rather live somewhere that is extremely strict on this matter than anywhere else
So the thing you might see as no reason Norwegians in general and our state institutions see as child abuse
Which isn’t helped by the fact that the state will never publicly state the reason for why a child is taken from their children so we only hear the parents side
I use a brno shotgun for hunting and I love me some urquell, I'm good
*italian have the same stereotype, except they fuck sardines

Bad example, the whole reason they went to Vietnam was because the french couldn't handle it either
Point is, you also lost to the rice farmers after 8 years of fighting them
At the end, the french were defeated in a decisive battle and were forced to let Indochina go when the cold war powers met in Geneva
This was all pre-Suez, so a time when France and Britain still thought that they could hold onto their colonial empires
And it's not like the US only fought in Vietnam either, the conflict spread to Laos and Cambodia as time went on
If there's one war that the french can counter the americans with it's Iraq
If I'm just walking or doing nothing around 15 C seems to be the sweet spot for short sleeved
If I'm doing labour or exercising then lower, say between 5 to 10 degrees
This is also granted there's not a ton of wind
If there is I will usually throw on a jacket
If I’m moving around and it isn’t windy, 15°C is when I start taking my jacket off
I do carry it around though, for when wind happens or I stop moving
If I’m doing hard work, I might do T-shirt in 5-10°C too
If it’s windy, obviously, wind chill is a thing
That being said, I’ll get a heat stroke in 25°C and have to show extreme caution so I don’t get properly ill lol
Haha, I live north of the arctic circle, and people will wear shorts and a t-shirt if it is sunny and above 15
Tourists are so easy to spot, wearing winter jackets and stuff, even if it is above 20
Crazy
In spring, if it's no wind and sunny about 5c. In general in summer about 10c.
It depends on if it's windy or not
No wind: above 15°C. If it's windy then I'll probably wait till it's 25°C (which is very rare here)
If there’s sun but no wind, I’d say around 5-25
If there is sun but with wind I’d say 10-25
If there’s clouds and wind it’s probably around 12-25
We usually don’t get higher than 25 degrees C, but if its over that (i might just walk around in bathing shorts if the water is ok) i will probably go bare top and short shorts or bathing shorts
If we rule out wind: About 10c for short sleeves, and about 15c for shorts
This is my answer too
Wind has A LOT to say about t-shirt weather or not
The reason for that is the Scottish locals has had a colder winter and their bodies have naturally isolated itself against the cold
In the autumn/early winter, the cold weather feels cold
But it starts a process in a body sometimes referred to as "brown fat".
In a couple of weeks, the body adjusts to the colder weather by isolating with a layer of fat
(The Indian tourists have not had this process happen to them most likely, so it feels a lot colder)
So in the spring, people with bodies who have acclimatized to the cold weather, will feel   like 10-12C is quite warm and 20C like quite a hot summers day
But the warmer weather is our body's signal to loose the brown fat, so after a few weeks, 10-12C or even 20C feels quite cold, just as the Indians experienced
As a Norwegian this process have allways fascinated me
....h*e writes in 18C weather, sweating like it was 30C.*
Dismantling of the national railway system and selling it off to the highest bidders
Higher inequality and other right wing side effects
Why we allow right wing parties to be in control for this long beats me
They drove the country into a ditch in their first four years, and my dumbass countrymen gave them four more to set it on fire as well
During this period people have started buying more electrical cars than gasoline cars
Not to talk about the dismantling of the police, courts and counties
And all these new proposes to shift tasks and thus power from the courts to the police and government
**Leiv Eiriksson:** discovered America around year 1000
History doesn't tell where he was born, but he was the son of a Norwegian Viking called Eirik Raude
**Roald Amundsen:** first man to reach the South Pole on the 14th of December, 1911
**Thor Heyerdahl:** among many other things he did a expedition in 1947 by raft across the Pacific Ocean from South America to the Polynesian islands
- Our three Kings in modern times
- Harald Hårfagre (the guy who, according to the sagas, unified the country)
- [Colonel Birger Eriksen]
- loads of athletes like Sonja Henie and Petter Northug
- Famous explorers like Roald Amundsen and Fridtjof (Nansen Amundsen beat Scott for the race to the South Pole and Nansen was the first to reach the North Pole AND he won the Nobel Peace Price for his contribution on helping refugees after WW1), but also more recent ones like Erling Kagge
He was the first to reach "all three poles" (North, South and Mt
Everest)
- Many componists and writers like Ibsen, Grieg and Bjørnson
Might add some more if I think of someone else
Fridtjof Nansen should also be included here
Arctic explorer and humanitarian
I would personally add Haakon VII to the list for his refusal to recognise the Quisling government during WW2 and not capitulating to the Germans
I don't think we can take credit for Leiv Eiriksson
Eirik Raude was 10 years or something when his family ran from Norway to Iceland so I think it's fair to say Leiv was Icelandic
>Vlad the Impaler: Defended Wallachia gainst Ottoman attacks and was tough on crime
My guess is that he's famous for a very specific kind of punishment based on his name
I agree
I agree
Good job
My grandfather has lots of stories from WWII, however he did a lot of things he weren't supposed to (against the germans) and has asked me not to tell any of the stories
Someone somewhere in my family tree (I think it was my grandmother's uncle) served as a Spitfire pilot in WW2, but was shot down or crashed in the north sea a few days before the war ended
My grandfather was an engineer and was inspecting a nuclear power plant in Lithuania I think (can't remember the name of the power plant) when he and the other engineers found out that the power plant had the same fault as the one in Chernobyl
This might have prevented another disaster
Edit: [Ignalina] is the name of the power plant
One of my great grandfathers was a norwegian resistance fighter during WWII and the only reason the rest of the family knows this is because one time while he was in the UK he heard two veterans talking about dropping bombs on a factory
My great grandfather then told them that he was on the ground counting all the bombs that hit
He was very quiet afterwards, because he wasn’t supposed to say anything about it and it is more or less the only thing we know
My paternal grandfather was taken as a prisoner of war in 1940, along with all the other Norwegian conscripts, and stayed in a prison camp for the duration of the Nazi occupation of Norway
My maternal grandfather escaped to Britain, trained as a commando, and came back to do behind-the-lines work in cooperation with the Norwegian resistance
He said he was given an assassination mission in Sweden that was called off at the last moment, which I think he was very happy for
3 of my grandmothers brothers were part of the resistance during WW2
When it was discovered they fled to England in their fathers fishing boat (who waited 2 days before reporting the boat "stolen") and they joined the war from there
My grandfather on my dads side had some germans come into his house while he and his brother was hiding a either a shotgun or radio under the sofa pillow
And my grandfather on my mothers side were a OG fisherman in Lofoten, and was threatened with court-martial because he refused fighting because he was too busy fishing cod
(He was the type of man who litteraly went fishing in a hurricane)
My grand uncle on my mothers side fought against the germans in Narvik
I haven't talked with him but i've heard that he doesn't like talking about it
And when he once were asked about how many germans he killed he answered something along the lines of "I killed enough".
Jeg antar da at han har drept noen
My grandfather also felt bad for some of the things he did (also *against* the Germans)
It seems like such a strange attitude to be ashamed of acts of war against an invader
Our generation would have bragged about it on the internet
Were they the first English settlers in the US
Oh, he doesn’t feel bad about it at all, he just doesn’t want the, recognition I guess

No it isn't. He is (or was) very popular in Norway as well
And in Australia
"Was"  is probably right

The character is supposedly popular in India as well
Would "life coach" fit what "coach" is used for in Poland
"Mobbing" here too
That is true for Danish and Norwegian too
In terms of traditional street scams we don't really have them
Never seen or heard of it myself
The biggest rip off is probably "Flytoget/Airport express train" from Gardermoen airport to Oslo city centre
The express train costs €20 and takes 22-23 min
Whilst you can take the local train which is €10 and just a minute or two slower
The only time Flytoget isn't a rip off is if you're eligble for discounts, they give 50% off for students and if you're below 20 or above 67
But even then it will be about the same as the local train
Only bonus with Flytoget is that they have departures every 10 min, whilst the local is every 20 min
Unless you're in a big rush to get to the airport I would highly suggest to go with the local train
What would happen if you report a taxi drive like that to the police
You made me smile
Thanks
Really
Both sad and interesting that is is common
The advantage with it is that it's more comfortable, runs way more often and has a "if you miss your flight because of us, we'll pay you back"-policy
Which is nice
Agreed
Just be careful during rush hour as the trains get really crowded
Flytoget is still often more convenient since they go more often
Always used them when the company I worked for paid the ticket
but price wise the local train is obviously a better choice
What’s a great replacement
Haha, thought the same thing when I read this
What did you like about Oslo
Compared to most cities in Italy its rather boring
(in my opinion)
>  "if you miss your flight because of us, we'll pay you back"-policy
Yeah, that's definitely an advantage
> the nature just outside the city
True, that is nice
Nature is easy accessible wherever you live in Oslo
That students have to learn both forms of written Norwegian that we have
It's an abseloute joke this still exists and I'm suprised it hasn't been abolished
85% of people use Bokmål and 15% Nynorsk, vocabulary wise they're pretty much the same with some exceptions, grammar wise however they differ quite significantly
It's pretty much a massive waste of time, everybody is able to fully understand the other form without studying it and basically no one uses or remembers how to write in the other form once they're out of High School anyway
All of this makes up a substantial amout of the Norwegian subject in Middle and High School, the time could be put into better use
All of this will probably be abolished within 10-15 years but as is stands it's still something students have to learn in school
Lack of support for gifted kids
I don’t like that we have to take exphil (examen philosophicum) to study at a university
I think it’s outdated
I mean, we got it from Denmark and even there it isn’t obligatory anymore(to my knowledge)
Why
The thing is that there is no one spoken language
Norwegian has countless spoken dialects
The differences can be pretty extreme and affect the syntax, number of noun genders, the presence of the dative case and other things
To create a written language for all Norwegian dialects is no easy task
It's also important to remember that Bokmål (one of the written languages) literally originated from Danish and was later changed to look more like Norwegian after Norway gained its independence from Denmark
So in other words, Bokmål was Danish until about the year 1900, which is when extensive spelling reforms were implemented to bring it closer to spoken Norwegian
Bokmål still has plenty of grammatical features inherited from Danish, such as two noun genders (even though the three gender system is optional in Bokmål)
Nynorsk was based on the various Norwegian dialects and is made to be a written compromise between how people talk across the country
In Nynorsk, the three gender system is obligatory
Verbs are conjugated differently from Bokmål. Nouns are pluralized differently and many other things
Jackson Crawford explains it pretty well in [this video] I highly recommend you watch it if you want to understand the Norwegian language situation better
Well, at least you guys have a school specifically for gifted kids (Atheneskolen)
I wish we had something like that here, preferably close to where I actually live
EDIT: Private schools otherwise are not necessarily the answer, though
I'm not sure how it works nowadays but when I went to the later years of Elementary School(Year 4-7) we had 3 seperate math classes which ranked you on your level
This was only 9-10 years ago and can be seen as discriminatory in a way I guess
Personally I liked it since the classes were more suited to the pupils levels
The smarter kids didn't have to bore themselves to death and the worst performing ones got easier tasks
Short answer: it’s a philosophy class
Yep
That annoys a lot of people I know, because we would’ve never had it if not for the union
And our government can’t even see that it’s outdated, they’re just saying stuff like “well it’s always worked”, “we’ve had it for a long time”
Being married to an Afrikaaner
I find Afrikaaners to be very conservative, but I find Dutch people to be much more liberal
My husband actually feels more at home culture wise in countries like England or Germany, compared to The Netherlands
So I guess lots have changed since the 1600-something when the Dutch started moving to South Africa
One thing I can say though is that Afrikaaners are extremely hospitable
If they say "you can come and stay at my house" they actually mean it
And they throw the best barbecue parties (braai)
> Afrikaners are generally more conservative and religious
True
> a bit apprehensive at first but are welcoming if you get to know us
I actually find Afrikaaners to be extremely hospitable
And when they say "come and stay at my house" they actually mean it
I have no idea how Dutch people are in this regard though since I never stayed at someones house there
I had the shock of my life the first time in South Africa (15 years ago) when i realised that even walking outside could be dangerous (especially after dark)
And I know things have changed a lot since then
I friend just shared a story about a close call in broad daylight at a road crossing
A couple of people pretending to beg, and then trying to hijack the car
(The person was able to drive away)
When you live in a country where there is little difference between wealthy and poor, and crime rate is low these things are extremely shocking
I hope things will change for the better
> So egoistical evangelicals with a lack of empathy and an emphasis on "me first" isn't exclusive to the US
Neat
Could it be that this is more common in countries where the difference between the rich and the poor are large
Just a thought that hit me now
"Too many poor people to pay for so I don't want to help pay for them
My husband doesn't want to take myself and the children to South Africa at the moment
He goes there alone to visit family and do business, but the rest of us stays at home
Kind of sad, but we hope to visit Australia soon instead (his brother emigrated there with his family)
My husband said the other day that he has lost hos alertness that he had while living in South Africa
Like always locking the car doors when having to stop at a street light, and always paying attention to your surrounding to detect danger
And then I told him he is wrong
When we visit a shop, he will always know how many people are in there, and where they are located
Always
(I on the other hand can be completely oblivious to my surroundings when out and about
> I would go back but I would probably stick to the more affluent areas which is a real shame
I know
My husband have talked about that if we do all go down there sometime in the future we can stay at a friend's house which is located in a gated community, which is heavily guarded by safety guards carrying a gun
How on earth can you experience a country from inside a type of "prison"? But at least inside the gate you can safely go for walks
But still
My uncle told me last week about some people he knows that went on holiday to South Africa last year
They drove from city to city, and loved it
Obviously they never checked the safety advice given to tourists going to ZA
They could have gotten themselves killed
Around the same time a Norwegian tourist disappeared on the beach in Cape Town
Probably robbed and killed, but unfortunately they never found her body
Sadly she thought that going to the beach alone was a great idea
>Cape Town is OK but even so, you still have to be on alert
A Norwegian student disappeared from a beach in Cape Town last year
She was there with a group of students, but decided to stay a bit longer to take some photos when the rest went back to the hotel
She was never seen again
I am shocked that no one has told her that being on the beach alone is a really bad idea
I assume she was robed and killed, but her body was sadly never found
> That last one took me months to not freak out about
I had anxiety attacks quite often when we first moved here and I tried to walk alone
That is rather sad
But happy it got better
I would say Finland is even safer than Norway
That being said every city I have visited in Europe I have walked around safely, even after dark
(I have avoided walking around after midnight on weekends though, as drunk people can be a bit unpredictable, no matter where you are)
> Yea I saw that
Unfortunately people go missing so often in South Africa
She was either robbed and killed or trafficked
Or killed, chopped up, dried, and sold as muti
(I hope not)
More uncommon yes
But came to think of it as I'm watching [this documentary] at the moment
Well Norway kinda took Tacos from Mexico and its basically a national dish here at this point
Well, during part of the period that Norway and Sweden were in a union, the flags were supposed to carry [the Union Mark] popularly known as "herring salad". Nobody misses those flags
Not because of anything evil about them, mind you
They were just really, really ugly
Well, Norway did do a dick move back at you in 1905
Entire Norwegian cabinet: "If we can't have our own consular service, then we resign
All of us
At the same time
King: "Okay, I'll have to make a new cabinet then
Who's up next
Norwegian politicians:
King: "Seriously, this is one of the duties I'm required to do, is make sure Norway has a cabinet
Who wants to be next
Norwegian politicians:
Norwegian politicians: "Also, since you failed to do one of the basic jobs of the king, we've decided you're not our king any more and we're independent
King: "Now wait just a minute
Swedish government: "Right
It's war then
Important European Powers: "No
We're here to make sure there is never a war in Europe again
Because we're quite sure we can do that
Now you two shake hands and be nice to each other
If we all do that, there will surely never ever be a war in Europe again
The twentieth century is going to be so awesome
Call it even
If there was a yellow car passing by, the first one to yell "YELLOW CAR
" get a freepass to punch the other kid
Edit: turns out this game is played by kids in many countries
And it makes me think how weird it is that a game like this is globalized, before the internet
It's basically been passed from kid to kid across borders
We also did the first one
A friend of mine had an eisenhower dollar and they are huge
Same over here but with a bottle cap
We called this "blodfemmer", using a five coin (femmer) so both the name and the game is basically the same
Kongen på haugen is what we called your first game
Really fun, especially if there's ice on the slope
Same thing with snowball fights
We did snøbasing instead of your number two
Snøbasing is where you pull an unsuspecting victim down and shove snow into their coats and face
You had to be on guard all winter
During the warmer season, we instead put ivy or itchy berries down the back of your sweater
Same here, but I assume that it changed to yellow car as beetles became more rare
Nothing like an arbitrary reason to punch a good friend
I'll probably say something random, or litteraly just respond py saying: Oh, so you want me to talk norwegian
in norwegian
Not really, as the question only came up to me once
Me and a mate started doing a sentence in different dialects to demonstrate how different they are
But there is a tongue-twister that goes "Ibsens ripsbusker og andre buskevekster"
"Ibsens currant-bushes and other bush-growths/shrubberies"
I know how to pronounce the non-welsh pronunciation
you know, the easier version
still impresses people
Yeah, I get awkward and mumble something like  "weeell, yes, no, what do you want me to say, I don't know
" and then throw in an inhale "ja" since thats's supposedly unique to the Nordic languages
I believe I read somewhere that the name (or part of the name) stems from a train station, and was an attempt to drive more tourism there
Do you know of that's true
i think the llantysiliogogogoch part was added to the 'old' one
not sure though
Don’t mind me, I am just here to say I really really like your flag
I love the unique colors and it looks really good
Have a nice day:)
Side-note: I recently learned that for period of time some Europeans were not considered white in the US
Spanish and Italians for instance
And Irish people
Which was a surprise since some Irish people have a paler skin-tone than me
And I am Scandinavian
So I plan to look more into why Irish people were considered non-white
Probably something about the culture
Or being Catholic
Or maybe something else
> that Irish people were basically black but with pale skin
It's hard to grasp what reasoning they used to come to that conclution
> an article on it called "how the Irish became white
Will check it out
Thanks
> My grandma
That is surprisingly recent
> how pubs would have ‘No blacks, no dogs, no Irish’
In the UK
> Because the Irish were considered to be a lower 'race'
Which makes you wonder how they came to that conclution
> Because they were Catholics basically
So is most of the rest of [Europe] But maybe most of the immigrants until then came from England and Germany
ludo, star of africa, cards, ropes and ladders
Probably the 3rd biggest city Trondheim will be unknown to most foreigners(I hope most Swedes and Danes would get it)
Trondheim does have a fairly succesful football team that played many years in Europe vs big teams in the 90's and 2000's but as it's not named after the city it doesn't make the city that recognizable
Oslo I hope most people would get
Bergen is probably split, should be more known than Trondheim but far from everyone will know it
I don't buy it, Essen is on both ticket to ride and pandemic
In Norway we don't really have any big cities except for Oslo
If we talk big in norwegian terms, perhaps Bodø, it's in the north, but probably overshadowed in fame by Tromsø for it's size and turism, and Narvik fpr the historic significance during WW2
Maybe the northerners will disagree
Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim
The big cities that aren't Oslo
I remember it because it means little in my language
I think some foreigners will know Tromsø, but only because of the northern lights
Almost like they forget people live there, too
Norway doesn't really have "big" cities - even Oslo's population is less than 700,000 - but you could come away with the impression that the country is Oslo, Bergen, and a lot of empty space, which is not accurate
I mean, there *is* a lot of empty space, but with lots of towns and small-to-mid-sized cities dotted throughout
>It’s impossible to forget the name Mo I Rana once you’ve heard it
Yep
It's named that to distinguish it from other cities named Mo throughout the country
The word "mo" means flat grass/sand plain
Austria-Hungary
Edit: I.e., Østerrike-Ungarn in Norwegian
Østerrike-Ungarn witch mean Austria Hungary
Same in Norwegian: Østerrike-Ungarn
Though Wikipedia uses the full title: Det østerriksk-ungarske monarki
Is it true that alfresco fridge burning is a scottish custom
I heard My Summer Car was a documentary
It has changed once, and then went through several edits and addendums
The first constitution was adopted on 17th May 1814, but that was changed after a brief war with Sweden the summer of 1814 which resulted in Norway entering a personal union with Sweden
This is referred to as the November Constitution
Most of the provisions was kept, but the first paragraph about the sovereignity of the country was edited to reflect this
Since the procedures for editing the constitution wasn't followed this was in fact a new Constitution and not an edit
When Norway left the personal union in 1905 protocol was followed and ther was no break of continutity at that time
After that there's been several edits on issues such as voting rights, state religion, parliamentarism among other things, but in essense the document from November 1814 is still in effect
Among the most famous of edits is the removal of  the so-called "Jew paragrah" which was the final sentence in §2 guaranteeing religious freedom:
*" Jesuiter og Munkeordener maae ikke taales
Jøder ere fremdeles udelukkede fra Adgang til Riget
This limits religious freedom for Jesuits and catholic munks as well as barring entrance for jews
The sentence was removed in 1851
As a side note, the November constitution is little known among Norwegians
It was seen as an embarrassment
Most people only know about the May Constitution
In fact, in 2014 the Constitution's 200 year celebration focused mostly on the latter
The process for edits is a bit cumbersome by the way
Edits can only be made if two thirds of the members of parliament in session approves
An edit must be affirmed by a second vote the first,second or third time the parliament convenes after a new election
That means that an edit may take anything from 15 months to 4 years to approve
EDIT: clarifications on the use of word edit and change
How do you define “change” and “edit”? Because according to [lovdata ] there has been a total of 315 changes(endringer) from 1814 to 2014
I always thought of edits as “redigeringer” but what are you referring to here as you seem to mix them up a bit
Edit: and a number of paragraphs have been repealed so I would at least count those as changes, so where did you get that “1 change” from
No, there has been 315 changes made to the constitution
It is actually a fairly simple process that requires 2/3 of Stortinget (parliament) to be present and a 2/3 majority
Have clarified a bit
I use Change as in "Have been replaced by a new constitution"
Edit as in "text have been added, omitted or replaced in the current document"
Norwegian Bokmål: Ekorn
New Norwegian: Ikorn
Dialect where I grew up: Ikødn (I have no idea how you write it as it is just a spoken language, but it's funny cause the literal translation would be "in the dick", as "kødd" is a slang term for dick)
Ekorn
Not too hard i think
Looks like the same word as in Norwegian, though looks way more complicated than our "ekorn".
Eikoᶇᶇ [ɛikɔɲː] in my area
Lots
I don't think we should export weapons to Saudi-Arabia, for instance
And we should reimpose sanctions on Iran
Both are issues where my government disagrees with me
wether or not we want to join the eu
Norway likes to pretend to be a peace loving country, but sells weapons to dodgy countries
We also hand out the peace price, but are to scared of other countries reactions to nominate controversial people
We recognise Israel, but not Palestine
It should be both or neither
Also, Norwegian government are too scared of Russia
We are neighbours, and should cooperate more closely (while still keeping our military guard up)
We cooperate nicely in the northern parts, but that has been better
There isn't a single country that actively works to destabilize the situation in the middle east more than Iran (at least when only considering the middle eastern countries)
They have the largest network of terrorist proxies of any nation there and they have carried out attacks in Saudi-Arabia (as seen on the news), Syria, Israel and now they are blowing up some random western oil tankers just to drive up the price of oil
Their foreign policy is being the douchebag of the middle east, basically
And that's just their foreign policy
The domestic policies against their own citizens is, as we know, terrible too
All in all a terrible regime, that I think we should stay far away from and not do any business with
>We also hand out the peace price
"We" as in Norway and the Norwegian government have nothing to do with the peace prize
It's the Nobel institute that awards it and they are a private organization that choose to deliver it *from* Norway
This is a problem for the government, yes, but they can't do anything with it other than "recommending" not to do it
>Norwegian government are too scared of Russia
We are neighbours, and should cooperate more closely
Then you can say goodbye to help and support from USA
Love them or hate them, but their influence is so big that it is something we simply cannot loose
Choosing a totalitarian and not-very-democratic government instead goes against all our values
I know the Nobel Institute is independent, but when Nobel prize winners have to enter the venue for the ceremony through the back door, then it is safe to say we are hypocrites
I am simply saying that Norway should be on board with their decision
I am also not saying we should kiss Russias ass instead of USA, but to elaborate and continue developing projects like the «grenseboerbevis».
>continue developing projects like the «grenseboerbevis».
That I can agree with :)
Actually I have never heard of anyone doing this
The equivalent here is improving your grades after you're finished with school the first time
You can do this by taking an exam (privatisteksamen), and you can pay for private schools which help you prepare
In the stores they're sold in fridges, and I keep them in my fridge at home
That's the way it's always been, and I'm actually surprised to hear otherwise
I store them in the fridge
It’s what my parents always did, and that’s really the only place I have the room for them
Absolutely
My eggs
Or chicken's eggs
lol
But seriously, we put ours in the fridge
For those who don't, what is wrong with you
I put eggs in the fridge
I've never seen anyone do that
Are you from a rural area
I saw a video explaining about the different methods a couple of weeks ago
But it really just made me wonder more, since we've always stored them in the fridge here in Norway
Video:
I have this weird feeling he might be from Fyllingen
Edit: Or Fyllingsdalen, as I guess the place is called
Whether you should stack the firewood with the bark up, or down, like an idiot
I mean, literary everything
It almost became a constitutional disaster some years ago when they discussed wheter to have friday—closed kebabstores in Lillestrøm (because myslim's sacred day is friday), a small town near Oslo
Norway is already pretty divided over wheter we should keep stores closed on sundays or not
So yeah .... It ended with the them deciding to have muslim stores/kebab—stores closed, but only in Lillestrøm I believe, so I don't know how good they can enforce it
Linguistically it is a mess to say the least, with Bokmål, Nynorsk, Rigsmål, Høgnorsk, Samnorsk and literary a tousand other varieties with only minor differences from the main ones
And if you are in a bokmål—dominated area and say like «mjølka» which is in dialects, samnorsk and nynorsk they will point it out
Same goes the other way around, «melken». And many nouns fet 3 genders this way, some even kind of five (since Nynorsk can conjugate nouns in 2 regular ways, like elv**e**r and elv**a**r), so yeah, it's that
German may have Der/Die/Das Nutella, but we have «Søppel» with 6 different declinsions in Bokmål. Høgnorsk had 8 in one noun, but I can't sadly remember it rn
click on a blue letter
F, we norwegians really have little to do ...
Whether it is correct to eat fish or porc on christmas eve
Soft, you stinky heathens
le nutella
Der Nutella
ye, in norway it’s tsjekkia
It was actually meant to be had by mid day, middag, Mittag, but development happened
Back in the days when people where farmers or worked on farms they had the meal about noon, some almost still have, at least eats dinner (middag) early (before 16, maybe 15 ish)
The farmers were up early, had some food then, some snack and break maybe before 12, then the big meal around 12, some food again later in the afternoon and the evening perhaps
You get the point
With the industrialisation, later more service oriented economy, office jobs and fixed work hours from 8-16, this got out of fashion
Including maybe more continental influences
We also have a saying “fine folks dine late”, I don’t know quite where that leads really
At ours dinner (middag) is normally 18-ish, often not before 19
I can’t help but think about the bigger, longer lunches that are normal in some countries in Europe and beyond and the lighter dinner/supper/evening meal later in the evening
Might be a parallel
The expression middag has only stood by and survived the development
This is a debate that has been going on for at least 20 years now
There are books on the subject like: [Norwegian Wood by Lars Mytting] which is a very good read, at least in Norwegian
Bark-side up makes the firewood stack in a more stable way and also the bark will shield the wood from moisture that usually comes downwards
Bark-side down makes the moisture escape faster because moisture escapes easier upwards
If you are stacking firewood outside you want the bark-side up to prevent more moisture
But if you are stacking indoors it doesn't really matter as long as you keep the stack off the floor and in a well ventilated place to prevent rot
We call apples for sweet apple
Potatoes have the name of apple
Fries we call pomfri or chips
Then snack potato chips is potetgull (potato gold) or chips
Then the mixups continue lol
Mohahaha
Íslens*K*a
Yes, I know, my comment ended up longer than I first thought
as usual
It was a curiosity worth mentioning
This race to eat early drives me mad as well, I just don’t understand it
I guess some up here adjusts when they eat after the time of the year and daylight, longer days, later meals
I don’t know how it is up north, where the light or lack of it is really noticeable
I guess some just are traditionalists
Turning the upper layers upside down is a popular way of solving the problem in a lot of places
ahh ok
My lingustics studies commence in a month, will be more informed then xd
Swedish speakers have a hard time distinguising ch- and sh-, so you often hear them pronounce "chair" as "share"
Take on me is a classic
It isn't easy, but there's always someone who thinks they can do it
Two songs that are quite specific to my corner of the country would be
Tore Tang (Mods)
Hjerteknuser (Kaizers Orchestra)
Both are to be sung very loudly, very badly, in chorus, with a sort of wistful twinkle in the eye (twinkle may be due to alcohol as much as sentimentality)
also, Barbie Girl by Aqua (although they are Danish-Norwegian, so only half-counts i guess)
Especially during sommer I would say Idyll and En Solskinnsdag are songs everyone sings along to
Tore tang for lyfe
The popularity of Mr Brightside in the UK is insane
It's a song from 2004 by a band from *Las Vegas,* while everyone seems to think they're British for some reason
It has a record of being in the top 100 Singles Chart for a whooping 240 weeks, and as of 2017, it had charted on the UK Singles Chart in 11 of the last 13 years
I live in Norway - Am i going to Oslo, or further on to Sweden
Train
Anywhere else
Plane or Car/Bus depending on if there is seawater between me and the destination as the crow flies
North of Ålesund: Plane
Sweden: Car and Train
Rest of Europe: plane
EXCEPTION
Denmark: Boat and or Car depending on what I feel like
Trains out of Norway isn’t much viable
You have to go through Sweden, change a few times, get to Copenhagen and then get on to your destination from there
If there was viable solutions that would take me down the continent over the night directly
Sure, yeah, but until then it has to be plane
I'd say when flying takes longer, including getting to and from airports, security and all that
Price is also an element though
Trains go 80 km/h, planes go 800 km/h. Factor in that we live quite a way of travel avay from the continent by train, and it's a no-brainer
I’m Norwegian having been living in UK, and If it was affordable I would take the train back and forth and everywhere else
But the airplane is so much cheaper that I can’t justify taking the train on my budget
I have paid more taking the train to the airport than I paid for the flight
so stupid and so bad for the environment
For some of us it is much easier to drive to Sweden
Oh yeah true
I’ll change it
I was just thinking of Stockholm for some reason, but I have driven to Sweden a lot of times when I think about it
Don’t know what I was thinking
The only socialist country I know of is North Korea
Sweden is a Social Democracy
That is (very) different than Democratic Socialist
Just for interest, how would you describe USA's economic model
> Would you say the high levels of Union membership is the reason why the working classes enjoy such high wages / living standards in your country
And if not what is the reason why
Yes
Plus government policies strengthening worker's rights
The government gave every worker 5 weeks paid holiday for instance
Then there is laws about paid sick leave, how much overtime an employer can demand from workers etc
Unions make sure everyone is paid a fair salary
The leftist in the US also drives me crazy, because they paint a picture of the "socialist" Nordic countries that is not correct
We are not fucking socalist
> North Korea isn’t really socialist though
True
It's communist
> North Korea has even attempted to distance itself from communism as they removed all mentions of the word in their constitution in 2009
I would probably label them more as a communistic cult
I would say its a mix of unions and government policies and laws
> It's not, and it doesn't even claim to be that
They claim to be a democratic people's republic, so what they claim to be or not has little value
Communism = *"a system of social organization in which all economic and social activity is controlled by a totalitarian state dominated by a single and self-perpetuating political party
"* [source]
So I would say they are pretty close
They have added a cult aspect to it though, where everyone is to worship and bow down to the "eternal" leaders
They call themselves The **Democratic** republic of North Korea
Which is both sad and funny at the same time
It probably helps that half of it was English:)
From dictionary
com:
I would say the first definition is how its supposed to work (but never did)
The second definition is how it always ended up working in every communist country in history
> The “communists in recent history” you’re referring to always claimed to have created socialist countries
So you have the Communist Party of the Soviet Union but the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
The countries were never described as communist, not even by their supporters
True
And that is where some of the confusion comes in I think
All the communist countries basically failed at socialism
As it was never so that the means of production, distribution, and exchange was owned or regulated by the community as a whole - as socialism is supposed to be
Ever
It always ended up as something that was forced on people by the help of the army, police and the secret police
And everyone never became equals where there were no classes in society, since the elite was always present, and always the ones ruling over the rest
North Korea
No country ever achieved to become 100% socialistic
But I would say North Korea is the closest you get at this point in time
In spite of them calling themselves the Democratic People's Republic
> All communists are socialists
What do you mean
Yet no country ever achieved that, neither through socialism, nor communism
So I see it as a dream that will not come true, anywhere in the world, ever
Nobel thought, but un-achievable
And very naïve
Only if greedy and power hungry people disappear from the earth that could happen
Until then we need to stick to other economical models
So what is this mystical middle ground like
Discount France
Some are blue, right
Same dude same
I saw the original Thing not to long ago
The only words I understand from the Norwegian guy was: dog not real
Same here
Yes, but the question was what do the movies get wrong
hahaha i love watching that scene
I’m Norwegian and don’t like fish
There are tons of bad English, but none of that weird skyrim-accent people seem to think is Norwegian
Yes, I've never met someone who doesn't. Learnt when I was around 6, I think
Not only can i ride a bike, I am a cycling enthusiast on club level
I ride, breathe, think and dream bike
I love the freedom of riding which road I like, or exploring paths in the woods
I like to watch and smell the nature
I like to feel the wind and sweat in my face, and the suffering of going all out uphill
I think I learned it around 5-6 years
I might've been a bit late, as I were a quite cautious kid
I know that I could ride my bike when I started school at 7, at least
i learnt it when was 4 or 5
I was around 5 when i started to practice with my parents
Every time i fell i would get angry and tell my parents i would never ride a bicycle ever again
Eventually i became good at it
Yep, I learned to when I was like 4 or 5
Now that I think about it, I don't know anyone who can't ride a bike
Yes, I used to bike competitively
I can’t really remember not being able to ride a bike
Same in Norway
The extra wheels goes off when we're about 6
I would die to see a horror RPG game based on the Norwegian butter crisis of 2011
It would be really cool with a game similar to Kingdom Come: Deliverance set during the Norwegian civil war era, I think
We sometimes call Sweden "søta bror" meaning "sweet brother"
I know the Danes sometimes call us mountain monkeys, "fjeldaber"
What about svenskefaen and danskjævel
Don't forget partysvensker
At first I thought it was meant as a joke on how bad the stereotypical brit tanned, then I saw it came from the irish
Sorry if offending
Mountains are to us what fields are to you
That's 100% correct
They are cute/sweet (both words are interchangeable for "søt"), and they are indeed our brothers/sisters
IKEA-bøger
It means haggling in Norwegian
Stein is also rock, and probably related to stone
That germony just came and we surrendered but mostly about the recistance in norway arter the occupation
How is that possible
How is the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact covered
OK, I understand
Maybe my perspective is flawed, but I've always thought of it as the most important and impactful event in history
The viking age ofc, and the period of "*Norgesveldet*" in the middle ages when the kingdom was at its largest after the civil wars (mostly 13th c.)
I would say the period after 1945 and before the 1970 when the country was more homogeneous and things like economic liberalisation had yet to be discovered here
But generally my impression is that most believe that we are currently living in our golden age and what differs is rather the views on how to best preserve the status quo
Einar Gerhadasens 17 years
Probably the same as yours, OP
Some romanticized idea of the sagas or some shit
Yes, for some reason we are weirdly proud of our plundering, murdering, kidnapping rapist viking ancestors
While conveniently neglecting or refusing to learn about English losses like the [battle of Patay] And as already mentioned, which side in the Hundred Years' War achieved their goals
Crispy duck is one of my favorite foods
Duck and turkey is also more common around Christmas
But eating hen is not very common
Chicken has taken over, and though I have eaten hen, that was at a restaurant and I haven’t seen it in any stores in ages
Chickens are the most popular
Turkey and duck seem to be getting more popular; fresh duck is easily available where I live but I don't see fresh turkey so often (unless you call lunchmeats fresh turkey)
There are people who hunt grouse or similar game birds and eat that, but that is not common
Except for chicken, we eat a whole turkey every new years eve
Kind of like american thanksgiving
Ducks are also eaten, but not very often
Ive only eaten it in chinese restaurants
Some poeople hunt and eat grouse or geese
I think that sums it up
Bird that isn’t chicken is usually a meal for a more fancy situation
In my family we do it a lot of goose, as we hunt and our neighbour has a goose infestation on his crops and we help him thin out some of it
We eat duck maybe two/three times a year, and about the same frequency with hens (we use them to make Coq au Vin or however you spell it)
> Chicken has taken over, and though I have eaten hen, that was at a restaurant and I haven’t seen it in any stores in ages
They'll have hens in the frozen meat sections of the shops
I use it maybe two or three times a year
I’ll take a look next time
Same here, I buy a hen maybe 3-4 times a year and make broth and hønsefrikasse
Duck has become our new years eve dinner
I’d say most cities in Finnmark
Finnmark was bombed and burned to the ground in WW2
There was nothing left, so the cities have been rebuilt quickly, cheaply and without proper planning
Alta, Finnmark has many times been voted Norway’s ugliest city
In Norway, northern Cities like Kirkenes are pretty easy picks
Had to be rebuilt mostly from scratch after ww2, quick and cheap
I say mostly, since some of the foundations were still useable in the new constructions
I retract my statement
Kirkenes still has a lot of the rectangular blocks, but has made efforts to be more presentable
Alta, (another Finnmark city) is pretty ugly
(And was also burnt to the ground, but not bombed as much)
I would like to add Førde
There was a book a couple of years ago that wrote about the ugliest towns in Norway
I don't remember the books name, but it listed Sandvika and Gran atleast
You can not have been there then
LU isn’t bad
Living in Frankenthal made it easy to avoid LU and go to Mannheim
I've lived in two vastly different parts of the country - the north and the west
I mainly speak in a northern dialect, but I work with children so I speak in a broken accent most of the time to them
If I were to get mocked in any way, it's because my accent is so fucked up, lol
In general only my grandparents complain that I changed my dialect from western to northern
Yes
Everywhere I go
Definitely
Yep
And yes, I'm from Bergen
I feel ya
I haven't lived in Bergen for almost ten years and have a pretty toned down accent, but I still get mocked from time to time
At least I'm not trøndersk
«Du e østlænning, du
Hadæ!». Had that a couple of times when I called people from Bergen when I worked at a telemarketing place during high school
I get it a lot as well when I’m not at home
Especially in Western and Northern Norway
Sørlendinger don’t seem to care
I’m from Oslo
There are so many dialects, probably hundreds or maybe even thousands
You can speak sort of "bokmål" (main written language) and it will sound kind of like eastern dialects
You can’t speak bokmål and the Eastern dialekts are incredibly diverse
There’s a huge difference between me from Oslo, someone from Ål or someone from Fredrikstad
I’d argue that the Oslo dialect is way closer to some dialects from Finnmark than it is to dialects from Telemark, Buskerud, Hedmark and Oppland
The dialects along the Eastern coast are pretty similar, but Østlandet is way more than the coast
Please read what I wrote again
You can speak "sort of" Bokmål and it will sound "kind of" like eastern dialects
I know there are differences between eastern dialects, but please don't pretend that some people in the east will say that they wish they had a dialect
Bokmål and Nynorsk are both written languages, but a foreigner learning Norwegian can't really obtain a dialect without living in and speaking Norwegian on a daily basis
Innlandsdialekt
It would be a rural version of what we speak in Oslo
They’re more likely to stress the first syllable rather than the last and would usually use some dialectal words that aren’t common elsewhere
Personal pronounce will also often differ
People from the East saying that they wish they had a dialect are just ignorant of linguistics
Well yes, obviously
I don't think anyone other than those people claim that they speak "Bokmål" because if you know the first thing about Norwegian it is that we have two written languages and a million dialects
Yep
Some would even argue that the dialects of Western Oslo as well as finbergensk and fintrønder are Danish dialects rather than Norwegian
I don’t really dissgree
My dialect is far closer to Danish than it is to the dialects of for instance Trysil or Bodø.
-Messing up compound words (for example writing "kaffe bønne" instead of "kaffebønne" (coffee bean)
Many people tend to mix up og and å.
Og = and
Å = to (do something)
They mean completely different things but are pronounced the same way
Hvem and Hvilken
Hvem means Who
Hvilken means Which one
South in Norway they use "Hvem" on objects, like asking for a buss route: "Hvem buss skal du ta
Direct translation would be "Who bus are you going to take
But, also annoying I would guess, that in Midt-Norge (Trondheim area) we say "Hvordan buss skal du ta
Direct translation: "How bus are you going to take
Pronunciation of words that start with skj sk and kj
It seems to be a dying part of the language, but especially old people are a bit picky, as well as some younger people
Writing it is mostly fine, people don’t fuck that up too much
"Og" (and) and "å" (to) (in Norwegian)
Jeg var alltid klar over at tunfisk biter, men hvem er det ananas ringer til
Also messing up og and å.
Og means and, å means to (as in to do something), but they’re pronounced the same
For some reason, people from Bergen mix up these all the time
In the rest of the country it's not so common
Korsen buss skal du ta :D North chiming in for fun
I’m pretty sure that’s a dialect thing
I fuck up this to this day
Depends on the kind of internship
If you're doing it for job experience as part of your classes, No
but they usually only last a week
If its the two-year internship you need to get your trade diploma, then yes, they must be paid
I love the architecture of NYC
It is so grand, modern and vibrant
Totally different from what we are used to in Europe
I loved how big everything was,  it was really shocking to see irl just how tall shit actually is, my fav city ive ever been to even with all the flaws
Haven't been there yet
:( But I hope to visit one day
I'm fascinated by central park being surrounded by a wall of buildings
Yeah the subway is NYC is by far the worst system I’ve been on
Not sure if it counts since it's originally a book, but The Fault In Our Stars is called "Faen ta skjebnen" which translates to "Fuck fate".
Die Hard in Norwegian is “Aksjon skyskraper” meaning *Mission Skyscraper* . I guess it’s not really wrong about the title
13 Reasons Why - The controversial netflix series about suicide was translated to "13 Gode Grunner" in Norwegian which means "13 Good Reasons". Which is VERY misleading
English to English "translation": "Gleaming the Cube" became "Skate or Die
"Spinal Tap" -> "Hjelp, vi er i popbransjen" (Help, we're in the pop business)
"Saturday Night Fever" -> "Lørdagskjøret" (The Saturday Rush)
Not from english, but german:
"Christiane F. - Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo" became "Christiane F. - Å være ung er for jævlig" (...to be young is too devilish \[hard to translate exactly, here it means something like bad or messed up\])
You Only Live Twice is called James Bond i Japan (James Bond in Japan)
Same Tintin energy
Oh my gosh that's hilarious
13 Gode Grunner in Norwegian, which means 13 Good Reasons
I think that's very misleading
Someone in my building stole a pair of my jeans off of the drying rack in the laundry room
I also had a couple of doctoral students and a professor rip off a paper I wrote during my Master’s degree and publish it in a journal without crediting me or asking me to collaborate with them
Someone stole my phone once
Another time someone snatched my friends purse when we were walking back to our hotel in spain
Nothing serious
My apartment has been broken into
I've been pick pocketed
Threatened with a shotgun
Threatened with a knife
Beat up
I think that's the worst of it
Edit: Oh, and years of sexual abuse as a kid
Almost forgot about that lol
My bike was stolen and thrown in the river
Actually no
But I did walk passed a blown up post box right after it happened (it was next to my post box)
It turned out to be kids blowing up their teachers post box
(I guess they didn't like her very much
My snow racer was stolen from my home
Found it later at the bottom of the hill close to school
My backpack was stolen from work
My neighbour went apeshit paranoid on drugs and tried to break in and beat me up
Someone broke into our house when i was a little girl
They stole my piggybank and a bottle of homemade wine
Pickpocketed 4(!) times in my town Oslo
I have a tendency to end up at the wrong place at the wrong time
Oh and some punks stole my training bag with my used clothes and underwear
Monsters
Yeah, an attempt at debit card fraud
My bank was quick to pick up on it and everything went OK for me
Worldwide
You OK man
I didn't, I should have, but I didn't and I doubt it would have made a difference
I was one student, there were three of them (two doctoral students, one professor)
I was also on very thin ice in my program, and not very well-liked by my peers
I could have taken it to an ethics committee, but there's no question that they'd have defended "their own" at my cost
Unfortunately it's extremely common, and while there may be formal provisions for recourse, they aren't always feasible in the practical sense
I've learned this the hard way, and know plenty of people in academia who've been victim to the same thing
It always comes down to the professor's/administrator's word against the student's. Administration does all it can to look after their own, often to the extent that students effectively have no recourse at all
Actually not doing too bad considering
Can't complain
Life could be much worse
Splendid
God jul :)
The duo "Trøste og Bære" did some vulgar but amusing songs:
[Drita full før Drøbaksundet] about a drunken trip on the ferry to Denmark
[Villto Sääppää Kyllää Mi] in their own words, "a quasi-Finnish celebration of Arja Saijonmaa and Leningrad Cowboys".
[Jag är inte sjuk] parody of Swedish "dansband" music
Apparently popular with fans of the genre as well as those who hate it
Is Topgunn considered a guilty pleasure aswell
Fun fact: In Germany and Russia, Poland is referred to as the "kid land", and ww2 is called the "custody battle".
Scandinavnian too
Presumably most Germanic languages
English has mother tongue, at least
I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm not seeing the similarities at all lol
That's normal
Anything built after mid 90s-2000 would have these
I do see some student homes/old apartments that still have old windows
My apartment building has similar ones
I think it's more common in apartments than in houses
But I don't think the American style ones where you push it up and down exist anywhere here
How interesting
I live in a 10 year old house, and every window does this
And the house is not high end in any way, shape or form
so this is just the type of windows which are popular now I guess
How do US windows open
Here I've seen them in pretty much all apartment buildings, but rarely in private houses
I have never seen them here
Edit: I take it back, I have seen them, but they're not normal where I live (rural Oslo)
Can't remember ever seeing one up north
What
Oh well you live in Bergen again don't you
You guys are freaks
Oh ok
Never seen one of those here
Norway can be both windy and rainy so I guess we prefer windows where it doesn't rain in through the window when it's open
Apetor is the only one I can think of
no sadly
StreetmanTV, EMH (God's Trash on YouTube) and i used to watch Karlinorge alot when i was younger
Addexio from Norway
no sadly
Apetor
Jameskii
It's not old-fashioned, just formal
We mostly use it for introductions, congratulations, condolences, that kind of thing
In formal settings it's still common, and when greeting a person you have never met before
We have had a couple of big media cases about muslim men who wouldn't shake hands with female coworkers
One got fired from a teaching position, one didn't get a job he was interviewed for
Both claimed it was racism, I think the teacher sued and lost
There was also a muslim woman who wouldn't shake hands with the crown prince
I'm a dog person
Which you could probably guess from my username
I think I saw a map on r/Europe not long ago where it shows that cats are more common to have as pets in Norway than dogs
Edit:  [here's] the post
I think the cats are more common in Europe
I’m fan of both, but I’m more siding with dogs in general, especially bigger ones
If I would own one it would be something like a golden retriever or Labrador because of maximum cuteness factor
Cats are cool to pet when they show up, but having to rely on one would be absolute nightmare to me
In general I feel like Norway is about 50/50, but different neighbourhoods, regions and people can be more in favour of the one or the other
A woman in my building also does that
Languages in Norway by speakers:
* Norwegian: 4 320 000+
* North Sami: 7000~17000
* Kven: 2000~8000
* Norwegian sign language: ~4000
* Scandoromani: 100~1000
* Lule Sami: ~500
* Southern Sami: 340+
* Skolt Sami: Extinct in Norway
* Ume Sami: Extinct in Norway
* Pite Sami: Extinct in Norway
* Russenorsk pidgin: Extinct
* Rodi: Extinct
The smaller ones might be very unknown
Especially those who aren't one of the sami ones
Sami language
[Lulesamisk]  - a sub group language of the scandi indigenous people spoken by about 650 people
Sami, and Kven, however, the Kven language is dying out
All the dialects in the region really
At least Elfdalian is famous among language enthusiasts, the others aren't.
And we have two National written languages
I am an Uppersilesian, I am speaking both Silesian and Polish and I think that what the government is doing is a version of postcolonialism
They have refused to recognize the minority for 7 times over last 5 years, despite the fact that 150 k. people signed up a bill proposal to recognize the language and protect it
Kaszubski is getting 80M PLN a year to protect and care, but Silesia is getting none
Moreover, the Government (=Kaczyński, ruling party leader) is calling us "camouflaged German option". Recently they are even changing the names of the Institutes in Southern Poland to vipe Silesian language and Silesian people out
Institute of Regional Culture (Instytut Kultury Regionalnej) is now called Institute of Polish Thought (Instytut Myśli Polskiej)
I hate that and, sorry to say, Poland is going to be the reason we have less variety in our society because the language and the culture will not survive
As for now I am supporting Silesians from abroad as I refuse to live in this irrational and crazy country where everything what is considered normal is to be Polish Catholics with no minorities, other religions, no Germans and no Jews, but to mention LGBT people and movements
Poland is taking a huge step backwards and I hope people who do that will drown in their own gravy
Do they have 3 in Finmark though I wonder
HeidelbergCement is huge it seems
Only learnt of them when my engineering professor told me they had aquired Norway’s biggest cement manufacturer NorCem
Are you reliant of a car where you live
I’m 27 and I don’t hold a driver license, even I could’ve had one for close to 10 years now I’ve had no real use of it
Living 30 minutes outside of Oslo I can manage getting around by train, trams, metro, buses and electric scooters
And it’s faster than going by car
I see having a car in the city as more of a plague than benefit
I’m free to go where I want, when I want, without thinking about parking and where to drive
In the surrounding countryside and the suburbs there’s unfortunately very much planned for car ownership and not driving is looked a bit weird upon
What’s your view
*add: This made pretty good response, I would like to be active in the discussions myself, but I haven’t had time unfortunately
Yes, there’re times when I could use a car as well, most places in Norway are relying on cars and if I would go somewhere outside of where I lived I would have to have one
If I just lived some kilometres away from where I do now I could need one badly
I see that for most people, especially around here, you need a car to get around
It’s also interesting that many use more time with public transport than car, for my daily schedule using a car would take the double of the time, I would get stuck in traffic and I would have to find parking and still walk or take tram or something to where I’m intended to go
no, i live pretty much in the center of Bergen, and so everything i need is within walking distance, and if not the train station or buss stops are
In theory: No
My grandparents biked 70 km to Sweden to buy sugar back in the day, so I have no excuses except time
In practice: Yes
I'd have to walk/bike almost 10 km to the store or train station to reach anything
9 km to school
Or 20 kilometres up the valley to visit friends
I can not be bothered, especially in winter
Right now life would be easier if I had a car, as I would get 7 hours at home between shifts over the 6 hours by using public transport
But on the other hand, I would not be safe to drive after a 12 hour night shift so maybe not
I would move to the other side of the city if my job wasn’t project based and eliminate the issue entirely
But nah I’ve been living 10 years on my own without a drivers licence in various places and it’s never been a huge issue
I don't need one but I'm glad I have one, especially when dealing with my kids' activities
How do you pick up a new sofa
Or transport a broken fridge to the garbage place
Now I do live quite rural, public transport here just isn't practical
I'm still at a loss for how I would be able to live without one if I didn't live rurally
Cause, I'd still have to go places that are rural
Whenever a big holiday comes up, I go back home and my car is filled to the brim
Snowboard, skis, clothes for 2 weeks, christmas presents, my PC (desktop with all that brings, yes I still do LANs), board games
I just don't see how I'd being that on the bus
I'd also be stuck in my parents house for the 2 weeks without one
Luckily those are not frequent activities, but I wonder myself how we solve these things in a pretty car based country in the future
I think we will move towards more electrical cars, not necessarily a more car free society
If you live on the countryside with children it is simply not possible to live without a car
And in the city there is already lots of people living without a car
(But I still wonder how people then get rid of their broken fridge
Taxi
Have some service to pick it up perhaps
Home delivery and such are services that I guess will explode in Norway in the coming years, if just the prices are fair, since people don’t want to go to places like malls anymore, they’ll spend their time more wiser and fewer got cars as well (at least in more central places
We’re generally a very easy target for internet shopping as well since many places are rural and variation is scarce
Norway is unfortunately very similar to USA in many ways
It's the same in Norway
Altough it's more about the noise
On sundays and other holydays you can't make  unreasonable loud noise
So mowing your lawn is too loud
This is to reduce noise pollution which is bad for your health and can cause heart attacks
Somehow I managed to read *the Baltics,* and the answers were so confusing
I think I need more coffee
There is a german fort from WW2 a few kilometers from my house
Also its not uncommon to stumble upon remnants from the medieval and viking ages, it often happens to farmers who find cool stuff while working their fields, i have also heard several stories of children playing outside and finding viking swords and other artifacts
I dont live in a city, but the one closest to me (Trondheim) was founded by the viking king Olav Tryggvasson in 997
There is a huge statue of him in the city square
I live in Oslo, pretty close to the ruins of a church from the 1100s. There's another actual church from the 1100s still standing in the city though, Oslo's oldest building that's still standing
for anyone interested in reading more about it
Interesting stuff
I am a teacher of social studies in Norway
In the national curriculum it says that students in VG1 (1st year of high school, 16 year old) must be able to explain the goals and structure of the EU and discuss Norway’s relationship with the EU
I know for a fact that we spend quite som time doing this, but it is all very theoretical and difficult to be able to explain in great detail years after learning about it
Norway’s relationship with the EU is what takes the most time and is debated the most
And as always, most Norwegians are anti-EU
As far as I know it isn’t really teached here, just mentioned sometimes
Best way is to not pay on the bus, because then it’s more expensive
Either pay using the app, or online
App or a travel card
Cash might be accepted some places, but that's far between nowadays
A card with RFID chip
I top it up two times a year
Its weird now, beeping my card in has become muscle memory
We are now going over to a new system where there are card readers on the bus stops instead of inside the buses, but the readers are still there
I've been told several times bu drivers that my second beep of the card is unnecessary,  but I can't stop
At least in my city, there are different ways, you can get a card and scan it, but i use an app that has a periodic ticket digitally
I buy a ticket that lasts for 6 months and then i dont have to think about it or show it unless the bus gets a check on, in which everyone has to show their tickets or get a fine
However since the checks happen so rarily and you dont have to scan anything or show your ticket to the bus driver, a lot of people just get on the bus without a ticket and hope they dont get caught
Mobile app is my preferred method
But you can also use a travel card (same size as a bank card containing a chip) or bank card
Cash is no longer used on most public transport
we have reisekort "travel cards" or we just use an app
where i live we have the app Fram which is for all the transport in our region except for taxi
in oslo they have a ticket app that goes for everything
so i usally use the app
An app for bus travels is pretty handy over here
You’ll get half the price using it, but I believe it’s different in the urban areas
Travel card, app and cash, from least expensive to most expensive
I never pay in cash, and when I used to take the bus to work, I used travel card
Now when I only occasionally take the bus, I use the app
Cash, visa card, card issued by the bus company, various apps
It think it's most common to just say "Smile
" which is "Smil" in Norwegian, and pronounced with a similar sound as the "ee" in "cheese"
Norway: Smil (smile) or appelsin (orange(fruit)) are common
Cheese here too but we can also say «appelsin» which means orange
We say «Appelsin» with a long i, which means orange (the fruit)
Don't forget _appelsiiiiiin_
For everyone else, that means Orange
(the fruit)
Norway, that's in Sweden, right
(I think/hope they meant to say Scandinavia)
I’ve only ever had the follow up question of “how is it like living there
Idk I just live here
Haven’t lived anywhere else
Sometimes during summer it gets really warm, and sometimes we have snow
What sort of answer are people expecting
Because they ask wanting to know the answer, not as a polite “how are you” greeting
Do they want a full breakdown of life from newborn to death
Do they want to know something very specific
I DONT KNOW
This made me lol
Do you also get the "what do you feel about frozen pizza"(grandiosa)
I have a Italian mate and I cringe every time he gets asked about this
I also hate it when Norwegians try to be special, "oh, we here in Norway all speak funny English and are really special"
Yeah, seeing these comments here, I can't really think of anything cliche or stereotyped about Norway that people could/would ask
The worst I've gotten was 'Wow, you actually exist
I thought Norwegians were like trolls and fairies'.
This is something I do not understand
I have several colleagues from Poland, and it is not cool to talk about abortions or corrupt judges
These topics is just a no go, and I dont get it
If they say Denmark, that is not so bad
Just not Sweden, our arch enemy :)
Yes, just like the UK used to be an influential European country :)
(We were a part of Denmark and Sweden and Denmark again etc for hundreds of years
So when we got our independence, we needed a King for our new country and
\*looking over to the Swedes in the east \*  ...we asked a prince from Denmark if he would be our King
I mean 30 is probably the highest we really go
I haven't checked the stats, but I would guess 25 is a good day
It can get around the same, but not very dry
A lot of coastline to go to on those hot days
That's great - the Minnesotan and the Norwegian agree that meaningless smalltalk is confounding
Classic Scandinavian memetic trait
Why would anyone confuse Denmark with Holland
Yes, definitely
When I lived in England I was asked how we deal with polar bears roaming our streets on a regular basis
But to be fair, Norway is one of the few countries where polar bears do roam in the streets
(It is on Svalbard though) :)
I think Sweden gets stereotypes for like hot girls and being dumb/having weird accents because of American movies
I guess you are right there, maybe some old testament fans are opposing abortion here in Norway but most people see it as a natural possibility to have
It is that blend between new and old way of thinking that fascinates me about Poland
Thankfully reddit exists, so I can hear it from you guys
I know, that really stings
We hate Sweden, Sweden and Denmark hate each other
Really makes the little brother syndrome flair up
We would trade all the Norway hype for you guys hating us like we love to hate you :)
>it's just love
It is
We hate you in the most loving way possible
And Norwegians don't want to say this loud, but we think Swedish is the cutest and downright most sexy language in the Nordics when spoken by the opposite sex
That said, you don't really have much competition (trying not to look at Finland, that would be awkward)
You surely meant to say you should not throw potatos in glass houses
And to Danish people, that means ...shhhhsss :) When you chough up that potato, don't throw it
People can now cross the border to Russia and buy dirt cheap gas (1/4 of norwegian prices)

Norway has 368 medals in the winter olympics, which beats USA in 2nd place with their 305
Around 98% of our domestic electricity is run by hydroelectric power
Norway supplies London with the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree every year as a way of thanking the UK for sheltering our royal family during WW2
The first people to reach the south pole (Roald Amundsen), to cross Greenland (Fridtjof Nansen) and to reach "all three poles" (North, south and Mt
Everest, Erling Kagge) were all Norwegian
There's also been many other explorers before and after them
Ok it's not very "wow" but we have the world's largest kicksled
And the next to largest one
I wouldn't be surprised if we have the third largest too
>We introduced the Japanese to the salmon
What did the salmon think of the Japanese, after you introduced them
I think our super-long coastline and the insane number of islands of islands (both in the top three in the world) deserves a mention too
It's a thing that I don't think many foreigners are aware of
>Largest producer of high quality boar semen
>Largest producer of insulin (pretty good quality, too)

Here's some other fun facts about british laws:
- It is illegal to carry a plank along a pavement
- It is illegal to fire a cannon within 300 yards of a dwelling house
- It is illegal to beat or shake any carpet or rug in any street, however beating or shaking a doormat is allowed before 8 am
Some other things covered by this law also includes erecting a washing line across the street, slaughtering cattle in the streets, singing profane or obscene songs or ballads in the street and wilfully and wantonly disturbing people by ringing their doorbells or knocking at their doors
- It is illegal to handle salmon in suspicious circumstances

The peace prize has it's own committee made up of Norwegian people, it's decided in Norway and given to the winner in Norway, but yes, it has the name of a swede on it
There is a regulation saying that being buried in a coffin is illegal, and therefore Svalbard has a policy that everyone who are dying has to be sent to mainland Norway beforehand (probably because it would be insanely expensive to send them there while they're dead)
It is only permitted to be buried there after being cremated

It might be funny, it's also the way you should argue with people

That Breivik (far-right terrorist) will only spend 21 years in prison because we have a prison system that treat prisoners as princesses

Apparently we've committed genocide against the Sami minority
You often see these comments on youtube videos and stuff too
You can blame foreign sensationalist media for this
They decided to run this dishonest narrative from day one because they knew it would generate clicks
"MASS MURDERER ONLY GETS 21 YEARS IN JAIL
&#x200B;
And people obviously took the bait because they don't care enough to do two minutes of googling
The thing is
as a pure matter of fact, criminals *are* treated better here than a lot of other places
That's because a lot of other places think you can improve people by treating them like shit or murdering them - the former is obviously wrong to anyone with half a brain stem, the latter is only true to a disappearingly small proportion of **human beings** no matter what they've done
Norwegian approach to prisoners is rehabilitation, not medieval-ass retribution

There are probably some bigger ones, although the first one that came to mind was Therese Johaug's doping case
One of the top 2 female cross country ski athletes testing positive for doping, she won the world cup as the best athlete the season before
It was a pretty big case, although a little toned down because of disagreement of whether she actually did it on purpose or not
Wasnt that the woman who made that saxobeat song
Good times
As far as I remember very few people actually thought she did it on purpose
Wasn’t the banned substance just an ingredient in a face lotion she was using or something
And I’d say the Giske thing was our biggest recent celebrity scandal
Or perhaps the various escapades of Petter Northug
The recent Bertheussen-scandal is quite special
In november 2018 a theater called Blackbox had a play where they where “exploring the lifes of people on the far right”. In the background they had some videos of some houses, and the actors where pretending like they were laying in the bushes of the garden and observing the lives of the house owners
It wasn’t mentioned in the play, but the houses actually belonged to the minister of justice(Mikkel Wara) and some other prominent figures in the far right party (which are quite moderate compared to european far right parites)
The wife of the minister of justice is called Laila Bertheussen
She was completely unknown before the following incidents
She went to the theater and was angry with them
She was kicked out of the theater for recording the play with her phone
Several on the right was angry with the theater and claimed their play created a dangerous atmosphere for politicians
December: Someone tried set  Wara’s car on fire
A swastika was tagget on it
And “racist” was tagget on the house
January: Two politicians (far  right party) received threatening letters which called them racists
At some point the police started to have 24-hour protection of the house
March: The police’s bomb squad investigated some suspicious letter delivered to Wara
March: Wara’s car was burning at night
March The police indicts Bertheussen for doing all of the things herself
The whole time she claimed that the theater had motivated some radical lefty to attack her and other people on the right
She was sentenced to 1 year and 8 months and was found guilty at disturbing the government institutions with threatening letters and fake attacks
Had to Google a bit
Is it like "funny wanker", half compliment, half insult
Northug's cases is also a good shout, I considered saying that
Although I feel Johaug and to a degree Sundby's doping cases has had somewhat large consequences on how foreign people and media sees our skiers
I also doubt Johaug actually doped deliberately to cheat but that scandal has heavily tarnished the reputation of Norwegian skiers
The view I feel like has shifted from them being considered clean and pro fair play to now every other succesful Norwegian skier being accused for doping or asthma, without any proof or backing really but based on those two cases
Not in Norway that is but by foreigners, especially Swedes and Finns seem to bring it up every time I've noticed
Bohemian Rhapsody
When I was a kid I didn't understand a single thing
Never really liked music, lol
I find it catchy thoe
Same goes for german songs, I find some of them catchy, but when I learnt what they mean I didn't really bother
You know there are many rap and hip hop artists with non disgusting lyrics right
No, but I did go to something we called summer camp or whatever which lasted for a week and we played volleyball, handball, that kinda thing
But only for 6-7 hours a day, 5 days
We dont go in the summer, we go in winter
If they want
I know of a few camps which are overnight, but yes, it’s like you said, going to camp and doing outdoor activities
just admit it mate you did nazi that one coming HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I feel you, though :/
Dentist are the expensive ones in Norway, compared to anything else
That said i probably should go to them
I have not been to a dentist since i was 19, thats 11 years ago
I got a checkup and drilled 2 itsy bitsy tiny holes when i was in the army, that was when i was 22, so 8 years ago
&#x200B;
Anyway, i dont know but i have had no issues with my teeth apart from those two tiny holes, i have no problems either, can't feel any discomfort or such
However, i do have some dental tartar so while my teeth might be fine and dandy, my gums could probably do with some caring
Once a year, not sure what's the average
I always go during July, except last year
It was pushed back because of Corona so I didn't get to go before September
Yearly is the standard, though some people don't go every year, or at all
1 or 2 times pr year depending on if I have any problems or not
Once a year
I go to the best dentist, and he says it's enough
I don't know if there are dental hygienists in Norway, I've never heard of them
Same
Haven’t seen one in
five years
And before that it was seven years between visits I think
My dentist is old-school cool and extremely relaxed lol
He told me to come back when I felt like I needed it
My teeth feel good, no pain anywhere, they work perfectly and as they’re supposed to
I went more frequently when I had my braces, of course, but I’ve never had any cavities or things that needed fixing, except for the extreme tooth/jaw misalignment
Because they can’t afford, that’s the reality in “the world’s richest and best country”.
Never heard of this dental hygienist
We have dentist, and "kjeveortoped". One does rutine checkups and minor things, the other is responsible for braces and more advanced stuff
Tannpleier is the Norwegian equivalent, and for more serious check-ups the tannlege does the work
You can also be sent to an oralkirurg for serious stuff
People here often check when advised by the dentist
I have been advised to check every 2 years, and I do
Can't remember the last time I had a hole though
The visits usually consist of some cleaning and xrays
I’m aware, I have discussed this with said dentist
I’m sure I will need more frequent visits in the future, as I get older
As of now, as long as no one wants to spend money on my teeth on my behalf, it’s not happening
I can barely put food on the table, so as long as my teeth have no opinions, and teeth aren’t a part of your health (according to our universal healthcare system), they will have to be
Ive never been to a tannpleier, unless they offer this service at the tannlege as well
It's usually a tannpleier that performs the routine check-ups and takes the xray
Might be different where you live
Poverty is a thing in many countries
At the moment, I am studying and my only “income” is the student loan
Due to Covid I am out of work, but since I’m a student I do not receive any additional support from the government - even if I’ve been working and paying taxes for many many years
Yeah, I live in a smaller town
But what I would call tannlege does these things
Nothing at all really
Except for a few years in the Viking era we hardly had much influence on the rest of the world
Hence my lack of expectation that schools in other nations teach about it
That the whole northern part of Norway was completely razed to the ground by the retreating German forces at the end of WW2 and all the civilian population was forcefully evacuated in an effort to halt the liberation of northern Norway by the Soviet Union
The Soviet troops in Norway was voluntarily withdrawn and the last soldiers left Norway on the 25th of September, 1945
Winter War
May only be because we sent you some volunteer troops
Norway: Not openly hostile, but not super friendly either
It's easier if you come from other European countries, USA, Australia and New Zealand
But still not super easy
If you are used to easily make friends you might get a bit of a culture shock coming here
But, it's easier for someone who is lets say 25, rather than 35
The older we get the more set we are in our social circle
It very much depends on several factors, especially where you settle and who you meet
You can be easier welcomed in some places and among some people than others in general
Broadly speaking I feel Norwegians in general are pretty much accepting to everyone, but there’s also still a lot of sentiment around against people from some parts of the world
Whether someone manage to “adapt” to the Norwegian society, fit in and integrate also much depends on where you are, but some nationalities seem to manage it easier than others
Expats don’t try to learn Danish no matter how long they still and expect everyone to speak English for them
Immigrants/Refugees have some issues, but the 2nd generation integrates decently
I don't agree at all
A lot of people are sceptic, but I think at least people in the large cities is pretty open minded
My own experience as an American who has lived in Norway for decades is that Americans moving abroad tend to fall into one of two groups
One group is charmed and excited by everything
It's all new
And exciting
And we should do things like this back home
They will have some bad days, start seeing the problems, get the edges knocked off them, and most of the time will end up with a decently balanced attitude
They appreciate some of the differences, grumble about the others, and mostly end up enjoying their new lives most of the time
The second group arrives expecting everything to be worse, and therefore everything is
They generally end up stuck in that position forever, or until they move back to the States, whichever comes first
I don't know that the distribution is 50/50 or even close to it, but then, I haven't been keeping records or anything
Yeah I think you are right
But even if we are friendly, it's not necessarily easy to befriend us
But, the younger you are the easier it is
Nobody said they couldn't, but it is more likely for some than others
I never bathe, but I shower 3-4 times a week
Daily showers really aren't necessary (or great for your skin) as far north as I am
I don't think I've had a bath in at least 4 years
I've never regularly taken a bath
However I shower, normally, once a day (but only wash my hair every other day at most)
You have a shower in the morning
And if you go to the gym or exercise in the afternoon, you shower afterwards
And if it is a really hot summer's day, you might have a shower just to cool off
Price of electricity or hot water is not a factor since it is cheap
You shower as much as you want
In winter, people probably shower less
Because sub zero temperatures means the air is dry (humidity is frozen)
And air inside a house is dry because of heating
Showering also removes a isolating oily layer on your skin, so going out in really cold weather after showering is cold
Better to shower before going to bed to let your skin develop a bit of oily skin to protect from the cold
If you are on holiday in a cabin in winter and hot water is scarce, you do not shower every day
I remember my first trip to Denmark
I was staying at someone's house, and they asked me if I wanted to take a bath
They meant a shower
Not sure if its only that part of Denmark they say bath for a shower
That being said, most people in Norway take a shower every morning
In my house we also have a bathtub, so I like taking a bath now and again
Up here in the North, once a day is a bit excessive in general
In warmer climates it's necessary
Who wants to go to sleep with wet hair just to wake up with a birdsnest as todays hairstyle
Or you'll have to take time as you wake up to wet your hair, comb it and dry it again, after already having used time the night before to shower
So much easier to just pop in the shower as you wake up in the morning
Haha well I only shower about 3 times a week in the winter, 4 maybe 5 when summer is the hottest
If you get dirty and sweaty after a day, it may be because you shower too much, which is not good for your skin or hair in the long run
No, I just use a knife, same one I'd use for cutting up vegetables
Pizza slicer is definitely the norm, but I have a pizza scissor (as in specifically meant for cutting a pizza) and it is so much better than a slicer
Can confirm
Scissors are way easier when gutting fish, cutting fins, and basically preparing fish
I do use a sharp thin filleting knife if I want to cut the fish from the bone or draw of the skin, but for everything else a scissor is better than a knife
Oslo, everybody loves to hate oslo, they just take everything from all the other citys
Northern and eastern Norway also make fun of eachother, but I feel like it's slightly more okey that northerners make fun of them, since it wasent so far ago that notherners were heavely discriminated and looked down upon
But yeah, people from Oslo get everything there, even with offices being moved thete,  but the worst thing is that they arr to daft to understand all the other people are pissed at them
Northerners
The general joke is that they're all potty-mouthed red neck alcoholics
My part of the country (West) is known for being unintelligible bunch of farmers, juxtapositioned with being home to two of the major oil cities in the country
Oslo has a typical capital city reputation
Edit: I forgot to add, the south being fanatical Christians
Everyone makes jokes about Bergen
They have a funny dialect
Speaking with that dialect is comedy gold when you're 6
The name sounds like it's a slum
That is what I imagine when I hear that name
My teacher(from the north) had a story he told in class
When he was younger he went to university somewhere in the southern parts
Many people asked him stupid questions like "do you have stores up there" and "do you have a pet polar bear".
I thought everyone loved to hate Bergen, but maybe that's just here in the east
From what I know we like to make fun of Oslo and Bergen mostly
I thought we were the most laughed at tbh, for being full of rånere and all the Alabama type jokes
Still get thos questions though, but I think it's more to make fun now
My sister went a year to school down in eastern norway and apparently she fucked reindeer because she was northern norwegian according to her classmates
Just remember that it wasent until like the 90's or something that it got illegal to descriminate people on the rental market, so a common thing that you would see in the ads was no norhern norwegians
In the 70's they actually had to make student apartments for northern norwegian students because they had such a hard time finding a apartment
There is a long history of discrimination, and if you want a summarizing of that history, told in a very comedic way I would recomend you to read "Støttebok for søringer i Nord-Norge". It's a humoristic view on this
Do you mean northern norway, I am really confused now
Yeah I've heard of Slough before
Mainly by watching ISP play Cities Dkylines and name shitty things 'Slough'.
Nah, Oslo people like to make fun of Bergen, Drammen, and Østfold
Bergen for constant rain and for thinking they're more important than they are
Drammen for being a drab industrial/port town
And Østfold for being full of rånere, inbred, and kind of slow
Not saying that any of these are *true*, by the way, except for Bergen being rainy
(Drammen's a rather pleasant little city
) That's just what the jokes are about
Thanks for explaining that way better than I did
Yeah, I have heard some of them, I think drammen is a beutiful town and I enjoy visiting, but I only have bad experience with people from Drammen
Though, this was in my youth, so I am not going to judge in general
I know what Østfold is known for, it reaches up here north to, but I dunno, it seems like a harry place to me, with some neo nazis, that is probobly mostly from sweeden
I don't really like the culture in Bergen, probobly because they act like northern norwegians but more loud and too confident, I'm not sure if they take themself to seriusly, which is probobly a pluss if they don't.
Now I have seen several times people from Oslo getting buthurt over out jokes on them, propobly because they take themselfs to seriusly
But I was talking in a more general term
My fiance is from Larvik, and I have friends all around eastern Norway, so I know everybody who don't live in Oslo makes fun of Oslo
But in general from eastern Norway I have heard to many bad jokes about northern Norway, and alot of them make fun of it
It's not that I can't see the humor in it, but their not even creative, so it just get bothersome some times
It gets really old really fast when the only thing you hear is if you live in caves
Not a movie thing, but there's a town called Hell that has a Hollywood sign
You forget about Hællæwood
No, I just didn't know about it (if this isn't a joke)
It's a real joke name at least
It's the name Fredrikstad takes every time there is a movie premier there
Like the world premier of the new karate kid movie
- Oslo (630 000)
- Bergen (269 000)
- Trondheim (180 000)
Oslo is the closest thing to a proper international city
If you include the areas around it, the total population is closer to 1 million
The other cities just feels like large small cities (if that makes sense
Trondheim has the largest university and Bergen has a lot of mountains and nature around it
There's also a lot of shipping and harbours there
Oslo = more international
considered uppity and posh and big by others
good infrastructure/transport considering it's a big city
they also get to drive faster on roads compared to the rest of us, i guess because they live next to Sweden
huge variety of services, this is one of the cities where new concepts come first
weather is medium, they seem to have all the seasons
shit beer =P all foreigners sound like they are from Oslo since all the learning mediums use that dialect
Bergen = more rough around the edges
surrounded by nature/mountains so lots of hikers
confusing infrastructure and annoyed about increasing toll stations, transport is also very bleh
very small selection of stores and restaurants, we seem to run on monopolies
rains a LOT
we don't get all the seasons, we get seasons combined with monsoon
best beer (edit
because we need it) =D
Stavanger = sunny city, has sand beaches
decent infrastructure and transport system
they have roads in the middle of their roundabouts so that buses don't have to curve
even they hate the toll stations, but actually did more about it compared to bergen
more variety in stores and restaurants than Bergen tbh
people are imo very friendly and more chill, probably due to them having better weather and more D vitamins
Trondheim = never been there
but known to me as a student city
looks pretty too
> Half of this dude's life seems to be lived at 4 am on Sunday mornings
I need to move to Malmö
There are farms in Oslo
In Maridalen, for instance
You're doing nothing to dissuade me
Because almost everyone gets vaccinated as a kid
Edit: [96% 2 year olds were vaccinated in 2018]
Came here to say his
Personally I don't know any parents at all who have not had their kids vaccinated
They are few and far between
Yep
We haven't had the need to make it mandatory
And I hope it doesn't get to that here
It does
Charlemagne is Karl den store, the English kings named Henry are Henrik, and king Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden is Svenskeknugen
Yes and it confused me so much later on
When we had English class and learned about kings, or on the internet looking for information or reading things/comments
Some times I have viewed some as two individuals, when they really were the same with different name in Norwegian
Same thing with countries as well
I thought "Belarus" and "White Russia" was two different countries
And that Wien and Vienna was two different cities
Hehe
knugen
It's pronounced Nikolaj
I suppose, but my money is on Karl
It's a very old Germanic word, and presumably, name
After 10-12 Danish beers, the language seems less incomprehensible
I think both Liverpool and Glasgow are much nicer cities than they are often portrayed as
I also though Brussels and Milan were pretty nice and a lot less gray than their reputation suggest
Internationally I would add Philadelphia in the USA which I thought was pretty nice even if got its far share of social issues
Croatia is pretty great
Beautiful, with good pizza and seafood
You gave us away to sweden, you
sandbank
I agree
Belgium is one of the nicest countries I've visited
And even better food than Italy and France
And then the Dane said to the Belgian "YOU" are breathtaking
Oh I see, so you were not keeping to the subject of the post
These are probably common everywhere
After-work beer with your coworkers on salary day
I work at a fairly large place and we have an e-mail list for planning each monthly get-together
If you go out of the country, especially on a conference or something else work-related (but usually just vacation too), you have to bring back some candy for the office
Usually bought at the airport tax free store
You usually don't get anything nice when you start working somewhere, but when you quit there's cake and a gift and a small party
My manager has started getting flowers for his employees' first day because he thinks it's dumb that we only celebrate when people leave
Breakfast at work is not common
And reading through the comments it makes me realise just how boring we are
When its my birthday I hope no one remembers, and I will definitely not bring a cake
[Når sjelen hentes til helvete] by Dimmu Borgir
Black metal which Norway of course is famous for
Kvelertak is probably the best band with Norwegian lyrics
If you wanna include national elements, their major hit Mjød is about vikings and their golden drink mead
Then there's Rogaland, about their love/hate relationship with their home county
Their 80's inspired 1985 is about an Orwellian future, and Bråtebrann is about when the singer and a friend played with matches
Oh, and the epic Fanden ta dette hull about a murderer whose skeleton ended up in a museum for a hundred years before being laid to rest
Ingenting is a great band too
for Norway it would probably be
Eric Bloodaxe (885-954) literally cut his brothers heads of
Vidkun Quisling (1887-1945) was leader of Norway after the German invasion of Norway and was in 1945 convicted for treason and was the last to get a death penalty in Norway
vidkun quisling
when the germans invaded he took a cab up to a radio station and preformed a coup over the radio, listing his new ministers he had never even asked to be ministers off of a napkin he had hastily scrabbled them down on
also, he actually thought the nazis would let him rule, pretty quickly thry installed a kommisarat
We also had Frederick V. Alcoholic (to the point of injuring himself numerous times), one primary lover (5 children with her) and numerous prostitutes, it's said his sex life took some wild turns and in the end he whipped them until they started to bleed
He was well liked though by the general population afaik
You don't get a name like Bloodaxe for nothing
Same
Castles are dope, would be crazy not to like them
In times of war (and the subsequent aftermath) it was legal to execute treasonous convicts until arount 1970
Huh, we have almost the opposite situation here in Norway
Gendered words are viewed by many feminists as excluding
Even so much that the Norwegian word for Norwegians (Nordmann, or "Northman") are being considered replaced by these groups
There has been talks about giving a more neutral sounding alternative, but no-one has really talked about retiring nordmann
Yes
Things have a tendency to creep over the border
Sweden is horrible when it comes to drugs though and I'm sure it's kept Norway from legalising it earlier
Nope, just different variations of "takk". Tusen takk, mange takk, takk skal du ha
Takk = Thanks
Tusen takk = A thousand thanks
Takk skal du faen meg ha
You can say "takker", as in "takker og bukker".
Hahaha, saw this one in the inbox and didn't understand what the context was
Yes, that's the present tense of the verb "to thank".
I'm pretty sure it applies for all Nordic languages
No, but I am aware of them having a secret atomic bomb-programme
Okay, when did Sweden have such a large air force
Late 80s? So, USSR, USA and UK had larger then
But yeah, we all had large armies
Finland and Sweden weren't in NATO and thus had to defend against USSR on their own in case of an invasion, Gotland had like 8 military bases
Norway also had to hold a large army, because we were only in NATO to get a shield against nukes tbh
We wanted to stay neutral, but after Stalin promised Gerhardsen to not invade any other countries he literary invaded Czechoslovakia a few months later, lol (more a coup thoe)
So, then the red scare exploded in all of Europe
Gerhardsen, the PM and leader of the communists, snitched on many hundreds if not tousands for being pro soviets
And we became one of the founding nstions of NATO
Anyways, so we wanted US protection, not US help
We refused their tbh demand to have military bases on Svalbard, or having long time foreign forces on norwegian soil
Thus we had to hold a large army, 400 000 at the most I believe, excluding reserves, military service was mandatory and many were imprissoned for refusing
Nowadays we have no army to speak off and have given US a military long term base in Norway, to frighten the russians
There are around 300 american troops there ....
So all nordic nations have heavily neglected defenses nowadays tbh
Sweden really want an EU army to not have to spend much money on military
Btw, don't forget my questions at the beginning
My cat
Coffee
Weed
A good book
Laptop
I think this is really just about it, I am a simple creature
Apart from my cat, none of these things are unique to my country/culture
I guess I'm just a child of globalization
I dont own a lot of items that are really essential to me
I'd say the few items that are would be
* Phone (Obvious one)
* Card holder
* Sony noice cancelling headset (Amazing for commuting and flights, had them for a few years now and love them)
* AirPods pro (Bit of a luxury item that I didnt really need but I wanted a pair of wireless airbuds for running and they are very nice and useful, I love everything that doesnt involve a cable)
* Laptop (Need for uni work and just easy to carry around)
* Desktop (I still very much prefer desktops over laptops so this is what I'll use if I'm home)
* Hair dryer (My hair gets weird if I dont dry it using a hair dryer
* \*Electric\* toothbrush (Can't really go back a normal one once having made the switch)
Of the 1000 most common words in the Dano-Norwegian dictionary 15-20% is German in origin, so a lot
Even basic words like "become/remain" is from Middle Low German "blîven" partially replacing the native word in many dialects
Depends a bit on the ideology and dialect though, as some purist movements want to avoid German vocabulary
Nynorsk prefers fewer for example
The wonderful term *prügelknabe*, which means whipping boy
Metaphorically, it means "scapegoat", or "preferred hate object".
"Weltschmertz" is a fine word too
Personally, I use "Scheisse" a lot
Occasionally "verdammt".
Sprachbung, sprachraum, bestilling, kanserleri, Kleiner Vorsterländer, Nazi (does it count
), Panserkampvogn (Panzerkampfwagen), Folkevogn/Volkswagen, Lettland, and many more, as both the languages of course are germanic
>Handy
[Wo ist mein Handy
Ich habe mein Handy verloren
:\(]
Krieg (krig) Bunker Kaputt Besteck (bestikk) Probably a lot more since we are a germanic language, but those are the ones i couls think of right now
Yes, those two
In that order
The effect that German (particularly Low-German) has had on the Scandinavian languages is just astounding
People sometimes compare it to the French influence on English
It's nearly impossible for two Norwegians to have a simple two minute conversation without using a single word of German origin
Agreed; it's not possible to have a two minute conversation without bringing up weltschmerz
But is that something we've loaned from german, or is it just from the same root
The Old Norse word was "verða", which some have preserved
So to "become" you can say both:
bli(ve) - blir - blei - blitt
verte - vert - vart - vorte
Or more weirdly, many have mixed the words:
bli - blir - vart - vorte
That, and also *veldig*, *viss* (if), *kanskje* and *bli*. Without having checked the numbers on this, I'm guessing that the average Norwegian sentence probably contains about one or two German loanwords
We certainly have a lot of common Germanic words, including *hand, hund, boge* and *du*, but additionally, we have a bunch of Low German loanwords that we adopted starting from around the 1300s. This includes a lot of common words, such as *reise, ære, begrave* and *hemmelegheit*. The number of such loanwords is definitely in the hundreds, if not the thousands
You can read more about it here: [
In Norway I believe the pure "verte" form is only found in parts of the west, and a couple archaic places in the east and trøndelag
The mixed system is quite standard in the whole country except south of Oslo and some northern places I think though
You don't need to go far from Oslo before people start saying "du vart".
vaɽ in present tense in Trøndelag is noted, but I think it is extinct except as an subjunctive of sorts
The only infinitive form I've seen from here is actually "vårtå".
It's much more common than it was 10 years ago, and has been pretty normalized
[I have shoulder length hair,] and I tend to get comments from two groups of people
Older men in my family, 50 and above, who asks me when I'm planning to cut my hair
And younger women in my social circles, 20-30, who gives me compliments
One of those groups have a larger sway on my hair style than the other
I would say the fashion at the moment is more long beards
But a man with long hair is not turning heads
It's common enough
I see some from time to time, pretty shure no one care either way
Its just hair, right
Kneler, directly translated to "kneeling" or "the kneeler".
Actually I think mostly just English and the Scandinavian languages use "what" for this kind of questions
I'm always tempted to answer "how do you call xxx" questions with "using a telephone" or some other crap

Oh Bella ciao Bella ciao Bella CIAO CIAO CIAO
Is it that one
That we are a part of Sweden
I've actually told an American I met online that I was from Norway and he replied with "Oh, so you're Swedish
He didn't even mean it as a joke
He was deadass serious
I wonder how many times I’ve heard that I live in Sweden
And that Oslo is a town in Sweden
Did you ask if he was Canadian or maybe Bolivian
It’s more like that Danish and Swedish are that close to Norwegian that we understand them the same way we understand dialects of our own language
Swedish btw is pretty different in many ways, with many influences of German
Some dialects of all three languages can be hard anyway to understand though
Nope but I definitely should have
Missed opportunity right there
We shot the largest traitor of the war, Vidkun Quisling
The rest were probably thrown in jail for a long time or life time
Here, those women who actually married Germans lost their citizenship
Shameful
There were quite a few young women who married their German sweethearts after the war, even knowing the consequences
I've read a few interviews with the few surviving women - they say they do not regret marrying the love of their life, but very much regret the toll it took on their families, and the hassle of having to apply specially for the kids to visit their maternal grandparents and such
And these were not actual collaborators or anything
Those were tried for their crimes
These were just young women who had fallen in love with equally young men, particularly towards the end of the war, when a lot of young men were drafted and sent abroad
Terrified kids who didn't particularly want to be in the war, but who were given no choice and luckily made friends when they were stationed in Norway
It was bound to happen

* company pays for internet access
* flexible hours, core hours are 9-2:30
* 1
5 hours a week for exercise during work hours
* 7 hour work day during summer (7
75 during winter so it averages out to 7
* one extra week of vacation, for a total of 5 weeks (4 weeks are guaranteed by law but many have a fifth week)
* 8 sick days in a row for a total of up to 24 sick days total in a year, before needing a doctor's note (also a common benefit here)
Probably some more minor stuff I'm forgetting
Of course there's also a lot that I get from the government and not the workplace per se, like the 5 month paternity leave I'm currently enjoying,
It's different here then
Free time is free time, you're not expected to do work when off the clock
That said, we do have to tax benefits like this, it's not 100% free
Back when I had a boss, I wouldn't have answered the phone at all if he called me in my free time
Don't underestimate being able to use the internet and read books when its not busy
Sounds like the perfect job to me
By the way, do you have paid sick leave in Bulgaria
Flexible hours is the best benefit
Can also be a curse
It kind of depends
Do you have paid sick leave
Dont you have paid sick leave
Dont worry, you have all the freedoms and guns
> Unlimited time off
paid
> Edit: This is not representative of most Americans
My benefits are better than ~95% of the country
Consider yourself blessed
I recently looked into how many US citizens have a real choice when it comes to health insurance
The number turns out to be **really** low
Since many either cant afford insurance, or they are under-insured (cheap insurance but they then cant afford the out of pocket cost), or they have medicaid, or they have mediare and cant afford extra insurance on top of that (even if experts recommend all to get it), or they re stuck in a job that only offer one kind of health insurance
So its surprising that so many cling to the notion that there is actual choice for most people
But you seem to be one of them, and I am genuinely happy for you
> it’s really hard for me to find ways to spend my time of I take all five weeks vacation in a year
Americans are the weirdest people
How can you not know how to just relax for a few weeks
Yes
Well, yes sorta
It does happen that I take the occasional work call or message etc
But overall, my colleagues would be hesistant to call after hours or if they know I have the day off
I would be perfectly within reason to tell them to call me about it tomorrow if it's not aomething very urgent
We're not inflexible, but we value the work/life balance
As for personal stuff at work, everyone is fine with you doing the occasional call etc while at work
Now, this might be different in other workplaces, as I've worked at a call center when I was younger, and that stuff was hell on earth compared to the public sector job I have now
I'm not saying I procrastinate all day, but nobody would bat an eye if I took 10minute longer break
So, it differs a bit between sectors
I don't have a spouse, but my gf never called me during work hours, so it wasn't really an issue
If she had called me during work hours, I'd know that it was some really serious shit, so yeah, I would answer
But that's the difference between your boss and your gf
If your gf/spouse has an emergency, it takes precedence over anything job related, but not vice versa
Then again, my boss would never call me in my free time anyway, because he understood the difference between work hours and free time, as all bosses should
Not the same person - but yeah, now that I think about it, free time is holy but work hours aren't.
Brilliant
It can be tempting to leave early and catch up later in the week
Later in the week you wish you hadn't left early the previous days
But yes - the advantages do outnumber the disadvantages
> They are forced to do it
And that is how it needs to be
If it wasn't forced Europe would end up like USA - where low paid jobs would have no benefits at all
Do you have savings
smart
Yeah I understand why you would work so hard then
I've heard US student loans are very high
Are these plants actually in the dictionary as words
I looked them up in Norwegian and yes, they are names for species, but they are not recognised as words in ‘officially’.
Ooooops, I must’ve mispelled it, as that is what I consider the actual dictionary
Thanks
Random drunk well-coordinated choral outbursts are a plague in the bars and pubs of Reykjavík
Not really no
I would say it's more common for drunk people to travel by taxi
I've been riding the bus home drunk many a time, and I'd say 40-50% of the times there have been allsang
Then I'm obviously either taking the bus at the wrong times, OR I live in the wrong town
If Icelandic counts, it's not intelligible spoken, but I can just about get the gist of written Icelandic if I really try
Faroese is hard, but you can kinda read and understand them if they talk slowly about simple things
But once they get going about stuff they have other words for it's impossible
Icelandic is impossible besides a few words here and there
American Norwegian is fun
You have those that seem to remember it or re-learn it through writing and have kinda eastern dialects with american influence
And then you have those who kept on talking their old dialects, with a fun mix of
American R, retroflexes, cases and american vocabulary like "car" and "farm".
Yes, Icelandic is barely understandable
The Kvens that went north to current Norway back in the day perhaps
Aren't you guys taught Danish though
We only briefly touched on Old Norse in school, and never Icelandic
That's not a spoken language though
I'm sure that "singing" is very dialect dependent
I can think of several dialects which nobody would ever think of as "singing". I can understand it for standard eastern Norwegian though
Neither of them are spoken
They are both strictly written languages
Spoken Norwegian is hundreds of different dialects
Mostly the latter
Bokmål is not that far from certain dialects in and near Oslo (and parts of Finnmark), and Nynorsk is quite similar to dialects found in fjords north of Bergen
That being said, grammar in local dialects can differ a bit from either of the two written standards
As for use, about 90% have Bokmål as their written standard, while ~10% use Nynorsk
All written material should be in either of those, but lots of Norwegians are terrible at grammar and spelling, so there's quite a few people (especially online) who write a bastardized mix of one of the written standards and their dialect, or just go "fuck it" and write their dialect
If you visit /r/norge on a regular day, I'd say about 20% of the posts there are either bad Norwegian or their own interpretation of the language (aka their dialect in writing)
Edit: 20% is probably more correct
Probably 17th May 1814 when we got our constitution and became independent for the first time in over 400 years (until a few weeks later when Sweden started a war against us and forced us into a union, but we were still considered our own nation in the union because of the constitution)
The day is still our most celebrated holiday, with huge parades, parties, national costumes and lots of flag-waving
It might have been being under the rule of Denmark and Sweden for so long
It made Norwegians cling to their national identity much more than what I think we would have done if we were independent the whole time
[Just look at how we dress on our constitution day while carrying around a flag each
] None of the other Nordic countries do this
**Edit:** Since OP mentioned WW2
During the war it was illegal to celebrate constitution day
Even in Sweden Norwegians were not allowed to celebrate
This because Swedish authorities were afraid that Swedes would join the parade (Stockholm) and that it would be viewed as demonstrations by Germany
[Source] So when we were finally free again and were allowed to do parades carrying our flag it meant more to us than ever before
Some info on the Swedish-Norwegian Union:
It was only a 'personal union' where Norway and Sweden had a common King and a common foreign policy (aka
completely run by the Swedes)
For all other intents and purposes we where separate countries
In contrast,  Norway was governed from Copenhagen (by Norwegians and Danes) before 1814
Fårikål, I just can't stand it
But the way the smell linger in the house after you make it is the worst part
Pinnekjøtt
Most popular Christmas dish here
It’s just super salty dry meat
Served with boiled potatoes and a light salty sauces (usually mostly jus from the meat) the whole meal is just a mixture of salty, bland, and dry
Including black olives
I hate green olives but i love the black ones
Hard disagree
This is the way
Nobel Peace Center is a must for anyone
Literally just anyone
Fram and Kon-Tiki museums are cool, and if you're into viking-things then the Viking ship museum is a good one as well (but it's small and packed with tourists)
I can't speak for other cities than Oslo though
As someone who comes from Drøbak, I would like to add in Oscarsborg fortress as well
We don’t have it at all
Although we have mcdonalds, burger kings, starbucks, a few dominos
We have quite the amount of pizza shops actually, although dominos is at the bottom of that list
What I am most surprised about is that we don’t have really any place that serves tacos
We love our tacos here and the only thing I can remember is tacopedia, which went bankrupt after a short while
Doesn't exist, which is a shame, because indojt mind a bit of fried chicken once in a while
But I probably only think that because we don't have it as an option
You got Los Tacos rolling out a few joints in Oslo lately, other than that there are some good “independent” ones around, but no country covering chains as I know
In Oslo there's a bunch of independent taco/Mexican restaurants that do well, but as you say, no taco fast food chain
Wait you guys have Taco Bell and Pizza Hut
I am jealous
In Norway the only international fast food chains we have is McDonalds, Burgerking, Dominos and Max
No, they are still around
They were bought up
Yes, to some degree
The basics are seen as fundamental
We learn some stuff in primary school and middle school (I think it was one year each)
It’s not common to eat at resultants for ordinary meals, of course we might do it sometime, but normally we eat at home, so being able to make some food for yourself that is going to sustain you is very important
However I can’t really make things totally from scratch, because I don’t bother
What I make is often just a little mixing and heating needed, like pasta, meat balls, soup and more
We learn it in school so yes, I would say it is a fundimental skill
> Even my grandma has observed this and throwing a tantrum from time to time "how lazy the women the women these days have gotten, they don't even know how to cook".
Let me guess, your grandma was a stay at home mom
Yes
What Sweden and Denmark says
That's impressive
Denmark definitely, and also Iceland to a slightly lesser degree
Denmark, Iceland, and the UK
You ARE our neighbouer
At my local training senter it says its 113 km over the sea to Denmark :)
I was in latvia on vacation a couple of years ago
Very beautiful :)
I mean, it's only because Denmark are so close to us, you're like way out in the ocean
Also having so few people kinda means most Norwegians have barely ever met a person from Iceland, whilst there are many Danes here and we often go there ourselves
I swear we like you just as much as the rest though, it's just we don't get to interact as often sadly :D
In Oslo you got different opportunities in terms of both more social life, more places to meet people, a pretty good restaurant scene, many different shops, cultural venues you don’t find anything like elsewhere in Norway and a lot of different jobs
Which is the capital city, though
Jerusalem or Tel Aviv
OK, thanks
So how does J differ from other significant cities
That's an interesting read
Thanks
No, not a thing at all
We have the «normal» lottery, but nothing special around Christmas og New Year
Poland: Cheap as hell
Everything cost like 1/3 of what the equivalent would be at home
I used to travel with my family a lot more than I do now, mostly because of time restraints for my father, so I don't remember everything too well, but here goes anyway:
Norway (I'm form here, but still feel like a tourist when I travel north and east): Mountains and the variety of museums in Oslo
Sweden: Only ever been to the airport in Stockholm (i think), but it was nice I guess
Denmark: Loads of theme parks like legoland, lalandia and fårup to name a few
Used to travel here almost twice a year at one point
Germany: Don't remember much other than Tropical Island and a holocaust museum i visited in 2015, but I have been there before that seeing the countryside
The Netherlands: Nice countryside, but it was to long ago to remember properly
France: Been there twice, first time I saw Omaha beach and Paris, second time I visited Nice and Antibes
Would have liked to these areas again now that I'm older and can appreciate and understand these attractions much better
Poland: Seeing the death camps there was quite an experience, would do again to explore more of the holocaust
Also got to see the castle and old town in Krakow as well as the salt mines outside the city
10/10 would do again
Czechia: Prague is a beautiful city, definitely want to visit again
Also wouldn't mind tasting some beer now that I'm old enough
Hungary: What I remember is nice bridges and a castle in the middle of the city
I will definitely be visiting again to explore the culture
Italy: Visited Rome once
Very nice, never realized how massive some of the old roman buildings were until i visited
Also never realized how beautiful (or small) the churches there are
I'm used to medium to bid sized protestant churches in Norway that are no way near as pretty
GB: London and Brighton were really nice
Got to see Stonehenge as well, and once again the scale surprised me
The British museum and imperial war museum where absolutely amazing to
Spain: Barcelona is an incredibly pretty city
Got to see the lasagrada familia (I definitively misspelled that, but oh well) and  Gaudí's home
The funniest part for me was that everyone was wearing winter coats while me and my family were sporting shorts and t-shirts (it was 15 degrees btw, aka: not cold) and swimming at the beach with people literally looking as we were the only ones doing it
> I got cute with the flags
Just an added detail, isn't it nice
It was very nice, it really made the post for me
Well done
We had [this thing] a couple years ago
Also [this thing] were money from the famous [NOKAS robbery] was said to be used
That's crazy, is there a book or some lengthy english articles on that
What if I told you Scandinavian police just do a piss poor job at busting higher up drug dealers
Except you know if they are idiots that shoot each other in the streets
What part of your country do you believe would be most likely to secede and why
I don't think there's any region even close to having anything resembling an independence movement, closest thing would maybe be Bergen though, they have a saying that goes "I'm not from Norway, I'm from Bergen"
Norway is very unified luckily
The chances of a part of the country breaking away is so small it's barely worth mentioning
People often joke about Bergen but it's nothing more than a joke
If I had to say somewhere it would be the Sami, although that would be difficult since nowadays they're a minority in almost every single municipality
The Sami have never wanted independence, although they have some autonomy in that they have their own Sami parliament
I guess if we manage to piss them off really hard for some reason that is the only way something like that could potentially happen in the future
But again I doubt it
They're likely much better off as a part of Norway than ever seceding
There are basically none independence movements though there is a joke about the city of Bergen going independent
But if I would have to pick one it would probably be a state for the Sàmi people though as far as I know there is no engagement for that
[Obligatory Berxit-ad] Really wished there was an English version or at least English subtitles because this ad is sooo good
I think Northern Norway is more likely to than Bergen, they've been dissatisfied with being governed from Oslo for years
It's amazing to me how the place names on the isles still are basically norwegian with strange spelling
I don't think we'd last too long as an independent state
I've never in my life seen a stray dog in Norway
I remember I was very surprised the first time I was in Turkey and saw a stray dog, and *so many* stray cats
Stray dogs are not a thing in Norway
Sometimes dogs run off, and occasionally there’s that one asshole that dumps their animal, but we don’t have a climate where stray dogs survive
They are either discovered quick, and caught, or they simply don’t survive
We do have stray cats
Very very few of them, but they exist
Cats run off, people are not as good at fixing them
They breed, have kittens, etc
That being said, stray cats are not *common* - and animal welfare organisations are aware of most areas with “colonisations”. Huge efforts are taken to capture these cats, fix them and re-home them
My experience is that stray cats are more common in very rural areas, but overall, not a problem in Norway
Can confirm, there are probably close to zero stray dogs in Norway
Cats, maybe, but probably very few
They are in Sweden
A small amount escaped in the seventies, now there's a few hundred thousand
Migrating to Norway too
We have a few cat colonies in my area, people here don't really care about preventing kittens
I hadn't heard about stray cat colonies until I moved here, where I grew up they were usually "dealt with" at first stray litter
Here I guess people think the cold in the winter will kill them anyway, so they don't care
I sell a lot of pens
It seems to be about 50/50 black or blue
I prefer blue
My husband prefers black
I would use either black or blue, whatever pen I find works
I prefer black
My handwriting is so shit that I try to limit all other factors that could lead to less readbility
Blue ink being one of them
Not common here either, at least not when I was a kid and probably still not
The only time another parent might join would be if they were friends of the host family or if a kid for different reasons needed their parent to be with them
But these are exceptions
I also feel like the parents at birthday parties on American tv are more visible/present when the kids are a bit older and don’t need the parents to be in the room
Not sure if it’s just tv or reality over there
I have a bonus question: is it common in other countries to have one “kid birthday” with friends as described in this post and then another “adult birthday”/“family birthday” with family
I never went to a kid's party where parents stayed longer than just dropping off the town kids
I stayed at the party ones, when by daugther was 3 years old
All the parents drank coffee while the host parents played with the kids
That is the only time though
All the rest of the birthdays we dropped the kids off and picked them up again
So I would say it might happen when the kids are 3 or younger
After that not so common
When the kids are young the parents would usually stay there with them but as the kids get older the parents would just deliver and return them
Only the kids
Let's say the party starts at 6 and ends at 8
Parents will drop off their kids at their friends party and pick them up when a party ends
One year, almost no family members came the same day, so in total with family parties and a friends birthday party I had 4 or 5 birthday parties in the span of 3 weeks
Tell me about it
i hosted my little brothers 6th birthday because my parents were going through some stuff and couldn't do it themselves
20+ 6 year olds running around the house high on sugar
So not a birthday, but a birthweek
Yes, in Norway we are commiting an entire chapter in the norwegian subject about different dialects, social lects (if thats a word), geolects and language differences between countries in Scandinavia
We literally had a hour in school where we learned about the different ways to say letters, like open or closed mouths, or where the tongue is placed when you say the letter L.
And we are also learning about how norwegian was earlier
My group analysed the differences between Nynorsk and Bokmål (our 2 different written languages), and some friends analysed the Norse, Old Norwegian and our language today
Yes
First of all we have two ways of writing Norwegian
And the dialects
oh boy don’t get me started
I remember we had to listen to a tape and mark on the map where the dialect was from
I failed big time
Man i do not want to remember that part, Analyzing dialects, a doll house and karen
Absolutely awful, and there's so many of them, we even have two different written forms
To illustrate my point just compare the next to sentences
Jeg går i a jeg og
Æ e i a æ å
Those say exactly the same
Edit: Translated it is “Im also in class A”
One of our teachers even went further and demanded that we read old norse and Icelandic, as if learning Swedish and danish too wasn't shitty enough
It's part of school for everyone
Norwegian has a lot of varied dialects and no standard dialect so they're an important part of people's identities
> Probably just because we don't have strong dialects (except elfdalian
That's not true
Sweden has stronger and more interesting dialects  than in Norway, just look at Västerbotten, Skåne, Värmland, Gotland, the other Dalmål around Elfdalian, etc
Problem is they seem to be dying out and replaced with a standard language because they have been suppressed much more
>  Analyzing dialects, ~~a doll house and karen~~.
> One of our teachers even went further and demanded that we read old norse and Icelandic
That's the fun part of Norwegian class though
To add alot of childrens shows use a variety of dialects so you are exposed to them at a young age
> As for elfdalian, there is a very strong argument to be made that it's a separate language as well although much closer to Swedish than Sami of course
I don't get why everyone only speaks of Elfdalian when there are plenty of Dalmål very similar to Elfdalian
Are they also languages or not
Yeah, it wasn’t the worst
But when the teacher just wrote that into the termtest none were happy, and she was disappointed that no one got it right
It’s lovely to work with but horrendous to do without proper knowledge
People tend to understand most, if not all the dialects
Some small dialects that is not heard ofte might be harder but its rare
> The thing about Swedish dialects though is that in many cases, the only difference between one dialect and another is the pronunciation
Of course there are some dialects like elfdalian which differs a lot from Rikssvenska (RP Swedish) with both vocabulary and pronunciation, but they're definitely in the minority
This is the difference between genuine dialects and newer accents
Traditional dialects had a lot more differences, while newer ones are just standard Swedish with an accent
On my trips to study dialects I often only find old people speaking the genuine dialects
For example in Halland they used to have verb plurals
"jak ska, vi skullum", Jamtland had cases "i huset" vs "i husan". Etc
and hungarian
> Modern day Elfdalian is quite similar yes, but historically the area around Älvdalen specifically was quite different from the rest if I understand it correctly
Not much different from its neighbours
Only the germanic nasal vowels I think are peculiar just to them
> Keeping the old Norse grammatical case system
A similar grammatical system with 3 cases is found in it's neighbours as well
Same for verbs and adjectives
Compare the two dialects from Älvdalen and Orsa in how they say "calf":
Elfalian | Sing

>I've been wondering about this
Do Norwegian actors often (or at all) change their dialects
Yes, it is quite common, and especially so for periodic dramas
In such cases it is almost always the case that the dialect they switch to is Oslo dialect, which is easy to impersonate, because it is so often heard in media
> that a child at least speaks a dialect that resembles (one of) their parent's dialect
Absolutely, no serious movie would show a child having a different dialect from its parents without a good reason
>Or that an actor is supposed to play a farmer from county X.
Not to a very large degree, but somewhat, yes
It's kind of "rude" (not the best word for it) to associate a dialect with stereotypes, especially in media
Fun fact: The dialects east of Oslo (Østfold) have a quite negative image
Many people associate it with ignorant farmers, and news anchors from there usually make a determined switch to the Oslo dialect to avoid the negative connotations (the difference between the two is pretty much just pronounciation, though)
No they arnt
I love coronation chicken
With raisins
I love Italian sandwiches with porchetta or mozzarella, pesto and tomatos
Norwegian style ones are decent as well - mayo, shrimps and lemon or skagenrøre
Avocado, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon
Peanut Butter and Jelly
Socialist People's Party (7>14) doubled their seats
Dang
The less left radical party, Radical Left, also doubled their seats (8>16)
But honestly best of all it is to see Danish People's Party (right wing populist) tumble from glory to gutter
And polls show that Norway is next
Red (socialist/social democrat) and Socialist Left (socialist/social democrat) is growing, and Progress Party (populist right) is dropping like a rock even measuring below Red on a few polls
You're just adapting to the future before it comes
Why would a career politician use the wrong definition
Seems sketchy to me
Why not Liechtenstein
Germany
But neither of them would be a bad choice
Just too bad my German is horrible
Probably Germany since I have a few friends there
Austria-we were once them
just a general question, what do hungarians feel about austria, and vice versa
like in regards to the former empire
I get you Finland
I live 10 min from the ocean, and that is far enough
I guess we tend to prefer what we are used to
The thing about UK is that your trains are super expensive
Basically everyting is much cheaper than norway, but the train and bus costs about the same
really strange, annoyed me when I lived there lol
Rather expensive especially on longer distances, but short distances aren’t particularly cheap either
More than €10 for a 30 minutes ride into Oslo on a suburban train and €50-70 one way isn’t unusual on more regional and longer distance trains
Yep, our trains are expensive and slow, yet heavily subsidised
It would be much more efficient to shut down some of the lines and invest in better roads
(Essentially, trains are mostly only effective if the passenger volume is  high
Which rules out most of norway except eastern part
Other parts of Europe, however, has high volume
The train budget is huge
Just 30% less than the road budget
The train ticket is subsidised and the plane ticket has high extra taxes
Yet, Oslo-Trondheim and Oslo-Bergen are on the top 10 bussiest flights in Europe (Bergen and Trondheim have like ~200k inhabitants
Trondheim-Oslo is the same distance as Gothenburg-Stockholm, but takes more than twice the time and is more expensive
Sorry for the rant
I just think technology should be judged based on its strengths and weaknesses, not because it has long historical roots
And btw, the new technologies that are coming in the next 10-30 years will make trains in norway look even more silly
Those technologies are better batteries for EV's and busses, cheaper vehicles, self-driven cars, electric planes (for short distances like oslo-trondheim & Oslo-bergen)
haha that's nice to hear, I live in bergen with family from oslo and have a fear of flying, so I take Bergen line very often
it's not too bad, relatively to, say a pint of milk
but newcastle for a tenner is unbelievable
I’m all in favour of trains and believe in trains and other rail solutions for the future
Having a solution where you transport more people together on the same distances makes more sense than having everyone in their own car, especially in and out of cities and within them
The problem in Norway is that we don’t put enough into our train lines and don’t do efficient work and investments
Instead they break the system up even more into different companies sucking more money making everything more expensive
In addition they don’t concentrate about one line or area at once and get it done
Several central and critical lines and projects should’ve been prioritised, like the only train tunnel through Oslo which only got two tracks since 1980
It’s also a matter of being realistic, there will never be a high speed line to Bergen
Why
Because of the nature
Instead there can be faster lines to say Stockholm and south to Kristiansand
Other countries with just as difficult topography has succeeded for a long time and we should look at them
Roads don’t help me much as I don’t drive and I hate traffic and roads and all about it
The planned road projects in this country are often insane, especially the plans about E39
We plan on scrapping roads which were new a decade ago, erasing more forest and fields
We tried enough Americanisation decades ago and it left enough scars
It's so funny when German people complain about DB
First world problems
DB is way better and cheaper than many other European train companies
I'm all for trains as long as the (public budget) cost per passenger-kilometer is less than 3x the cost of the alternatives
Very actively trying to relocate government offices outside of the capital
It feels like it's become a sin to have an office in the capital
They are everywhere in Norway
The government with is ministries and the supreme Court are in Oslo
The register of businesses is located in Brønnøysund, which is a tiny village in the North
The National agency for planning and building roads is in Kristiansand
The Norwegian School of Economics is in Bergen
And as a fellow Norwegian said, it feels like it's almost a sin to have a government office in the capital now
They're trying to close the police academy in Oslo now
The less attractive your town is to live in, the more likely it is to get a government office
Ever want to go to Brønnøysund or Mo i Rana
> he less attractive your town is to live in, the more likely it is to get a government office
So that's why most why Oslo got so many
:) Sure, some government jobs have been moved out of the capital, but Oslo still gets a very large share (and the most powerful ones)
Going to have to go with [Villanden By Ibsen] its a play, but its so boring, and having to interpret that the duck is symbolic for the girl
It still haunts me
Oh yeah fuck that
They really wanted us to think it was the best, most interesting and deepest too
They made us watch the play
So unbelievably boring
God damn it
Did you have to remind us that book exists :’D
I have never heard of a required reading program or anything like that here in Norway, and I'm currently a university student with all 13 years of public school behind me
Did everyone else get forced to read specific books
We usually read whatever we wanted, except for when the teacher read "Det angår også deg" for us in ninth grade
Did they make you see the version that seemed to be recorded in the 60s too
The only thing I remember about it is
there were walls and furniture
Awesome play
Yes, we had to study the different big authors
Ibsen and Hamsund
Did you not have to read sult in Norwegian class
If they did I forgot
Haha
Nah
We saw the movie, though
I think you got off easy
Most of us had to see the movie AFTER we read the book
Stor uff
I literally got a r/me_irl post after this and someone said "all I wanna say is "ehre (confusing German)"".
Well if you're from the interior of Russia or turkey you're not really European either though
"Switzerland isn't fucking insane, checkmate"
There's a few things that's important to notice if you compare the levels of disposable income between Western Europe and the US
Europeans doesn't really need to invest as much as Americans
Some of us live in countries with public pension plans
We might (should, in my opinion) have additional private plans as well, but the necessary savings to live comfortable lives in old age can't compare to a 401k plan
Many of us also doesn't really need to save for college for our kids, and since we have public healthcase our emergency funds needn't be that high
In some countries housing cooperations even offer life time leases, reducing the need for property investments
All in all, we may have lower disposable income than the average middle class American, but our need to save  invest is also lower (except for the Germans, they do it out of national habit)
Another factor is that these things vary between the countries
In my country the opportunities for investment and saving are quite good
Interest is low, and banks compete to lend us money
Capital gains tax are at 22%. Our total tax rate on income (including VAT) might seem high for Americans, but since I already have a public pension plan as well as private pension, our kids have no tuition to pay and health care is virtually free I may divest most of what's left  to things that's more fun to own
My biggest investment is my house
It's been ever increasing in value since I bought it in 2010, and is now valued at 650k USD
My remaining mortgage is just a fraction of that I also own some stocks and index funds that is basically just a method to put aside money for fun stuff
I also consider buying a cabin in the mountains
The reason I can do that is twofold:
1) Both my wife and I have higher education, and we earn slightly above the median income
Pooled together that income is quite high, placing us in the upper middle class income bracket
Double income households have huge amounts of disposable income compared to others, even though we only earn slightly more than the median
And households where both earners have higher education (ie Master's degree)  have an additional advantage on others in this respect
2) The tax system is rigged to promote investments in private property
Since World War II it's been an official policy that most Norwegians should own their own homes
Since the early 2000s low interests in combination with tax incentives has promoted an ever-ongoing property boom (as in many other countries) but with the high rates of home ownership the wealth accumulation of certain classes have increased substantially
Isn't that just for public sector employees
Over here, ALL employees gets a public pension through mandatory membership in a public insurance scheme called *Folketrygden
* A share of your taxes are paid as membership fees which in turn gives access to public health services, unemployment benefits, sick leave, parental leave as well as membership in a public pension plan
The public pension isn't really that good
Depending on the number of years you've worked you'll get anything from 36-50 % of your salary (and the salary calculations are capped at around USD 80k. Maximum payments are in other words around USD 40k)
In addition you'll get a pension plan paid from your employer
In the privat sector it can be anything from shitty (2% ) to good (7%)
The public sector have another system, which will guarantee 66% of the salary you had when you retired, which is an excellent plan
Thanks for letting me know, I didn't know that
I thought there was virtually no such things in the US
The maximum benefit isn't really that bad, it's quite good compared to many other nations
You've been listening too much to Bernie Sanders
Northern European Social Democracies are hypercapitalist export-oriented economies with a state-sponsored social security net
Taxes are low or non-existant on wealth, capital gains tax is low, and income tax is in the middle range
Welfare is funded by the working classes through membership in what's basically mandatory public insurance schemes granting benefits such as retirement, unemployment, disability, sick leave, parental leave as well as health care
In order to be eglible, you need to have an income
Income inequality are lower than for many other European countries, but wealth inequality is sky-high
In reality, income inequality is masked by the fact that  the upper middle class /lower upper class is  smaller than in many other countries
On the other side: The number of billionaires and multi-national companies per capita is way higher than in many other comparable nations, creating small elites that have abundance of cash
Same thing here
Pensions will also be paid by a fraction to the remaining spouse if you die
The financing is a bit different though
The base tax rate is a flat 22% on all income and capital gains
Employees have to pay an additional 8
1 % tax  on all income before deductions, that goes towards all public benefits (retirement, unemployment, parental leave, sick leave and universal health care)
On top of that high salaried employees pay a marginal tax of 9 % on income above USD 65k.
Since most people have lots of deductions (namely interest rates and children) a citizen with an average income will pay around 30-33 % in tax, where 8 % goes toward public benefit
Needless to say, the system is underfinanced and is kept up by contributions from the government
>No, I haven't. In fact, I dislike Bernie and his policies, and am a proud Biden-Harris Democrat
Sorry, I didn't mean to imply anything
I'm just a bit tired of the image quite a few Americans have of the Nordic countries, promoted by Sanders' rather exaggerated democratic socialist claims about our societies
There's very few S550 AMGs over here, but there are a lot of Teslas, high-end Audis and Volvos
Cars that easily costs around USD 100k.
The reason behind this is twofold:
1) Interest is low, and many have easy access to credit
Tesla even offered 100 % financing for .95% a while back
If you have a steady salary, you can easily afford such a car
2) Cars are taxed, but not by value
Electric cars are completely untaxed, there's not even VAT
Fossil cars are taxed by emissions
And since high-end cars often emit less than cheap cars the proportion of the tax is lower the more expensive the car get
You can by a cheap Dacia and 50% of the price will be tax
Or you can by a more expensive Audi and perhaps 25 % of the cost will be taxes
Guess what people do :-)
Happens all the time
I estimate that Norway within the next 100 years will speak 50/50 Norwegian/English
I forget words all the time
Sometimes I remember the English translation, sometimes don't.
All the time
My sentences are usually a mix of Norwegian and English words
Happens to me quite frequently as well for the same reasons
Last week on my finals I forgot the Norwegian word for "property". Luckily most people here know a lot of English so I can just say it in English and they'll understand most of the time
I agree that it's incredibly embarrassing
I hope not
Personally I think we should do as the Icelanders do and keep Norwegianify our loan words and do our utmost to keep our language traditional, maybe even go further from Bokmål over to Nynorsk
I think of language as a piece of history and how cool it would be to keep it constant without much change
Us in the Nordics don't translate our media and whenever a good idiom is mentioned I will remember it, but it just doesn't have the same charm in my own language
I completely agree with you
But I'm afraid we are already on a slippery slope there
Just listen to how children as young as 12-13 speak now
Lots of English mixed in
Even their prononciation of many words differ from how they would learn it in school
They can't say words like "kjøtt, kino, skjegg, kjøpe" how they are supposed to sound
And it just sounds weird to me
I'm from the west coast from an area with a very strong kj-sound
And now many young people say "skjøkken" instead of "kjøkken". So I know exactly what you mean
But then again languages have always been evolving all through the time (we would not be able to understand the Vikings now for instance
) So I guess in a way we just need to except what is coming
No one's saying Faroese :(
Norwegian
Where’s my Faroese friends at
I'm unsure what you mean about us making every statement a question
Takk
When it mattered the most, you forgot your policy of neutrality smh
Back at ya, brother (or sister
Agree
As a norwegian i agree, totally depends on the dialect tho
Yeah but you don't have other sounds for variation
Correct
So you’re left with only Northern Norwegian then
Denmark
Are you ok
Omg Denmark are you choking
It does
I don't think it does in my ^accent ^^at ^^^least
Tak means roof :)
It’s because we don’t speak with an apple or potato in our mouth
Takk = short vocal
Tak = long vocal
Because "Tak" is roof
What's weird is that there's an entire nation of choking people who still somehow don't die
... oh my god, Denmark is actually full of undead
There’s such a thing
Denmark, I've told you a billion times
We broke up 205 years ago
Get over it
Jk love you I dumped that "Sweden" guy
Love it haha
It wasn't higher pitched really
Highest point in the sentence for me was the 'a' in 'katten'.
Actually
I’m from northern Norway, and to me Danish has more of a high pitch at the end of a sentence than what I’m used to in my dialect
We in fact tend to go down at the end of sentences here in the north
This is why I always feel overlooked when people comment on what “Norwegian” sounds like, because it doesn’t apply to me
;-;
How do I say them after each other
Um, because I do
I don’t know, it’s just how our language works
When I say “tak” I drag out the a.
When I say “takk” the “pressure” isn’t on the a, but the k.
A double consonant means the wowel before it is short
A single consonant means the wowel before it is long
Oh yes
Neat idea
Same
Our national sub is mostly crap, I for one am not on there at all
NRK1, the main channel of the public broadcasting corporation
We have the same word for door and dies, *dør*. Not annoying to me but I find it funny
we have so little vocabulary compared to english
like say colour, there’s no way to say crimson, auburn, cerulean, viridian, maroon, etc
there’s no translation for words such as eerie and eldritch
The accent many/most native speakers get when they try to speak some English (unfortunately including me)
Otherwise I'm quite indifferent about the language
There's plenty of vocabulary
It's not the best way measure, but our dictionary is one of the ones with the most words
Colours are always difficult to traslate between cultures though
This is not true
There are Norwegian dictionaries that exceed the word count of corresponding English ones
And many of the words you mentioned do exist, but they are just not as commonly used
hahahah, nice one
Same thing, I forgot about it
Lik is the word
happy marriage if Norway, Sweden and Denmark merged
Albania
Merging with Kosovo
Countries are already in the talks about that
Macedonia could work out, seeing as 25% of the population is Albanian, and both countries havw good relationships
Montenegro; well, I think they wouldn’t like it, but us Albanians would, considering we have many people living there
Greece; simply no, for the best of everyone
Civil War, Balkan War 0
Been there done that
But this time we have oil
So nope
We get to marry Sweden, the world's prettiest girl
Yeeaaaay
> Russia: Over my dead body
Do anyone want to anymore
Hey, you go east, we get to keep Sweden
What about russia
^Å ^faen
We used to be that divorce child living some hundred years with one of our parents in shifts after all

i love you too Finland, but the language differances may lead to domestic violence
Don’t you guys make enough out of your fancy lamps, furniture, other design stuff and tv-series
I love you too Iceland, you could probably join and teach us some old norse like in the good old days:)
We dominating
Thank you
I believe this mix would become a more analytical language with less inflections like English
Even German and Icelandic are changing by losing the dative case
What is Babiš doing
Liberalism and communism are almost exact opposites
They asked about the closest
We have to go by boat to Denmark
They're pretty great people, too, though
Norway's lost kid returns :)
We’re trying yes
It's like the opposite of Welsh
Because they understand norwegian, we used to be very cruel towards them from the 19th-20th century, but what i meant by domestic violence is that there will be a lot of trouble because of our differances, but you guys know swedish right
so i think we can overcome our language differances
The Nordic Federation will rise
but in switzerland not every language is mandatory right
if its not i can't even imagine not understanding your fellow countrymen :/
Then leave, eliminate the negativity from your life
It can only get better
We do call tadpoles for rumpetroll (butt-trolls) though, which is even better
Best part is that the peak of Finland’s highest mountain is in Norway
The highest point of Finland is on a ledge on it, and in time of the finish Independence Day there were talks about giving them the mountain
He could be younger than 2003
I am born in 2004
I think there are probably better ways to solve that than providing school lunches
Then you are still left with kids only getting one meal a day and presumable the rest of the family still suffering from lack of food
Yeah but you would have to pay for it, like you can get milk and (used to) be able to get fruit, but all of that you have to pay for
So if they don’t have food, idk how they would pay for it
Or maybe it would be some other way of doing than the milk/fruit stuff
Yeah, the constitution explicitly states that we are an united country without a possibility to split
If there are enough seats around the main table then no, but if not then we do make a kids table
We used to have that for birthday parties with the family
The four of us cousins would be at our own table for the past 20ish years and now we just don't do much for our birthdays
Depends on the family, amount of tables and children (also their ages)
During my best friends wedding her and her new husband + me sat with most of the kids and the “adults” was at other tables
But that was just because they didn’t have any place settings and no one dared to sit with the bride and groom so the kids did
It was honestly quite a lot of fun
It depends on the day for my family
For example on the 23rd all the kids and teenagers  sit and eat rice porridge on a separate table, but on the 24th everyone eats together
I'd love to walk around a live comedy show in a nondescript uniform, asking people that question ("what is the joke and why do you find it amusing
") and writing down their responses on a formal-looking notepad
My tailor is rich
Luckily not
Nope, just throw away  any wrappers in a garbage bin when you're done and we're good
"Did you ever go to a place…I think it was called Norway
"No,” said Arthur, “no, I didn’t."

Won an award, you know
Lovely crinkly edges
We have 20 judges in our supreme court, but most cases are held with only 5 of them
I had to google it, and there are 20 judges in surpreme court
I count 21
Also worth mentioning is that the judges have to retire form the Supreme Court when they are 70 years old
It's random
Supreme Court cases aren't very politiziced here, the courts don't make law they only interpret it
Most disputes they settle are relatively uncontroversial and not that important in the grand scheme of things
If they expect an issue to be contentious, then it's heard by all the judges
Norwegian number convention adopt both the Danish and Swedish conventions
The Swedish is like English system were 54 fifty-four is said femtifire
The Danish system takes after the German convention, so I could also say, fireogfemti
Some old type number names can be used, like fireogtredve (34) as opposed to trettifire (34)
The Danish system is a sort of the 'old way' of doing things, though I myself find myself doing this form the most
(Oh but we dont use tres and halvtres like the danes, ever though, we use the "normal (Swedish
/Norwegian) names for numbers)
We used to say one and ten like the germans, but they changed it in the last century sometime
People still use the old way sometimes though, I dunno, it just feels better sometimes
They changed it in 1951:
Quite similar to Japanese and Chinese
Can add that the Swedish/English way only came about in 1951 in a reform, before then we used only the Danish/German way
> (Oh but we dont use tres and halvtres like the danes, ever though, we use the "normal (Swedish
/Norwegian) names for numbers)
It was actually used in Eastern Norway in the 19th century, though extinct today
Actually it’s almost only the English language that has  a billion (10^9) and not a milliard
A milliard is the more common name(in Europe anyway) [list]
Some of our former army camps are turned into camps for asylum seekers
Mostly surprised by the small amount of people who identify with Labour parties, which I assume to be equal to social democratic ones unless I'm misunderstanding things, compared to socialists
And also by the relatively high percentage of asexual people
Interesting results

Other than them, most Norwegian Hip Hop artists sing in Norwegian and is therefore little known outside of our borders
Maybe in Sweden/Denmark
**Heavy Metal**
I don't know much about this, but the band Mayhem was one of the early bands that formed the Norwegian heavy metal scene
They were very controversial because of their live performances, they encouraged burning churches, their vocalist commited suicide in 1991 and one former member murdered their guitarist in 1993
The early Norwegian black metal scene was also important as it is credited with creating the black metal-genre and it has created some very influential artists within the Extreme metal-genre
Markus and Martinus, i guess they did not go too big, but leafy made two videos on them back in the day, so I guess that is something
Other than that aha made it big with take on me
sangerinden er sgu fra norge
The guys who sang only shit about Eurovision *on Eurovision*?
I would add Nico & Vinz who were nr
1 in more than 100 countries with "Am I wrong".
Alexander Rybak and secret garden are also well known
[Wardruna] is pretty popular but maybe not exactly mainstream
Never heard of Secret Garden, but sure
Yes, he was born in England and moved to Dana outside of Bergen, Norway in 1999
His father is British and his mother is Norwegian so he counts :p
Never heard of him, but if he's reached all the way to Slovakia, then sure :)
Damn, was about to add Turbonegro but I didn't think they are big outside of Norway lol
Sissel who
Sissel is an ordinary first name :)
selv den Danske Wikipedia-side medgir at hun er Norsk hahah
ESC winners of the year you were born (?)
Sissel Kyrkjebø.
Oh, ok
I wasn't born in '95, but I get it :)
Bus:
If you are entering the bus at the front entrance where the driver is, you usually say hi, especially for those that have to stop and show the driver their ticket (not everyone needs to)
And if you exit at the front I think it’s nice to say bye, I usually do but lot of people don’t (I’m not sure but I think saying it is more common)
If you enter/exit at the back you obviously don’t say hi/bye
Other interactions are kind of similar:
At the grocery store you don’t acknowledge those who work there until it’s your turn to get your items scanned
Then you say hi (sometimes gets left out), then after they’ve scanned they’ll ask if you want a bag and if you want a receipt, which you reply to
Then you often
(not always, depends on the cashier too) say bye, but it might get left out sometimes(/often
Other types of stores, for example clothing stores, have similar interactions as grocery store, but it opens up for a bit more
Sometimes a store worker might say hi or ask if you need help, to which you respond and then continue what you were doing
Here I would say that you basically always say bye after your purchase
There’s also a bit more possibility of some very quick small talk (like a couple one liners), though it’s still not that common
Edit- added something
I always give a little farewell wave to the bus driver when I get off
Imo Danes are better at this than Norwegians, not that I always understand what is being said but often some words are coming when buying a coffee, beer or just standing in line
I always smile and give a little nod when I enter the bus, a shopor a cafeteria, as do many other Scandinavians
We might be less verbal in our social interaction than southern Europeans, but it is not like we're cold people ignoring each other
This is the way
I noticed people thanking the bus driver when I lived in Vancouver, Canada
People thought I was cold for not acknowledging them, but in Northern Europe you're not *supposed* to acknowledge them
Well what do people around you, excluding your friend groups, do
I do get the impression that the Danes maybe are a bit more “extroverted” than us, but this was kind of surprising, can I ask what type of banter/remarks
Banter with cashier and remarks while standing in queue is something I don’t see much, and when I see it it’s often talkative men, who usually seem to be in their 20/30s or 65/70+.
Not sure exactly what you meant by weekend nights, you mean at parties right
That’s common here too
In my experience Danes are generally very jovial and more outgoing than Norwegians or Swedes
All Danes I’ve ever met seems to live on banter lol
And the same stereotypes are overblown for Norwegian and Swedes too btw, but of course there is some truth to it
(So I tried to write a short reply, but I suck at doing that, so here’s a long reply before I go to bed:)
Okay that one doesn’t sound terrible, but its not really the norm and most probably wouldn’t say anything, though it totally depends on how slow and the situation
Basically I feel like there usually needs to be a good reason, like a threshold has to be reached
I would probably (exceptions can happen) only comment the queue if it was like the longest or weirdest queue I had seen, and I got eye contact with someone
Then I could be like “Oi
” while looking shocked, or say something like “wow that’s a long queue”. Haven’t done this though
One time I kind of just looked surprised/shocked  and got accidental eye contact with someone who was already standing in the queue, and they were like “yah” and gave sort of a half-nod to acknowledge the situation, then I smiled, and that was it
Another example
I’ve had buses arrive pretty late (10-20 min), and often no one says anything, so we all stand in silence
But a few times (or more) I’ve experienced someone saying something, almost always starting with a question
I’ve been on both ends
For example one person might ask if someone remembers when exactly the bus was coming, the other says the bus is really late, the first person shows they’re annoyed at the bus, and  the other acknowledges this feeling and says that it happens a lot
Sometimes the conversation is over after two lines, sometimes a few more lines
If it’s an elderly person it can very well be longer
Then when someone sees the bus they might go “now it’s coming” or “finally
One time we just stood in silence while the bus was 10 min or so late (so we had probably waited 15min)
But when I saw the bus I loudly said “yes
I feel like when the bus is like 10-15 min late, remarks and even some small talk is kind of acceptable, and it’s not strange if you air out your frustrations or make a joke about the situation
I wouldn’t have full fledged conversations with strangers in the store unless we were drunk (never happened though)
I’ve definitely had conversations with strangers on the bus when drunk
Flåklypa Grand Prix (Pinchcliff Grand Prix) and it's sequels are all very good and charming stop-motion films, but the first one is usually considered the best
The books they're based on are even better imo
A movie based on the Hakkebakkeskogen is also really good from what I've heard
Flåklypa Grand Prix
Only good Norwegian car movie ever made
Terkel I Knipe was a major hit here as well
Loved that movie
And the [music] is amazing
That’s the one where the devil eats a potato with his ass
Yeah, going to see that movie in the cinema inspired him to make cars
It also inspired George Lucas pod racing:
Wait "yr" means horny
I thought it was a weather thing
Yes it does, but it's quite old fashioned way of saying it
For example "våryr" is a thing in Norway
When people get "excited" in the springtime
Yep, but pronounced rather differently
Not popular at all
At least amongst younger generations
Maybe some will have some facial hair, like a closely shaved beard, but other than that it’s not very common
At least in the part of Norway I live in
I believe it might has something to do with the fact that Nordic hair is generally thinner than other hair types, so maybe it’s not as easy to grow
I am not a man though, so this is purely from my own observation
Maybe I just live in an area where no one really grows facial hair
It comes and goes
Norway is not that formal so you can usually get away with whatever
For me it's more a result of laziness than a fashion statement
It's pretty popular here
The beard I have is small but dense enough so I grow it out about 5 millimeters but if I could, I would have a full viking beard
It's quite normal, but it comes and goes
I'd say around a third of all men are bearded
I've had my big, red beard for about 15 years now
And I'm bald
Back then people believed I was some sort of biker or something
Now way more people have it, like 35% of all men under 50
Guesstimating tho
Got curious about what part of the country your from, has to be like west coast
Where people are very aesthetic in their stupid teslas
This is exactly like my experience
Are political moustaches still a thing
It's just more work
I'd get rid of it if I could
“Thor” is unfortunately not a historically correct documentary on Norse mythology
I am sorry to bring you this unfortunate fact:/
I’m from the east, west of Oslo, so I see plenty of people flexing in their Tesla’s and Porche’s. You’re not wrong there
I considered the fact that it might be more geological that decides wether it’s popular or not, so that’s probably it
Might be
Also a social thing I guess, I dont see many hip besteborgere with beards
Good God I hate you guys :)
That's so interesting
Would Erdogan's moustache count as an islamist moustache
It's surprising that a pun would be more expensive
They're usually not funny and should fit right in with German culture
We live in a sad world:(
You know, i hate a lot of the people here as well
So many people who just have to brag about money and brands and etc
It gets tiresome pretty quick
I'm happy to hear that, it is like the lowest form of existence imo
Always chasing that false feeling of approval from the fellow man, based upon having the latest and greatest
These far-from-reality fools are often people of power, and I guess that is the reason why so much blatant corruption and other stupid shit can go on here
Only in Norway, as they say
Sorry about ranting tho, good vibes intended
I see
Thank you
Ahaha no worries
We’ll be crying in the corner having nighrmares about Milinkovic-Savic and that damned qualifier against Serbia
I love the way Brazilian Portuguese sounds (at least some of the dialects)
I also like Spanish a lot - where the dialects spoken in Spain are my favourites
Japanese, Italian, and Finnish
Personally I don't understand Portuguese (apart from a few words) but sitting in a street Cafe in Porto and Lisbon listening to the locals talk was an amazing experience, I love the flow of the language, the near sensuality of it, the softness
It is beautiful
Brazilian Portuguese - not to the same extent, it sounds somewhat harsher to me when spoken
And of course English, which I do speak and write to the point where I sometimes wonder whether I'm expressing myself better in English than in Norwegian
Lastly I would also mention Catalan, very different from Spanish, and also a beautiful language, although with some harshness to it
And I also want to support it since the Spanish government tries its best to suppress it these days
A language should never be suppressed,  banned and destroyed like the Castilians are attempting to do, so for that reason alone it deserves a place on my list
I really like japanese, it has a nice ring to it :)
Greenlandic is my favourite, but Welsh is pretty cool aswell
Danish and Japanese
I have never hear snatch as "speaking" in norwegian
Snatch means snappe - steal/catch/grab in norwegian
Seems like that have changed the meaning in norwegian as well
Speaking is not listed as the norwegian meaning of the word anywhere
Definitely funnier, but I don’t know about nicer
Just think of their famous sweet bread topping: *haaaaagelslaaaaaag*
Beautiful
Japanese is really beautiful
Have you heard they are giving out all the ghibli movies on netflix now
I alredy have all of them on dvd, but its nice that more people can discover ghibli :)
I think chinese is pretty as well
Fall in love with chinese after watching Emperess in the palace on netflix
Thats makes sense :) Snakke means speak in norwegian
Its intresting to see how woven together languages are in europe
It’s almost as enchanting as someone whispering „Ik hou van jou” in my ear
Hageslange means garden hose in Norwegian and prob Danish
Hage means garden and Slange means snake
So makes sense that way
Kaiser Wilhelm II has taken a lot of the blame for WWI and is not viewed very favourably by history
But in Ålesund, Norway, he is still remembered for the aid he sent when the city burned in 1904
The city hall's address is _Keiser Wilhelms gate 11_.
Probably some Danish or Swedish kings
We have some history wit them and it usually didn't end so well for us
Well, like eveey vikingking
Sigurd Jorsalfare/the crusader massacred some darn muslims in the holy land, probably women
and children too
I mean, Saint Olaf is literary our national saint, but he massacred chieftain after chieftain opposing him, as well as burning farming families alive in their own housed, cooking opponements alive, cutting their bodies piece for peace, putting snakes into their throats and letting them bite their victim to death or till they come out, also having a mouse under a cup and putting a warm object onto the cup, panicing the mouse/rat to dig thru the living human the cup lies upon
He also **raped small girls**. He did all that stuff because he wanted pagans to convert to christianity and the slow convertion his father and other forefathers had begun was too slow
So yeah, that's why we celebrate him each year at Olsok etc, because he converted us norwegians and saved our souls from the eternal fire
Surprisingly how little controversial he is tbh, lol, he also killed a bunch of russians and thus had to flee from thus exile in Russia if I remember correctly
We sure showed Karl XII
It stings that he gave Norwegian territories like Jemtland and Herjedalen to the Swedes
Just part and parcel of being in an unequal union, I suppose
Were you thinking he wasa hero or villain in Norway
I don't think he's talked too much about these days
Maybe in the past, but as Norwegians we call the union with Denmark Firehundreårsnatten ("The Four Hundred Year's Night"), so we might not single out just one Danish king
I think Norwegians can see that he did both good and bad things looking back, so maybe he's not seen as either a hero or a villain these days
Not at all worried about it (for Norwegian, but very concerned for Sami languages)
We definitely have no problem speaking English with tourists, but if someone moves to Norway then most Norwegians will expect them to learn the language
English is very practical to use internationally
But I mean, I'm not even worried about losing our dialects, so I'm definitely not worried that Norwegian itself will disappear
Norwegian here
I care extremely little about Norwegian and would not care at all if it got replaced by an English-like hybrid or "pure" English
I think the reason for my lack of care for Norwegian is that I use English as my work language
Everything I write, e-mails, reports, and so on is in English and every technical term I use are English
Most of the technical terms I use don't even have Norwegian counterparts
Measly 10% of the media I consume is in Norwegian, and most of those 10% are newspapers
Don't watch Norwegian TV, barley watch Norwegian movies, but I do watch the big "noteworthy" ones
Only thing other I can think of than vikings would be a "budeie" maybe
Typical job for females at the barn, making cows, taking care of the animals and stuff
And I guess sailors are, or rather were, a huge work market when my grandparents were young at least
My granddad was a whaler and so were several of his brothers and friends (cute story: he did quit after my mum was born, because he couldn't bear being away from her
He had one sailing trip when she was just a few months old, came back after she turned one and he swore never again, and then became a prison guard instead)
The trappers who wintered around the Greenland and Barents seas (most in Northeastern Greenland and Svalbard) in order to catch animals for their fur are probably the closest equivalent to the rugged cowboy archetype
The dangers they faced were mostly from the harsh climate and the occasional polar bear
They rarely feature in fiction, but non-fiction books about them and intrepid polar researchers tend to sell well
In Norway it would not be the lumberjacks, but "fløterne" that was the cowboys
Fløterne was the guys transporting the timber downstream rivers, an extremely dangerous profession
Here are some from the 1950ies
First time I hear of this
Although we have a Norwegian word: "rakker", lovingly used about a mischievous child
"Du din lille rakker/rakker-unge
Rakkere was often the assistants of the executioner, and had to clean up the execution place and take away the body
The executioners were low rank in the society and rakkere was even lower
I took a Norwegian Language History class and learned this is exactly where "rakker" comes from
A "rakkerunge" was something you definitely didn't want to be, because then your parents handled corpses and shit and nobody wanted to touch you
It was pretty much the lowest of the low of social classes
So like the untouchables in India
Interesting
13th century during reign of Håkon Håkonsson
Maybe 9th-10th centuries to experience the unification of Norway
1969 when Norway found oil and the cold war was in full swing
Pretty exciting
I wish i grew up in the 60s
I didn't like that summer because i don't have an AC
My house gets to hot and open windows didn't help
About all I know is that there's been a surge of right-wing populist, reactionary, xenophobic, homophobic etc
nutjobs in Poland - as well as other places
In fact I don't think anyone's been completely spared
It's a very worrying trend
I don't think anybody was suggesting the migrants themselves are at fault - except for the ultra xenophobes, of course
Well, no
But «Olsenbanden» had many funny translation jokes, like the time they translated the names George, Robert and James into Georg, Rolf og James (norwegian pronounciation)
And I also know about a TV—reporter in the 1950s that would often invite foreign guests and speak to them in english
Nowadays, when every norwegian know close to fluent english, it becomes pretty funny
His pronounciation was shit and he mostly translated wrong, like confusing a bathrub with a frigerator and when he responded to his foreign guests they would often look confused
Lol, the good old days when you could just pretend speaking english and nobody noticed ...
And I can't not mention «It's not the fart that kills, it's the smell» by Petter Solberg, a rally driver
Fart in norwegian=speed, smell=coalition/hit
So he ment to say «it's not the speed that kills you, it's the hit» but his englishskills are by far more known then his abilities to drive fast, lol
But is that used for any geographical places
I know there are places with ''á'', ''å'', ''â'' and ''č''.
We got 7
The northernmost is in Trondheim, as such, the closest IKEA to me (living in northern Norway) is in Haparanda in Sweden
Funny thing is, if they do decide to build an Ikea in northen Norway (which they have tought about), they want it in Tromsø, so
still the closest IKEA will be on the Sweden/Finnish border
idiotic
I think there is a bunch of them, but i have only seen two or three
Thought there would be more stores
You have one
In the country
The distances and time it takes to drive are laughably short in vestland
or the whole of southern norway for that matter
Since the IKEA's are placed smart in that part of our country
Tromsø-haparanda or bodø-haparanda is about 8 hours driving one way
Bodø-trondheim is about 12, you can do it in 10 if you push it
Shipping is so expensive it sometimes costs more than what you buy there
One strategically placed IKEA in Ofoten area can serve northern norway, aswell as some parts of (sparsely populated) sweden, cutting down travel time considerably for most of northern norway apart from Finnmark
Oslo has 2
There's one near Hamar, a couple of hours north of Oslo
The rest are near Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger and Kristiansand (the second to fifth largest cities)
> There have been several occasions where I was just waiting for a friend somewhere in town standing against a wall for perhaps 10-20 minutes and I was approached by some white people asking me if I sell drugs
Wtf
It's sad that it is this way, but If the Netherlands is anything like Norway, I can see why it happens
A lot of the street level pushers in Norway are African and lots of times they're, well, standing against walls
I’ve heard people say stuff like that on a few occasions
I remember one conversation I had:
Friend: «I just met this African American guy who blablabla».
Me: «Where in the US is he from
Friend: «What
No I think he was born in Senegal
Me: «Oh
But he’s lived in the US
Friend: «What
Why are you bringing up the US
Me:
A family friend said this (in a friendly manner) to my gf a little while back
“Well you must be used to the sun huh”. Like wtf
The person fully who said it fully well knows she was born and raised here, so out of all the little things we’ve experienced in our biracial relationship this wasn’t the worst, but it’s definitely the thing that confused me the most
I completely agree with you, and I'm not in any way trying to excuse their behavior, I just wanted to chime in with the reasoning as to *why* I think that happens
I do however think it's more ignorant than it is racist
I'm Sami myself and I've had my fair share of people making assumptions about me based on that fact alone, but most of the time, it's simply because they've never had an experience with anyone of Sami origin before, and assuming that they're racist just because they might have bought into a perceived stereotype, I don't think is constructive
Racism has become this sort of catch-all accusation, even towards people with no malicious intent and I really don't think it's healthy for the public discourse and social progress in general, especially since racism, for most people, is perceived as an act of active hatred against another race and *not* as ignorance and being accused of it for seemingly no reason just dissuade people from having a conversation about race all together
I don't condone stereotyping based on ethnicity, but I feel the need to say something when people throw the word "racist" around to casually
Assuming you are a drug dealer because you lean up against a wall and have roots from Africa is stupid, stereotypical and careless
It is however, in no form or way racist
Do white people in the western world have an easier time, I'm sure we do
Is it fair
Not at all, and most of us do not think that way
A bad apple spoils the bunch, and you've felt it personally
That sucks, but like you said, not all old white men are pedophiles
Therefore I can't apologize for them, but I can tell you that they are idiots and you should never feel like a victim of their shitty behavior
Rise above it, and show them how small they are
Don't let anyone make you a victim
And that makes me sad, truly, and motivates to work against it even more
Best of luck to you, and have a grear weekend
I do not think there has ever been a debate if Norway is not a part of Northern Europe or Scandinavia
There might be debate wether we are in western europe or not
I like your reasoning
As a western, northern, and absolutely Scanidnavian Norwegian, we are still refering to you based on the once important iron curtain
We'll label each of the following countries _eastern_ Europe: Bulgaria, Albania, Balkans (I know it's not one country
), Romania, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia and Poland (yup)
Russia and its former Soviet Union states like the Baltics, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine are the eastest you can imagine
Example: Headlines in our newspapers will still label criminals from all the countries mentioned above as _eastern europeans_.
Denmark cannot into Scandinavia
A stupid debate, but a debate nevertheless
For an outsider remembering the cold war like it was yesterday, it's easy to lump you guys into the "east" (Back in the day we only had east and west
This was before sliced bread, mind you)
If it wasn't for your (and CZs) languague, I can definitely understand why you would claim central Europe though
Edit: And as soon as this corona thing is fucking done with, Slovenia will be the first country I'll visit
The term east and west europe is from the cold war, when europe was divided into soviet or american spheres of influence
The baltics, and hungary, are in eastern europe
Your feelings about that changes nothing
I dont understand how that will change
Do you have a project for rewriting history or changing the past somehow
East or west europe has nothing to do with the situation, cultural or economical, in any country, its about wich sphere they used to belong to
> yes, and it's getting less and less accurate and getting outdated
FFS you have a dictator running your country
You have _never been more east_ than you are now
(And I'm saying "east" as in cold war east)
Interesting and educational
And natural, if you think about it
But I wonder, do Slovenes speak German (or Italian) like for instance us Scandinavians speak English
Yeah the Baltic-Scandinavian closeness is pretty one directional
I have never ever heard any Scandinavian saying anything about that
Like the last 100 times this was asked, yes
Yes
Kind of rude not to
(Why would you make someone else's floor dirty when it's so easily avoidable
Yes abseloutley
I can't imagine wearing shoes inside my home
Yes, because I'm not a savage
If I lived in a cave, I'd wear shoes
I live in a house, so naturally I take off my shoes
Do people clean their floors every day
>  Why would one want to track all the dirt from outside into the house
That is exactly how I would translate it directly from Norwegian
"Track" = "tråkke" :)
Would be kind of weird sitting around in your rain boots watching TV
Do walk around inside with your rain boots on
Or watch TV in your winter boots
(Or do you have designated indoor shoes on wet / cold days
Made me laugh
Thanks
I know
Sweaty indoor feet
Lovely
> So do you just walk around in your bedroom with outdoor shoes and sit at your desk and cook and everything in outdoor shoes
I just find that so incredibly hard to imagine ':D
Like when it rains - do they walk around inside with their rain boots on
Or watch TV in their winter boots
Ah I see
We usually clean floors only once a week
Exception; kitchen floor
(We have children)
I know
I was talking about Norwegian
> Most just wear their normal shoes
I live in Norway
Wellingtons **are** our normal shoes
Well, at least certain times of the year
I estimate that my children wear Wellingtons to school 90% of the time between October and April
Why not just walking on your socks
> Because you actually leave footprints if you're barefoot, even with socks
But luckily they wont leave any mud behind
> the floors will be ceramic tiles, which can get cold unless you have radiating floor
That is a good point
Tiles can feel like ice
I think the more north in Europe you get, the more rain and mud there is
In a warm and dry climate I guess it makes less sense to take the shoes off (if you don't mind warm feet)
Everything is expensive
"Poor" people eat instant ramen, rice, pork chops and store brand pasta
Tourist eat whale, raindeer, bacalao and pinnekjøtt which is expensive and is usually enjoyed by locals on special occasions
Earlier,  tourist used to think smoked salmon was exciting, bot not any more
I'd be morbidly obese if I lived in a place where I could get currywurst "just anywhere" on the streets
> Yet you see the Swedish meatballs, brown sauce, mashed potatoes and lingonberries for €50 in restaurants
WTF, where
If in Stockholm, let me know where
I have to go there on business in a few weeks
I need to check it out for a good laugh
Red sausages maybe
What's your national dish
> I honestly have absolutely no idea what tourists eat in Denmark
Overpriced smørrebrød. Was just in Denmark, so I know
What do students (living on their own) eat over there
Frikadeller
> Stroopwaffel
I have actually tasted some
You are supposed to put them over coffee
What do they make it from
Unicorn meat
I love smørrebrød. I avoid the tourist spots though
Oh I see
[This one in Bergen is pretty cozy]
We used to have [this McDonald's] in my town, but it closed a few years ago
There is a bakery in that building now that also sells pizzas in the evenings
Funny thing is, the building is one of the few older buildings in the downtown area left standing
Most of the buildings around it are from the 1970s or later
McDonalds in Kristiansand has a quite nice entrance aswell
You can even eat in the bank's vault
"Her kommer vinteren, her kommer den kalde fine tida" (Here comes the winter, here comes the cold and good times)
Norwegians and the winter has a special relationship
There are covers of that song in every genre and the songmaker has a almost national hero status (Jokke from Jokke & valentinerne)
E6 by DDE, a song about the road that goes through most of the country
Norway
"Dovregubbens Hall"
Literally one of the best songs ever
Correct answer would be "Waltzin' Mathilda", no
Yes, quite normal but also unusual
It would be seen as something exotic, but not wrong in any way
Not very common
Some have them for food, but most just have them as pets
I don't think there's any wild ones here
I never had rabbit, but I know people who hunt and eat it regularly
Deer is fucking delicious, especially reindeer
Duck breast is also absolutely amazing
Yep
We do
Atleast deer, but rabbit too
Not very common, but in my experience eating wild hare isn't frowned upon either
Would like to try hunting and eating some, I've already killed one on accident though
Never heard of anyone eating rabbit or hare here
Not seen it in stores or at restaurants either
I've never heard of someone who ate a rabbit/hare that was bought at a store
Also, I think most people think of them as pets rather than food so if someone did, it would be frowned upon
But I can see people eating it if they hunted it themselves
Maybe rabbit
Idk abiut you man, but finnbiff forever
In fact one of my favourite dishes is sauteèd Reindeer
I have spent many months if not years of my life in south sweden and never have i heard of someone eating rabbit there
Try it
Try dick breast, and try souvas (basically reindeer tacos)
Edit: Just realized I spelled dick breast lol, not gonna remove it
Dad moved for work
....I got married
We were living in Palestine/Israel when we moved to Europe
Iceland and the Faroe Islands
The Faroes are like a Bizarro-World, shrunken-down Iceland (shrunken-down in terms of area and population, and even the people themselves; they're like Icelandic Hobbits)
We share a lot of cultural and linguistic history, but the Faroes are just *so* remote in spite of the continued ties with Denmark
It shows in a lot of their religious and social conservatism, in stark contrast to Iceland's general lack of religiousness and social liberalism
But otherwise, I just feel like I'm in a small town in Iceland
Sweden and Norway
It always freaks me out listening to Dutch, and how there are so many similar words with Scandinavian languages and how I kind of understand what is being said
Yet it sounds completely different
The Netherlands is just Denmark with some added bricks in the streets and parking lots
I've lived in Denmark and Germany but didn't spend any longer than a weekend in the Netherlands until just a few years ago
I really don't know what I was expecting, but I was blown away by how familiar it felt
Of course none of that should have come as any surprise
It even became frustrating after a while because I felt like I could respond to people when they addressed me in Dutch; I'm fluent in German/Danish/Norwegian/English, so Dutch isn't much of a leap and I can understand a lot of what I hear, but then when I'd go to answer I didn't have the words because *I don't speak the language*
You say that now and then one day you want a bottle of wine so you go to the local shop and they don't sell any because that would be illegal
So you go to the government ran wine monopoly instead but they're closed because tomorrow is pentacost
i read a study yesterday claiming that deep down all scandinavians really resent each other after centuries of war
Nonsense
We're different peoples with different cultures
hope there is a phase 4 too, we don't want to be left out
Who in their right mind would want wine when you could have all the [karsk] you want
That's a fair point
The same case goes for Iceland re: church membership
You're born into it, few people regularly attend, but unless you make a point to un-register, you're still counted among the country's Lutheran population
Could it also be the case that in the Faroes, the conservative religious population is just more vocal than the rest, and that gets amplified by the small population
Re: conservatism, I speak from the Icelandic perspective, which skews very liberal even by Nordic standards
I've only visited the Faroes a few times so I don't have a any real insider insight, but from the impression I get it's about the same as some small rural towns in the Norwegian Bible-belt
And in your defense, I've never personally encountered any of the notorious Faroese homophobia, and I'm a gay guy
(Not that you read it that way, but just to be clear I've never had anything but positive experience in the Faroes and with Faroese people, so I hope I didn't come off as harsh or snobby
[This video] always cracks me up, it's a Norwegian guy speaking pretend-Dutch to Dutch women on a speed date
The second hand embarrassment is real though
I’d agree
Hehe jeg er egentlig enig med deg
Heldigvis er det hovedsaklig en trøndersk ting, og jeg bor på Østlandet
Skiten er jo nesten like ille som ananas på pizza
Ditto
Enig
The Danish dialect is incomprehensible and Sweden is full of Swedes
As others have mentioned, making friends can be difficult, the few "tricks" i know involve:
Getting drunk at bars, listen around and you might be able to join some conversation and get to know a new group of people
If you enjoy football you can also try "fotballpub", basicly a bar that regularly shows matches, they can be nice communities unless it only consists of drunks over 50
University - Students have tons of activities and clubs to join (I live in a university town, and there are tons of groups to join, like climbing, kayaking, skiing, snowboarding, even sky-diving and para-gliding
Alternative-culture - Might be a tricky one, i know the skateboard culture is quite active, there is also somewhat of an underground rave scene that announces parties through closed facebook groups
Might meet some that can get you in at night-clubs
Make no mistake, there are "drug fiends" in this community but also sober people who just like to dance and have a good time
&#x200B;
It is true that a lot of Norwegian conversation is light, never bringing up what really bothers you in life or bother people with your problems
If any, its said in sarcasticly self-loathing style and laughed off
But it depends, I work in stage/concerts, and it consists of a weird bunch of people, borderline alcoholics, family dads, autistic nerds, druggies and so on
I was almost a bit flabbergasted when after a big breakup i had with my girlfriend of 10 years a colleague took me aside and asked if i ever wanted to talk, to just ask, and he was adamant that he wasn't just paying lip service, he wanted to help
So we Scandinavians can be human on the inside, we just have a hard exterior and it might take some time to get to that level
&#x200B;
For a small comparison, Swedes are seen as quite outgoing to Norwegians, there is the idea of the "party svenske", who is very happy and outgoing
The swedes I've met in my town are very friendly and we always get along
There are several of them here for work, so they're not uncommon
I've never socialized with Danes my own age, so I have no input on them
Rural, it’s often not happening much outside of the major cities, socialising can be difficult when you don’t have the right venues and places to meet others, people tend to live pretty isolated
This can of course variate and be different for different people in terms of interests
There’s often sparsely with shops, cultural venues and cafes/restaurants/pubs etc
Smaller towns are often destroyed by malls within or outside of them, filled with the same boring shops with the same boring stuff
Shops in general in Norway is filled with the same things, the same supermarket chains rule the country, there’s no variation in what is sold
Don’t expect to find your Appenzeller, Gruyere or Pecorino there
Car reliance is a thing
You often have to know someone through work or school to connect with anyone, that’s how your social circle starts up here
Starting a conversation or approaching someone just out of nowhere is often a big no-no
Being different can be a challenge, hence Janteloven
Don’t presume to get any creds for your education or achievements, jealousy is often triggered and people are not interested in such things in the outback (winter tires and fuel prices is more their cup of tea)
Wishing for more, something better, something different is often prohibited
You’ll just sound negative and be isolated
The oil made Norway pretty lazy, making something else like local handcrafts is not encouraged, craftsmanship is much extinct
Made in Norway does not exist
Don’t have any ideas, if you do and decide to open anything up you might be bankrupt the first month anyway
Don’t have different political ideas, like being pro EU in Norway, the majority has decided that we’re staying out because the EU is evil, you’re not allowed to talk about it
*This comment is a bit sarcastic, blown up and harsh, but also true*
Today in Norway there are more males than females among the younger generations
If you want a Norwegian girlfriend the competition is hard
(Actually all over the world, but some countries are more skewed than others)
Among the people who are around thirty years old the percentage of immigrants is around 30%. It is positive if you want to hang out with immigrants, but negative if you want to learn Norwegian or make Norwegian friends
Also negative if you want a more well paid white collar job
The competition is tough, and harder for immigrants
We don't take properly care of our language, but let universities use English and don't teach immigrants our language or demand that they learn it properly
Next generation is going to speak a very simplified Norwegian
All the advanced words, wordplays with proverbs etc are going to die out
It get worse when you know that the Danes are often considered the most outgoing of us
After I moved to Hungary I've realized that I actually think the weather plays a major role
People go out and meet up more often if it doesn't suck going out, and the culture of going out to eat with friends is muuuch rarer in Norway, which is understandable considering you'd go broke if you try to do it regularly, but this is definitely one of the things I am most jealous about with southern Europe
If spoken slowly, danish is intellible thoe
Quite possible, we did have almost two hours of continual sun yesterday
Ka-me-lå-så.
Did you ever read on one of the incel subs
Or you can read a bit about what happens when there is a gender imbalance, for example violence against women increase with a higher male to female ratio (but obviously not right away)
Or you can read anthropology, about why men go to war in smaller societies
Of course it is a competition, the same way that women compete to get the "best man". It is both a competition but also, of course, a quest to find someone you have things in common with etc
But how to find that person when someone else already picked her up
Nynorsk is dying even faster, I think
Many immigrants don't learn it at school
My friend from Somalia, who lived here now for 26 years, just says she thinks it is pointless to learn it
She still makes so many mistakes when she speaks, because nobody told her
Ja, hva i helvete sa du om oss
Efterlignings-spagetti
Yes, but the wars the last centuries + of course the risky life of premature babies meant that more women grew up
There hasn't been the same amount of single young men compared to single young women
Even when you find a girlfriend within your social circles etc, there will be more men who can't find any
Because there are more young men than young women
And I don't know why you are so certain that I am a young man myself
You can probably find some old books, but also my daughter's education in nynorsk was atrocious
They read so very little nynorsk, also
you need exposure to get used to the flow of the language
In many ways nynorsk is prettier than bokmål, because it is more verbal and less substantives
Maybe the reason why they have more poets pr speaker
(It seems so, anyway
[Here] are a few books from antikvariat
net
They are meant for people who already know bokmål, though
It's nice to know that when we have a national emergency and the apocalypse is knocking on the door, the Danes and your butter got out backs
Teifl, my new favorite word
It's quite common to speak sami in inner Finnmark, I'm sami but grew up in an area of Finnmark with more norwegian speakers, so I'm not that good at speaking it myself but I can understand it just fine
Overall though, it's a very miniscule amount of the country who speak it, less than a percent of the population
It would be very sad if it dies out
I hope Finnmark is able to keep it alive
This was really interesting to read
Thank you for this nugget of historical insight
Where in Norway
There are quite a lot of good ethnic restaurants in Oslo if you know where to go
From Torbjørn Egner's "Folk og røvere i Kardemomme by" (When the Robbers Came to Cardamom Town), the song of the police chief:
"Man skal ikke plage andre (You shouldn't bother/pester others)
man skal være grei og snill (you should be nice and kind)
og forøvrig kan man gjøre hva man vil
" (otherwise you can do as you please)
We have so a lot of these sayings
And i feel like it's often from poetry
An example is "Du skal ikke tåle så inderlig vel den urett som ikke rammer deg selv" wich transelates to "you should not endure/tolerate the injustice/suffering that does not affect your self
You think we'll beat Serbia
That's kind of you
Whoever makes it, send us a postcard
Why do you think Scotland wouldn't be able to support an independent economy
Bankrupt - just like Norway you mean
That everyone has to be happy and sporty and positive all the time
Sometimes I'm annoyed, sometimes I'm bored, sometimes I think whatever we're supposed to do (at work or wherever) is stupid as shit
Negative reactions are 1
necessary in order to identify negative things, and 2
part of a healthy emotional spectrum
(Norway) People sitting next to you on the bus

So much
I was just on erasmus and we have an italian friend who would be consistantly 1 hour late
His excuse was always that he had to eat dinner
Mm-MM, that's good trichinosi-AAAARGGHH
Good to know
I'd still treat the whole Mett thing with a little bit of skepticism, myself, though
My first reaction to your question was "what the fuck" so I guess no :p
My first reaction to your question was "what the fuck" so I guess no :p
You don't even need the American flag flair with this post
During the middle ages, there wasn't really a permanent capital
It changed depending on where the monarch decided to live, but in 1314 the king decreed that the bishop in Oslo would be the nation's chancellor for the rest of time, so that's when it became the permanent capital
In 1537 Copenhagen became the official capital of both Denmark and Norway, which lasted until 1814 when the union was dissolved after Napoleon's loss, and Oslo (Christiania at the time) was made capital again
Norwegian: "Det gir jeg en god faen i"
Literally: "I give a good damn about it"
We can also say "Jeg bryr meg ikke" (I don't care)
But we don't have any of the Swedish short versions (to my knowledge)
But I would normally say: "Det bryr meg midt på leggen
" Meaning "I only care up to the middle of (my) calf". And since that is pretty far down on my body it show just how little I care
There's probably other expressions too but I am having a slow day here
Det bryr meg midt i ræva = that worries me right in the arse
If you were missing something about the nether regions I mean
The Iraqi geologist [Farouk al-Kasim] discovered and helped us secure our oil reserves
And politician Carl I. Hagen wanted us to sell the rights to drill for oil to the Americans
Imagine how different everything would be
I shudder at the thought
Carl I. Hagen was the leader of our populist right leaning political party, some of us love to remind people that a foreigner secured our oil and he almost screwed over the whole country
We have Russ (search it up)
We have allemannsretten, which means you can camp into the wild for like 3 days
We have a female primeminister, the fatest in Europe
Norway exists
Norway has two official and hundreds of unofficial written forms of norwegian, Bokmål and Nynorsk
There only live 5 million in Norway
Norway is in NATO and not in the EU
Norway is handing out the nobel peace prize
Yet Norway is one of world's greatest exporteurs of weapobs of massdestruction, we sold uranium to both Israel and Iran, and are selling a ton of weapons to Saudi Arabia fighting in Yemen
Norway has some disgusting food, just like Iceland and Sweden
Norway is one of the largest countries in the world, if seawater is accounted for
Continental Norway controlls Jan Mayen, Svalbard and Bjørnøya in the arctics
As well as Peter Is island, Bouvetøya and Dronning Maud land in Antarctica
Svalbard in Norway holds the world's seed bank, with samples of all millions of plants from across the world
Svalbard is also basically only under norwegian protection, which means that foreigners easily can get acces to the island and live there
A case was a lithuanian fishing crew fishing an endangered specy outside the island thoe, I think they lost their fishing certificate but due to EU regulations we couldn't give them tickets to pay for their «crimes against enviromental protection». A bunch of islands also got special right in 1920 on the islandgroup, but only Russia still holds these
Thus Russia has a town on Svalbard, Barentsburg which looks like an old soviet town, and they are mining coal there as well
Ahh, Kalle Anka
You have «Pippi Långstrømp» as well
Yeah, my german teacher's father was born in Breslau
My great great grandma on ''the wrong side'' of Oder
Has Carl I. Hagen ever done anything positive for the country
I'm genuinely curious about what he has achieved
I know FRP has voted for paying 100 billion NOK on removing the toll stations based on Carl's proposal
The money they want to use on that is going to be taken straight from the oil fund

by Erlend Loe
Anything by Erlend Loe if you like weird humor
Like the book about the guy who's had enough of being a decent citizen and sets up a tent to live off the land in the forest on the outskirts of Oslo (Doppler)
If you like classics, I suggest Mysteries by Knut Hamsun
>Isn't Jo Nesbø popular everywhere
It's popular many places in Europe, but I personally don't know any Americans who had heard of his books, I never even saw his books in bookshops in the US
We lost our formal 'you ("De") in the 60's... Since then we haven't been particularly formal up here
I would have no problem (at all) using our prime minister's first name while talking to her for instance
And calling someone Mr or Ms/mrs is completely out of the question
Neither do we normally say Doctor so and so or Lawyer so and so - unless pointing out their profession is important for understanding what I'm trying to say
> but mate you were holding me while I was puking in the gutter last night, you can stop talking to me like I'm some royalty now
I remember there being some kind of expression for being on a "tu" basis (tutoyer or something like that)
Way back when I knew French
But yeah, that situation would make royalty have a "tu" relationship with you
> In Spain, students of all ages call their teachers by their first names, and using tú - never usted or anything formal
> Outside Spain, this is considered very weird
Here teachers tend to be closer to the students, you can joke with them as long as you remember they are the authority
Spain, you can into Scandinavia
[No, it's terrible here]
About when does that change usually happen in Germany
How do you pronounce it
I have Polish neighbours living in the flats above us
Would be nice to randomly say that to them when they pass by
Yeah, this is normal in Norway
Certain girl names often has an -is suffix with younger people:
Ingeborg = Ingis,
Sunniva = Sunnis,
Stine = Stinis
People tend to grow out of those nicknames when they get older, though
At least in my experience
Whaaaat, I've never heard that, except with Nathaniel -> Nathis
To be fair, nicknames weren't very common where I lived
The ones who did have them mostly ended with -e, like Sebastian -> Sebbe, or just with whichever letter made sense with the rest of the name
Most names were just shortened, like Theodor -> Theo and Alexander -> Alex
Yeah, same here
I feel Norway in general isn’t big on nicknames
In my area the only consistent trend was the -is on certain girl names, though we do have our Bens and Theos, too
My name is quite long with 4 syllables so it was always shortened by simply chopping it in half, same with some of my other friends
But most people had 3-5 letter names, and there is no point in shortening those
So I guess that contributes to it
In my area we don’t use nicknames, but if the person have a special last name we just call them that
I have a lot of friends that is wierd calling Kristoffer or Magnus because we call the by their last name
Yeah, that’s a good point
> What is it like growing up in Georgia
I actually don't have a clue
Sorry Georgia that I know so little about you
Neither exists
Small audience I guess

Being poor in our part of the world means you cannot afford out of school activities (if you are a child)
Or that you own only one winter jacket
Or that you travel by bus instead of owning a car
Or you spend the summer at the beach instead of travelling to Thailand or Hawaii
It never means having to live in the car with the rest of your family
Or not being able to afford going to the doctor
Or not being able to buy life saving medication
Or not being able to go to the university
Or not receiving any care when you get old and sick

Insane
This was something I noticed with Poland, a lot of people had billboards in their backyard
I don't know if I've ever seen that here in Norway
Everything is so pretty now
If Norway stopped other countries like Russia and Saudi-Arabia would only increase production to stabilize oil supply and demand to retain prices
But yes, I agree
It would be for the best if everyone would agree to gradually stop oil drilling
That's so dramatic lol

I'll probably just be downvoted, but this is a caricature printed in the conservative and nationalist Iranian newspaper Vatan-e-Emrooz who is aligned with and owned by fundamentalist political parties
It's not "Irans depiciton" any more than Fox News speaks for USA or The Sun speaks on behalf of the UK though
I kinda like the style of this
I should find out who the artist is and commission a painting of the prophet Muhammad
They believe he is a Vulcan
I don’t get what the Iranians have against tieflings
Irans official depiction or newspaper
That distinction matters a lot here
This drawing looks pretty good not gonna lie
Do Iranian moderates really disagree with the sentiment though
Saffron
Well, i believe there are two sides to this story, the depiction of muhammed, and regional battles for political influence in the ME
To begin with, to understand why attacks like this, Charlie Hebdo etc happen, is because in Sunni islam, its a major sacrilege to depict muhammed in any form
It doesn't matter if its a caricature or an attempt at flattery, its still some of the worst blasphemy you can do
In Shia islam, like in Iran, this isn't nearly as touchy a subject
People are allowed to paint muhammed, depict muhammed on TV etc
It's not really a huge deal
Which brings us to the political battles for influence
As in most parts of the world, the "large players" are trying to win influence in their neigboring countries
As almost the only Shia majority country in the region, Iranian politicians thus often support sunni muslims in other countries in these cases, to not look weak and lose support
So TL:DR, do moderate Iranians really care
I don't think many do
Hardliners will use any situation that can create animosity towards the west to political gain, including this one
Of course this is just my analysis of the situation
It's quite complicated
It be like that tho
make bosnia, kosovo and albania no data, and maybe put crimea back in and then you got it pretty much right
Greece good
I'm sorry my brothers, but they are never doing good

How many damn times will this fact be reposted
Always interesting reading threads on reddit about Norway, because any positive news whatsoever is always instantly brushed off because Norway produces oil so obviously everything they do is evil and news like this doesn't matter
Half the comments in this thread have nothing to add other than "whatever, doesn't count, they still produce oil".  Hot takes right there, fellas
Like, what is it that you expect
Norway produces oil so they should just lean into it and be a record-breaking global polluter
As long as some of the industry is dirty then any green policies are apparently pointless
Now I just have to wait 7-8 years to get a cheap 2020 second hand electrical car
Fuck Musk
This is so last year news
How many time is it gonna get posted
Every time it's posted, there's these same comments
Oil, subsidies, hypocrites, oil, bla bla
We spent a lot, or rather lost a lot of govt income through taxes and fees that fossil cars are subject to
Denmark had a similar scheme, which they abolished
Over night, [EV car sales plummeted
Ehh
There is no marked for second-hand electric cars since it's too expensive to repair them
You don't get any subsidies on replacement parts or work
That means it's cheaper to buy a new car than replacing as example the battery in the old one
In short electric cars are use-and-throw away just like regular batteries and other short lived electrical equipment
Just dump it in a fjord and buy a new one
It's much cheaper than trying to find that one battery connector that's corroded from all the salt we use on the winter roads
In Norway there are luckily charging stations on every petrol station and parking garages
Seen this a bit too much lately
I don't remember who it was, but someone once commented that Norway is like the dealer who doesn't touch his own goods
Over 95% of the energy we use ourselves comes from hydro
So we can pat ourselves on the back and pretend like our emissions aren't high because exported energy doesn't count as energy used in the country of origin
Oh the obligatory "they export oil, so they cant be green" comment
Do you always bring up bad news on posts that mention good news from a country
At least we didn't eff up like Canada did with their oil
Then transition offshore petroleum industry over to massive offshore sea wind so Europe can charge their coming Evs fleets on green energy exports
>And they pay for these subsidies
Uh, they don't. Norway just *doesn't tax it
Ye, thanks for buying our oil
It is possible to rent ICE cars (or swap with a friend) for the times you actually need it instead of letting the occasional long distance trip dictate your daily driving
They are hard to repair because they are new -- this is not really specific to electrics
What is specific to electrics is that repairs and spare parts are taxed higher than new vehicles, making repairs artificially more expensive
Couple that with arbitrary rules from insurance companies stating that if the repair costs more than ~60% of a new vehicle, it must be scrapped, no matter the risk of the repair -- e.g. if one expensive but easy to replace part is broken (an example was given in the article that you cite), and everything is fine, the car will be scrapped (no matter the type of motor)
U jelly
>  exported energy doesn't count as energy used in the country of origin
yes, who has to carry the burden, the heroin user or the afghan farmer ?
Also, the Kyoto Protocol agreed to the emissions should be calculated this way
The burden should fall on the end user and not the producer
Small economies with big coal export should not be affected by the emissions when they are not the end user
That would be green washing rich countries that use coal for heat and electric production
Like this if a country with 200 000 inhabitants exported coal to Germany and then get the CO2 emissons from both producing the coal and the burning of coal in Germany
Would that be considered "fair" ?
No no no, it can't be equated to a direct cost
Simply because if the tax exemption wasn't there then a lot of people would buy a less expensive car or not buy a car at all
Which is why we should invest more in green technologies to find solutions that can help the world as a whole use less oil, instead of finding new places to pump it up
Not saying that it should necessarily count as an emission here, but that Norway and other countries with a lot of oil and gass export should take some responsibility
For example not opening up for oil searching close to the Arctic circle
But instead using more money on developing green tech that can take over for oil in the future
The world doesn't run on doritos
The world still ***NEEDS*** oil
What is your plan then, besides being smug about it
Norway is using its wealth responsibly and investing in green tech thst will help end fossil fuel dependence
What are most other oil producers doing
Correct
Nah, we handled it very well
By looking at some countries you can see how it can be a blessing or a curse
But again, how come pretty much all "frozen irrelevant countries" is richer than Portugal
Not everyone has oil, but they are still better off
Well, technically you can't because then you would have to export the car from Norway, and pay VAT in the country of import
We're still talking about expanding oil searching to the arctic though (the government is, anyway)
Yes, we are investing in green tech, but we should be doing *more* of that, instead of going "oooh let's see if there's oil in a place with a vulnerable eco system so far from any land that stopping an oil spill that could spread around the globe will be impossible, yay"
Indeed - it would be cheaper if it is older tough
When we imported our ancient (non-electric) car from France to Norway, we had to document it's value (about 4k euros IIRC) and VAT was added on top of that
And I guess it should also have been possible to get back some of the VAT from France
I think everyone fully agrees that bikes are more environmentally friendly than EVs, however that's not really the same discussion as piston-power VS electric power
Regenerative breaking, the engine brakes and thus recharges the battery
I doubt your diesel BMW gets 1100 km of range on the Autobahn
Ye, so what about countries like Sweden
They are frozen and dont have oil or a so called "golden egg". Still better off than Portugal
How is that
I'm not sure how it works, but as you export something from country A I'd hope you can have back the VAT on the current value of the item
High tech solution

To add to what you said: Growing up in a small town in Norway, I remember a few individuals I went to school with that expressed blatant racism, and some even became neo-Nazis
What they all had in common was that none of them achieved well in school, sports, or in social relations
They were the kids that the other kids made fun of
I get that my own experience is a particular case, and not universally applicable
However, it is important
to attempt acknowledge and understand what leads to such radicalization, whether it being neo-nazism, islamism or other, to be able to combat it effectively
It's not in times of prosperity we normally see uprisings of extremists
Hitler was lawfully elected to power by people going through difficult times

Not likely to happen
Politicians like to use climate change as a source for additional income, since it is easier to gain political support for taxes on something that pollutes than for instance income
Then they use that tax income on vote-winners like for instance welfare
It's about carrots and sticks, and politicians prefer to use the stick since it gives them more money to spend, while they still can claim that they are doing something, even though it is not that effective - and more likely to drain people of money than accomplish real change
Trains and railways are en extremely expensive and long term investment
New rails especially high speed, take decades to build after they're planned
On top of that there's a side argument for the destruction of nature and impact (double meaning) on wild life
All in all those shouldn't be an argument as its a net positive, but
I'm surprised it has worsened
What did people believe was different (better) before the pandemic
The source is literally on the image
I talked to a Polish person who had not heard about the riots in the US
This was about a week or two after it all started
Which I found really surprising because it had been front page news in Norway every day since it started
(It was obviously not front page news in Poland
I suspect some people simply weren't aware of some of the problems the US has been facing or at least the scale of those problems, or didn't give them much thought
A crisis often reveals a person's or a nation's true nature, and this crisis has done so more than most
So, for instance, the average European was probably aware that income inequality was an issue in the US, but seeing images of long lines of people waiting for charity from food banks just days after losing their jobs hammered home just how many Americans are living on the brink of economic disaster
Similarly, most Europeans know that American health care is expensive, but the response to the pandemic has revealed both the lack of any central cooperation or planning (there really is no such beast as The American Health Care System) and the emphasis on maximizing profits above all other concerns
And, of course, if you believed the partisan divide in the US wasn't as bad as people claim, it's hard to continue believing that when people argue about basic public health measures as partisan issues
For the record: I grew up in the US and I still have family and friends there
I am deeply worried about the current situation
but not surprised
You are probably right
Personally I am not surprised by any of it, but I have probably looked into things more than the average European
Public health care and all citizens having access to a dignified life (i.e good welfare programs) are close to my heart
And yes
I am worried too
I have both friends and family in the US
Just out of interest I checked where Poland is on the word press freedom index
Poland rank as number 62
For comparison Romania rank as number 42, USA: 45, and there are at least 4 African countries with better ranking compared to Poland

Overcorrection thirty-odd years later
It's only loosely related to what we talked about further up
But could maybe help explain why a more full picture is not seen on their front pages
Well
while the "are democrats left-wing or not" discussion is a whole own thing, the difference is probably more that you can be socially liberal and/or economically liberal
The former is associated with the left (and I suppose libertarianism) because it's in natural opposition with conservatism, the latter with the right because

The "yee haw, them dern librulz" brand of "liberal" is just that the Americans, characteristically, decided to use the term to mean something else than most of the rest of the world

there’s a difference between seperatism and ukraine wanting to remain ukraine and not become a part of russia
>there’s a difference between seperatism and donetsk wanting to remain donetsk and not become a part of ukraine
only 38% of donetsk are ethnic russians
according to surveys only 23% of Donbass (the two seperatist republics) actually want independance or union with russia
the referendums of independance were definetly tampered
donetsk is ukranian, and wants to be, seperatists don’t represent the 100% of the population
>Oh, don't tell me that you are on the Assad side in syrian conflict
This is just another horrible example of what can go wrong when a government responds to separatism movement with oppressive force
The isis raise and feeds on the people anger against the central government
i never said i was, i’m in support of democracy and rule of law, isis is horrible and assad is not any good either
my point is a government has to draw the line of free speech somewhere, you can’t allow everything under freespeech
Imprisoned because of writings, or because they broke the law
he was imprisoned on charges, he was charged with espionage by the US and detained by the UK who have an extrafition bill with the US
it’s definetly not fair and it’s censorship and political injustice
basically there were charges, unfair charges but charges non the less
There was some news a year ago about how a Polish truck driver had been arrested here after driving drunk for nearly 5 miles on the highway before being pulled over
First thing that came to my mind is how this would never happen with a Norwegian truck driver, since they would crash after 500 meters
Why should she be more immune to being peppersprayed than you
Is that fair
So the police is held accountable
Seems like it works fine then
Not here in Norway
Then again, we spend a lot of resources on police training, you have to take a 3 year bachelor's degree to become police, and it's regarded as a job carrying a certain status
If you only recruit dumb and angry people to be police, you get dumb and angry police
Why should the government be able to attack you for standing up to them lawfully

You know, every now and then some Norwegian historians dress up as vikings, make a longship and sails to Lindisfarne
this entertains me
Won't do it again
(We're still proud of it, though, for some reason)
They had it coming, leaving their gold and silver unguarded like that
Do keep in mind that this is basically propaganda
(If the literal dragons weren't a hint)
A bit of both probably
They often formed groups from many different countries when they traveled, picking up crew in lots of places
Lots of triggered danes in the comments here
Danes always take credit whenever historians say "Norwegian or Danish". Same with the origin of Rollo
[Rome was built on rape
It was par on course for how society used to be*, hell pirates are children's entertainment today
You don't think they ever raped
^^^*Maybe ^^^still ^^^is
It could be based on the "newly" found "viking age" that happened 3000 years ago, during the bronze age, where they most likely had helmets with horns
It's mentioned in Norwegian here:
As you can see on these petroglyphs, the men are depicted using helmet with horns:
Heh
Seriously though
They had been trading with the british isles for thousands of years before that according to the physical evidence
Same could be said of Norway
Ottar of Hålogaland, who explored much of the known world in the 9th century, said to Alfred the Great when he visited Wessex that when he sailed from his home in (Lofoten) Hålogaland, down south along the coast until he came to Skiringssal, a trade center in the current Viken county around the Oslofjord, said to the king that the land from all along the coast from the north and to Viken and beyond was "Nordvegr" or the Northern way, and along the fjords and inside the country was where the "Northmen" (Nordmenn) lives
So there was definitely an idea of Norway too
Harald Fairhairs idea to become king of Norway had to come out of somewhere
This was in the late 9th century, so idk how it was in 793, but probably not much different
Yeah, having rape as their genesis story
Surely a good look

I honestly think that the US would be much better if they had one term instead of two
This is no longer the darkest timeline
I'm so hyped for 21st of January when Trump will hopefully be gone from the news cycle
Well, unless he gets banned, which he should have been a long time ago, I bet that he will still tweet
I don't know, I guess I'm gonna miss the madness
You can do the same in any country where enough votes are counted for the loser to be mathematically eliminated
At the very least he has solid competence in running a nation
Trump got just 4 years experience in comparison
Though I agree ivory tower career politicians are problematic, electing someone with zero experience for such a job is in fact the worse decision

You cant really call him democratically elected
Not all the senators were democratically elected, Amidala and Jar Jar for instance, were both appointed by non-democratic leaders, not a democratic vote
And even the ones who were, we know Palatine had corrupted, blackmailed and  manipulated to be loyal to him, not the people
But not all of those senators were democratically elected
Both Jar Jar and Amidala was appointed by leaders who were not themselves democratically elected
Honestly surprised Norway is just 37%. Feels like all we have is forests
This is totally unfair
Everyone knows trees don't grow above the tree line
Can confirm, I grew up in northern Norway and our summer vacations when I was a kid consisted of driving around the northern parts of Sweden and Finland, if I never see a tree again it'll be too soon
The only cool thing I remember was driving through the woods in Finland and then suddenly the two lane road widened to like 12 lanes or something ridiculous like that for a couple of kilometers, I think it was so that they can land airplanes there in times of crisis
Nice map
I'd love to see one but % of man-made object/city coverage
A lot of mountains, and parts of the country are far enough north that trees don't grow properly
Imagine the planet Hoth, but with summer months as well
Much of Norway is like Hoth
Also trees don't grow in the fjords
And if the the bottom of a Norwegian walley is not a fjord, it's a river, then the rest of the flat areas are farmland
Only the sides are forest, go to high and you reach Hoth again

Nå i disse tider med valget og Capitol angrepet, har det dog betydelig blitt mer USA nyheter, men generelt sett har vårt samfunn i Norge drevet lenger vekk fra alt amerikansk de siste 10-15 årene — med unntak fra underholdning

Do you ever go to other posts than the immigration ones
In any other politcal topic the sub is generally on the left
This seems surprisingly difficult to grasp for many people
Then check any other topic than immigration
There are more than a single factor to indicate where someone is on the political axis
Maybe the guy who wants more taxes for the rich, more welfare, less privatization, more nationalization of services, strict immigration, a greener power grid, less authoritarianism and more LGBT friendly policies is not far-right, who knows
Or are we LARPing as Americans again where we pretend there's only two political parties and embrace polarization because it seems to work out so well over there
So, what happens to Mann
So Celtic basically no one properly speaks a Celtic language there but many do in Wales and France(Brittany) lol
Yes either Wales or Brittany(in France) alone has more native speakers of a Celtic language than the two Irelands and Scotland put together
Scotland is about as Celtic as England proper at this point
The Gaelic Republic
i think they look rather nice
Doesn't make sense given how they speak a Celtic language and the Faroe Islands speak a North Germanic language related to Icelandic and Norwegian
If anything, now the Faroe Islands belongs to us again ;)

My grandma had tuberculosis as a kid and was hospitalized for years because of it, so I'm glad we all got the vaccine back then but I'm a little surprised we've stopped by now
It was mandatory up until 1995 for all children to get it, until 2009 it was part of the teen vaccine program, and now it is only mandatory if your parents are from an area with active infections
Apparently there are still about 300 yearly cases of TB in Norway, so it's not completely gone here either
All treatment and vaccines related to the disease is free here because it is considered a hazard to the whole public
So if you have a reason to you can still get the vaccine
I didn't know until I read your comment and looked it up that we have dropped it as part of standard vaccines

I don't think that is how politics work
"Ok, today we are voting for these 2 billion, those who want cancer treatment say aye, those who want television say nay". Every time you delegate money for anything, the opposition will say you take it from the worst possible alternative
Funding the army
Now you take the money from schools
Funding the police
Now it's taking money from hospitals
Funding hostpitals
That's taking money from international relief
How does China fit in there
Yeah but China has some of the smartest leaders, they're entirely different than the US
If you compare it to the [Norwegian parliament] it's not that far off
Comparison to your "parties":
Rødt - Socialism
SV - Socialism
AP (the rose) - Labour
Senterpartiet - Centrism is exciting (or What about the districts
MDG - Thunberg (they will get a lot more seats next election)
KrF - Christians who (mostly) aren't bible-thumpers
Venstre - Liberalism
Høyre - Liberal and conservative at the same time
FrP - Covert racists
This is pretty accurate tbh
i mean, it’s not that wierd
it’s just the US who are very right wing, but has still managed to drive a hard border between two very similar ideologies
SV - Socialistic Left
Venstre - Liberal and conservative at the same time
Høyre - Covert racists
Frp - Overt racists
Edit: People are apparently offended by this comment
The comment I replied to used "Liberalism
" for Venstre, which wasn't one of the options in the OP
I changed it around to only use descriptions from OP
Venstre is IMO best suited for the "liberal and conservative at the same time" moniker
You can fight me on that if you want, but they've really lost their liberalism way in this government
Calling Høyre covert racists is a bit tongue in cheek, but the way they cooperate with the overt racists in Frp (like Listhaug) to have them be the racist face of the government is why I put it there
It's all supposed to be in good fun, right
Feel free to suggest alternate descriptions, but you're not allowed to use "liberal and conservative at the same time" for both Venstre and Høyre
I don't think so
The one above is pretty accurate
I'm sure Americans would classify even the right spectrum of Norwegian politics as socialism
Nah, Høyre is definitely liberal (in the actual meaning of the word) and conservative, and FrP kicked out the overt racists
Demokratene are the overt racists
Edit to your edit: Venstre doesn't really fit with any of the categories, and the same with AP, which is why I didn't use the terms OP supplied for those two
Høyre is definitely not racist
FRP; yeah, they've got a couple of somewhat racist moments
Parties like Alliansen, Demokratene, Selvstendighetspartiet and others on the far, far right though; are definitely overtly racist
For those not familiar with Norwegian politics, it might interest them to know that the Democrats, here described as "overtly racist", has an Iranian-born Kurd as its current party leader
([relevant link]
Yeah, but they're not in Parliament
See my edit for my rationale
How is that relevant
And do you think it's any better to be covert racists than overt racists
While I believe it, Demokratene, Liberalistene, and Alliansen are filled with racists POS
Have you guys had similar new parties pop up the last few years

I greatly enjoy that this is drawn without land/ocean borders, which serves to emphasise just how important coastlines are
Similarily you find that inland, population density tends to follow rivers
For Norway at least I guess it's because it's a big country with a fairly small population and a fair amount of people still live very spread out in small villages and such
Also mountains
That is because the size of your country equals only one of our counties (fylke)
Mountains, islands and fjords
That's Norway

A year of COVID lockdowns has clearly damaged me, because my first thought when seeing this picture was "what kind of video conferencing software are they using".
My second thought was how disappointing it is to see that none of them have a cat filter on
Many comments on this post are so strange
Biden is just making a symbolic gesture to show that he will try to be less of a dick than Trump, they are not trying to crown him emperor of the EU or something that some seem to want to portray it as
Did they not have an adult sized chair for Biden
Might be the only one who cares, but why is the US attending an EU summit
The EU went to war in Iraq
It's just a symbolic gesture

Arnold talked about this in an interview
He got caught trying to sneak back into the base, and the higher-ups were very angrily talking about how they were going to punish him
When the brass realized he'd won the competition they saw the PR opportunity of "glorious Army discipline helps you achieve your goals", so they ended up "punishing" him by putting him on kitchen duty where for the first time in his life he got access to protein every day

They're leaders of the EU and effectively most of Europe
That's a man (Michel) and woman ([**von der Leyen**] respectively
As for Merkel, she's respected by many Europeans, but she's hated by a tiny minority of extremists

It's not meant literally though
Though he would "steal" it away from the people who made it (Germans), and keep it for his own
If it happened early enough, it might have
Was probably too late by the time they had 40% of the vote
Hitler being thrown into prison is a very good example of the state being too lenient with and sympathetic to the Nazis
Hitler spent 9 months in prison for a *coup attempt*, and many of his accomplices weren't punished at all
Versailles *was* set up to fuck over Germany, but I'd ask you to consider how harsh Versailles was when compared to the peace settlement after WW2
There certainly wasn't any Nazi party then (though there were still Nazis who were conveniently ignored everywhere, but that's another matter)
Hell, there wasn't any *Germany* for a few years
I don't really buy the idea that something is inevitable in history
The rise of the Nazis has many reasons, and it could have been stopped
The Nazis might have found some other way into power, but it would have cost them more than it did historically if they weren't handed power by the Conservatives (who foolishly thought they could control Hitler)
The Army, while no progressive force by any means, was not in the pocket of the Nazis until the Nazis were in power
Any new coup attempt would give the Nazis less legitimacy, even if they managed to avoid civil war
Oh no the country we invaded is fighting back, how horrible

Yesterday someone posted on r/norge about being a student stuck in panicking New York not knowing what to do
They seemed genuinely frightened
I think if I was in their shoes it would feel somewhat ensuring to read that post by the NTNU, especially after getting tickets home
I get what you mean though, it seems like an unneccessary low blow to the US healthcare and politics, however I actually think the positives outweight the negatives by writing it like that
What is there to be envious about
The US is very powerful, but what good does that do when the power is not spent improving the lives of its citizens
Sure, but how many students at NTNU is in the US compared to Myanmar, Congo and Sierra Leone
>  If you have good health insurance
Well, that's the problem right there
I agree
You don't really think about something you've taken for granted all your life (free healthcare at home)
It's one thing to have "insurance" in the US and another to actually have *sufficient* insurance coverage and end up at the right hospital (without out of network charges)
You can still end up paying a lot even with insurance
Except it's not even a low blow, it's just
how things are
It's information for people who need to hear it
USA is a pretty bad place to be stuck right now

Oh you don't know Scandinavian car culture
Thing's crazy here, the government is pushing the same kind of BS here and it's resulted in pretty much a straight up war between car enthusiasts and the state
In my town they gather in the thousands up by our local mall to tear up the asphalt every now and then to protest against the new car regulations and the cops who enforce it
As a result, the entire commercial area gets shut down and the entrances get blocked with heavy machinery if the cops hear someone talking about an upcoming "rånetreff" as we call it here
It's mad
Nope Oslo people hate it
Or maybe

It seems as if the events in France these past couple weeks have made peoples opinion of non-western immigrants shift even more towards the right side of politics
I know that people in my friend group here in Norway which is a pretty leftist country have stated concern over their political party's pro-immigration politics
Seems as if these events have been the last drop for a lot of people all over Europe from what I have heard
Pieces of Shit
Fuck them
Ok so it would be really helpful now if muslims collectively stand up against this violence before it escalates further, and help Europe weed out these crazy fuckers
It would be helpful for everyone and would stop legitimizing the far-right
This makes me so sad

West Berlin was an enclave of another country at the time, and the borders definitely weren't open, so what would be the point in adding it on that map
I've seen other maps with similar style, and as far as I can remember, they only show what they're "supposed" to show, so if it's a map of a specific region, you get these borders around the region with everything outside being void

God this joke is stupid
[Just did a couple of side-by-sides] comparing the old and new Oslo
Not exact, as I had to get the modern pictures from Google Streetview
A few thoughts and questions from a 42 year old guy living in Oslo:
- First of all, that is Henrik Ibsen caught in the wild
The only thing more spectacular would be a paparazzi photo of Shakespeare
- Lots of tipping the hat and smiling
I don't want to make this into a m'lady meme, but Oslo could really need some of that type of friendliness back in fashion
- Some of the pictures if not most seam to have been taken on 17th of May
It really looks like people have dressed up for our national holiday
I'm not sure if the pictures represent average people in Oslo during that time or if this is mostly people who have dressed up for this occasion
The flag carrier gives it away
But you can also see people wearing traditional bow, girls in the traditional "bunad" and flags at full mast
It might be another special occasion and the pictures might be from many different days, but my immediate thought was that many if not most of the pictures was from this celebration
- Oslos main/parade street (Karl Johan) has not changed too much since these pictures were taken
The Parliament and the Kings Castle are still the same places, and most of the surroundings buildings look the same
- All the women are using umbrellas to block out the sun
That something you have to travel to Asia to see today
:-D
That's over a hundred years ago, and I still manage to recognise both places and people
That's kinda cool
I believe there is quite a few photos from 17th May celebrations, the Norwegian Constitution Day
In particular [#24,] [#33] and [#53
] There could be more, which would explain some of the nice clothing
But I doubt he had enough film in his camera for it only to be from that celebration
He even managed to take a photo of Henrik Ibsen (the most played playwright in the world after Shakespeare)
Wow, I love this
I just love seeing photos from back then in the 19th century
How life was and how the world was
Much different from now, but humans haven't changed a bit
It's fun to think about
As a Norwegian, seeing Oslo like this was kind of cool
A lot of buildings and roads still look exactly the same today
Also, is that Ibsen at #48
This is so interesting
What strikes me is how new Oslo looks
You can tell it's not like major European capitals like London or Paris back then, everything is very neat and fresh; like it's just being built
Also funny how [this] picture is taken in the exact heart of Oslo, that's the Royal castle in the background, and the spot where the photographer is standing is in the middle of Karl Johan, one of the biggest and busiest streets in the city today
Most of the pictures have either the castle, the university or the parliament in the background, so apart from the ones taken on boats or on what looks like vacations in cabins or something, he took most of them in an area of only a few blocks around where he attended school
This can't be Norway, people are smiling and greeting a stranger
I have some pictures of my great grandpa from back in the early 1900s and people would even wear suits and hats for sports (rifle shooting, ski jumping and cross country)
And this was in rural Norway even
> most of the surroundings buildings look the same
Yes, most of them, but not all of them
Thankfully, the plans to change the area were not implemented (when building the Parliament, new courthouse, etc)
In the 1950s or so they wanted to make it a highway
> Oslos main/parade street (Karl Johan) has not changed too much since these pictures were taken
The Parliament and the Kings Castle are still the same places, and most of the surroundings buildings look the same
Actually it have changed substantially
I would guess that least three quarter of the buildings along the street have either been significantly altered to the unrecognizable or been demolished since these pictures were taken
Even the small part of it shown in these pictures have gotten these new buildings:
- [The Tostrup building]
- [Lille Grensen 7]
- [Grand Hotel]
- [Karl Johans gate 33]
- [Karl Johans gate 45]
It kinda looked like most of the pictures was just him bumming around outside the University, so a lot of them probably were people he knew
It has changed *a little* to be fair
The areas in the photos look pretty much the same today
I live in Oslo
But a novel like "Hunger" would not make much sense today, we are not the poorest country in Europe anymore

Most of the pictures are taken around the university in Oslo, where the photographer was a student, so many of them are probably people he knew

Yes, absolutely, it would be just another "dialect" to us
>  You can tell it's not like major European capitals like London or Paris back then
Eh, have you heard of [Paris and Haussmann] before
Oh, that's my old school
University of Oslo on Karl Johan street in Oslo city center
A lot of the old, beautiful stuff was destroyed here too
It just happens to be that a) These pictures were mostly taken before they were built and b) they were taken at different places to where the destroyed buildings once stood
The area around Karl Johan (which is where these pictures were taken) is well preserved, but it is a different story outside of it
Examples of buildings that have gone lost:
- [Det Engelske Kvarter]
- [Hasselgården]
- [Tollbugata 23]
- [Sjømandshjemmet]
- [Drammensveien 2]
- [The whole Stortorvet building row]
> The first cell phone call was made in 1985
You're off by about 40 years
The first mobile phone is from 1949
The first fully automated system is the Swedish MTA, dated 1956, and the first  multinational mobile network is NMT, which opened in 1981
Ibsen is in one of the photos
He is at least 128 if you do the math

We pretend it never happened
Norway was damaged by WWI
The economy took [a real dip (historical GDP, change in percent)
Food in general was in short supply and got more expensive, as the Germans sunk Norwegian trade ships
Imports were crucial and our merchant fleet was one of the world's largest
The British pressured Norway to became the "neutral ally" and Germany responded in kind
A total of 847 ships were sunk, more than 1150 sailors died
People did not starve to death, but securing the food supply was a priority
Rationing was introduced
Inflation was runaway
The shipping magnates got rich, while ordinary people suffered
Yes, I know
I was just saying it's interesting to see it in these pictures
Yeah, but far from all on Karl Johan
Exactly
I know you're joking, but we weren't Swedish :D We practically spoke Danish in Oslo at that time
Even though *nynorsk* and *riksmål* were up and coming by the 1890s.
Curiously, the 1920s revision of our Constitution was written in what seemed almost Danish to us now
You should probably read your source more carefully
That was the first _UK commercial network_.  NMT operated commercially in Scandinavia way before that
Quoting your own source:
> It wasn’t even the first cellular service, the Nordics had NMT as early as 1981 and AT&T had launched AMPs in Chicago in 1983, but the UK launch was massively significant, although even Vodafone and Cellnet didn’t realise it at the time
Hehe, ok, I hear you Danes have trouble discerning between spoken Swedish and Norwegian, but I didn't think it included written ;)

I'm stuck and I have no idea for how long
I can quarantine
Test requirement not available from here
I'm stuck and unemployed where I am now, couch surfing
Granted, it's covid-safe where I am and I get benefits
I guess I could force my way through, with a stiff test and hotel budget in a place where I would actually be at risk of catching it, with no guarantee that the country is not locked up by the time I'm there
I have the sense that the Netherlands will not lift this deterrent to travel before April or May
This has been many of the threads over at /r/Norway the last year
Amazing that people don't understand that travelling during a pandemic is a bad idea
There's now a two test requirement
Test 1: not available where I am (an arctic island)
I'd have to fly to the capital (Oslo) which is currently under supa dupa strict lockdown, and where I'd actually have a risk of catching it
Test 2: cannot find information about it
Flight connections are also pretty bad these days and involve going through Denmark, which is also trying to deter everyone
There's a real risk of going to Oslo and being stuck there for a few weeks due to a new regulation, being denied boarding, having to buy 1000€ last minute tickets
We are also not taking the government advice lightly: do not come
Do not travel unnecessarily
Don't go to Oslo
Don't leave your municipality

Bro, 3 degrees
Spring is finally on its way
It's crazy how fast the temperature changes
Last week I was freezing on my eyes when I blinked because we had like -15 degrees in Norway and bow I don't even need my jacket outside
Honestly scary
2 weeks ago we had like 2 meters of snow and -15 degrees, now most of the snow is gone and it's like 5 degrees
Almost a 30 degree change in temperature in a little over a week
To be fair, guys from mountain regions tend to have a pretty flexible opinion on when it's warm enough to wear shorts

Thats's right
What people need to understand is that the other US presidents are equally bad or worse
Take Obama as an example just because he is so well liked: opened the arctic to oil drilling, currently goes around bragging about he's the one who did fracking, took the US from two armed conflicts to seven (one of them Libya), expanded the surveillance state and aggressively prosecuted whistleblowers under the espionage act - which in turn made the US drop 29 spots in the press freedom rankings by reporters without borders, admitted people were tortured - only to go on and say he would held no one responsible because it was "behind them now and it's about looking forward", built the cages on the border, deported more people than Trump etc
But it's all fine because he did them politely
I fear it will be the same with Mr
Biden
(who btw not only voted for the Iraq war, but actively shamed those who didn't)
Trump was just a symptom, the rot runs deep
it’s easier to plan with china, but it’s morally wrong
He is a glory to Europe

At the start of WWII, Britian was critically lacking SMGs, and bought Thompsons from USA
According to [this] source, a Thompson costed $209 to produce in 1939, and $70 in 1942
A Sten-gun costed $11 in 1942 (~$130 today with inflation)
The Sten required only around 5 man-hours to produce
Additional fun fact, the BAR costed $319 to produce in 1945, while the StG44 costed $26 in 1944
Important to note that it's not a perfect comparison, due to the complexities of the different economies of the nations, but it does show how much cheaper stamping is compared to milling in an arms production context
Here is the thing, my parents are vegetarian and I have never had the oppertunity to try lutefisk

Honestly don’t have a problem with brutalist architecture if done properly
It can look relatively clean and minimalistic while also saving costs and providing housing to more people per dollar
the purpose they served was to promote urbanisation, and therefore industrialisation, as suddenly there were large amounts of cheap urban housing
commieblocks aren’t exclusive to wartorn countries, there’s many in sweden and norway for example

Freedom of speech is the freedom to not be censored by the state/goverment
Universities in the UK are, if i remember correctly, independent of the state

I have some friends visiting family on the Faroe Islands at the moment
They are further south, but only has 13 degrees
But this is the first summer I'm jealous of them
*I’m swimming in the rain*...
Yeah this is extreme
We had a very cold early spring/late winter and now a very hot summer
Yeah it do be like that sometimes
Its perhaps the hottest place in the US when you measure both humidity and temperatures aka heat index
Texas and Florida I'd say
Its harder for humans to cope with 40 degree 55% heat in Dallas than it is to deal with 52 degree heat in Arizona or Death Valley, California
Similarly, the Arabian gulf coast has temperatures as high or higher than Arizona but the humidity of Texas
Its hell on Earth, the entire region has to be air conditioned soon
Same with Southern Pakistan and Northern India
High humidity + high desert like temperatures
Similarly, 35 degrees Celsius in Thailand or Singapore with 80% humidity is equal to the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth(57 Celsius)
A very hot day would be like 38 degrees with a humidity of 80% which equals a staggering 71 degrees Celsius
Record was 79c and was reached in Saudi Arabia
The US government says anything above a heat index of 54c is 'extreme danger, heat stroke imminent'. I lived in those temperatures in Thailand for years when I didn't have AC
Never got heat stroke, neither did the entire region who live there
I am guessing the index doesn't take into account being acclimatized
My sisters friend did have a heat stroke(I think) and collapsed in the street during a hot and humid day in Thailand
She was young and slim but wasn't acclimatized
Had to go buy a bunch of cold water from 7/11 and dunk her head in it
He turned out fine though
You get used to it but its no fun, came back to Norway during a decently warm winter(last year) and froze like hell in 23c weather, now I am acclimatized again are sweating in 30 degree weather with 40-50% humidity-_- That would be freezing to me only a year ago
In Thailand we'd wear literal winter jackets in 30c weather down there
When it got close to 25c the entire region buys winter hats and gloves etc
It looks odd as hell to see people in the tropics wear winter-jackets, gloves and hats in tropical weather but people have literally frozen to death down there in 20c weather haha
At 25c people(me included) would literally shake because of the cold, its so odd
I think you meant that they pawed way
They got the skiing and boats right, but who is dancing I wonder
Honestly really accurate

>Critics of Article 13 have argued that there’s only one way platforms could do this: upload filters
These automatically check all uploaded content to see whether it’s copyrighted or not
If the filter detects copyrighted content – it doesn’t make it onto the platform
>But concerns have been raised about how that will work in practice
It obviously won't, because you can't check every entire work against all other entire works as part of an upload, so there are going to be lots and lots of false positives
Let alone being able to add reliable exemptions for fair use
At least this won't be implemented right away, and some countries are bound to make a mess of the process before being able to put in place a system that consistently makes a mess for everyone else
In the meantime, people need to vote for politicians and parties committed to stop and undo this
And then start working on legislation that cuts back on the existing regressive and ridiculous IP laws and regulations
Death plus 70 years, it makes no sense
The question becomes, is it enforceable
And will enforcement be equal and fair

What happens if i live in norway
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Are there any active groups that want to end the centralized EU government but that still wants to keep free trade, free movement and free immigration within the EU
Because this whole huge EU state doesn't seem to be going to well
It indeed is
I hope the career of the 300+ corrupt politician that voted in favor of this end up with their career in flames
Does the law apply in the “European economic area”? Specifically Norway
And party suicide for any party that didn't at least have a large group voting against
The problem is that the UK has the likes of Theresa May in charge, and they're no more friendly to the free internet
They're even opposed to encryption
Wait, it’ll take two years to implement
We got loads of time to get them to repeal it then, right
Because of the Euro Trade Zone agreements (EØS) we have, I’m fairly sure this affects us as well
But I think we have the power to reverse the law by making an exception for it in our own copyright laws
Don't care if probably the wrong word
Most people probably don't even realise the consequences and of many that might have understood, they might have naively believed there was no way the EU was stupid enough to pass it
Maybe nothing can be done about it in the near future, but we have to start working on it if we want to be able to make positive changes in the long term
At some point the average lifespan (or at least privileged people's lifespan) is going to increase faster than copyrighted works enter the public domain
And AI tech is going to change the reality of how works are created and maintained
While wealth inequality continues to increase, and those who control the most resources will have an increasing competitive edge, or own more and more IP
We'll get it further down the line at some point
I don't trust our politicians to reject it when the two largest parties happily voted to implement the Data Retention Directive, despite it being a violation of our constitution

I want to thank Swedes for portraying Norway's resistance movement, that we are very proud of, in the Battlefield series
No wait actually it was terrible and showed no respect at all
Not officially but Norwegian fighters where left to operate fairly freely in Sweden
There was a large contingent of Norwegian refugees in Sweden and they set up organizations with  lines of communication back to the government in exile in Britain
In order to maintain their Neutrality Sweden didn't allow military operations based from their territory at first and they sometimes turned away refugees caught on the border, but the Norwegians where allowed to train a "police force" and from 1943 onward they took a more Allied friendly approach and allowed Norwegians in Sweden to train military units and even launch covert operations from Swedish territory and smuggle weapons, by the end of the war there where 14
000 Norwegian soldiers based in Sweden
Although they never saw battle they allowed the Norwegian government to swiftly move in and take custody of surrendering German troops and arrest collaborators once German forces surrendered at the end of the war
kinda but not officially
since sweden was officially neutral the government didn’t aid directly
but since they were a neutral country alot of officials fleed there, and alot of military operations ended there as they could flee there afterwards
kinda unrelated, but my great-grandfather was a resistance fighter, who kidnapped two high ranking nazis during the occupation, and was able to drag both of them with him to sweden where he waited the rest of it out
*Oh boy can't wait to see what Narvik looks li~*

we don’t exactly know all the details, because he’s very old, and quite senile at this point, but i just asked my mom
apperently it wasn’t germans, but a norwegian "sheriff" (for lack of better term) and one of his policemen, who collaborated with, and became nazis themselves
we don’t know what happened when they got to sweden, he says they were put in a norwegian prison camp or something, which is wierd
but idk
that’s what he has told us at least
and he really isn’t a boisterous type
this was the first and last ever time he spoke of his experience during the war, so i don’t see why he would lie

Norway is essentially a non-voting member of the EU (with a few exceptions), including being part of the Schengen area
Belarus has some visa free programs for those in Schengen and a few other countries, or at least it looks that way from a quick google search

I hope Le Pen doesnt win
although if Emmanuel Macron wins i hope something happens in the EU
i really like the idea of EU, but we need to do something about how it works
the hate against EU is increasing exponentially, ofcoure with the help of foreign propoganda (Russia), but still, we cant take all the non europe immigrants etc
Europe needs you
The only thing French people need to do is vote for whatever they feel benefit themselves and  their country the most
Not for the benefit of other countries or some vaguely defined "Europe", or what someone on Reddit tells you to
That's not democracy
I still think calling that snap election was dirty tactics
and a hard Brexit will probably ensue, potentially worsening UK/EU relations further and possibly weaken the union, given that the isolationist sentiment gains foothold in other European nations

Macron is ready to defend Merkel if anything happens, and Brigitte is honestly just ready to see some juicy shit go down
A second later they smile and shake hands with Putin
Don’t be for this reason

Yeah, the Romanian one looked good for that reason, at least from an outsider perspective

She’s actually not Minister of Health, but Minister of Elders Care and Public Health
She is pretty right wing, had a short term as Minister of Legal affairs, but had to go after a Facebook post accusing the Labour Party for supporting terrorists
Totally anti Islam, climate change denier and rude as hell
Showing up with her crucifix around her neck and touting about “good old Norwegian Christian values”, spreading more hate and controversy
Sorry, truth be spoken
This is the same women that you saw on last week tonight, floating around in the Mediterranean in a big red life jacket to experience how it is to be a migrant crossing the ocean
Then she was the minister of immigration
Wonder what she's going to do now
She's also a right wing populist that was ousted through a vote of no confidence as the minister of justice after saying the opposing party AP was prioritizing terrorist lives before that of the country on facebook
Which isn't acceptable for a person in power to say
you don't need to be healthy to be a minister of health
just like you don't need to foreign affairs and be foreign
you just need to make sure the healthcare system works
she's probably more fitted for that job than any nurse
It's how it usually goes with right-wing governments everywhere
Terrible choices all around
As a Norwegian, that is pretty darn gross
I like her though, she wants people to be well informed and after that be able to make their own decisions about what they want to do without being judged for it
Her opinion is that the government shouldn't regulate what people are allowed or not allowed to do
Meget mystisk
To be fair, stand outside a hospital and you'll see countless doctors and nurses taking smoke breaks
You can see that's she's Norwegian because she's drinking Pepsi Max

Here we go again
Looking at a lot of the comments, it continuously amazes me that so many people do not know about this
It is an integral part of how the Earth has worked for billions of years and still, somehow, lots of people in the year 2020 have not heard of the concept of winters without sunrise and summers without sunset
Obviously I have a different perspective on this since I’m from a country where this occurs (though not in my area, luckily I’m too far south), but still, it just boggles my mind
We just suck it up
Fish oil, vitamin C, and sunlight lamps are also good for survival
At no point is there *not* sun during the summer, though
If it's not cloudy, that is
To us, it just feels like how things are supposed to be
If I go further south during the summer, for example, even only as far as Oslo/Bergen, it feels *very* weird when the sun goes down and it's still warm outside
To us, polar night and midnight sun are normal
We've had snow 3-4 times here in Eastern Norway, actually a good amount but every time theres been a warm period after
Like, lots of snow, then warm weather that removes all the snow, repeat
Rn theres no snow at all

i swear the only reason I would want Norway to be a part of the EU and not EØS is to be a part of all these graphs and stats about the EU
I always look for Norway and we're never there :(
Now do one about Norway
Still no Norway :( 100% renewable since always
Wish EEA member would be included here
Norway’s energy production is 98-99% hydro, while the rest are also renewable, like wind and solar panels
Fairly sure Svalbard uses coal, since wind, solar and hydro obviously aren’t viable
And Sweden's neighboor, Norway are at 98% renewable
99% for the mainland
This is because of hydro power, which works very good due to all the mountains and stuff
However, hydro power is a no-no in the ignorant renewable energy debate because solar and wind are the only ones that count
this is in eu countries though
Rather let countries like the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia who couldt give a shit about the globe gain money instead
And as a dane is it not hypocritical to call out Norway on mineral fuel exports, while mineral fuel exports are the fastest growing export in Denmark
Yes, and we are all perfectly aware of that
But it's all supply by demand
We don't need the oil our self but will continue to produce and sell as long as other countries want it
And share our oil money
Pfffft
Haha, no
Seriously, we don't benefit from joining it when we are doing fine on our own
Yeah, I know, but Norway is EU Lite
Yes
And you could build nuclear
Norway is part of Europe continent, Not part of the European union
honestly, if we ever hold another referendum i would probably vote to join the eu
"Mineral fuels including oil was the fastest-growing among the top 10 export categories, up 15
4% in value from 2017 to 2018
And I said mineral fuels, oil alone migh have gone down
We just use our oily greed as a joke to not join the EU
The fact is that Norway wouldn't benefit from most of the trade rules and stuff that the EU enforces
And we have always kept a neutral and free standing position in world politics, just like Switzerland and Iceland
The situation is more or less that we get to choose which of the laws we want to follow, but not get a hand in deciding the laws in the EU parliament
Agriculture in general, because mountainous Norway is not a good place for agriculture, and yet a common policy has been to opt for self-sufficient food production when possible
Also, technically we don't have to follow all the rules (we have an opt-out to any given resolution, IIRC), but Norway has consistently followed a policy of implementing any and all EU resolutions
Norway is interesting
I think we naturally have a healthy diet of vegetables, fish and potatoes, but in the past decades we’ve become super meat and dairy based and definitely eat so much more junk food than we used to

I’m sure the brits understood what I was trying to say, you need to speak British if you make fun of brits
Yes but what if you go by more important statistics like the number of NFL players per capita, suddenly Sweden doesn't look so great
Kinda confused, compared Norway and US, and the only pros for moving to the US was money spent on health care and electricity
The health care confused me, as we got our cheap health care
Looking at WHO where the stats were taken from, Norway has a total expenditure on health per capita lower than the US
(Stats from 2014 though, ~6400 to ~9400, both in $) The site says it takes both private, employer and public into account, so i'm sure miss a stat somewhere that sets it straight, but nevertheless i wonder if anyone knows why there's such a disparity from the site to the WHO total stats
Edit: Couldn't find much about it, but if employer is included, then i guess it could make more sense
But i still wonder if where the info came from exactly, as it's kinda huge difference compared to what the site states
More money AND slightly less for health care
I'll stay
The 29% more money statistic is misleading
I'm guessing they've already accounted for tax, because the real difference is in the lower single digits
Compare that to the fact that Americans pay for every single thing they do
welp

(Hyperbole) I wasn't expecting to be so right as to have a scandal every other day though
This way, maybe some will learn the hard way
Ok, that was only part of the reason, mostly i wanted to see what things he could fuck up
I was curious, the same curiosity that draws you to click on NSFW /r/wtf links
I think the biggest surprise was that someone how doesn't seem able to speak like a grown up, got to be president
(I must add though, i saw a clip where he did indeed sound very sincere/serious, in a style of someone had died kinda tone
I kinda respected that
Unfortunately, that's not the norm
Trump is kinda like a weekly comic that everyone reads, it gets brought up and everyone knows whats going on in the latest issue
Well, that's my view/experience, i hope i didn't come off too offensively, but it's just how the whole situation feels like
I think America is a great country, know a few nice people, and been there once
But the issues are there, and they seem to be rooted rather deeply
I think black people are more likely to go to prison if they're born into criminal hoods where selling drugs and murder is everyday business, not simply because of their skin color
too close to call
Because Norway is a very expensive country with a small population spread out over a huge geographical area
The country actually covers three time zones but only use one
We don't **spend** more on electricity, we **use** more electricity
*All* our electric power is made by hydro-electric plants, and since it's snowing eight months a year and raining five, there's a lot of water that needs to go through our rivers
Which gives us nearly free electricity, so we waste a lot
It does not say we spend more money on electricety, just that we *use* more
In Norway electricity is cheap due to good acsess to water (98-99% of the electricety production is from water)
Also we have a lot of power demanding industry like aliminium production
From July-Septemper 2015 the prices was 0,04 euro for a kW/h. Suorce:
In Scandinavia it's usually because of the higher wages
In Norway you will earn a base salary of $18/hr as a waiter for example
Food items are usually taxed less
Yes and in particular in the northern rural areas which have led to those working there paying less in taxes and Norwegians may get their student debt paid off by working there for instance
And the lack of nurses all over the country is why I used to speak somewhat understandable Icelandic since I used to date a lot of Icelandic nurses in Oslo
It’s glorious
Sane people (and teachers) of Italy, you have a job to do
This can't be true
What are they teaching about the Holocaust in schools in Italy
Many reasons as listed in comments and i like to add that the news outlets have become less trustworthy as well because of copy paste journalism, clickbait and personal opinions instead of facts, this in turn leads people to be more suspicious of other sources of information as well, but still people don't know how to fact check
This meme is silly, the Finnish practice in Saunas all winter so they probably handle heat better than most Northerners
I fucking love my AC, no one else in Norway has one =\)
Been somewhere around 24-26ºC here today and I swear I've sweated off a kg or two while at work
Send help to norway im melting
Plenty of Norwegians have heat pumps for the winter, which also doubles as AC if you want it to
We are used to the average temp being around 5 degerees
-10 in the winter, +15 in sumer, and bipolar during the spring/autumn
The sun sets forever over Blackwater Park
Should be illegal to deny workers chairs
I see a lot of cashiers are also forced to stand up
When I worked as one as a teen, I luckily had a chair
I think my back would have been completely busted by now if not, I'm very tall so I'd have to hunch down to reach the register, it already kills me to use the kitchen bench and stuff
Mmm
can you smell that capitalism
Oh, no wait someone forgot to put the lid on the garbage can outside
Isn't the union doing anything about it
Literally a block chain
I think Norway is very much the same with the Nordic countries - especially the Scandinavian ones
But I think we'd trust both Germany and France more than GB and Russia
But that doesn't mean we don't like GB at least
I know a lot of Norwegians and Brits work and reside in each other's countries
They're still part of Europe, so they're relatives, you know
But there's just so much going on there
I feel like the US has lost a lot of trust, though
Most of the people I know had a more positive view on the US during the Obama presidency, but since Trump they're critiziced (often as the butt end of jokes) a lot here
Our politics are worlds apart
Germans got it right
Same in Norwegian: Frankrike
Have you seen thr Trump and his actions
You know who and what Putin is
You know you can expect him to stick to deals he makes
Trump
Putin is in many ways terrifying, but at least you can trust him
They don't consider Crimea Ukrainian though
Maybe partly because the almost 90% Russian population who also in large part support becoming Russian
Except in Crimea they identify as Russians and were Russian before Ukraine separated
It's all fun and games playing with the americans, but hopefully the EU will eventually learn to stand up to the far worse predators in Russia and China
They don't want to comply with e.g. a common standard for chargers, also they kind of lock you in many ways into their eco-system
It's also really hard to repair without breaching guarantee-rules and so on
If you enlighten us regarding how Switzerland have taken on these giants, maybe posters here from EU-countries could take inspiration from your country and tell their EU-representatives (to kind of point them in a better direction)

I think if you really wanted to offend Norwegians you should label it as Denmark (or Denmark-Norway)
i... simply don’t understand mine
QUISLINGIA
F*CKER
Real classy to label Norway with a nazi name
Yeah I think the insulting worked
What's the yellow above the Papal States
My guess is that OP is Swedish
Norway was offended, but it like a queer kinda not understanding offending
More offending would be giving the northern pets to Finland and the south eastern part to Sweden
I don't get it
Some island
Which seems really weird given how original Norway's new name is
My suggestion would be to call it "Norway" or "That country that *willing* worked with the Nazis" and then make Finland "East Russia"
Oh no, Sweden got the worst burn out of anyone on this map
Should’ve given Bohuslen, Jemtland and Herjedalen to Quislingia
That might’ve done the trick
but the one nazi they mentioned wasn't hitler, but a Norwegian
Skåne is already Danish and no Swedes have a clue what they're saying down there anyway
I like you description of Vidkun Quisling as that one Norwegian nazi and not as Norways biggest traitor
Showed this to my serb wife
She literally asked me, "What am I supposed to look at

Since this post is 4 hours old, this will probably be buried and never seen, but either way, here are some before and after pictures taken by my dad, who grew up in Sweden
They had a [pretty nifty logo] for the H-day
Really
I had absolutely no idea
Britain has a lot less reason to switch sides than Sweden did, since Britain is on some islands and only has land borders with Ireland, which also drives on the left, and Sweden is mostly mainland, with dozens of land border crossings with two countries that already drove on the right
Not that it wouldn't be funny to watch them try, but
Almost a year ago I visited the UK and figured that renting a car from London to Liverpool was the easiest way to travel
I drew the short straw and had to drive but it went surprisingly well
It's very weird at first but people adapt easily

This type of behavior should mean you risk being banned from copyrighting works
Copyright exists for the common good, not to shut down creativity or access to the public domain, and not to allow corporations ownership of culture
By behavior, I'm including what's done on your behalf by people or programs
Repeated false claims is a threat to what copyright is meant to protect and encourage
Fuck that
No one owns the music of Bach
It's public domain
If Sony seriously claims to own his compositions then I just lost a lot of respect for the company
However, it seems like this might have been an isolated incident caused by a failure in Youtube's content ID system, so it seems that Sony doesn't actually claim to own Bach's music
The problem with EU is that people think people like Farage is unique in the EU parliament
He's not
The EU parliament is a not a technocracy of experts, but a collection of mostly ignorant people voted in without any form of vetting process or formal qualifications needed what so ever
Sounds like your local politicians
Indeed it is
Probably much worse, since people just don't care about who they vote in
Voter turnout is abysmal to the point of being undemocratic, with a turnout falling to ~40% and sometimes even in the 30's.
And now they control the faith of the global internet and over 700 million people
Why does this look so photoshopped to me
They do the same in norway, at least up in the parts where i am from
They do this in norway too, ut I think it's to not blind the driver, and to be nice to tired travelers
How are they supposed to get their morning nap with lights on
Ever since I watched trainspotting, I've always wanted to visit this place

Oslo has not been a true capital city for more than 115 years or so, though
Oslo got forcibly moved from its original location in 1624 to its current location by danish King Christian IV who renamed the new city “Christiania” after himself
The modern Oslo got developed in two phases, the 1890s and the 1950s and 60s.
You realize that increased average temperatures doesn't actually mean that we'll get the same temperatures, but slightly warmer, right
Cause if it did; we'd all be very, very dead
Climate change causes _average_ temperature to increase, but does so via more extreme temperatures; meaning you get to see more days of extreme cold and more days of extreme heat, with fewer in-between days
The amount this probably created is absolutely negible compared to other major factors climate change i’m sure
Like air travel, the un-renewable energy industry, just private motor vehicle transportation accounts for 12% of global emmisions
While i don’t disagree with you, it’s important to note that this might not be the case everywhere, as regional differences and the fundamental uncertainty of climate change makes it hard to give a single, short and simple answer
For example, where i live the winters are getting warmer, so much so that where i used to see snow every winter as a kid, and our local janitor would pump water over the lake to create smooth ice for skating, and pile all the snow in the school courtyard into one big pile for us to play in, there’s now just sloppy mush a few days of winter and dead grass the rest, and our summers are getting warmer aswell
Overall it’s just getting warmer here
Not any colder
Just more warmth and more rain
Scandinavia in a nutshell
We don't hate Sweden, we just regard them as our somewhat mentally challenged cousin
Denmark cool though
We go on holidays there and visit Legoland and buy cheap booze
Edit: But, yes
Finnish is giberish
Everyone hates Sweden
Norway and Denmark like each other
Finland is a lovable goof
I'm Norwegian, and I love Denmark and I think of Sweden as the big brother I say I hate, but secretly admire and want to emulate
Finland is more like the cousin I never see, but I think is pretty cool and I wish would come visit more often
This is wrong on almost all accounts
Here's the correct version
* Norway: hates Sweden
Loves Denmark and Finland
* Denmark: hates Sweden
Loves Norway and Finland
* Finland: hates Sweden
Loves Denmark and Norway
* Sweden: hates Denmark, Norway and Finland
10 points if you notice a pattern here
Poor Sweden
PS: "hate" here is like a sibling rivalry, not Pakistan/India or USA/Russia kind of hatred
Reading through the comments - I had no idea everybody loves us so much
Heartwarming
Nowegians love Denmark, and they kind of like us
Swedes annoy us
No, Danish and Finnish is gibberish
Danish might be related to Germanic languages but it sounds even worse than Finnish
But I love Sweden and Denmark
Ja minä rakastan Suomi
Can't wait to federate and leave the EU in the dust
We love swedish danseband (vikingarna 4 life), Ullared cinematic universe (En stark resa med Morgan & Ola-Conny academy award when
), cheap snus and alcohol, and going on camping holidays in Sweden
In Denmark, we love even cheaper alcohol and pipe tobacco, Legoland, going on holidays there, and the cruise ships going to Denmark (Danskebåten)
At least in Northern Norway, we love Finland because it's somehow still cheaper than Norway, and of course the holiday opportunities (Norwegian riviera in Oulu), [but they don't seem to like us]
I’m glad that we have something in common
Nobody hates Norway and Sweden, but everyone hates Denmark
Yes
Piirka is that you
I think you’re misinformed buddy, Sweden and Norway love each other we can just be a bit mean at times
What we have in common though, is that we both hate Denmark
This one is correct
> Don't think anybody hates Norway,
Guess where I will spend next summer holiday
They are cool but the Danish spoken language is also slowly degrading into meaningless, guttural noises, as reported in [this] documentary
The Danes aren't correcting each other because they are too nice, the Norwegians mind their own business, no one cares what the swedes think and Finnish is gibberish
Its a very serious concern for the future of Denmark
Yeah, and we just think Sweden is lame, but don't hate them either
Look at us as best friends
We all love each other, but as all best friends do we call each other fucked up things and say we "hate" one another
This chart was probably made by a scandi by the fact that the chart is just a joke
Hva faen sa du akkurat om meg din lille svenskejævel
Du skal vite at jeg ble uteksaminert som den beste i klassen min i marinen, og har vært involvert i utallige hemmelige raid mot Al-Quaeda, og at jeg har over 300 bekreftede drap

Du er ingenting annet til meg enn enda en skyteskive
Jeg skal fjerne deg fra jordens overflate med en presisjon som slike som deg aldri har sett før i manns minne, merk mine ord

Tro om igjen svenskejævel
Mens vi snakker nå kontakter jeg mitt hemmelige spionnettverk over hele Norge og din IP-adresse blir sporet akkurat nå så du burde forberede deg på stormen, din mark

Du er faen meg dø, drittunge
Jeg kan være hvor som helst, når som helst, og jeg kan drepe deg på sju hundre ulike måter, og det bare med mine bare hender
Ikke bare er jeg grundig trent i ubevæpnet kamp, men jeg har også tilgang på hele den norske marinens arsenal og jeg vil bruke dens fulle omfang til å tilintetgjøre ditt elendige rasshøl fra kontinentets overflate, din lille dritt
Hvis du bare kunne ha visst hvilken redselsfull hevn din lille "smarte" kommentar var i ferd med å ramme deg, ville du kanskje ha holdt kjeft
Med du klarte det ikke, og du gjorde det ikke, og nå vil du betale prisen, din svenskejævel
Jeg vil drite vrede over hele deg, og du vil drukne i det
Du er faen meg død småen

The one kebab place in my city is unbeatable if you want *really* spicy kebabs (as in Pepper X level and such)
They are also delicious beyond that
That must be one of the most highly contested titles in the world
Every Nordic city has like two kebab joints on every corner
I'm not even kidding when I say the ratio of kebab places to citizens in Scandinavia is higher than anywhere else in the world
You know Sweden is shit when the only good thing about it is fucking kebabs
Gang violence and periodic instability in ghettos, Islamic terror is worth it because there is a now easy to get a kebab
lol Sweden: the world would truly be more boring without you
Sincerely, Norway
We do, unlike you Swedes we don't see ourselves as mere beasts
But hey if you Swedes are happy thinking of yourselves that lowly then fine
They're in Strömstad
Shhh don't ask questions you don't want answer to
So i did my research and i find Norway richer in all the sites i look at
What site did you use
Because it might have been some years ago when that was published or i cannot trust the world bank
Haha, that sounds like you spent a lot of time "rationalizing" why Sweden is better
I wonder why you feel the need to list why your country is the best
>Generally the further north you go the worse it gets
Ain't that the truth

Yeah :D
One of the many Norwegian words for dog is 'Bikje' which obviously is related to 'Bitch and Bicce'. We use it for dogs in general though, 'Tispe' is the female specific name for dog nowadays
To specify a male dog we just say 'Hanhund' which literally translates to 'He-hound'. Simple
I don't really trust wikipedia, but it may be right in 2014, but i think we are richer nowadays, well atleast after what i looked at
Ok, but that does not have anything to do with it if i trust it or not
Also, very judgemental and very Swedish of you :)
I also said it may be right, but it is in 2014
And i did not see it was from the nordic counsil and it may be changed because that is what you can do on wikipedia
Oh ok, thanks for clarifying that
Either way we are all gonna spend it on beer from Denmark
I know
It's in our nature
It implies that the Romanians nicked the Jack
Yeah, independence is not about economics, it’s about nationalism
Which is fine I guess - but it’s intellectually dishonest to claim brexit/Scottish independence would be economically beneficial or neutral
When Norway ditched EU membership in 1972 and Sweden joined, whole factories were packed up and moved from Norway to Sweden to be inside EU
They never came back
And the ruling parties really wanted us in
That is why we had two referendums, and when both failed, we joined the EEA anyway
What
Sweden didn't join the EU in 1972
That is due to govermental control of natural resources and smart investing of the funds from those resources
Main reasons the «no»-vote won (52,2%):
People feared the EU would take away our power and right to rule
This was even more important in 1994 than in 1972, as the EU had become more ambitious and included more countries (and more potential countries)
People had a (false) perception that the EU would harm the welfare state
Rural Norway were very much against the EU, and rallied in greater numbers than the others
They therefore dominated media and won voters
The pro EU side used the wrong arguments
They focused on the fear of being isolated, when we had already gone since 1972 alone without problem and had joined the EEA
It was basically the best thing to do
Some people still complain, but we would not have the same benefits without the EU
They're Danish
No one understands what they say
The UK has about the same amount of oil as us
The real difference lies in who it enriches

My mom works in import, and all I hear her complaining about all day is how much pain in the ass it is getting stuff from the UK to Norway
We have a bilateral treaty with the UK though
You won't have to if the declared value is under a certain threshold
Here in Norway its about $1000
Cars also go under different rules, they're like one of the few things you cant get into countries without paying extra fees
Though the friend could send you a stash of Pokemon cards worth $500k, declare them as $999 and a gift, and you'd pay no VAT, customs fees or anything
Yes, but she imports food items so it has to be cleared
All I know is that their container of caramels has been sitting in some UK harbor for 3 weeks now
That's right, I think he prefers eating people over cats and dogs
Though your extreme example would probably be inspected and fail ;) The customs agents would send you a nice bill and fine :)
Ah, that explains it
Well, as long as it's under the threshold it still counts
You should be able to get a record for that price
Good riddance

The weather in Trondheim is weird
Yesterday there were no clouds at all during daytime
At night it was all cloudy, and as live somewhat up in the mountains, I can see the city and the other side of the fjord, and it was all clouds
Then it’s day again and no clouds at all over the city or the horison
Now it’s evening again and now it’s all cloudy

In Norway too, Oslo lost a lot of its gems in the 60s and 70s because things should be modernised and car friendly
A group from the city council went to the US after the war and got ideas
Luckily not all of the motorway projects were put into live, but enough were
They teared down enough old grandiose buildings as well to build the ugliest brutalist buildings around
They even planned on demolish entire boroughs and neighbourhoods to make them more ‘efficient’, Corbusier style
Unfortunately they did some of it, but luckily not all of it
The old has been more appreciated later, the ‘architecture’ from 60s and 70s has not
Well, there MAY have been other considerations other than "jealousy".

Norwegian party leaders having a Christmas debate
Topics include: favorite movies, dinner and silly outfits
It makes me glad i live in europe and not the US
The guy in the 5th picture, Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, is actually bald, he is wearing a wig
I thought that was pretty funny
I think he did it to look like the two female politicians
Trygve Slagsvold Vedum with a wig is the best thing I've ever seen
Why generalise for the entirety of Europe
And why even bring up the US
Debatten "The Debate" is fun and interesting at the same time
And the host "Fredrik Solvang" is like the Jeremy Clarkson of Norway
Mostly reacognized, makes jokes, good program host, and can be serious

Hey thats sounds important too
Not nearly as crazy
There are some really small parties that are, though
Believe it or not, it wasn't meant to be so inflammatory
It is just them showing up on TV for a bit of fun
It was just good fun, 0% serious debate, mostly banter
This was only the leaders of the 4 largest parties, would usually be 8-9 in a proper debate
It also wasn't a full debate, but part of kvelden før kvelden, a show that runs on NRK every year on the 23rd(40+ years)
Edit: Some clips from the debate
Edit2: Also, snap elections/dissolving the parliament isnt a thing in Norway/not possible because of the constitution
there is a debate on tv multiple times per week, but not necessarily with politicians
the only times they mentioned politics in this one was for banter, because it was a Christmas special
> Wikipedia says no election till september 2021
We have a functioning democracy
We don't go like "Shit, only 2 months until election
Need to have those debates NOW
We have debates Thursdays and Tuesdays on current topics
These are not "official debates", but rather the debates scheduled by the national broadcaster
There is a _really high_ bar to decline an invitation
Even the PM can't simply "not show up". If you are relevant to the topic, you go
Every few months, there will be party leader debates
Simply because times changes, and the media will push all the party leaders on what they have done the past few months
Furthermore, the Broadcaster also has a radio show (which is also sent on live TV) every single day, where topics of current events are talked about
Here all the relevant people are also invited, and just like the debates, the bar for not showing, is really really high
Politicians basically can't refuse
The only real way to not show, is if there is pre planned government business that takes priority
But that will only get you of the hook until the next broadcast
TL;DR: We have debates twice a week on current topics
It's political suicide not to show up
Ministers and party leaders are present in almost every broadcast
"Party leader debates" are held at regular intervals
Yep
I think so, but i don't know if it is translated
Im left wing, but calling Fremskrittspartiet far-right is a bit of a stretch
Id call them right-wing, probably  somewhere between democrats and republicans, though its really hard to make a comparison to US politics
I dunno about everyone
I mean iceland yeah, but there are worse places
It was pretty funny
It was absolutely hilarious, I loved every second of it
Common we have Teslas, singlehandedly saving the planet up here
I don't think that's a fair comparison
Norway's money is still fairly new
Oil was found in 1969, took a few years after that before it was in production so a lot of the population was alive at that time
And the boomers are the ones who reaped most of the benefits

Why
Uhh, no
In Norway 40% eat ribbe on christmas eve, and 39% pinnekjøtt, which is largely an eastern/western divide
So it is actually a pretty big topic
Yes
Poland
Alabama
Why do they wash it with chemicals
What are EU's problem with GMO's? Chemically washed chicken meat coming from chickens raised under horrible conditions I can understand
But why GMO's?
How the fuck, can a company demand EU to change its food hygiene standard because of the U.S trade deficit ?
Why the flying fuck cant they just change their products ?
And if the thing the US wants so desperatly to trade overseas with isn't up to the standards of the nation/block they are interesting in trading with
Maybe they need to improve their standards
Ah I didn't know
You got a source for that
Well, that is a very good point
Thanks for the link
> Ever heard of Google
In general that is the answer a person without a source would give
Was hoping not having to read through 550 comments
So nice
This is what we need to do in Norway too
This is not classical architecture
It's renaissance, which means it uses plaster to create the illusion of classical features (fake columns, etc) and often with limited understanding of or adherence to classical architecture, which is highly formalized
I can't tell from the image but I'm pretty sure they mix column orders in their pilasters, which is one big no-no
> Have we finally gotten over the drunken stupor that has devoured the entire architecture world after WW2
Modernist architecture was well established before WW2 (and [reviled by the Nazis] as "degenerate art"), and there have been so many distinct movements within the world of architecture _since_ WW2 that it's hard to read this criticism as anything deeper than "I wish buildings were nice and old-timey".
That's fine if you want to live in a museum city but there are very real reasons why architecture has evolved, and if you want nice cities then you need to assess buildings on a deeper qualitative level than "modern sucks, give me stucco".
You could call second-wave postmodernism and brutalism drunken stupors if you want and I'd be inclined to agree, but one thing's for sure; they're not the *same* drunken stupor
The building was remodelled when renaissance was out of fashion
Now those decorative elements are not passé but retro, so it's being put back up
(There is an irony there, considering that those renaissance facades are themselves just chintzy stucco imitations of classical architecture)
It's all about fads and by judging a building solely on how you feel about the general architectural style you're just as much a part of that as the people who tore down the stucco
At least [the Grand Hotel in Oslo] looks good  :)
I think that picture was taken with Kodak JPEG ASA 200
You can't build with copper cladding anymore because we didn't like how it killed the environment
Sort of, but it is not longer symmetrical as the [neighboring building] had the last roof window on the right
But I wasn't thinking of Grand Hotel
I was more thinking of buildings such as this: [Before] [After] :(
Aw, shucks
Oh, god
Yes, that one needs to be fixed
Here is a similar one from Bergen
[Before] [After]
For Queen Elizabeth II to match King Louis XIV's reign, she must neither die nor abdicate until May 16th 2024
On that day, she will be 98 years and 26 days old
EDIT: [**Click this link to be reminded on May 16th 2024**]
Why did Haiti change theirs, though
Their white rectangle with an emblem is one of the worst features I've seen on a flag
It was well deserved
He gained the nickname after the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 where he was victorious against the Bulgars
He captured 15000 men, and blinded 99 out of every 100 captives, letting the last man lead the remaining 99 home
The trick is to start your reign as early as possible
Louis started his reign at the age of 4 and a half years
He didn't get older than 76, so Elizabeth has him beat in total longevity

The polish are scared of the 3rd german crusade
We all are scared of the shit in Germany
Don’t forget it was the 3rd reich for a moment
All those years and training just to get out of the USSR for a few hours
That’s true dedication right there
One of them, Vladimir Komarov, was killed at the end of his second mission when the parachutes that should have slowed his capsule down failed to deploy and he slammed into the Earth at an unsurvivable speed
A couple of the others are still alive; the rest died of non-space flight related causes
I know the Lost Cosmonaut stories are popular, but there is simply no evidence that any of them ever happened
The US and the Soviet Union were spying on each other so extensively that it would have been impossible for a disastrous space mission to completely escape notice
Liberate HK, Belarus and Thailand

Land of the Free, my ass
Since there are stats on [all of Europe] I see no reason to only do EU
I wonder who number 1 is ;)
The only good part of Scandinavia is west of Sweden and north of Denmark
Just the EU huh
Ok, I see
wonder who's number one in the world just saying
I don’t get these maps that only include the EU and not Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and the UK for example when the statistics used are from the whole world and would be easy to put there
I would understand if it was from a study done by the EU, or some statistic about the EU, but I literally don’t see the point of making a map of the EU and not just all of Europe
Oooohh, it's the EU of course, wondered why Norway wasn't there
[Suck it, Sweden
Celebrating second place
*laughs in Norwegian*
Maybe time to make it official
Land of the "free my ass".
Don't we usually beat just about everyone on all of these stats anyway
Only thing Finland has is that you beat us the Hapiness Index (still kinda salty ngl)
I'm sorry
Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands - It's like they are bribing all "best in world"-rankers
Don't forget that the Finns are usually better educated as well
That's a very good point
Let's just all agree to laugh at Sweden
gotta spend that oil money somehow
Yes, it falls under self-censorship
turkey is one of the worlds worst when it comes to press freedom
i think they have the highest amount of imprisoned journalists
[actually, here is a source]
It affects press freedom and the free flow of ideas if certain ideas will lead to harassment, loss off  advertisers and publishers
Self-sensorship is the effect of the violation, not the violation itself
Note that self-censorship is unenforced sensorship, it can simply 'not happen' but happens nonetheless
Did a medium ever solve a murder case
Never heard of any

This numbers are highly subject to change though, as these are considering the temporary restrictions because of COVID
Most of these top countries, that only have \~ 130 now, had 170-180 just 2 years ago
&#x200B;
In a year or two these numbers will dramatically change, so take it with a grain of salt
Yeah, but you underestimate the power of a nordic passport in the nordics
Like, you don't have to apply for immigration
You just move, and in a few years, you claim citizenship
You tell the state and it just happens
It's not necessarily one specific country
&#x200B;
So Finland might (as an example) have access to Pakistan, wheras Germans have access to Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
So here, Finnish people can still go to a country Germans can't. Germans just have the most overall
&#x200B;
I'm a dual citizen for example, and while my Norwegian passport gives me Visa free access to more than 2x as many countries as my South African passport, Norwegians need a visa to visit Russia, whereas South Africans don't. So even though my South African Passport is far worse, I can still get into places that my Norwegian Passport can't.
Why do you hurt us like this Hellas, I thought we were friends
I think theoretically the two most powerful would be a Western / Northern European passport and a passport from the UAE (which gets you visa free access to China, Russia, and most middle Eastern states
I think that gets you up to around 190 countries visa free
Although that combination is technically impossible since the UAE doesn't allow any form of dual citizenship
Im curious as to where that comes from and how is greece called in greek
Yeah, although with a lot of those combinations, you need to check dual nationality
So while that is technically the best combination, the UAE doesn't allow Dual citizenship under any circumstance
So it is impossible to actually have that combination
Oh okay
So we use the correct name
How come english uses greece
Faen
Oh i see
Thank you
Damn I didn't know this
Definitely glad we didnt settle for grekenland
Not as bad but probably just cause im used to it
I think we sometimes tend to forget the achievements of the Soviet army during WW2
They were also the ones to liberate north of Norway

The ability of some people to view the EU as some kind of benevolent creature never seize to amaze me
No, the EU is not santa claus
The EU's only role is to work for the interests of their member states by creating an inner market and an outer market
At the expense of everyone else
In the words of G.W. Bush, "You are either with us, or against us
Nah, Santa is **not** from Finland, he's a stateless refugee from the North Pole
You're welcome
Always a pleasure
Nah, he's grandfathered in as a Greek :)
Because there's almost nothing Christian about Finland
:) Santa is rooted in ancient European traditions and religious beliefs
There's no historical precedence for Finland
Heck, Turkey and the Netherlands have more claim to him
Greenland and the North Pole are acceptable to me
It's co-opting something that's central to our shared cultures purely for financial motives
It's a bit like making a "Jesus village" in Beijing
He sure didn't come from there and it doesn't fit the narrative
I wonder if there's something to the claim that there was an agreement that no Nordic nation would claim Santa for themselves, but that may be just a legend
It is *protecting Ireland
* There's no "bullying

That the average age is above 30 is rather interesting, but probably says something about unemployment rate and cost of renting/buying a home
Ah, Norway, the non European country in Europe
The Median was about 19 in Norway according to a [2009 SSB article
Doubt the numbers are far off from today, but the article mentioned that the trend is that the median is increasing slightly
As a norwegian i can confirm we never leave our homes
None of these maps over 'Europeans' cover Norway
I'm starting to feel left out :(
I see Norway is missing again
Its reason enough to join the EU just so we would stop being excluded from these maps
Norway's youth moves out at 19
3 years old
Source:
Me, and most of my friends moved out when we were 16 (Started high-school) Didnt know people lived at home for this long
I guess we just moved out very early then
Which language is this
I moved out at around 20 but now when I'm 40 my mom moved in with me due to health troubles
oh how the turntables
I moved out when i was 16, norwegian
And the rich, and the politicians, wants to bring in tons of new people, because Europe "needs labor-force" and "we can afford it
I left home when I was 15 (the year I turn 16) - Anyone living in areas that don't have high schools close enough to home will have their kid leave home at that point
This will drive the average down a lot
I expect the median time is closer to 19 for University

Norway is not in the EU, so no stats for that
- Finland yes
I don't know why it differs
But they differ in a lot of ways
Sweden is almost 1:1 between men and women, but in Finland, men have several years more at home
The source of this is most likely from [here] However, I can't find anything newer than in 2015
And yeah, would like to see Norway vs Sweden, as it should be fairly similar
Denmark is, but a smaller country, so less chance of leaving the house for highschool

As for Norway, being relocated to Croatia now that the oil is gone seems like a win
Montenegro and Kosovo: right, just scoot over
Tfw Moldova, Kosovo, Czechia, Austria, Serbia, Belarus and N. Macedonia still cannot into sea
At least they still don't have to pay for navies
As far as I can tell there's one very long chain that goes through all the countries, with the exception of two three-cycles:
San Marino -> Monaco -> Liechtenstein
Czechia -> Belarus -> Serbia
and of course France, Russia and the Vatican City being stationary
the heat might be alittle much, but i won’t say no to a nice adriatic beach
So we get more sun which would be nice

Norway so small it just disappeared

True
So there are lots of undercover cops in Brazil as well

Does anyone have names for these "layers" in various languages
In norwegian they are called [blåne] and included in the fairy-tale evoking saying "bak den syvende blåne", i.e behind the seventh blue mountain countour (there is said to be something magical, something from a fairy tale, because it's really far away)
Let me introduce you to induction ovens
Far more responsive and accurate than even gas and far safer
And it heats the pan faster than gas
So fast you have to be careful not to set it to max right away to avoid deforming the pans
Pans only deform if you heat them to max to fast
Cast iron is really the best thing to use on induction
The only pans that don't work are old aluminium pans and post with a copper inlay
Bsdicslly really old and really cheap pots
They're far easier to clean than gas at any rate and the same as ceramic
Easier since there's no direct heat
As for wet fingers, that a very low issue
And generally i never ha a problem
There's also non touch controlled tops
That's awesome
Keep the fight going
I saw a interactive map where you could raise or sink the sea level by X meters

She has lead the country for almost 12 years now, but she was also in the government between 1990-1998
That's almost 20 years in total
Technically, it's even longer, because she used to be in government before becoming chancellor
She was first elected to parliament in 1990 and was immediately appointed to the cabinet by her mentor and eventual predecessor
She's served in government since 1990-1998 and then from 2005-2017
That's almost 20 years and counting
She's served 27 years in parliament

Kattegat
The sea between Denmark and Sweden
My great-grandfather (or great-great-grandfather) was from a farm in a fjord where it was even steeper to get up than this
There was only a footpath leading up to it from the fjord below, and they tied ropes around the waists of the children when they went outside to play
I have no clue why they'd ever want to live there
It's filmed in that part of Norway, but the name "Kattegat" is used
In reality Kattegat is not anywhere near
Yes you can, he was driving for a company which was part of a construction project in Lysebotn
He told me it was hell and he even got stuck one time
Sure, it probably had its merits
I reckon living on a farm in the mountainside was better for production, as it had sun for more of the day/year than the ones in the bottom of the valley
The same to you, have a great week

Meanwhile r/communism lament how Estonia doesn't appreciate what "great things" the USSR did for them, asking "why are the baltics so bigoted towards communism" in their crosspost to here
You can't make this shit up
You're right
Half the comments are collapsed, not because of low ratings, but because right wing Americans who've never visited this sub before are flocking to this thread
The absence of the state doesn't really seem feasible, but rather so ideologically utopian it should be recognized as impossible
That response is so ridiculous it would be hilarious if the sub wasn't so big
It's hardly surprising though, as those people have already conjured fascism in everyone as it is the only way to justify the atrocities of the USSR
Yet Stalin is held in incredibly high regard still, and there is little will to acknowledge any wrongdoing in Eastern Europe
Sure, but these collapsed comments are a new reddit meassure to combat brigading
Lots of collapsed comments = lots of people who've never posted in r/europe before
There will always be hierarchy
How do you maintain that absence of classes
What if I live in a communist state and want more than my neighbor, or want democracy, or want hierarchy
Either you allow it, which will very quickly erode and upturn the ideology and leave you with a non-communist country, or you don't allow it, and you've arrived at totalitarianism
Cooperation between a group of countries is far more realistic than the complete selfless cooperation of almost every individual required for statelessness in my opinion
Also, society cannot work without organization, is this organization really much different than the state
What makes the state evil besides hierarchy which cannot disappear
Is it that horrible that Estonia makes a museum relevant for Estonia
How is a state inherently oppressive and represent class rule
I am of the perspective that a worker or farmer have good opportunities in my country for joining a political party to gain a platform for their views, which if popular will earn them the position of prime minister
I experience the state to be subservient to the people, thus the state is our tool for organization, not an oppressor
Alright, but then calling for the abolishment of hierarchy is not what is being done
There must be organization, and organization inherently requires hierarchy
Yeah, I'm rather arguing against the idea than you
Others are free to join the discussion
How would that form of governance diverge meaningfully from the current Finnish state
Is the power not in the hands of the people through the almost completely uncorrupted democracy
Can't a farmer or worker easily join a party and become prime minister
That seems to be the case here
Local communities have made agreements to form larger communities which is organized together as a state
If the only difference is more local autonomy then that is already advocated by parties within the parliamentary system
Edit: I don't find it too surprising that anarchism or communism is attractive in e.g. the US or Russia, but in countries like Finland where the state is largely subservient to the people, as it should be, I find it particularly strange to advocate for radical measures
The whole motivation for dismantling the state is that no individual should be required to follow any rule not agreed upon by themself
How does that view not come with the expectation of near fanatic altruism as you mentioned described by Marx
I do not agree theft should be illegal thus I may steal your pet if I am the stronger party
I did not intend to imply that Marx argued for it, merely that it was that sort of altruism he described, seemed like a requirement for communism to even remotely work without the totalitarian approach of past regimes
If self defence is the only thing stopping acts of aggression then the strong will form a new hierarchy praying on the weak
Complete individual freedom must be restrained somehow to avoid such aggression, whether by a state or by expectation of self defence, the latter being unavailable to many
If groups affiliate to serve as defence for those unable to defend themself, conflict arise between groups and the stronger establish hierarchy
Complete, unrestrained individual freedom *is* the dismantling of society
As long as the state remains subservient to the electorate you will have the same result, only that it is the majority rather than the strong who impose rules, which is most favourable to the most people, being the majority
Reminds me of a Polish hospital room I saw in 1994 (where my Norwegian friend had to spend 4 hours with a dead guy (one of his 2 rooms mates died, but was left there for a few hours before picking up the body)
But I believe hospitals have improved in Poland since then
And I hope the care in Romania is better than the room
Wow
The fact that shit is still this bad in parts of Europe is kinda depressing
It's like we live in two completely different worlds
Kids this is why being near the USSR was the best
Good to hear that they have renovated some of it
Things will improve once all of it is done
Your environment does affect you (as a photo of a Norwegian prison somewhere in this thread might be evidence of)

[No Elks in Europe] but we call Moose; Elg/Älg/Hirvi(???) which is confusing
Pretty sure there are way more moose in Europe than in North America
Never admit that we find ourselves confusing to the Americans
You make a valid point =P
So what
Yes
you are unique
My man
No, we blame the americans with their silly moose naming
Yeah, the reindeer are drawn to roads because there is often a draft there that keeps insects away, and there are a lot of insects in Lapland in the summer
Carry on then
Aaaaw
You came back to admit it when you found out
So nice of you =D
Just in case there's ambiguity in my message, it is NOT sarcasm
I actually thought it was nice =D
Did I say that
Although, after discussions following my comment, it seems that Norway may only have more lakes because of a more lenient definition
Repost from r/brasil
What the fuck are Communist memes doing in this sub
Especially when this shit doesn't apply to us(paying outrages sums for tests)
Does it even apply to Americans
What a fucking shitshow this sub and its redditors have become
What are the fucking mods doing
This has no relevance to Europe
Its 90% propaganda lately
Edit: Also, you are preaching to the wrong crowd here commies, unlike Americans plenty of (Eastern)Europeans have experience with Communism and do not see it in the same kind light as you do
Imagine being Western European, never having suffered through Communism like Poland and Lithuania, then not listening as these people are telling you socialism is a bad idea
Its not like they would know with their literal experience lol right
Is iodine deficiency a big problem in South Holland
I trust a Pole and Lithuanian with their experiences over a fucking Dutchie any fucking day
Stick to ice-skating and tulips
if that’s what they want, then surely they wouldn’t be doing their job

Wow, Norway surprises me

It helps when you are outside their gene pool
latinos are america specific, romanesque is probably a better term
not [really]
if you could provide a source because i can’t find any who calls anyone not from america latino
in their own language is a different case, but you reffered to them as latinos in english
it’s not a race or culture, correct, but it’s a term in english that refers to people form the latin speaking parts of america, usually south and central america
personally, i wouldn’t call anyone not from latin america a latino
anyone from france, italy or spain are french, italians or spanish
if i had to use a umbrella term i would use southern european
the ony exception would be if a french person was from french guiana, but again i would probably just call the french still

No worries, Norway as the superior Scandinavian country is represented
I hate this time of year
Cold in the morning so I wear warm clothes and it rises to god damn 15 degrees during the day
I'm melting
On the other hand, it's funny to see the guys who don't give a shit and wear t-shirts and shorts during the 5 degrees period in the morning
On Saturday it even reached 16 degrees
Yeah we had like 18°C here I live in Norway yesterday
Infuckingsane
9 degrees in Oslo
It is like hell here
Please help
I saw 18 degrees C on snapchat today, it was insane
Sudden spring, on friday, all the roads were covered in snow or slush, now they're all bare and the snow levels have noticeably gone down after a weekend of +5C and sun
Got to drive up beer and canned food to the cabin for the summer now before the snow is gone, usually you can still drive snowmobiles above the tree line in mid-may, but now I'm not so sure
That was two weeks ago
It doesn't smell like Shit anymore here
Yaaay
I'd rather be a bit cold in the morning than dying of heat stroke the rest of the day
Literally sitting at a train station outside in shorts and a t-shirt reading this
You dont laught at my zip-off pants now
Actually why we're surviving economically
We have less than half a year to spend money living, the rest of the year we hibernate
[And it's soon time to start cooking outdoors again
It comes in pints
I'm getting one[!]
Wait, you ordered alcohol
The thing with Melbourne is that all the houses are built as if there is no winter
10C in April feels like a heat wave
10C in july I'm freezing my ass off
All about expectations
No, you still can't into Nordic
Stop asking, we've gone over this before
Jeg mener jeg leste på yr at Sørlandet kom til å flomme over om vi fikk tidlig sommer i år.
It’s 50°F.
0°C is when water freezes
Well it does now, frost is out of the ground and farmers are spraying shit all over the fields
Ahh, the smell of spring
Can't drink on the street anywhere in ~~Scandinavia~~ the Nordic countries, it's just that they don't enforce it in certain areas since the law was meant for public nuisance and not chilling in the ~~purk~~ park
Edit: it was early, no coffee
I started the magical "smoke-out-the-neighbours"-season on saturday by burning the grill clean and making some skewers
During the snowstorms you sit on the porch with an ice cream cone and wait for it to refill
Because we like to joke around
People here love warm weather and everyone is outside when it's nice and warm outside
Also after spending a week or so in a hotter climate you get used to it
Er ikke det hvert år da
I hear the voctorians are building a new tunnel from london, the Emu express they call it
The sleeper cab is probably worth it
I would make a case for 18C being ideal night temperature
And since bedroom temperature cannot be lower than outdoor temperature, 18C is where I draw the line
Unfortunately I'm so picky about it anything below is too cold and anything above is too hot
What do you think i'm wearing
Ah but you see, -10C to +10C is the worst temperature area
Well that and -30C and lower, as well as +30C and higher
Well we sometimes use an oven mitten, but that's to protect from the heat
Barbecues get pretty hot you know
Main issue is that it need to be warm enough to comfortably sit down and eat outside without bulky clothes
Also the food tend to get cold pretty quick after serving so best to stick with quick "finger food" or stuff that is just as good when served cold
Mittens
Well
in 10°C I'd still use that to prevent my hand from getting fried by the barbeque, not to keep it warm from the really nice weather
Now if you'd ask what I/we do when it's -10°C (yes I have fired up the barbeque in -10 - it's great, if a bit slow to get going), then we might be on to something here
I barbecued on saturday in 12C, AMA
I was going to, but there was still half a meter of snow where the barbecue usually stays
Maybe next weekend
Nonono, don't give me that bullshit, *where can you order alcohol
No it’s ok
It’s not your fault your country keeps using backwards measuring systems (:
Did you actually barbecue or just burn a pack of sausages then drench them in ketchup to hide the taste of ash
Fun fact: only one country separates Norway and North Korea
Think about that
Shit
True, but that feels like a waste
Barbecue and outdoors eating are just linked in my mind
My parents had a big concrete fireplace/barbecue area in the garden with a seating area that's half walled in, so we'd be out there even if the weather was not super nice
Theres a difference
Seriously though I made some japanese style chicken skewers that were perfectly seasoned by the burnt remains of of last years food
Never thought about that
It's not that far away though
By area, France is the third largest in Europe with ~550,000 sqkm, and Sweden is 5th with ~450,000 sqkm
In the case of Sweden, forest

It seems the ECDC does collect data for EU/EEA:
>  but deaths are thankfully going down with each day
That site does not say that
In fact, it's saying that deaths are probably heading up slightly once you adjust for deaths that have happened but haven't been reported yet (the pale grey bars in the top chart)
That may well be
All I take issue with is using a site that shows the opposite of what the person I responded to claimed
The site might be *wrong* about that, but it's like using a link showing that # of known cases is going up as proof infection is going down

Russia has 110
Not my experience from their dash cams but
I want my Norwegian highway to have 135 on a single highway just to be better than Sweden
Yeah it's not much
But no child died in traffic here in 2019
So there is that
Norway only has about 500 meters of road that you can safely do 110 on
Most places you'll be doing 50-80
If you notice the vodka is wearing off you're allowed to drive faster in order to do a refill
Nice
Can you make a map of the *actual* speed people drive
No, that's just the general speed limit outside of built-up areas, we have highways with higher standards that also has a higher speedlimit
As the title of thread says "maximum speed limit".
That's just the standard speedlimit for highways I think, there is some roads with 120

Fun fact, it's only in the Scandinavian countries we talk about "bayer" as a beer type
People from Bayern/Bavaria haven't heard of it, like /u/zamazigh points out
They might know the style under the name of a Münchner Dunkel
Norwegian: Øl, olje
Which is extremely funny for Norwegians
In Norwegian, the similarly sounding word “bæsj” means poop
It's short for pilsner, a type of beer that was invented in Pilsen in the chech republic
Yes
We use y or i as vocals, j is rarely used in the middle of words unless in "tj", "kj", "sj" or "skj". We say "høy/høyere", "bøye", "fornøyelsespark", etc

I am confident that our Nordic black sheep will return to us again at some point
But we have to be patient and let them make their own mistakes
That's how they can grow
Between the Nordic countries the Nordic Passport Union has granted free movement since 1954
Because of the Schengen Treaty, this distinction is not readily apparent, but it is still there

I think the only big mistake made was not preventing the public visiting old age homes at the same time Denmark and Norway did so
But there were so many unknowns back then
Norway's prime minister has admitted that maybe it was not necessary to close all schools
I feel kind of sorry for all politicians through this
It's not easy to be on top and having to make really difficult decisions
Hopefully things have normalised all over Europe by the summer of 2021
(Edit: spelling)
Well
even tho we appreciate togetherness, being assfucked is another matter
It's not our fault that the Danish people was too lazy to bother keeping it's empire together
*"Denmark, mom says its our turn to rule the union
No, I thought those big lights needed more power
I think closing the schools did not affect the spread of the disease *directly*. But it sure made a lot of people realize that yes, this is serious
It's not the only mistake, there are more people dead outside institutions in Sweden than the rest of the Nordics combined
Schools might have opened a little earlier, but better safe than Sweden
Suppose that Iceland and Norway were opposed to open borders to the EU/Schengen area
Then the other Nordic countries would have to choose
Ireland chose to keep the open borders with the UK
The Faroe Islands has open borders with the other Nordic countries, but they are not in the Schengen Area
When I left the Faroe Islands as a Nordic citizen to go to Copenhagen, there was touch screen on the boarding pass turnstile before the security check asking for citizenship
Those who chose something non-Nordic were pulled aside and had their passports checked
Going from Copenhagen to the Faroe Islands on the other hand, required no checks at all
It might be different if you travel from a non-Nordic country to the Faroe Islands, though
I think you are right
That is in fact the point when people really started taking everything seriously
Maybe not, but there is a medical precident for it
Sometimes kids can carry/be unnafected by a disease but still spread it
And we really knew very little about the virus in the begining
We even pronounce it in a way that makes sense

No sign of spring in Northern Norway
On this day there are several snow records broken
This is from E69 to North Cape
Yeah, it's been like that here, too (close to Trondheim) Nice weather, finally spring, boom, snow for like 2 days straight, repeat
Thank goodness I live on the southern coast
Wait, we have a E69 in Norway
Nice
I don’t want to know what the summer will be like
Might as well fix the basement and move down there before it’s too late
and if you come to my city in Norway
the whole place is cold and rainy
just the average Norwegian summer nothing unusual
No sign of spring
It was literally 18 degrees yesterday and I haven't closed my windows since
Yes, what are you going to do about it
They also have far to large herds of reindeers
A lot of them have gotten orders to slaughter large parts of their herds because they are far above the quotas set
Compounded by the overproduction of reindeer meat that they can’t sell
There was actually a reportage about this on the news a couple of days ago
They're basically flying 250 tons of food out into the wilderness with helicopters
Source: [NRK]
It's extremely hot there too
It's just not hot enough to melt the snow enough before the next snowfall
I live in this area, and it's like 10 degrees outside
17C in Oslo
Norway is looong
It's all fun and games until you have to remove all of it from your driveway
They are, but this is an abnormal amount of snow
Barely
Same in Oslo
Norway is looong
I think some Norwegians up north would happily pay you too take some of the snowfall if that was possible
Saw a guy on the news yesterday, and he was so sick and tired haha
"Spring"
We only have summer and winter
Always two there are
Maybe not
The reindeer don’t graze in places like these
They graze on the wind swept plains
I haven’t heard anything about reindeer starvation this year, and trust me
We hear about it when reindeer starve
Its 6 degrees and sunny here and people are waking around in t-shirts
After winter, everything feels hot
I'm North of Alaska
And we are also thought climate science in school here
We know
Also, it's not a lot of snow in Norway
Only in Northern Norway
That’s their claim every year
When it’s really bad mattilsynet are the ones who makes the news about the bad conditions
They do that every year
Primarily from them having much to large herds and not keeping them in the right areas
I’ll consider it an actual emergency when mattilsynet says it is
They’re the ones who monitors that
Mattilsynet is the one that decides
And they provide this “emergency” help every year
And are now forcing several reindeer owners to slaughter hundreds of reindeer to prevent these emergencies every year and come down to their allowed quotas
Look at news for every year back in time, make sure to cover local news for everywhere there’s a reinbeitedistrikt
Seeing as you’re in Germany i doubt you have ever lived in a place with a reinbetedistrikt, I have lived in several of them
Them getting emergency help is as sure every year as sheep farmers claiming hundreds of their “best” sheep were taken by wolfs every year
Either way, only one agency decides if there’s a emergency and covers help for them and that is mattilsynet
They are the official agency for this, not the owners
Reinbetedistrikt aren’t just in the north
Ask mattilsynet if you don’t believe yearly news reports
I don’t think mattilsynet really releases those numbers specifically though
If they actually operated according to traditional methods and here sizes they would herd the flicks to places with easier to get food like in the past
These big herds eat to much though for traditional methods and strip the easy to access areas and in winters like these they are then facing disaster because they can’t get to food in the snow rich areas
It all comes back to modern industrialized production and over sized herds
Yet another anecdote
A single starving moose
because that doesn’t happen every winter or anything
All I’m saying is that if you haven’t seen news about starving reindeer and their owners asking for help in local and sometimes national news every year the last 10-20 years you haven’t been paying attention or you’re actively ignoring it
Yeah sure it’s bad this year
But at some point yelling wolf will bite them back , especially when they willfully break the laws by having twice as many animals as they’re allowed
And you can claim this isn’t what causing this years issue
But having twice as many animals eating is going to cause issues twice as fast especially when they have to move in from the areas with easily accessible food because the herd that’s to big ate it all
You’re ignoring all these arguments to focus on straw men you build so you don’t need to defend why they keep breaking these laws and why big herds is an issue that also aggravates food issues cause by environmental issues
We tried outlawing it here in Norway, but disturbingly most politicians were in favor of mgm
Lol this made me remember when i was in Barcelona with class and we were tasked with finding out to what degree Catalonia was independent/ self governing
So I asked a security guard outside a museum or something and he proceeded to rant about how Spaniards are lazy and that Madrid takes money out of Catalonia

Were the young turks really any better

I'm impressed with the Netherlands
I expected more of them to live in apartments
The UK and Ireland also have massive housing crises
Isn't it boring to live without a garden, garage, fireplace and so on
It’s called the Aral sea
Russia moved it westward, didn’t you hear
The bigger problem is that people use the property market as an investment
I guess some people rather want to live like ants in a hamster wheel than being free
In my country, Norway, freedom and independence is a very important value, according to the European Social Survey
So I guess this has a lot to do with culture, values and so on
Even in the cities here most people live in houses
If people live in apartments, it's often because of necessity (in the cities they are cheaper to buy than houses), but when they get kids most of them move into suburban areas
And who decides the laws
The population (through democracy)
pack my bags
Imagine if Iceland was an EU member they could actually send *the* Mountain as their champion
We'll send Tormund

Holy fucking Shit that title Dude
I'm from way up north, and I don't know this situation good enough to really take a stand
But I feel like they (Spanish and Catalan gov) kinda play the game of one-up each other here, I'm not sure if that's the best approach, especially if you want to keep it at least kinda peacefully
Another thing, isn't Catalonia kinda split in the middle when it comes to independence
I think that number should be way higher before you do something like this (maybe 75-80% at least)
You don't want your new claimed state to rip it self apart as well as a the fight with the old country, right
As I said, I don't know shit, so this is more like questions, not a comment
I wish all the best for the Catalan people
Their right to decide their own future is what democracy is
I hope this is the right decision in the long run
Let's hope spain doesn't handle this like they handled the referendum
Some representatives left the building in protest
I know that, I've somewhat followed it the last couple of weeks/months, but I'm in no way qualified to take a stand

6th question following the no's on the far left
That is a very interesting spelling of alphabet
Just goes to show the Finnish like to have some extra letters they do not use haha
Same reason the letters w, x, q, z and c are in the Norwegian/Danish/Swedish ones
Because loan words
If you say yes on "Ö" you end up with Estonian, not German
You sense of humour is so dry I expected you to be Finnish
To my surprise you are not

Nah, tuborg is actually good in Denmark since they use better water there
Better water in denmark
Wut
Yeah definitely boring, it's practically a standard unit
It's common for beer brands to use tap water in their original city, but distilled water at other breweries
This is because the minerals in the water affect the taste
So Tuborg is better in Denmark because they use undistilled water
Yeah, but they rarely manage to get it the same as the original

We should stop doing that and just spend some extra money getting rid of our own garbage in a more environmentally friendly manner

What a shitshow that was
Absolutely horrendous
Two students from my school fell victim there
"When one man can show so much hate, imagine how much love we all can show together" -Helle Gannestad, a member of the youth organization which was attacked on 22
Of July
I live in the place where Utøya is, and I even visited it two years ago due to school
It was very eerie and difficult to go there
It was so quiet, and no one seemed to be able to talk to each other
On the island, we visited a cafe building where people had been shot and killed
You could see the many bullet holes, and it’s one of the things I can never forget
Especially the pictures of the victims that had been killed there
Our guide told us how some families have “spots” on the island where their beloved one was killed
It’s where the families go to grieve
We also went to a museum-like place where you could read the text messages between the victims and families
It was so heartbreaking reading the last texts between a parent and their child
I can say that I did not come out of that memorial with dry eyes
Another thing that also struck me hard, was that a girl who had been on the island when it happened (she was 11 years old), and unfortunately lost her mother, worked in a cafe on Utøya
We went to the same school and she used to be my classmate
She’s such a sweet and lovely girl, and my heart bleeds for her when I think about what her family must’ve been through
To this day, 22
July is still a very sore subject to talk about
At least for us locals who live near Utøya
I had a cousin who was on Utøya
I remember sitting there watching the NEWS in complete silence with my family not knowing whether he was alive or not, my aunt and uncle started driving down to Oslo and gave us updates underways
We didn't know if he was still alive until after the police had made it to the island
We went to my grandparents to help calm them down
Not until around 19:00 did we get the message that he was alive
Words cannot describe the absolute terror we felt
The sorrows we as a nation felt
But also the love and community felt afterwards
This pisses me the fuck off
77 people were *murdered* in cold blood by an absolute fucktard of a human being
It took less than 10 years for Netflix to make a documentary about it
I know this is an European sub, but if someone did that with 9/11 there'd be protests and a bunch of bullshit, meanwhile this *terrorist* attack is not even being shown as what it actually is, a little bitch of a shitstain that murdered 77 people, and would have murdered an entire political party "camp" targeted at *youth*.
That day was so surreal
First a massive explosion down town
The main building at the governmental quarter was the target
Killing eight people instantaneously and making the whole country direct our focus, and more importantly, our police and medical resources to what seemed like 9/11 terror attack
At this point the country knew little to nothing about the situation
Even NRK (The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) published articles speculating that this was the work of terror organization "Al Qaida" (ref:
It wasn't until approximately an hour later that it was declared that this was but a distraction
I remember that 7 year old me was at a circus having fun while it happened
It feels surreal to associate such a happy memory with such an awful incident
I was only 10 years old when it happened and I remember it clearly
I’ll never forget that day
We were not in the country when it happened, so seeing my own country being attacked like that and watching the TV the whole day and not knowing what was gonna happen next was horrible
It was weird to come home again
I also made a Facebook group after it happened about hating on Breivik
Not sure what happened to it
Now that I think of it, my grammar wasn’t very good back then
I remember waking up that Saturday morning - having already struggled to fall asleep - turning on my phone and seeing "92 people killed\*" blaring at me
It was so bizzare and unreal I think my brain struggled to comprehend it
I hugged my two kids extra that day
&#x200B;
(\*the initial reports during the night was 85 killed at Utøya and 7 in Oslo
This was later revised downwards to the 69+8 number)
21 years is the maximum penalty given here in Norway
But this is a very special case
So the thing is that he's jailed for 21 years, but he's under surveillance 24/7, and even tho he's jailed for 21 years, he will most likely never make it out to society
Doctors/psychiatrist has to make that decision
If they cannot "rehabilitate" him, he will most likely stay jailed for the rest of his life
He got what we called 21 years forvaring (preventive detention)
From [Wikipedia]
>The indeterminate penalty (civilian penal code), called "preventive detention" (Norwegian: forvaring), is set at up to 21 years' imprisonment, with no eligibility for parole for a time period not exceeding 10 years
If the prisoner is still considered dangerous after serving the original sentence, the detention can be extended by five years at a time
Renewal of the detention every five years can in theory result in actual life imprisonment
Preventive detention is used when the prisoner is deemed a danger to society and there is a great chance of them committing violent crimes in the future
[2] However, after the minimum time period has elapsed, the offender can petition for parole once every year, and this may be granted if it is determined that they are no longer a danger to society
TL,DR: He'll never be released
Breivik is not likely to be let out at 53, as he was sentenced to 21 years with what I think is called Special Detention in English
In practice, that means that he will remain in prison as long as they still deem him a danger to society
As for his cell, Norwegian prisons generally focus on rehabilitation over punishment
which applies to all prisoners, including the ones we like the least
That's the way it should be everywhere, as far as I'm concerned
Now you're just spreading misinformation
He's not free to leave after his sentence of 21 years
He will potentially be in prison for the rest of his life
The sentence can and most likely will be extended every five years until he's dead
Treating criminals like animals and torturing them has not served anyone well
It's not even good for the people working in the prisons
I won't go into detail
Prison is not about cruel punishment, it's loss of freedom only
Our laws prevent cruel and unusual punishment, as we've done that in the past
It does not lead anywhere good
The law is absolutely **not** on the side of anyone that chooses to kill Breivik after he is "released" (unlikely)
You are clearly not well informed
He got Forvaring, which means after his sentence is over there will be a panel every five years
The panel will then decide whether or not he is still a threat to society
Which they probably will decide until Fjotten is dead
Same here
I was 10 when it happened, and I remember watching it live and seeing my family staring watching the news as Oslo and Utøya happened live, but I never really understood what was happening
My young mind thought it was war in Norway, but I didn't really understand until later what the attacks was about
Yes, but the system really isn't designed with people like him in mind
Even so he technically can get released
His base sentence run out after 21 years
After that there will be a review every 5 years
If at some point after that the review find that he is rehabilitated and no longer pose a threat to anyone he would get released
Seem like a very unlikely scenario at the moment considering his total lack of remorse, but who knows what happens 30+ years down the line
It really isn't about rehabilitation in this case
It's about preserving our own justice system and sense of self
We didn't change our society or justice system
We had our laws in place, and we respected the victims, by treating the offender like the criminal he is
He is nothing special and justice was served
Not everyone understands or likes it, but everyone can agree that the law was followed
>The panel will then decide whether or not he is still a threat to society
What I find challenging: what if he is no longer deemed a threat to society
What if he does a heel-turn in prison and starts rejecting his previously held beliefs and ideas and instead deeply regrets what he did
"Dom på forlengelse innebærer at det fortsatt vurderes å være fare for gjentakelse av alvorlige straffbare handlinger
" ([
I remember vividly the talks during the trial and how it was concluded "he will never get out", but .. to my knowledge we cannot keep him imprisoned based on the severity of the crime alone
Some of his victims, who lived, will only be in their 30's and 40's when his sentence is up
Purpose
He is a living embodiment of our respect for human rights, justice, rule of law and due process
Do you see how that doesn't mean he's the one benefiting
It's our society we're respecting and protecting
We didn't change our way of life due to that attack on it
Hypocritical
No, the justice system is there for everyone, regardless of his crimes
His lack of respect for human rights doesn't mean we should do the same(!) We honor his victims by respecting the very system they wanted to preserve and improve
He may have legitimate claims of mistreatment, it's *not* unlikely due to his crimes, so he should absolutely have the right to make his case and be heard
That doesn't mean he should win his cases, that is a completely different matter
You are completely wrong in assuming they're "dangerous animals". They're humans and you could end up in prison yourself by accident
Many of them are simply damaged (abuse) or mentally ill, or even retarded
Socio-economic conditions often leads to crimes (poverty)
Those who kill are often related to their victims (family)
People make huge mistakes as well (robberies gone bad, drunken crimes, etc)
Treat humans as animals and you get the same in response
American jails prove the point, they're training camps for violent offenders
Not everyone can be saved or is safe to release, but you should at least try to preserve your own dignity by not abusing weak and damaged humans
Keep the dangerous criminals in detention, but don't abuse them
&#x200B;
>I don't see his sentence as something that punishes him
Yes, he's not supposed to be punished, the lack of freedom is the punishment
It's quite sufficient
We've long since moved away from retribution, cruel and unusual punishments or torture \[in Europe\]
However, many people have the view that criminals deserve to be hurt badly to "pay" for their crimes; a simple human response to a complicated problem
It doesn't give the victims satisfaction or justice, it doesn't prevent crimes from happening (see passion, economics, for example)
IIRC even the people who drove him on the ferry to the island where weirded out by him
Don't think Norwegians now see him as this suave sociopath who can trick mental health officials
We all know what he really is
No, that's only if all else fails
Paradoxically, letting violent criminals back into society and giving them trust gives the lowest recidivism, and thus less crime
If we fall down to his level, we are no better than he is
We have to be the bigger person
An eye for an eye, and the whole world goes blind
I sometimes wonder if Erdogan intends to eventually leave NATO entirely and keeps pushing boundaries because he no longer values good relations with the West

[Unfortunately, Turkey is still a valuable NATO partner;] that's more or less why we don't blatantly treat it as a geopolitical enemy

That's not random and you know it

Notice how germany grabbed alsace lorraine
This makes much more sense to me, I don’t really get why Norway is Western Europe, Northern Europe makes much more sense
You're lumping us in with the filthy Swedes
They're clearly Eastern Europe
Central and southeastern Europe are terms I think I’ve never heard before
In Norway, people only talk about western, eastern and southern Europe
Where the east-west boundary is the german-polish border
Czechia is a grey zone, but if you asked random people in the streets, would young people probably say west, and old say east (cuz cold war history)
Austria west
Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia east
Spain, Portugal, southern france, Italy south of *arbitrary point*, and Greece would be southern Europe (syden)
Can someone explain the 3 cultures of France
And what makes Estonia more central than northern
Your new empire
> Not sure what this means, but Estonia shares social values with Scandinavia
I agree
I lived in Estonia for 12 months once and visited several times after that, and felt very much at home
The exception was the Estonian Russians - who I found to be very different - although not necessarily in the bad way
They were just a lot more
loud
Native Estonians however I see as very Scandinavian in personality and culture
i think he means geogrsphically they’re not northern europe because they’re not part of the fennoscandinavian peninsula, which all the nordic nations with the exception of iceland and denmark are
and denmark and iceland are still fairly connected the rest
denmark is only seperated by a tiny strait, and has a seriously short border with the rest of the continent
personally i think the baltic states should be their own region, they certainly don’t fit as "central european" when that denomination includes switzerland, poland and **croatia**. either that, or they should be incorporated into eastern europe
i think the baltics have a closer cultural and historical tie to the east than the north
but as i said, i think they should be their own thing
> Germans are weird
In what way
I ask because I'm curious how people in another country view someone in yet another country
>They were just a lot more
loud
So they are like people from Bergen
Yeah but that includes the baltics and parts of Russia too
Looking at this this seems to be more based on culture, language, history and values as all these northern European countries are a part of the Nordic Co-operation
> I suspect your bar for "loud" is set very low:)
Yes you are correct
Unless we are drunk
> Although in my experience yours seems to be much higher that that of the Finns
Correct again
Unless they are drunk
Yes, but we tease them and claim that they say: "I am not from Norway, I'm from Bergen
" I guess it's the way we try to explain that they are a bit different from the rest of us

> Germans dilute apple juice or orange juice with sparkling water
That's heresy
Yummy
> Germans often tend to eat bread for dinner and a warm meal for lunch, whereas we do the other way round
Huh
They never cook dinner at home
> Germans wear bicycle helmets
Does this mean you don't get a fine in Netherlands for not wearing a helmet
> If a sign says you are only allowed to dispose glass on working days between 8:00 - 18:00, you'll be literally frowned upon if you dispose glass outside these hours
so the Dutch don't like following rules very much
Norwegians are kinda unique in the sense that we very rarely eat at restaurants compared to most other European countries
Also, you dilute your apple or orange juice with water
Ugh, det høres ikke godt ut i det hele tatt
Isn't the Estonian õ close to the Scandinavian ø?
> Norwegians are kinda unique in the sense that we very rarely eat at restaurants compared to most other European countries
[72% of Germans eat out less than once a week] so that cant be the answer to eating bread for dinner
:) If that is true

Did he stop for one second and think that perhaps his "shared dreams" are not everyones shared dreams, and that the constant EU drive towards abolishment of state borders and some form of federation lead from continental Europe is what ultimately caused Brexit
Instead of flaming Brits for being "selfish" for not wanting to hang at your house anymore, perhaps try have the introspection to see why
So this guy actually think it is Iceland and Norway (the places that are located north of EU) that have issues with populism on this continent, not his own union
WTF
I think he means that what they're doing is selfish and undermines the efforts of Churchill and all those english men
Effectively he is arguing that it's abandoning the idea of peace and prosperity in Europe for their own selfish gains
[Clear case of penis envy
I just sent a snapchat of the sunny 0C weather here to my colleague who is currently on holiday in Italy
-15 here
And then you have Iceland
Everyone is always claiming Norway is so cold, but just look at the coast
Pretty much a mediterranean climate I tell you
From my experience in the northern part of Norway where it's very cold every year is that the mosquitos grow large as sparrows
Still remember my visit to London some years ago on the 14th of February and lots of spring flowers where blooming
Shocking to be honest
Depends on the humidity
-1 on the coast can feel a lot colder than -5 in the mountains
Luckily it's rarely humid and cold at the same time
Try inhaling through your nose and you'll feel the difference
Your nose hairs don't generally freeze at -5, but at -15 you'll definitely feel it
fuck everything about that
Thank you for posting this, now it feels slightly better that summer is still 3 months away
Tell me about it
I am literally sitting here right now aching all over because of borrelia caused by ticks
I went for a long ski trip with my kids today in -15
They are jumping around, red-cheeked, happier than ever, while I am completely destroyed

Was there a few years ago during a heatwave (38 C), not sure if that was much better

True
You haven't heard of this happening in Finnmark
I'm in the purple area on the map
Summer is still five months away

Yeah, I've lived there
Lovely combo of cold, windy and humid
Not that my current location is much better, but Copenhagen is surprisingly cold if you're just looking at the temperature on the thermometer
Sure, but fuck everything about that too
I grew up right next to the ocean where there are almost no mosquitos
You'd like western Norway, where it can be 10 degrees on any day of the year (and raining)

Princess Victoria looks like that princess from Shrek 2
You know which one I'm talking about
Shouldn’t they all be crown princes or crown princess’? Or is that just a Norwegian thing
The 1814 Constitution requires that the Norwegian monarch ask permission from the Storting before accepting the throne of a foreign nation
Given Norway’s history of being ruled from abroad, the people (and thus the Storting) would never approve of it
“Svensketida” (“The Swedish period”) is not thought fondly of among Norwegians
The legalities aside
who would be the true head of state
Queen Victoria of Sweden, Prince Haakon of Sweden, Queen Victoria of Norway and King Haakon of Norway
Hah
They’re mostly all from the same gene pool, aren’t they
King George II back in the 1700 I believe
The current Queen Elizabeth II is actually the 3rd Queen Elizabeth II
They have backup clones that take her place when the old one dies
They're born into power they don't/can't use, most don't have as much wealth as you think, and there's not a lot of them
Yes, hereditary positions is a remnant of the past, but people inherit money all the time
Lately
It's been going on for a long time
Here in Norway the booth has piles with ballots for each party
You choose your party's ballot, then there's a list of candidates where you can strike the ones you don't like, and upvote the ones you like (and even add candidates from different parties from the one you vote for)
Seems much easier to me than this gigantic
thing
What a magnificent feat of engineering
Two
So you're just plainly admitting to voter fraud
The booths have curtains (sort of like those changing rooms in clothing stores), and you put your ballot in an envelope before putting it into the thing
I assume you need some kind of proof of authorization though, right

Swedes have no say about finnish and we don't think finnish is ugly
Finland is its own country and stands as an equal partner to sweden in the nordic cooperation

Since when does having more cases make a language less crude
Complex and diverse are not the opposite of crude
Refined, elegant, tasteful would be the opposite of crude
I'd hate to think you find caseless languages unrefined, inelegant or untasteful, considering German is well on its way to losing the genitive
>In 2012, Norway and Sweden reached a joint agreement to increase their production of electricity from renewable energy sources by 28
4 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2020
Wait, Norway is, and has been for the past century, 100% hydroelectric
Why does Norway never get the credit when we are literally breaking the tables and producing more clean energy than we use
[1]
Meanwhile, Sweden's arrogant brother in the West(Norway) is and has been at 99% renewable energy for decades
That's right, Norway gets 99% of our energy from renewable(hydropower)
I am not saying this just to annoy Swedes(partly) but also because I wonder exactly what the difference is between Norway and Sweden
Why is Norway able to do 99% but very similar Sweden with even bigger rivers etc
can only do 65%.
Is it our mountains, higher rainfall and glaciers
Most likely that's a part of it I'd say but there has to be something else too
That can't be enough to account for such large differences
We're similar enough that it should be much more equal I think
Is there anyone here who works in hydro in Scandinavia who can answer that question
Wonder if the forest fires put a dent in their carbon emissions
Because of our oil and gas exports
We reached the 2030 goals in 1930, we're just waiting for the rest to catch up :)
On a serious note, hydro electricity tends to be excluded from these goals, as well as nuclear energy, although both are as good as infinite in source
I assume it is because they want to develop new technology, and hydro electricity requires very specific geographic conditions, while e.g. wind turbines can be used almost everywhere
Same reason nobody pats you on the back and commends you for your hard work when your family is rich as fuck and you never really worked that hard at all
I think you need to dig deeper
Norway is the home to one of the largest aluminium companies worldwide, [Norsk Hydro] and [subsidiaries] It has operations in some 50 countries around the world and is active on all continents
The whole reason we started building hydro power in Norway was for this kind of heavy industry
If you drive a BMW, Audi, or Volvo you probably have aluminium parts from Norway (or from a Norwegian company)
[Kongsberg Automotive] provides world-class products to the global vehicle industry
The Kongsberg group makes everything from missiles to aircraft parts
[Elkem] is one of the world's leading suppliers of silicon-based advanced materials with operations throughout the value chain from quartz to specialty silicones, as well as specialty ferrosilicon alloys and carbon materials
The company's 27 production sites are found worldwide, but most are in Norway
No, what's the point in trying to PREVENT bad shit from happening, right
> Sweden has harder geography for renewables - though still favorable ones - and as such it requires more effort to reach a higher share of renewables
You mean like 90% of Scandinavia's biggest rivers
Most of the big rivers start in the Norwegian mountains and go East yet Sweden has failed to take advantage of it despite being richer than Norway until the 80s.
Its not like Sweden doesn't have huge potential reservoirs for hydro-power either, their country has a shitton of long skinny lakes perfect for damming
Still, we have it better geographically and climatically no doubt but by how much
Not enough to account for the huge difference in renewable energy between the countries(Norway 99% vs
Sweden 65%)
I mean Denmark has a better number than Sweden and they have no mountains or real rivers
That's not how it works
Your family might be rich, but you can still do a good job
That's just fucking retarded
Like beyond retarded actually
How is building a wind turbine more impressive and hard work than building a hydroelectric station
How is having favorable wind conditions hard work
Nobody worked for those winds, they are just there
Same with hydropower, those rivers and waterfalls were just there, no work required beyond building a hydro plant
Do people honestly think this is something we just build after we got oil money
Norway has been infamous for awesome hydro power plants since way before oil was even discovered
Norsk Hydro who specialize in hydro power was founded in 1905 for fucks sake
Rjukan ring any fucking bells
It had the worlds biggest hydropower plant since the 1930s when Norway was poorer than Sweden or Denmark yet we're somehow spiled rich cunts
Fuck off, move to Sweden then ;)
But it's still good
If we export more, others use less fossil
And just because our industries grow, somehow our growth in renewable production is neutralised
Stop buying gas, oil and petrol, and we'll stop exporting
Sooooo, you telling me that all we have to do is like take 100 something cars of the road and that would result in something like 10% decrease in emissions
You might be onto something here
Explain how we should get so much credit for having gone for the convenient and abundant hydro power route since basically the beginning (ruining a lot of nature in the process), compared to other nations who have been relying on different methods but are now going over to the more sustainable types for the sake of the environment
We have no right to whine about fucking credit
I was referring to the fact that we're a small country in a giant fucking waterfall, so obviously we've got hydropower
We'd be stupid not to
Imagine if you are the richest country ever to exist in the history of the universe
And then you manage not to give the people living there heath care
We could have been far worse, that's something
While I fully understand your sentiments and good intentions you're ignoring the real need and demands for fossil fuels in the world
You're not denying Norwegians more money, you're denying Kenyans further development (as an example)
There is an increasing need for energy worldwide and there's no viable replacement at the moment
Kenyans won't be buying Teslas any time soon, so solar and electricity are not viable yet
They still need to get to work, etc
I fully support stopping oil & gas extraction, but we have to think about people outside the developed world
> it is best that ... they are extracted in poor countries
In theory, I would agree, but in practice the poorest countries rarely benefit from such resources
Look at Nigeria, Angola, etc
Which is why Norway offers a programme called [Oil for Development
] Through this we help developing countries benefit from their resource by establishing the legal framework, management and investment structure needed to channel the revenue into the country's coffers - and not corrupt officials or int'l energy corporations
> the vast majority of world's remaining fossil fuel supplies must remain in the ground in order for us to be able to deal with climate change
I don't think that's realistic
Yes, we must change, but I don't think you understand the world's energy needs
We must first of all make other energy forms more viable and efficient, so that oil becomes less economically attractive and feasible (extraction costs)
Leaving the oil is fine, if there are better alternatives, and we can cover the energy needs of the entire world
If we were to stop extracting oil today, just the rich countries, you would see a crisis of enormous proportions
The oil price would reach unheard of heights
The poor countries would suffer, as only the richer countries could afford to pay the new prices
The world needs vast amounts of energy and fossil fuels are needed for now

Before you start throwing a tantrum you should consider the possibility that it is you that have something to learn
Your lack of knowledge doesn't have any bearing on the facts
I would say Danish is quite close to gibberish
Even for Danes it can be hard to understand, as seen in [this] Norwegian documentary
icelandic might not be mutually intelligeble but as a norwegian i still understand alot of it, even in written form
i think it’s similar to french and italian for example
The maker of the original one is Finnish or Finnish-Swedish so it's kinda weird since she should know
Is nau used at all
Maybe she used it to make a point about Finnish being different from the other Nordic countries

eesti doesn’t fit into nordic though, it fits so neatly in baltic making it nordic would only be confuse
Finnish flag on the tail make it look like a benis :DDD
Word of god is that there's one tiny enclave of Estonians left
Such a strange theory to have
Was this long ago
Iceland has naturally been more isolated over the centuries than us, who have been run by the Danes and Swedes plenty of times, and Sweden and Denmark were closer to mainland Europe and continental influences
That's bound to affect the language, as anyone with ears would know
Speaker, we are for the d
I refuse to accept that Sweden beat us at something, but I also believe my family alone is enough to drag down the national average
Most people here are pretty good at English, but some are just dreadful
Edit: looked up the exact numbers, Sweden's index is at 625 while Norway is at 624
So this map is kinda misleading but oh well
Bet a Swede made this
bruh
There's no way that Germany should score that high
And there is no way Norway should have as low proficiency as Germany
I have visited Germany quite a few times
It always surprises me how shit they are in English
They have a world class education system
Its me, I'm dragging the whole country down with me
Sweden's index is at 625
Norway's is at 624
We're literally one point down but the crossover point is COINCIDENTALLY set at 625 to make Norway look worse
I bet a Swede made this
We're 624 and Sweden is 625
Literally 1 point apart smh
We have a score of 624
A score of 625 would’ve marked Norway as black as well
Sweden have a score of 625, Finland and Denmark have a score of 631 and 632 respectively, so it’s pretty close
It's all the Swedish immigrants bringing the score down
Probably the older people
English wasn't mandatory at school before 1969
With regards to younger people, I would say Norway should have a much higher score than, say, Finland should
Eastern Norway being eastern Norway
They seem physically incapable of speaking English without a "hødi dødi du" accent

Unfortunately most Danes nowadays seem to speak English automatically with Norwegians as well, often with the excuse “vjii dånnth øjnderstæjnd Svjiiidisj”. You probably have a point in that Norwegian out of us three is a golden ratio, just in the middle between Danish and Swedish
I’ll never succumb into speaking English with a Dane though, I’ll rather try to speak with potatoes down my throat
I was *zinking* about how much of a coast guard Germany have, then googled it and guess what the top results are
I'm sadd af rn
It is
There you go
I think this a lot of times has got to do with being embarrassed of not speaking fluently, and not because they can't speak English well enough to help you
According to a link below Norway got a score of 624, Sweden 625, and Denmark and Finland were 631 and 632 respectively I think
The difference isn't large, but the cut-off in color between 624 and 625 makes this seem like a much more dramatic difference than it is
They were probably Swedes
That's a real "bruh" moment if I've ever seen one
Well at least we try to keep creative with our language and not steal every word we can from English like you guys
Norway got 624 on the index and Sweden got 625
We were on the verge of greatness
Yeah, Sweden, suck it
Ask your fellow Danes
It's very common
Too common
I was once at a wedding with a Danish girl
Her family and me and my BF were the only Scandinavians there, so we used a lot of English in conversations with others, but I tried to speak Norwegian to her when I was talking to her alone
She more or less refused to speak Danish to me, and she was 'afraid of not understanding'. I tried to tell her that it didn't matter to me if she asked me again, that I'd try to speak clearly, but it didn't really work
I've seen this multiple times
People who are afraid of trying because they don't like admitting that they haven't understood
That said it happens the other way around too
I hate it when my fellow Norwegians to it
Like at least *try* in Norwegian first
Do we
Really
Couldn't find a Swede, but I'll try to write as "American" as I can manage:

The Schuman plan is one of the main reasons for the long peace, with the economic integration of Europe war is now unthinkable in Europe and the relations between Germany and France have never been higher
Yeah, a peripheral, localized conflict
That's the worst conflicts that can emerge today
Today is the longest period of time since Rome where no army has crossed the Rhine in either direction is the point
Because the UK has always been sort of half-blooded about their European-ness
They've tended to isolation from continental affairs in the exception when the balance of power was in danger, i.e Napoleon, and both world wars
Its better then the total collapses and self-immolation we tried in the first half of the 20th century

Honest question
Allting er greit
I reckon it's a result of simplifications, learning to differentiate when to use "I" and when to use "me" was difficult enough for misuse to be common
A lot of words and phrases have been misused often enough to become common, without most folks being able to explain why they use them the way they do
Moreover, English is widespread among speakers of other native tongues
For instance, as a Norwegian, to my knowledge the correct way of phrasing "this is I" would be "dette er meg" - however, "meg" is directly translated to "me", whereas "jeg" would be "I" and create the sentence "dette er jeg", which on its own means nothing
If I were to add more words to create the sentence "dette er jeg sikker på" meaning "this I am certain of" it is perfectly valid, while "dette er meg sikker på" is just as incorrect as "this is me certain of", "this me am certain of" or "this is I certain of
Perhaps most of the common errors in grammar applied to English comes from conflicting grammatical rules of native tongues
Norway currently has over 2000 cases of covid-19
That's more than Sweden, despite having half the population
Southern Norway has 1 case per 500 people
Italy has 1 case per 1100 people

We're not a member of the EU, but we are still EFTA members and we are in the European Economic Area (EEA)
Basically, we're still a part of the single market that the UK wants to leave, and we have to adhere to most EU laws that the UK don't want to adhere to (and we have neither a say or a vote in the EU parliament; the UK's special relationship to the EU also means that they have opt-outs from some huge stuff even as members)
Brexiters don't want this
Nor should they, since the UK likely wouldn't benefit much from such a relationship, other than getting to tick the "UK left the EU" box
i mean, technically it is both

Right not sunrise is 8:15, sunset is 15:47/3:47 in Oslo
Further north it will get darker much sooner, and eventually be full darkness 24/7
The opposite way during summer
Further north you have light 24/7
Even in Oslo which is pretty far south, it doesn't feel like it goes completely dark during the summer months

It looks nice
Fukushima caused thousands of unnecessary deaths
Not from radiation
From Germany and Japan shutting down nuclear plants, which lead to more coal, which kills people
It’s likely true though
Just total up all the emissions from coal and gas plants that replaced nuclear plants closed (Or never finished) due to protests
It depends of course on how you define “single biggest”, obviously you could say capitalism or coal power is, but if you wanted to pick out a single social movement I think they’d win
Yeah absolving the 70s or 80s greens of responsibility only makes sense if you say the alternative was using almost no electricity, but that isn’t what the anti-nuclear movement of the time supported in the majority
Saying it’s not their fault because they were just against nuclear but not for fossil fuels is much like barring Jews from all other work but money lending and then saying it’s their choice to become money lenders
I once was on the same flight as the Norwegian queen
I looked around to see if anyone else had noticed, and everyone just kept reading their newspaper pretending they didn't see it

) I like it when the higher-ups are doing casual things

Norway might say it's quite secular but there is still a suprising amount of Christianity in this country that most people seem to forget about
Confirmations are still a large part of growing up (yes, thats a *catholic* tradition in a *lutheren* country
There's even non religious confirmations
), things shut down on Sunday and religious holidays (Whit Monday which was this week shut most things down except the Sunday stores and the garden centres (idfk either)), and schools still offer things like christmas mass and people go (for referance, I'm in VG3 so don't you start about how thats an 'old' thing)
Less and less people are actualy religious but they still all celebrate a lot of the things you're meant to do as a christian
(and it kinda sucks
getting ahold of alcohol around easter is no easy feat between all the bottles closing early and everyone else rushing to get their booze and if you run out of something that isn't haalal or you don't want to comprimise on quality on Sunday or, god forbid, *christmas week*, you're fucked)
Thank god for that
Wait
Norway has a lot of people who are “Christian”. As in, they were born Christian and haven’t bothered to do anything with it since
Probably amounts for A LOT of the people who fall into the Christian part here
I dont believe the Norwegian one for a second and I'm in that age bracket
It wouldnt surprise me if Norways numbeers were to sway even more to the non-religious side due to many not bothering to cancel their church subscription

> Because there are significant diffrences in culture and history between 3 baltic states, which we do ignore, because they look to us, as the same size and location
Which in itself is very interesting
That 3 small countries so close together have such different languages and cultures
Did people there travel less than Scandinavians for instance
In other words, did Norwegians, Swedes and Danes mix more in the past compared to the Baltic, since we have much more similar cultures and languages
Or is it because Denmark and Sweden ruled over Norway for many years, and had more influence that way
Surely someone must have written a book about the history of the Baltic cultural differences
If not someone needs to
At least I think so
Vikings were everywhere first
Just go with ananas
will this affect non EU members too
Shit, what can I do being Norwegian
Will Norway be affected by this
It will indirectly affect us but will we also be affected directly
Did I mention why I don't like the EU
Do Norwegians have a say
Don't vote for any of our politicians who support Orwellian surveillance (DLD, digitalt grenseforsvar) and copyrights schemes (anything advocated for by IFPI), or who will approve all EU directives without protest (Ap, Høyre)
I'm really torn about the EU
While I respect the goal of making another war between European countries pointless, and that it makes us collectively a comparable competitor to the US and China both economically and militarily
I even enjoy seeing EU's antitrust system wrestle down Google and other mega corporations when they do something wrong
But I **really** don't like the idea of being ruled from so far away by people who don't understand my country
Plus, most of the countries in the EU are total shitfests when compared to us and our neighbors
I worked in Ireland for a few months and the living conditions were pitiful
I'd never want to see EU living conditions spread further into Norway
I personally think joining the EEA was just a bad deal forced upon us to even be able to trade, with a constant looming threat of an expectation to eventually accept being ruled from Brussels by Europeans
I've tried to understand the EU multiple times, visited the website and just generally looking it up
But as a Norwegian I feel like I even understand the US government better
I'd personally rather leave your incompetent grasp than become a full member
At least after seeing recent developments
I used to consider joining the EU to be a potentially good idea
But not after my time in Dublin
And it's still burning at full speed
So not as bad as I thought then

I have no idea where OP got the idea that it is free for Norwegians from
We receive support from the Norwegian government to study abroad, but we still pay international tuition fees

New recipe Irn Bru
New recipe Irn Bru is not to love
They could make all UK universities tuition free and probably not face any resistance
I can see Scottish tax payers not being okay with everyone else coming there for the free universities, for as long as their kids can't go study in England, Wales or Northern Ireland for free
> The Scottish parliament could agree to pay a Scott's tuition if they went elsewhere in the UK as well as the tuition of any England, Wales or Northern Ireland citizen in Scotland
Switch that with England/Wales/Northern Ireland agreeing to pay tuition fees for the English/Welsh/Northern Irish if they study in Scotland, and you'll see what it would actually take for it to be equal

Huh
As a Norwegian, I more often use the word "føkk
" which is a norwegianized version of "fuck". On second place is probably "fetta
" which means "cunt" in north Norwegian
"Faen" is too mild a word and is probably quite far down the list of most used curse words for me at least
Denmark is just "dirt" or in the gross parts it could be interpreted as "shit" in norwegian
Denmark is swearing as if they're in Mickey mouse clubhouse
Faen
This was done by a helvetes hestkuk
Faen my ass
Uuuuuuumh what’s going on with Spain
They seethe
In Norwegian “Jøder” means “Jews” so if anyone unironically uses that as a curse word, some eyebrows are definitely going to get raised
Actually the Norwegian one is OK because it's probably our most used word
I'm guessing the same goes for Sweden because it's the same word
But Denmark LOL
Hey, I'm guessing from your flag that you're a Finn
Do you really use vittu more than pärkele
Faen is a name for a/the devil, and at least some of the Norwegian idioms with faen reflect that meaning
E.g. "Faen ta deg" - "May the devil take you", "Faen holder hånden over sine egne" - "The devil protects his own", "stakkars faen" - "poor devil"
But granted, it is also used in a lot of ways where the literal meaning of the word doesn't make sense (the same way fuck is used in English)
These is no "faen" in Iceland
Interesting
I think it can be more accurately transcribed as following:
Dane: * indecipherable sounds *
Swede: * blank stare *

The Norwegian equivalent:

- The even better second season with even more action
- The even better third season with the plot branching out
- Fourth season was ok
- The new head writer for the fifth season decided to kill off half the cast, completely ruining the show (black death)
- Sixth season bought up by the Danes, they made it into a shitty soap opera
- Kept going as a shitty soap opera for 3 more seasons
- Tenth season bought up by the Swedes, made some improvements, still a soap opera
- 11th season it tried to get back to its roots and succeeded, although with much less action, however the last 3 episodes clearly had insane amounts of money thrown at them
- Ongoing season is looking promising

Why the fuck is the EU so bad at regulating tech
At this point I'm sure they would've banned color TV in the 50s if they could
I doubt they even understand the legislation they're voting on, in fact i think MEPs in general don't understand the vast majority of what they vote on
They're presented a huge amount of text, much of which they have no education, experience or other means to properly understand
At the very least all MEPs who voted for this, and all parties who voted in majority in favor of this, need to be blacklisted and not be voted for in the 2019 election
If this passes the final vote, then the next step is to have it removed ASAP
Whata fuck are they doing, they ruined internet once now they deliver the final killing blow
Old conservatives who don't understand the internet fucking everyone else over
When they release which MEPs voted for and against, I want you people to vote correctly next time, and not get those bastards into power, I mean we fought two fucking wars against each other, of course we can change those bastards

What made the greens gain popularity
I read somewhere that German greens are very moderate and pragmatic
Our greens worship elves, want to enforce veganism and generally live in a dream bouble
They also want to phase out oil and stop flights between Bergen, Oslo and Trondheim
I did a double-take when i saw where you're from, as i did not recognize your description at all
Our green party is generally heading in the same direction as the Germans, even if they are a few years behind and not as anti-nuclear - they are gaining popularity for a reason, and that reason isn't Tolkien fans
And cut Norways exports by almost 40%.
Nuclear power would mean the end of Russian gas, and thus the end of the russian grasp on Central and Eastern Europe

A bit south of Bergen, no
We're having floods:
No, the east
It's been like this the whole summer, except or two weeks in June
Most look exceedingly happy
Yeah, map of Europe, but doesn't show Iceland at all, and only parts of Scandinavia, but does include North Africa
Poland is upside down^/s
I honestly couldn't care less
Its literally just balls with eyes colored after their respective flags
Uninteresting and overdone at this point
What would actually be cool with be each country's national animal colored after flags, or something like that
The sami in the north
And Iceland
Those apples look tasty
I would take a bag full as well
This is what irks me when people complain about "wasting food". Yeah ok, lets say we remove 100% of food waste
Now you have 50% of the farmers and a large portion of the food industry out of business and a recession on your hands
Great success
There is no lack of food, only a lack of customers
It's always estonia that does these awesome things
Maybe you should be welcomed into the nordic warmth after all

Kjolen mountains = woman's dress mountain

How does the presents come out of the log
Older part of the road = fine
Newer part = not so fine
Why were we made like this
It's like 18 degrees outside and I'm figuratively burning to death
You can use them for energy efficient heating in winter, so it's slowly becoming a thing in Norway at least
(heat pumps)
Not ground heat pumps
Those are way more expensive to install
They're great but not common at all
I'm talking about air-based heat pumps
Speaking of
I'm actually surprised at how many Swedes didn't know that H&M is Swedish
Well Sweden is just the place where Norway keeps the dumb people from Finland in

(Brent currently at $57) Except the 2007 price was a drop from the 2006 price, and grew to over $120 over the following year
While today's price is comparatively stable, after recovering from the drops in late 2014 early 2015 and again late 2015 early 2016
>  user installed apps and a wide range of connectivity (3G, BT, Wifi)
Nokia did have that tough - I have a N95 from 2007 which has all that + GPS, and came preinstalled with Google maps, Opera browser (+ their own thing), and I installed Skype + a few other things on it
It was pretty decent, especially compared to the first iPhone, which did not really have apps (they had fancy bookmarks), 3G connectivity, copy/paste, ... - it's main features was a touch screen and a slightly better browser (but slower network), and iTunes
In 2007, the top Nokia phone was still ahead of the top iPhone
In a lot of countries the current oil price affects the price of directly oil based products
In Norway the current oil price determines everything: market conjuncture, job market, interest rates, even trends in education and the political situation
Paying attention to oil prices is just prudent if you live in Norway
Oil prices are often mentioned on main stream Norwegian news during times of changes (i.e. they're not hidden away in the economy section)
With last weekend still fresh in our minds, may I express my hopes that it has an up-to-date fire suppression system to go with the spiffy new exterior

Damn i feel like a 90 year Old :/ what Does this pixel meme mean
How do you toss out the old corrupt ones and not just replace them with new ones
Ask Ukraine about how well the "revolutions" worked out for them, they keep just getting shit politicians in place of the old ones
>It makes me very sad because I still remember my grandmother telling me about hunger during the Second World War
Shouldn't you be happy that we have the opposite problem
I mean, it's still not optimal, but noone is starving anymore
I just usually just ask the people who work in the grocery shops if they have anything they're planning to throw away anf if I could have it instead
And usually they agree because to them thats better than me digging it out of their garbage where all of their customers pass by
For my work i need at least 3000 calories a day, otherwise i lose weight
Also, that's a massive improvement over the 1940s. More people live by not starving than die due to the pollution
Sure, we need to improve, but we also need to appreciate just how happy we should be to be doing so well
See
In the Netherlands they just *hate* bikes, but no-one's listening to me
Yeah, I've noticed the same here in Oslo, they tend to crack up and get potholes after 2-3 years

Literally the entire Scandinavian area does this
We do the same in norway but at 14:00
Ive done it my whole life
We have the exact same thing in norway
Same in Norway
My town in southern Norway has gotten a total of 5 sun hours this month
Same thing in Norway, pushed myself up early in mid November because the forecast said clear skies after having it rain for weeks
That's the last time I saw the sun
Could you post one without the white bars, and just the original subtitles
From just this image alone you could very easily have faked those subtitles, I know you haven't but just saying
Wait, is that greyed-out road between Norway and Sweden intentional
Secret level exit
We have fences here in Bergen (norway) with loads of swastikas on it in the middle on the town center
My grandfather (Im also Norwegian) supposedly played with German military equipment after the Nazis left
There was a lot of cartridges and other stuff around, and the kids were like "OH SHINY" and went with it
I gotta ask my grandma if she has some of this stuff
When I was in the army we still had some Nazi war loot
I had a flare gun where every part was stamped with swastikas and eagles
When you lose a war you also lose all your stuff I guess
Also there was a German bunker about 20 m from my parents house
Most common hunting rifles in Norway are all Mausers with intact swastikas, Reichsadlers and Waffenamts after all
My father-in-law is rumored to have all manner of things the Nazis left behind, including radio equipment
I can't vouch for this, because I haven't seen it, as the man is a wee bit of a hoarder and his work areas would make Reodor Felgen suggest it's time to clean up (end Norwegian in-joke)
See, most of Norway was never retaken
The Soviets liberated Finnmark but the rest of the country remained occupied until 8 May 1945
Terboven in fact had an idea that Norway should be the site of the Nazis' last stand, which fortunately didn't happen
But that also means they didn't retreat, they just ran, and there was no time to pack up things that might help the enemy
They left all sorts of crap behind
Are you talking about the yellow building in " Christian Michelsens gate"? If so; it's not swastikas
See the [municipality's website] for the explaination
oki im corrected
I'm 32, so this was over 10 years ago
There wasn't much of it still around, but some odd bits like the flare gun and some sights for artillery was still in use
I believe someone had some parts for an M42 as well, but I may be misremembering
We don't use any German small arms anymore save for some very few converted Mauser K98ks
The Norwegian firm Våpensmia at Dokka made some sniper rifles based on G98/K98k receivers designated NM149 and NM149F1
They got pretty much everything but the bolt and receiver swapped
Nowadays it's mostly replaced by the HK417 anyways, and you can only find it in the worst equipped parts of the armed forces
I guess flare guns is the only thing that still sees any normal use, plus maybe some tools
Japan is light years ahead in terms of candy development

In oslo, norway, I believe it was 30 in my class if I remember correctly
It has been 30 from primary to high school at least in my experience
Does this show students pr teachers or actually average class size
Because I'd say student pr teacher is much more Interesting and important for the students
For Norway students pr
Teachers in primary school is 15
Couldn't find anything reliable on class sizes
Source:
I'm a Norwegian, we have pretty big classes
My class from 1st to 7th grade had about 50 students, all other classes in that school ranged anywhere from 30 to 60
Other schools in my area were the same
I have a couple of originals on the wall :D
I was reading EVERY A&O comic I could get my hands on as a kid, borrowed a bunch of great comics from my uncle
I'm actually considering buying the complete series of A&O, C&H and a few others I read as a kid
We definitely had them when i grew up
Not my personal favorite but I'm sure most people remember them fondly
Oh man my childhood right there
Me and my grandmother used to watch them in german and she translated everything to norwegian
Great times
I know who they are, but I never had any comics or books about them as a child, I think the first time I saw them for real was the actors motion picture about Egypt or Babylon or something
Tintin was the hype, I had tons of comics and audio tapes, movies, and even those infamous ones when he is in Kongo
They showed the swedish dubbed version on TV and it was well voiced
Great comic, don't know why it never fully made it overseas like in Europe
It's interesting how the statistics get better the more south you get
Maybe the weather and climate plays a bigger role
I can't recall the source at the moment, but I read that a sizable part of the difference between men and women is the preferred method
If you compare the rates of *attempted* suicide men and women are a lot more even, but for various reasons women more frequently survive their attempts
To be fair, openly criticizing Putin counts as suicide in Russia
Damn, life is sad in Russia
> It's interesting how the statistics get better the more south you get
Maybe the weather and climate plays a bigger role
This is a good reminder to remember to eat our D-vitamins/tran (can actually boost mood in winter) Also interesting that Norwegian rates are better than in France
And looking at west/east money and oportunities seems to play an important role as well
Typical women, can't even kill themselves properly
Research shows that in societies where there is nothing else to blame (bad government, etc), people may actually end up taking their own lives because they have no other excuse
Yes it does
Interestingly, there's another aspect to that:
"[Past] [research] has shown that residents of Tromsø, northern Norway have lower rates of wintertime depression than would be expected given the long winters and high latitude
In fact, the prevalence of self-reported depression during the winter in Tromsø, with its latitude of 69N, is the same as that of Montgomery County, Maryland, at 41N," Kari Leibowitz, a PhD student at Stanford University who spent a year in Tromsø studying the residents' mental health, [explained in the *Atlantic*]
In the fascinating and lengthy article, Leibowitz recounts her time spent in the far north, explaining exactly how Norwegians get through months and months of dark days and brutal weather relatively unscathed, as well as offering tips that can help you be less miserable this winter yourself
Apparently, your mood all comes down to [your mindset] \-- not what it says on the thermometer
A researcher I heard speaking on the subject said that in societies where there is nothing else to blame (bad government, etc), people may actually end up taking their own lives because they have no other excuse
That's a strong claim, do you have any evidence for that
I don't think you know us at all
Up here in the far north we're outside regardless of weather and season, we are known for roaming our forests, seas and mountains all of the time
You'll find people between 8 and 80 years old swimming, trekking, walking and skiing all year round
We really love being outside, while you guys have to hide from the sun ;)

As the owner of a STASJONSVAGN, I've accompanied many non-scandinavian people to the local (Swiss) IKEA
Knowing a scandinavian language definitively makes the store more insteresting to visit
Especially the food part - for example the herring stuff is all in sweedish (except a small sticker with french translation of the names of the additives)
First thought: at least they're using the proper status code
Second thought: ehh they're actually subverting it because at this point it's their own choice to not serve the content without tracking
So Sweden and Denmark are viewed as socialistic, but North Korea is not

people who blame columbus, a single man, for the actions of empires need to go back to the school bench
saying columbus can be held responsible for genocides when it was infact the british, spanish, french and portugese empires along with the americans who did all the work is a little disingenous

A possibility could've been to kinda exchange some meters here and there

It's just symbolic anyway
I think we do that with Russia every few years since the border is in the middle of a river and rivers change
I've never heard that, and it doesn't really make any sense
I've heard about that one but forgot
Great example on how it could be done
In Norway, those are called berlinerbolle

Edit: wonder why your church calendar differs from ours
We have a tradition for eating cream filled buns around this time as well
Funny how a lot of countries kept the "fatten up" part leading up to the Lenten fast period but then skip the fasting bit, I'm not really aware of any Christians who actually practice the 40 days of partial fasting/dietary restrictions following it at least
Finally a holiday i can get behind importing
Nice
Yup
And my Polish colleague brought a bunch of these for lunch today
Edit: For all of us
Pfannkuchen translates to pancake
That name makes no sense for these buns
We eat tons of these, especially in the north during the period when the sun returns after its absence during the dark winter period
During this time they're called Solbolle (sun-bun)
Usually 3 variants are sold; Sugar outside, no filling
Icing sugar outside, vanilla cream inside
Icing glaze outside, raspberry jam inside
Both Lutheran, so that doesn't explain it
Either our "fast" starts 2 weeks earlier, or it lasts 2 weeks longer
Wow, TIL
Oh, is the Estonian bun-eating-day from a Catholic tradition

Food storage houses (stabbur)  were usually built on stilts in ways that made it difficult for mice and rats, but not cats, to get in
The little houses on stilts looks too small to live in
Maybe they are cabins being rented out to holiday guests
Theres probably not a very good reason, I think it might be something about preserving space
The sea looks fuzzy because of long exposure
Short exposure would make the photo too dark to see anything
Other than that it doesn't look photoshopped to me
This doesn't actually look that edit
These houses are not "Stabbur". So i guess the only reason here is because of the difficult topography

Okay, I'm probably going to get downvoted into oblivion but this is my opinion after all
I really don't care about the Notre dame fire nor whatever happened here because they are only buildings and never injured or hurt anyone
Every existing building, whether it's new or old, will eventually disappear sometime
Why worry about buildings burning down when there are so many more important things to worry about, such as terrorism, cancer, wars or natural disasters
And now they expect us to donate money to rebuild the church
How will bringing back a building make the world a better place when the money could go to for example research or healthcare

000 children, but how many pedophiles was involved
Kind of ironic that the police seems (at least earlier) really reluctant to tackle both the prince and the immigrant pedophiles
(Just watched ["The Prince & The Epstein Scandal"] and I was very surprised by the fact that the police knew about prince Andrew's crime years ago but decided not to investigate)
> I refuse to believe this is an England-specific problem
Wouldn't be surprised if the same issues were prevalent in France or Germany and other countries but that the British media is simply more open about this stuff
The UKs ranking in the [World press freedom Index] is actually lower than both Germany and France
In fact UKs ranking is the lowest in western Europe
> Immigrants in France are from Maghreb and Subsaharian Africa, not Pakistan nor Bangladesh
I recently watched a documentary about pedophiles in Pakistan
And they mentioned a survey done including 18
000 Pakistani men
30% of them saw nothing wrong with child abuse
30%! So it shouldn't be a surprise that some of them bring this culture to the countries they move to
Edit: [Source]
Another thing is that Germany has [more press freedom than the UK] So German news are more likely to report on these things
..or the royal family
How has the prince Edward thing affected people view of the royal family in the UK
Our princess is dating a shaman, which has made more people talk about rather becoming a republic
So I cant even start to imagine what sex trafficking would do to people's view on the royal family
> There was & is nothing illegal about sleeping with a 16 year old in the UK
Morally wrong, and extremely sleazy
Definitely, but nothing legally actionable
So sex trafficking is legal in the UK as long as the girl is 17 or older
I find that quite horrifying to be honest
> Edit: We may also benefit from having different countries using the same language
In particular, there is high quality German speaking press in Germany, Austria and Switzerland
With this, you can reduce the blindspots even further
Doesn't seem to make a difference since the [countries on top of the World press freedom index] speak languages not spoken elsewhere
I just think its the level of influence government and corporations have over the press
(The less the better)
Finland are you OK
Let's mention **Time zones** in the discussions of these maps

I feel bad for UK, and i really don’t want the EU to change its stance, but Norway is said to be one of the worst affected in a no deal scenario so I am really nervous about this
Especially since I live in western Norway, who, according to the heatmap posted here recently, is going to be worse off than the rest
What are you talking about
Norway is the worst affected by a soft Brexit where they join the ETFA
We do not want the UK into the EFTA
Currently this is pretty much a special deal where Norway is a big player in how it's working along with Switzerland
Do you know what would happen if the UK joined
It would quickly become the UK shitshow agreement
If the UK wants a deal with the EU they should make one just for them, the EFTA should remain for the smaller countries
If Scotland leaves the union with England they would be the correct size to join without tilting the balance of powers, however they would probably opt for a straight EU membership
The UK has no place in the EFTA, they are too big and need their own deal to avoid ruining EFTA for the smaller countries
I don't think the UK would be pleased with the EFTA currently anyway but the UK into the EFTA would be a huge blow to EFTA support in the smaller countries currently part of the agreement and probably a step back in regards to getting the small countries to join EU long term, something the EU would like
I read 1% decrease in BNP
Did not know they wanted into the EFTA
Thought they wanted an independent arrangement within the EEC
One could hope, but sadly no
There is no debate in Norway about joining the EU
There is, however, a debate from the outer left about leaving EFTA and EEC and sail our own way, much like the UK
Thankfully it is not widely supported and only the parties left of AP (labour) are for it
AP and H (conservatives) are both rather positive to the EU, but are for now happy with being in the EEC
They have talked about it as one of the possibilities, it would be really bad for the current members as it would greatly reduce the balance of the agreement between them

i work in tourism and almost exlusively all the americans i meet are anti trump

The German tourist is inaccurate
they think all beaches are nudist beaches
Trust me on this one
In Norway, German tourists clog up our roads with their wohnwagen from May trough August

Overcrowd our fishing villages all year round
Stand in their rental boats while fishing, and if they manage to not capsize and drown, return home with hundreds of kilos of fish fillet

From California to the Midwest
Most of them seem to be quite well off, educated and traveled
We're talking middle aged and above, lawyers, engineers and other professionals
Now, some of the younger crowd seems more anti-Trump, but they were also New Yorkers
I've seen plenty of wealthy Russian tourists in Spain, but you have to go to the better hotels/destinations
Normal Russians generally go to countries that are cheaper and hotels that are all inclusive

Maybe the US is a bit more negative, though other than that I cant think of anyone
I'm surprised Denmark didnt rank higher
I wonder why
From what I've seen in the news princess Mary who is Australian is very popular over there
The rest of the Scandinavian royals don't register
Only thing I could think of actually
And that Sweden gave them cheapo furniture through tax shelters
Maybe they rank a little below the rest because of all the awesome Nordic noir exported there
Too many serial killers roaming around in submarines irl there or something
Let's put another shrimp on the barbie
We are definitively Anglophile
Outside of Scandinavia, I would say we are closest to the UK culturally, and you guys will be always be a great ally
Not negative, they just don't know we exist
Made me laugh
Thanks
Shh
I hope to one day wake up as some kid beeing fooled completly by my friends
That all this is some prank and my naive good nature is making them able to make me an hillarious joke
Maybe some fraternity hazing or something
&#x200B;
My blind faith in my peers good nature getting the best of me

Norway could have hit 1%...
This is perfect
I saw a documentary once about a Danish man visiting North Korea
He constantly talked about how horrible everything was there - but the watchers never understood what he said
(His speech is especially slurred because of cerebral palsy)
Edit: [found it]

It dosn't work as well when written though
Norwegians and most Swedes can understand what you wrote just fine
It's the same travel patterns, trends and flights
Similar people flock to the same places
My parents went to Germany on a trip, going out of the hotel they met their neighbor walking past
He wasn't even staying at the same hotel
Don't feel too safe, your language is pretty easy to pick up on :D I have some Czech friends here, took me a summer to understand the basics
We are in Europe and on r/europe
They could have put Norway in it and changed from EU to Europe
hæ?
Ass-bananas
What's confusing
I am assuming it is bananas that at some point has been inside the rectum of an individual
What a cool photo
Love what the Pole is wearing
Is it some type of national costume or just the fashion at the time
Nice
I'm half Norwegian but my other side is Hungarian, romanian and german with some slavic i think
Oh wow
Really elaborate
God natt
Hello, I found the exact spot on Google Maps

As a Norwegian i can smell this picture
I totally live in that house
The roofes are made of peat laid on birch bark on top roofing supports/planks, this is the traditional way anyway
Today we would have to dig up every single peaty bog to roof everybody
It also only works on sloped roofes, as a flat roof would be turned into bog if not drained properly
It's not hard to understand why many people here in Norway quickly adopted the metal sheet roof or stone shingle roof when they became available
Bog roofes don't need changing in a long time, but when it must be changed, it takes a lot if work
Metal sheets or shingles is much easier
Hard place to move to, but you are welcome to visit after covid
Groceries
Nah
We hunt trolls here
From the map somebody [linked] there is a gravel road close by
You can see the dip in the landscape on the right of the picture where it goes

And Daly continued insisting for years that the protesters were unarmed and were not doing anything that could reasonably be considered threatening to the armed soldiers
It took the official reports until *2010* to admit that he had been telling the truth all along
Good luck
Germany is not reducing their dependency on coal, they are increasing it
Norway has no coal plants here we just chill with our hydroelectric power
Nah the norm in Norway and likely Sweden as well is to either heat with electricity or by burning wood
My parents have an above average home and burn about 4-5 tonnes of wood each winter
I don't think this is uncommon
It also happens with many other types of goods, like oil and whatnot
Why do you think this is due to corruption
It certainly doesn't make intuitive sense, but from how I understood it, its more about how economics and trade works
Anyone with some insight on the subject
It does sound unlikely
Oh yeah it's crazy to heat with wood in cities
I have no insight, I would just question the economics in opening a new plant and close it a few years later
Often when things seem to stupid\\good to be true, it's at least because the information is incomplete
Makes Spain look like a desert
This is why Norway doesn't fear climate change
We will definitively still be above water
If this was real we would all need to learn rock climbing up here
I tried that
Apparently I'm only in trouble if the ocean rices above 30m...
Most probably
Does this mean Italians also drive nicely now
Yes
The Virus made you guys Scandinavian
Looks like Norway
Alcohol
Wow Italians are organized
That's the most Greek thing I've heard yet
/joke
Poland be like: This doesn't seem right
Hold up

I'm glad they're doing it publicly, and I'm glad they're looking into modernising the laws regarding illegal content online
Systems across the web are wildly different, and many of them simply don't work, or are overzealous to the detriment of users
"Filtering all uploaded content" is also a very vague term, and it's not necessarily bad
I'm gonna have to see more information on what that entails before I make up an opinion on it
I do like that they're talking about user interaction with the systems, it'd be nice to have a legal framework for how to handle reports of illegal content on a site
The time it takes for the system to process said reports is often too long, YouTube in particular is faaaar too slow to respond to counter-claims
Fuck, now i wish i had a say
Reminds me of this (old) story:
*"A Norwegian court has refused to extradite a suspected drug smuggler to the United States, saying he might suffer inhumane conditions in an American jail
"* [Source]
I believe 90% of US prisons are government owned though
Seems im a bit out of the loop
Whats the deal with Theresa May lately
Haven't seen this in ages, glad someone linked it :D
I'm laughing so much right now
Great sense of humour Vilnius
I thought the exact same thing
Mabye that's just what they look like in Lithuania  who knows
hopefully you can force it through to january and get back in
would honestly love to see you remain
and to see the whole shit show was for nothing but that’s more for my own sake
[For those that don't get the reference]
Youtube: QI | They Say Of The Acropolis Where The Parthenon Is
good to know that i live in one of thethe coldest places in europe right now
(Northern Norway/Troms & Finnmark)
I fled western norway to far north to stop the unbearable moist sweats
I thought it said “someone has finally arrived
” and I legitimately made a highly audible “shocked” sound
Then I read it again, and it made sense
sometimes i wish i was russian, just for the even cooler climate
Cant wait for fall here in Norway
This heat is atrocious
Its 30°C here in Steinkjer, Norway
Which is at the same latitude as Reykjavík. Next week it should drop down to about half and lower
Can't wait
Nordic Passport unite
We can literally just tell the government "I am Icelandic now", and boom, you get an Icelandic passport
(Have to live there for some years first, with all the rights anyway)
No application even needed
i barely tolerate anything warmer than 24 degrees
With other countries, you still have to apply for citizenship
Within the Nordics, _we inform the government_, and change
We don't apply to become Swedish, we tell the government that we are Swedish
And they just have to accept it
It's not an application
An application suggests it might be turned down
Which is what other nationals live with
Didn’t read the title right, so i thought you talked about a plane bombing
Where the fuck is norway
Jeg er fra Norge og skjønner ikke hva som står skrevet her
The UK is independent
***Any*** trade deal you make with another country "removes independence
" That's what happens when you bind yourself to agreements for mutual benefit
>if there is someone above you
There is no one above
The UK has a seat on the European Council, which is the actual supreme authority in the EU
It's just really easy for politicians to then act like it doesn't exist and so use the EU as an easy scapegoat for basically anything
>paying millions and billions for other countries that benefit you in no way
Bullshit
The return on those payments are *huge,* and they're barely spit in the bucket compared to what the UK gets in exchange as an EU member
Trying to rip them out of context is ridiculous
They *have* been used for the direct benefit of UK citizens on important projects that Westminster has no plans for replacing
Those "other countries"(which includes Wales and poor English areas btw) are countries that the UK has *free trade* with, and thus the UK directly benefits from those countries being helped with projects that make them more productive and thus able to buy more goods and services from the UK
I came up with the idea that my children can stay up 30 min longer if they spend that time reading
Now we borrow new books for them at the library almost every week
Ib4 - oh, Norway was so poor before oil - yadayada
what else does these countries have in common
For having a history of being Sweden or Denmark's bitch and most academia being Swedish or Danish for ages we did better than I had imagined
> RemindMe
7 years
Here is another good one: when sitting around the dinner table, ask your children to give you one high and one low from their school day
The answers will be much better than if you just ask "How was school today
I have a brother who has dyslexia, and this would not have worked on him
But audio books can be a good alternative
Your young children use reddit
My daugther will also read during the day
So she reads one book in 2-3 days
My son does not read as much outside the 30 minutes, so he spends more days per book
I'm the only Norwegian I know who does this
My son doesn't like reading much
He prefers his computer
But he loves Sci fi
So I borrowed a lot of sci fi books for his age at the library, so he has been reading those
He still prefers his computer, but at least he is enjoying the books when he read them
You need to be in the sub (so not in "messages"), and then scroll down and look on the right side
It's called flair
As an aussie and european in scandinavia this made me tear up in several languages
Rain would be good
I'm from outside Bergen, When Norwegians hear Bergen, they think rain
last year we had something like 180 days of rain
Now, After months of drought, [this is what our freshwater supply looks like at the moment
Water levels now drop 7 cm per day, and It is expected to run out in 3 weeks or so, and still no rain in sight
If we have to import water from other parts of Norway, we will never hear the end of it
The fuck
It DOESN'T rain in Bergen
This is truly the end of times
I'd say both
Due to the instability in climate caused by increasing the CO2 concnentration in the atmosphere, more extreme weather situations are likely to develop until the climate stabilises
I would say it is an extreme situation, Like i said, Last year we had something like 180 days of rain
According to the local news paper, the last time this happened was in the 60s, unfortunately the population has more than doubled since then, and the local government has been lagging behind in expanding the water supply, because frankly, the idea of a drought anywhere near Bergen sounds like a joke
It's a football metaphor
Here the EU is giving Erdogan another one of many yellow cards (a warning), which don't really matter by themselves unless they add up to a red card (a penalty)
A couple of weeks ago I had a real Indian guy calling me from not so real "Microsoft". I can't believe they still do that
As everyone must have heard about the scam by now
Never received a robocall before though
Flight changes for instance are usually sent out by sms
(Norway)
Hi, this is Sanjeet from Microsoft
That wasnt the scam you do have wirus on your komputor
We need you look to the URL LogMeIn
com and find the code for me so I can login to fix the wirus or there will be ten charges standing against your name
I don't mind being among the bottom three on this list
wtf sweden how did you do that
I think Norway is in the clear this year
Fingers crossed
Coming from Texas this is not a club I want to be back in
Honestly, what's a lot worse is that there's only a few left to join the "all time high temperature set in the 2000s" club
That could change today
When you stop raiding our villages for bikes we might consider it
Wait a minute
You guys are actually more viking than i thought
You have a strong case here, but i have to hear what my fellow nords have to say about this
Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Iceland i call upon thee
Yeah, I heard some talk about Voss might reach 37 or something
Come on, last is best in this one
(pumping oil for y'all, but hush
Whut
Why not Norway
It's at least 35 in Norheimsund, so wouldn't surprise me
Mind you, that's going off a snap of a friend's car, so can't vouch for accuracy
We shiver in fear when we see the lithuanian longtrucks approaching in the distance
Ooops
Reading your comment makes me kind of angry and sad if you think that's what the reality have to be
In my western democracy there's almost a sport in criticizing the leader and their government, even though our current leader is the most popular figurehead in our current political reality
'No one' here really expect a leader to change anything, rather we just wait for them to fuck it up for us to tear them down from their given pedestal
That is how democracy should work
It exist to weed out the idiots, not elevate the next charismatic asshole
[wutɕ]
Good
I bought an android phone 6 months ago, and on the front page there is a google search bar that can not be moved, removed or in any other way be turned off
Very annoying
I have no idea what you are talking about, so I guess that means no
:D (But I will google it and try)
I have nothing against google on my phone, I just don't want them to take up so much space on my front page
I can move around everything else, expect this
Proto-Greek snow looks like uwu
and "dude" in Norwegian
So that's where the song "It's raining men" came from
The Sami language is one of the two official languages of Norway (Norwegian and Sami)
There are many Sami languages though
The Sami languages are taught in Norwegian schools, these days everyone learns the alphabet in elementary school, but only a minority choose to learn the full language
It's official in a few municipalities up north
There's a Sami parliament supported by Norwegian law, and funds are available for cultural preservation; including public radio and TV in Sami
- [The Sami language news] by Norwegian public broadcasting (NRK) is shared and broadcast by Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish public TV
Hasn't corbyn been anti brexit for months/years
Not from the UK but this isn't exactly new to me
I guess it's maybe cause part of the left is usually pretty anti Eu
I guess he knows the same way you know what 'every brexiteer thought'?
I doubt the guy you replied to is a politician, though he refers to himself as a brexiteer
I also doubt brexiteer usually refers to a politician
Should've included the city pictured on your pass on the map
Have fun travelling, though
What places are you going to visit
I wholeheartedly agree
Such a nice way of seeing Europe
I even know people who went inter-railing with their children
I can see my fathers house in the picture below
Looks like it's my town, Trondheim on the cover
My class are planning on going on a class trip from trondheim (city thats right there) any recommendations
Yes, it's Trondheim :-)
Sounds ex*c*iting to not have planned the whole journey ahead, bon voyage
Edit: typo
She is in a fucked up situation
No matter how well she does her job she will be remembered as a disgrace
It will make life way more miserable for nearly every British citizen when the Brexit starts so I guess she takes a win where she can get it
Murdoch only owns the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times of UKs newspapers
Dude, falu sausage or "falukorv" as we say here in Norway is the shit
The tower of babel
i disagree, i think it looks kinda cool, however it doesn’t fit these houses, would look better in an urban area or something
Looks dope
Can you make oslo
How do you easterners survive
Dont show this to people, they will come
Whoever made this forgot Denmark
Averages wages are usually a bit misleading, median gives a better picture of what a "normal person" earns
The UK has some of the poorest areas in Western Europe
Great link, thanks
Interesting to see how the US ties with Denmark and beats everyone except Luxembourg and Switzerland
Everything is cheaper in the US except healthcare
They have it quite good there even though we Europeans pretend they are a developing nation at times
Meanwhile, despite our oil sector beefing up the economy, we're still below Denmark and the US
Might be because they left out the private sector
Don't think it would up the number that much to be honest but I think we would be slightly ahead of Denmark and the US
When some off us buys a new car, almost 50% off the money goes to the state as different taxes
That's the price off the car + 100% off the cars value in taxes
So trust me cars don't cost the same in different countries in Europe
Yes, it's probably not as bad when you [consider purchasing power] however all the people who dont manage to have jobs on standardized pay scales will still be poor
There was a great article in a norwegian newspaper about these areas a while back and they had this [graph] showing that the UK has both the richest and the poorest areas in Western Europe (adjusted for purchasing power)
Avearage pay for teachers in Norway is about £50k a year, and a little bit outside the big cities you could probably pull all of that off on a single salary (though it would be tight)
Congrats :)
Happy Independence Day
