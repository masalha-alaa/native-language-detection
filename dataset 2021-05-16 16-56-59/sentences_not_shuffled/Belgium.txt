The massive scale in which Leopold II killed congolese people
People always think the only casualties that fell where on the plantations but the local police force also killed random people for no reason
Because he also build up the countries infrastructure people think its ok for his statues to still stand
I've talked to people from Brittany who told me stories their (great) grand-parents told them
They were forbidden from speaking Breton, not just at school, but also in the streets in general
So a lot of them didn't bother teaching the language to their children
I'm assuming the same was happening with other languages
His statues remain because he is part of our country's history
Isn't it ironic that we have talked more about his misdeeds because of these statues , more than any year before ? Proving that they're serving their purpose; talking about history instead of burrying it
What you did to Greenlanders, and to a lesser extent Icelanders, during your colonial time is worse though, and unjustified
While resentment and rage against Germans was understandable after WW2
Don't we give statues to people we want to honor
We shouldnt forget what happened in Congo and i dont think statues are the best way of that
Imo the statues belong in a museum, but I don't really care
I've never seen any of his statues anyway
No they just fall from a window
That's not mysterious, everyone can have such accidents
Leopold II isn't just any mass-murderer
He did a lot for the country through bad actions
Making him an important part of our history
The dude is omnipresent in Brussels architectur
And I'm not defending his deeds here, just letting you know how uneducated your argument is
Actually, a statue of his in Ostend was vandalised by chopping off a hand of one of the African figures as a sign of protest, and it has remained that way ever since
The city is not planning on restoring it as they do want to show the misdeeds that happened during the colonial period
They also stated that they don't want to "hide it" in a museum, but instead leave it where it is with a critical text on colonialism in multiple languages so that it is visible for everyone to see
>I'm done pretending it isn't stupid to act like the statues are important
If statues are not imporant, why bother to remove them ?
&#x200B;
>Hitler built large parts of the Autobahn in Germany
Should we keep statues of him hanging about in parks
I honestly don't see the problem with Germany having Hitler statues either
Again, to me a statue is a history artifact
Nobody asks you to put flowers at its feet
I don't see how it's an honor for Hitler to have his statue remaining if most of what we remember of him are his atrocious policies and the war he caused, and that those things are acknowledged
It's really about not hiding the past
And again that's exactly what's great about the Leopold II statues , people talked about it
Should Rome remove all the statues from Roman emperors ? Should France destroy every public mention of Napoleon ?
The Netherlands, it's just a matter if time until it happens
Goodbye France
Never really liked you
Definitely France . We would finally be rid of their ego and sail directly to Italy
And also, Germany would have no reason to invade us anymore
The Netherlands
I don't wanna live in the southern Netherlands anymore, it's called Belgium you pricks
England
They're leaving anyway
A lake of beer xD
first time i actually agree with a frenchman
I'm going to agree with this
You must be one of those peope Frankie Boyle was talking about
With the fins
Nobody makes fries like Belgium
Not even Luxembourg
No it's not
Just like all the othet microstates
And kids might be a little safer in Rome for a while
Honestly you lot arent even part of eu anymore so you can go and take a swim
I know they use the Euro but they're not in the EU
"free" is a code word for "paid by someone else"
I hope it'll soon spread here
But first we need the government to form
Of course nothing is free
a pissing contest against the wind during a storm
You need to suffer from a terminal (physical or psychological) condition
The problem is that it's not always clear where the line for "suffering" and "terminal" is, especially with psychological conditions
I'm quite sure that has been legal since the invention of marriage
Some people you just don't want to help
And then Stalin reverted most of them :(
In Belgium euthanasia is applied by a physician
At this point I (still) believe that Johnson will be the loudest (and fastest) route to a complete standstill and new general elections
In the context of Brexit it highers the chances of a no-deal (because that's still the default outcome) if things won't find a faster gear
He has the advantage that he at least has a plan, which could probably be best described as making a lot of noise and creating chaos
He's gonna blame all his failures of Brexit on The EU itself
For the rest, what he does in his own country is of no concern for me
I'd rather just see him and the UK pack their shit and leave the fucking EU already
I'm sick of hearing about this in the news and this shit dragging on and on
&#x200B;
The British voted for the Tories, now deal with the fat cunt it brings forth
Good luck to all
It'll be a bumpy ride
Are you dumb
> their attempt to put the wishes of ~~IRA~~ the Republic of Ireland
Fixed it for you
EU stands with RoI and its demand of a legally binding backstop
If the EU would throw RoI under the bus, every other small member state of the EU will see that if push comes to shove the EU ignores the wish of the smaller state when negotiating with a large external country
D'office not a plan
The big difference with May is that Johnson is powerful in London but unreliable for Brussels, where May didn't have much power in London but was reliable Brussels
Every single Brexit scenario looks absurd at this point, and in every single scenario there will be a power struggle
With government, parliament, tory party, labour party and EU as possible parts of that power struggle
At this point I'm afraid that both the conservative party and parliament are in the weakest position
> pushing the agenda of ~~a terrorist organisation~~ the Good Friday Agreement
Fixed it for you, again
If I was French, I would've said the Louisianna purchase
But in our case, probably the fact that we thought Hitler would respect our neutrality
When we decided forming a country out of 3 national identities was a good idea
That time we had no government for a year
Belgium actually had to remain "perpetually neutral" , as declared in the Treaty of London
It was one of the conditions for Belgium to be recognized as an independent country by the European powers
Yeah, otherwise we'd still be the southern Netherlands
Money isn't really a concern for me but I'm rather cheap and really want to live of €100/month for food once(my meal money I get from my job so I would be eating for "free")
Should check out how I would do that
Atm it's closer to €300
Could save some without really losing any comfort so why not
That's actually a brilliant idea to look at
I'm certainly going to do that
I have aspergers so I have 0 issues eating basically the same thing for a week
If I could find something cheap, that I can make quickly in big quantities and just put in the freezer for an entire week I'm so doing that
I'm Flemish
Moved to Brussels
Got a French girlfriend (not Walloon)
She didn't even know Dutch existed before coming here
I worked at a restaurant for a few years, 100% French
I eat, dream, game, make love and take a shit in French
My mom and sister moved to Holland
We make a lot of fun of each others new way of speaking
Other than that English has always been our second language since my father is Pakistani
As long as I can remember I've had moments where I would use English or Urdu words instead of Dutch
Come to think about it I consider Dutch my first language because it was my schooling language
But I've always had to switch so much between English, Dutch, now French and before Urdu, and then local Limburg dialects for grandparents which is 90% German, other Limburg dialect which is Dutch mixed with Italian and French developed by mine workers immigrants
It depends on the period in my life which language was dominant
Yes
Let's change the lingua franca of Euope once and for all
As for the two countries that have made English the lingua franca in most of the world: the US is a decadent and failing place, and the UK is not even part of Europe anymore

This sometimes confuses me aswell as a Dutch speaker
Uneducated language guy here
How vastly different is Irish from English
Can a native Englishman understand Irish whilst never having learned it and vice-versa
Is Irish taught at school
I’m sorry If I sound very ignorant,
I understood you have your own kind of special alphabet or something like that atleast someone told me that)
I honestly do like my accent, I've practised a lot to get a more neutral accent if I want to but the standard "Flemish" English accent is a sight to behold and always gets a smile on my face
I am from Flanders, which results in us having a pretty unnoticeable accent I think
As a French speaker , I can say that I really don't like it when people (including me sometimes) just speak English with an awful French pronunciation without even trying to have a better accent
On the other hand, when someone try to speak English with a good accent, every other French speaker around will make fun of him
Like he's a "mister-I-do-everything-better-than-you" while he's just trying to be understandable in English
Idk if I made myself clear but I have the feeling that the other French-speaker will understand exactly what I meant
When I talk to native speakers I try to coat it with the American accent I picked up when studying in the US to not be embarassing but other second language speakers I don’t really care does that even make sense
I feel like accents can make it seem like you don’t grasp the language properly enough to understand complex nuances and I don’t want it to influence a conversation/get questions about it I guess
Especially if it’s a professional environment I would rather it not slip out
I really don't like my accent :( I have problems with the R and people think I'm German
Even Germans
(I want to say sorry and offer my sincerest apologies for the quality of my English language skill
For you see, as a child, I spoke Lithuanian as a first language, and at the youthful age of 12 I began to learn English as a second language at the Lithuanian School for English Learners
I understand that the vast majority of Reddit have exemplary ability to read and write English, and I hope that my mere presence has not hindered your ability to enjoy this content on this website
Additionally, as I understand that Reddit is an American website, I hope that I have not misunderstood the American nuances of your language with my comment
Uh yeah
that’s what every Dutch person thinks
Not trying to be insulting I love Dutch accents haha
I'm not an expert in any of this so I can't tell you why the difference is there
But I can tell you my personal reason for using Android
1) Price, this is really the main thing
My phones generally cost around €100-150 ($109-163), you can find a decent smartphone for this price
To me a phone is just not worth $400-1000
Hell no, if I had a 500dollar phone, I'd be scared to use it, totaly nervous that I would accidentally forget it or it would get stolen
Not that I would like to lose my current phone, definitely not
But just price wise $100-150 is not the end of the world for me
It's an unfortunate loss but I can buy a new one immediately without having issues to pay my rent or buy groceries this month
Also I've seen lots of Iphones and Ipads from friends and acquaintances with cracked screens (still operational though)
I have my current phone (fyi Huawei, though I'm not brand loyal) for about 3 years now and I'm sure I've dropped it somewhere between 50 and 200 times
I also can't imagine dropping and cracking a 400-1000dollar phone, my god the guilt I would feel
(I once lost a ring worth 50euros and I felt super guilty, don't worry I found it back almost a year later
2) I'm not used to Apple products
My first phone was a [Sony Ericson] and at home we always used HP computers
I've never been familiar with Apple and I've never found the motivation to learn how to use it (this mainly applies to computers, if I have to use a Macbook for something, half of my time using it is spent on googling "how to ... on a Macbook".)
3) Apple tries to tie you down
From hearing things about Apple left and right, I feel like they really like to tie you down and make you buy only Apple
I really understand this from a marketing standpoint
But as a consumer I immediately have a flight reaction
I like compatibility (both in hard- and software)
Like when I get to someone else's house and my phone is dying
Generally it doesn't matter what brand they have (except for Iphone of course), there's a big chance they'll have the same charging cable and I can just use theirs
You can just pass the charging cable around to about anyone
But no, Iphones need their own specific kind that's not compatible to other phones, really annoying
I've also heard from some Americans (this is anecdotal, not sure how wide spread this feeling is) talk about how they bought an Iphone, only because many of their friends had Iphones and they used the chat app from Iphone that is not available on other phones
If they don't have an Iphone they basically get left out because they can't be part of certain group chats with their friends
Of course this is not purely Iphone's decision, the friends chose to use that app over other available apps
Still I don't like the idea of being forced (or forcing others) into buying a certain brand of phone so they wouldn't feel left out, I like the freedom to choose whatever I want and I want my friends to have that choice too
I really hope that many people keep on buying all different kind of brands and not let one brand monopolize the entire market
As for kids, most of them would definitely prefer to have an iPhone if they could but the price difference is often too big to warrant it
€150 - €300 for a decent latest generation Android phone vs
€700 - €1300 for one of the latest iPhones
Why would you buy an older model iPhone if you could get the latest and greatest stuff (smaller ports, bigger screen & battery) on a new Android phone for the same price
For adults it's even worse
Even though they could afford it, not a lot of them see the same "extra value" in an iPhone that kids do and will just buy a phone with the specs they need for the lowest possible price
Only a handful of them can see an "extra value" in features like face-time and the ecosystem and would go out of their way to buy an iPhone
For me personally it was never about price
But my 450 euro android is doing waaaaaaay better things than an overpriced iPhone anyway
So even if the prices were reversed, I'd buy the android phone
Everytime I post photo's, people ask me what I used to take them, well I used my 'cheap' android
I do have a macbook, it's expensive but for me it's worth it because when I bought it, there was no windows laptop that could top that
Now there are very great windows laptops but I'm used to mac
I would say that Apple is very popular over here, but rather 6/4 instead of 7/3
To me it would make more sense if it wasn't counted based on Android vs
Apple, price-based would be more interesting
And the "poor man's" iPhone/iPad isn't an Android, but that would rather be a 2nd hand iPhone/iPad or a low-end iPhone bought on credit
With Android phones usually you see the same
Top of the line are the flagships, and the poor man's phone will be an old flagship or something that's sold for half the price
People who don't care (no matter how much they have to spend) probably won't spend more than €200-€250 anyways
Reasons
I don't know
As far as I can see it, iPhone is that popular because they are more straight forward to use and for f.i. the chinese competitors people don't even know how to read/pronounce their names
Because Europeans buy products for their quality, not the social status associated with that product
*Snobby android-elitist snickering*
Calling someone gay because he has an iPhone
what
I posted this reply from my moto G!
its because somehow apple manages to uphold this image of being a "fancy" brand, look at the 700$ wheels
with no lock
While absolutely true, a lot of people are very vain about their phones
If it's the only status symbol you can afford and you care about that kind of stuff, you're likely to get it
Charleroi was considered [the ugliest city in the world] at one point
I can't disagree honestly
For Belgium it's probably Doel
Just like Oorderen, Wilmarsdonk and Oosterweel, this village was supposed to be demolished and absorbed by the harbor of Antwerp
Some locals just took the money from the government and moved somewhere else but others put up a fight in an effort to save their village
After the village got mixed messages for years, it's now a ghost town with only a few people still living there
If you ask me, they could've perfectly planned the harbor expansion around the little village
For an actual city though, it'd probably be Charleroi
It was once a wealthy industrial town but is now just a sad and dirty city in the most impoverished part of the country
Many people in my country would probably say Molenbeek, a neighbourhood of Brussels that has seen a lot of immigration during the last decade
It also used to be known as a terrorist hotspot
I have heard it is a really lively neighbourhood though
Also Genk has a bad reputation, and so do many neighbourhoods in Antwerp (Linkeroever etc
I haven't been in any of these towns myself, so I can't really say though
Was looking for this comment
Nah, that's going a bit too far if you ask me
I went to Marseille two years ago and I didn't feel that at all it was actually one of the most pleasant experiences I've had abroad
Non-euclidean is such a horrific and myserious way to say “geometry on a curved surface

I'm from Belgium (Flanders)
The public bus company is terrible here
We just say "De Lijn" (The Line, it's the name of the bus company) and everybody understands
Busses are usually late or just don't show up for no apparent reason
Traffic jams
Train delay/late
Bus delay/late
Traffic what else could it be
Always just the traffic
"The level crossing was closed"
"The bridge was open" (same like in The Netherlands)
"There was a huge 'unexpected' traffic jam" (most of the time caused by roadworks because we're Belgium)
"The road was extremely slippery due to snow
I needed to drive slower" (which most of the time means that there fell less than a centimeter of snow that directly melted)
As a high schooler here in Belgium I tend to go for "the bus was late" which is always true, not  my bus for sure, but a bus was definitely late enough to not be on time
Or I go with "I was biking into the wind"
In Belgium, more specifically West-Flanders it's 'I had to drive behind a tractor the whole way here'
our gloriously messed up traffic of course
especially in antwerp or brussels
There was construction on (insert main road here)
Except this isn't just an excuse, it's just a fact of life when you live in Belgium
De Lijn
Also, what I've heard and uses a lot: "We were behind the garbage truck" Although that may fall under traffic jam
I guess it's a joke
Just smudge your hands by grabbing the chain to make it more real
Never washes off entirely the first time so people'll notice you greasy fingernails
Is this also for if you're invited to someone's house to eat
Here, most people show up like 15 minutes after the agreed hour because showing up too early usually means everything isn't ready yet
if you can really call it a government that is
You misspelled Holland there
Oh okay makes sense

British spelling but I sound quite Midwest due to my ex and her family
I also adapt a bit when speaking
According to my friends it's quite funny, but I hate myself for it
I learned American English at school and you could lose marks if you wrote American or even if you spoke with an American accent
My last 2 teachers however don't care what you use, but you have to use either British all the time or American all the time
And I honestly don't know what is American and what is British
I didn't learn English in school but i had the opportunity to live in the U.S. because of my mother being Spanish/American and i learnt American English (which i think is the best one)
I try to be consistent in whatever I use
My school didn't care what kind you used, as long as it was consistent, so I try to make an effort to speak and write American

This is after a trip to Manhattan and Miami(that one for work mostly)
1) How different women are treated over there
To put it a bit bluntly, they seem more separated in a way
Don't feel all that comfortable with the entire cheerleader thing
Skimpy clothes at a normal cocktail bar
Etc
Just got the feeling that in many situations I saw over there Belgian women would have gone "euh
2) Capitalism everywhere
I'm on a fucking internal flight in the US(Miami - Tennessee) and they're trying to sell shit while I'm on the plane, captive audience much
And again, that basketball game had a ton of other shit going on with people trying to make money
The basketball game seemed like almost an after thought with the amount of prices, games, etc
during the breaks and such
There is simply no peace and quiet to enjoy something you paid for without getting others to try and sell you something
If I compare that to going to a football game in Europe it was a rather big shock
Going to a sports game in the US seems more like a circus
3) The normal food sucks
Yes, I'm sure you can find good stuff
It's just that in most places I've been, there simply isn't much bad food to be found
You go to a B&B and the breakfast is fresh bread and baked goods
In Miami we got croissants packaged in plastic
4) How social everyone is
Problem
I have aspergers
Kindly turn it down
You at the hotel not being able to help me isn't some disaster and I'm not blaming you, not necessary to keep apologizing for it even though the idea of not having what I asked is so stupidly American I still found the situation hilarious
Manhattan was for fun and I'm happy I had a look around but I've seen it now and honestly not a whole lot I enjoyed
The shops are nice, the musical of the Lion King was amazing
Cool, cool
But at the end of the day nothing overly special imo
I don't know, because of historical reasons it just seems that trips to many European countries are more memorable
Seeing the Colosseum is more interesting to me than being on top of the One World Trade Center or whatever it's called and such
While the lower wages here are much higher(found out that an army recruit earns less than minimum wage in the US apparently) I still love just paying my construction workers 1

Eustache, Odilon or Prospeer for males
Colette for females
More or less the same for both French and Dutch
Josefien, Ludovica, Petrus, Frans
mostly Biblical names
Lucille is an old school french name
Jean-Eudes de la rocailles
Gheerwijn, Reinhard, Wolfhard for men
Liedewij, Hadewijch, Adelheid, Adolphine, Mathilda, Pieternel for women
I really wonder why
Esther is not considered an old timey name in Dutch
Odette and Honorine for females
Basically a lot of French names
Hey my grandma was called Odette :)
lol that's a nice way of putting it
But I understand though
After the Dutroux affair, there was a significant drop in newborns named Marc here too
I can see how for Adolf it much much worse
Haha same that's why I said it (same with Honorine)
TOO LATE but better late than never i guess
Let's say math, I know that best in dutch because that's how I was taught
But then I learn entire subjects in English and have an issue translating it in dutch or even begin sentences but notice how I can't nicely finish it in dutch
I think and dream in English
But my work also involves enough other people that my dutch doesn't suffer too much
Not with English, I only get this around Dutch-speaking people
Even though I don't speak with any particular local accent, when I'm in the Netherlands, my Flemish accent suddenly sounds very apparent and weird to me
My biggest problem (native Dutch speaker) is that I'll sometimes think in English, but then don't know how to translate those words/expressions to Dutch (because a lot of the time there isn't a perfect translation)
i sometimes forget dutch words, and when i remember them they for some reason sound weird
At around 16 we were learning more advanced tenses in English here in school and I was fluent in English
People came to me to explain these things
I had no idea
I just went with my gut feeling
Besides Dutch and French, German is also an official language thanks to a tiny part of Germany that we got after WW I.
Julius Caesar once wrote that the Belgians were the bravest cause they lived the furthest away of Roman civilization and were at constant war with Germanic tribes living across the Rhine
In 1990 King Baudoun was declared temporarily unable to reign for about 36 hours
This because he refused to sign the law that liberalised abortion
Belgium has the longest tramway in the world
This 67 kilometer long route is called the  Coast Tram and connects the cities and towns along the entire coast, between De Panne near the French border and Knokke-Heist near the Dutch border
Belgium has the world’s greatest number of castles per square meter
Ive been to Bulgaria with my mom when I was a kid and my mom didn’t speak the language but she understood a fair bit so every time she wanted to answer with a nod or a shake she would just end up making circles with her head and no one understood her XD
If I recall correctly Belgium actually has more castles per km².
Belgium likes to claim Beethoven since his whole family grew up here
His last name is also very Flemish and his father was  famous in Mechelen (Flanders)
Well, French and English have nearly the same structure of sentence, except for the order of adjectives and possessives
And even then, many adjectives in French can be put before the noun like in English
It's why English is very easy to learn for French-speaker natives who don't hate the UK or who don't show the laziness from/of the Francophonie for other languages
So, it isn't very interesting in the case of English spoken or written with the structure of French, because the difference is a bit hard to spot
The oddities main being : the "over-use" of "of" instead of "'s" ("pen of John" instead of "John's pen", and some adjectives put after the noun, such as : the already written "*oddity main*" instead of "main oddity", or "*flower blue*" instead of "blue flower" as other example
As you can see in this comment, I'm quite sure you didn't notice many/much differences with a sentence written in English normal, isn't it
I think not that that funny would be
But it could can work
The results were unsatisfying
These sentences are all typed in the sentence structure of my mother tongue
Seemingly are Dutch and English very similar
Shakespeare sounds often very weirdly Dutch-like in my experience
Reading Macbeth really had me laughing out loud at times
Ah no maybe
The sentence structure in the Finnish is apparently really odd
Thanks for your comment
mmmmh
I think that it a lot from population density depends
We are very bad here doing
Our government is also eh, there
Well yes we have a very interesting government .
Instructions are unclear but we are something new to trying
If that not works are we fucked
Actually six governments, to it easy making have we Flemish speaking community and flanders gewest combined ;)
Yes
Ever since they started building that stadium, years ago, I've stopped buying from the big sponsors that refused to pull out

It's an absolute fraud
FIFA should take it responsibility an reschedule
yes
if they're gonna preach peace and love anytime they speak about football at least stick to your guns
No, because we need to win it and yes, because the situation is not the way to treat someone
If it is against EU regulations, then yes, we should
It's about time the world stops giving Americans special treatments
We only get shit on in return for it
Yes
13,5 - 15,5% really is a big part of the EU, so something should be done about this
In all the time, many countries involved (like Roumania this year) have had the Presidency of the Council of the European Union
No matter what the desired outcome should be, that's where they can discuss
The second level where this could be discussed is via diplomatic routes
But I absolutely don't agree that the desired solution is to santion the usa
I absolutely agree
I never thought I would say this, but the last few years Russia and China have proven to be much more reliable as an alie than the US
Not saying their governments are angels, but at this point there is no world power controlled by a developend set of brains
Regardless of which, Florida needs to be included
Florida man must be kept out of Europe at all costs
Imagine the destruction he'd cause here
This is the first I hear of this
Why are they against it
This indeed seems like a stupid reason for the boycot
You'd think they wouldn't feel this way towards an ally
Yes
Stupid was not a good way to put it
What I mean was that we should work more closely together and that a country's own value isn't always the most important inside an organ like the EU
"That's populism" - Elio DI Rupo (ex-president of the "socialist" party, ex prime minister and current president of the wallon government of belgium) responding to the offer of Raoul Hedebauw (far left politician) to cut government officials salary after mister Elio said they should cut the belgian workers salary to cope with the coronavirus economic repercussion
Probably not the stupidest thing, but still in my memory
Our prime minister Guy Verhofstadt around the 2000s thought it was a brilliant idea to pay off some debts by selling government administrative buildings
But where did all the civil servants go
To the same buildings, which are now in the hands of private companies who demand ridiculously high rent to make a profit
There is a video of my our vice-pm trying and failing to put a face mask
[Here it is
One of our politicians [tried to put on a face mask and failed
r/cirkeltrek liked that moment haha
You forgot the 'Well then we will fix that' at the end
Frituren/friteries closed
The french fries shops being closed (frituur)
We cannot live without our french fries
Apparently, political courage do actually do something about it
Not sure this is the best idea
May I remind you that Nietzsche was German
Not like his metaphysical thoughts ever lead to anything terrible happening
I spent a semester there, Erasmus, so, not in my case no
Everybody here seems well aware of Iceland's existence
I would like to refer to r/mapswithouticeland for proof of the contrary
Well, is long distance train transport still viable
Don’t you think we will first need a change of mentality, to use planes less frequently and instead use trains
I would support it, but I think we should first try to get good high-speed services between more centrally located cities
Only when this region has a robust and reliable network, we should try to expand it to farther regions, assuming that demand for these routes will have increased by then
I'm not saying this should take a long time, we just have to first develop a good model where the infrastructure already exists
(*This is assuming a lot of the funding would come from the EU, otherwise, each country can do whatever it wants
High speed, lower prices, reintroducing sleeper trains
maybe even extra motorail trains
I hope the future of European rail will be as bright as a lot of us want it to be
I would definitely support it
The more high speed trains, the better
I've partially traveled Norway by train last year and it was the most stunning train journey i ever took
We did Oslo-Røros, Røros-Trondheim
Then we stayed there for a week, drove with a rental car do Bergen and then took the train from Bergen to Oslo again
Oh yeah now i know what you mean, i thought you ment a railwaythat connects west EU and east EU
But yeah, i would happely pay taxes for such a project
Oh that’s nice, it would be nice for the climate too i think, cause planes are bad
And if the trains get comfy, with a bar and a restauration cabin, it could become part of the journey
Like the good old days
I would gladly use a train for a day or 2 instead of sitting in a plane for 3 hours all cramped up together
It will cost more tho
I agree, but the standardisation of the european railroads would bring the EU closer together, and if more subsidies went to trains, instead of planes, it would bring some benefits
Yeah but back in the 19th century-early 20th, trains were more comfy, with a bar and all
They were part of the journey
Unlike a plane where you just waste 3 hours untill you get to Your destination
But with long distance trains wouldn’t need to stay in your seat all the time, you should be able walk around, go to the bar
Yeah brussels to nice doesn’t need a bar, but when your journey is a day or more, that wiuld be usefull
And only 9 hours to venice
That’s oretty quick
Well it is purely an individual opinnion
I read basically everything, and will look for Belgians bc I will just comment my experience under theirs
I never see any Belgium people so I feel pretty lonely :(
I have seen them before but only very rarely
products from that company that sells that USB-cable that I accidently clicked on 2 weeks ago on the other hand
I used to get them a lot more but now there are a lot less of them so things are getting better in the world i guess i also remember getting similar ads for south east Asia and south america but they are gone now
Bro
I had no idea
I live in Belgium and even though I knew Russia is financially not so great, I could never imagine this
I really hope there'll be change in the future
Till then, try not to get sick I guess
In the Georgian language, 'siri' means cock/penis
So whenever I'd say 'Hey Siri' my family would look at me in shock
I was initially confused by the term: "**a fortnight**", I thought it was waaay less
* At first I'd imagine it be 4-5 days, as it could stem from "the fourth night" or "five days, four nights". Alas
* Or maybe it's even tonight or tomorrow
As in "the forthcoming night
" Nope
Turns out it's from *fourteen nights*, and it's a term for 2 weeks
Oh well, at least they don't use "fifteen days" like in French
not in english, but frensh has the world "spleen", and the first time I heard it I though it was stolen from english, but it turns out its from french poet Baudelaire
that and someone mentioned the fact that footing (french world for jogging) is not a world in english
Entomology is the study of insects
Autocorrect mistake
By the way, I never interpreted apartheid as otherness, but as separateness in Dutch
In 95% of cases, apart means separately over here
Apart meaning strange is not used very often in Flanders
Speaking of which, I have another language anecdote related to dicks
In Georgian, we pronounce 'dude' this way : 'katso', which sounds exactly like the Italian word 'cazzo' (penis)
My uncle was in an Italian restaurant talking to his friend in Georgian like : 'Dude, forreal, I was just
blablabla, dude
Everyone in the restaurant was like wtf
Overmorgen in Dutch
That would be correct
Yes, but when you say 'English' you don't think of the US, do you
Yet I'm assuming you have the largest amount of English speaking population
Yeah I meant it as 'I am English' and 'I am Spanish'.
Maybe it's because the US is more aware of England than Spain
Summers on the other hand are like being in Satan’s buttcrack we got like 39 degrees for a while its absolutely not normal and very worrying
Same
The last time we got real snow where I live was like
3-4 years
Didn't we get a decent amount of snow last winter
I remember it was a real pain in the ass with all the snow for getting to my exams on time
Not really no
We had some snow, but nothing that didn't immediately melt
Last time we had some snow that stayed for at least a couple of days was 4 years ago IIRC
When I was a child (10 years ago or so) we had snow that stayed for about a week once r twice a year
Do you still live in Greece
In my mind Greece us way too hot to ever have any snow but since you seem to recall it, I must be mistaken
Occasionally, when a German tourist is being a dick, people would say "fucking German tourists" but there's no hostility towards Germans any more for the WWII thing, especially not among younger people
Germans are actually often seen as hard working and efficient people
"Oh it's made in Germany
It's probably good quality then"
I'd say it isn't a thing anymore in Belgium
However, when I told my grandmother a few years ago that I was going to Germany on holiday, I saw her tense up for a split second and look at me warily
She was a teenager during the war and still remembers it vividly
That aside, she would never be rude to someone from Germany or mention it
Belgian here
No anti-German sentiment, but I do expect a lot from Germany as a country
WW1 and WW2 has caused immesurable suffering to my country and my family - many of my ancestors fought in both wars and didn't survive
I feel that it is Germany's duty now to be the champion of the EU and European unity
And I do feel they are showing leadership and solidarity, which is good
I also like that Germany doesn't shy away from its dark past and that it acknowledges and highlights the horrid mistakes from the past
That shows a collective maturity that many individuals don't even possess
Most of our train are either made in Germany or designed in Germany so yeah !
Europe really doesn't hate Germany
Perhaps certain individuals, mostly older people
Time heals all wounds, WW2 is still fairly recent
It will pass
Wait how happen that they are late then ?
The clothes brand "diesel" is italian and not american
Was convinced that La Trappe beer was either Belgian or French, but definitely not Dutch
still very good though :)
No problem my friend ,you can say the truth
It is apparebtly indeed French, but Belgium is the country with the biggest fries tradition
They're just a lot better here
How can it seem so Spanish with a French name
Roland sounds French though
"Too big" isn't sweden and finland the same size of germany
Megan fox i think(becaus the phone changes to a robot) i am not sure it is long ago
Can you translate it because my french sucks
sorry
And the things we eat with them at our "frietkot" is also just very Belgian
What is the Spanish word for carrefour/crossroad in Spanish
I had classes of Spanish in high school and university, but haven't used the language in/since years
Is there a possibility the french goverment paid the guy to lie
I like salt on my belgian fries, that is true
Sorry i don't understand what you mean, explain pleas
Is it about the world cup
This is my opinion, you won, the goals where real goals so no problem but these  last 5 minutes though(you saw mbappe and neymar are teammates)
Since that moment all Belgians hate Mbappe lol
What an asshole
No surprise the whole country supported Croatia
Yeah, unfortunaly they lost but i have still a lot of respect for their national team
Same, imo they played better except for like 10 minutes when France scored twice
Even Giroud, France's attacker, stayed at 30 meters from his own goal for basically the whole game
Maybe use the funds they get from taxes and instead of bombing other countries, you could use it to help your own people
Both would be more difficult as taxes will rise
From our pov, the US system is expensive if you have health insurance and disgusting if you don't (or if you got tricked by your insurer)
There are plenty of examples in Europe that prove it can be done better
Will any of our systems work in the US, just copy paste
Probably not
A lot of stuff would need to change, and changing stuff as vital as healthcare could lead to short term massive disruptions, causing a lot of harm
However, if your politicians know what they are doing, meaning if they listen to the god damn experts, it is possible to gradually work towards any type of system they want
It doesn't even have to be federal
What still slightly boggles my mind is why there still isn't bipartisan support for anything
In Belgium, all parties from far left to far right agree that our current system is something good that should be preserved
Some parties may think there is room for improvement of efficiency and (naturally) want to cut the budget, forcing the industry to grow more efficient or suffer problems (more likely outcome)
Others want to expand the budget, lowering the price for the patients even more, eventhough that might not be financially sound for the state
But somewhere in the middle is an optimal point
The art is to find it and stay near it
Some specific costs details for medical treatments: (each country has different laws and systems) . For western europe (belgium in my case):
In case of sickness (flew or something) basicly everything is covered
A basic doctors visit will cost you +-28 EUR (could be wrong) for a checkup and is almost fully payed back
Today with some doctors, they have a system where the bill is automaticly send to the insurance company and you don't have to pay anything
And the any little remaining costs that might remain will be charged instantly by the insurance company
Prescription drugs are fully payed back, non prescription drugs are not payed back
&#x200B;
A hospital treatment is for the largest part payed back
The poorest people don't have to pay anything
Everything together of these extra costs will never cost more than what somebody can afford
People never ever need to (or very rarely )  pay of a long lasting debt due to hospital treatments
For regular and high income people **things that are not payed back** (or only limited) are:
Accommodation costs: Costs for your stay such as use of room and bed, meals and nursing assistance
You only pay a small personal share in the daily price
But if you chose a single room, you will also be charged a room supplement
Fixed costs: The hospital may charge part of the costs per admission with a fixed amount
Pharmacy: Costs charged by the hospital's pharmacy, for example for medicines, implants and medical devices
Professional fees: The fees for doctors and other healthcare providers for which you have to pay a personal share or supplement
The supplement may only be charged if you chose a single room
choosing to be treated by a doctor/professor of your choice
Other deliveries: Costs for blood products and plaster materials, among other things
Patient transport: Costs for non-urgent transport
Miscellaneous costs: Non-medical costs such as additional room comfort and requested drinks
aesthetic procedures: aesthetic (plastic) benefits such as breast augmentation
European countries took a long time to get healthcare right, but had each other to learn from
I think Americans expect the government to implent a fully functional healthcare system by tomorrow
In that case you can only rush things and you will never get things right
For a country as big as the US it might take years if not decades just to get the reoroganisation right
And with a government as unstable over long periods as that of the US that's going to be hard task
Many European countries have universal healthcare but barely any of them have _single payer_ healthcare
Many work with a private insurance model
So as everybody here only mentions the good side i would also like to share some of the negative aspects
(I'm all for universal healthcare, but differences will allways exist, and a perfect system doesn't exist
In belgium there are 2 types of hospitals
There are university hospitals and private hospitals
One of the biggest differences is how a doctor wants to pursue a career
In university hospitals you will have to engage in academic research rather then solely medical ttreatments (professor vs doctor)
Overal a professor gets a higher pay and higher respect from coleagues
However that doesn't mean a professor is smarter/better then a doctor, but if you want to earn more you will have to pursue an academic career also
So in university hospitals if you want to make more money (without doing academic research) you will have to go work at a private hospital
These pays can be better, but it also means you can open a private practice should you want that
In a university hospital it is a bit more difficult to open a private practice parallel to your job as a professor/doctor in a university hospital
University hospitals tend to loose good doctors that don't want to pursue an academic career
Another negative thing (depends on which hospital and which area ) is the waiting times for non emergency situations
Another thing is insurance companies will rarely sue hospitals or complain why the bill is not consistent or when they believe the bill is too high ... bc everything is state supported financially
This at the same time also is beneficial as hospitals themselves are less afraid of being sued and don't need more expensive insurances themselves
But it also means that the goverment will have a harder time tracking costs
Bad idea
People who refuse to work like cleaning hospitals, shouldn't be entitled to get the services
The issue is that America is still very beneficial for rich people, causing a brain drain
Most PhD graduates in the USA aren't American, for instance
We shouldn't aim to make a system where America's poor go into the world, and the world's wealthy go to America
Same for any other country
Porque no los dos
The end of a costly war + communist threat = a real possibility for a communist uprising
So appease your workers with some democratic socialist policies like cheap healthcare and strong social security
Happened twice in Belgium
After WW1, lots of stuff came through
After WW2, same thing plus women finaly got to vote
and that should be corrected, it's a shame
In EU it should also be changed
Not everyone who works has the hospitalisation insurance
Both in the workforce and the army, the numbers become less relevant
Very common
I always drink tap water but I also know people that refuse to drink tap water for some reason
I have a filter on a separate faucet and only basically drink that
But I'm cheap
The idea of paying for drinks is just dumb imo when you can get it for (nearly) free
Overall I think most buy bottled still water
Bottled water is considered fancier and is given to guests
Very common
Even our sparkling water can now be tap water thanks to Sodastream
in belgium people just drink trap water, and those who drink bottled water either do so out of habit or because they want to drink water on the way
the exceptions are some villages in wallonia with really old water pipes, resulting in some metals going in the water
you can still shower with that water though, just don't drink it
i was in france, and in some cities the water is perfectly drinkable but doesn't taste that good, so i drank bottled water
>Also, unlike in other countries, our bottled water is not just tap water put in a bottle, it has to be collected directly from a spring
I thought all bottled water must be collected from a spring
At least this is the case in Belgium and it doesn't change the fact that we usually drink tap water (which is very hard)
in belgium too :D
Yeah I experienced this when visiting the US
I allways drink bottled water because I don't like the taste of tap water where I live, but a lot of American bottled water tastes just as bad
I learned to look specifically for spring water instead of purified water but I still don't get why someone would buy tap water in a bottle
Always 'that makes no sense´ bcs you can say ´that makes no ´ in dutch but sense hasn't a translation so then youre stuck
Just one hour ago I was reading in a French book that I have to read for French (as always the topic really doesn't interest me), and I saw *alumettes*. I know what they are
I could translate it to English (matches, like the kind you use to light up candles)
For the life of me I couldn't translate it to Dutch
I looked it up, and had a "of course"-moment when translate told me it was *lucifer*.
No you can say that but not if you already st1rted with ´that makes no ´ bcs the ordr of the words is wrong then
Yeah but I meant that when you are already saying 'dat maakt geen
' you have to start over
Same in Flanders
Sometimes we use the Dutch word, sometimes the French word and sometimes the English word
French is mostly used for car mechanics and bicycles, English for more modern technology
Serve beer in the wrong glass
Everybody hates it when this happens
Saying that waffles represents our country
We like waffles as much as the next man but we'll drop a waffle in a split second for a Jupiler with some fries and mayo
Saying hello to anybody on the street and/or looking friendly at them
They will assume you want something or want to mug them
The Flemish part of Belgium is very very very conservative in that sense
And even if you do one of these things, they will look at you as if you're a murderer
I am so glad that I knew this before spending 6 months on exchange in France
>I don’t know how to add that cool flair thing
Go to the sub, press the 3 dots in the upper right corner and press 'change user flair' if you're on mobile
As a Belgian person I use both Holland(er) and Nederland(er)
But generally when I'm talking to a Dutch person I use 'Nederland(er)'. I've noticed that it really annoys some Dutch people when you say 'Holland'. But then again I've met Dutch people that did not care at all and even ones who use 'Holland' themselves
I generally just play on the safe side
Or beer without/to little foam, you are a barbarian if you do that
In Brussels I have been served a 6€ Duvel in a plastic glass once
Did you pay
Yeaahhhhh sometimes it do be like that hahaha
But when you're an extrovert, it's not the best thing to have all around you lol
It's not a huge difference but Belgians are definitely a bit more reserved
Haha no problem
Yes, a joining together does not seem like a good idea
Better a good neighbor with different habits than a housemate with different habits
Starting june 13 2010 we didn't have a government for 541 days
Currently we are without a federal government since the 26 may 2019
Fingers crossed for a new record
Last, I dont know
But we still have the record of country without government for the longest period of time
Here, more people speak Arabic than German
Technically, we do have a federal government at this time, so the new record wouldn't count for the guniness book of world records (yes, it's actually in there)
Portugal and Finland are somewhat similar, both have one win, but never finished top 5 outside of that victory
In that case the first shouldn't count neither because we had a government of running affairs "Leterme II". That one had the same democratic value as the current Wilmes I.
Could you imagine the outrage if that would happen
Vlaams Belang would get a majority on its own
Mercyful Fate is one of the biggest traditional heavy metal bands even
I once walked through a Belgian park with a german exchange student
We came across a big group of statues of people, and he asked what it was about
It was a bit awkward when I told him it commemorated the martyred civilians who were killed by the Germans in WWII, as revenge for some action by the Belgian resistance
Well actually, I was surprised he didn't feel weird about it, as I did
He explained how he regards it as something the Nazis did, separate from what Germans are (which is true I suppose)
Whereas we've always joked about the Germans as the enemy  invaders
Not in a malicious way, but rather like when you hear a loud bang, or see some old planes flying, someone will joke 'to the defenses, the Germans are back
It keeps the memory more alive I think
Edit with literal line: 'Luchtafweergeschut
Den Duits is daar
' (Anti-aircraft artillery
The German is there
Can't blame people today for things that happend nearly 100 years ago
So I don't think so
Europe has been a war zone for thousands of years
To me it seems that it's all seen as "history", and not related to today's countries
Apart from nazi Germany, most wars aren't seen as good vs evil, but just a very long list of power hungry rulers
This way we can work together without resentment
Balkan wars are too recent for the anger to have subdued
Unfortunately, nationalistic parties have been using old wars to instill hatred towards anything foreign
I'm Belgian-Moroccan of Amazigh heritage, I guess it's kinda related to European history but contemporary Moroccans still make jokes about the Ottoman empire conquering most of North Africa except for our country, I brought this up to a Turkish friend of mine and he found it hilarious
Not really, since the *country* of Belgium does not have much war crimes or bad history, except the Congo
As Belgians we don't really feel sensitive with this subject, but African people here instantly say that the entire country is bad and the money should be returned etc
I feel second hand embarrassed
Jesus chrost
Have the Russians ever attacked the Netherlands
War is a story about people after all as much as it is about nations and ideologies
The jude law movie
my guess would be food and weather
both in terms of health and happiness
sun and pasta, no depression, happiness forever
Our country is the definition of bad weather, stress and depression
i agree, as long as a british person doesnt enter the chat :D
We have the 100-dagen/50-dagen (100 days)
The last 100 days of secondary school, the last graders dress up in some funny costume and party in the school
It’s a bit different from school to school, but our theme was farm land so everyone dressed up as farmer/animal, we had hay all over the school ground and even inside the school building, we made a farmer decor for the hallways etc
For the teachers room, we made memes about our teachers and displayed them over there
The night before and after, people go partying so usually they arrive at school drunk
Then school gave us breakfast and we went to do karaoke
In the afternoon you have to clean up and then after that you can party again
Our school had a farm and on 100 dagen we released 2 pigs in the hallways, #1 and #3
In Belgium we don’t do something before taking exams but you do something related to your final 100 days in high school
At my school this started on the thursday night when you go out and party
During this night students do some stuff to their school
We let 4 chickens loose in the building and sprayed 1,2,4,5 on their back so the teacher would lose their mind to find nr 3
These pranks used to be next level, but seniors the year before us basically vandalised the school (ductaping firecrackers on the inside of a toilet and basically destroying 5-6 toilets) so the principal decided to sleep in school and make sure nothing serious would happen
After that you would go to school on friday morning and do all kinds of activities (we got breakfast, physical test to prove you’re not still drunk, ‘fancy’ lunch and then go bowling)
After that you have a parade through the city of your school where all the seniors have to dress up and parade through the town
After this parade the town organises another party
We have Chrisostomos, 100 schooldays before the end of the year, the people from the last year have something, in most of the schools they do pranks I think, in others real shows but they are all drunk
In Belgium (Flanders at least) we have 100 dagen (100 days)
It's a day where the people who are in their last year of secundary school can go nuts
They don't have any lessons that day and they all go dressed as something/someone crazy and use water guns to shoot on all the other students that aren't in their last year
In my school it's the day before eastern break
They order a bouncy castle to play on, they block the entrance of the school with a whole parcour and they  can do anything (that is reasonable) with some of the teacher's classes
(Like filling one with hundreds of balloons, or sticking newspapers on literally all walls, desks, chairs
and so much more)
This year it's my turn and I'm so fucking excited
It's probably the most fun day of your whole school carrier by then

This year it's my turn and I'm so fucking excited
It's probably the most fun day of your whole school carrier by then
We had a full week to dress up with a different theme each day
We also had to clean up before getting breakfast
Then we went paintballing
at our school, we have a whole week of dressing up, cantus and party ending with flashmob-ish acts for the whole school to enjoy next week will be "keihard knalleuh"
No such thing in Wallonia
Mad
Sint pieters college
In my school a month ago or so
I really miss that day
where I live they do the 50 days, somewhere in April or so

The only Belgian French accents I ever heard, was in a satyrical comedy with an over the top accent
And it was fun
Never heard a non native try to speak Flemmish
In Wonder Woman she talks to a woman in Belgium so normally she would speek Dutch or french or German but instead they speak this messed up thing that sounds a very little bit like Dutch but it’s like totally translated with google translate
[This scene by Anne Hathaway in "The Hustle" comes to mind] I can understand it if I pay close attention to it but when I first heard it in theaters I literally did not understand a word of what she was saying
At least some of them nail it
(I can watch that scene over and over)
That is exactly what came to mind for me
I mean, since the movie is set in World War 1 it wasn’t a surprise to me it would end up taking place in Belgium
But to then suddenly hear someone speak with a perfect Flemish accent was a welcome surprise
And then they switched to Peter walking through a field of tulips with a windmill in the background
They really wanted to tick off all the boxes
Just missing the weed/coffee shops and some dikes
There's also 2 windmills in the background of the market and a windmill on each side of the tulip field
holyshit that scene is disgusting
do they think everyone in the benelux is still in "de jaren stillekes"
yea its so weird, i'm not even a native french speaker but we obviously get it in school and lots of french in movies just sounds like bad high school french
It's not a real interview
It's from the Flemish sketch show In De Gloria
Generally yes, unless we see it's Dutchmen
Then we say it in French
In Belgium it's the tradition to spit in you palm and high five each other when you meet on a mountain
Luckily we don't have mountains here
Well I mean we don't really have mountains here, but we're all apathetic as hell so I don't really think we would
We do say hi in bars and the chip shop, so that's something
u/joelhelg :Flag-xx: Custom location is being plagued by a terrible civil war at the moment
You'll have to visit later, my friend
Coincidence that this was posted on December 6th
(Sinterklaas in the Netherlands and Belgium)
Eating horse meat is considered crazy abroad I guess
I'd guess that'd be the fact we eat raw meat, I've seen people lose their mind when I tell them that it's normal to eat prepared minced meat, aka an american steak which is raw meat and no its not american, i really dunno why it is named as such
It's not exclusive to belgium though, the netherlands does that too and as well Germany
I saw it once in Edinburgh, I thought I was being scammed first when asked
Well blackface is one that comes to mind this time of year
I don't know if it's that uncommon in other countries, but eating fries at least once a week
[Dutch Super Mom in action]
Also applies to Belgium
Basically countries where it's transport people aren't wearing a helmet
Countries where it's an activity they're more likely to do so
It's common here which is no surprise of course
No, it's the common way to say hello in Belgium too
With just one "kiss" though, not two
Also in Belgium, makes me think that all these comments from the Netherlands also in apply in Belgium lol
I've heard there are police jobs in the US that require you to live nearby
As a result the beginning wage is over 100k.
I guess it kind of makes sense, you need people there who do these types of jobs as well and if you pay them a normal wage nobody would ever show up to do them
Well he pays us a visit during the night between the 5th and 6th
Fun fact, in some parts of Belgium it's three kisses (can confirm unfortunately)
US and UK seem to be more averse to it than other Western countries
I didn’t know that, thanks
Yea, doing a cousin marriage once isn't going to lead to deformities
We would be extinct as a species if it did
The problem is if you do it over many generations
Cargo bikes (wheelbarrow bike) are expensive
Decent models easily cost a few thousand euros
I don't get why she hasn't taught the kids to ride for themselves though
I'm bad at guessing kids ages but 2 of them look at least 6 if not older, a normal age to ride in traffic themselves in the Netherlands
Really
Where
Where I am in Belgium (Brabant wallon) we find the 2 of the French already odd, I can't imagine 3 !
Yeah, is that weird
Here it’s legal to drink beer and such at 16
Stronger drinks like whisky or jenever or anything like it is allowed at 18
I live in Limburg (in the north), so maybe it's because we live close to the Netherlands
If I'm not wrong they do 3 kisses there
Although if we meet up with friends of my parents who live in the south of Limburg, we do 3 kisses as well so maybe it's just in Limburg in general, no idea
How is one more intimate than two
To me 2 or 3 seems much more intimate, since the contact is longer
I have heard that Limburg has its own kind of culture indeed, quite different from historical Flanders, and "new Flanders" (Brabant and Antwerpen, which weren't part of the county/duchy of Flanders)
How true is that
Is it that different
I personally don't notice a big difference, obviously another dialect but I guess that's it
I see, well, here the "kiss" is not really a kiss, it's a "cheek-on-cheek", we don't use the lips, so
Using the lips is only with partner, or maybe family
Zalig kerstfeest en een gelukkig Nieuwjaar
Joieux Noël et bonne année !
For some reason I can only think of stuff that has to do with the Chinese right now, eventhough I'm sure we have expressions with other countries too
\*'Chinese vrijwilliger '(a Chinese volunteer): someone who's forced to do something even if they don't want to
Generally in the context where no one (out of a group) wants to do something/no one wants to volunteer, so a 'Chinese volunteer' is chosen
In my experience it's generally used when no-one voluntarily answers in class or if someone has to do an annoying chore
\*'Met alle Chinezen, maar niet met den dezen
' (With all the Chinese, but not with this one): used when you feel like someone is trying to fool you or trying to convince you (of something that is not true) and you want to tell them that you're not that gullible/stupid, they won't fool you
So I guess Chinese here probably refers to 'a lot of people', like you might be able to fool a lot of people but not this one (me)
\*'Dat is Chinees voor mij' (That's Chinese to me): Basically we use Chinese instead of Greek (That's Greek to me)
We call that splitting the bill instead of going Dutch
I never heard that expression before
Roken als een turk= smoking like a turkish guy, you say it when you see a person smoking a lot of sigarets
Huh, I always figured "going dutch" was because the Dutch have a tendency to be frugal/cheapskates
'Spaanse furie' (Spanish fury) is one that comes to mind
It's an expression used to refer to someone who has no control over their anger and emotions
It traces back to a series of bloodbaths inflicted by mutinying Spanish soldiers during the Eighty Years' War, most notably the [Sack of Antwerp]
Roken als een Turk = To smoke like a Turk = smoking a lot
Joke or not
Going Dutch means drinking with 2 straws from the same drink at a bar to save a bit of money here in Belgium
I really hate to say this but if it stays like this for long sanctions should be imposed on Hungary or they should be kicked out of the EU
Only democracies are allowed, that has always been the case (That's why Liechtenstein isn't part of the EU e.g.)
I really hope that something changes and the hungarians realise this is not the way
Good luck over there
Some older people in West Flanders, if they speak their dialect can be hard to understand
Younger people tend to speak a cleaner version of the dialect
I when people from West-Flanders are speaking to me, I'm always wondering what they actually say
Everyday life here in Belgium
If someone's gonna start talking rough West-Flemish, dear lord I am not gonna understand a single thing they're saying
This happens all the time if i leave my home town belgium has many dialects
Honest to God, I've got no idea who began the "neuken in de keuken" thing or why it sticks
I've literally never heard the phrase being said by anyone expect people who don't speak Dutch
And I can't understand dialects from the north of the Netherlands and I have trouble understanding Limburgish
Like Aya Nakamura, I don't understand anything about her lyrics
Yeah some are Low Saxon
But tbh, I even have trouble understanding someone speaking Standard Dutch if they have a really thick Dutch accent
I can understand that perfectly
Idk but I've had some cases where I couldn't understand people even though they were speaking Standard Dutch
In Belgium, they tell you you'll be cleaning up the s\*\*\* behind the train
I don't know where this comes from, as I haven't heard anything about human excrements just being disposed of on the tracks
My parents used to say I should study well, or become a guy that picks up the shit falling from the trains
Old trains in Belgium didn't have a septic tank an everything was just dumped on the tracks
There was even a rule you could not use the train toilets when stopped in a station for this reason
I highly doubt this was ever a real profession, but the threat was quite effective
I think it's that you'll work in the Panos or the Colruyt
(This is coming from a Leuvenaar) Colruyt is one of the biggest supermarket-chains in Belgium and Panos is something kind of like Subway
.. or you'll be collecting horse shit behind the tram
That must have been going for multiple generations now
I have no idea when the last horse tram stopped working over here
We used to say "straatveger" in Dutch which is a street cleaner or "ramasseur de poubelles" in French which is a garbage man
But I don't use that comparison, because cleaners and garbage men are just as important to society as any other job
I'm against job shaming, unless your job is instagram influencer or some useless fuckery like that
Same, my dad woke up with me at 6 am on a vacation in spain to look at the garbage truck passing by
That we don't all speak
German
Yes, German
I was in London last year with my school
6 people asked from where we were and when we said Belgium, 4 of them said: "Oh so you speak French
" and 2 of them said: "Oh so you speak German
" We're from a school in Flanders so we all speak Dutch
We are not French and Dutch people put together
And even if they helped, we aren't a creation of the British
A lot of people seem to think that the only language spoken in Belgium is French
I've even had a German telling me that - when hearing me speak Dutch - I should stop speaking fantasy languages
She didn't mean it to be denigrating, she *actually* thought I was speaking a made-up language
Some folks think that we aren't a country
So I tried to explain them that we are
But I had to dig in so deeply in to the subject that I had to conclude that we might not be a country
I mean we still don't have a (functional) federal goverment ... .
Total confusion about what Brussels and/or Belgium are, I've seen many forms of: brussels is the capital of europe, belgium is a country in Brussels (???), shit like that
When we get to the topic of governments and languages it's basically hopeless haha
Every american thinks we all speak French, when Flemish (Dutch dialect) is actually the dominant language, this includes most american redditors I've seen talking about the topic
That it was us Belgians that invented fries
It's weird that so many people think the French did (probably doesn't help that the Americans call them ”French fries”)
Ok, that's even dumber than my story
Spanish in Switzerland lol
Less than 1% of the population (only about 70,000 people) has German as a mother tongue
Yes, but it’s less than 5%
Your citoyenneté has now been revoked
Liam Neeson IS Zeus
Have you never seen Clash of Titans
Yup that pretty much sums it up
They publish an official dictionary every year adding "new" words but no one gives a shit not even french teachers
Learn some history and get out your Dutch bias
Belgium as a concept is older than the Netherlands, even if its independence is more recent
The whole low countries area was called Belgica
If anything, it's the Dutch that are Belgians, and not the other way around
And Walloons only spent 20 years under France, they have barely no common history with it, since they were part of the Holy Roman Empire
During Roman time yes, but not during the Middle-Age : [Leo Belgicus]
I support mandatory vaccinations for dangerous illnesses
Idc if you got a flu shot or not, but please stay away from me if you didn’t get vaccinated against polio
Edit: obviously exceptions should be made for people who, for medical reasons, cannot be vaccinated
Mandatory vaccination should be a must
Anti-vaxxers are as dumb as the flat Earth crowd
I dont give a shit about your beliefs
We dont want kids to carry diseases we know we can prevent
I also read vacation 2 times
Vacation is already mandatory in Belgium btw, or at least paid vacation days are mandatory
There I’d make it mandatory for older people and young kids, and people who often get in contact with them (teachers, nurses etc)
I personally don’t think literally everyone should get a flu shot
I Belgium I don’t think it is aloud to not take your vacation and rather get paid a premium
At least I have never heard of such a thing here
I don’t think flu shots should be mandatory but I think they should be recommended
My job offers free flu shots every year and I always get one
Even if the flu is less dangerous for me
Herd immunity is still a thing, I will be less likely to infect someone who couldn’t survive a bad flu virus
I also get one every year, I’d rather prevent than cure it :)
I like that one
There are a lot lot more party destinations
Some
of them skanky some of them not
Having been to ibiza for many years in the 90s and also now recent years
Ibiza has become some sort of 'upscaled' expensive version of a party island
It is also the only one where there is also a monaco type of jetset
And also a celebrity hotspot (sportstars, popstars)
Because it is so much more expensive, it filters out some types of malbehaving tourists
Mykonos is also an upscale party destination that has done it's effort of losing a possible negative image
Magaluff is known for being the skankiest most dirty party destination
There , local authorities are cracking down on bars and places to try to find violations
Local authorities tried working together with british police officers to try and stop malbehaviour of british tourists
(Overal people feel most malbehaviour comes from brits and germans)
Thank god for friends with pools because I am not made for any weather above 25 degrees without being in the immediate surrounding of a pool
After the last 2 summers I have airconditioning everywhere and I work from home so I'm good :p.
It's the third day that it's about 30 degrees here (for a Belgian that is considered hot, I don't have air conditioning or electric fans)
I'm happy it's going to cool down from tomorrow onwards
The way I coped:
Day one was pretty easy
I cooled off my apartment at night and in the morning
Then at around 8am I shut all the windows and in my room (where I wasn't spending any time during the day) I even closed the curtains
My windows are facing North, which is very unfortunate during most of the year, but on these days it really does help
Only around 17-20pm I get a few slivers of sunlight in the apartment
So the temperature was really okay when I was working at home, only towards the evening I was overheating a bit
Day 2, same scenario
Cooling it off at night as much as I can, shutting everything at 8am
It was a bit warmer than day 1 but still very bearable until the evening
Today was a lot more difficult, I had all my windows wide open at night, but I didn't feel like it cooled down at all
So today was a lot hotter to live through
I don't have many other tips except for, drink a refreshing drink (from the fridge or with ice cubes) and I also use a plant spray bottle
I mainly put it next to my bed and when I get into bed or sometimes when I wake up at night, I spray some water in the air and let it fall on me
It's a really nice cooling feeling, it only lasts for like half a minute, but it's still very helpful I feel
Yesterday I had to study for my history exam (if you can even call it an exam) but it was so hot that I had difficulty’s with just concentrating and staying focused
its ehhh yea, we're baking
and then i'm in a hot kitchen at work wearing a mask, its great
I felt so lethargic in the two last days from just waiting in the living room that the heat is over
Now it's over ! It went down to 24°C and tomorrow will be max 21°C.
Calling the cops on them is
probably somewhat insensitive at the moment, I presume
It was fine
I could easily answer the first half of the exam
The other half was a bit harder but I still made it
And thanks for asking
Most of us find that if its lunch/dinner time its so busy and stressful that its not so big of a problem/dont notice it too much
Have a towel nearby to wipe sweat and go outside for 10 seconds when we can haha
I advise putting all windows open at night and then close them in the morning
Then keep the curtains, doors and windows closed all day
You’re absolutely right
Stay safe out there :)
We had the same problem but now we use these screens in front of windows with tiny holes to small for insects (I don't know what it's called in English)
I think they're called window screens or bug screens
I'm extremely thankful to the person who invented those
Depends on which country but I think it's less useful to have permanent screens if you live in a country where it's not warm enough to leave open your doors and windows most of the year
Screens take away from your hopefully beautiful view and it stops you from putting your head/hand (whatever bodypart) out of the window
Though many people I know have some type of removable screen that they can put in certain windows in their house or sliding doors during hot days
You could ask this question in r/Askhistorians possibly
Be aware it is a heavily (but well-) moderated sub
Massive french centralization did that pretty much
Rural france is ghost towns by ghost towns because everyone left those towns as it's just shitty to live there without infrastructure as everything is based on the big cities of France, the rest are literally ignored by the french state
Well, in my opinion the moderation is very well done on that sub
The rules are clear and always followed, it's just that they are very strict
Which I get
They, as is natural for historians, rely heavily on sources (as should happen more imo)
They do not allow any unsourced answer, and they only allow credible sources as well
I think it's a good policy
You go to that sub for a professional opinion of a historian
Not someone who thinks they know the answer because they heard someone say it some time ago
Omg yes
You could turn it into a sub and just post them so it feels like it's the woman herself writing it directly to us, if that makes sense
"Belgians are born with a brick in their stomach
" Alluding to the fact that every single Belgian seems to want to buy or build their own house and keep renovating it during their lifetimes
Een baksteen in de maag, translated to "born with a brick in the stomach" at least in Flanders, because we like to build our own house
It is said we have a "brick in our stomach" because we like to build stufd, decorate, rearrange our interiors, etc
We say that Belgian people are born with a brick in their stomach
Very true from my experience
My father built his own house (he actually did a lot of the manual work himself)
Most of my aunts/uncles bought ground and built a house on it
And the few who bought an existing house still did or are planning to do a big rennovation
And even when the house is 'done' (like it ever really is) then there's still a shed to build, the terrace, carport etc
Of course this depends on the finances of people
Most of my family is doing financially alright so they can affort to buy ground/house and on top of that, it was 15-30 years ago when those  things were already more affordable
I have a few people my age (20"s-30's) in my family who are now buying a house or looking into buying a house
And the houses they can afford are easily half or one third the size of the houses of the generation of my parents/aunts/uncles
Eventhough job-wise they don't have lower paying types of jobs than my parents etc had when they bought ground/a house
To protect yourselves against the vampires in your country I guess
Yeah because making thing with your hand is fun
My parents always need a "goal", often that is renovating something at the house
When we bought the place I think it took like 3 years before our yard was in any decent shape
I've removed wooden planks placed in their yard not 9 months earlier
What I've heard said about Belgian cuisine is the quality of french cuisine with the volume of German cuisine
For me personaly belgian
but my french and german is not good
(because i am from west vlaanderen some flemisch people gona say my flemisch is also not good)
Ps sorry for the bad english
It's all relative
In Belgium, I feel Brusseleir
In Europe, I feel Belgian
In the world, I feel European
I feel Belgian, I never say I'm Flemish, don't like it
But as always with Belgium it's complicated: Feeling Flemish in this day and age often goes supporting the Flemish independance parties NVA en Vlaams Belang
But indeed, when abroad you say Belgium, however a lot of people, especially outside Europe, don't know it sadly enough
Belgian first
Edit: Walloon second
Edit: Is there a joke that i'm not getting
Basically I don’t feel Belgian or Flemish
I’m West Flemish and I’m proud of it
Personally I have no feeling with any other part in Belgium
We have the sea, nature, the best dialect in the world and the prettiest city in Belgium
The only thing we don’t have is a university, and that’s why West Flemish people are colonising Ghent
I guess Belgian, then Flemish, but that doesn’t mean I feel any affinity with Wallonia
I'd say I'm a European first and foremost
Second I'm Belgian
Even though I don't agree on a political level with my fellow countrymen, they are my countrymen and we share a great deal
There is a divide in some way
I personally feel more attracted to being Flemish
Reason being that the Belgian part has trouble getting a goverment together
Don't get me wrong I would love to feel proud to be Belgian, and I have no issue with the people of Wallonia
I just wish our politicians could keep the country together instead of ripping it apart
I feel Belgian
I feel very belgian, but Wallonia is a place with grumpy, unemployed people
For flemish people they mostly feel more flemish but for walloon people they feel more Belgian I think
I'm a bit of an odd one, because I feel Brabantian* (being born in a town of Brussels and grew up in walloon Brabant, all formerly part of the Duchy of Brabant) and Belgian, then Beneluxian, and then Indo-European
**Wallonia and Flanders are modern constructs, that really took shape in the 20th century
I'd say Belgian from Flanders
Honestly I like to identify myself as a citizen of the European Union more than anything
But if I had to choose between Belgian and Flemish, than I'm more proud to be Belgian than Flemish
I think this is because I don't like what's associated (mainly by me) with Flanders, look at a map of the last elections for example
The same goes for Belgium compared to the EU, mainly the whole government thing we got going
Whereas Europe does so many great things to improve our daily lives
The controversies the EU does get involved in, I can somewhat stand behind
I also feel like the EU connects many people and it certainly creates a lot of opportunities, that a small country like Belgium just can't accomplish on its own
For me, it's in this order:
European
Flemish
Belgian
I’ll be honest: Wallonia feels like a completely different country and I feel more Flemish than Belgian
But this is different for every person, obviously
I feel more Flemish than Belgian
I don't feel like we should split the country and I don't hate the walloons
But it's safe to say that the inner workings of Belgium don't enhance the feeling of nationalism alot
It's Flemish or vanish
From personal experience: I‘m pretty sure the Flemish feel more proud to be a Fleming and would therefore call themselves Flemish rather than Belgian a lot of the time (but of course not always/not everyone
), while the Walloons tend to just call themselves Belgian
One could argue that this is reflected in the different political viewpoints from the north vs the south
Me personally, I would probably say “A Belgian from Flanders” if someone would ask me where I’m from :)
Ah yes totally easy to explain /s. Sometimes I feel Flemish, other times I feel Belgian
Usually Flemish within Belgium, Belgian when abroad
It’s a weird identify crisis to have sometimes
I’ve partially grown up in Brussels so I can’t really relate to some things like Flemish student culture, so it’s confusing
I’m also a Flemish person dating someone from Wallonia, so together it feels like we’re just Belgians with regional differences
I feel more connected to other Belgians mentality wise than lets say average Dutch or French people
I feel more flemish then Belgian because they’re are totally different because of the Walloons
Belgium also feels like 2 countries in one so yeah
Sorry for bad English
Definitly more so Flemish than Belgian
Outside of sports or trying to explain to someone from a far away country where youre from, you wont see much "Belgian". We are divided in pretty much everything
TV, news, language, political parties, how we vote even
Again a very long time without a government, goes to show Belgium is definitly a failed experiment imo
I feel more foreign in Wallonia than in the Netherlands tbh
There is no real feeling of "Belgian identity" or national unity, although some really would like (to believe) that
Belgium is disgusting
A ceremonial democracy under a totalitarian kingdom
A kingdom of the descendants of Leopold, who literally slaughtered more people than the Nazis
I feel the same when visiting the francophone part of Belgium
Toen moej ma up undr mulle klopn
Das volk dat op ons neer kijkt omdat het West-Vlaams spreekt
I don't know if there are a lot like me, but I feel as much Belgian as Flemish as European
Although if I'm in another country, I would say I'm from Belgium and not mention Flanders
But Wallonia still feels like another country
Same in reverse from Wallonia
I identify as Belgian, not Walloon, but Flanders feels more foreign than, say, the North of France
Same same
> But as always with Belgium it's complicated: Feeling Flemish in this day and age often goes supporting the Flemish independance parties NVA en Vlaams Belang
It's one of those shades of grey that's disappearing in today's hyperpartisan world of politics: people are expected to be either proud Belgians or Flemings
As if you can't be both
Yeah, I mostly see myself as Flemish, but I don't support Flemish independance
I just don't have any "link" with wallonia
America second
Brabantian here, Brabant forever
since I'm from the east of brabant I do feel a certain connection with our Limburgian friends (hell even Dutch Limburg feels like it isn't a different country) and Liège is chill too, but the 2 flemish provinces feel as foreign as Hainaut
Brabant first, Belgian second, European third
> Dunkerque
Rightful Belgian clay
En ne stamp in under klootn
En ze doen verzeekers allemaal drugs
drugs
druuuugs
Beautiful
That's basically it
Brussels isn't that big of a city
Actually for me it goes 2 steps deeper: Village - Community - Province - Flanders - Belgian - European
Belgium, only to see if my interlocutor knows where it's located
Joke aside, I would answer Belgium, because that's probably the kind of answer the people asking would expect
If I answered "Europe", then he would clearly be asking "which country
" next
If I were in a meeting/party/gathering with several people in the US, most of them Americans, except for one other European, I would probably feel closest to that European, even if he isn't Belgian
That's what I meant by "I feel European".
French
Somehow the fact that a Dutchie knows that dude fills me with pride
Ma wunder zin tit vre goe te verstoan
75% of the people who visit our beaches are probably from the North of France
Shared history, shared culture, shared hatred of the French for stealing our fries and claiming them as their own
The north of the country tends to vote towards the right of the political spectrum, while the south tends to vote towards the left
As a result, our politicians have been trying to form a government since last May
Never seen one in the wild
they don't identify as walloon, but politically are totally aligned to them
They are technically in Wallonia but I'm not sure they identify as Walloon
I think they identify more as their community (German speaking community) rather than their region (Wallonia)
Or they just feel Belgian
This is my guess from a nearby, French speaking city
Too bad nobody in Belgium knows the lyrics
Same, although not often do I really feel "Flemish". I find the differences between the rest of Flanders and Limburg equally big as between here and Wallonia, save for the language
I also easily associate with our Limburgish friends across the border
Maybe that replaces the "Flemish" sentiment for me ?
Te minste jen die vo oenze rechtn ipkomt
the flemish media have broken the cordon sanitaire, and the end result is that division
Damn
Now I feel like I should have tried to say something funny
Too late though
I fully understand your sentiment, I also live in Limburg and often the Flanders part gets skipped and more towards Belgian
But I do not associate myself with the Dutchies that much
Indeed
Was doing a walk from Westende to Dunkerque this summer but we had to stop after 30 mins because the beach got closed because they were doing a military training in Lombardsijde
Still was nice tho
it is common in banks
Straks blijft er niets meer van België en Nederland over en zijn het allemaal kleine nutteloze provincies
Charleroi, ["the ugliest city in the world"]
Just too late
But if you go a little bit further you have one of the nicest places in germany, dortmund
Just no
The club does a lot
Plus a lot of nature as well
The openminded-ness of people really depends on what parts of Brussel you visit
Atleast by night
Expensive-depends where you're coming from
Lets say I have a slightly different opinion of Brussels than you have,wich is perfectly fine to have
I’d say because we offer proper help to people
Are you sick or mentally unstable
Here’s some money from the state to go to a doctor or psychologist
Don’t have a job
Here’s a replacement income from the state
You can’t work for 2 months because of an illness
Here’s an income from the state
Americans are often just left alone, I think that’s why people start acting weird - especially when they already have a mental illness
Universal and cheap social security ?
Article 1
Belgium is a federal state, comprised from the communities and the regions
Following articles are all related to our federal state structure, article 8 through 32 is called "The Belgians and their rights". All other stuff is more boring state-stuff
I feel like the Russian one might need a little update
>It shall be organised on a decentralised basis
I thought France was a very centralised country
None of the regional languages (like Basque or Breton) are official in any of the regions for example
I believe your capital Riga was majority Russian speaking up untill like 15 years ago
The throwing up in Ayahuasca is presented as being part of the cleansing ceremony
Some people only drink juice for five days to cleanse their bodies
Others spend 80 hours a week doing a job they hate
People in general are just weird
Personal preference I guess
As a chronic pain patient I wouldn't mind throwing up every now and then and get less pain in return
Sometimes I really wish I could throw up, but I can't anymore due to surgery
It wouldn't be Dutch if there wasn't at least one middle aged woman with a kortpittig kapsel
Former residents of Doel (near Antwerp next to the largest nuclear power plant in Belgium) who had to be evacuated for the extension of the port
Now the project is canceled but the village has become a ghost town (only few people still live)  and a open-air street art museum
I think that there will be a reconstruction projet
Brussels
It can be such an amazing region but years of bad government have ruined it
I feel sorry for those living in Charleroi, it's getting better recently but it's still in the shadows of their great past during the great industrialization
I also feel sorry for flanders in general as they're currently getting brainwashed by newspapers and various medias  owned by less than good people that aim to make people take a direction to become more xenophobic, vlaams nationalist, etc
Kind of an issue that the cordon sanitaire isn't a thing anymore there and it is slowly transforming a region that was once lovely and tolerant into something that i don't recognize anymore
The South of the country
It's not that it's bad there by any means but there is still a very clear difference in development
And the region of Mol, with a higher than usual leukemia rate because of the nuclear research center
How is the Northeastern part
I feel like I hear much less from them than any other region of Turkey
That after WW2 Belgium was on the brink of a civil war about if our king (Leopold III) was allowed back or not (he lived in excile during WW2)
This lead to terrorist attacks, strikes and marches
For a period Wallonia was on the verge of declaring independence
It’s called the Royal Question
Edit: typo’s.
That in 1789 the Austrian-Netherlands had a revolution and formed the United States of Belgium, but the Austrians crused the revolution in 1790 and the Austrian-Netherlands were reestablished up until the Napoleonic wars
The battle of the golden spurs
Its about the only time in history that Belgium did something even remotely interesting
And ofc Ceasar calling us the bravest of all gauls but that's pretty well known I think
Don't want to be that guy, but it's called the 'Royal Question' in English, Question royale in French and Koningskwestie in Dutch
>For a period Wallonia was on the verge of declaring independence
How the turntables turn
Thought the wiki was kings question
My bad
That's okay
So much that they restored the English monarchy
drinking beer in a glass not designed for beer
makes me die inside whenever my father does it, but he comes from a country where beer isn't really a part of the culture so i let it slip
Not ordering a drink when going to a restaurant
I don't really like paying €2
5 or more for a 75cl bottle of soda knowing I can buy a 1
5l bottle of the same drink at the store across the street for less than half the price once the meal is over
Saying "no" when the waiter asks what to drink feels illegal though because the restaurant obviously makes a lot of their profit from it and it's just something people never do
people actually care about that shit
lmao
i eat a little bit of sugary stuff every day, and have always done so, and my dentist says my teeth are good
i hardly brush them every day
Same for beer in the wrong glass here
Please, explain
Or drinking a certain beer in a glass of another beer
Yea, the drinks are what brings in the cash
Not the food generally
I take out my pillbox when I ask for a glass of tap water, even when I don't really need to take any meds at that specific time
I usually have to take meds before eating anyway, but still, even if for some reason I don't I'd still take the box out as if to say
'You understand, right
' Makes me feel even more guilty, but on the other hand
got so much crap going on in my life I can't even leave the house without a giant pillbox and adult diapers in my handbag, so just get me some damn tap water, I don't want to pay for fucking Vitel
if they look chill i guess
i have talked to shitloads of strangers on the streets but i have never hit on girls in that way so idk xD
my father went to the US and he told me that when the waiters see your glass is empty, they refill it with water without asking
he found that epic
It's more about the correct shape/type of glass than the specific brand though
Some beer types need some glass types
Such as : chalice, pils glass, tulip, snifter, etc
So meeting up for just sex is fine but going on a movie date and then having sex is not
Seems like a great way to teach young people about healthy relationships
Yeah, exactly
I've been avoiding buying certain beers I like recently, because I recently moved house and the matching glasses are still wrapped up in the loft
I might be a relatively extreme case, though
In Flanders, were it not from Standard (Belgian) Dutch or tussentaal, you wouldn't understand someone speaking in a town 1 province over
So in the 19th-20th century people started trying this new standard language, couldn't really do it, and got stuck somewhere inbetween dialect and standard
That language is tussentaal, and it has the features that it lacks interesting local vocabulary or grammatical forms, and is still too unintelligable for a Dutch speaker from for example the Netherlands
The worst from two worlds essetially
In dutch words can have multiple meanings
For example: the word weg can mean both road and gone, depending on the context
I study ancient Greek in high school, and it had that too
It's pretty rare, so when encountered we're firsted completely weirded out, then, somewhat annoyed, be like "it's dualis isn't it
". It can really throw you off
Ah I wanted to say gezellig haha
And I love it
I'm pretty sure a lot of languages have that
Scots is way closer to other Getmanic languages than English
Whenever I hear it, I'm surprised how much I can understand because I speak Dutch
A lot of words are very similar, whereas these are replaced with French ones in English
I don't think they do this anymore, but if they used it in ancient texts, it usually was meant to lay extra emphasis on the fact that it was 2
It can sometims be an important piece of information to understand the text
Hello,
Here in Belgium we have to choose from age 12, but in most schools Greek can only be learned from age 13, in second year, or even later than that
Greek is a rather niche study path, only available in aso, probably comparable to your liceo
In my school we have \~12-20 Greek students per year, and I'm quite comfortable saying that that's quite high in comparisson to other schools
In Belgium there usually aren't special schools for specific fields, like a school for math, one for sciences; instead all fields are usually in one school, but you can still choose, for example, humanities, economics, sciences, latin, greek, math, usually making a combination of 2 directions (5^(th) & 6^(th) year)
>In fact, it is so commonly used that some words, like „Mädchen“ (girl) have become standard
It's the same in Dutch: 'meisje'
basically yes, but because it's a suffix in a word it's more subtle and easier to gloss over
No way in hell I'm going to pick summer time
Even winter time is off by one hour of what our "natural hour" is supposed to be
While summer time means more light in the afternoon in the summer, it also means dark as fuck all morning in winter while everyone is on their way to work and children are walking to school
No amount of fun summer evenings can ever justify the immense dangers it would entail
Overall I'd say summer time, but for Western Europe this doesn't make sense
We should be the same time zone as the UK, but we aren't because of a relic of WWII
Thus I'd say we must be GMT + 1 (UK summer time but Central European wintet time)
Winter time is biologically more correct but at this point I dont care which: just pick one and stop this fucking change twice per year
Whichever they want as long as they fucking stick to it
For all I care they reverse the fucking clock
How about a middle road solution and move the clock forward/backward half an hour
Many scientists from various disciplines have advocated for this solution, as it mitigates the harmful effects of both summer time and winter time
It's not a perfect solution, but arguably a better one than keeping either time, let alone the current system
There is a significant spike in heart attacks, insomnia and other problems each time the clocks are put an hour forwards/backwards
Was going to say this
But it's more a typical Belgian solution : compromise
I'm arguing for the safety of these people on their way to work and children
Natural light is very important to keep alert and awake, while also granting a better vision than in the dark
If we go to UTC+2 in winter the sun won't rise until 10am
We’re the country with the most castles per square kilometer in the world
Also, Brussels International Airport is the location where the most chocolate is sold worldwide
Edit: rephrased my 2nd fact
So that means you killed them
>Prison escape is not punishable by law in Germany
I think it's the same here
>Prison escape is not punishable by law in Germany
Belgium too, but if you don't mail back your jumpsuit it will be considered stolen, which IS a crime
This is absolutely amazing
I believe we were the second country to legalize it
Wales has 600 castles in 20735 km^2, which is 1 castle every 34
56 km^2
Belgium has 3000 castles in 30689 km^2, which is 1 castle every 10
23 km^2
Sooo Wales is lying
[You were having the party of the century lol]
Belief me there is no dog meat in frikandel, i think there is not even meat in it
That is a majestic castle
I’ve always wanted to do a roadtrip in Wales, the nature + history is so stunning
This is the closest castle to me:
Fun fact about this castle: in 1949 it got sieged by police because students took it over because they were protesting the fact that the price of beer was going to get raised
Edit: too much god damn typo’s.
Is there a difference between an english castle and a chateau
Isn't it the other way around
Students took it over and the police was besieging them
ah yes, students and their undying love for beets
Oh right, just made a typo
I’ll change it
This post has been one shitshow in regards to typos
My bad
Oh well Belgium is especially full of those
This is mainly due to Flanders being the richest region north of the Alps during the 12th-16th century
Cities as Bruges, Ghent, Ypres and Antwerp were the European heart of trade where all different types of products (wood from Scandinavia, wool from England, stuff from Russia, etc
) were traded and made
Because of this we had a lot of rich folks that build castles for themselves
haha no don't worry, made my day :)
And if I'm not mistaken, the rise of the beer price was not the only thing the students were protesting against
Normally, police uniforms had white hats which made them very easy to spot
They were planning to change the hats / helmets to blue, which made it easier to blend in a crowd and more difficult to see from a distance
Students weren't so fond of this change
Yes you’re correct
Antwerp
Trying to drive a car in GTA with that amount of traffic would be hella funny
Paris, it’s as beautiful as it is dirty and dangerous
I feel like people outside of Europe have a very romanticized view on most EU cities, so it would be interesting to see them portrayed as they actually are; like any major city
Breaking news, local crackhead stuck in traffic on ring
Mayor: ladies and gentlemen, we got 'em
I'd love to play sidemissions for an idiot Filip Dewinter parody
Can you imagine the social commentary you could include if there was an idiot militant Vlaams Belang like faction in vein of the border patrol sidemission guys from GTAV
Putting the 4 freedoms to good use
“Follow the damn muslim filip”
Also the temper of the locals
You don't need a satnav, you need a sherpa
Mine just starts screaming when they find out we’re driving via Antwerp
Manneken Pis, def
I saw it once and was very disappointed
It's not much
It's just a small statue thats "peeing". And it's really small, you can barely see it because of all the people there :')
Manneken Pis for sure
I would say Manneken Pis probably, because one: it will likely be crowded by tourists and two: it's really not that impressive
Go see the lion of Waterloo instead or maybe the statue of Ambiorix in Tongeren
There used to be a TV show that followed Belgian consulates and embassies around the world
The majority of the consulate in Barcelona's workload was replacing stolen passports
In your opinion, what **would** be an amazing place for tourists to go to, which people don't necessarily know of
Loch Ness is amazing because of Fort Augustus for me
I wouldn’t take a boat tour, eather stay in the little town
Edinburgh Castle is amazing and probably the must see in Edinburgh if you’re into history
Been to Edinburgh twice and I always spend around 4-5 hours there
Can you recommend some other less crowded hikes in Norway
Totally offtopic, but as a vampire obsessed person I love your username
I wouldn't call this a tourist trap as you don't need to pay to see it
It's just extremely boring
I still don't understand why all the tourists want to see a small, boring statue
I love the thermal baths in Budapest
Ahh, I misunderstood the words "tourist trap" then :P
Thank you
I collect beer glasses and Smurf figurines and my fridge is pretty much filled with mayo based sauces and beer
I don’t like beer
Though I recently learned to appreciate fries so I’m getting better at belgianing
I’ve also always loved chocolate so that was right from the start
(I’m on mobile and I can’t make it do the fancy flag flair, or I don’t know how, sorry
I live in a small apartment in Brussels filled to the brim with comic books, I own a mini fridge (next to my regular fridge) mostly containing beer, I know a lot of jokes about French people, I have absolutely no idea how my country's political system is still holding up and I'd say I have a pretty good sense of self-mockery
On the other hand, my Dutch is pretty bad and I don't say "une fois" (but to be fair, no one actually does)
I absolutely love our beer and fries
On the other han I'm not really into the football or sport cycling/cyclocross scene, though
I don't have a beer glass collection
Seventy isn't a collection yet
Yes, I am a dumb asocial cunt that drinks a lot of beer
Ecxept for the Smurf figurines, entirely same
It isn't even a stereotype because almost every guy i know has mayo and beer in their fridge (women a lot less but still a lot)
How about mussles, stoofvlees and vol-au-vent
And nagging about every little thing (are you a grumpy person)
Do you hate Walloons/ French people in general
How old are you and when did you start enjoying fries
And what do you eat it with
Tintin isn't even the best Belgian comics
Haha, "often 2,5 minutes late" seems a pretty cliché German way to be late, though
Glad I'm not the only one with a dedicated beer fridge
I don't think we have any like that, maybe ask America, they do that sort of thing (still disgusted from Turkey Beer)
I like mussels, don’t like stoofvlees and vol-au-vent (or anything that resembles those type of dishes like hutsepot or waterzooi)
I do enjoy a good complaining session but have nothing against Walloons or French people
Late twenties
I always ate fries but like 10-15 per meal and I’d be done with them
I think I started to really enjoy them about a year ago or something, cause we go to the “frituur” more often and I think I got hooked
I still don’t like home made ones though
I eat them with mayonnaise, or if you meant with what side dishes I eat them then it’s always with some kind of “frituursnack”.
Turning more Belgian
Frituur ones are _nearly_ always the best, should explore a bit with sauces (on the side) and maybe if you're feeling adventerous, have some "Saté kruiden"
Enjoy them fellow Belgian :D
We tend to be portrayed exactly as countries around the world see us
Non-existent
Except for In Bruges, but then again, it just showed Bruges
Belgium doesn't exist in the world of Hollywood, as far as I know
Oh wait, there's Dr
Evil from Austin Powers
Having very little information on the differences between Eastern-European countries the bit of news I did hear over the years was that Slovenia is doing rather well
You've got In Bruges, but I've never really seen that one and that's the only one I'm aware off
I'm not completely sure it's american either
I think that part of the movie was pretty spot on
The Expatriate takes place in Belgium
It’d actually pretty good
This is just the worst scene in it
Don't worry, I'm sure portrayals of Hungary speak a Slavic language often enough
It's all "Eastern-Europe" to them
Anything East of Germany is East-Europe as far as I'm concerned
Also known as "the countries I never learned too much about in history class". More a depiction of my ignorance than anything else
I mean this one seems believable, they got a point about how it'd be easier with demons
This is a thread about conspiracy theories, not a thread about actual cover ups
Stop spreading the myth that Finland is real
Wake up SHEEPLE
It is like "cabin in the woods"
Well, hardcore nationalists/extreme rightwingers will see a downside to this
Well, germany supposedly has the most power and influence in the EU, and could easely take on the leader role, but it doesn’t do that
Because of obvious “historical reasons”. So france, being the second largest power, takes that role on them
I wouldn’t mind if germany takes on more of a leader role and centralises the EU a bit more, it’s been 80 years people get over it
'a' is only used in typing
α is used in writing, often in cursive
The same goes for open tail 'g', looptail 'g' and the handwritten 'g'.
The first two are in general only used for typing, while most write the cursive 'g' with a loop
Ok so we want Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, Noord Brabant, and Limburg from the Netherlands
And also France is going to have to return Frans Vlaanderen
No pressure guys but we'll invade tomorrow after lunch
i don't like this posts comments, my country will be split up over germany france the netherlands and luxembourg
I believe a few years ago the wikipedia page of San Marino was "locked" on the night of the contest because they were afraid Italians would deface it if they didn't get their twelve points
Joke's on you, our highest hill is just a couple of meters short of being a mountain
Not even including [Rockall] tssk
Next time
Might have to wait for a long time while while we try to form the current one
I know a lot and it is all from the internet: You Tube, Radio free Europe
The Belgian media just doesn't want to cover these topics until it becomes very big
They only care about the US, France, Germany, UK and the Netherlands
In Belgium it is not the top story, but it is covered
Although most people don't really know the exact situation in Belarus
Personally I wholeheartedly support the pro democracy movement, just hoping that it doesn't come to a bloodshed
Even if Lukashenko has a majority it is still unhealthy for a country to have the same man in charge for all these years
But right know he just oppresses the opposition and changes the results of the election for his personal gain
[Physical confrontations between Belarusian police and protesters about controversial election results
I hope it gets the same results as Ukraine's Maidan revolution, but that's probably out of reach
Right now they're classified as "election night clashes", I think it'll stay that way tbh I've grown cynical
I would really like to see them gain a more pro-EU stance and government
Less corruption and more international unity is what we need
I saw some guy walking on the street getting kidnapped by government officials in a white van on the news
Scary stuff man
Last night's evening new did cover the elections
However at that time they only covered that it's happening and that it overt supporters of the opposition can get picked off the streets for protesting
Yeah but there was so much to tell before the election
It will probably come back in the news today now that the protests are escalating
Supersizing food or drinks
There are so many:
\-VAT added at the check-out
As a customer I don't give a shit about what the original price of something was, I only care about how much money **I** am going to spend on it
\-Flags, American flags everywhere
I can get it if you're an immigrant and hanging your original country's flag (maybe with an American flag next to it) outside your house to show you're both
Just American flags is more difficult to get for me
When I see an American flag hanging outside of a house in the US, all I can think is 'Duuhhh, this is the US, of course you're American
" But maybe if I stretch my brains and try to understand what it is to be so patriotic, I might sort of, kind of, a tiny little bit understand
What I can't understand is why a car dealership who sells a foreign brand (e.g. Japanese cars) would put 2-3 massive poles with massive American flags in front of their company
If you sold only US brand, I might get it as advertising that you are so homecountry loving
But they sell Japanese cars, why do you need 2-3 massive American flags out front
I just don't understand, this is not someone that found a flag on their attic and though "you know what, I'll put it in front of the company for some extra decoration
" No someone actually had to justify using a decent bit of budget to buy massive poles, massive flags and labor cost to drill holes into the ground, probably get some kind of crane (I doubt the poles could have been put there just by manual strenght) to put the poles into place
Actual budget and thought must have gone into deciding that this was necessary for the company, for some reason
\-Eating (fast food) in your cars
I'm not talking about being in a hurry, go through a drive through and eat on your way to work/...No I'm talking about going through a drive through, then park in the parking lot of that fast food chain and eating in your car
How is that more convenient than going inside, using an actual table and not risking making your car dirty
(I'm sure this doesn't apply to all Americans, but I knew someone who did this and I've seen others do it too
So I'm sure it's not a complete unusual thing
\-Tipping
I understand that it's a nice thing to leave a little tip when service was great
But I don't understand why it's not required to pay waiters at least minimum wage and why the customer has to carry the burden of making sure that these people can earn a living
Also tipping hair dressers, if I'm just cutting my hair
Am I just paying for two pumps of shampoo, a bit of water and wear and tear on the comb and scissors
In Belgium when I pay for a hair dresser, I always assume that the majority of the cost is actually the labor cost, so I don't get why that would be reduced to 'a tip'.
\-Drinking age: Do we really expect people who are considered to be adults and people who are going through college/university, to really not drink any alcohol
\-All the beeping on TV
If you beep out a swear word, you're actually attracting more attention to it
If someone responds "That's fucking GREAT
" I might have barely noticed that a swear word was used, but if it is "Thats BEEEEEEPP GREAT" Yeah I definitely noticed that a swear word was used
Also changed songs where they took out swear words are weird to me
In Belgium they're not beeped out
It happened multiple times that I knew a song (unscensored) from the radio in Belgium and then suddenly I heard the song somewhere in some American media and it's either beeped out or the lyrics were changed
Like 'Fuck you' from Cee Lo Green, the first time I heard 'Forget you' somewhere, I was really confused
Or all the silent pauzes were so disturbing the first time I heard the cleaned up version of 'Fuck It' form Eamon
\-The Pledge of Allegiance in schools
WTH, that to me seems like complete brainwashing
I could maybe understand starting the day with singing the national anthem and even that I would probably find exaggerated
But having kids vow and making a promise  they probably don't even understand
Pledging allegiance to a nation UNDER GOD at an age they probably never even took the time to deeply think it thought if they actually believe in a God or not or if they do, which God(s) they believe in
I've read it's not mandatory and you can refuse it
But kids will generally go along with what they've been told even if they haven't thought it through what it means
To me it always seemed creepy
The image of a totalitarian country brainwashing it's citizens since childhood
\-Gaps in stalls of public toilets
I have no issues with gasps on the bottom or top, but on the side
Why bother putting doors at all if the gaps are sometimes so huge you easily see everything inside completely by accident
\-A backer's dozen
Though I quite like this one, I find it quite charmingly sounding actually
\-The US customary system (a.k.a. US Imperial system), yup as a metric system user it confuses me
\-US money (coins and bills)  I'm used to euros where the bills have different sizes and different colors
A quick glance into my wallet gives an immediate idea of how much money I have
In the US the bills are all the same size and all grey-greenish
If you look in your wallet and see around 10 notes, you have no clue if you have 10 dollars or 230 dollars
Also the coins are annoying, but I think this mainly just applies to tourists, people new in the US
Certain coins do not mention how much they're worth in numbers
As someone new to US coins it might be difficult to learn by heart in the beginning that 1 dime = 0,10 dollar and it's no help whatsoever if the coin itself just says 'ONE DIME'. Also it confused the hell out of me that 0,10 dollars (dime) is a way smaller coin than 0,05 dollars (nickel)
\-Not drinking alcohol in public
When I was in Florida somewhere, every Thrusday evening there was a musical event close to a beach
There was a little wooden gazebo with enough space for a band and some chairs
Most people sat around the gazebo in their own beach chairs
It was a nice event, mainly attended by people 50+, but also some younger people and children
It always seemed so weird that at a time like that people had to hide that they were drinking a beer
Also what's with the paper bag
By now drinking something out of a paper bag should probably be synonymous with drinking alcohol right
There's probably much more that I can't think of right now
&#x200B;
Edit: I just thought of another one: fixed shower heads
I can only speak from my experience in some homes/hotels/motels in Florida but I've heard it once or twice from other people who went somewhere else in the US
I don't understand why they have fixed shower heads and not ones you can choose to put in a holder or choose to take in your hand
How can you decently rinse anything below your waist without doing a handstand
(Or is that the secret American way of showering
:p )
4 way stops
"My great great grandparents best friend was irish so im irish" while probably not even knowing where eorope os located
How they are all so fat and everything needs to be massive
I think it's a combination of habit and cost
At least for the average Joe, I think if you've used miles and gallons and lbs (what's up with that abbreviation btw) your entire life, you won't easily switch over to another one
18 years ago, the euro was introduced in Belgium
Whenever my dad talks about about buying a car or a house or anything that costs quite a bit, he talks about the price in Belgian franks (and then I have to convert to understand wth he's talking about)
He's not the only one, I've heard many people over the age of 50, who still regularly mention prices in Belgian Franks
Habits are difficult to change
And with things like measurements and amounts there's this thing of instinctively knowing how much something is
I know that 1ft is around 30cm, but when I watch an American show/movie and they're talking about "And it was 15 feet high
" I have no immediate (instinctive) grasp on how high that is
I need to pauze the video to think about it, calculate it etc
So for people who have used the imperial system their entire lives, I'm sure in every day life they're not eager to change
&#x200B;
Also changing everything would be a huge cost
How much exactly, no one knows
Things like street signs need to be changed (I was shocked when I once read about how costly street signs actually are), labels need to be changed on every product, scales need to be changed, a lot of educational things need to be changed (like text books, rulers, maybe certain posters on classroom walls etc) and many many things I can't even come up with
It would cost billions of US dollars I am sure
Then again I also read that the US loses a lot of money from not changing to metric because of extra calculations and calculation mistakes that happen (e.g. in international trade etc)
I think in the long run there's no doubt that changing to metric is the best option
But I think the problems lie in the short run, high short term costs and issues with the average Americans adapting in their day to day lives
Imagine my disappointment when I went to a dollar store for the first time in my life
I was standing at the check out, with my dollar in my hand, ready to give it to the employee and suddenly she says: That'll be $1,06" o\_0
I strongly concur with that
Americans are insanely bad at classifying people from different ethnic groups (I'm generalizing of course, but even the US Census Bureau uses some pretty simplistic racial categories)
"Black/Brown/White", all those are just superficial categorizations that are not truly representative of the difference between ethnic groups, a dark-skin Caribbean, a West-African, and an Afro-American would all fall under the same category : "Black"
A Slav, a North African, a caucasian European, and a "White American" would fall under the same category too : "White"
And this "white" ethnical categorization just means that everyone who's "light-skin" belongs to the same ethnicity, which is factually wrong
And what I personally hate the most is the term "person of color".
Who tf falls under that category anyway
Everyone who's not ethnically caucasian
Then that's so fucking broad, it literally makes no sense to put people from drastically different cultures, ethnic groups, and backgrounds into one single superficial category
What about people from non-western cultures that are ethnically "light-skin"? (Persians, North Africans, Slavs, etc
It's just pure nonsense
>Letting private companies run things the state should do
(Like prisons)
I saw a documentary that even exposed privatization in the foster care/social work system
The country is doomed
>No need to obsess over it
That's because those who obsess over it don't actually know what it is and could not even tell you the tenets if you asked them to
I didn't know that about the money
Did they change it quite recently and is it already quite usual to see these everywhere or not
The last time I was in the US was 3-4 years ago (in Florida), all the bills I got in my hand back then were the green-gray ones
(Though I doubt I ever had a $100 in my hand)
I didn't know that, never been to Norway, I hope one day I'll visit it
Nice picture, seems like a nice area to live
I have no idea what you are trying to say
You could argue that they've gotten more "westernized" for the past few decades after the fall of the USSR and the foundation of the European Union, but no, any country that was east of the iron curtain during the cold war wouldn't be considered as "Western".
Western countries include mostly Western Europe (including the nordic countries), North America (United States and Canada), without forgetting Australia and New Zealand
Interesting
I know what you mean, in Dutch we call it 'wimpel', I'm also not sure what the English word is
Strangely enough Wikipedia doesn't have it
I did find the word 'pennant'. But it doesn't get the same results in Google Images as 'vimpel' or 'wimpel'. It looks like pennants way shorter and are mainly used for sports teams or universities
Well of course not, Communism emerged in Gemany which is definitely a western country
But I think when you look at both recent and Ancient history, there are commonalities between Western nations :
-This western/eastern divide in Europe could be traced back to the theological separation between Western Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Europe
-Western countries of course get a lot of inspiration and are heavily-influenced in their culture from ancient civilizations such as the Roman empire or ancient Greece
Things like political philosophy, science, architecture were impacted a lot by the Greeks, and Ancient Rome of course gave us many other elements such as urban engineering, the rule of law, governance, and republicanism
And believe it or not, but it was also greatly expanded later on during the Islamic Golden Age from the imported Arab contributions in medieval Europe (after the dark ages), such as innovations in literature, astronomy, mathematics, and medicine
Without forgetting all of the imported innovations via the silk road (chinese inventions like paper or gunpowder)
-More recently, you could argue that after the Renaissance, the Enlightenment era shaped what would be considered the modern-day definition of the "West", with new ideologies and philosophies such as liberalism, reductionism, egalitarianism, and rationalism
-In modern western societies, there are some defining tendencies at the societal level that could broadly  define what a western country is : Democracy (or political pluralism in general), secularism (although Americans are definetly less secular in quite a few aspects that the rest of the western world), individual liberties and civil rights (not saying that non-western countries aren't free, just saying that it's a common characteristic within the western world that emerged during the Enlightenment), capitalism/free-market economy (especially after the industrial revolution)
At least that's how I personally see it, but then again this is very broad and extremely subjective, so take it with a grain of salt ;)
>we have like 300 in about 3 weeks
We have 300 deaths per day
Everything you just cited applies to countries like Poland, Czechia or Slovenia
This clear East-West division in Europe is something that definitely stems from the Cold War
Oh yea definetly
As mentionned previously, most eastern European countries got westernized in quite a few aspects since the fall of the USSR and the foundation of the European Union, without forgetting the expansion of NATO
No, they were already "western" way before WW II
Copernicus, one of the key figures of the scientific revolution, was from Poland
Poland was Catholic before the Nordic countries were even christianised
Jan Hus, a Czech Theologian, was already preaching the reformation of the Roman Catholic Church before Martin Luther was even born
The kingdom of Bohemia (present day Czechia) became part of the Holy Roman Empire when vikings were still going on raids
Slovenia on the other hand has been deeply influenced by Austria and Italy for centuries and experienced the Renaissance earlier than many other parts of Europe
Dads get 15 working days paid paternity leave
Moms get 15 weeks
Ours just said to go get it but stay "on the clock", so no paid day off but however long we stay out counts towards a full workday as usual
We do also get a paid day for one day of volunteering at a local health facility involving Covid
But then my dad and his coworkers at the local commune discovered you could donate plasma once a month
Wasn't sure anymore
I know they went once a month because that was their maximum of getting an extra day of
I'm biased but I feel like Mechelen is quite underrated, with its rich history, many beautiful monuments and four UNESCO mentions
The school in the nearby village of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Waver (where I grew up) is also a hidden gem
If bigger cities I would say Bruges
Otherwise you can probably find a few well preserved little towns as well
I spend a lovely day and night in Bamberg
I was on a holiday in Slovenia with my girlfriend, we were planning on staying a few might here or there, nothing booked and just see where we'll get
We only had a tough schedule planned out
We were in the Alpine region of Slovenia (lovely region
) for two nights when the weather prediction predicted lots and lots of rain and thunderstorms
So we just said "let's go to where the sun is shining". Looking at weather predictions from all over Europe it was only northern/eastern Germany so we decided to go towards Dresden
We decided to do the trip in 2 days to take it easy
So we were looking for a place to sleep somewhere (on a camping) and my girlfriend saw the name Bamberg, thought is sounded cute and so we decided to stay the night in the area
We were very pleasantly surprised by the city, of which we had no knowledge before
Beautiful city centre, lovely architecture (of which you don't find much due to WW2) of the medieval period and we had a blast there
I finished my Erasmus in Budapest with a stay at the Balaton lake and we visited Tihany, it was so beautiful
In Flemish (and also in Dutch, even in the official "Algemeen Nederlands") the word "slim" means something like "smart, wise, keen".
In English it means "thin".
English : eventually
French : éventuellement
The English is more like a final status, when the French one is more a hypothetical event
Interesting fact, "Fee" in English has the same origin as "Vieh" in German (sounds more or less the same to me), where it retained it's original meaning of cattle or livestock
Cattle was often used as currency in the past, hence the meaning changed to mean "payment".
Lol, "kaka" in Flemish Dutch at least means "shit/feces" I wouldn't wanna eat a cake that is called "kaka" in Sweden lmao
When I asked Germans if they knew/understood the word Nachtmahr, they said they didn't. Isn't it a specifically Austrian term for it ?
Also in French, "une glace" is an icecream
Yup, same in French, but with C's.
used pretty frequently in that context here below the border
bijkomen is more like when someone passed out and wakes up (or when someone gains weight)
Flemish here: we hear more news about the US and the UK than The Netherlands or France, they come at a close third though
How we feel about it
Considering the Netherlands gives (mostly) boring news and France only news from Northern France, it isn't a big issue at all
Would like less new about nr 1 and 2 though
Nah not really
And I wouldnt really mind either: I love both The Netherlands and France
Belgium is tiny and just not such a big player on a world scale
Im fine with that
I learned we had reached an agreement for a federal government through a french online newspaper
Well, I sure wish we had less news about France, and more news about the Netherlands and Germany as well
Or even better, more news about Flanders too
Idk about Wallonia but there really isn’t much French or Dutch news in Flanders
Most of it is Flemish/Belgian news, European or international
I actually hear very little of the Netherlands on the other side of the language border
Try watching zondag met Lubach
Fun way to get into Dutch current news
I don't know if I can say with a straight face that we're *well* informed about the Netherlands, but regardless, I do agree that they do not dominate our news cycle
Yeah also, it doesn't seem like many Flemings watch Dutch tv at all, whereas Walloon apparently watch a lot of French tv
Totally agree
Sadly, our Flemish news reports very little about Wallonia, with the result that the only things Flemish people know about Wallonnia consists of outdated stereotypes
Oh no, don't get me wrong, I don't see it as a bad thing at all
It's just that it doesn't matter much to see much news from the Netherlands because of that reason, as there isn't much to tell anyway
Well, don't get me wrong, it's still boring, but the shitty kind of boring
Temptation Island, Expeditie Robinson etc
Mixed results really, but that has nothing to do with wether there are Dutch people in it
Although there is always a lost famous Dutch person in most Flemish programs
Makes sense, news from Northern France is somewhat relevant to us, and news from Belgium is somewhat relevant for Northern France
It is definitely a good thing :)
It's alright, you are now part of the boring neighbours
Rejoice
Instead of just adding "Portugal", try adding "site:.pt". This ensures that all suggestions will be from Portuguese sites instead of Brazilian ones
There are separate organisations taking care of public television and radio channels, yes
Flanders has the VRT (*Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie*), and Wallonia has the RTBF (*Radio-télévision belge de la Communauté française*)
The main channels (*één* and *RTBF 1*, respectively) are available nationally, though
We need a small Benelux news portion in the same vein as sports and weather
Would be rather cool
It's an oversymplification to say we are culturaly that different
We all have the same passion for beer, have the same bourgondian lifestyle and the 'aleise' mentality
The biggest difference is the political landscape and language, but a single fleming and a single walloon have a lot in common
You'll find that the world's greatest beer makes for a pretty potent unifying force
(Partially joking :p )
We do have the Belgian Red Devils, our national football team
I've never seen so many Belgian flags and general proudness of our country when they played for the World Cup
It's in those moment we unite
(With beer ofcourse
I can't find it on my Flemish digital television, but it might be available in Wallonia
(By the way, I apologize to my German community fellow countrymen for overlooking them
It is though
riots in the Netherlands, France or Germany would affect my life in Belgium more than riots in the US
Same goes for police violence, politics, shootings or whatever other news I get from the US would be have a much bigger impact on my life if they would happen in one of our neighbouring countries
I mean, I don't listen to radio or watch television so I consume little Belgium news myself :p.
Big stories I'll hear on /r/belgium
Like we have a government now
No idea what parties are involved with it, I just know the right wingers are mad so that's good I guess
>No idea what parties are involved with it, I just know the right wingers are mad so that's good I guess
Good and bad to be honest
Good that we have one and that we avoided going too right
Bad that if this government doesn't do great we will definitely have a rightwing government next term
First of all, I never said that the US isn't relevant at all
But the actions of the Netherlands, France and Germany do in fact have more effect on the average Belgian
Why
2 of thel are the most influential countries of the EU, the Netherlands and Belgium have close bonds with eachother and our police often need to work together
The same goes for France
What happens there affect the *daily* life of the Belgians
The two last things you mentioneda doesn't affect the average Belgian at all nor does sanctioning certain countries, at least not noticable
And the US companies sure are important, but that is not US politics, Facebook only comes in the news because *Europe* will sanction it if they do not obey our laws
I'd worry more about the Chinese when it comes to tech
And even then, all things you just said are major issues, afcpurse those are important
But just another mass shooting, riot or scandal in the US will affect me way less than if it would happen in my neighbouring countries
Which happens to be exactly what our news is oversaturated with
Not
But for most people every government does bad so it's not even that imo
They could do great and propaganda and uninformed people will still think they did a bad job regardless
I just accept that after a while the right will get in power until they fuck it up badly enough for the left to get off their ass
>I just accept that after a while the right will get in power until they fuck it up badly enough for the left to get off their ass
That is the only reason I was hoping that they'd break Cordon Sanitaire this time arround, so people would see VB isn't the answer
Yes, but that's the thing our news is oversaturated by domestic issues from the US
Obviously we don't complain about relevant news
It's a toss-up between Sweden and Spain
I'm pretty sure I could learn either's language pretty quickly, if I needed to
I'm fine where I am
I'd love to live in Italy and my Italian is good enough for that but the economical situation over there is unfortunately way too dire atm and there's no short/medium term improvement in sight :(
I'm happy to live in Belgium so I have no desire to live in another country
I like it here
Other than the weird political landscape I wouldn't really feel happier somewhere else I think
I think Austria, I just love the mountains
You get to pick one language to speak fluently
Knowledge of the others will either be very broken or non-existant
Thank you for mentioning Flanders
Most people in this thread say the Nethetlands but life in Flanders is basically the same
Except for our roads that are worse, but our food is better imo
That's a very good point you bring up there
Lots of people don't realize what the average population density    is in this part of Europe
I love Austria for a summer holiday but during winter in  the mountains I think we would be up for a shock
Just like everyone else
Germanic with a case system, ***only hardcore
***
Correct
Unfortunately, I barely speak French :(
I fit in better in Sweden, the way my first name is written, no
2: Swedish rolls of the tongue more easily
3: I kinda like living in the EU
Undskyld
An ingenious system of clothing with UV and IR lamps build into it
I grew up mostly in Belgium but I still feel instantly energized and happier when I feel the turkish air and sun around me
Ito seemso too meo ao bito ofo naiveo schemeo
All three of us
I get the same thing but the other way around
I'm Belgian and I don't speak Dutch but a lot of the time, when a fellow Belgian approaches me online, they speak Dutch and then think I'm a foreigner when I say I don't speak Dutch
It's the weirdest thing
Nous sommes la majorité, nom de dieu xD
This is so typical for French people lol
North flanders
In France, when I spoke Dutch with my family, people would occasionally assume we wouldn't understand French, and complain about tourists and their language, after which they would address us in nightmarishly thick English
Always fun to bring up that little irony in French ^^
I had a quite similar experience in London
I was with my cousin in the touristic boat that is cruising over the Thames and we were chatting in Dutch when I hear the French couple in front of us talking about us
The girl whispers to her bf "honey, what language are those two speaking
" and the man to answer "Russian I think". Lol
I didn't correct them, it was just too funny
My stepdad once got approached by another guy selling souvenirs in Egypt
He likes say: oh, another idiot selling me shit here (not the exect words and in dutch)
The guy responded with: you could have just say you're not intrested instead of insulting me (in dutch)
Took a Russian evening class, and just the day before yesterday I went to to buy some shoes
People in front of me were talking in Russian *at least I thought so*. Trying to swap shoes or something
The cashier was trying to explain they didn't have a size shoe anymore but they did at their other store
But since her English was terrible I helped with that
She gave them the address but they didn't know the way
So I politely intervented with an *извините пожалуйста, вы русский, да?*, and gave them directions via *идите налево / направо / направо*. So it was kinda worth it I guess
I speak 4 languages fluently, and a couple others little bits and bobs
I travel often, and yet have not had those gotcha moments :(
I regularly play with the French and Spanish decks because I'm half Belgian, half Spanish
I like to play "La escoba" and "Chinchón".
I also play Koi-koi with some family members using a Japanese hanafuda deck of cards
I'm Moroccan-Belgian, never seen 'em in Belgium but they're definitely insanely popular in Morocco
I feel like it's a Mediterranean thing 'cause they're also widely popular in Italy, Croatia, etc
I didn't even know that existed
I'd also never heard if the 'French deck' because I just thought that was the 'normal deck'. So no, I'm pretty sure this is unknown here
Never seen that
TIL there's a Spanish deck of cards
**yes**
When I just had my license for like 2 weeks or so, I almost had a car crash because some 85y old man (at least he looked that old) started driving against traffic
Very scary experience, especially since it was one of the first times I was driving alone
Have been in favour of a driving test for the elder people ever since
The environment would definitly benefit from it
Yes, definitely
Here in Belgium the most dangerous drivers I've driven past/alongside are elderly people "with no time".
Depends when
Fall just started and it was 11°C today
I was cold the whole day
In 2 weeks, 11°C will feel normal again and 0°C will feel cold
Depens on the wind as well
0°C is okay when there's no cold wind
10°C with a cold wind feels like it's freezing
A good jacket
I'd guess that would be when it drops below 5°C if it's not just for going outside and tossing something in a dumpster
I don't really have a specialized cold-weather jacket though so that's something to keep in mind
A good jacket probably only when the temperature dips below 10°C. As long as it's at 15°C or slightly below, a pullover and a summer jacket will do
Also interesting note: I recently moved to the south of France (Atlantic coast, not Côte d'Azur) and while in my home country I'm definitely not someone who wears shorts all the time, the temperature where shorts are still considered as suitable is way lower for myself than it is for the French in this region
hmm i start wearing my good jacket when it dips below 10C, add a hoodie or the like below 5 and more layers of it starts freezing
Was about to write something similar
The same goes for "warm outside".
During winter 15°C is warm, autumn it's arround 18-20°C and summer is anything above 30°C (used to be 25°C)
Politicians of that nature can be found anywhere
10 years ago the whole country was happy when there was finally a day where it was 28 degrees and no rain
Now we're all happy when there's a day where it's colder than 25 degrees
(It's a bit exagurated but still)
For me it depends
Rain after a week of 25°C is heaven to me
Rain when it is 15°C or lower (until it becomes proper snow that actually stays for a few days) sucks
The same goes somewhat for wind
Temperature wise 2 days of 30°C was a lot and now we often wish for rain
A lot has changed in the last 8 summers
Autumn is still wet, summer not so much
I just see the map of europe in my head
I suppose no real words come to mind
I just see the map of Europe and the flag of the EU/Council of Europe
Home, Brussels and Travel
All these words are in Blue in my head
Union
Soviets
Stalin
Everything leads to Stalin eventually
I just picture the European flag
Union
Stars
Safety
I don't get emotional often, but hearing "*Alle Menschen werden Brüder*" just gets to me some way
It's the colour of the council of Europe
Likewise, Etheopia has one of the oldest christian cultures, so they would be European too then
Same here
I am a Belgian living in Sweden and it just feels like Belgium except people speak Swedish and there’s more nature
In french, we have two expressions with "*having balls*" (but no *big*), depending on how you translate *balls*.
*Avoir les boules* (literally balls) means being afraid, while *Avoir les/des couilles* (testicles) means being not afraid, being brave
In Flemish we don't say that someone has 'big' balls but we rather acknowledge they have balls to begin with
• *"Amai, die heeft ballen aan zijn/haar lijf
with extra emphasis on 'ballen'. It roughly means that
• *"Damn
he/she has balls
On the other hand when someone isn't brave at all we say they have no balls at all
* *"Die heeft geen ballen aan zijn/haar lijf
Ballen van staal (balls of steel) is brave in Dutch
In Belgium when I was a kid we used to say "t'as les boules, t'as les glandes ? T'as les crottes de nez qui pendent
" which means "ehh looser you're afraid" or trolling someone like "u mad
Because it's so damn expensive
Austria or Germany have similar views for a lower price
You'll get more bang for your buck there
yo, leman lake is so beautiful though
Only 20% smoke
I don't think there is one general perception about it, but our government has been trying their absolute hardest to decline the number of smokers even further
Years ago smoking was banned in restaurants and more recently there have been campaigns to encourage parents to stop smoking inside since the smoke lingers and damages their kids
Since a few months it's also illegal to smoke if you're in a car with children
As far as my personal perception goes, I dislike it because I can't stand the smell and it is VERY noticeable if somebody just went out to smoke
I saw somewhere that in Amsterdam, of those aged between 18 and 35, a whopping 41% smoked though
How can you guys even afford it with the sigarette prices in the UK
>When we were young, my wife and I both worked in the non-profit sector, and we, in theory, could have transferred to one of the European offices (we were interested in Portugal, Slovakia, and Bulgaria), but the US office was always short-staffed and the timing was never right
Transferring NP work abroad is a pain
IT's really a major dilemma in possibly sacrificing your work for living somewhere more preferable
Why would you do that lol
This
In my experience Francophones are quite rude
Even in Brussels, the French speaking population here are given the reputation of being quite rude and I've heard this complaint not only amongst the expatriate population but also amongst the Flemish
>Well, it wasn't really about the rudeness but the idea that all French people speak English
Oh I didn't see that part
It definitely has not been my experience either
In Brussels even young francophone people speak English very poorly and they tend to be monolingual as well
When I lived in Germany if they noticed you struggling they wouldn't hesitate to speak English, but in Brussels, they tell you that their English is just as shit so you both speak to each other very poorly in the other's language
l’m surprised we haven’t seen the long list of Italian culinary grievances
Ask Belgians if they speak French or Dutch
Both go crazy after that question
We assume you know the right language
To be fair, Holland is Flemish for Nederland
The fact that the Hollanders don't like it is an added perk for some people
Infuriating indeed
And for some reasons, only Belgium is victim of this
We don't see people wanting to split Switzerland
Something equally infuriating: serving beer in the wrong glass
I mean if they asked about Belgium the technically wouldn’t be necessarily wrong
Feel your pain tho
Did you get an answer tho
Lol
I love how equally annoyed and resigned this comment comes off
Saying multiple fries are friet always makes me uncomfortable lol
Friet will always be a singular fry for me
I've got worse:
French Fries
Or saying Swiss chocolate is the best chocolate
Or Heineken
Or the *Dutch*!!
Let's do a switcharoo here
Let your Brabant, Limburg and Zeeuws-Vlaanderen join us in our homely yet lovely mess of a country
In the meantime our prime minister will sing the Marseillaise instead of the Brabançonne
In Antwerp we even have a song [about it]
>!For non-Dutch or Antwerp speeaking people, it's a song about how a bus full of Dutch/Hollanders is the biggest threat to the peace in our country
The Dutch and Belgians are natural enemies
Like Frenchmen and Belgians
Like Germans and Belgians
Like Belgians and other Belgians
Darn Belgians, they ruined Belgium
Belgium doesn't discriminate
We love and hate everything, including our King
If you ever go camping you always find the people you hate (the Dutch) and the people you love (also the Dutch)
Nah, I love our French-speaking wierdos
To be honest, outside of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen and other regions close to the borders we cannot recognise what part of the Netherlands someone comes from unless they tell us
So when we mean Holland we really mean either 75% of the Netherlands or the Netherlands as a whole
Our officials dumped a big load of Mask and the ones that were left were conserved in bad places which cause moisture
I think you know why it’s not really wholesome 100
I have never seen anyone do it here in Belgium
There are some designated beaches but on the regular ones I haven’t seen anyone sunbathing topless
This is not an opinion
There is actual data on this
This article ( [  talks about a French survey about this exact topic
They have the numbers at 48 % in Spain, 34 in Germany and 22 in France
But it is going down
Of the five countries they tested, Spain was the only one that did not show a significant decline
Keep in mind that 'public' is a relative term
In some areas, there might not be all that many people around even when the beach is technically public
Some areas also have specific nude beaches that are semi-closed off but are still technically 'public beaches', which could make the numbers appear lower then they really are (i.e. 'I have never seen it so it has to be low', when in reality, they are all concentrated in one specific location)
Yeah, the article isn't very detailed
The actual study shows the results in way more detail, but it's in French
This is a powerpoint of the actual results: [
Slide 13 basically shows what you're asking (only for France)
They asked whether you ever went topless to the beach
And they give the options 'yes, in the last 3 years (dark blue)', 'yes but not in the last three years (light blue)' and 'no'. But they asked this in specific situations
First about company (partner, female friends and male friends) and then about location (deserted beach, low crowded beach and crowded beach)
Not surprisingly, 'deserted beach' and 'in front of partner' have way higher numbers
Public beach in the last 3 years is at only 5 %. There is also a ton of data about sexual orientation, political affiliation, religion, age,...
So as you might expect, the number is quite high if you include 'everyone who has ever taken their top of in front of their partner or close (female) friends on a deserted beach', but if you go to 'regularly going topless on crowded beaches', the numbers are way lower
Around 50 % is probably a good guess for the first situation
For the second, it's somewhere in the single digits
This is like more expensive than what the german guy said for this price you can go on vacation to germany and buy a falcon and go back
Wow,belgium is expensive
Wasn't orban doing something with over hours
Thats fucked up
I totally understand the Googling
If you know a complete stranger will come and live in your home, you might just be curious about this person and you also might want to be (mentally) prepared for what kind of person to expect
It doesn't seem that strange to do a quick Google search
I wouldn't mention it that I Googled you
If for some reason they find it important to know and talk about what they read, they should have found another way of bringing it up
Maybe just ask about your parents or home situation in the US and see how you reacted to it
I might understand that they wanted to be honest and fair by telling you
'Hey actually we Googled you and we saw ... we were wondering ...' But if you do go that far, then you do that in a private conversation between you and the family without any outsiders present
I don't really see any problem in this
I would call this pretty much expected behaviour
And I can't speak for all host families in the entire continent, it's just for myself
Keep in mind that you are living with those people, in their house, for probably a long time
That's much, much more heavy on privacy in any way than doing a quick google search
> Can I attribute it to the “bluntness” of the culture
I don't think so
The way you feel about it doesn't have a lot to do with any culture
It's probably just your personality
It might take some time, but unfortunately you'll have to find a way to deal with it, it happens a lot that people you might or might not know bring it up
It's not to offend you
My husband's parents did the same to me when I first started dating him (Belgian )
They also regularly search their childrens' names and mine online to see what comes up even though we're adults
Old English : asideca few words here and there, can't understand it
Scots : I get the global idea
The others are fine
My mother tongue is Dutch and I'm pretty much fluid in English, and I couldn't understand a word from old English
That being said, I don't understand much of the oldest Dutch texts either
The first two examples are OK, but the rest is just ksncoanfnaoncKgssgss
The last version (Scots
) was OK too
I can't speak for the Dutch, but I had class on The Canterbury Tales and Shakespeare in secondary school
Plus class on Middle-Dutch
["Van den vos Reynaerde"] was a blast to read
So we got some practice in school
Early modern and middle English aren't that bad to read
They still look a lot like Modern English except for phrasings and individual words
Old English makes very little sense to me (I think it's more Norse-related than Germanic)
I don't think the ease of reading comes from that necessarily, or from knowing Dutch
I think it's just the English isn't *that* different and depending on your language skills one can make a better translation than an other
In Belgium we get presents from a guy in blackface
Or a bushel of twigs if you were a bad boy/girl
He's enslaved by this Turkish bishop who's actually white
Go figure
Oh dear, you've never heard French official speak english
Make that the cat wise
LOL
Hello Congo, how are you doing today
Our king's backyard was a big patch of land called Congo, the rest is history
Cutting of the hands of people who didn't work hard enough, genocides
It was bad
What happened in the Congo Free State is a pretty obvious one
Congo was colonized to satiate the ego of our megalomaniac King Leopold II
Local people were exploited to death, with harsh punishment if they didn't meet the quotas (infamous hand chopping, death
The treatment of Congo was so terrible that even other colonizing nations found it inhumane and over the top, to the point that the Belgian government was forced to take it over instead of the King
Estimations of the death toll vary wildly because of the absence of a census, but they range from a few millions to 15 millions, with 10 millions as a commonly accepted figure
Leopold II
My grandfather had to move from Silesia too, but we don't know more about that
He was born in what was called Hindenburg back then
And Kosovo
Considering the comments I see every time gypsies are mentioned on /r/europe, I think that this policy would be quite popular with the reddit crowds
Probably Leopolds II and The Congo
Also, the level of corruption in the Dutroux affair
Nothing's lower than crimes against kids
Chop Chop
*laughs in Belgian*
Which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't persecuted us and been asshole to us as a whole
Treat people like second grade citizens with less rights than others, and a revolt is the least you can expect
RYAN STARTED THE FIRE
You forgot about Iceland it seems, quite sure they suffered even more than Norway under your rule
They were the poorest nation of Western/Northern Europe due to the trade monopoly Denmark was forcing on them
Lentedip klinkt dan weer als iets om op een cracker te smeren
Same to ward of the spirit of Winter and thing like that, haven't got the chance to go to one in a long time though
We have the same thing in Mechelen (and Heist-op-den-berg), but with a different song ( *Sinte-Mette van de Ruggenuchte)
*  The last years it's loosing the competition against the imported Halloween
A Belgian that doesn’t like fries
My cousin doesnt like chocolate
Belgian that hates beer and doesnt give a single fuck about football: me
A Belgian "not really into fries"
I'm a Belgian person who does not like beer
A Belgian who doesn't drink beer or doesn't eat fries
A french person who supports government-proposed social reforms
Does that person exist
Or one that doesn't watch football/cyclocross/cycling
Same here
Are Germans known for their beer
Bread is French
Believe it or not but this very rare species does in fact exist
I am ‘one’
Less and less people like watching sports though
I get the joke but honestly fries in France are shit, like everywhere outside of Belgium
You have to fry them twice ffs
As for Belgian
Don't we all
Could be , I travel a lot in Europe but I've stopped trying to find decent fries a while ago
There's nothing like coming home and have your first meal home at your favorite friterie/frituur
There is no better way to eat fried potatoes than in a Belgian friture
Perfectly normal, I didn't know Americans use mopeds
Après-ski > skiing
Well it's a big part of our food culture as well, as we eat it twice a day
And unlike most countries we still buy our bread in bakeries instead of supermarkets
How dare you tell a Belgian how to fry his potatoes
It's like telling an Italian how to make pizza
Edit:
for Belgian fries: You just fry them for a bit, let them cool off, either freeze them in or fry them again, done
The kind of potato is very important tho
Mfw someone unironically says that freezing fries before baking them is a good way to make fries
Pretty much the same in Europe
You're lucky I'm open minded and maybe I'll give it a try but don't disrespect us like that again
In Dutch, both are female
Strange, as it's so close to German
Hold on
The sun takes a nap at night
I'll let myself out
Absolutely correct
For Belgium I would say the 1880's till 1914
Economically we were a powerhouse, we had colonies, we were the second industrialised country in the world and brought innovation and technology to the world
Ofcourse people did not have voting rights or there was a voting system where the rich had more votes than the poor, so socially there were a lot of problems
It came to a halt when the Germans took our entire industry sector away
Just reading this made the Kingdom Come intro play in my head
Definitly not a Golden Age for one half of the country
Dutch as a language was banned, including from schools
Industry was built up in Wallonia, not in Flanders, making it richer than Flanders and causing massive migration
Overall i dont think we have had a Golden Age, not as "Belgium" at least
I don’t think colonies of any kind should be a reason for a “golden age”. Quite the opposite actually
We even use it in Dutch
Well, most countries do not have a golden age then
There was always suppression in the past and if we are to count that we also just have to count all of the poor people who were suppressed and then noone ever had a golden age
Belgium as a nation was mighty and was in the top of technology and power, laying railroads in places as far as Astrakhan and Caïro
It was very golden age-ish, but people suffered, as they have everywhere at all times in history
There is always poor and oppressed people, but generally the main population is doing okay if its a Golden Age
In Belgium during that time, only the 1% elite really did good for themselves
Thats why i dont wanna call it a Golden Age
No matter how far in technology and power (which neighbouring countries had more of at the time) we were, a majority of the native population was heavily oppressed
I'd hardly call laying railroads in Egypt and building trams in a Chinese city a Golden Age
Just fyi, Astrakhan is in Russia ;)
And I wouldn't say so
Englands golden age was during Elizabeths reign, a time where catholics where heavily oppressed and the general populace was poor and dying all the time
Golden ages from those times are mostly calculated by the elite, the art, the power and technology of a country
During this time we excelled in those 4 categories
I agree with you it would have been a horrible time to live in, but golden ages are often not that fun
Thats just history for ya
Oh i wasnt talking about Astrakhan haha, we built some trams for a decade about a century ago in some Chinese city near Beijing
Forgot the name, Tianjing maybe
Tsingtao
Anyway
Well, technology wise we werent really that amazing at the time, and art and literature didnt do well at all either at the time given the massive oppression and culture killing government
We werent militarily strong either at the time, so really all you have is a rich and colonial elite
Hardly a Golden Age, even by those standards you mentioned
That bout of Montezuma's revrnge doesnt count sice that was in Colombia so Id say that nasty cold I got while on vacation in Montenegro
Having a cold with fever in a hot climate when not in your comfortable home sucks
As a kid I was basically always in the water
I have home videos of my grandparents and me looking angry when I was like 4 because we were going to a market instead of swimming, I wanted to swim damned
Every year I had an ear infection
Several years later we went to Rose, Spain
It had a dirty pool
You couldn't really see underwater
I now work with swimming pools and I shudder to think how that thing was maintained, or the lack of it
Knowing how fucking easy it is to keep a pool clear
My parents also hired a speedboat
Outside of the swimming area at the beaches there were entire groups of jellyfish, the big red ones
Thousands of them
So me on the front of the boat, wind in my ears for like 30minutes - 1hour
Yea, we went back a few days earlier than planned because of my ears when it started to hurt 2 days later
Normal medication I got from our house doctor didn't do shit and my mother, a nurse, pulled the alarm
The next day after my mother decided that I saw one of those "I studied until 35 to learn about ears" type of deals
Not a fun experience overall and as a result I have a swimming pool in my backyard of 15x5x1
5 meters and I've swum maybe twice in the last 3 years
Never been robbed or anything in Europe
Worst trip for me was Vietnam
Nothing super bad but i went to disneyland paris and it was hyper cold at the time the coldest winter in many years
I'd say it's good for you
Plenty of people think Paris is the only thing worth visiting in France
While it's certainly a pretty city and interesting cultural wise, the rest of the country has plenty to offer as well and the people outside of Paris are lovely
This might be a mith in our city but during WW2 our city was one of the only one's not sabotaged by either the Germans or the resistance because they hid it somehow
They're very proud of that fact
My school was a hospital for the Germans during WW2
>Limburg
Do they have a Limburg everywhere lol
Of course that happens in Belgium
Hey I saw that in the news
Yep that sounds like Denmark
What city
It _was_ a Mercedes-Benz
Even though our roads are terrible, there are constantly road works
Yes of course
Fill the holes with bumps and fix the bumps with holes
Belgium, many parts of Wallonia are beautiful but with no tourists, as tourists almost exclusively go to Flanders
Western Wallonia : Mons,Tournai,the canal of Centre with the hydraulic elevators,the "Fagne" area,Chimay area (and his famous beer made by monks),etc and it's a land of folklore
I think that it would be very nice  for those who want to think outside the box in Belgium
I was in Sumava National Park and I enjoyed a lot,few tourists
Is that really true
I thought the Ardennes, Mons, Liege, Spa and the Caves of Han-sur-Lesse werr visited often
It is mostly local tourism (mostly flemish), but not international
Due to a lack of international publicity (or negative publicity) you have places in Wallonia where, for example Dutch or German tourists will drive past to France, and local businesses would often say "they are driving past the area to go somewhere in Lorraine or Champagne, to a place that is less beautiful, further away and more expensive
I know this is not really what OP asked but I'll still say it
Try to know at least some basic words of most common languages in Europe and definitely when you are going to a different country for a trip
A 'thank you' or 'good morning' could make a big difference on how someone percieves you
I was ones in a little french restaurant near the Italian border and we thought that the owner had a different french accent
We figured out that he was probably from Italy and when he served us we all started to say 'Grazie'.
His mood suddenly changed and he started smiling and saying 'Prego'. That night we got a free dessert and some free limoncello he made
We went back more than a week later and he still remembered us
Making us feel the most welcome out of all his customers
So yeah, most people have no idea how much everyone appreciates trying to speak your language
The little effort it takes can make a person's day
Most higher-paying jobs here in Belgium require you to be at least bilingual (Dutch/French + English) and many trilingual (Dutch, French and English
German is also a very important language if you work in an industrial or trade-related setting
Spanish may be interesting if you work in tourism and so might be Italian, but otherwise most other languages are only useful in niche contexts
Depends on what your exact plans are
If you'll be living in a country, the main language of that country is helpful
If you want something that's useful in general, business-wise, French might be the way to go
Most people who deal with international stuff speak English well enough, but French-speakers are a bit notorious for speaking French-only
I've worked with people from the Netherlands, Germany, France, England, Spain and India and the French tended to have the most issues with communication
It depends on your region even the best european languages like German or french wont help you in Poland or Italy so i would just learn the language of the country you are going to work in
Just finished my second year of Russian in night school
Basic conversations, going to a restaurant or hotel, finding something in a shop, showing someone around in my city,... are all doable
Tried finding the post office and buying stamps in Kiev, that was more of a challenge but worked out in the end
Fluency is a looong way off
I have a Russian penpal who I text with occasionally but I have to use a google translate half the time even though we're keeping the Russian on a "simple" level
The only way to get really fluent in it is to be fully immersed constantly, I think
If someone learnt german in school for economic necessity, he would not be a native speaker
So actually, what you say is not true
Amazes me too, and the reasons people of nations without an ID card mention against implementing an ID card for all citizens
We don't congratulate the family for their child birthday for starters, that's just weird "congratulations you made your child survive X years
" Saying gefeliciteerd to anyone but the birthday girl/boy is very weird to me
We do have snacks and bites like you do and sit together but it's not always in a circle, we usually sit around the table or in the sofa
The flemish government and flemish community government are merged together so we only have 6 governments
Dutroux in Belgium
Even more than Leopold II
Dutroux
He kidnapped several early-teen girls, raped them and then starved them to death in his basement
If he was released from prison today, he would be found death within a day
A person that knew about what was happening got released from prison last year and he was beat up badly within a week
Belgians despise Dutroux, rightfully so
Leopold 2 or Dutroux
Dutroux probably the most because it’s more ‘recent’.
Some bearded fella with a passion for hands
Leopold 2
And also Dimitri Bontinck, he tried to become famous on his extremist son
He's a cunt
Marc Dutroux
Whenever we go to germany, Atemlos is our song
Mostly because of alcohol
Leopold ||| is also on the list I'm pretty sure
I think most Belgians don't know jack shit about what Leopold the second did
Dutroux is definitly more hated
Ding, dong the witch is dead
Do you guys like, don't hate Putin
Mmmh
Recently I'd say Marc Dutroux
In the past, I'd say leopold the 3rd as he was a coward
Leo 2nd did a lot of bad things, undeniably, but he put Belgium in the Map (at the cost millions of lives, I know)
Dimitri Bontinck is definitely an attention whore, but I don't think many people actively hate him
To Bontinck: "I don't even know who you are"
I guess he didn't get **that** famous after all
>  Dimitri Bontinck
As a Belgian, I have never heard about him, quite sure most Belgian have never heard of him either
He doesn't even have a Wikipedia page, nor in French nor in English
You know you can do roman numerals using the i/I right
Definitely
I just feel that a lot of people don't know about the horrors of Leopold III
Many people don't even know about the horrors of Leopold II either
It's something that older mothers would say here too
Like age 50+.
Really
I've always thought he was a bit infamous in other countries, especially compared to other killer rapists
I'm pretty sure most Belgians now at least a little bit about what happened in Congo
I'm 17 and I have heard of him for years and I never watch the news
A little, but not enough for hatred at all
Ask a random person on the street who in the history of Belgium was most hated, most won't say Leopold 2
You are Flemish
Yeah that's true
Yes
That's why you have heard about him then
He is not famous at all in Wallonia, since he doesn't even have a Wikipedia article in French, and not even in English, and nearly all links in Google search are in Dutch
He is thus irrelevant internationally
Yeah sometimes I forget how different Flanders and Wallonia are (in terms of news and stuff)
I'm pretty sure everyone knows about what he did in Congo
I think for Flanders it is very hard because we can notice immediately from which part of the country tje the natives are because of our many dialects
And mastering dutch +mastering the local tongue is very hard
it is very funny that newcomers don't learn standard Dutch, they learn the local dialect
Nigh impossible
Dutch has this weird thing with adjectives and articles
There are literally no rules about them
Native dutch speakers "feel" which one is correct, but you obviously don't have that as a non-native speaker
I think it's almost impossible to fully know the language
There are a lot of foreigners who live here for decades but still make mistakes with using 'de' instead 'het'. But that's understandable
>e.g. there is no 'dt' rule, there only is stem+t, whatever that stem may be
My whole life is a lie
I feel like dt mistakes are made more by native speakers than by people who learn Dutch
Ik wordt daar echt niet goed van
Bit late to answer but in Belgium the phrase you find weird is used more than the other one
If they can make it work then yeah sure I would love it
I wouldn't really want to get it if the system is half-assed though because that could possibly mean economic disaster
Could be good for my allergy, I have severe allergy to work
Someone or the Belgian subreddit posted the employment contract from someone in late 19th century
Those people had to bring their own coal to the factory and heat the place up in their own spare time before work
So yeah seeing where we stand now I know it will be reality sooner or later
But research has shown a 4 day work week doesn't necessary translate to less productivity
Obvious exceptions in factories etc
Edit: in fact, in can lead to an increase in productivity, source:
>Two-thirds of voters reportedly rejected an increase in the country's minimum annual leave from four weeks to six, which would have brought it in line with most other West European countries
so it's not that hard to pay for
* Thank you UK, France, Poland, Canada and US for saving our asses during both world wars
* Also thank you UK for supporting our independence and helping us grow into one of the first countries tot industrialise
* Thank you The Netherlands and Luxembourg for being the best neighbours someone could wish for
* Thank you Norway for being such a splendid country with nice people
Thank you to every country that helped in the liberation of Belgium and others occupied by Nazi’s. Especially thankful to Canada because of which the street I live in is what it is today
They rode in Brugge liberating it in the process
The place they entered the city was none other then what we know call the Canada brug
On which ever lasting words of thanks are adorned
Yeah, i would like to thank Italy for inventing Nutella
Appearantly the Ferrero family is amongst the richest families in Italy
This is a disgrase,
they should be the richest family in the world for inventing Nutella
Italy: I LIVE FOR YOUR FOOD + Latin culture
Greec: old Greek culture
France: Baguette
Turkey: Your bread
England: your accent is so funny
Thank you for not forgetting us in that battle
Thank you for always being on our side when war loomed, even if it meant going against the odds in the beginning
Thank you for starting the industrial revolution (twice) and spreading it to Belgium so we could become the first country with trains outside of the British Isles
Thank you UK for saving our asses during both world wars and supporting our independence in 1830
Yeah,  thanks for that
I can understand German and Afrikaans, but as someone from Limburg don't ask me to translate West-Vlaams (West-Flemish) because that's like Chinese to me
Spoken, I can barely understand the Limburgish and West Flemish dialects of Dutch (or languages)
I sometimes have trouble understanding people from the Northern Netherlands if they have a thick accent
Afrikaans is also very hard, even if they talk slowly
Not a chance I would understand German
Written, I can understand pretty much everything of all the dialects
I can understand most of Afrikaans and a bit of German (maybe 10-20%) and Frisian
Une bière svp, een pintje aub, una cervesa por favor, bitte ein bier,... I'm all-round
Might want to use languages instead of countries
I think my dutch as a Flemish person is as good as a dutch person :p.
Anyway, Dutch and South-African is more or less a yes
Father made a joke at the expense of my mother at the entrance of one of the wine gardens/castles near Cape Town and the girl standing there to greet us burst out laughing :p.
Written German makes me get the gist
Just don't ask details
Spoken if I really pay attention, some of it
I never studied German but depending on the subject can understand anywhere between 10 to 40% I guess
And we can speak it like Jean-Marie Pfaff lol
You better put us in the same lists as the Netherlands, since more than half the country speaks Dutch (there's even a German minority, but I'll let that slide)
To answer your question, I can often get the general meaning in Afrikaans and German, but there certainly are words and sentences I don't understand at all
**Belgian** : I can understand France French and, Swiss French, and they understand us too, except maybe for a few regional/slang words here and there
For Canadian French it's a bit tricky, although I think they have the ability to tone it down so that it's very understandable for us Europeans
For example I can watch Canadian Youtubers and understand them perfectly, but Canadian TV shows are a bit hard to follow
For the French in Luxembourg I feel like it's mostly spoken by French and Belgian expats so again, it's easily understood
Romanian is not understandable by French speakers
Some similarities will make it apparent it's a romance/latin language, but it's very different from French
I can speak for Dutch too
Afrikaans is its own language
It has Dutch roots but it has changed significantly
A Dutch person will catch words here and there and maybe figure out the general meaning of sentences but it's not like both languages are mutually intelligible
For German, there are a lot of similarities but again, they are different languages
Most Dutch people know some German through school as well
Easy sentences will be understood by Dutch people, but for some reason, the same cannot be said when it comes to Germans understanding Dutch
> France/French Canada (Québec)/Belgium/Luxembourg/Switzerland
Yes as long we use french but well if it's a german swiss that doesn't use french or a flemish belgian that does the same then it's obviously harder
Flemish (Dutch) Belgian here
i can understand most south african as long as its not too quick
most different words can be derived from context and most verbs are almost exactly the same
German is a bit harder, but if you can speak dutch and english, german is understandable, again, if its not too fast or the german is too angry :P
Belgian French, Luxembourg French and Regular french are (almost) exactly the same
Its like the difference between British, American and Australian
the only difference im aware of between Belgium and France is: septante instead of soixante-dix/nonante instead of quatre-vingt-dix
I understand on the Luxembourg (Dialect) side, Luxembourg, German, Afrikaans (i think) bit not Dutch nor Flemish
On the French side, Walloon (some from Heinaut and Namur, not Liege) French, not Corsican, I somewhat understand Breton, Quebec
I don't remember the name of the American French language but i will listen to it if someone show me some piece
Maar ik kom uit Brabant en ik begrijp u goed, zenne
West-Vlaams is more of a dialect of Vlaams
I'm form Flanders and French is indeed an official language that you learn, but if you never use that language in your everyday life, but only in school, you will not learn that language
I can understand French, but only basic stuff
Don't ask me to have a conversation in French because that's something I can't really do
As for German, that language isn't mandatory for everyone in school
I only had German for 2 years in school
I can understand it because it is very similar to the dialect from my region in Flanders, Limburg
West-Flemish if spoken on television will have subtitles
Might be similar to other countries but I don't know so I'll explain it here to give you an idea
If you take a city like Ghent, where I went to school, the dutch teacher could tell which one of the 14 regions of Ghent you came from by the way you talk
I wasn't from Ghent, I was from 30 kilometers away
(studied IT which my local high school didn't offer) The guy heard me talk and knew where I was from, a small town of 10k 30 kilometers away
The guy in our class from Brugge, capital of West-Flanders, we often had problems understanding as he often spoke West-Flemish
For example, he used "two and a half" to mean 14
30 instead of "half three", leading to some confusion on occasion
We're all capable of talking simple dutch
But it's not really how we talk with friends in most cases
When talking about Belgium, you are supposed to be confused
The saying here goes that if you think you understand Belgium, the explanation you got was no good
I wish people would stop holding up the myth of "Vlaams" being a language
The official languague is standardized Dutch, following the rules of the language union
Then people from the Netherlands usually say "Vlaams" to refer to either a huge range of dialects, which can be divided into 3 groups (real "Vlaams" including West- and East- Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish) or the "Tussentaal" which is mostly Dutch with some language features that most of these dialects have in common (such as the use of ge/gij instead of je/jij and saying u a hell of a lot)
Neither these dialects nor the tussentaal have standardized forms though
So TL:DR it's time to stop saying we speak Vlaams and admit we speak Dutch, albeit with dialectic features or regional variations
Because there is no standardized form of "Vlaams", people refer to different things when they say they speak Vlaams and the exact way we speak differs widely depending on the region
We all learn standard Dutch in school though and know perfectly well how to speak it as our mother tongue
I've edited: "een pintje aub" is in dutch
[West-Flemish subtitles (Dutch only)]
I think this fits here perfectly
Hahaha that's so true
I always see it as follows: I speak Dutch with a Flemish accent with influences from my local dialect which is between Kempisch and Antwerps
So it will be:
Language: Dutch
Accent: Flemish
Dialect: Kempisch/Antwerps
Or in short, a form of tussentaal with influences from Antwerp/Kempen
Yes that one
Yes i can understand it but it sounds a bit more archaic than Quebecois (less developed)
"Dat konnemi vorstelle datte de verstehst"
As the other guy said, basically dutch dialect
"Da kun(ne)ke me nie voorstelle datte/daje da versta(t)"(I mean, multiple options)
The above is plain dialect heavy dutch
Aub= please
Als het u belieft means st like if it pleases you
All the time
What happens in the US these last couple of years generates so much heat that journalists just have to pick up on it
We're all living in America
Here is the website of a quality reputable Belgian newspaper: [
The categories are Recent | Domestic | American Elections | International | Opinion
This is from a country which is still forming its own government, we have quite a bit of political crises at home and in Europe
I think European news is most lacking
You have to be quite a politics nut to know the internal politics of your neighbouring countries beyond simply the heads of state
I know more representatives and senators from the US than European MEPs, or Dutch or French or German parliamentarians combined
Not all that much actually, the elections arent really covered this year, because  we still have no gouvernemt since 2018 or so and corona
Since 2016 almost every day, every time
It gets old tbh
Our news often talks about the US when Trump makes a stupid remark or when the covid cases do something funny, or when some maniac shoots up a bunch of people again
So yeah, too much
This
I swear some papers must have a journalist whose only duty is to follow Trump on Twitter and make an article every time he says something stupid
True
And there's a looooot of stupid things to report on
Football, not American football
And that's basically a topic year round
August to May is play, June and Juli are transfer and transfer rumors as well as international games often
This is the only sub about Europe that isn t full of Americans telling us how we're being "replaced"
And people here are much nicer in general, of course
I feel like I do have quite a strong feeling of European identity for where I live
I feel more European than I do Flemish or Beneluxian (if that’s even a word, but not more than I do Belgian
That being said though I don’t think a European state is possible or desirable because of all the differences we still have between countries and regions
It seems too cumbersome to iron them out for the supposed benefits and I also just would not like it
If you don't believe a ''European identity'' exists, you're wrong
Just play dragostea din tei to any European
This might not be absolute proof of a single European identity, but it does show certain aspects of culture al over Europe have somehow merged together
This providing a base for a European identity, on top of whatever national or regional identity you already have
idk about that, i always thought the great thing about europe is that we can feel slighty connected with neighbouring countries but every country is still pretty different and unique
Wait what sarcasm
This song unites europe
It's not a particularly good song, but every European has heard it and had it stuck in their head at some point in their life
Too bad, while the BENELUX was the one who basically started the EU, so its countries should have more attention on them, even considering Brussels is sometimes considered the de facto capital of the EU (Wich is not the case , there really is no capital)
As somebody from Belgium who went a week to Manhattan(holiday) and a week to Miami(work)
Way bigger divide between men and women(feeling only really but as a 20 year old guy the entire thing was kind of creepy on more than one occasion
Some things American women seemed to be ok with that would just not fly over here)
How workers are treated
I would laugh and walk out with some of the things they ask employees to do there
That entire culture of "money" that is everywhere to a dumb degree
Watched an NBA game and the basket seemed to be a side activity, left during 3rd quarter
I'm on a plane to Tennessee, let me advertise to you(captive audience much
Overly social for me(more of a personal thing)
Not allowed to be drunk in public
Again, Belgian here, everything around alcohol is weird over there
My father was drunk as fuck on Miami South Beach but luckily nothing happened
The food
Omg, the fucking food
Yes I'm sure there is plenty of good shit
But that bottom layer cheap food here in Belgium can still be recognized as food
Not so much in the US
Finding actually BAD food is a challenge in most European countries I've visited
The loads of non-fresh food in the US makes even basic meals awful
Second worst place to have a quick bite to eat after my holiday in Vietnam
Again, not talking actual non-chain restaurants which are as good as anywhere else
Haha no worries
Maybe it's limited to my circles
Sexy dressed waitresses to lure costumers isn't really a thing here
The entire "cheerleader" thing, when we walked out of the NBA game we walked past a bunch of 6-12 year old girls in cheerleader outfits
The entire thing just felt seedy to me
That's the best word to describe it I think, seedy, poor, in bad taste, something like that
Again, nothing I'm saying here is objective but in higher class/more expensive places I've visited in Europe(London, Paris, Rome, etc
) female employees didn't try to have their tits hang out
Sex and high class don't really mix from my perspective in the context I'm thinking about
I'd say something about Belgium but
There really isn't anything touristy
Maybe manneke pis
A statue of a peeing boy of half a metre with so many asians around it you can't even see it
The Bulgarian coast has become a quick favorite with my friends the last two years
It's cheaper than going to some party beach in Spain and thus getting more popular
Sorry :(
Netherlands or France
France I would say, they are somehow disliked or seen as annoying by both Walloons and Flemings
Maybe Flemings will say the Netherlands, but Walloons don't care about the Netherlands
The Dutch for sure
It depends, most Wallonians despise Frenchies due to the fact that Belgians are the butthole of many French jokes and are perceived as the "inherently stupid northerners".
The Flemish would probably say that the Netherlands are their biggest rivals, but I think that their rivalry isn't as intense as the one between Wallonia and France
And as a Brusselaar, the logical choice would be both, but since most of us are native French-speakers and are more influenced by French culture, I would probably say France
I'm personally not really into this rivalry with our southern neighbor, I don't hate Frenchies, but I definitely despise Parisians
But then again, so do most non-Parisians in France :')
I thought Italy was your natural predator
Do we mean nothing to you
I disagree
You must be from the other side of the language border
Didn't know there was any love between the two of you
200km*
yes, and like a little brother we're the butt of most of your jokes
Also because of the cultural influence
Many Walloons know French celebrities, watch French television and movies, etc
while the contrary is not true
Another example: when speaking with French friends I made on the internet, me being up to date with that tiny thing what has been happening in their internal politics is considered normal whilst I don't expect them to know the name of our King
Maybe it has also something the « p'tits belges » expression
I don't know, as far as I recall (I'm 24), the stereotype has always been that French people are haughty and disdainful braggers
I also think wanting to win against France has to do with a sort of inferiority complex
As I've said, I made many friends who live « outre-Quiévrain », I'm just talking about general reasons for any possible rivalry, I love you guys
yes,although I was in the air when we lost to you guys, so the pilot was literally giving us updates on the game (we were flying Brussels airlines) and the stewardesses were dressed in our flag's colour's
It's just jokes about each other yeah so it's a friendly rivalry
That's a hard truth but it leaves us with the possibility of being Rival with France
This hurts my feelings
Haha the Dutch make jokes about Belgians being dumb and the Belgians make jokes about the dutch being cheapskates
I am Belgian and Dutch so I’m both I guess
I don't think most Belgians like you back hahaha
>some of you sometimes brag on things we do exactly the same (or better) but on reddit then they pass as french only
Do you have some examples
I love how in the final even the journalists and analists were clearly for Croatia and didn't want France to win
(I agree though)
I find it quite funny to see my country Belgium has deeply held rivalries with two countries (Netherlands and France) and the other two don't even realize it
It's like we're a puppy barking angrily at the two neighbouring houses and they just say: "Ooh, look how cute it is
It's no rivalry, a lot of Belgians just really don't like the Dutch
Percieved as arrogant
And we hate the French because they speak the same language as the 'Walen" and we hate Wallonia
Fun times
Edit: this is an observation
I woulf very much like to move to the Netherlands because I love Amsterdam and the Dutch mentality
Just to say but we are both student and I am also named Arthur
Your national monument is a windmill
And don't forget your countrymen in Limburg are catholics too
Well, if it is any concern, I like you
And we know we are a mess, and goddamn if it won't come to bite us in the ass one of these days
And you better believe it will be a direct bother
If it is any consolation, I am a real fan of your country
Amsterdam is just amazing
My therapist: dont worry, Californian wine doesn't exist
Californian wine:
And because they stole our fries
It makes some people very nationalistic towards Flanders and some people very anti-nationalist
> Since beer is lower ABV
You mean bad beers/pisswater beers (what most of Europe has), real/good/Belgian beer is as, if not sometimes more drunkenness-inducing, than wine
Ours beers are often at around 8-9°, with some going up to 10°. Malheur and Bush are at 12°.
I'd doubt that
A couple of years ago a Belgian boy drowned in the shower because he passed out drunk in it
In the U.S.:
Los Angeles
The city is ugly/superficial/disingenous and
tacky
Las Vegas: a complete shithole/tacky/.
Europe:
I agree with you about Ibiza/Mallorca/Magaluf and all other typical British youth holiday destinations
Just seems like a shit show of tackiness and obnoxious drunk people
London
I think this city underwhelmed me the most of any that I've ever been to
It's just
meh to me and I also found it quite ugly and not very nice on the eyes in relation to most of its architecture
Food is good though
Asia:
Bali
I think the hipsters have turned this place into a cliche
Granted I think if you stick to the places that locals go it would be a beautiful experience, but too many westerners are going there and ruining it with these overpriced yoga retreats and other nonsense
Bali was such a let down
It might be nice to spend your honeymoon there in a super luxuary suite without breaking the bank, but to discover the island, it was kinda disappointing
The other islands of Indonesia are way nicer
Edit: I'm a backpacker btw, so I don't like staying in resorts etc
I love meeting locals
Every place below the South of France during the summer
It’s too fucking hot
I also don’t see the point in visiting Barcelona, Miami, Las Vegas, Dubai/Abu Dhabi, Rio de Janeiro etc
Either too fake or tourist traps
Also: the niagara falls are such a scam
I always thought it was located in the middle of nature and stuff, how surprised I was to find out it’s in the middle of Canadian Las Vegas
Venice is terribly overrated
If you're planning on going to Italy I recommend Florence
That city is breathtakingly beautiful imo
Would go back any time I had the chance
I think British facades are quite ugly imo
The drab color of most of the homes does nothing for me in addition to the uninspiring brick
Re: public transport
The tube is definitely outdated
It reminds me of the Parisian metro
It is hands down the worst metro experience I've had to date, especially during the summer time
Disgustingly hot, stifling and just plain inefficient
I don't know, London just didn't have an overt energy/vibe that I got from a lot of other cities that I've visited like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin
I didn't spend too much time doing tourist things either in fact, I spent a lot of time all over the city and away from the "center" but when I went to these other enclaves I didn't feel like I was in London, if that makes sense
It just felt like any other place
Perhaps my expectations were too high
I loved the food and the cultural diversity the most, but the city as a whole made me realize that I personally wouldn't want to live there
Since I'm Jamaican it would have been nice to consider since it has a heavy Jamaican population and is quite a worldly city but
I don't know
Why
Made a roadtrip in California and it’s breathtakingly beautiful
Nothing can beat Yosemite and Lake Tahoe
Even Napa Valley is beautiful
I was raised in NYC and it really bothers me when people compare L.A to NYC
They are not the same and I think NYC has way more to offer and is a better example of what a city should be like than L.A (how can you look at that traffic and call it a city is beyond me)
People are blinded by the weather, but that's really all that it has to offer in my personal/heavily biased opinion
Can't blame them for attracting so many tourists
The place is stunning
In my personal opinion access to functioning/frequent public transportation and accessibility are key functions of a major city
The idea that you live in a city and almost need to own a vehicle is odd
Exactly
I lived in W. NY in a "city" where having a car was almost necessary
By my definition that is not a real city if you need a car to function
Just call it a small town
NYC is the best example of a real city because you literally do not need a car to live there
This is all based on my opinion
It's not a real city if you need a car
Work on the infrastructure and public transportation
It's unacceptable to live in a major city and have to need a car it literally defeats the purpose of living in a city
One that immediately comes to mind is
(DE) Schlimm, bad
(NL) Slim, smart
It can be pretty funny when something bad happens and a German speaker learning Dutch says 'that was smart' accidentally, or when a Dutch person is describing someone in German and says they're 'very bad', while they meant to say 'smart' .
Dutch from the Netherlands ‘poepen’ : to defecate
Dutch from Flanders ‘poepen’: having penetrative sex
Can become awkward
The first that comes to mind is
fabriek (dutch for factory)
fabric (stof in dutch)
Dutch in Dutch is Nederlands, but German in Dutch is Duits, meanwhile German in German is Deutsch and Dutch in German is Niederländisch
Everyone still following
Our hotel guy once told us that, so interesting
It's a minefield
I'd add actually (english, in reality) and actuellement (french, as of right now) which caused me some trouble
Some more false friends between French and English that tripped me up or amused me:
- Inhabité means uninhabited, not inhabited
- Une nouvelle means a short story, not a novel
- Un avertissement means a warning, not an advertisement
- Un coin means a corner, not a coin
- Tissus means fabric, not tissue
- Librairie means book store, not library
- (Culinary:) Entrée means starter, not entree
And in English slim means small or skinny
A slim person, een slimme persoon, and eine schlimme Person mean wildly different things
'Eng' can also mean narrow in Dutch, but it's a much more formal way of speaking and mostly confined to fixed expressions
For example: 'in de enge zin' = 'in its narrow sense'
To top it off: in Dutch, gift can mean both those things
Middag also happens to be the Dutch word for noon
Afaik 'gift' only has the English meaning in Dutch, but usually restricted to money
Poison in Dutch is 'gif' or 'vergif', without the 't', but the verb is still 'vergiftigen', so there's that
I love living in Belgium, it's my home, I know the country very well and feel a strong collection
Lot's of foreigners like to hate on Belgium but I feel like they hardly ever have a strong case against our country
It's mostly ideological, political, and other nitpicks that are big deals in theory but don't actually matter in day to day life
However, I would also love to live in a country with more great nature, and water for swimming and kayaking, Belgium has almost none of that
Canada, Germany and France are the countries I would consider
It's fine
All of our problems are really first world problems
For years I played with the idea of moving somewhere to make a difference but I became too cynical (in part due to my country)
For now, I'll stick to visiting, but I might would like to move somewhere with more of a national unity (but not unhealthy nationalism)
Issues here are so divisive, I'd like to live somewhere where people get along more easily
Also just in day-to-day life where making friends after your school years is basically impossible
Go to the r/askeurope mainpage, on the right you can edit your flair
Yeah Brussels really isn't the place to move to
I think it's much better in cities more to the north and not too big, like Ghent
I live: 15 mins from Bruges, 1h from Brussels, 2 hours from Rotterdam, 3 hours from Paris and Amsterdam and 4 hours from London
I really can’t complain
Newsflash: criminals and the mafia don't care about gun laws
Clearly you left at the right time to be able to do all of those things
Is Brexit an issue for you or will you be able to stay without problems
I suspect the latter but I'm interested how that all actually works for someone in your position
>I left France 2
I was like " but there's plenty of other tv channels".
Knitting a brown sweater shall always remain one of my favourites
Not about shitting but it is remarkable how Norse and Dutch are sometimes alike
I mean the first one I understood without translation
After a night of heavy beers some people feel the need to pour some 'speculaas van 't vat'.
Speculoos on tap
"Mouler un cake", Mold a cake
"Aller au throne", Going on the throne"
I don't really know any more
Yeah
Heard that one and others, but I like the brown sweater thing the most as it doesn't sound so vulgar I guess
Maybe both exist, like chocolatine and Pain au Chocolat
My grandpa was a lada garagist in Belgium, it was and still is his favorite brand , mostly the old nivas are the ones he liked
We have a lot of jokes about them that I won't tell because they're actually fairly stupid
AFAIK they were not that popular but you could see them once in a while
Especially the Niva (4x4) as it was cheap and quite good for the job it had to do
One of my friends still has one and I think it's the most basic car I've ever seen but you just can't kill it as you can fix it with some ducttape and thread if needed to
Spanish friend of mine, living here in Belgium, proposed to go out for dinner
I asked what time
"9:30 P.M?"
"**No
**"
> Also when I took some friends to lisbon for a week, they were 3,one  British one American and one from Canada, I told them we were going  clubbing, they thought we were going home attl 2am, I felt sorry for  them when we left at 7
That's a American vs European thing mostly, I also knew a Canadian who could not fathom nightlife in belgium and how it went on until the morning hours, and especially techno clubs and the music he could not wrap his head around lol
Sounds like a piece of dystopian fiction, or even satire:

So I've travelled a bit and there are few time some cab drivers abroad got offended when I wanted to put on my seatbelt
They pleaded they were "good" drivers so there was no need
Then continued onwards rushing lights and tailgating like there's no tomorrow
Looking at you Turkey
Why would you not wear a seat belt
I'm Belgian and I've never heard of this
In my experience either the host has all the food or the host asks to guests if they can bring specific things
I have never tipped in Germany before because I didn't know I am supposed to
I don't want to be rude, but Spanish can be loud as hell
Think there was a group of about 6 Spanish tourists in my main bar about a month ago
I don't mind a bit of noise, it's a bar after all, but this was so out of place
I was actually wondering if they even noticed it that they were the only noise besides the music
What utter bullshit
> “Northern European friends” (mostly Dutch and Germans)
It's amazing how to the mediterraneans, everything else is 'Northern Europe' :p
My North-Germanic brethren and the Finnish would like to have a word, signore :p.
No, but when he and I use English as a bridge, we use it in speech nonetheless
It's a European thing in general, going home at 2am after going out is something you do when you have to work the next day or you're 16 and your mom is picking you up
I just read this in cockney
I am Belgian and I've done this often
But bbq is the only situation where this is acceptable
Because they didn't order alcohol
That's literally dinnertime
I know, but taken out of context the phrase seems like a really cynical view of humanity :p
Oh, I have been to Spain, Portugal, Italy and Malta, but you guys are taking the lead, that's for sure
Certainly when you're in a group
Don't know what it is
I guess it's a personal preference as well as I just hate "loud" people
Certainly in public
I can't get my head around people that yell in the streets or are extremely loud in bars, restaurants etc
I'm so glad I have my headphones with me when I'm done working and I'm on the train
If you are, you're gonna love it
Most expats I met as a masters & PhD did
\> Many Millennials don't drink alcohol anymore
Source
This just seems like a reddit anti-alcohol centric opinion to me, ~~teens~~ 20's people definitely still drink tons in belgium
I think part of the reason Northern Europeans are considered more grumpy is because when they visit Sourthern European countries they are just hangry from having to wait 2 hours past dinnertime to eat
I think they meant it as in they don't necessarily feel the need to drink when going out rather than just not drinking at all
I'm 21 and I personnaly don't like drinking and back when I was 17-18 people used to try to pressure me into drinking regardless but now I get more people doing the same or ordering mocktails or just one drink for instance
It might have to do with age and maturity but I feel like they don't feel the need to get shitfaced all the time anymore (doesn't mean it never happens though)
Now if you're litteraly talking about teens (which are not millenials) yes they do drink tons of alcohol but I mean they're teens
True, I still stand by my point though, tons of people here in their 20's who drink, I feel like the idea that 'our generation drinks less' is just the bias of reddit users who are more likely to be surrounded by geekier / homey people

Honestly Putin has a good experience on fights and he seem kinda beefy, however idk how his old age is affecting his physical strenght
Does our king count as head of state, cause he was trained with the paracommandos, so maybe he's good in a fight
Does our king count as head of state, cause he was trained with the paracommandos, so maybe he's good in a fight
He's 67 fyi
If he was born in 47 he'd be 73
He's actually from October 52 so he's turning 68 this year
When pokemon Go was first released I joined a chat room with other people who played that game and one of them put a meme on there with a 'pokemon Go starterpack'. This was in 2016 and I wasn't as familiar with international culture as I am now
The meme contained a phone, a battery pack, something else and a handgun
I asked why someone would take a gun with them on the street, unaware that I would instantly trigger all Americans in that chatroom
To us in the Lowlands, anything that has a slope is a hill, and a mountain, well, we dont have any but a big hill is a mountain to us lol
I can already feel the difference between Belgium and France, can't imagine what the difference with Russia would be
When I was little, I was visiting far relatives in France
They wanted to go walking along the coast during the afternoon
I'm someone who gets car sick quite easily (even more when I was a child) so I asked  if it was far away
They said it was really close by, so I assumed they meant like 10 to 30min
Even 30min didn't seem super close to me, but I knew the French had slight different definitions
In the end it was probably around 2 hours to the coast which is NOT AT ALL closeby
There's also the whole 'poepen' thing which can make it funny if I'm watching some Dutch tv program
Well, I'm glad to learn, thanks to this comment and the reply of the Dutchie, that I at least learnt the proprer Belgian way of using voormiddag, namiddag, etc
during my Dutch learning lessons in secondary school
I didn't know this
Learned something new today, thanks
Misérable in French means : who lives in misery, that is, extreme poverty, hunger, lack of decent housing, of proper clothes, etc
That, and what the French person said
I never figured it out
wtf
I didn't even know this
It's very disturbing to hear a 4-5 year old child say something to his mom like "Ik ga even poepen
Yup, when living in China for a while I was really missing 'real' bread
Because everything there is like a brioche
&#x200B;
My teacher once told me he was in Harbin and people were really proud of their specialty bread because it was so different \[It was tougher and more savory than the normal bread in China, I assume it might be influenced by Russia as Harbin is so North in China and relatively close to Russia\]
But for my teacher who lived in Belgium it just seemed like regular normal bread
Yeah I looked that up this morning because of once again a case of irresponsible, lethal behavior by a cop and appearently of all countries in North-America, Europe and Asia only Palestine has a higher ratio of citizens killed by cops per total citizens than the US
'Voormiddag' isn't used *that* often
It also differs from person to person on which time it means
I would say voormiddag is from 10am - noon
Noon is untill 2pm and afternoon is untill 5 or 6 pm but other people may say something else
Actually for me I feel like 'voormiddag' is used all the time by me and the people around me
I would only very rarely use the word 'morgen' to refer to 11 am
How I used it approximately:
\*Morgen: Starts at 4-7am to around 9-10am
\[Depending on the situation, I would call 4-5am nacht, 6am is definitely 'morgen' for me\]
\*Voormiddag: Starting from 9-10am to noon (12h)
\*Middag: depending on the context either 12 o'clock or if it's clear that it's meant more as a period than a fixted time: 11:30am - 1pm (occasionally 2pm)
\*Namiddag: Starting from 1-2pm until 5-6 pm
\*Late namiddag: 5-6pm, depending on the situation it might also include 4pm
\*Avond: Starts around 6-7pm
"poepen" is exclusively anal sex
Land where you are free to pay your own debts after going to college or hospital
Having aspergers and just being rather a-social I'm happy living in Belgium
People leave you the fuck alone
Cashiers say 1 or 2 words, etc
So Belgium, Netherlands, anything more North, would have been the best possible fit for me and I got it
Can't imagine living in a more social place
Well we Belgians love our wide range of beer very much so it's not really a taboo to get drunk
Of course it all depends on the time and place
Getting drunk during the week while being alone is kinda frowned upon (and you probably have a problem) but during the weekend at a party in the right setting no one will make a big deal out of it
We don't care as long that they don't do anything stupid like trash other peoples property, or fighting or drive while you're drunk most is accepted and people will just laugh it away
You get laughed at if you dont get drunk every weekend
Here amongst people my age its kinda the standard thing to do
Never understood it
Same here, but the first fase starts at 15, not 18
Not in my family and circle of friends
Am I marginaal
:thinking:
Belgium: When I was little there used to be a veggie truck (but like the ones you see in markets, kinda like a stall) that came round a couple times a week, they had these bad, very loud speakers trough which the woman yelled the prices and promotions while the man drove the truck, so you knew they were coming and you could go outside
A bit like an icecream truck, but way bigger, and way more annoying (but very handy)
There was also someone who sold soup out of their car
If you wanted soup, you put your pot on the doorstep, they would pass and see, stop and ring so they could ask you witch soup you wanted
they had like a couple of big barrels of hot soup in their trunk) and you could pay them per scoop
I think these would be forbidden in Belgium
Firstly because public space has to respect our laws, you can't advertise on the public space for politics/religion, except during election times, and you can't really use the public space/infrastructure to proselytise
The only types of billboards you'll see will either be : ads/commerials, or public messages from the government (road safety, environment, ...)
Secondly, these would be seen as hate-speech, and thus against the law and punished by it
the closest to it I've seen was a banner on someone's house that's visible from the train
It was just white letters on blue canvas "Jezus leeft" (Jesus lives)
We have quite a few around Antwerp though, especially around the Singel
[Example]
The classic one one a tall pole like [these] are rare, usually it's on smaller poles or plastered against buildings or structures
Along the highway it is actually forbidden to advertise
That's why we only see road safety campaigns or road work stuff on there
Exactly this, I also tend to believe that the Christians population is a lot lower here and also a lot more moderate
(with the occasional jehovah's witness here and there)
Step holy spirit what are you doing
For me it's Catalan, more than any other Latin/Romance language
I would say Dutch and a little bit of German because I live in Belgium and we are a trilingual country
Otherwise Spanish
Imo Swedish kinda sounds like a toddler who is learning to talk but isn't quite there yet
Yeah, if you just know how to pronounce what's written, you can understand most things
Think info panels, restaurant menus, road signage and news papers
It does take some effort though, but it's definitely possible
In my experience, many German words sound like simple or misspelled versions of Dutch words or are bascially older variants of it
I agree
I remember one of my first classes of German we had a reading test
Almost everyone failed (even though we could answer in Dutch) because we didn't even understand what the text was about lmao
Many French-speakers will say Italian, but personally I find catalan easier, it's closer to French
Yeah but if you don't know those rules and they're speaking casually (as in fast), it's nearly impossible to understand
Beer
The best strong beers in the world are made in Belgium
Complaining about taxes
Even tv stations that don't get tax money people are complaining"wow did they made such a bad tv show with our tax money".
Yeah, my nephews are half Bulgarian and their name days are considered as important as their birthdays
My mom always found this odd as it's a tradition that pretty much disappeared over the past few decades here in Belgium
Belgium is still holding together due to Beer and football
I read that with Jimmy Carr's Birmingham accent, I feel sped
I mean, we do have the highest income tax rate in the industrialized world, so it's fair if you ask me
Fries from the "frietkot/frietuur"
The real Fries with mayonnaise
la [Mitraillette] (also called special or routier) i guess
Stoverij met frieten
Flemish stew with fries
A croque monsieur
You know somebody should really open up a frietkot with a drive thru
What about Wiener Schnitzel
Honestly, looking at the vitrine in my frietkot, choosing between al the snacks, and then going for the usual is part of the experience for me
Drive-thru would ruin the experience
Nope
Seen it plenty of times in Flanders, especially 'student cities' like Leuven
I see it a lot where I live but that's a 5 min drive from Wallonia
Oops I didn't see it was about *fast* food
Nope
I never see any Belgian flags, except when it's football
However, sadly I see more and more Flemish flags in my home city
In the Republic of Georgia, it's not weird
People are very proud of their nation there
In Belgium, it IS weird to showcase it, unless we're at a sports event
You get a flag with a big ass jupiler logo on a crate of beer during the football cups
That's about as far as it goes
The Flemish flag though is a different thing altogether, it's quite common in conservative circles and there's even a version with black claws (instead of red) that people tend to find offensive as it's associated by many with WW2 collaboration
Displaying a Belgian flag - World Cup and National holidays, other than that it’s not too common but can be displayed as a sign of unity in bad times
It’s not that weird to have a Belgian flag overall I think, it’s kinda whatever
Displaying or owning a Flemish flag - tends to have very bad connotations and kind of makes you seem like a nationalist unless it’s solely for the purpose of sports
Like our neighboring countries just hanging out a flag is weird
As in, I rarely ever see it
We have one that we hang out every 2 years for a few weeks
The weird thing is that here I imagine a Belgian flag is more a left wing thing while say, a Flemish flag(especially one with black instead of red claws) is more a right wing thing
I’m Belgian, and I’ve never even owned a Belgian flag
Displaying one would be kinda weird (except during the World Cup)
Yeah it's an important distinction compared to other replies here: displaying the national flag is not associated with conservatives
The Flemish flag I associate with right wing/secessionists
But the Belgian flag isn't popular in to be flown casually
Official buildings fly them, but that's about it
You're right about the Flemish flag, though most of the times it's not the real Flemish flag but rather the one provided by the ultra right political party
Dumbasses
I live in Brussels and I'm thinking of hanging out all the flags of identities that are represented in our household, but then I'd have to hang out 5 flags for just 2 people
Belgium, Flanders, Basque country, Pakistan and France
I do sometimes see a Belgian flag in Antwerp but it is indeed extremely rare comparatively
And many of these Belgian flag are handmade or have the logo of some beer brand (or newspaper) on them
> The second one with a red lion is the one to go with
The Province of Luxembourg has that exact same flag too, which is probably a tad confusing for people who wouldn't know the history of our countries
Are there Luxembougers wanting to "get back their lost territories" by the way ?
It's quite a shame because I really like the Flemish flag
I have 2 of them because I collect flags
>not the real Flemish flag
The flag you are talking about is the flag of the Flemish movement and is how the oldest flag is depicted in our sources
It isn't fake in any sense even if people try to link it to collaboration(which is obviously easy since many in the Flemish movement did collaborate)
But the flag itself is, much like the movement, not fascistic in nature
The "real" Flemish flag you are talking about is the one of the Belgian region of Flanders and is seen as equivalent by most
Those who don't want to use it see it as representative of excessive compromises in the past but few care that much since they view both as valid
Obviously VB as a separatist party opts for spreading the one which isn't an official flag within Belgium
Lol, those are some interesting identities for just 2 people
Yeah I have a Belgian flag where the yellow has the shape of a pint beer and the top is white instead of yellow
Thanks, didn't know that
Still, i'm convinced most of the people flying this flag don't know this either and just do it because it arrived in the little goody bag they got for signing up with VB and think it's edgy
Well, historically, for century this province was part of your duchy
I guess they didn't want to throw away that part of their history, it is litterally a chunk of what could have been part of your country added to our, just because of language
In a way, instead of being a "fuck you", it could be seen as respect for the past too : "yes, it's part of Belgium now, but historically, it's Luxembourg". This province has quite a distinct identity from the rest of Wallonia, based around the fact they are Ardennais before anything, they are really "proud" in that regard
Yeah, there is definitely going to be some overlap there
VB is being clever in that sense by giving their followers as many flags as possible
Means they can co-opt the Flemish movement
Well, thank you for these corrections and details :-)
My father-side grandparents are from Bertrix and the area, and my father spent a lot of time with his grandparents in Bertrix too (but grew up in Wavre), so, my little knowledge about said province come from that
But once I'll be able too, this is the province I want to visit the more : going back to Gouvy and Saint-Hubert, where I had my "classes vertes", and visiting Arlon and Bastogne are in my to-do list
[This picture of a stewardes after the suicidebomber attack in Brussels Airport on March 22 2016]
At the second place there is this shot after the [infamous assault  of the Bende van Nijvel on this Delhaize (November 9 1985)] along with every blurry picture of possible suspects
As the case hasn't been solved yet and it's doubtful that it will ever be solved
That's a very nice picture
Is the woman sitting next to him an ordinary woman
Our most famous pictures are probably from Ypres and the surrounding area in WW1
Or Saint-Paul's during the Blitz
It's iconic, but I think it held a much lesser impact on us
While understandable it is important to note that the Congo Free State wasn't under Belgian rule but under rule of the Belgian King (our government had no say in it, although they ha dmire say than the king when it comes to Belgium)
It's a big difference as we give power to the king but back then the king could be king of multiple countries, we only changed that after the Congo Free State
It is also important to note that the atrocities commited there were often done by corporations and private armies there, among which many weren't Belgian
Leopold II is at fault for never doing anything properly or significant against it, not because he activly supported it
(He made laws at the end of his rule (way too late) to counter it, but it didn't do much in practice
When Congo became an official Belgian colony thing started changing for the better (until ofcourse Belgium was under German rule and had no influence), but it was still a colony with us as the "superiors" which was still a majot wrong
But that could be said of every colony
Another important note is that even if we do consider Belgium and it's people responsible for the Congo Free State years instead of Leopold II, is that Belgium wasn't the only country doing atrocities in Africa at the time, just the one who got the media attention
(Boerwars with the genocide of the Boers in South Africa, Herero Wars and the Maji-Maji Rebellion from Germany with the Shark Island concentration camp etc
) You could argue that Congo was worse, as many more died there, and you would we definitely right
But on the other hand Congo didn't have actual deathcamps
That being said, even though a great majority of the Belgians at the time had got nothing to do with Congo Free State, it is stil a major black page in our history books
I would also like to say that by no means I'm trying to downplay or justify the atrocities in the Congo Free State, I'm only giving context about who is to blame and about other major crimes against humanity at the time
When I was a kid in the summer of 1993, I ran downstairs as usual on Sunday mornings to watch my favourite show "Samson en Gert". Unfortunately instead of my show we got news an extra news bulletin about the death of King Baudouin
I was not amused that my Sunday ritual was cancelled
I think what made me most scared was the images of Sabine and Laetitia being freed from Dutroux's basement
He had kidnapped, raped and murdered several girls before them and kept them in a dungeon behind a concrete door in his basement
I don't remember if it was the girls that were freed or the girls before them, but the police had already searched the house once and heard girls shouting
They didn't do anything then, only later were Sabine and Laetitia found alive
Also the investigating judge decided to let the guy go in another sexual delinquency case with minor girls
This case completely shook the core of Belgian politics
It also caused the disbandment of the Rijkswacht to form the unified Federal Police
I was too young to understand any of this, I was just shook on these girls in underwear being pulled from a fucking dungeon
I wasn't scared to go out at all but damn
Apparently, VT4 interrupted Pokémon for footage of 9/11
Oooh gertje koning boydewijn is brood zo
Dood samson , koning boudewijn is dood
It does not feel strange, but it’s very present being from Ieper with the whole Flanders fields thing
The endless stream of wartime stories my grandparents can tell are also a reminder that it wasn’t long ago
It makes me feel incredibly thankful to live now
> Mainly WWI and WWII
Do you have any idea how long we've been punching each other in the face before those two wars
It's not strange to me
But I'm just really grateful
My great grandfather fought in the war and it took until the age of 95 for him to start talking about it to us
And even then I know he avoided things
I never want anyone to have to go through that ever again
Also in terms of money the dutch also use 2 tons to indicate 200
000 this is very widely used
I have noticed
TIL steenwerp is an actual distance and not a figure of speech
In feudal Japan [yes, koku]
Ah yeah like that, sure
I mostly use the figure of speech in more relative terms
The distance between my home and the park is a stone's throw away to a local
Talking to someone from Russia about the distance between my town and Antwerp is also "a stone's throw" away even though it's like 40 km
So I use it more freely than just literally a short distance I guess
Idk how others (or you lovely folks up north) see it :)
I think I have that comic somewhere in the attic, I vaguely remeber that joke :D
Which Pantheon
The French or the Roman
it really is a wonderful place, very mysterious atmosphere inside if you ask me, and for some reason the triskelion on the wall really resonated with me, maybe just because it's weird to realise this ancient symbol has been on that wall for literally thousands of years
Why the fuck would you designate Auschwitz as a wonder
It's meant to be wonders in Europe
Used to believe belgian cuisine was boring, then I discovered how the Dutch eat and greatly appreciate our food
oh yeah
I love Norway and its towns, they are so beautiful
It's not that great sorry
It's maybe because it's so different from what i'm. used to here in Belgium
I was Røros last summer and found it to be really beautiful
Trondheim was also very beautiful and something completely different
I see, it's still not to bad
It looks like a normal village, which is fine :)
We got Panos in Belgium, which serves coffee and other drinks, sandwiches and some baked goods
I'd really like to see it grow outside of Belgium
Recently moved to Germany from Belgium
I really like Food Brothers (best burger I've ever had) & l'Osteria (giant thin crust pizzas for a really fair price)
I was in Kos Greece a long time ago and there was a pancake shack on the way to the beach and they made the most amazing crepes i have ever eaten, you could combine your own with the ingredients they had
I went there every day around noon
That guy diserves to have a chain world wide
I would die for proper fish and chips places here in Belgium
But every time I had some outside the UK I’ve regretted it
Absolutely the best
They are not that special and good and a bit on the expensive side,there are a lot better sandwich bars in Belgium
They got bought out by Burger King now
Altho it generally wasn't seen as a good chain, even lesser than McDonald's.
We have sandwich bars nearly on everycorner that aren't a chain, i just go to my local one a few streets from me
But for recommendations i don't know man, don't go to the ones in tourist places and you will be good
It’s basically individual local businesses
And yes there are a few really good ones
To pick the best one is however though
No, also keep in mind that a lot of people also use other e-mail providers for work related stuff
Specifically Outlook is used in a lot of work environments
No, in Belgian French we simply say "mail". In France I think they say "courriel".
Nope, not here
In fact, most people use other email providers, like outlook or the special email address of their job
No, we say gmail only when we want to be specific
There might be some boomers that are confused about it that say gmail though
Over here it's just "mail/e-mail".
I think hotmail/outlook are the biggest mail providers over here though, especially if you count them as one and the same
However a sizeable portion has a mailadress through their internet provider as well
Going by the 1500'ish costumers I have I don't see gmail that often here in Belgium
Actually I barely see it at all
I don't even think one has a majority position
My teachers say G-Mail but that's probably because we all got a g-mail adress from school
I was boring and used my actual name
I see, well, since you say "portable" instead of GSM and "texto" instead of SMS, it wouldn't have surprised me if you said courriel, since the only places where I see this word in on French medias
> It's the same thing for "texto" honestly
I haven't heard anyone use the word in years, everyone around me says SMS
Really
Where are you in France
Everytime I watch a French youtuber, a French movie or Tv show, they say texto
Belgium as an independent country (post-1830) :
France, the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and maybe Luxembourg
Belgium before its independence :
France, the Netherlands, Germany/HRE/Prussia, Spain and Austria
- France
- Netherlands
- Germany
- Austria
- Congo
Honorary mention to the UK for meddling as well
Well, I'll only talk modern countries and societies, because societies like the Roman Empire or Classical Greece are studied pretty much everywhere
The Netherlands (because of the lengthy history enjoyed together)
France, although a lot of attention is given to it in French classes rather than history classes
The USA, especially the post-WW2 years (we had to learn all the presidents since FDR and such)
The UK at some points during its history; especially during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian Age were given attention
Difficult one, could be either Spain (especially during the 16th-17th centuries), Germany (especially late 19th and early 20th century, to give perspective on both World Wars), Congo (as it was a former colony, isn't higher on the list because it only became part of our history around 1885, but should be) or  China (as it's a rising power)
Though to answer
Belgium was not really a nation until late, so we just learned the whole of European history in history class
France
the Netherlands
Germany/HRE
Austria
Spain
You should really add Congo to  the post-1830 list instead of Luxembourg
Luxembourg was just
around for most of the time but not more than that
Congo on the other hand
Belgium is older than modern Germany and Italy
I totally agree with you
Yes, but unlike those two, there is no group of states that can be considered the equivalent
They aren't completely banned here
I can still buy supply drops in Call of Duty (I think, I've never tried it) and Limited Event Packs in Rainbow Six Siege
But I can't buy FIFA Packs in FIFA 19
I think loot boxes were only banned from a few companies
They should get a gambling license
The problem is that it’s often young kids who buy those things, often not realizing that it costs actual money
My brother once spent €2000 on some games, not realizing he would have to actually pay real money for it
Kids can still get their hands on 16+ and 18+ games even without an adult
It's not like we banned lootboxes either, we simply require them to get a gambling license and implement an age check
Gaming companies simply have refused to do so which results in a de facto ban of lootboxes for everyone
Just because it's parents' responsibility to keep an eye on their children's spending habits, doesn't mean companies should be allowed to offer (and even promote/advertise) gambling services to children
Both parents can be more responsible and gaming companies can be told to adjust their software so that children don't have access to gambling mechanisms
They're not mutually exclusive
>Parents are the ones who are being negatively impacted by loot boxes
Imagine if beer companies and supermarkets started arguing that they shouldn't be disallowed from selling alcohol to kids under the age of 16
"It's the parents' responsibility that their kids don't drink until they end up in the gutter, not ours".
If the logic doesn't hold up for alcohol, why should it hold up for gambling
It's not like our gambling laws are new, they've been in place long before lootboxes were a thing
It just so happens that gaming companies tried to be slick and implemented a gambling mechanic without abiding by our gambling regulations
That's not how the world works
>in that sense it is easy to control whether or not they consume alcohol
Only if you as a parent check every single penny you ever give your child
Do you think it's healthy for teenagers to be under that much scrutiny of their parents
Personally, I think teenagers should have certain freedoms such as the freedom to spend their allowance as they see fit
Now, if I knew that my kid at age 10 would be free to buy as much alcohol as he wants with his weekly 5 euros then I'd be much more warry about giving him money to spend as he sees fit
So instead of a sensible measure (aka kids under the age of 16 shouldn't be drinking alcohol) and enforcing that as a country, you want us to turn the financial side of our children into a police state where every parent accounts for all the money their children have so that they don't buy alcohol
There's a reason why nobody likes libertarian policies because they ignore pragmatic sensible solutions in favor of utopian societies where magically everyone will behave as a responsible citizen/parent as opposed to realistic solutions
Kids can start earning money in Belgium at 16, but minimum wage (like, 5-8€/h)
Doesn't mean they should start out with debts
I think they don't know how gambling addictions work :')
Username checks out
I can't speak for all European parties but aren't most green parties already single-issue-parties already
The way I indentify myself is situational, i.e. when I'm in another part of Belgium I'll identify myself as being from this region/town
When I'm in another EU nation I'll identify as Belgian and when I'm in the US I'll feel more European
So yeah there are 'components' but they'll come out depending on where I am
'Samson en Gert' is a Belgian tv series for children which also has unlimited meme potential
We have a subreddit called r/Belgica and we turn the flag 1 degree everyday there is no government formed
For Belgium: writing in our national language, belgicaans, which is a mix of dutch, french and german
Let's not forget neurchi de félixibilisation du marché du travail (flexibility of the labour mark)
Some memes are good there but I just like the name so much
Ricardo sa pinto also, in a game they throw a cup of beer on his foot and he acted like it was made of concrete and was laying on the field just to spill time
Oh god did you ever see those psychedelic hardstyle crazy as fuck youtube remixes all glitched out
I know it sounds weird if you never saw it but I can't really describe it any other way
Also, how can you forget about Donal Muyle
'Wij makn uw keukn in België'
Also, r/BELGICA is a meme subreddit where we speak in our three official languages at once
Das ziet er comme ça aus
I'm just dropping [this] here
"Samson (talking dog) vs
Gert (the guy)", by Studio Massa, who I believe is Dutch actually
The guy stopped because it took too long and there was a temporary government formed for the pandemic
Funny
I have never really thought of us as being close haha
I suppose in Flanders we feel closer to the Netherlands because of the language
We share **a** language
The majority of our country speaks another one ;)
Most of us, if not all, would argue the Netherlands is our best bro
Considering how historically, Belgium and the Netherlands have for the most part been tied together, we share a lot of our history and are therefore similar countries with fond relations . Our Benelux alliance is older than the EU and still stands today
Even our militaries often operate directly together
In Belgium I would have said that our bros are more Luxembourg and Netherlands than France
Sorry
Ah lovely that you are finally admitting you like us ️
Culture-wise I would say Belgium (including Flanders) is often a lot closer to France or the Romance world than the Netherlands
This can be partially explained by the fact that we are Catholic instead of those hardcore protestants in the Netherlands
Even in this secular day and age the cultural divide with the Netherlands still feels a lot bigger than the one with France
Interesting view
As a Belgian, I considered the Netherlands more closely aligned to Germany with your brutal honesty, protestant sobriety, strong sense of organization and so on
What would you consider similar between Belgium and (some parts of) Germany
This feeling is, to my experience, most often not reciprocated by Flemings
Some are separatist but even among them, the notion of joining the Netherlands is a really marginal thought
I too, think those Dutchmen underestimate the cultural divide that exists between Belgium and the Netherlands
I feel like we're even polar opposites on quite a lot of issues, which makes me feel even more at home in France or, to a lesser extent Germany
These deep differences have been growing since at least the eight-year's war
You have some differences between Flemings and Walloons too but they do not come even near to the differences between us Flemings and you the Dutch imo
I don't know why so many Dutch like to say that
I think part of it is because they often don't know us so well as we know them as the much bigger entity
Another part, I feel, is sadly often because the Dutch feel culturally superior and imperialistic, and think they should make some kind of Anschluss of the 'lost provinces', thereby ignoring that Belgium has any culture of its own or appropriating our culture
I'm not accusing you of that to be clear (I actually agree with what everything you said), I'm just saying that those Dutchmen exist and are omnipresent on the internet whenever Belgium is mentioned
Something by which I can get pretty annoyed to be frank
Also, pro tip: if you happen to drop by in Belgium, always welcome but do not call us Dutch (or French for that matter), it will likely come over as rude
For the rest, I do like you Dutchies and I am certainly up for a close Benelux cooperation, just acknowledging that we are not quite the same (even in the countries themselves there's a lot of diversity which you also already alluded at with your post), and that all regions have their own merit (not that the Netherlands or the Holland region is superior to everything else)
Kind greetings from your Southern neighbour
EDIT: mainly my bad English
I second this, you explained it perfectly
I agree with that
Basically :
-Portugese people can understand Spanish fairly easily, it's not that easy the other way around though
-Italians can understand Spanish and I guess it would be pretty much the same for Spanish speakers to understand Italian
-Excluding Romanian, French is probably the hardest to understand from speakers of other romance languages
And Romanian can pretty much be summed up like this :
-Other romance languages : Hey Romanian
Are you one of us
-Romanian : *da*
Asteûr le wèlon de Tcharlerwè, y'a pu pon de djint pou l'parlêr !
Some counties in Belgium (mostly rural ones) have the tradition of shooting carbide guns
It's a sort of metal rack (pipes) where you poor in some chemical stuff and you hit it with a heavy hammer
It make a very VERY loud bang
Can go on for the entire night in some cases
Luckily injuries are pretty rare
I'm really late but here goes
In Belgium we play [Les lacs du Connemara and wave/dance with our napkins
Well the actual Belgian flag has horizontal lines and is particularly similar to the German one
Interesting fact is that in the constitution the flag remains horizontal and that has never been changed since the revolution
So if we follow our constitution, we've been using the wrong flag now for around 180 years
How Belgian is that
As far as I know the constitution didn't mention the direction of the stripes or the order of the colors
They do say red, yellow, black but don't specify that that is a fixed order, so us being Belgians of course we'll go the exact opposite way
> Article 193:
>De Belgische Natie kiest als kleuren rood, geel en zwart, en als rijkswapen de Belgische Leeuw met de kenspreuk EENDRACHT MAAKT MACHT
>La Nation belge adopte les couleurs rouge, jaune et noire, et pour armes du Royaume le Lion Belgique avec la légende : L'UNION FAIT LA FORCE
>Die Belgische Nation wählt die Farben Rot, Gelb und Schwarz und als Wappen des Königreichs den Belgischen Löwen mit dem Spruch: EINIGKEIT MACHT STARK
I know that the first Belgian flags had horizontal lines, but unless it's mentioned somewhere else in the constitution I don't think they have to be horizontal
Btw: Happy cake day
Red Lion with the white and blue stripe ? [The best one]
I actually prefer that one because Arlon/Arel has the same one/similar
Why put an Albanian eagle
Why not have you own identity as Kosovans
Only country in the world to do that  so proud
Scotland technically still is
As soon as I started working I started paying a contribution to the household budget yeah
At that point your parents no longer get money from the government for supporting you and it's only fair that you pay something for having a place to live and food
Definitely not unheard of
I didn't have to, but a lot of my peers did have to pay a kind of rent after getting a job and still living at home
Usually more a token tribute, but a friend of mine has to fork over 50% of his pay
His parents like the cashcow, and are making it difficult for him to move out/guilting him into staying (and paying)
Yes it is, I have no problem with it because renting is still more expensive than living at home where I am paying 200 euro a month, as a contribution to household costs
Not common at all and seriously weird
Personally my parents were like "just safe all the money you make with your job and buy yourself a place
I left home when I had saved up 100k basically and instead of those 30-40 years types of thing I'll have my apartment paid off in 10
Not something everyone can do obviously but it's not like I wouldn't have chipped in if they had financial trouble
My entire family is basically based on helping each other out
I helped them a lot just not in financial ways
Literally my sister
My parents were very generous and did not want me to contribute financially
My sister is lazy as fuck, basically taking advantage of that and the free meals
She's had a job for almost five years now without lifting a finger around the house
Like, good for her that she can save a fuckton of money, but I don't like her straining my already older and tired parents
Same in Belgium
For a couple of years now, there have been sightings of a wolf couple in our country and even talks of them having cubs, but hunters and farmers (and simpletons) are afraid of them and don’t want them
Which is sad and pathetic
And then you have Flemish Dutch which shares the same grammar and vocabulary but everything means something else
And 'Dutch sounds like drunken German' is also a common one
> we have guttural and nasal sounds which can be off-putting for some
Especially in France, that's how we can spot you in Belgium : because of how nasal and higher-pitched many French people speak
Someone once told me Dutch is just German for dummies
[Maybe it's the other way around
Love your username btw
Belgian Dutch is the one without coughing up sandpaper
i like this metaphor for the gooische r
Thanks Italy for the food
Thank you France for giving us a decent law system, and for being the cultural giant that you are
France will always have a special place in my heart because of their help during our independence struggle
Thanks French bros
Except our roads, they are terrible
I don't like putting them on top of a hot cup, they always get mushy because of the steam
But thanks for the coaster tip that seems like a fix to my issue
When I'm at home never
When I'm gone for just a second I also leave it unlocked
But then again I've got a dog walking around
I barely bother at night honestly but that's mostly because money is of little importance to me
IF I get robbed because I left the back door open it doesn't really matter to me
During the day, especially in summer, there is a good change you can just walk through the backdoor
Edit: Going by what Americans(and Austrians for some reason) said I'll repeat what most Europeans know
Front door is locked by default without a key(or as we use, a code, no need to mess with keys for me, haha)
And actually LOCKing the front door just doesn't happen
Maybe if we go on holiday, if we think about it
Hotel doors seem to be the best example here yea

Meejd
The death of Slovakian in a police cell several years ago
Apparently all was caught on camera and the images only just leaked a few months ago
On the images you can see a female officer imitating Hitler
After going over these news items, we Redditors thought were popular subjects in our own countries, I wonder where I could have learned about all this using another Internet entry point
Can we make this a recurring item ? Reading all this is a learning experience that I think is essential for a person to be able to form an opinion about his environment
Because last time you won the WC the country was so calm
I think those police agents still work for the police witch is also pretty terrible
It's under full investigation
Media had gone silent for a bit because of lack of new info, but it is being looked into
Covid is still the number 1 topic though
Election season in the US is high on the list too
The media was quit about it for a while but the women who did the nazi salute just came out whit her side of the story so its back in the news
Internationally it's KU Leuven, but as long as you stay inside Belgium, your employer most likely won't care
I think the universities here are very homogenous and teach about the same stuff
but for the so called "Top" I will have to go with the University of Ghent and the Catholic University of Leuven
In Belgium, it mostly depends on what you’re studying, each have their own specialities, but for example for medicine, the big-ones all have their own specialisations
But in general, both Antwerp and Hasselt University are probably less prestigious
When it comes to that, it’s down to the KUL/UGent/VUB/ULB
People who went to KUL tend to care
In the international rankings, Ugent is on top with KU Leuven shortly behind
The others aren't even in the ranking
I've studied both at the UGent and UAntwerpen
Maybe UGent is more prestigious but I found the quality of teaching much better at UAntwerpen
I also have a friend who went to get an extra degree (in bio-informatics) at the KUL
He found the level of his professors at the UAntwerpen to be much better than at the KUL
UHasselt is mostly low in prestige due to it catering more towards a different teaching/learning style and a huge lack of masters degrees and phd's
Does anyone maybe know what uni is best for languages
They're usually all in the ranking, just not the top 100
Sometimes KUL tops as well
Age of the university is a factor in those rankings, and makes it harder for young universities to get as ‘high’ as the older universities in Belgium
That’s why there are separate rankings for younger universities (e.g. QS 50 under 50, with multiple Belgian universities)
Prestige is mostly determined by achievements of your alumni
UA is relatively young university so their alumni haven't been able to do too much
I think it's mostly due to it being very young, they still need to find their niche market
I think this might depend on the languages themselves
If you want to study Sinology (Chinese) in Flanders, I'd recommend KU Leuven over UGent
I went to UGent but I heard in KU Leuven you get more of a choice if you want to focus more on thr language or more on the cultural aspects
While studying in UGent I met a few students who did Sinology at KU Leuven and I felt like their Chinese language level was generally better
For other languages I have no idea
Might be an unpopular opinion but I'd say the UK is one of the least interesting ones
It could be because it's so present in pop culture and basically anywhere in the world you go you'll find the UK (food, music, movies, language, people) that there's nothing new to see there
Luxembourg is like what Belgium would be if it had competent leaders
Clean streets, beautiful nature, good economy, ...
Well I don't know what your specific interests are but I always thought we had a little bit of everything on offer
In terms of gastronomy the Belgian cuisine is often described as a mix between French quality and German quantity while still maintaining its own character ofcourse
I'd also say we're a pretty interesting country for the beer lover
History-wise the regions of Flanders and Brabant were extremely rich regions through trade during the Middle Ages and frontrunner of the Northern renaissance
This lasted until the Fall of Antwerp in 1585 after which the centre of artistic and scientific innovation moved north to the Netherlands
Later on Belgium was the first country on the continent to engage in the Industrial Revolution rendering us a big economic power once again and creating and attracting lots of influential figures (f.e. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote their Communist Manifesto in Café le Cygne on Brussels' Grand Place) until the Germans dismanteled our entire industry in the first World War and moved it to Germany
In terms of nature we don't have anything extravagant like the Alps or the Mediterranean but the Ardennes are pretty neat I guess
Very nice place for a hike, rock climbing, canoeing, cave exploration et cetera
So like I said, nothing crazy, but quite a rich history, good food, and some nice nature
The weather is pretty shit I guess
If you're into beer, there's the smorgasbord of beer types, brands and flavors, I think unchallenged by any other country (and I'm not talking craft beers, but mainstream ones)
There is also the mix of French/Dutch/German cultures and languages
You'll also find many things (that people don't think much about but still) that were invented here, some with their own small town/village, like duffel bags, spas, the saxophone, house music, and fries

There is more to Belgium than beer, fries and chocolate
Manneken pis isn't the best thing at all
I don't even know why that thing is a tourist hotspot
Besides the feeling of seeing everything that's in the UK anywhere in the world you go, or even home
Iceland is the best place to see/study/visit the legacy of Old Norse/Norsemen (misnamed "Viking" in mainstream medias) culture though
Thanks to their isolation, it was more preserved there
Who hates you
Belgians
I assure we do not
We only hate The Dutch, French, Germans, Americans and Brits
Also the Dutch
This tbh
We are kinda not as popular are our german, dutch and french neighbours but we do have a lot to offer other than the small statue
Other than amazing beers and fries, we have beautiful cities like Gent or Dinant
Amazing party life, if youre into it, because i know most of us are
I don't know why everyone thinks our accent is adorable
It's just better than Dutch accent is all I know
In fact it gets worse
Flanders is both a region and a community but its territory depends on the relevant policy
Well, in that case I correct myself and not say UK but England
Haha, I can totally understand
Hou uw bek, schijtfransoos
Too bad I moved here with two kids
I missed the whole nightlife scene
Where is it best
That's why I said "if".
Yeah but again, those hundreds or thousands of beer styles are mostly craft beers or independent breweries whose beer you can't find easily, or are overpriced
In the typical US bar you'll find Bud and the same watered-down beers
Thats because you're so neatly packed together, just like the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourgh are
Well im still 22 and a student so most my fun times are in Gent & Brussels near uni
Surely lots of bars and club everywhere that are so much fun
What
Did you say something about Belgium's backyard
^i ^think ^so, ^this ^is ^how ^you ^are ^supposed ^to ^be ^patriotic
Okay now you crossed a line pal
We were just joking around, why would you say something so hurtful
You'd better, it's the only reason Belgians have guns anymore
Lol no but seriously I wouldnt know why he would get triggered other than for shits and giggles
We laugh at that expression (because we know we can make them better than the French ;) )
Same, but thats because i see fries and waffles as standard
"*This is the shit
*" or "*X is the shit
In English, it means something is great, in French, shit (*merde*) is always associated with something negative
Culturally, I don't understand how/why it means something positive in English, since feces are the most disgusting thing in the world
Saying "*Ça c'est la merde !*" or "*X est la merde !*" would means something is bad
In Dutch exactly the same
Same but depending on the tone you pronounce 'please' with
However, *Merde !* (*shit*), or *Bonne merde !* (*good shit*), are positive expression in french
'Frikadelbroodje' wtf even is that lol
I'm guessing it's what we call a 'worstenbroodje'. And I don't even know what 'een tikkie' is
Where in Belgium
Never heard any francophone use *merde* that way
In Liège, it's to wish good luck to someone
I've heard countless time *Bonne merde !* before taking a school exam
Edit: [Here is some references; Interjection 2 & 3]
I knew it
(North) Brabant is officially the best part of the Netherlands
But what does 'een tikkie' mean
Oh, yes, but the logic behind this is : you say *merde* instead of *chance* because : superstition says that the opposite of what you wish will happen
So, saying *chance*  would bring *malheur*, so you wish something bad instead
It's like PayConiq/Bancontact in Belgium
In the French part of Belgium, we have a socialist party called the PS
They have been in office for years, except for the last 5 and there where a lot of skeletons that came out of the closet
For example, they bought tanks in 200* that had a barrel that didn’t comply with the EU standard
Only one factory in Belgium made ammo for that, FN Herstal
Which is property of the French speaking government in Belgium (where the PS still reigns) and the minister of defence of that time, was a socialist (PS) who’s hometown was the town where FN Herstal was located
They still sell a lot of guns to Saoudi Arabia, which sells them to muslims extremist parties
Oh and the tanks from 200* still haven’t fired a single round because they still haven’t been able to get the ammo to comply properly
PSA: you can check the "official" perceived corruptness of your country on this website:
EDIT: A word
Our biggest problem is not having a goverment that is devoted to keeping the country together
Frankly we don't have a goverment at all, what is probably for the best
In Belgium much of the corruption is hidden
It shows up if you have an activity and want to build, licenses, produce, permits
I don’t doubt that there is corruption in our country actually I won’t be surprised that it’s in every country
Everywhere there is money there are scumbags who want more
We had a lot of cases of abuse of resources,tax money and private meetings with project developers
There are a few bad apples that’s true
But I don’t think out institutions or system is corrupt as a whole
I absolutely despise the PS but it's pretty naive to think they're the only ones in the corruption boat
A good example is Alain Mathot
One of the most corrupted men of the PS and who did save his arse by voting against the lifting of his parliamentary immunity
The NVA
No surprise, we're doing worse than our neighbours except France
Most of switzerland uses German though
Unless you visit French speaking region of switzerland, that french won't be useful
Oh, I did not know about that bit of story !
Very interesting, I actually go fairly often in Switzerland in the french speaking part in the Vaud, 1hour away from Lausanne :)
r/AskEurope now has 40000 subscribers
Fuck you for putting Pachelbel on there (I’m a cellist )
Living in the capital:
Endless roadworks, the air smells bad, people tend to ignore the other people, everything's close so it's super pratical, very nice public transportation system, a lot of car traffic, a lot of green parks and a huge one that's nearby a whole forest (Bois de la cambre and the forest De Soigne) so nature is very accessible which is nice to take a break from the city, very nice architecture in the middle of ugly ones, a lot of cultural things to do,great restaurants scene even though it's still lacking of more specific asian cuisine other than just sushi,thai and basic chinese
I live in Brussels and I'm very happy about it
Public transport is great in non-COVID times
And anything I could ever need is accessable
I've been to many European capitals and I love most of them, but nothing compares to Brussels in terms of night life and bars
We have so many awesome old and authentic bars which serve such variety in Belgian beers, it's heavenly
A great workday is one where I get up, walk my daughter to school and then walk to work (picking up an espresso on the way at my local bakery)
I do my work, which I enjoy, and meet up with friends at a bar (it works when my wife picks up my daughter from school)
A good evening is where I get home late, obviously not every day
In the weekend I spend time with my family playing boardgames, reading books, taking walks and relaxing in the park
A high speed train network across all of Europe with super modern trains that all have a similar theme
A network of high quality, railway like bicycle infrastructure for long-distance cycling
Something like the Ravel-network in Wallonia, these are great because they use disused tram- and railway tracks which means light slopes, connecting towns and villages, many bridges and tunnels and practical widths
We could alternatively also place them next to existing railways, rivers, and channels
We should prioritise cyclists at all minor road-crossings and assign each long route a clear name/code
It would just be the best, easiest to ride cycle network, on which you would almost never need to stop if you aren't in a major city
In the future,  with cheaper electric bikes and the knowledge that every faraway place has a nice and easy to follow path to take you there
This would be pretty attractive to a wider audience than we may now imagine
Maybe
Just maybe, un-do an infrastructure ?
I mean
Get rid of the tunnel across the Channel ?
They want to be by themselves anyway
Let them
An affordable high speed train network would be nice
Right now, if you have a car, a partner and a few kids, it is often "cheaper" to take the car
I don't know how feasable this is, but a bridge between Helsinki and Tallinn would be way better geopolitically
It would allow the EU to block off Saint Petersburg from the rest of the Baltic sea, and making supplying Kallinningrad impossible for the Russians in case of war
We have begun creating [national "bicycle" highways (fietsostrades/fietssnelwegen)] connecting major cities
Not all are finished, but the idea is that one might cycle between cities with minimal roadcrossings
Love for this to expand internationally as well
Vlad P, who lives in Moskou, would see his main access to the oceans blocked by dams
He's never going to accept his
Yeah travelling by train is so much easier and more comfortable than travelling by car or plane
I feel like a lot more people would travel to places further away that they otherwise wouldn't travel to
That's exactly what I had in mind
Or something like [this] but it would be weird to see a train with the Estonian flag in Spain for example
All the same with the flag of the EU or all have the national flag of a country
Check out Antwerp station
It's a beautiful 19th century station, but it's been upgraded to service high speed trains and has had a huge capacity increase, all with respect to the old building
You could make the bridge go up so the shipping routes can stay open
It's just a lot easier to block of a few gates under the bridge than a whole sea
But I agree that naval batteries would probably be a much cheaper solution
Well that just sounds amazing
We better get these quick
Yeah that really sucks
Maybe a railway from Tallinn to Helsinki could work
Yeah you're right
And not just national flags, also regional ones
Imagine a train with the Welsh dragon
I mean, airplanes are basically subsidized do maybe someone should just do that to trains instead and see how far that gets us before looking at the rest of the costs
Yes, and they even built a big bridge over the Strait of Kertch, which is admitedly a lot shorter, but by doing so have made the Ukranian city of Mariupol a lot more reliant on that bridge not being blocked
Maaaaaybe they want to cooperate with the EU
Many people here rather wish Charleroi didn't exist
In my city in Belgium we have a saying that translates to "Antwerp is the city, the rest is parking"
Albert, Leopold, Philip, Baudoin
Sucks to be a new country
We'd have: Leopold, Leopold, Albert, Leopold, Boudewijn, Albert and Filip
For the Queens we have: Paola, Fabiola, Mathilde and a few other that I don't know and i'm too lazy to search
Leo would be a safe choice
Bo would be possible too
Not a great choice
3 times Leopold, which would likely be a faux-pas considering the second's actions in Congo
2 times Alhert, one Filip and one Boudewijn
You're shit out of luck if you're a girl, but if Filip abdicates soon, girls could be named Elisabeth
Well, if we can also use predecessor states maybe we have more people
The burgundian dukes for example; Karel, Jan, names like that
And if you wait long enough, you can name your daughter Elisabeth
My name is actually Elisabeth, so that would be fun
yeah but was burgundy belgium ?
you can't argue for it, but you can argue against it
>I've seen people have a "my life is a lie" type of reaction when they first found out
This was me when I found out that Joey is actually learning French with Phoebe and not Spanish
When I was presented with the choice of learning Spanish or German, I thought to myself: which would give me the best traveling experiences
The answer is dos cervezas por favor and me speaking in Rammstein lyrics to Germans
Actually it's "Zwieber".
Yeah, but the guy you responded to apparantly can't form one Dutch sentence without letting slip in some English
"How" should be "hoe". Probably autocorrect if I have to guess, because "How" is for some reason capitalised as well
Also the sentence structure isn't grammatically correct
/Grammar n*zi out
In Belgium we dont even need an opinion to divide the population lol
Among French speakers, the gender of “COVID”.
It was “le covid“ (masculine form) for the longest, then by the end of last year, a “la” agenda arrived out of nowhere
Now every now and then, you’ll hear someone (mainly journalists) say “la covid” (feminine form), sowing confusion and sparking debates among those who raised their eyebrows upon hearing it
Well but that's clearly because of the socialists/walloons/Flemish nationalists/antwerpians/people who shop at aldi/bmw drivers/vegans/recreational cyclists/virologists/MeToo movement/unions/company cars/muslims/priests/covid restrictions/education system/government/road network/landlords
sauce on the fries or in a little plastic jar
And in Belgium it's frieten
Just frieten or fritten
Learn to use plural , cheaseheads
I've never seen Schlagobers when I was in Austria, menus always call it Sahne
Granted, I went almost exclusively for skiing holidays, so maybe they use Sahne for tourists
That's some fucked up shit ngl
A patat is a potato and nothing else
It would be like calling a sword iron
A tractor is used by farmers, teenage guys are trekkers
wow didn't even realise haha, thanks
I'd say it's more between jupiler and stella artois (where I live)
But it's not on the same level, a jupiler person wouldn't say stella is crap
Those damn Belgians
They ruined Belgium
if you say it with a nasty Antwerp accent the 'frietje' problem will go away, though your fellow Dutchies probably won't understand you
1 friet 3 frieten da is gwn logica
En kwni wa er mis is me onze mayo
ah didn't know, I'm from the Antwerp region
I like jupiler more, but stella seems to be the most popular here (atleast in my social circle)
Nobody takes us seriously, we're that unthreatening neighbour
If you want any kind of career you have to go to Brussels
In the south we rely on the French to provide our entertainment (we watch all French TV shows, movies, etc
) and (albeit it's a shameful secret of ours) pretty much identify as French
There are very little things someone could point out as being constitutive of "belgian culture" (waffles, beer, fries, ridiculously complex politics
Truly Belgium feels even smaller because we're also split in two with the language border
Wallonia (the southern, French speaking part of Belgium) has less than 4 million people
Going to Flanders (the northern part) kind of feels like going abroad
There are maybe 2-3 cities, the rest are honestly just towns
It's a little boring
Watching other countries' national tv channels on the regular
I can't imagine a French person watching belgian national tv
Many people in Belgium don't even know what you luxembourgers are up to
You're actually right on many points :)
This is all very subjective of course
Hope no one takes offense in my strong opinions :p
It's a very unpopular opinion of mine so do not be surprised if a lot of walloons swear the opposite :p
Don't get me started on that with Belgium
Yes, Belgium is the capital of Brugge
1) Luxembourg borders the least densely populated part of our country, which limits cross-border interaction with most of Belgium's population
2) Luxembourg is a small, stable and rich democracy
Basically everything the media thinks is uninteresting
3) Luxembourg media is completely absent, at least in Flanders
I can't immediately think of a single television show, film or song that I would link to Luxembourg
I just watched a trailer on youtube of Superjhemp retörns and I think the humour is very relatable
A leopard is called a "luipaard" in dutch
Translated to english it literally says "Lazy Horse"
I'm Belgian so I speak Dutch:
Nijlpaard (nile horse) - Hippo
Roofvogel (robbery bird) - Bird of prey
Jachtluipaard (hunting leopard) - Cheetah
Luipaard (lazy horse) - Leopard
Neushoorn (nose horn) - Rhino
Kakkerlak (pooper-varnish) - Cockroach
Ijsbeer (ice bear) - Polar Bear
Veelvraat (eat-a-lot) - Wolverine
Das (tie) - Badger
Doodskopaapje (death head monkey / "skull monkey) - Squirrel monkey
Schoenbekooievaar (shoe-beak-stork) - Shoebill
Zeekoe (sea cow) - Manatee
Walvis (shore fish) - Whale
Potvis (jar fish) - Sperm Whale
There a lot more tho
As usual, 90% of this list also applies to Dutch
The original words are different, but when literally translated they end up the same
> "orsetto lavatore" which lterally means "little washer bear".
We call him raton laveur (little washing rat) in French
in dutch it's Nile Horse, pretty close
For Belgium, I would say Dos Cervesas from Tom Waes
That one was very popular a few years back
Zoutelande by BLØF, was popular at the same time as well I think
I think you know this song
>level 1thewinberg SwedenScore hidden · 2 hours agoThe year was 2004
The world had been conquered by a crazy blue frog
You could say Avicii
Lais: 't smidje
But internationally famous
Call me old but I would say  [Technotronic - pump up the jam] or [2 unlimited - no limit]
[Danzel with Pump it up]  is/was also really popular .
yup, this one
Even more than blue
And "anton aus tirol"
Yes, as a folk party song that one absolutely takes the cake, but as an equivalent to Despacito I think Dos Cervesas is more fitting
Poland is obsessed with this song
Don't remind me of that nightmare
The description OP gave didn't imply it had to be a *bad* song
And tbf it's all subjective
Not the first austrian you say such things about
#Not functioning or not finished
##Buildings
- In 1975, the city of Leuven gained permission to build a new hospital wing with 622 new beds
The building structure was finished in 1983, but the inner building was never finished, except for the lower floor, due to a change in hospital policies from the government
Since it cannot be used for other means, it will be demolished again
##Railways
- 2
3 km of the premetro tunnel structures of Antwerp are built between 1977 and 1986, but was never used
In 2006, the government used 100 meters of those tunnels for the new tram line 5
- There is a ghost station at Metro line 2 in Brussels, named Sainctelle, never used due how close to the two neighboring stations were
- There is ra 2
5 km long metro tunnel at Liège underneath the Quai Saint-Léonard for a never-built metro line
##Road works
- A tunnel at Antwerp under the Fr
Roosevelt place and the Tenier place
It will never be in use due to the long slope necessary for driving out of such a deep tunnel; being too long to fit in the current traffic plan
In 2019, part of it was repurposed as an underground car parking near a premetro station
- At Harelbeke, the ring road around the city of Kortrijk was never finished due to money problems
Because of that, there is a dead end 2 by 2 lane bridge over the river Lys
- [A bridge for a 2 by 2 lane road at Strépy-Bracquegnies] The four lane road would circle around the north of the centre of Thieu
##Water works
- The channel Ieper-Komen
The purpose was to connect the Yser river at Ypres with the Leie at Lys river
A channel bridge was necessary at Hollebeke
The works started at 1864, but couldn't be finished, even after multiple tries, due to the weak earth in the area
Now, the channel only runs up to Yper itself
- The channel Ourthe
The purpose was to connect the Meuse river at Liège with the Lys
The construction started at 1827 under command of Dutch king Willem I. With Belgium becoming independent at 1830, the political climate changed
At that time, people were constructing the part of the channel with the tunnel at Bernistap, which should be about 2
5 km long, but work on the tunnel ceased
It's only built for 1
1 km and that's where the channel stops
#Functions, but questioning if it's proven useful
- Premetro at Charleroi: There were 8 arms planned, and from those, 3 were built and used
A fourth is almost built, but is only used for the education of tram drivers
- The [cable-stayed bridge near Hasselt] over the Albert channel, as part of a never used connection between the cities of Hasselt and Genk
Originally planned as a two by two road, now used as a residential road
*(Note: I live near there
In the original plan, it would cut through a nature reserve, now it makes a sharp bend at the south of the channel instead, as seen here:
>Also in the bigger picture of connecting the provincial capital of Hasselt and the nearby highway with its northern surroundings, the big 2 by 2 highway-like road in the north of the province bottlenecks to a 2 lane road in the busiest part; a change has been part of a debate for the last 30 years, and we're still no further than just some possible plans
Part of it runs through a city centre whose merchants aren't all too happy with losing potential customers if a ring road or a tunnel would be built, and part of the road runs bordering
a nature reserve
- A double viaduct near Sint-Truiden has ever been proposed for a highway expansion between the city of Tienen and the Dutch city of Maastricht
One viaduct and 1
5 km of highway road has been built
The actual highway itself never came, but the 1
5 km highway road between the two bridges can still be used to travel between a major road and a residential road
#Didn't function, but has a new useful destination
- The A1 highway between Brussels and Antwerp has a 40 meter wide space in the middle of the road for a future built super highway with only one off-ramp between Brussels and Antwerp
The super highway never came, and the space has been reclaimed to build a forest in recognition for all who died in road accidents, and a fast railway connection
- The lubrication pipe next to the Albert channel costed 125 million euro, and was meant to transport dirty water from the chemical industry at Tessenderlo to the Scheldt river
Because of construction mistakes, it never functioned that way, and in the '90s it was rebuilt for the transport of drinking water
#Didn't function, and has eventually been broken down
- Euroshopping Mechelen: A shopping centre in the city centre with a parking tower, shops, a city banquet hall, and restaurants
Built in the '60s, never functioned
Shops were always empty, the parking tower was in a bad state, and the city banquet hall was only sporadically used
The building has been destroyed and instead, a residential area has been built
Source and more, but I'm not going to type over and translate the entire Wikipedia article:  (Though feel free to click the link for some pretty pictures
The [Oosterweelverbinding] a project that's been "in the making" for over 20 years now
It should complete the ring around Antwerp, with construction finally started in 2019, they plan to finish everything in 2026
The new national football stadium
It was supposed to be built for the Euro 2020
If I remember correctly, Anderlecht was supposed to rent it if it wasn't used by out national football team
But they pulled out of the agreement
Then there were problems with *where* it could be build
They didn't get a permit from the givernment to build it at the wanted location
Result: we're not one of the hosting countries anymore of Euro 2020 and I don't think it's ever going to be build
Also the renovation of the Justice Palace
It started in 2003, and it has taken so long that even the scaffolding that are used for the renovation need reparations
Over de tuikabelbrug en waarom er zoveel andere overbodige projecten waren:
Vroeger, rond '60 werden verkeersdeskundigen, of ingenieurs indertijd, betaald in vormen van betonpremies
Hoe meer beton er lag, hoe meer ze betaald werden
Een van de tactieken dat ze gebruikten om de regering te overtuigen meer wegen te bouwen was om eerst zogenaamde kunstwerken neer te planten, dit zijn bruggen, tunnels, knooppunten, enz
om daarna te vragen aan de regering: "De bruggen en tunnels liggen er al
Het zou dom zijn om daar geen wegen op aan te sluiten
Een tactiek die nu (na jaren '90) niet meer mogelijk is; en met dank: de betonpremie werd eindelijk afgeschaft en de regering wilt nu eerst alles plannen en daarna pas beginnen met bouwen
Aan de andere kant: alles plannen betekent dat vertragingen heel lang kunnen uitlopen
Bron: verteld door docent verkeerskunde aan de hogeschool waar ik student was
It's too the same case in Wallonia with rail stations of Liège Guillemins and Mons( always not finished though)
Overrated architect
It seems like no one gives a damn, tourists are still rolling in here in Brussels
The only thing I notice is that I’m one of the only people when I go to Chinese restaurants or Asian supermarkets
Oh well, I love to shop and eat in peace anyway
Also they recently cancelled an Anime convention because of Corona, which makes me both laugh and cringe
Not that I'm aware of no
I don't think so
If they have, I haven't heard of it
To me, it always seems like what defines a lot of people in this country is apathy
Not only now but even in general
To be fair, our government had the most ingenious solution to the whole problem
If we don't test anyone, no one in our country is sick
Done
What a lovely day
In seriousness I think it's got to be pretty severe (or just football), for a Belgian to give a shit
I mean they wanted to split the country and most of us were like "eh, whatever".
Beautiful by sound rather than meaning:
Hungarian: hogy (that)
Dutch: fluim (phlegm)
Icelandic: fljúga (fly)
Bulgarian: флюс (flux)
I prefer this one:
##Schmetterling
Kinda like "smijten" in Dutch :)
In Dutch it is a "Vlinder", but in all seriousness "Papillon" is the most beautiful word that I know for the species
Yeah, but it's more menacing if you curse it or if you say it in such a way as if it scares you more than anything
We have "gooien", "werpen" en "smijten". The first is the regular throwing
The second is also throwing but more like the sence of throwing discs or javelins, so throwing somethign far away
The third is throwing something hard and not as careful
So I guess it could be either of those depending on context
The first one not so much
I just think of that pig with his unitard in the movie Sing
American-sounding names, like Kevin, Britney etc
Names ending in -y (are often American names)
Very old names, like Yvonne, Mariette, Roland etc
Names from the Netherlands, like Sjoerd, Gerri, Trui etc
Jack
I love the name for a dog, but I don’t like it on a person
Kevin for a man, what is seen as an unattractive name apparently
I had a guy in my class called "Geronimo" and a girl named "Pricilla", also "senia" pronounced like xeniia
These are based only on the fact I'm a Romance-speaker, and thus I base myself on the beauty standards of said languages
No offense is meant to people having these names, which are from another language family

I think Sterre is kinda okay but if you name your kid Puck you want that she is beaten up
Which is of course the use of a Puck anyway
In Belgium also
You literally copy-pasted a list of Dutch names you found online
That's weirdly specific, since most of these names, especially the male ones, are hardly used in Flanders, let alone Wallonia
Have you actually ever come across people with these names
The Dutch can have some really weird names sometimes
If I'm not mistaken it's short for Geertrui / Gertrude, but it's still just asking for your kid to get bullied, though
When you find Geertrui a nice name but some asshole called Geert already ruined the name
Randi
Poor guy
Was it short for something else or was it just Sandy
No, I selected names in a much bigger list
These are the names, that from a Romance-speaking perspective, don't sound good or sound funny
Unfortunatly, Dutch and German don't sound nice for most Romance languages speakers
For us, it is impossible not to find these listed names ridiculous, which doesn't mean they objectively are, they are from the Romance languages perspective
I'm quite sure that from the perspective of some languages, French doesn't sound nice either
Not all Dutch names are there you'll notice
Well, you have Bart de Wever, or you have the Gert character from your Samson en Gert
In our past/"current" government, you had/have as well : Koen Geens, Elke Sleurs
But precisely, these are names that in Wallonia will be seen as sounding either not good, or sound funny, regardless of their rarity
Don't forget Brian and Jordan
It's weird how some French speakers like to go out of their way to say they think Dutch is an ugly language
>For us, it is impossible not to find these listed names ridiculous
Wow, and here I thought there were more than 70 million French speakers in Europe
It's good to know they all think exactly the same thing
I fail to see how Flemish people having Flemish/Dutch names would sound bad or funny in Wallonia
I wonder what you would do when you meet a Turk, an Indian or an Indonesian
Just tell them that their name sounds bad in French
Charlie Chaplin be like
Wasn't there a Dutch girl called Bloem Pot
Edit: Nevermind the parents wanted to call her that but the judge didn't allow it and it was in Belgium
"Chantal in Paris" is a title that I would expect on certain websites
We wouldn't tell to someone that we don't like their name
Finding a name funny or not nice doesn't mean we would spit it to the face of the person
I'm just saying that no one in Wallonia would name his/her child like that, because having such a name in school for example would probably result in mocking by other pupils
You know how cruel children can be, mocking names happens everywhere
I had mine mocked sometimes, either first name or family names, despite the fact they are part of French-speaking names since quite likely centuries
When names are unusual, other children will often find play on words or find derogatory associations, that's a problem everywhere
Nevermind the two (yes, two) people called Peter Selie in my little hometown
Oh and Peter Nis, which doesn't sound so bad until you realise everyone abbreviate Peter to Pé. Pé Nis
My ex-gf's name is Andrea
Was always fun when we went on a holiday to southern Europe or to a place with a lot of Italians
Yeah, I already suspected that he’s very anti-Flanders and this just confirmed that hahaha
>insert dutch joke about belgians being dumb here
Sadly, it's not only a Dutch stereotype
I have no idea where it comes from, but the French (and maybe Germans) also have this stereotype
Oh I know
I would love it if Flanders would reunite with the Netherlands tbh (and Wallonia can come too if they want)
Yes please
The saxophone, roller skates, the Body Mass Index, the cassette tape, the Mercator projection, a lot of weapons like the FN SCAR and probably more that I can't think of
I don't know if I would consider any of them 'great' though
Edit: also, bakeliet, the first plastic
So we have the car, the world wide web, the world map, French fries or waffles
Its definitely French fries
[20 Belgian inventions that changed the world]
The internet, the first form of plastic and the CD
But also the saxophone and Asphalt
... And the bikini
Twice in ten years
You forgot bakeliet
The first plastic
Rijndael the advandced encryption standard is Belgian
Yeah we kinda got shared by the whole continent
Oh yeah you're right
The world wide web
Invented in CERN by a Belgian and a British researcher
Toilets
I can’t begin to describe the rage I felt driving 8 times back to the DIY to fix a toilet’s broken flush system
You’re basically condemned to studying for a degree in toilet manufacturing industry standard variations, or buy a completely new toilet set
There are plenty of providers that work on every car charger (e.g. Plugsurfing) . Ok, you get different rates but they work
Belgium doesn't have a state monopoly on alcohol and we also have liquor stores all over the country
it doesnt differ that much, and a lot of taxes and redistribution goes toward making the in-country difference smaller
The term "collaboration" still has a somewhat negative connotation to it, but it's still used, even outside of WWII context
The term Nazi or fascist is used as an insult though
I see, you've been following the Veronica Inside drama
Isnt there a specific term based of Petain's name
Could be mistaking though
Not sure
> Idk about the french-speaking areas in Belgium, but in Flanders there were many collaborators
There certainly also was collaboration in Wallonia, however it was smaller then in Flanders
In Wallonia I think it was primarily Léon Degrelle and followers, he even met Hitler (and Mussolini) and had the "*Légion Wallonie*" in the Waffen SS
They mainly fought on the Eastern front
Of course there was also much more reason to collaborate in Flanders then in Wallonia
I'm Flemish btw
And no I am not defending collaborators in Flanders (they executed my great-grandfather) I'm simply trying to point something out
I've never heard *collaborateur* as a modern day insult
It's used to describe certain members of a certain far-right party who attended parties and funerals of actual ones, though
Nazi/fascist is also almost never used in my experience
Only on reddit do people speak that way
The only thing I can add here is that my friends from the UK are just very grateful that they can communicate with so many different people without having to learn specific languages
They really are grateful to us for that
If you've ever looked into English language teaching jobs in East Asia you'd have known that even having a degree in English still leaves you less wanted than a native speaker without said degree
Divinity: Original Sin 2
Followed by D:OS 1 as well
Mafia 1 always has a special place in my heart
I'm looking forward to the remaster coming out soon
Arma, Factorio, Beat Saber, KC:D, Space Engineers,... such amazing games :)
Yeah i heard it is verry famous in germany ,but why
German city builders have a special place in my heart
Lol I went to Gamescom (Köln) a decade ago and some of the freebies they were giving out was *Lantwirtshaftsimulator*, it was amazing seeing everybody just run over to get a copy lol
Sweet, thanks for the call
My gues was it is one of the few games you doesn't kill nazis
How was it 10 years ago
Summer of 2012 I remember best
It was already very busy
Saw some esports, League of Legends, I want to say semi finals
Right next to some Starcraft esports
Funny when something happened in the LOL game or SC
Half the crowd looked over to the other side to see what was going on
The Borderlands 2 bus was there, it was close to being released and was hyped
People were queuing for hours to test some games like the latest assassins creed (3)
Took a picture of an employee with a sign saying "the queue is 4 hours from this point lmao
Folks had camping chairs and played Yu-Gi-Oh in queue
I think I myself played some Far Cry (3 I believe), near the end of the day when it wasn't as busy
Mostly just hung around with my friend there for the esports, went by the booths, almost caught a freebie Intel processor being tossed in the crowd
Ended up with a baggie full of random codes, posters, stickers and the German localization of farming sim lol
Also went in 2014 but I don't remember that one as vividly
Bigger esports (LoL) crowd I think
Played Guns, Gore & Cannoli (Belgian studio), and Far Cry 4
Now this fall
Kill nazis with your combine harvester for only 5
Nice,if i am wright i think gore&cannoli is from gent
Idk, they seem to be registered in [Kontich]
Dude not fair this is clickbait ,now i must buy it to know what famous things i can explore
Aaaah the anale triangle
Berlin,DORTMUND, hamburg but i could also visit it today or lets say after the covid
Actually pretty cool that you can make yoghurt with bacteria found down there
Didn't know that
Towards the third season, it became too convoluted
It felt like they kept adding layer on layer of complexion just for the sake of being complex
There's a Belgian series called "Cordon".
High production values, very relevant to the days we are going through
I loved it up to the point where I’m currently rewatching it
I think a lot of people like it as well here but I’m not sure that many people think it’s their favourite netflix series
I would like to thank the UK for supporting our independence from the Netherlands
Thanks France for building the Chooz nuclear powerplant in the utter most corner of their territory
I'd like to thank other founding member countries of the EU for creating such a beautiful union
Destroying our country to go to war with France
I'd like to thank the Netherlands for exporting tv personalities to laugh with
Love Luxembourg for your cheap gas <3
And thanks Switzerland for giving me a great place to be during vacations because my country is flat as fuck
Thank you Netherlands for selling us quality weed
Damn how expensive is Norway if you think Swedish alcohol is cheap
Where are you from
I thought France helped us with that
Aren't we doing the same on the dutch border
I know, but the UK and France were the only ones supporting our independence
France and the UK both supported our independence, but I just say thank you to the UK because France invaded us a couple decades before our independence, I don't want to say thank you for that
(And C'mon, no one like the French)
Go to the subreddit and press the 3 dots in right corner above (if you're on mobile)
Then press 'change user flair'
I like the French a lot more than the British, they're more like us and helped us a lot more in the Belgian revolution
Yeah but it was only for their own interest
(Same with the British)
Okay I don't why I got downvoted
This is litterally what I learned in history class
France wanted us to be independent so they would have a French speaking neighbour and the British wanted the Dutch to be weaker because they were their biggest naval concurrent
And maybe thank Belgium as well, cause you fucked us up as well and we forgave
Yea for me it's the opposite, I generally love the French and dislike the English
In my experience as I've been to France countless times, they're the most friendly and open nationality I know and the English came across to me as the opposite of that
Well then our experience is different
I've been a lot to both France and the UK and the British (especially the Scottish) are much friendlier than the French in my experience
Yea that's why I changed it to the English because the Scottish seem more friendly
Wtf bro no
I'm not saying you weren't friendly but in general, and again this is just my experience, people in France were less friendly than people in the UK
Maybe it's because I didn't talk French idk
It's not like  they were rude, but idk how to describe it, cold maybe
I know that we and The Netherlands have carbonated Iced-Tea from f.e. Lipton and you don't find that everywhere
Can't think of any specific Belgian soft drink to be honest
I would think of Nalu here in Belgium, very popular type of lemon energy drink which I personally enjoy a lot
Yeah it[almdudler] is gaining popularity in Belgium too
Never drunk it tho
What about "tafelbier" I don't know if you could really count is as a soft drink, and not 100% sure whether it's all that local
Finley is Belgian i think and Ritchie but not sure if they are actually popular
Gini and schweppes are popular but i think those are French and UK
Aha
Well, it's something for you too then
I still remember the weird looks I got when I walked through London and my bottle of Iced-Tea (which I still had in my backpack) went "psssshhh" when I opened it
I quite hate it yes
That is a dumb decision they made
I watch videos in both German and English, and yes, it's idiotic
Yeah I hate this like "who is this video from
oh Jacksepticeye
why is the titel in dutch
I've never even seen this or heard about it, but I also have everything set to English
I too have selected dutch and english (my two main languages) and i still have this problem so i think something else is going on here
Me neither
not taboo to talk about it at all
i think it's more taboo to talk about the past, in the countries which weren't under dictatorships, because of some aspects in their history that they simply don't own up to
edit: rip my English grammar
yes sorry my flair is not entirely correct
i live in belgium but I'm from a former dictatorship country
i meant that in my country is not taboo to discuss anything from the past (maybe how abortions were done) and in the second part i was indeed referring to the belgian  history
i found everyone in my belgian family and acquaintances /friends very sensitive to the topic especially woth the last discussion over this subject which reached the news and realised that it's never ever brought up  (of course in a discussion where we tall about history /past etc -  i don't expect this to just randomly pop up as a subject over coffee at work or sunday morning at breakfast)
ANYWAY not trying to open a debate, just offering my anecdotal answer
Always Dutch if available
English, because French dubs are bad and French translations aren't really good either
Oftentimes they aren't very faithful to the original text
English
Even changed my PS4 language to English because some games automatically follow consol language without the option to change it
I absolutely hate Dutch dubs, the voice actors often are shitty for the character they're supposed to portrait and the accent
I don't want to hear people choking on a 'G' every other word, no thanks
Definitely in English, Dutch just sounds very lame
Definitely English
99% of the time in english, but back in the day Serious Sam the Second Encounter got the voice actor of Bruce Willis in french, was awesome
The dub of the first Metal Gear Solid is memorable for is very bad but very funny voice acting
English all the way games in Dutch are kinda annoying and if I’m looking for info or tips it sucks to having to translate everything specifically, same reason why I prefer getting Adobe software in English etc
> great French versioning
Once you have tried the games in English, you realise French versions aren't really great
I come from one of the 2 rural area (Luxembourg province, the other being Limbourg) so I wonder what they are going to say
>stuck up, pretentious, rude, and generally not nice people
Depend on which Town/Region it is: Brabant are usually more stuck up than Brussels and the other region
To some extent the same prejudices OP mentioned are also echoed here, but less so I imagine because you're never far from the city and never far from the countryside in glorious ribbon development Belgium
Yes, I have already had situations where speaking some basic German or some basic Spanish would have been very useful
Just deciding which language to learn next can be quite a difficult thing to decide
Honestly, in a European context, you can never know enough languages
I already speak 3 fairly fluent and am looking into picking up at least 2 more
Personally I speak dutch and English
I'm of the opinion that if you live in Western-Europe(Germany for Middle, Russian for far Eastern) just speak the Lingua-Franca
I'm not going to bother learning Spanish while living here
You don't want to learn dutch that's fine
But at least speak English
If you only speak French that's your problem, not mine
I live 5 kilometers from the dutch border
For them, you would need snow and ice to begin with
We don't even get snow anymore, so no
But even abroad I haven't encountered these
Though sticking torches in snow is something I have seen before
Wow that's beautiful
Afaik not a thing here sadly
No because the last few decades we've barely had any snow
Just need to live in the ardenne !
We got some snow recently :)
Yeah this is post is just the Scandinavians flexing on the rest of us commonfolk Europeans on how much snow they get lol
Lucky you, here it was just shitty weather all weeks long, rain rain and some more cold rain
Dear Luxembourg,
We love you guys,  it's like having a cooler little brother
Dear Liechtenstein,
Your country is so beautiful,  your outdoor film festival is really cool
Dear Andorra,
Your people are so nice
I got lost in you once and a compatriot helped me out tremendously
Dear Malta,
Haven't visited yet and i will make sure to do that add soon as this covid thing clears,  I'm very excited ti come over
Dear Monaco,
I loooooooved your oceanographic museum
Dear Vatican city,
Thanks for preserving all that art
Dear San Marino,
You are still on my list to visit,  i want to eat all the foods
And to all of you: thanks for letting us look big
Dear all countries of Europe with the exception of the Netherlands: We forgive you for forgetting us again (well maybe except Germany, please keep forgetting we exist)
As for the Netherlands, we kind of love you, and we hope you don't mind we only ever visit for the weed
You guys are ok,  you make us giggle with the way you talk and you think we have mountains,  which is so cute
Thanks for the kind words, legit had to smile when reading your les bleus comment
We're still kinda salty about that
Aw gosh
This is really sweet
Making me very hopeful
I love milk, drink it every morning at breakfast
It's not that hard, actually
You just kinda don't eat it
You get used to it really quickly
Yeah but my point is you don't have to and it's easy to live without it
In Flanders we say:”In the hole of Pluto
I don’t know if they say the same thing in the Netherlands, can a Dutch person confirm for me
Het holl van pluto
'the hole of pluto'
that's actually kinda weird now that I think of it
But we use it wright
Yeah we do
That was what i was thinking i think i use this  and niemandsland maybe most, but not that i use it so much the most people will use it for my region or limburg maybe
Don't we use  "Jakamaka" to
Or is that more when we mean somewhere we don't know
I think this is more from people from antwerp that use it
I'm a social worker with the mentally disabled in residential care
Most of our residents are risk patients so we're doing our best to keep the virus out
Even though it's mostly a lost battle I think
Flu also tends to spreid like wildfire through our facility
At the moment most of our daily activities are cancelled and nobody can come in or go outside (except personnel)
That's pretty hard for our residents, who tick on routine in their days
Even Luxembourg lasted longer lol
No but seriously, a lot of countries surrendered
Hey we do the same thing, nice
Never heard anyone say the French are polite lol
We cook them better though
Yeah that's what I always heard
At least the great wall bit has some truth to it, the turkic people kinda originated in the central Asian region
No because there's not a direct connection between Rome and Germans, but those same turkic people did migrate west and ended up in Anatolia as the Sultanate of Rûm, which would go on to become modern day turkey
We literally do, the turkic migrations are well documented and studied extensively
Because skyscrapers are very ugly, have no souls and ruin the personality/style of a city
Skyscrapers cities all look the same to me
I watched *The Alienist*, set in 19th century New York, and if it is an accurate reproduction of 19th century's New York, damn, the city was much more beautiful back then than now, without skyscrapers
Take a look at Brussels, back in the day when there was next to no city planning, they would build sky scrapers or rather tall buildings all over the place, replacing the older smaller buildings, which gave a very unorganised and messy look to the city
Nowadays you will find most new high rise buildings in financial districts, away from the historic centre
Back in the fifties and sixties there actually were some crazy plans to pretty much rebuild Brussels in modernist skyscrapers, but before the majority of these plans remained unfinished or were never started in the first place, leaving the city in some unfinished mess of old architecture (which they really should have preserved more of) cut into pieces by the sixties idea of progress
Even countries like China have started to ban tall buildings
They're not ecological or economical
They don't make sense
They're a status symbol, and little more
Europe never went through the phase of building them because when they started to pop up, Europe didn't have to prove its status
Also, the population in most (at least Western European) countries is more equally decided and not all squeezed into big cities with a lot of space between them
[This place totally needs more skyscrapers
I'm not particularly religious but it just feels a bit blasphemous to build higher than the church, no
This
Especially the manageable and cheaper
Even China is banning buildings over 250m these days
Brussels is the reason other countries and cities in Europe started heavily banning new modern developments, not just skyscrapers
Modern developments in Brussels wiped out entire historical neighborhoods
[Yeah, Antwerp definitely needs more too]
Similar things happened to the McDonalds (and other fastfood/restaurant chains and shops) in Bruges
Ah, British people liking to be the US' lackey and selling their soul again
Sorry, but no skycrapers' cities are more beautiful than Bruges, Gent, Tournai, Leuven, Dinant, Namur
Skyscrapers are depressing blocks of glass and steel with no soul
Maybe also say what it means lol "wie niet weg is is gezien" means "who isn't gone, will be seen", it's only used for hide and seek
Wie niet weg is is gezien
Who not road is, is seen
Please, make that they cat wise
I wouldn't know to be honest, because in my experience Dutch people only use Flemish words to take the mick out of us, which we happily reciprocate
I find it very annoying when a person from France doesn't adapt him/herself to Belgian French
It is very disrespectful and arrogant : you are in Belgium, not France, your French isn't superior to ours
Of course, a Frenchperson can't know all of local nuances, but there are some famous differences it's impossible not to know about, notably : the numbers (70 and 90)
We at the very least expect them to swith to *septante* and *nonante* when here
If I go to France, I'll adapt my French the best I can to the way of France, because that's the respectful thing to do and the best way making sure there won't be confusion or misunderstanding
When I'm in the Netherlands, I sometimes start talking with a Dutch accent because Flemish suddenly sounds very weird in an all-Dutch environment
I'm pretty good at pulling it off but am always worried of what people would think if they knew where I was really from
Ja euh, we doen dat in privé sfeer lol
Collega van me vorige week na zijn reiske naar Amsterdam de week ervoor:
Ik: "en oe was 't?"
Collega: "cavakes eh, alé tging goed"
Ik: "niks da u ambeteerde daar
En zo ja wadde dan
Collega: "ja d'ollanders, kmoe ze ni hein"
Heb beetje dialect gebruikt/vlaams om het gesprek beter naatebootsen lol
Nou, jeejtje, wat geinig
Ja iets in die aard
En natuurlijk allemaal voor de grap en dergelijke, niets gemeend, zal zeker meer grapjes uithalen aan de andere kant van de grens wanneer ik de kans nog is krijg ;)
Big love terug, Nederlandssprekende broeders
de "amai" hoor ik zo vaak terugkomen bij Nederlanders die Vlaams nadoen
Zeggen jullie dat nooit
We don’t really use ‘nou’ or ‘jeetje’ tbh
The French are never happy about their president
I'm 38 years old and I've never known a French president that wasn't super unpopular
Not saying they're wrong, but it seems like being the President of France makes you by default, unpopular
Why do French and German people dub everything
Is it that hard to reas subtitles (or learn English lol)
I remember when we watched documentaries in class, we had the option between just the English version with Dutch subtitles or the Dutch dubbed version
Every
Single
Person
Always chose the English version
Maybe because the Dutch one is usually done by someone from the Netherlands with a annoying accent (no offence)
> Why do walloons refuse to speak dutch
A bad education system where they need to chose between Dutch and English
For all the other Belgians shoot me but I think some Walloons also still feel a little superior speaking French
I've never heard of anyone drinking cold coffees
I didn't know it was a thing
In Switzerland there never really was one linguistic community that forced its language on the others, like the British/Anglo-Canadians did in Quebec or the French speaking bourgeoisie in Flanders
The only real division there was religious (catholic vs protestant) and they even had a short civil war in the 1800s. But nowadays religion is a lot less important in general
The Flemish and Quebecois identity were formed in opposition to that other dominant culture, and this is not something that can easily be glossed over
>However, as a Dutchie I love the slight stab we always love to give each other while talking about the other country
Nothing but love from your northern neighbour
Haha I just had to do it
It's almost obligated
Do your ministers own bars
Because that would explain everything
No, sadly I haven't been there
What is weird to me is how long your lunch break is
Instead of it having 2 hours make it one hour and be home one hour earlier, seems the better option to me honestly
Otherwise I kind of follow your reasoning, relative to the sun it is a more standard schedule
I prefer my breakfast at around 8, lunch at 13 and dinner around 19 for a work day
This would be ideal but most of the time not really practical
Just wanted to add a "bic" for a ball-point pen
I don't think normal Dutch does this, but I happen to live close to France, who probably influenced us
Alot of the brands that are already commented: pampers, tippex,
But also bic, it's a brand of pens, lighters, pencils
We call a pen a bic now
There are plenty, but "bic" for a pen is the first one to come to mind
In turkey « fön makinası » means hairdryer (makina= machine)
The blinds reminded me, a (slanted) roof-window is usually called a *Velux* here, I think
I know I do
Are **Bic** for certain pens and **K-Way** for jackets that fit into small bags (different from a poncho
) also as common in the Netherlands as they are in Belgium
I have also often heard (and used to use myself) **Jeep** for all Jeep-like off-roading cars
>7-up for lemon lime softdrink
Is Sprite not popular there
everybody does
Not in Dutch, but apparantly in english dragon and kite can be both used for, well, 'kite'.
In Dutch:
•Dragon = Draak
•Kite = vlieger
Vlieger could be translated literally to 'fly-er' but probably comes from an outdated word for pilot
In Flemish it also means airplane
No, in French dragon is *dragon*, while kite is *cerf-volant* : "flying-deer".
Don't ask why, I don't know
It's not really butchered Dutch but rather that old Dutch evolved into Afrikaans,  Standard Dutch and the variants of the latter
Afrikaans is really funny though
For example 'aftrekplek' is a place where you can get information
It comes from Dutch as
•__'Aftrekken'__ is  'pulling/tearing something of something' (which is how info boards used to work)
•__'Plek/plaats'__ which stands for 'place/spot'.
But in modern Dutch 'aftrekken' has the connotation of 'pulling you off' (masturbation)
Hence for Dutch/Flemish people that would mean that
•Aftrekplek = masturbation spot
German is just overcomplicated Dutch
Chinese tourists standing on the edge of a rock in the Grand Canyon that was hanging over the abyss
They could’ve all died that day
Next to the Windsor Castle, I heard an American tourist ask "why did they build it so close to the airport
". Well well well
Brussels, Belgium a year or two ago
During the month of december there is a large open air christmas market that’s spread out over the city
It brings in lots of tourists and some inconvenience for the locals
Two American couples walk into a café (bar)
It’s pretty crowded, around 20-30 patrons are drinking and talking
‘Hi, are you open
’. The bartender looks around and answers ‘We certainly are’. ‘Great
’ Answers the tourist, ‘Do you also serve Belgian beer
’ A few patrons start laughing, but the bartender answers unphased: ‘We certainly do
And I’ll even pay you a round if you promise not start talking about politics
Walk on the cobblestone roads in Leuven
That's a legit road you doofus
In Etosha National Park, Namibia we spotted a male lion sleeping 5 meters next to the road
We parked and quietly enjoyed the sight
After a few minutes we saw a jeep coming in (way over the speed limit) from the opposite direction
They made a sliding emergency stop right next to us -as they probably saw the lion last minute- and reversed a few meters to get a better view
They were driving an open top Land Cruiser ([example] Leaving the engine on, the tourists took place in the roof hatch while screaming and shouting
The lion -already woken up by the emergency stop- was obviously not amused by this, and started to growl and flex his muscles with a death-stare towards the jeep
Completely oblivious about the fact they were pissing off the king of the jungle, the French (speaking) tourists were loudly laughing and talking while taking selfies
This went on for about 15 minutes, while I was stressfully waiting for the inevitable thing to happen
But it didn't.
[Sleepy kitty]
[Pissed off kitty]
Saw it both in Brussels and Amsterdam (especially in Amstersam though), tourists getting their bikes stuck on the tram lines
Also here in Brussels we have an app called "dott" which is like an electric scooter rental and tourists love it even tho they can't use it properly and mostly drive on the sidewalks despite it writing "Do not use on sidewalks".
A bit less serious but a friend of my sister was in front of the big station in Ghent and he went like,
"Fuck, I lost my bag of weed".
"Stop talking so loudly, there are cops here
"What are they going to do
I lost my weed so I have none on me
A bus drove [here]
You could get a fine for this in Belgium but only if the cop who writes the ticket is having a bad day
r/chinesetourists
It was very spectacular
Atheist, rather anti-religious
You don't start fights in places of worship ffs
How insensitive can one be
Have a modicum of respect for your fellow man
I once witnessed him asking a loud, beligerant drunk to leave the bar
The drunk was a big boy and very threatening at first
It took about two minutes and ten metres from the bar to the door
But when they finally reached the door, the drunk was actually thanking him for being thrown out
Never knew what he said exactly, but it was impressive
España
I live in Belgium, and I have never heard of St
Pauli
Actually, most of Germany is a mystery for most of us
We hear about French news, we know about France, but Germany
Most French-speakers of the country (40% of the pop) don't care about it
That's the reason, also South America
A lot of Spanish and South American immigrants where I live
It's only optional to learn Spanish tho, I did because my uncle is Cuban
This is one of those stereotypes I never understood living in Belgium
If I want to hang up say, a coat hanger, I need to drill into brick and concrete
I always love the "contradiction" between "place with a lot of land but crappy wooden bungalow
No need to tell you that in our countries a lot of land tends to mean a nice looking house because of prices for land
Well, thank you for these informations
Would you recomment visiting Hamburg
For now, I'm only "familiar" with the Rhineland, and have seen Trier, Köln, Düsseldorf and Neuß.
Well it's not because of the immigrants I think but it's partially making the language more popular
All I could think of looking at these homes in Tennessee and such(was there for work) was that it would be useful for my sister to have access to these
She has 2 border collies who need their space and because of wealthy parents she'll have no problem getting the space but it will cost easily over 500k.
Over there she could get a decent home + the land for like 300k I imagine
Thank you
Well, Brussels is our capital, but the inhabitants of Antwerp have a fun way of referring to the rest of the country
There is this common saying amongst the older, proud people of Antwerp which basically translates to ‘there’s Antwerp, and the rest is the parking space
No, that's not a thing here
Brussels region harbor only 1 million people on 11 million, and Brussels City itself is only around 300 000 people
While Brussels is often talked about in our medias, we aren't a centralised country
What we make is a distinction between towns/cities, and countryside/peasant area
It's not just arrogance, it's also partly out of necessity
Because it's near impossible to find a parking space in Antwerp
"#slimnaarantwerpen"
oh but that saying is alive and well under younger people too you know
I, for one, happen to use it sometimes
Also people are not interested in brussel it doesn't feel like belgium
Goes without saying but we usually talk about either Flanders or Wallonia when we're not speaking about Belgium as a whole
We mostly compare Flanders to Wallonia instead of the capital to the rest of the country
It was almost 10 years ago, I was about 20
I was living in London with a Swiss girl and we both spoke French together (I'm from Belgium)
We went to that big park where on Sunday morning people can come and express themselves
Some talk about politics, some about religion
We were really excited by what we saw, we really liked that idea of being able to have these public debates
On our way back home, we sat next to a man who was writing in a little Bible
So I said to my friend, he's probably preparing himself for next Sunday
Which was not meant in a mean way, I meant it like for these debates
But he also spoke French and thought I was making fun of him being religious
I tried to explain myself but it just made him angrier
So I just said sorry and sat there feeling stupid and ashamed haha
I don't think I ever had that problem visiting other countries, notthe Netherlands not France (the others we visited I was a youngling in plastic fairy wings)
I do think keeping up with trends and such is fairly big here
I'm Belgian and lived in Australia
Had some British and American friends who asked me if I was going out
I asked them why they thought so and said because I was dressed so nicely
I said these are my daily clothes
In conclusion:
The Germans are the Americans of Europe when it comes to dressing
The western Mediterranean does it best
I think we do put a good amount of effort into dressing well in general when we go out of our homes
I do think it's quite easy to blend in there, I've never experienced any weird looks or seen any type of clothing we don't wear here
And I don't live near the border either
Clogs aren't what other countries would call 'chic'...
I have a South-Korean colleague who joined us not long ago, after working in Germany for 2 years
She said “the Belgians have a way better taste in clothes than the Germans”. I have never thought that about Germans but apparently others do
well I do think there's some things you just don't do, if you go out in sweatpants they'd have to be within the range of sweatpants that you can leave the house with and should be paired with something good, and mainly stuff like that
I suppose it's something you get or are accustomed to living, what's aloud where
I feel naked if I leave the house in sweatpants
I think dressing to fit is one of the more important parts here
You don't wear certain stuff certain places and if you go overboard (regularly) you'll be gossiped about and generally seen as someone in dire need of attention
Fair enough, carry on
Honestly I did it once and it felt so of I went back to change, but there's people who do it, generally though they are LO en sport, so nine hours of sports a week not counting hobbies and that seems reasonable, even then there's a say in which type
I live only a kilometer away from the French border, so it's definitely at least once a week
For Belgium as a whole it's very common to cross the border for business or pleasure
I live about half an hour away from France
I actually don't go there that often, maybe a few times a year
There's this shopping area I would go to not far over the border, but I'm not that big on shopping
But the company I work in has many French employees, so those people cross the border on a daily basis
(Not counting in Corona-situation of course)
I don't need a passport, my Belgian ID card is good enough, no one's checking (except for in certain situations maybe, but I never had it)
If you missed the [road sign] you wouldn't even realize you crossed the border into a different country
&#x200B;
When I was little, there were less IKEA's in Belgium, the closest one to my home was in France, so that's where we went
When we used to still buy bottled water (now we drink tap), once every month or every few months my dad went to a French supermarkt to get water, it was a little detour on his way home from work, but the water was way cheaper
I heard that in the Netherlands, people who live close to the border with Belgium cross the border to refuel their cars
I've also heard about Belgians going to the Netherlands to buy glasses, apparantly they're cheaper there
As we are a small country, we have easy access to the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Germany, France and in lesser extend the UK
From where I live I can be in all border countries in an hour (by car or train), the UK a bit more by train (~2h)
A passport is not necessary as we have national IDs, a lot of Belgians will not have a passport as they mainly travel within the EU
It is indeed quite common to casually go to the border countries, just for a quick day out or some shopping
Especially so of course if you live or are staying close to the border
People living close to the border will often do their standard shopping/filling up gas if it's cheaper across the border
Also in school day trips to other countries are relatively common
Sometimes in the weekends me and my brother drive somewhere for a daytrip
There are no borders anymore around here
I grew up on the border with Holland and Germany
My mom and sister both live in Holland
My sister studied in Holland while living in Belgium so she actually did the cross border commute for quite a few years
When borders closed between Belgium and Holland during Corona lockdown it was so extremely weird to not be able to move in our own region
I know we're spoiled and a lot of cross border people have that luxury but honestly
If your people like us Limburgers live on both sides of an arbitrary border it really shouldn't be there in the first place
Abolish nationalism
Yes it's very normal
I live in Germany now, but I work in Belgium, so I cross a border every day
The commute is only 30 minutes
The nearest Ikea is in the Netherlands, and is also about 30 minutes away
We often go there on weekends
My parents, who still live in Belgium, do their grocery shopping in Germany every week because it's cheaper
Like other commenters said, you only need your european ID and you're good
The borders are open and nobody's here to check you
If you aren't paying attention, you won't even know you've crossed a border
> Even though im quite definately sure you would need a passport
Schengen zone residents don't need the passport, just the ID card
>  Is it just normal to go from country to country on a practically daily basis
Plenty of people work in another country and they cross the border daily without controls, etc and you can add in the list those that do their shopping in another country because it is cheaper
Also imagine the passport checks and ensuing chaos here
No, when you cross the border the language changes, laws change, cultures and social norms change, ....
It's not because there are open borders that the countries have merged, each country still very much has its own identity
We went to Barcelona and London in 11th grade and Paris in 12th(which was just a language test basically and sucked balls)
Barcelona was us drinking on the beach mainly during the evenings
London we hired a limo in central London past midnight by pooling some money and drove to "the Eye" and all that drinking champagne in the back with 10 students
Good times
Yes, teachers are fine with it
Bit of a pain finding a place to get alcohol sometimes in foreign countries
Age for alcohol is 16 here
Think we also nipped over the border to visit Lille(Northern France) for a day and my father had a season's ticket for their football club for a while back when Hazard played for them
Sometimes joined him
Living close to the border with the Netherlands we often sell some of our stuff to the dutch(we sell swimming pools) and when biking/hiking we often end up there on accident
Keep in mind if a dutch person talks 3 words to me I can tell they're not from Belgium, even if it is the same language
It's impossible to hide basically
edit: Ow, and as I do live close to the dutch border we went to look at the "afsluitdijk". Basically one of the parts when we learned about water in like 5th grade
My sister works there (crosses the border for work, OP)
Her company expanded over the years and has the border running through the building
Ok so only travel-wise yes, it's a bit like travelling within the US
It is very true
How well people can speak neighbouring countries language depends very much on the residents language abilities (and willingness)
Even within Belgium, if I travel southwards 15km and cross the language border everything will be in French
I will have to order at the bakery in French, all signs will be in French, and the information on the train will all of a sudden only appear in French on the digital signs
And 90% (probably more) of the people will not be able to help me out in Dutch, even in the border towns
Even if I travel to the Netherlands, where they still speak my language, the cultural difference is immediately obvious
Not necessarily depending on your mode of transportation and the regulations of the country you are in
But yes, it is always a good idea to carry a passport/ID when you travel
In Belgium we have to carry an ID at all times, so for us it's standard to have these with us even when travelling
I took a plane from Brussels to Barcelona to visit a fair for work and back and wasn't asked for an ID once
Correct on the dialect thing
The dialect of Cologne according to a German:
"Dat konnemi vorstelle datte de verstehst",
Mildly dialect dutch:
""Da kun(ne)ke me nie voorstelle datte/daje da versta(t)"(I mean, multiple options)
In normal dutch:
"Ik kan me niet voorstellen dat je dit verstaat"
And in English
I can't imagine you understand that
(so basically the verb and "that" gets switched in terms of sentence structure)
I went their with my school last year
We didn't realise their was a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights so we just ran on the streets and hoped we didn't get hit by a car
Holy shit Corsica
Went on vacation by car there and they don't give a single fuck
Overtaking you in a blind corner in the mountains while blasting "bella ciau" and using their hand as turn signal
Maybe "bistro". Which I believe comes from russian
Those words or expressions that mix dutch, italian and arabian are interesting
Gabber comes from Yiddish
lmao awesome
Interesting to see that the majority of these words are practically never used in Belgium
The Finnish word, along with those of the Scandinavian languages, is actually derived from the Dutch word 'kalkoen', which is a shortened form of the older Dutch word 'Calcoetsche hoen'. 'Hoen' is an older word for bird and 'Calcoetsch' refers to the Indian city of Calicut
Never heard that phrase
I do like the drink Pisang tho
Mokkel gets used as 'mokke' at least where I live but beside that
yeah pretty much never
Oh yeah now I hear it
Yeah ‘mokke’ seems to be the only one
Though I haven’t heard it in a while
Back in the early 2010’s teenage girls used to comment it on each other’s profile pics all the time
It seems to be trending again very recently
That was popular when I was young and hip in the early 2000's.
In native speakers it's French
Third is Arabic, mostly because of Moroccan immigrants
If we're talking native speakers *and* L2 speakers, than French is the most spoken and Dutch is the second most spoken language
German would be 3rd (4th actually, after English), followed by Spanish
If I remember correctly: Italian or arabic
They are both spoken more than german which is an official language in Belgium
Almost half of our country speaks french so yeah french
Yeah, I believe more than 15% is Kurdish in Turkey
That's a lot
I was surprised to see so many kids have no idea how to use a fucking computer but are really good with their smartphones
I'm shit with smartphones
Not because I'm old or dumb but because for me, a phone must call, text, do basic apps, wake me up and have an agenda tool
I don't really give a shit about all those other apps
I never used it
I guess I was in the wrong (right
) circles
In my experience it's a minority who actually use it
I imagine about 10% in my social circle and throughout uni most phased it out
Its tolerated, we can grow legally, have a small amount with us without getting arrested or permanent repocussions
We cant smoke it publically though
And if you follow the law correctly you cant drive any vehicle 2 days after useage
Criminal procequtions are only reserved if they can prove you have intend to sell or carry a large amount considered too much  for personal use  I believe its maxed at 5grams anything over can follow to proceqution but it rarely happens
Its not too common and less and less youth smokes it
Its main users are between 20 and 40 years old
I'd say less than 10% smokes on a regular basis
I used to believe it was way higher but considering when you smoke you tend to befriend other smokers faster
Ever since I quit I've noticed a lot of people dont smoke it at all
I went to your country in september this year and we were able to buy weed within 5 minutes of starting to search for some
So I would say it is quite common
This was in a touristy place tho (Plovdiv), so maybe thats why
I feel like it does indeed mostly depend on your social circles
Pretty much everyone I know (say 90%) uses it
That doesn't mean they are all heavy users of course
Most of them, like me, just have a little stash they keep hidden away for social opportunities
A bit like having a drink with your friends
It's a nice alternative once in a while and not at all taboo or anything
However, older people and the police tend to treat it like it's the devils drug and a danger to society as we know it, while in reality alcohol or tobacco destroy so much more lives on a yearly basis than I think weed ever will
I have the total opposite experience
In Brussels I get asked if I wanna buy/sell weed all the time
In Ghent there's a large community who smoke fairly often too
Most young people have a neutral/positive view towards it I feel
French : Thibault, Thibaut, Thibauld, Thibaud, Thibaudt, Tibo,... I wouldn't be surprised if there are more versions hahaha
Not that I know of, but we have several names that are written differently depending on which language they speak: French or Dutch
Kristof and Christophe
Karolien and Caroline
Kristiaan and Christian
Stefaan and Stephane
Just a few examples
I have never seen Michael being spelled as Mikel or Maikel lol
I know of a Thibeau
I probably make as many mistakes in my native language as I do in English because I can't be bothered to double check everything and spend a lot of time on proper syntax
I was leading raids in world of warcraft when I was 16 and people thought I was from England after I told them where I was from several weeks later
Was fun
It 's so cool to such variety of Europeans comment
Same in Belgian Dutch, spoorweg
If i read your user name you speak dutch as well
Not that controversial
The most right wing people would see it as a real problem and the rest honestly wouldn't care much
Well since our federal government is quasi-powerless, nobody would give a shit
But if by "in another country", you mean an Middle-eastern/African country, it would be a shitstorm never seen in the history of Belgium
I'm just impressed people know where their Head of State is born
I don't know the name of our current PM
I know it's a woman but I have no idea where she's born
Are people interested in that sort of thing
I'm somebody that's only really interested in what politicians actually do
Well, as we're a monarchy, the chances of our head of state being born in another country are slim, but not impossible
According to article 86 of the Constitution, if there is no apparent heir, the government can appoint an heir who has to be approved by both legislative chambers with a two-thirds majority
As far as the prime minister is concerned, he'd would need to have Belgian nationality to even become (prime) minister (article 97 of the Constitution), but in theory he could be born in another country
Not sure if it would go over well
We have some pretty nationalist parties who would surely attack him/her on it
Not really, it depends on the context
If you mean by head of state: people from the royal family
Well they're the royal family of Belgium so normally they're Belgians and their future successors are too
But let's imagine that for example, Queen Mathilde would have been abroad when she gave birth to Elisabeth (the crown prinsess, so our future queen)
I don't think people would make an issue out of that
She's still going to be brought back to Belgium and grow up here
&#x200B;
If you're talking about the prime minister
I don't think that would have been an issue as long as it is someone that has a Belgian citizenship, grew up for the most part in Belgium and clearly is very well integrated in the Belgian culture
A previous Prime Minister: Elio Di Rupo
He was born in Belgium, as a child from Italian immigrants, apparantly he was the only person in his family born in Belgium
His family moved to Belgium in 1947 and he was born in 1951
Honestly I don't think people would have made a big deal out of it if he was born in Italy in 1951 and in 1952 his family moved to Belgium
I can't imagine that being a problem
Another previous Prime Minister: Jean-Luc Dehaene was born in France
(He also died in France in 2014) But he was son to a Belgian family
His family was fleeing during the second world war, I think they returned to Belgium in the same year he was born
So it's not like he grew up in France
So purely birth place doesn't have much significance
I think it would be different if they grew up in a different country and then came to Belgium at the age of 15 or later
They probably wouldn't have made it to Prime Minister to begin with
And if they did make it that far, then that probably shows how well integrated they are in Belgium that people would vote for them as a leader/representative of the country, and in that case I don't see the problem either
Wasn't his mother an American citizen
So what does it matter where he was born
His mother seems white so he seems half and half
De Tijd for Flanders
De Tijd is the only newspaper that is doing some serious investigative journalism
They were a part of the team that broke the news on the Panama Papers
Also besides them we have this twitter account called ArbiterOfTweets
Nobody exactly knows who he/she is, but it’s know that the person behind the twitter account is a journalist
Whenever we have a story in Belgium he factchecks it, and he is damn good at it
Do they only attack right wing or also left wing
So the ey also attacked hollande
What does they say about macron
England
Flanders has always had a close connection to England (wool trade) plus it helps that we both had the same enemy (France)
Over the years the relation stayed and we considered them as our big brother (World War 1 and World War 2)
But as in every family we sometimes have turbulent times
I think France and the UK because these were the only 2 countries supporting our independence
Luxembourg cause they’re our only neighbor that didn’t try to conquer us
The Turkic Nations, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Kyrgzstan, Uzbekistan and Hungary (Hungary surprised me but it turns out we come from the Huns that fled to Anatolia)
Hence the name HUNgary
They even have a statue of Attila
Well historically you and Scotland were bff's because of England
[This one is my fave
get your boomer ass out of here
Self burns, gag comics and sometimes a bit to the darker side
Self mockery combined with sarcasm and casual racism
And don't forget the joke about the french !
Don't forget it can get very surreal
Like our art or political system
And also about the Dutch
In short, we are the joke
Belgian and French are natural enemies !
Juste like Belgian and  Dutch !
And Belgian and other Belgian !
Those damn Belgian they ruined Belgium !
It's also fun to laugh at Limburg, even more so because their responce time is so slow
And the West-Flemish ofcourse
Which is fun, because you can't understand their comebacks anyway
Our minister of environnement and agriculture got a lot of hate in 2018 for her respons to climate change
Some students got her phone number and loads of people where sending her messages to do more
She went to speak to farmers and claimed the entire movement was a russian hoax and that the secret service had given her proof that the Russians were behind it all
Turned out that was one big lie and she resigned crying pretty heavily:
I'm happy at least one of our absolutely terrible politicians at least got her comeuppance
Too bad she hasn't been completely dumped by her party, and crazily enough people still vote for Schauvliege
Its indeed sad that she still has a political career
I have absolutely no empathy for her whatsoever
The government we don't have
We have too many governments and not enough governments
We have governements
But not a government
Well, yes but actually no
Shit's complicated
I'd say me but I don't run
Our minister of health's message about the corona virus
Someone made a remix of it
One line in particular was taken out of context
"blijf in u kot". It basically means " stay in your cage"
You shouldn't start to worry untill he starts to base decisions on our road polices
At least you have one
That's kind of crazy most of us only remember the counter vs Japan and that it was our best performance at a world cup ever
It's sad but somehow a little impressive how functional this dysfunctional country is
we're so used to that by now that the fun is more or less gone
She is obese but she is a GP so she at least knows what she is talking about
She's facing some heavy critique ATM because of corona and her choice of words however when she told people to stay inside
haha that was a good video
It's functional
Just very inefficient
The thing that surprises me is how many people follow American politics religiously and then import American problems into European countries
It's often really quite surprising as issues in the US are often times non existent or different in Europe
I follow French politics a lot because of cultural influebce and my online friends post lots of memes about it too
I also follow Spanish politics to a certain extent due to part of my family being from there
I don't really follow our own politics all that much apart from the bigger stuff
I do try to at least have a general idea about Dutch politics though
And the news already says enough about US, UK and French politics so I automatically know something about that
Well Belgian politics are already exhausting enough, so other than that I only really follow what's going on in the EU
For the rest I just get my information from whatever breaks through in the news here
f.e. I know the Dutch are going through some shit right now but I don't really know the details of it
Yes, I follow Dutch and British politics, and to a lesser extent French and German as well
I care a lot about Belgian and EU politics,  but not really about the politics of individual foreign countries
I try to stay up to date with important information tho
Oh you're into the weird shit aren't you
Why Bulgaria
Belgium must be the only country that has a viable separatist movement for its majority community
Not exactly
We indeed didn't have a federal government for some time but we had 5 others to keep the country running
Belgium is the only place with no government but too many at the same time
I don't know if scary is the right word but I have to say that the area around Ypres in West Flanders, with the dozens of war cemeteries has a dark vibe I have not come across too often
There are hundreds of thousands of graves of soldiers who died in WWI and death seems to be everywhere
It's absolutely mind boggling to try to even imagine the sheer amount of people who died there during the war
I can highly recommend the Flanders Fields museum in Ypres, it's really good and informative but will also break your heart
In Prague we visited one of the cemeteries, I think it was the Jewish one, olsany ... Part of it was so old that some graves were caved in and you could see bones inside
We visited one of the hottest days of summer and it was actually quite pretty
People usually start around the age of 15, but drinking gets legal at 16 so they don’t so it for too long
Very popular, probably ever preteen is doing it
Belgium here
Most people start drinking when they're around 14-16
15 is the "they buy themselves a beer" age
Simply tasting alcohol tends to be earlier for most I believe
buying alcohol becomes legal at 16, there's no legal age to drinking it
Anyone under say, 14, gets tastes
Not entire glasses
I was given a bit of wine in a restaurant when I was 12 for example
About 2 gulps worth
Really
So when the police sees a 13y old drinking alcohol, they can’t stop him/her
I had no idea
Isn't that how it is in most countries though
I think it's similar here, but it's not illegal for youngsters to acquire it
Only for others to aid them in doing so
Of course, if they are extremely drunk in public, and it becomes a real issue, the child and the parents might have some talks with child protective services
Not really
In French I'd say "c'est une facon de voir la chose" which means "it's a way of looking at it" or you could simply say you disagree but respect his opinion
Same for me, I'm having a hard time thinking about something
The best I could come up with is just "oké dan" or "het zal wel".
Nog nooit gehoord haha
Ik zou 'het zal wel zeker' zeggen
How about "Allez dan"?
When talking I feel you can bring over the sentiment almost with a simple "k".
Oh yeah defenitally
Forgot about that one
A lot of people, mainly younger ones, have 1 first name and 1 last name, usually the last name from the father, although a couple years ago a law was passed that made it possible to use the mother's last name or both last names
Some people have 2 or 3 first names (or however they're called in English)
These are often the first names of their Godmother and Godfather
But this is more rare these days
Middle names are rarely used as far as I know
So most of the time my just first name and family name
I also have three given names
First name + name godfather + name godmother (godmother-godfather if you're a woman) and then last name
It must be a Catholic thing indeed
Although it is quite old-fashioned because not everybody has that
also changing your name has become easier (if you have a good reason)
In Ghent you can even do it for free
In Brugge you can do it too
I there's a fee tho
I guess you can change your name anywhere in Belgium, but they made it free here, I dunno why
I'd say that globally, Germany is the exception rather than the rule
Not so many countries acknowledge the horrors and the wrongdoings of their past
About Belgium though, there are several reasons, I'd say
At the population level, people aren't always very conscious or knowledgeable about what happened
Colonization is often studied in school as a global phenomenon, talking more about Spain, Portugal, France, the UK, etc, than about Belgium
Congo is mentioned, of course, but it doesn't get the spotlight it should
I left school more than 10 years ago so my memory isn't all that fresh, but I really don't remember anything about it in my history classes
I think that it also depends on what teacher you have and where they choose to put the emphasis in the lesson
Next to this problematic lack of knowledge about what happened, there is also the fact that Leopold II was a relatively decent King for Belgium as a country
What he did in Congo was absolutely terrible, but from the Belgian standpoint, he *did* bring back riches and built a lot of grand monuments
He is actually more remembered as the Builder King than as the abhorrent Congo colonizer, although I feel that it's starting to change
Finally, there is also the fact that people don't usually like to acknowledge the horrors of their forefathers, even if they had nothing to do with it
It's just some kind of nationalistic reaction (although Belgian nationalism is very low)
The first reaction to this discussion is automatically "the Congo Free State was a personal colony of Leopold, not of Belgium". It's true and shouldn't be forgotten by putting all the blame on the Belgian government, but in a balanced debate, one should also acknowledge that many Belgians did participate in it as mercenaries, and that Belgium itself benefited from it
On the political side of things, neither the government nor the parliament have ever officially apologized for it, as far a I know
There is some ongoing progress, however, as the government officially apologized this very year to the children and grand children of mixed union (Belgian father with Congolese mother, often mistresses) for the discrimination they've suffered from in the 1940s-50s. Slow progress, but progress nonetheless
About broader apologies for its colonization past, it's not on the table yet
UN experts recommended this spring in a report that Belgium apologizes, but it wasn't followed by the government
From what I remember, the reactions to this report weren't very enthusiast even in the population and in the media
It would take some courage from the government (something that is currently lacking) to apologize because the population doesn't seem to like the idea (for the reasons explained above)
I would like to see a poll about this though
I hope I could answer your question
Bear in mind that I am no expert at all, and it all comes from my personal experience and following the media
Other Belgians might have other things to say, or even refute some of what I wrote
Do we not admit what happened
Because the worst atrocities were committed when Congo was the personal property of Léopold II, not Belgium
And one of the reason the government take control of Congo was to stop said atrocities
Furthermore, while abjects acts were committed, it was not worse than in any other colonial empire
Everyone seems concern with Belgium, but France and the UK were as bad
I think it's fair to mention that Belgium:
Criticised the king when he took control over Congo
Did not enable the king, with one exception in (3)
Gave the king only a loan to build railroads in Congo to "modernise" this
The king actually got rid of governments that didn't want to do this through some clever political manouvering
Plenty of other countries helped out king in his venture
Once it was revealed what the king had been doing, despite having no jurisdiction over the matter, the Belgian state expropriated the colony anyway
The king destroyed all documents, and died immediately after, making a punishment impossible
The current position of the Belgian government is that they'll eventually apologise for colonialism (after all, even after the king died, Belgium still treated it as a colony)
However, the Belgian state doesn't want to apologise now because the current regime isn't democratic either, and it doesn't want to apologise for undemocratic leadership to undemocratic regimes
Belgium pays a lot of foreign aid to Congo, and monitors the situation extremely closely
It is not
What I want to say is that the Belgian government was not involved it the managing of Congo by Léopold II, and therefore should not have to apologize for what he did
But well for what happened after it takes control of Congo from the king
This question is comming from someone who lives (or lived your flair doesn't specify) in the US: a country that conciders accusing US soldiers of war crimes a valid reason to start a war with the Netherlands
> At the population level, people aren't always very conscious or knowledgeable about what happened
That has not been my experience at all
Everyone I know bar elementary school children know about what happened
> From what I remember, the reactions to this report weren't very enthusiast even in the population and in the media
It would take some courage from the government (something that is currently lacking) to apologize because the population doesn't seem to like the idea (for the reasons explained above)
I would like to see a poll about this though
The Belgian government doesn't want to apologise because it doesn't consider the current regime better than the Belgian regime
It's better than the regime under Leopold, but Belgium had no control over that and criticised it from the start, so it would be unfair to push responsibility over
Especially since other countries funded the king's ventures, while Belgium was quite reluctant in doing so
Out if the two loans he received, one wasn't meant for Congo but misused, and one was meant for Congo but he had to essentially kick out a government to get it
The latter was meant to be used exclusively for building railroads
> there is also the fact that Leopold II was a relatively decent King for Belgium as a country
What he did in Congo was absolutely terrible, but from the Belgian standpoint, he did bring back riches and built a lot of grand monuments
He is actually more remembered as the Builder King than as the abhorrent Congo colonizer
Lolwhat
Leopold II is known as the king who sent the cavalry charge with sabers against Belgians who were demonstrating and fighting to have the right to vote
He was a terrible king, both in Congo and in Belgium
Tbh I had to learn about our kings when I was 10
Not the ideal time to talk about his atrocities
There are no legitimate demands for reparations
This isn't 1919 Versailles
Reparations just create more hate
After the Napoleonic wars and after the Franco-Prussian war in 1871 France had to pay reparations
The French carried anger and frustration for more than a century
The reason demands on Germany and Austria were so harsh was because the French didn't want to relent
Do we really want to go back to an era of pointing fingers
History is filled with atrocities
There will be no end to disputes and conflicts when you start going down that road again
No one will vote to remove it, as they think there are more important issues
A very small minority (racists and people blind to bad parts of the royal family) will vote against anyone that removes it
It's electoral idiocy to remove them
And politicians who make dumb electoral moves don't get elected
Officially not, but every one knows it
If you go back to the reality in the late 19th century, for Belgians it was pretty simple
Belgium didn't have control about Congo, Belgium didn't have a colony, the parliament didn't have anything to say about Leopold II, parliament didn't get any information about Congo, Belgian citizens didn't get any news about Congo
It was a place in africa those people maybe heard about because some belgians moved to Congo and mostly never came back
In 1908 it changed a bit, because it became a belgian colony, and people who moved to congo or had to do with it, all (incl
movements) had their own agenda
But almost nobody was involved with congo to let it grow as a state
Belgians moved because they could build a big house, work as a teacher and retire in the sun (far away from belgian problems)
Catholics moved over to preach and spread Catholicism/"civilisation". Some people from our armies because because they saw career opportunities
In Belgium it was still something people didn't hear about
And yes, on reddit you hear a bit more sentiments about it not being a colony in the late 19th century
Mostly as a reaction towards foreigners who know nothing about our colonial history but still point their fingers towards 21th century Belgians
> That has not been my experience at all
Everyone I know bar elementary school children know about what happened
I didn't mean that people wouldn't know anything about it, but I feel that for most people, it's just about regular colonization + chopped hands
The full extent of the Congo Free State atrocities is barely known
Everyone's experience is different, but from mine, younger people are more likely to know about it, through evolving history programs and increased internet access
>  Leopold II is known as the king who sent the cavalry charge with sabers against Belgians who were demonstrating and fighting to have the right to vote
The fact that I don't even know anything about that tends to show that Leopold II isn't really known for that particular event, but I humbly accept that I'm not representative for the whole population
Different people have different upbringings and different topics in history classes I guess
Belgium does admit what happened and it's a required part of the school curriculum
I've left school for quite a while now, and I remember Leopold II's rule being covered extensively
We must've spent months on it
It's not generally something that's brought up in conversation, but when it has it seems like this has been the experience of people in "my bubble" as well
I don't think a lot of people learn about it on the Internet, although maybe younger people do these days as they have Internet access before they get to middle school and are taught about it
Well, I saw a few lessons about him in class last year and the only thing we saw was that he got a private colony, slaughtered millions of people and mutilated many more for some riches, and that he had to give up his colony to the belgian state
We did also see that it didn't go a lot better after that
People were still being mistreated and murdered, but now the state was at least building some infrastructure
So no, he isn't being taught as the Builder King anymore
Most Belgians don't know anything about Leopold II being a 'builder' king either
To most people he's just known for Congo Freestate
That's it
The Belgian state isn't willing to apologise to the Congolese government as long as it's not democratic
It considers the Congolese government to be a "coloniser" as well, and instead pays them a lot of foreign aid tied into democratic reforms
We live in a ceremonial monarchy
They won't make statements about what another monarch did in the 19th century
And in general monarchy and higher class in Belgium doesn't share the view that's mostly carried by foreigners on reddit
Good
I graduated high school in 2011, I'm glad this is how you get it taught now
Because amongst Belgians there are two groups of people:
Belgians who think what the king did was disgusting, but don't really think it's a relevant issue today
No one will vote to get those statues removed
A very small number of Belgians who support the king, either because they're racist, either because they're blind towards the bad parts of the royal family
They _will_ vote against any politician which gets rid of the statues
So politically, it's a stupid move to remove the statues
It can only cost you your job
Politicians which are that principled don't get elected as they don't care about electoral gains
There's a massive one of him here in Brussels and I walked by it the other day and someone dumped a massive bucket of paint on his head
It was beautiful
Well, that's actually a good question, and I can only guess
Some of the statued are vandalised and people are juridically asking to take down others
Most aren't happy about them, but I suppose not a lot of people are really angry about it
We just don't view him as that bad
I think another reason is because it was longer ago, there are still people alive now who remember the regime of Hitler
But if you take into consideration that in the USA, confederalist statues are also taken down, then I don't know what to say
It's as if we don't care, not many people are even aware of congo and nobody cares
If the world started to acknowledge everything they did in the colonies and concentrations camps then it'd be endless, nobody is clean and we shouldn't care for things that were made by people already dead
We shouldn't give importance to things that are awful because that's how u got the neo-nazis and all of the fascination around this "culture".
Ignore it and it's going to fade away eventually
pretty sure it's up to the teacher/school, graduated in 2006 myself and our teacher dedicated almost a full semester on Congo & Leopold II
Yeah ours didn't, it got glossed over almost
The fact he was evil is a mandatory part of the school curriculum
My gay ass would have a problem
I’m a girl so my life probably wouldn’t have been the best
I would've been a dead baby or died not too long after that due to chronic illnesses
Hooray for medical science
Oh god I'd be a guy
considering I would have been born in 1797, probably dead or not even born
Otherwise, hailing our new overlords :(
Santa is not a huge thing here, so allow me to explain where Sinterklaas lives
Sinterklaas is based on the Holy Saint Nicholas, a Saint from Myra in Turkey
His shrine and relics can be found in Bari, Italy
Sinterklaas totally disregards that and lives in a castle in Spain
Each year he comes down to the Netherlands and Belgium to deliver presents to the children who have been good on 5 and 6 december respectively
As a Polish Belgian I grew up with Sinterklaas (6 of December) who’s from Spain, with the „gwiazdka” or Star on Christmas whilst also always hearing about Santa Claus (Kerstman)
All of them gave presents
To this day I’m confused
Edit: Kerstman I always thought came from the North Pole
the north pole ofc, alternatively Saint Nicholas lives in Spain
Wait, wasn't it Turkey
I've always been told the song is wrong on that one
Here Sinterklaas comes from Spain, but santa from the northpole
But now he lives in heaven
You can send him a letter using the address Spain Street 1, 0612 Heaven, and you will get something back from the post
I've always heard santa comes from Lapland
> Here Sinterklaas comes from Spain
In Flanders, in Wallonia, he hasn't any precise origin/place of living
Oh damn, I had no idea
Interesting
You say not precise, is it never mentioned or is there like a whole list of possibilities
Do people actually have a kerstman in the Netherlands
I've never known of a family that does that here in Belgium
People bring gifts to each other, no santa involved
We already have Sinterklaas anyway
> Not all Germans are beer experts
More like, no German is a beer expert
If you want good beer, that's in Belgium you go, German beer is so light and standardised it is more akin to lemonade from grown up, or flavoured water
Honestly, you should always wear it, it is much nicer than modern clothes
But there is a real Mount Olympus in Greece
In fact it's the highest mountain in the country
Honestly I'd have to admit I probably assumed that Turkey had a dessert too
I think as someone from a small country, it's difficult to understand countries with so much landmass, what do you do with it
(I guess you just have more people to fill it with
Eventhough Turkey might not even be in the top 10 biggest countries in the world, it looks pretty big to me on a map and my mind just can't wrap around it
I always assume countries that are huge must have some completely empty barren wasteland
And honestly many huge countries do have deserts: China, Australia, Russia, US, Brazil, Kazakhstan, etc
So yes it's just my tiny country brain that can't handle the idea of big countries without chucking half of it away as unimportant empty space
Same issue over here
Loads of websites offer French and English only, no Dutch/Flemish
Microsoft f.e.
What
Microsoft is in Dutch
I sell swimming pools and have costumers that can't open an attachment
Should've been more specific
Xbox store was a disaster and still is sometimes or the achievements etc
The Lego website is finally available in Flemish/Dutch after years of only French and English
It's gambling basically
Verkleinwoorden for example:
Huis = House
Huisje = Little house
Doofpotoperatie
It's a perfect word but also impossible to translate
Same in Dutch
Everything to put on a sandwich is beleg to me
In english infinitives it's basically "to"
I dont want *to* do it
“Ik heb geen zin het te doen” Sounds off to me
"Mijn lief"? Or doesn't that fit
Or maybe it's a typical Belgian word
Hmm
about [all houses]
Bot European but you should see the tunnel built in Colombia
In Antwerp, near the harbor we had a beautiful building from the Renaissance
Some dickhead architect decided that it was a good idea to build a large mirrored glass boat on top of it
It is hideous
If you are interested google "havenhuis Antwerpen"
[Havenhuis]
They put a glass boat on top of the port authority building
That's how 100% of our coast looks
No, no, they are really nice
You do get some mismatches like here but it's overall really nice
A better pick would be something like the [Imec-Tower] which faced multiple design problems, generally looks ugly and kinda [ruined the view] at the nearby Arenberg Castle
I love this page
Definitely because there's a few houses in the list that I actually like
Like if [this] ([different angle] had a really nice luscious garden around it and some ivy on the building itself, it would look great
I also actually like [this one] it looks so majestic, though some more green in the front garden wouldn't hurt
Except for the roof part on the left and again the lack of a fitting garden, I quite like  [this one] too
[This] looks weird, but I can appreciate it
I  appreciate the slightly weird ones, if you want to feel like you live in the [Efteling] why not
Was gonna say this
it does help navigation though
You go to a different country and ALL HOUSES LOOK THE SAME
Can't say we're not original
Compared to some other things I've seen o  this comment section most of those aren't that bad
Also called "The North Sea Wall"
One or 2 rows of high rises next to the beach, for 60km
But it can become annoying too, when like a quarter of your country consists of residential neighbourhoods with 1001 different architectural styles
All divided by a little garden and a fence, with about 5 meters between each house
Some people like it, some people don't. I think it would be cool on it's on own, not with the building underneath
And i didn't know the date to be honest, it just looked renaissancey to me
>FLNC
What is that
I see nothing wrong with a good castle here and there
I'm going to be a minority I imagine but I got 2 hours of religion every week and I loved it
Not religious, would even consider myself anti-religion
It boggles my mind how thinking adults can believe in that stuff
But
Just like history I find it important to know the basics of the major religions
Especially when discussing this topic with Americans it's incredible how ignorant they are on some of the main aspect of the most popular religions
And no, going to church doesn't solve that
Incredible how little church goers often learn
For us religion also included things like dealing with loss, relationships, environment, moral questions, etc
Of course the topic was RELIGION
Not a particular religion
But religion in general
We have catholic schools and state schools
In the catholic schools, everyone gets 2 hours of religion class every week
In state schools, I'm pretty sure everyone gets some sort of 'ethics' class
I just graduated a couple months ago from a catholic high school and I honestly don't get why so many people are against it
As an atheist, NO ONE forces you to be religious
That may have been the case 30 years ago, but times have changed
We just learned about the differences between religions, their history and some ethic and moral stuff
Also, the catholic schools are simply better
It's the case in my city and I've heard this from people all over the country
In state schools, they often just teach you the bare minimum that's required by law
The catholic school for some reason are just from a higher level
They teach more and it's often harder
I know so many people that had bad grades in a catholic school, so they went to a state school, studied the exact same thing and were easily with the best of the class
It seems like only people who have never been to a catholic school are against it
They used to force you to be religious, but that hasn't been the case for decades
They do
But it's different in state schools and catholic schools
State schools have to provide a religion class for all the in Belgium recognized religions of which they have students (most often this is either Christianity or Islam)
For atheist/agnostic students, there is an ethics class
Catholic schools only have to offer "religion". Contrary to what you might think, this is not religious indoctrination
In secondary school, it's more information about all the religions of the world and the most important tenets of their faith
We also had some moral/ethical stuff on different ways of looking at abortion, the holocaust
Never any indoctrination, just a brief "these are some models you can use to form your opinion on it"
I'm a teacher at an elementary school
Our kids can decide what class to attend: catholic, orthodox, ethics, islam
Our school is in Molenbeek (Brussels)
So 99% follows Islam
This is not the same for every school in our country
We have public schools and catholic schools
Every school has different 'rules' about teaching religion
Wow, it sounds so
fascist-like, or like a Christian version of islamism
Why are Cypriots so fanatic/fundamentalist/integrist
I was in GO (community education) where everything was available, atheism, Christianity , Islam, Judaism, ... . If there was even one student of a certain religion then the school would look for a teacher for that one student
yeah, one of the first thing my religion teacher did was showing the stats on who believed in god vs who claimed to be religious vs who prays vs who attend mass/religious gathering
Just some basic math showed that their had to be quite a lot of christian that were non believer and non practicians
Everything shown to us was always,
Christianity does A.
Islam does B.
Judaism does C.
Hinduism does D.
Buddhism does E.
How to burry, how to marry, the "coming of age" thing
We covered different creation myths and such as well
And a lot of ethics stuff
10 places ahead of the US in high school education in 2020
(16 vs 26)
Mind you, that's not exactly seen as an achievement
The US is ahead of Hungary and behind Slovenia
That was quite heart-breaking
Still heart-breaking though
I'm a bit sensitive for stories about people that have the best intentions and get mowed down by either life or other people
There is no other option, any other city would make the opposite side of the country mad
It would completely destabilize Belgium
Well, if Belgium would split up (i hope not), it would probably be Antwerp and Namur, dont you think
Luxembourg ?
Clermont-Ferrand is cool, it has free wifi
Still not an option
Eupen is still in Wallonia, with (afaik) everyone being bilingual (French/german) there, with not much affection for Flanders
The Flemish (still being the majority of the population) wouldn't accept this
Also Eupen is very far even from Brussels and too small
Anything but Antwerp
It's not a good idea to have the political capital in the same city as the economically most important city
Also, the people living there would explode from perceived self-importance
Eupen maybe
Culture is dynamic, it could handle a bit of French influx
I live in Antwerp, and i'm sad to say people already do that
They would probably choke on their fat necks lol
But we already are just so awesome
Maybe the Netherlands should join Flanders
Oh yeah I forgot
Why isnt it our capital yet
Berlin used to be in the centre though
Like I said
I think having the political and economic capital in the same place is for the worse
There’s a higher risk the capital forgets about the rest of the country
Paris and London are way too dominant in their respective countries, drawing too much investments and resources to the detriment of other regions
Berlin isn’t, but that’s a fluke of history
There’s also an internal reason: Antwerp would become unbearable
They already look down on the rest of Flanders, we’d never hear the end of how important they are for the country
And we make Blankenberge the capital
We have the de facto capital and the second (or third, depending on how you measure it) busiest container port and we're the 8th largest economy in the EU
I think we're pretty important for such a small country
One of the founding members and housing almost all of its institutions
You tell me
Ikr
The Netherlands is far ahead of Poland and Poland is only slightly ahead of Sweden and Belgium
Would you consider Malta an English speaking country
When I went I was surprised to see/hear the native language that much
Yes, there are downsides like people abusing the system or leeching from it
But the downsides are nothing compared to the upsides
Downside would be that more people have access to it so you have to share the material resources with them
It's not free but paid for with taxes or similar contributions
That being said it is cheaper because the prices for medicine are negotiated with manufacturers to a low price
Do you mean apart from the questions from those living in one of these few countries where falling seriously ill means you either die or go bankrupt ?
It still amazes me that some people still think the alternative of a "for-profit" healthcare like in (for example) the US is "free healthcare".
When is Joe Sixpack going to accept that the system in his country is all about "making profit", whereas the system in most other places is about "making people better".
There is no such thing as free healthcare, and there never has been or will be
Doctors, nurses, support staff
get a salary
Most of the nurses (male and female) and support staff work hard for relatively low pay
Most doctors, however
Waiting times for treatment depend on whether there is a need for immediate intervention or not
This has --at least in my situation-- always been the case
No need ? Well
you wait
It has occurred I had to wait three months to see a specialist
But there has been a situation where "You need treatment that better is not postponed
Is right now OK with you ?"
And yes, this healthcare system is partly funded by taxes
And yes, some pay more in taxes than they get out of it in services
No big deal
It's called "solidarity". That is a word you may have to look up in a dictionary
Some get more out in services than they contribute
We don't call these people "leeches". These people are in need, and we all support the system that --hopefully-- can help them get better
I don't need doctors to treat me like I'm buying a car when I'm in the hospital
That would scare me lmao
you do have large areas with no hospitals nearby from what i've heard, the so-called medical deserts
You can get monthly paychecks if you are considered disabled or too sick to work
There are people that aren’t sick or disabled, but somehow get all the right documents signed to receive paychecks
The subject here would be that paying them would change that fact
Let's assume doctors are usually just neutral, they don't have anything to gain by being an asshole, it worsens their reputation
Why would you want to pay them money to be kind to you
Isn't it better if they are kind to you for reasons which aren't connected to monetary gain
Gone bad
In our household eggs never go in the refrigerator
They stay good for days
Don't worry
The French counting system makes sense, it's just French people who messed it up with their weird-ass 70 and 90
70 = septante
90 = nonante
It's that simple
French people are just wrong
BELGICA FOREVER
Also, as someone who's learning Dutch, I have to say Dutch makes no sense
Anything I think I understand is wrong
I think you mean French from France
As a Dutch, you should be familiar with Belgian French, where the only weird number is 80
Greek it is not the hardest language in the world but it sounds odd
Germans, I like you and my online gaming buddy is a German and an awesome dude but whyyyyyyyy all this der die das dem den des business
WHY
Dutch learner here
I still don't understand if the computer is sitting or lying or standing on the table, and why it's any of those things instead of just being on the table
I had classes of Turkish for two years at university
The language in itself is very regular, but its logic is very different
So, wouldn't say it doesn't make sense, just that it makes a different type of sense that takes awhile to be accustomed to
Turkish is a Central Asian/Altaïc language though, most Europeans don't consider it European, since its presence in Europe is the fruit of imperialist/colonialist invasions from the Ottoman empire
> Also they’ll still look down on you because you’re not actually French
Well, then practice French with Belgians or Swiss people, French isn't limited to France
French grammar isn't much different from English grammar, what do you find so complicated about it
But
It makes no sense
But thanks for trying
\^-^
I could held a basic conversation in the past, but I lost nearly everything since I haven't practiced it outside of the classes
And my classes were 5 years ago
Still glad I followed some courses though, it is an interesting and rather nice language
I would disagree with that on one point
Italy has, the most interesting /crazy history in the world
Whether you look at pre-Roman times, Roman times (especially the non-stop civil wars followed by mad emperors), post-Western-Roman invasions, the catholic medieval mess of Italic wars, the renaissance, or anything around the Napoleonic or World wars, Italy has something stupid, weird and or hilarious for any time period you could ask about starting with the Etruscans pretty much
I'm not a historian, but I know of no countries history that's as unstable as Italian history
There's a few good contenders, like China, or the mesopotamian region for example (not sure which country to assign that mess to, first guess would be Iran), but by and large, none are as out there as Italian peninsula's history, far as I can tell
Same for me
I barely even knew it was a thing but purely through references my boyfriend makes I've learned a lot already since I met him
Weirdly enough I learned more about it then about our own Belgian Revolution
Although tbf, there isn't much to talk about with our revolution
Not sure if this is sarcastic or not, but yes, we had one to gain independence from the Dutch
In Belgium, have been to a few:
-	School courses take 50 minutes each, but sometimes can take up two slots for 100 minute total
When that’s the case, there is usually a 5-minute break in the middle
-	There are usually 7 courses in a day on Monday-Tuesday-Thursday-Friday, with sometimes 8 courses in later years
Wednesday always has 4 courses, and so ends at midday
-	Exact times and durations differ from school to school, but in the ballpark:
-	2 hours of courses, then a 10-15 min break outside (same for elementary as for high school), then 2 courses, then 50 minute lunch (25 min eating, 25 min break outside), then 2 courses, then a 10-15 break outside, and then 1 last course
-	School starts around 08:30, and ends around 15:30, give or take 20 minutes depending on when you started and how long your breaks were
On Wednesday, school ends at around 12:00
-	In every school I’ve been to, there were 2 hours of Phys
per week
When the school had their own sports hall, people went to that room
When the school didn’t have their own sports hall, students walked to the nearby public sports hall or were driven there by a rented bus, depending on the distance
-	In elementary school, students stayed in the same classroom while teachers left and returned
You had mostly 1 teacher for most courses (reading, spelling, art, world orientation (a mix between history, geography and biology)), you might still have another teacher for a select few courses (maths, phys
, religion, ...)
-	In high school, same thing
Students didn’t swap rooms except for a select few courses, though there were more courses with specially assigned rooms
You do your chemistry in the chemistry lab, you do your music education in the room with the piano, etc
-	There is no formal equivalent to middle school, though in informal context it refers to the first two years of high school
-	At university, it’s a bit more YOLO and chaotic
You’d get an agenda like [this] Courses take about 60 minutes here, and swapping rooms is very common for students
-	It’s never fun to wait an hour between two courses, so the university tries to match the lesson plans each year so it’s students get the fewest amount of “skip-hours” possible
-	When you fail a course in university, you might want to redo it the next year and take the follow-up courses of the courses you succeeded at
But of course, some courses will overlap and there will be problems
You can discuss those at the student administration
The only way to never have courses overlap is to succeed at each course always
-	Unlike elementary and high, when you fail your exams at university at the end if May or June, you get a “second seat,” you can retake your failed exams at the end of August or the start of September
That gives you plenty of time to study, and no summer holiday
Or combine both and cut in your studying time
Up to you, you’re an adult now
-	Anyone is eligible to enter university, as long as they finished high school
This is in contrast to Germany, where only people from Gymnasium are eligible, afaik
No need to send letters, you just go to the student administration and join at the start of September
Studying costs about 1000 euro per year, not including rent or food; depending on the amount of courses
It can get cheaper if you have a low income
-	Some courses, such as when studying to become a doctor or a lawyer, may have entrance exams
In those, only the best xx students may follow the course
If you’re studying IT or business, no such entrance exams exist
-	Lastly, fun fact
“Blijf in uw kot” is the Flemish slogan for the Coronavirus “Stay at home”. *”Blijf in uw”* means *”Stay at your”* but *kot* is the Flemish informal word for *student housing
* Even so, it’s a fun word to say
*Kot, kot, kot
* and everyone knows what’s meant by this in Covid-19 context
It's different in Flanders and Wallonia (I'm in Flanders) and times can differ from school to school, but for me:
\- School started at 8:25
\- Period 1: 8:25-9:15 (all periods are 50 minutes)
\- Period 2: 9:15-10:05
\- 20 minute break
\- Period 3: 10:25-11:15
\- Period 4: 11:15-12-05
\- Lunch break: 12:05-13:30 (so almost 90 minutes)
\- Period 5: 13:30-14:20
\- Period 6: 14:20-15:10
\- Period 7: 15:10-16:00
Most schools have a shorter lunch break and have a break between the 6th and 7th period, but mine decided to be different
Also: on Wednesdays we only had school until 12:00, so we only had 4 periods then
The break at 10am was also 5 minutes shorter then so we could leave at 12:00 (no idea why they didn't just end it at 12:05)
I wake up around 7:20
My school starts at 8:30
Lessons are 50 minutes each
We have 2 lessons from 8:30-10:10
Then a 15 minute break
Then 2 lessons from 10:25-12:05
Then we had a break to eat and play some games untill 13:05
Then 2 lessons from 13:05-14:45
Then a 10 minute break and then 1 lesson from 14:55-15:45
This is on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday
On Wednesday, we only have 4 lessons
It's basically the same except we only get a 10 minute break instead of a 15 minute one, so school ends at 12:00
For me it's like this
* 6:30: wake up
* 7:15: catch the bus
* 8:05 arrive at school
* 8:30 school starts
* 8:30-11:00 three classes of 50 minutes each
* 11:00-11:15 break to pee (or in my case work in the shop on Monday)
* 11:15-12:55 two more classes of 50 minutes
* 12:55-13:55 one hour break
* 13:55-15:35 two more 50 minute classes
* 15:35 go home
* ??:?? take the bus
* ??+2:?? get home
(alright that last bit is exaggerated but fuck the busses)
But most schools have a structure that's more like
* Two times 50 minutes class
* 15 minute break
* Two times 50 minutes class
* Lunch break
* Three times 50 minutes class (possibly with a break)
I can +1 this, except for the entrance exam to study law
That is not a thing in Flanders
It wasn't when I started law school 4 years ago and it wasn't a thing this year either AFAIK
Your university courses only last 60 minutes each
Mine vary from 3h up to 4,5h each
It truly feels like hell sometimes
>In high school, same thing
Students didn’t swap rooms except for a select few courses, though there were more courses with specially assigned rooms
You do your chemistry in the chemistry lab, you do your music education in the room with the piano, etc
In my school, we switch rooms for every course
A lot of teachers have their own room
>School courses take 50 minutes each, but sometimes can take up two slots for 100 minute total
When that’s the case, there is usually a 5-minute break in the middle
I've never had such breaks
Also, even 4 hours (200 minutes) of a certain course was possible
There was only the normal 10-15 minute break after 2 hours, although teachers sometimes gave us an informal break of 5 minutes (where we weren't allowed to leave the classroom)
Ah, then I was confused
I'm not going to edit my post, otherwise your post wouldn't make sense anymore
Thanks for the correction though
In my reference point: Multiple course slots exists, sure, just like in elementary/high, but even then there would be a 5-10 minute break each hour
You'd usually just stay in class during that time though
Refresh your brain a bit
Huh
Depends on school then I guess
>although teachers sometimes gave us an informal break of 5 minutes (where we weren't allowed to leave the classroom)
That's the kind of break I was talking about
Sorry for making it not clear enough
In my experience, that happens more often than not, and can be discussed in that way when generalizing the Belgian school system for the internet
Only time it didn't happen was when students were behind on the curriculum and every minute of the course mattered
Yeah I didn't people *don't* switch rooms in other schools
Students occupied a castle to insist on lowering beer prices
Did the advisor get away with it ?
Could you explain the second one
First one is
Interesting
I must say I'm unable to give you an answer to that question
Can't find it reported anywhere so far
Also some say it had actually been organised more as an enormous prank out of boredom rather than for some good reasons like the beer price that would be raised from 3 to 4 franks
De oude stede
Yep, in Gent natuurlijk
[Wallon Buiten ?]
Especially for the Flemish part of Belgium, I would say the first Sunday of April
That day the Tour of Flanders is held
Everyone is either watching the race on TV or is somewhere along the parcours
Good answer
I was focussing so hard on the different national holidays, but not one of them would have everyone in the best of moods lol
This is probably closest to that :p
Here in Brussels it's probably Carless Sunday
Cars are banned from the city and everybody comes out to cycle, inline skate or just walk
There are stands all over the city where you eat, party, give your bike a check-up, or just socialize
24th and the 25th of December
In the Netherlands they celebrate the 26th as well
24th evening and 25th day are both celebrated but it depends on the family
Some celebrate the 24th, some the 25th
I don't think Italy has been united on religion since the Roman empire somewhere :p.
We have a lot of diversity here, a lot of Belgians with all different skin tones
They are all Belgian to me, and taking a normal picture of a white Flemming, would be like taking a white person in America and saying this is the average American, u can't just spot people from your country any more, unless ur country has a big lack of diversity, or u can narrow the group down to Flemmings, Walloons, Belgians with half mixed heritage, full mixed heritage, and so on
Then I could probably guess
Dirk Kuijt is the ultimate Hollander for me
Dirk Kuijt is so Dutch looking to me
Belgium and The Netherlands are so similar but you can still tell that this is a dutch person and not Flemish, he is indeed the most Dutch looking man ever
In Belgium, Brussels and Bruges for sure
There's always plenty of tourists in Brussels, but I still feel it's an extremely underrated city (Belgium's an underrated place to visit as whole IMO)
Every year we have hordes of our Spanish brothers and sisters who come to visit Bruges
I always wondered who that city became so popular in Spain
Probably bruges or brussels
Anyway just the big historical cities
The north see coast, especially La Panne since it's so close to France and maby the Ardenne !
Yeah, and Ghent also gets quite some tourists
The historic centers of the three cities are often so crowded
As for Antwerp, I don't know, since I've actually never been there, and I'm not planning on going anytime soon, with Covid raging over there
Also, we get a lot of German and domestic tourists on our coastline
On a nice day the beaches get packed
Antwerp is quite touristy as well, especially the Groenplaats and de Grote Markt
You really should go once things are better
It’s really a beautiful city (well not all of it haha)
You never have been in antwerp, are you from wallonia
Nope
But Antwerp is kinda far for me anyway, being from Southern East-Flanders
Bergen is closer than Antwerpen, to me
I am from south west-flanders and if you want to see a big comedian or music group it is brussel or antwerpen
Saying it like that “it’s a state in the US” sounds very condescending to me tbh
Also I think everyone would know the names of the states just not where they were located exactly
If you are concerned about it, just say “I’m from the US” and if they want to know the state they will ask
To recite them all
If you say the name, will we know it is a state
Probably
How well do we know the state you name
Really depends on how famous the state is
Don't ask us for their capitols though
I cant really speak for other Europeans,  but I can name most of the states
I can only locate like half of them tho
We’ll know the names I think
Apart from that we’ll also know where the big ones are and pretty mich everybody knows where last election’s crucial states are
So putting Minnesota on a map for might be hard for some, but everybody knows where Pennsylvania is
I think I recognize all 50 as a state and with few exceptions I know more or less where they are(not exactly but I know if it's in the North, South, etc
Although minnesota would be one of the lesser known, a lot of people know most of the states (not where they are on a map though)
I also think minnesota would be known because of big time rush (children's program)
Cultural hegemony over European media is mostly why lots of Europeans are familiar with the names of the states, and they even keep up with US current affairs
Well, more like if you say the name they will know it is a state
If you give them a test and ask them to write down all US states, then no
Yo, I am from the région bruxelloise, it's in Belgium
But I'm originally from Vlaams Brabant, it's also in Belgium
Sounds like a funny way to introduce ourselves by province
Good comparison honestly
"Slovenia" or "Bulgaria" you might not know where it is but most will know it's somewhere in Europe
They even took a city name from Belgium (Hoboken) :)
Exactly :) that’s what I meant
Well, there is the difference in language so it's mostly an easy giveaway
Austin is well known from western movies like Jango Unchained, I think
That's why I know it's in Texas at least
In Belgium you can localise someone quite precisely based on his accent
Damn, the State Capital if New York has less inhabitants than Bruges
It's hard to say, the type of difficulties varies
My mother tongue is French
I have learnt, in school or university, these languages : Dutch, English, Spanish, Russian, Latin, Icelandic and Turkish
And by myself, a bit of Swedish and German
But I didn't continue
For me, my top 3 hardest are these, for different reasons :
* ***Russian*** : because of its pronunciation and its rather complex conjugation and verbs
As a whole it is not easy
I could get around the declensions and cases, since I studied Latin for 6 years in secondary school, so, I was accustomed to the logic
* **Turkish** : while Turkish has a very regular grammar, barely no exceptions, and follows a clear logic, it is a very different logic from Indo-European languages
It is agglutinative, meaning it works by adding suffixes to radicals
What would be one sentence in an European language can simply be one long "word" in Turkish
It asks you to think your sentences totally differently from how you think in Indo-European languages, you don't build your ideas the same way with an agglutinative language
That's an harder switch of thoughts than having to use grammar declensions in my opinion
* It will sound surprising, but **Dutch** : here, not because it is objectively hard or not, I suppose, that after having learnt some other languages it should be a rather easy language
But for two reasons : like most French-speakers and Romance-languages-speakers, I find this language to be particularly ugly (Netherlands' Dutch) or ridiculous/funny-sounding (Belgian Dutch)
It really makes it hard to be interested and devoted in/to it, when you don't find a redeeming quality in how the language sounds
I should learn it, I want to learn it, but it is so unattractive from the aesthetical standards of the perspective of Romance/Latin languages/cultures
Even if German is technically harder I would have an easier time learning it, since I find it more attractive and potentiallly nice-sounding
And that's why I don't count Icelandic in the hardest ones as well, despite the fact it is actually hard, because I find it nice aesthtetically
I've been trying to learn Welsh, and I think it's pretty rough
I started learning Italian once, and that was quite easy, but I didn't have time to continue
German is so hard
Danish
Like what the actual fuck did you guys do with your pronunciation
What's up with that
Why does everyone talk like their mouth is on fire and their brain is simultaneously frozen
Why is the same letter a different sound every fucking time
And this comes from a guy who knows way too many languages (thanks Flemish schools, among others)
From those I want to learn, Russian
Spanish, German and English were way easier because they're Romance and Germanic languages and Im familiar with those since my two mother languages are Romance and Germanic
Russian is beautiful, but totally different
Bulgarian is hard af to learn
Hard language and lack of study materials
If you like a lot of grammer rules
You should really try dutch it has a lot of grammer rules and exceptions
In belgium, you're supposed to learn three languages in school (more can be chosen, but I had a maths extra)
I did try to learn korean, and that's a bitch to learn
Japanese is the samen
The hardest ones for me are tonal languages like Chinese Vietnamese and Thai because even trying to remember the difference between basic words is so hard
Languages like Hungarian may have hard grammar rules but at least i can learn enough to understand what they are saying in a relatively short time even if i don't know how the speak correctly
Govoriti li Srbija
[ja ä bök]
Wait you find German nicer sounding than nice old Flemish
You mock your fellow countrymen
I feel so offended
You really are Belgian
Not that you should talk, wtf is up with Walloon French
Oké matjen, here we go
Ge pakt de stam van uw werkwoord, das basically het werkwoord zonder de -en
Dat gebruikt ge achter "ik" en voor "je". Na "je" of u of hij of zij of zo plakt ge der een t aan, tenzij er al een 't staat
There is no desire to offend anyone
I find Belgian Dutch to be better than the Dutch from the Netherlands at least, some accents are nearly nice
The one from the Netherlands though is the ugliest thing I have ever heard
Depending the accent, German can sound nice, while I have never heard nice-sounding Dutch (sounds like the Dutchies are always trying to clear their throat, that's so guttural ; their hard g' and j' are just the sound of hell)
That's just Romance aesthetical standards talking
All these "art", "oert", "oen", "ijn", "ij", "uin", "org", "oet", "ijk", "oeg", "eert" and others sounds I could mention are just funny/ridiculous sounding to us
I mean, look at all these ridiculous names I'll list below, they sound like the names you would give to dwarves, goblins and gnomes in fantasy
I have selected all the ones that sound funny based on beauty/aesthetical standards in Romance languages :
**For males :**
Gert, Bart, Baaf, Bert, Borg, Brett, Crabbe, Daaf, Dok, Druyt, Faas, Fiek, Flupke, Freek, Goos, Haas, Hacke, Hoeke/Hoefke, Huf, Jaap, Jef, Jejoen, Jokke, Jurjen, Kees, Klaas, Koert, Kuppe, Lebbeke, Leek, Lippe, Maas/Maes, Merck, Naard, Nap, Neef, Nolle, Otte, Pien, Pinxt, Pulle, Raafke, Raan, Raf, Roelof, Rubbe, Rutte, Ruud, Scholte, Sepp/e, Sjaak, Sjoerd, Smeek, Soet, Stoffel, Taal, Teun, Thoke, Tis, Tjip, Treun, Tuur, Tuyp, Viel
**For females :**
Aagt, Aaltje, Ant, Barb, Barbel, Berta/Bertha, Bertine, Bertje, Bet, Betje, Bieke, Brechtje, Bregje, Daatje, Doortje, Drika, Eef, Eefje, Elke, Feme, Femke, Floorke, Floortje, Frieke, Geertje, Geertrui, Geike, Gertie, Giene, Gientje, Goele, Gon, Gonde, Greet, Greetje, Greta, Grete, Griet, Grietje, Guus, Guusta, Heike, Henneke, Hildeke, Ingeborg, Jans, Jemke, Jet, Jetje, Jikke, Jomar, Jorunn, Josje, Joske, Kato, Keetje, Koba, Kole, Koos, Kruis, Liek/e, Lorna, Lot, Lotje, Lotte, Lutgarde, Maaike, Machteld, Marke, Miek/e, Mirte, Neeltje, Nelletje, Net, Noortje, Piet, Pieternel, Reeke, Renske, Riet, Saartje, Sosse, Steetje, Thoke, Toreke, Toreken, Trees, Trijntje, Trinette, Trui, Truida, Truide, Uge, Ulrika, Ursula, Veerle, Viefke, Virge, Vroon, Wantje, Wiebke, Wiske
I mean, are they for real
Who would call his/her child Vroon, Trui, Barb, Bertje, Gert, Baaf, Borg, Fiek, Scholte, Sjoerd or Jaap
What were they thinking
I was exaggerating my offence for the joke of the flemish and the Walloon constantly bitching around, not to worry
Those names truly are ridiculous, some of them sound quite normal and are names I've heard a lot, but most are utter garbage
It can also be stunning, jawdropping, exuberant (that might be a bit of a stretch), fantastic, wonderful, splendid,... I will agree that there are less words with subtle nuances of "good" than other languages have
And if there are, few people use them
I got it, but well, I just wanted to share a perspective
I want to precise though that besides my unfortunate "no-liking" of the language, once I'll have an earning and schedule (searching for a job, just finished university), I plan to take lessons of Dutch again, even if I might not need it, because I do think Francophones should learn it
I really think we should see more Flemish movies and TV shows on our TV and in our cinemas (because for now, there is none on french-speaking channels and cinemas
) and hear Flemish songs on our radios
If we were exposed to Dutch/Flemish since very young, if we heard it much more frequently, if it was part of our environment, I'm sure we would be used to it, and not find it ugly anymore
Because despite the fact I genuinely and unfortunatly don't like the sound of the language, I find it sad, and I'm a bit "angry" at our public medias for not promoting things from Flanders
So, while I know your comment was a joke, I just want to precise that I don't feel disdain for your language
I think this is important, because the Francophone elite of the past showed disdain and disrespect for all non-French languages of Belgium (including Walloon, which was nearly and practically eradicated), that Flemish people suffered from it, and that there are still vile remnants of it among some Francophones
I agree, it's important that both sides learn and practice the languages of the "other side". We have a similar problem with French, no French to be heard anywhere, even our politicians are often dubbed
There is also a lot of French-hate and wallonais-hate here, which I absolutely don't get
It's ridiculous
Fuck yeah
I hope it can grow stronger and more united in 2020 ️
Absolutely
Yes life is good here but i'm not sure about the future of the eu
Glad I live in Europe but disgusted that EU is ruining it
Yes
To be honest, I don't know enough about the matter to precisely say why being in the EU is better than out, but generally speaking, I got the feeling there's more pro's than contra's. Not great, not terrible
Just imagine what we could accomplish if the governments of the EU, Russia and Ukraine would all show goodwill, set aside their differences and worked together to tackle the real world problems
Ah one can only wish
Come together, right now, over me
To give a bit of perspective on that
30 minutes South-West for me is Ghent
30 minutes West is the city of Brugge
1 hour South-West is Brussels
3 hours South is Paris
3 hours North is Amsterdam
etc
etc
If you don’t vote you can get a fine (starting from €30 up to €1000 if I’m not wrong, it depends on which election it is too) in theory, but they rarely actually fine people as far as I know
You don't have to vote, but you have to register at the voting station
They have a list of the people who are domiciled in the voting district and basically just cross out your name when you show up
Very easy to just see who wasn't there this way
In my experience, not showing up to vote barely ever gets fined
However failing to show up when called upon for supervision gets fined pretty much all the time
Yes
It's actually often related to your profession
Government employees, people in law professions or education are more likely to be called as the supervisors of the voting and counting bureaus
If you have been called up once, chance as great you get called up again in later elections because the pool is smaller
Then you have the general population who may be called up as "bijzitter", basically people who get a specific single task on election day (helping out voters with questions, taking names, counting votes)
It's rarer to get called more than once this way, but in smaller voting districts it's definitely possible
You can get a laughable compensation varying between €20-€40
Yeah
People go to great lengths to get out of bijzit duty
We have the pink ballet (roze balletten) which is a conspiracy from the Dutroux age where people believe(d) that there was a network of pédophiles infiltrated in the highest Powers of the nation, organizing outragious sex parties
Another one is the gang of Brabant (Bende van Nijvel) which was a group of gangsters that committed some horrendous robberies on supermarkets with lot's of deadly victims
The conspiracy is that it was a politically motivated attack orchestrated by the national police and right wing parties
The strange thing here is that during the years it became more and more clear that this might actually be true
Our King Albert I didn't die due to a climbing accident, but was shot by a jealous husband of his maîtresse
This has got to be taxes in Belgium
People believe that taxes are payed so the goverment can usenit for building and maintaining a modern transport infrastructure, public services and all
The reality is that all our roads are full with potholes, our trains and busses are always overcrowded and late, our police, firefighters, teachers, doctors are greatly understaffed
Yet we pay the highest taxes in europe ...
And for some reason we all just keep on paying taxes
Apparently Belgium doesn't exist, i don't know anyone who believes that but if you google belgium doesn't exist the first site you come across  is blocked by the belgian ministery of truth
Didn't even know that existed lol
It depends on what you're looking for
Sometimes the Dutch one is more extensive, sometimes the English one is and sometimes the French one is
I just kind of use whichever one is the longest if I want to find something specific
The dutch language wikipedia is quite good actually
It is nice to be able to read other languages (English, French, German, Spanish) so I do sometimes check what wikis in another language have to say on a certain subject
The English version typically has the most information, but other language versions sometimes are more detailed
I usually use English unless it is something that is more local
for some technical stuff (engineering/physics) the explanations can be a lot clearer/more to-the-point in dutch
Not often bit it happens
Also local history is something I always check in both English and dutch
I use them both
Especially for anything related to Belgium or the Netherlands, the Dutch Wikipedia can be a lot more extensive than the English one
Often there'll be information mentioned in the English one, and not in Dutch one but also vice versa
The Dutch one often is severely lacking in content about Belgium though
Often the pages exclusively talk about the material from a Dutch perspective, not including Belgium at all, or only as a small and often incredibly incomplete and outdated paragraph
I find it convenient to have both
Sometimes the English article is just too detailed and the Dutch one is short and to the point
I've seen many articles about very specific stuff (even about Belgium) that doesn't have an English or Spanish article, but that does have a Catalan article
Unless you are 14 or something, I am impressed by your ignorance
I've had Germans ask about the Belgian language, so it could be worse, I guess
Very common, most people drink tap water, it's good quality
Uncommon, even though our tap water is really good
Yes
Why
Because it's drinkable
That's honestly the only reason I can think of
Where I live (around Ghent) almost everybody I know buys bottles
Everyone in my family and a most people I know drink tap water
Funny, where I live, (around Gent too), almost everybody I know drinks tap water
I don't know anyone who doesn't drink it tbh
Some people see it as something more for "poor" people maybe, but that's kinda elitist bs
Taste is fine for me, but can't really argue but tastes
I'm kind of weary of foreign tap water because I know water quality in Belgium is really good, so when abroad I would drink bottled water to be sure
You drink a lot of blood then
For me it's the opposite
Maybe it's more a local thing
No it is common he tripping
Finding a job in Brussels is almost impossible
I thought my difficulties were due to not speaking French/Dutch at a high enough rate but after consulting multiple natives/expats it seems that it's just a Brussels problem and even trilingual natives also can't find work
There will be no new plots of land after 2050 and in 2030 they will severely cut back on the amount of new plots available
Brussels is very stagnant and undynamic
The entire city feels like one big government quarter, almost entirely dominated by civil servants and Eurocrats
My city is economically stricken, nothing has changed much, a lot of unemployment here
There was to be a shopping center but there is an insoluble conflict between the city and the developer
The site is now a big urban wasteland
Socialists have always been powerful in power for a century due to a mining and steel history but also because they rely on a network of clientelism and on nostalgia for struggles for social gains
I understand a bit the Flemish desires for autonomy for this reason
My country is heavily indebted and spend badly
No one wants to make the necessary reforms due to a very complex state structure and community issues
Politicians have the mentality of being responsible for nothing and always accuse the other
Same in my hometown (Leuven - Belgium)
I met an Irish guy in Brussels who said that it's cheaper to live in Brussels than in Dublin, I really did not expect that
Brussels is not so prosperous economically, a lot of unemployment especially among young people and immigrants
Many HR are Flemish and favor their own communities and those who speak their language perfectly
In addition, the job market in Belgium is very rigid and there is too much socialism there
British people go to Jamaica and also make a fool out of themselves it's so embarrassing to see, I'm so glad I'm not from the touristy areas of the country so I don't have to witness it
similar to here where the gov sold a huge building (might be classified as skyscraper) to only rent it for decades
The longer I live in Brussels the more the nepotism heavy culture is apparent here especially in the EU institutions
I'm moving to Berlin after, if I can't find work it will be surrounded by depravity not the EU
I think Belgium is one of the only countries in the world with the right amout of socialism
I find it really sad so many Flemish people became so selfish and stopped caring about each other
This through our social provisions
Same in Belgium
Even my local supermarket doesn't take visa
Tf, isn't Vancouver like insanely expensive in comparison to other Canadian cities
Honestly wouldn't think Dublin would be worse than Vancouver B.C. (Narduwar voice)
My friends apartment is dead in the city center at 800 for two bedrooms
My one bedroom apartment is Art Deco style not too far from
The Center by public transport and is 740+75 in charges so 815 a month
My apartment is more expensive than average though because I personally wanted an apartment in this style but you can easily find a one bedroom in Brussels for less than that
The apartments here are also of a very high and good quality, I’ve yet to see one really bad one
Yis
Where in the Caribbbean
It's a big place and every country has something different to offer
I can definitely provide some advice about Jamaica though
Jamaica is a great place to live if you:
are not gay
American evangelicals had their way with us as they did many poor and black countries and it has been the worst stain on our culture in my opinion
Avoiding clichés of course, the culture is very laid back and chill
Other than that, if you intend to live (or visit) there and you avoid Kingston you will be fine
Kingston being the capital the violence is largely concentrated there and it's definitely not a place that you would want to expatriate to and I've personally never spent a very substantial amount of time there even
Personally I'm from a very rural area in "Maggoty
" Other areas of the country that are cool are: Mandeville, Clarendon, Hanover, Saint Elizabeth, Trelawny, Westmoreland
In my opinion the Western part of the country is definitely the most beautiful in landscape and also happens to be the safest, it is here where most people live off of the land and mind their business
You can rent a house very cheaply there and live in the mountains lol
I plan to do the same thing at some point even if it's just for a brief amount of time
The food is absolutely amazing and it's what I miss the most living in Europe, the landscapes are beautiful, the people are funny and endearing, and it's a really amazing culture to experience in its entirety
I get annoyed with tourists who visit there because they essentially never experience Jamaican culture in its authenticity because they often spend their entire time in resorts
There's a youtube series that I'm aware of (that I don't necessarily endorse either lol) called Ras' Kitchen that documents the life of a Jamaican rasta and a few episodes features some British/Scottish/European dudes who have moved to Jamaica
They live "in Bush" though lmao which basically means they live a very simple and straight forward life living off the land, but it's not indicative of a life that every Jamaican lives
Since I'm from the country I couldn't give you any indication of what city life in Jamaica is like but I don't think I'd like it anyway
Edit: [This] video gives you a really good idea about what the Jamaican countryside is like and the rasta in it is really funny and is a good representation about how most country rastas are like
Yes, Jamaican landscape is overall largely natural and unexploited
It's a pain in the ass sometimes if you go hiking or fruit picking which is usually why you will see people travel with machete in hand, to hack away the bush
> Is this in an area of the country considered mountainous
The W. part of Jamaica is definitely amongst the most mountainous and has the most naturally beautiful and untouched "nature
" However, it is an Island and there is beauty throughout the country
The Blue Mountains for example can be seen throughout the Northeast/South of the country
Very BEAUTIFUL views and amazing natural scenery as well
> You just introduced me to the concept of "country rastas"
Rastas are a very visual part of the culture
They are stereotyped far too often in the West and a lot of people just know the parts of rastafarianism that are the most shallow (smoking weed, locs, etc)
They are very serious about how they live and most are very spiritual people who live very simple lives and live off the land
Many are vegans and commit to living their lives very naturally
>  From the video I also assume that Jamaicans have no issues understanding other English accents and dialects
Not a problem
Our mother tongue is English but we speak in a dialect called patois
If you don't understand it (which you probably won't lol) every Jamaican can speak without the dialect to just standard English so that you can understand what they say
We won our independence from the British so we also sometimes speak using British colloquialisms as well
> Also, I have absolutely zero points of references for Jamaican food
It's AMAZING
Especially the breadth of the fruit in a tropical country is nothing compared to what is imported to Europe
I read being crazy old, and I had no clue why you were talking about the warmest january
From my experience (french speaker) Paris only has incredibly wonderful people or incredibly rude ones, nothing in between
Yeah the plastic isn't staying in europe, i've learned that we export it mostly to asia and it isn't pretty
It's also January 17th in Belgium
What a coincidence
Yep, the ski resorts have to work a lot to keep the pistes in good health
For those wondering why Brussels isn't even on the list: it's because the city is divided in a dozen different administrative entities
And for those wondering whether that's a good idea: no it's not, it's an absolute mess
Szczecin soudns familiar but I'm not 100% sure, otherwise Brno
For me it was Szczecin in Poland, with 400,990 inhabitants
After that it starts getting fairly common for cities that I've never heard of to appear
Iași, Romania; Bydgoszcz, Poland; Plovdiv, Bulgaria and Constanța, Craiova and Galați in Romania
All the way down
But I'm a geography student, so that might account for something
That list doesn't even have the European capital, Brussels .
Poznan, which incidentally only has a slightly higher population than my city (Antwerp)
Good to know
Brussels only needs to get counted the right way to be top 5 or something, they only count 1/19th of the city for
reasons
To be fair, it's not the German name for the city
It is called Köln
In Dutch we call it 'Keulen' which I think is closer to the German spund than "Cologne".
Yeah but it's only a small part, the other parts aren't suburbs or something, it's just more city
Strange list
Just try to speak it (Dutch here)
You will make mistakes but we will most of the time understand it and will be glad to help you
I find the best way to learn language is to hang out with people who are native speakers
Since I was 10 years old I always had to study French
For 8 years I studied it and I was horrible at it
I spent 6 months in the US on a semester abroad and met some French friends
They taught me more French in that 6 months than my 8 years in school
Some tips when you learn a language in general:
- listen to music in that language and look up the translations in english
- If you have a basic knowledge of the language, read a quality newspaper (for Dutch that would be De Morgen/De Standaard/De Tijd in Belgium)
- listen to the national radio station
There you will hear politicians and famous people talk (Dutch would be radio 1 in Belgium)
Well, step one would definitely be picking one language
How much I loathe them, but a good way to get a grasp of our language is by watching our soaps (Thuis, Familie),  because they use very clear, understandeable Flemish
Other tv shows can be tricky
One the one hand you have shows where the Flemish is very basic (like FC De Kampioenen), but a lot of shows embrace our dialect diversity, which can make it hard or a learner to follow (I'm thinking shows like Van Vlees en Bloed; Eigen Kweek; Matroesjka's to name a few older ones)
Tu spreek keine Belgica
Written press is mostly the same I figure
The moment we all open our mouths tho, that's a different story
As you said: native speakers
But you're right
yeaa for sure, i do feel like a bit of a european, going to france or germany on an easy vacation, netherlands for shopping etc, no border annoyances (usually), no need for money exchange etc
its pretty nice
Belgium:
When you forget to close the door: This isn't a church
In Wallonia it's ''We're not in a church here''
When the food isn't ready, I'd get "shit with beans" as an answer
That would be "do you live in a church" here
Dutch royals are forbidden from having any position of power or public authority in Belgium
So they can't be on the throne, they can't get access to the public sector and they can't participate in elections
**That's in our constitution
Another one: In Leuven, street musicians can be fined for playing off-key
In Hasselt, you can get fined for using a sports field for any other sport than the one it was intended for
You were also not allowed to wear a mask that covers your face (before Covid-19), but exceptions are made for Sinterklaas, Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny
On to national laws: if you get declared bankrupt, the curator cannot take away your last cow, 12 goats or sheep, one pig and 24 chickens, along with the food they require
I love my country
Uhum: WIJ WILLEN WILLEM WEG, WIL WILLEM WIJZER WORDEN, WIJ WILLEN WILLEM WEER
(We want willem(the king of the netherlands) gone, would willem become more wise, we want willem back)
I can't find it either lol
I looked it up and it is said that  it's considered a decree with constitutional status
I can confirm this is true
Oh yeah I forgot about that one
Best revolution ever, way better then ghe french one
No, you can't in Dutch
To give you a few examples: au and ou sound the same, you need to know which it is
So do ei and ij
Most of the time, yes
There are some spelling rules that you need to remember
Loan words are completely a seperate category as they still can have their original spelling
And of course, we have exceptions that you just have to know
"Wraak", "wrat", "erwt",... these are for children some difficult ones to spell
No, not at all (Dutch)
C can be pronounced as K or S, depending on the word
The J in the common name Jef is pronounced as ZJ
Words ending in -tie are pronounced as -tsie
There's also a large amount of loanwords from English and French, with similar problems
We had a russian student in our school, she would open the russian version of google maps and would be able to pronounce every village exactly as we would in dutch
Pretty cool
French consistent with rules
There's not a single rule they don't have exceptions for
Or do you mean pronounciation rules
it was surprising to me that the russian text she read sounded exactly the same as what we would call the village
This is not always the case
Whereas an english speaker would have difficulties pronouncing brugge like brugge and not like Bruges, she would just read the text and it would sound exactly the same as I would say it
When I was a student I had a summer job at a butcher shop
When you had ‘to go’ the code was ‘I have to go see Albert’ or when someone was called for ‘He’s helping out Albert’. So customers wouldn’t get offended
The boss was a staunch republican (not in the US sense) and Albert was the name of the King of Belgium at the time
The smallest room (het kleinste kamertje) in Dutch
My dad always said pissodrôme
He was always the classiest person in a room
I don't think I've ever seen him without a suit
I personally like to go for tongue-twisters:
Hottentottententententoonstelling
De kat krabt de krollen van de trap
Als een potvis in een pispot pist zit de pispot vol met potvispis
De koetsier poetst de postkoets met postkoetspoets
Als kakkerlakken in kattebakken kakken, heb je een kattebak vol met kakkerlakkak
Reminds me of the song:
>Door de kamer vloog een vlieg
>Vliegensvlug vloog daar die vlieg
>’t vliegen van de vlieg was vlug gedaan
,want ze vloog tegen de vliegenvanger aan
>O o o,...
>’t Vliegen van de vlieg was vlug gedaan
want ze vloog tegen de vliegenvanger aan
>Flanders they make it so soft that it's almost a 'h' sound
That's west flemish
The rest of Flanders uses a regular soft g.
Gemakkelijk by a west-fleming sounds like 'hemakkelijk'.
We also say 'dikken' where I'm from but when people from somewhere else hear that, they are confused or insulted lol
I'd like to add "pieke" but AFAIK that's only used in the region around Sint-Truiden
We need Krampus
The only solution
We needed a king and just got a royal from somewhere else
'Never be king in your country
Come to Belgium, we have the opportunity for you
All you have to do is send us your credit card information
In 1989 a soviet mig pilot ejected from his plane in Poland due to an issue with the afterburner
The plane kept on flying on autopilot until it finally crashed on a solitary house in the rural kooigem in Belgium
Killing an 18 year old boy who just finished his final exams and who wanted to sleep in while his brother and parents went shopping
The diplomatic consequences where minimal because it became clear the cold war was running on it's end
To commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle at Waterloo, Belgium wanted to mint a special 2 euro coin
Because the battle at Waterloo is a sensitive subject for a lot of French, they vetoed it in the Council of the European Union
Instead, Belgium decided to mint a 2,5 euro coin to commemorate it, because that doesn't require approval by the Council
Jeez, good thing royals these days aren't being married to each other anymore as a rule, what a bunch of unoriginal people we were
I went on an Erasmus exchange last year and lived abroad for about 4 months, so I feel like I can answer this question
So I applied for Erasmus with my home university, I was accepted and they sent a message to the receiving university (in Bordeaux) that I was coming over, so to please let me attend classes
Other than that, I was on my own to get enrolled there and find accomodation
So I went through the motions of applying for student housing (Bordeaux actually has a bit of a problem with that but I was able to get it through the university)
They were being a bit bitchy about the required documents because I needed some documents that were specific to French citizens and they didn't accept the Belgian equivalent ones I sent over (despite being in French as well), but I was able to get it after jumping through some hoops
As soon as I get everything sorted, I hopped in my car, loaded up with a bunch of stuff and made the drive to Bordeaux
Roughly 900km from home, but I had some friends with me who were going to go surfing nearby, so we could switch drivers a few times
While I did bring my passport along, my identity card would have sufficed
Once I went through some administrative stuff to get properly enrolled at the University in Bordeaux, I lived my normal student life as I would have in Belgium
I went out to bars, went grocery shopping, cooked my dinner
Just everything I did was in French
The language was really everything that was different, as I just paid for everything with my Belgian debit card and everything
The most major "limitation" I had while there was that I had to spell out my name letter by letter every time someone needed it, as it was distinctively not French at all
EDIT: I'm not sure about the civil engineering market in the Netherlands but if you're not hellbent on living in the Netherlands, you can move one country over to Belgium (thanks to the free movement ;) ) and get a job here, as we're in dire need of civil engineers
Almost every civil engineering student out here has a job lined up for them months before they graduate
We have the highest density of castles per square kilometer
Untill the end of the Middle Ages (and even after that), 'Belgium' (or actually 'Belgica') and 'the Netherlands' used to mean the same thing
It meant all of the Low Countries
Belgica was just the Latin translation
Edit: when the Dutch gained independence Belgica was also used to refer to them
Now I know where I'm from
>Rovaniemi
O is in "open mouth in amazement"
What happened to Inari, Sodankylä, Kittilä and Enontekiö. Did these cities stop to exist ?
Many also don’t know that the English sent a counter-Armada as a response/retaliation, but which was equally unsuccessful and quite a disaster
Many also don’t know that the English sent a counter-Armada as a response/retaliation, but which was equally unsuccessful and quite a disaster
> The self-label Deutschland comes from the Latin [Theodiscus]
It's actually the other way around: 'theodiscus' is a latinisation of the West Germanic word \**þiudisk
Belgium has the most, because a mile is a larger unit then a kilometer so the same applies for them squared
And about wales they say it has the most per square mile while about Belgium they say it has the most per square kilometer
So according to mathematics and logic Belgium has the most
My nickname actually is Thomas The Dank Engine in both my friend groups who don't know each other lol
It is amazingly large for one administrative entity
I wonder how (for example) police officers do their work
I mean, the distances these people need to cover
Here, a postman fills my letterbox three times per week
how does this work over there ?
I also wonder if there is some sense of "community". Do people come together regularly in social events, or church or something ?
Most amazing
Very hard to grasp the concept, living in a place with neighbours one brick away (and currently engaged in an argument making a lot of noise)
> Other countries such as Germany favoured retaining the coins due to retailers' desire for €1

That's right it's 1

I only joined the Scouts for a short period of time, but it was exactly the same as the Swiss Scouts when I read your description of it
It was also just ment to be fun, we'd walk to some random place in our neighborhood and play games over there
The leaders where young adults (18-25 like you said) and also over here they all had their own personality and humor
We'd always do stuff outside, except if the weather was exceptionally bad
I didn't had the nickname thing, but maybe that was because I haven't been part of the Scouts for long enough
First off, there is no "boy" Scouts
Chapters are all mixed gender
It's mostly as you described in the Swiss model
In Belgium you have regular Scouts, which are but you also have other compeeding variants, like Chiro and KSA
There's some good rivalry between the variants, but it's all basically all similar to what your Swiss experience is like
Basically it's mostly social hangout activities for kids
There is certain aspect of real "scouting" (as in making camps from logs of wood in the forest, making fires etc) but these are mostly done in the summer camps
Throughout the year it's mostly fun games, and organising events to raise funds for the chapter
It's the same with special names (totems) and their are some advancement ceremonies accompanied with larger activities, but the focus is mostly on fun, especially among younger members
The "leaders" are the "older" members usually in their late teens/early 20's. It's expected to learn to work independantly in the chapter without further adult supervision and it's rare to have older supervisors or leaders, and usually these are people for whom scouting is a second life
So apart from fun, it's also a way to teach organisation, leadership, and cooperation skills to young adults
Something you didn't touch on
I've heard alcohol is a big no-no in the US scouts
Is it the same for Swiss chapters
The use is not prohibited, and I have a hard time imagining the Belgian scouting scene without beer
Many kids in scouting have their first drinks on scouting events, and among the older members
It's expected that the older members inspect the ones pre-drinking age, but it's not uncommon for them to turn a blind eye to minor infarctions
It's pretty much the same in Belgium as it is in Switzerland, but it's still separated between boys and girls
And we have the special names too
We call them totem names and mine was cheetah
Something you are told you'd carry your entire life
All I know about Belgian scouts is from my brother's experience
He became a scout at 16yo and based on everything he told me I'll say : drunk
Well not everyone ofc
I'll add that all the scouts from my city were rich bitches who bullied me for years  you can imagine I don't like scouts very much hahaha
How your scouts experience will be depends on the group and you yourself
Mine went overal well, great people, loved the leaders and the activities, but I personally didn't feel great in the group
The group did nothing wrong, everyone was realy friendly and all
I just felt uncomfortable so I left at age of 12
No regrets for having joined the scouts, no regrets for leaving
I would definitely encourage my hypothetical children to give it at least a try
The memories are good
Wow seems like you went to a very wrong group
Those ruin it for everyone
Because in general Scouts & Gidsen Vlaanderen is an extremely well organised and responsible organisation, but of course the different groups choose how much they want to follow their rules and guidelines themselves
I remember when we went camping, we once found a member of another group on his own in pitchblack woods
We called the leaders and apparently it was a 'punishment' and they were going to pick him up again a few hours later
The kid was on crutches for christs sake
I can't imagine how you can be that irresponsible
What if he wandered away
How in the hell were they planning on finding him
You literally couldn't see your own hand if you stretched it out, that's how dark those woods were
It always makes me so furious when I hear stories like that because normally the scouts are an amazing place to send your kids
I've learned all kinds of valuable skills and responsibilities
The survival things you were talking about are done and practised by every group I know
Setting up tents, shelters, HUDO, cooking (although not all the time), firemaking, navigating etc
It saddens me that there are some groups who are mainly in it just to get drunk with their mates
Haha children should be able to be dorks sometimes
We do
One of the oldest towns of Belgium, Tongeren, started out as the Roman settlement Atuatuca Tongrorum
Large portions of its Roman wall are preserved and it further honors that heritage by also housing the Gallo-roman museum
None are well´preserved, there is the gallo-roman museum
in tongeren
But they only have outlined where the original walls were build
In the museum they´mostly have artifacts
I happen to live in a town that was created by the romans
It started as a trading post and evolved i  a small town
If you dig deep enough you can find coins or shreds of roman roof
Neveneffecten - wildlife
The beat doesn't sound very interesting, but the lyrics are fabulous
Ain't really a guilty pleasure if it's one of the most universally liked songs (in my experience)
ja jongens we hebben de gabber gevonden
I am Belgian but I feel like “ Het is een nacht” is our guilty pleasure as well (and all Marco Borsato’s hits)
If you're going for any song by the Gebroeders Ko, it has to be "Ik heb een boot"
You should drink the right beer out of the right glass
You should double fry your fries and eat them with salt and a sauce (30+ different ones) of your choice
Couldn't agree more
Also they're Belgian fries, not French
Anytime that gets brought up anywhere, every Belgian agrees
Bless you
Please sir, we are a neutral country
I once went to Sziget and Stromae was performing
He went on this entire rant because someone had translated fries in his song to French Fries and every Belgian in the tent was screaming so loud in agreement
It was great
Good action, keep educating your felllow countrymen about the correct usage of glasses
Actually yes, when going to the frituur/fritery/fry place to take a pack of fries with a type of meat you need to have some kind of sauce to make the meal complete
When eaten in a restaurant with beef and a salad for example it is not necessary, or maybe a little bit of mayonnaise
There are a couple theories
One is that American soldiers called it French, because in WW1, while they where in Belgium, the official language of the belgian army was French
So they just called them French fries
Another one is that it's based on the verb 'to french'.
Don't forget a snack like frikandellen of bitterballen, always eat fries with a snack made out of mechanically separated meat
I loooooove Derry Girls
So sad the upcoming season was postphoned
You uhhhm, you think you guys can give us some money to improve the roads first
Get your Lays out of here
You name your snacks after zombies now
Once I played Halo with a guy for like an hour before checking his profile and seeing he was from the Netherlands
We were speaking English to each other the entire time
It happens all the time in Amsterdam (not with Belgians, but with Dutch speaking people)
A lot of people who work there actually don't speak Dutch, so usually I just address them in English
It often happens that, after a while, I find out that they actually speak Dutch
Then I switch to Dutch, they keep talking in English, I'm confused and return to English, then they answer in Dutch, we're both confused and just continue in English
Yup have it sometimes on festivals here
But their accent mostly gives it away
It happened to my father who was speaking with a Dutch person, he heard my father speaking French so he began to speak in French with my father and my father heard to his accent that he was Dutch so after a few minutes my father asked in Dutch (because he is bilingual) if he was Dutch because it would be easier for him to speak Dutch than a Dutch person trying to speak French and the Dutch person was completely bummed and said "so all the time I was making an effort trying to speak French with you, you could speak Dutch"
It's not English but it is similar
He couldn't tell you're Spanish from your Spanish ID card, but could from your last name
Did the same, thought a Swedish girl was from the UK - her English accent was so perfect I asked which part of the UK she was from
Edit: I am from the UK but live in Belgium
Wait, is it common for people to mistake Swedes for Canadians
Same especially in southern France
Oh wow I didn't know that
That's interesting, thanks
No, becasue they are not allowed to leave a package without a signature
They go to a package shop, if they fail to deliver it after a few attempts
You can pick it up there
I once saw a parcel at my neighbours front door and took it home, only to deliver it to them when they got home
I told them about the incident and advised them to make a complaint
It never happened again after that
It was in the summer of 2019
Delivery services don't leave packages unless you specifically ask them to
And most of the time you need to sign off on it
The only time I've known them leave it at the door is when they can see we're home, and they ring the bell without waiting for us to come out
only bpost does this
postnl dhl ups dpd all live it at our door but it probably depends on your region i live in a friendly street in pajotteland  but i imagine that in cities this wouldn't work
How did you recieve the packages then
I get mailbox delivery packages aswell but never that way
Post
nl has one of the best delivery guys of the region
He's a self employed driver so you can even  expect him to deliver on a saturday or sunday
Very friendly and overall nice guy
Couldn't agree more about this one
> Unfortunately, that character is of drunken Brits fighting and pissing in the streets
It's an acquired taste :p
J'ai mal au cou
Vs J'ai mal au cul
Got a sore neck Vs got a sore ass
Verrassing
= Surprise
Verassing
= Cremation
(Dutch "as" means ash)
This is the only Dutch word with a phonemic glotal stop
I love how the verb vögeln also exists in German
It is also a popular Flemish slang for sex
In Dutch, treffen only means to hit
We do have the expression: "Ah, dat treft
" (Ah, what a coincidence seeing you here
I believe it's about €900 a year, but it depends a bit from university to university
Textbooks not included, which can be quite expensive for some courses, especially during the early years
So overall, not as good as it can be in Europe, but definitely affordable to put your kids through college without going into debt, which is pretty awesome
Here in Belgium every citizen gets "points" for studying
We call them study points
When you first start out, I believe you start with 60 points
You can spend those on courses: 5 points for English, 15 for medical, ... (I'm making these up, I don't know the exact quantities)
If you succeed in a course, the first year you get double your points back
If you spend all your 60 points, and you don't fail any courses, you get 120 points back
After that every year, you get back what you spend on the course
Spend 10 points, and if you succeed, you get 10 back
Of course you still have to pay for housing, but you can also apply for grants and stuff like that
I don't really know what the situation is for foreign students, maybe they also get points, I don't know
If you don't have any points, you can also just pay for courses
I don't think they're exactly cheap, but they're not American-like expensive
Belgian beers and chocolates
Everything is expensive af in Belgium
We honestly can't complain
Our taxes though
That's a different story
In Belgium it is very expensive I have 1gb for 10€ and this is even the cheapest you can find in Belgium, before I had 250mb for the same price and even wifi and TV is super expensive around 30-50€
It's years ago that I had a decent thunderstorm in my region
We only know 3 weather's. Clear sky, cloudy or rain ... . This year we even didn't got a lick of snow
No, the thunder is okay and in itself it could be pleasant but thunder generally means lightning and I'm really scared of lightning
When I'm inside a closed off house or car I'm generally okay
But I wouldn't open a window, which has resulted several times into me overheating and sweating myself to death (not literally of course) in my room because I refused to open a window
During periods where lightning is more common I worry a lot about leaving the house
I'm terrified of being stuck outside while there's a thunderstorm
I don't have a car or a driver's license, so if I go somewhere it's always by bike
It really worries me a lot, I don't want to end up outside during a thunderstorm (definitely not among open fields) but I also don't want to end up in a situation where I have to let something important go for my fear of lightning like going to work or meeting up with friends
&#x200B;
I was once caught outside running in Florida when a thunderstorm came, luckily I made it to the house before it got really bad
But still it really really worried me
I was really tired and started to speedwalk (instead of run) but everytime I heard thunder I got so panicky that I started to run again
I also knew that Florida was the lightning capital of the US where yearly more people die of lightning strikes than in any other state
Yeah that didn't help ease my mind at all
Yeah but only when I'm cozy inside
Actually I feel very happy during any kind of storm when I'm cozy inside
Thunder is soothing
I love it
"Boterham", it means "slice of bread" but literally translated it means "butter ham"
Stokstaartje (meerkat) -> stick tail
Ovaries = eggsticks in Dutch
Random others:
- Snelweg = Fast road (highroad)
- Vrachtwagen = cargo car (truck)
- Drilboor = drill drill (drill)
- Baksteen = bakestone (brick)
- Verrekijker = far looker (binocular)
- Stoelgang = chair hallway (stool)
Mierenneuker = ant fucker (nitpicker)
muggenzifter = mosquito sifter (also nitpicker)
bleekscheet = pale fart (very pale person)
klokhuis = clock house (the core of an apple)
boterham = butter ham (sandwich)
gelukzak = happiness bag (lucky person)
And the second one
Klootviool
Lol I've never heard of that but it sounds really funny
I think those are mainly used in Flanders
I use them instead of wentelteefje
I've only heard of wentelteefje
Hallo
Mijn naam is Seppe, het is een genoegen jouw te ontmoeten
Van waar ben je
Hello
My name is Seppe, it is a pleasure you to meet
From where are you
Dutch/Flemish from Belgium
Yeah we have the same in Dutch
The obvious answer would be wolves but I like to be contrarian and actually believe boars are more deadly
Depends
Ticks, wasps and bees would cause the most damage due to allergies or lime desease (in case of the ticks) and their cheer numbers
The common adder is really rare to encounter and get attacked by, but they are our only venomous snake
Its venom also isn't *that* strong
We have gotten handful of wolves reïntroduced, they so far avoid humans but can attack sheep and have done so
The wild boar is probably the most dangerous to encounter in the wild
They are pretry common is certain regions and can lead to fatal accidents on the road, you also don't want to be charged by them
Cows, mainly the Belgian Blue can be dangerous aswell
To take a dark turn: Humans would still be the animal that cause the most fatalities to other humans
Tl;dr: So either we include humans, in which case we win
Otherwise it depends on the parameters
Likeliness of an encounter/attack
Likeliness of severe wounds/death in case of an attack
The wild boar would probably be second place with the first parameter, behind the creepy crawlers, and first with the second parameter
Boars
They don't seem that bad, but they can be terrifying and damn fast
Glad somebody spotted it
If a Belgian answers "wolf" here I want to strangle them
Fuckers are cowards
Much rather find them in the woods than boars or lynx
(although the change is high all 3 of them run)
The European viper is definitely not as dangerous as those other two
They tend to avoid human contact and theire bite is more than half the time not severe
(Confirmed in the wikipedia link you posted)
If you are attacked by a Brown Bear or Siberian Tiger you are more likely to die than if the common adder does attack you
To be fair, we meet far more often boars than wolves
Big spiders are usually not the one you need to be afraid of
Especially in Europe
Yeah wolves have actually returned to Belgium in the last couple of years
While it's a contributor, wolves simply don't kill many people, full stop
Predators tend to avoid unnecessary conflict
You don't see a lioness attacking a giraffe for example
Can't talk for the other guy but the problem is that in some languages there isn't really a distinction(same for things like "lend" and "loan")
Same word in dutch
A snake and toad can be "giftig".
> In a simulated battle our platoon of 3 tanks distroyed over 120 Leopard2 tanks in multiple waves without a single loss on our side
How the hell do you even pull that off
lmao
Frightening German efficiency
For Belgium:
The King is the head of state but has no political power
He is not even allowed to have any political opinion, unless backed up by a federal minister
He often does represent Belgium abroad in diplomatical missions
Technically he's also the commander-in-chief of our armed forces
Since he's a trained fighter pilot, I don't think people really mind that he is
The prime minister is the head of the executive branch of government
Usually, a couple of political parties who together have over 50% of seats in parliament will join in a coalition together and pick ministers and the prime minister among their ranks
The positive aspect of this is that the government can rule pretty efficiently, as the majority of parliament is of the same political color as the government
Side note: Belgium has a bit of a problem with forming coalitions every now and then
Back in 2011 it took us 541 days to form a government
It looked like we were going to break that record since there was barely any progress in forming one since the elections in May 2019, but the still acting government in "running affairs" as they are called was granted special powers to handle the current crisis
A monarch and president are pretty much the same position which is head of state and a prime minister is the head of a government
Chancellor like in Germany is pretty much a different name for prime minister
There are often some small differences in balance of power between those roles though
Oh man Belgium has a king, prime minister and 3 regional governments
It all works somehow (arguably, we haven’t completely descended into chaos as of yet)
We don't even fly our own flag (barring during the world cup)
They pay
Have free movement(of goods, services, people and capital)
Have no say in EU law
Have to abide by many laws with some exceptions(fishing and such)
-C’est arrivé près de chez vous, if you can talk french, it’s probably one of the best author movie that tou can find
Belgium - C'est arrivé près de chez vous
"c'est arrivé près de chez vous" known as "Man bites dog" in English (1992) from Belgium
It's a great dark comedy presented as a fake documentary following a serial killer
'The Broken Circle Breakdown' is absolutely great
Especially if you don't know what it's really about, it's effect is just amazing
The movie I enjoyed the most by far from Sweden is 'Let the right one in' - never found another move with an atmosphere quite like it
Gomorrah
It's still a mystery how that managed to lose the academy award to Shakespeare in Love
Sounds spooky
You know of New Kids Turbo
It's not a movie I'd expect to go international (except to my own dutch speaking Belgium of course)
It's not necessary but reading the Wikipedia page of the Easter rising helps a bit
You get the slightly more subtle references
Well it means fear so you're not wrong
I came upon it by checking imdb top lists IIRC - it was very well acclaimed, and rightfully so
And is it still as hilarious
Because here it makes fun of a certain stereotype, with certain hairdressing, clothing, language and cars
Well, I would say that the movie cures depression, so maybe watch it again, it could be the path to the enlightement we had around 2012
CERN
They had touchscreens waaaay before the rest of the world, who knows what kind of crazy technology they might have right now
The colonies
The Belgian equivalent is Kleine Brogel
It's common knowledge that it is an army base where US nuclear weapons are stored
But the Belgian government keeps denying it
Because it's quite a nice piece of stand-up comedy: this is Scheire's complete routine (in English) about CERN
It really is
Seg ge moet die hun idee ni zo afkappen
It’s basically « you are in hell, which one of the demons would you like to torture you
Not from Europe, but I'd definitely choose Jacinda Ardern
At least she has common sense
If not her, just anyone with common sense
Nicole Minetti
no man, that's a hydra
Yeah and our King is too
I love how different Flemish is to your guys' dutch
Nothing wrong with your dutch ofcourse but it's crazy to me how much they differ, for example, Flemish is a lot more formal even in informal situations
You guys say "jou" or "jouw" while we say "u" or "uw". The differences are in the small things and I love it
Dutch (flemish): I love our diminutives
We can make everything small, cute or a nickname by adding -tje, -ke, -je
Like they do it in Spanish: Bruno becomes Brunito
I lived in Australia and what I love about the Australian english is how they shorten everything
Arvo = afternoon
Brekkie = breakfast
Avo = avocado
Barbie = barbeque
Maccas = MacDonalds
And so on
I like how similar Dutch and German are
You can quite easily understand eachother without really having to adapt too much
Lekker lekker lekker lekker
For the rest i personally think dutch sounds kinda dumb, prefer it over french tho
>Re: the Dutch word "lekker", in German we have a similar word (lecker), but it is only used in terms of food being tasty (or maybe in like a sexual context I guess, though probably not often)
When I first moved to NL and heard people call other people lekker casually I was like excuse me what
Just so everyone knows, this is very much a Dutch thing
In Belgium 'lekker' wil only be used with food and in a sexual context like in German
Yeah I like how different the languages are in some aspect without really losing any connection
Same for Flanders
The town down the road has a wildly different accent/dialect than me (because of history, see below)
Move to a different province (which is maximum 50 km away) and you get a completely new way of pronouncing vowels and different vocabulary
And still we all (usually) understand each other
[Except for West-Vlaams] (sketch, dude is "mad" his dialect is being subtitled)
Check sidebar videos for more standard Flemish to compare
History: my city used has a [medieval hunting lodge/castle (built in 12C)] and the [next town over] were expert falconeers
They developed their own lingo to keep the rifraf from other villages from learning their secrets to falconing
And it just developed from there
So now I say "Ààrendoenk" and they say "Jèrendunk".
Dat is bij mijn weten nu ook geen waar, zeker in het noorden en westen van ons landje niet
I'm guessing he's talking about Dutch not Spanish
And I have to agree, gezellig is a really nice word
Nope
We say 'goe weer'
Het woord 'lekker' is pas naar hier gekomen wanneer de standaardtaal is ingevoerd in de jaren '60
Daarvoor was het gewoon geen onderdeel van de taal
Well in Belgium we eat our fries with mayonnaise, and that disgusts too much people
Américain préparé, it’s basically raw meat with seasoning and we spread it on our bread
Raw minced meat mixed with a raw egg, pickles,onions and tabasco
I heard several americans say they will not even try fries with mayonaise ( the only correct way btw) and that it disgusts them ???
Belgium
Ours are pretty tame compared to some others I bet
- kop ("leftover meat" in gelatin)
- ox tongue (usually in "Madeira sauce")
- ox tail soup (is that even weird
- some people like calve brains
- escargots
- blood sausage (though commonly found pretty much everywhere in Europe)
- people outside of our continent sometimes consider horsemeat weird, but other than riders, nobody would really bat an eye about it
Blood sausage is one of the best thing to eat in winter !
I studied in the States and when people saw me eating fries with mayo they were freaking out
Thank god for like minded people like you in the States
Why not, probably more from alles correct
As you know New York was first New Amsterdam, if you have a mix of English and Dutch alles correct becomes quickly oll correct
And Boston is close to NY
You never know, and we probably never wil certain
So, we have 6 governments now
1 federal one
3 regional ones: one for Flanders, one for Wallonia and one for Brussels; 2 for communities: one for the French speaking community and one for the German speaking community (yeah, we took some land from Germany as war reparations for the War)
What about the Dutch speaking community
Ah no, that one is combined with the regional one for Flanders
I know, confusing right
You know how the Germans just occupied us for 4 years and destroyed our country
About that
"yes, we're still a country
And no, French isn't the superior language"
You think that's snow falling out of the sky in Russia
Yes, a great modern nation that loves ~~PiS~~ peace
Thx for clearing that up
My intent wasn't really political, as I was just trying to make a (bad) pun
Financial district in Brussels maybe
Antwerp central station has nice modern elements inside too
I went to visit and it seemed very dead and empty tbh
Liege Guillemins station
Het Eilandje and Nieuw Zuid in antwerp are pretty modern too
Financial district
Antwerp is integrating more and more modern elements into the city
Nieuw-Zuid, Justitiepaleis, Havenhuis, MAS,  the currents works on both the leien and kaaien
I mean, google it
[Here's a decent pic]
Knowing both French and Latin, I understood a surprising amount of the Italian page about some boxer
Native French-speaker here :
* Gallician, Catalan, Portuguese : could understand most of them, they are rather close to French
* Spanish : same, but since I had Spanish classes in secondary school and university, hard to say what is the result of closeness to French or what I have learnt
* Romanian and Italian: could understand some of it, but clearly less, they are more difficult to understand from my native French-speaking perspective
Understood Spanish without too much trouble
Italian was hard
I understood a word here and there
Portuguese was easier to understand as I thought, but harder than Spanish even though they're very alike
Romanian, I understood a few words here and there but was even more unclear than Italian
Catalan was okay-ish
Kinda like Portuguese: similar to actual Spanish but didn't read as fluently as the latter
Galician was harder than Spanish too
Understood in great lines, but Spanish was definitely the easiest to get
French is my mother language
Baggins was translated as Balings
It absolutely means nothing and is not related to our word for bag at all
Then again, Thorin Oakenshield was translated very literally as Thorin Eikenschild, which just doesn't sound as cool
Then when we jump to the Witcher, I in general believe most names were kept the same, but some things got
weird
Dandelion got translated as Ranonkel
To start of, Ranonkel is such an obscure word that I literally did not know that it was a word until I looked it up
Secondly, it's not an archaic name for dandelion, but for buttercup
And for some reason the name of Geralt's horse, Roach in English or Plotka in Polish, was never translated and just stayed as Plotka in the Dutch translation
But once we get to ASOIAF, shit gets real arbitrary
The names of most keeps are translated, which I don't mind as most of them stay true to the original and don't look too out of place
But some first and last names are changed completely without rhyme or reason
Jeyne Poole's first name gets changed to Jaene, which is still a very weird name
Any name ending in -y gets changed to -ing, so Renly becomes Renling, Manderly becomes Manderling
Once again, I've no idea why, as the changed name is just as weird as the original one
Yes, absolutely
I'm so grateful to have had to opportunity to visit in seven years ago
I'm saddened at gut level, I'm from Belgium
In my city there was kind of an "architectural tragedy" of a similar kind during the Revolution when the [Cathedral of St-Lambert] was destroyed by the revolutionaries
It was a masterpiece of gothic architecture, one of the biggest in Europe, even Napoleon of all people thought that its destruction sucked
Of course, this is much worse because it's a Paris landmark, it's like the nose in the middle of the face of the city (even though the Sacre Coeur or the Eiffel Tower could hold that title, but if the Eiffel Tower collapsed, it would be much less of a tragedy IMO)
I don't understand people that honk at learning drivers
In my country there is a big blue L in your rear window, so anyone waiting behind you KNOWS that you're just starting to learn
It boggles me how they think that making the stressed young driver EVEN MORE stressed by honking at them will somehow make them go faster
Flemish and Dutch are the same language, written you wouldn’t know the difference (like British and American) and i never had any trouble understanding a Dutchman
I haven’t heard a lot of Frysian in my life but it’s pretty hard to understand for me, although it sounds familiar
Reading is difficult but understandable
Afrikaans is kind of the same, altough i would say that it might be easier to read and harder to understand than Frysian
Luxembourgish sounds like German to me, so i can make out some words but i can’t really understand it when spoken or written
I don’t know what Low German sounds like but i can’t understand it (idem to Luxembourgish)
Flemish is basically the same as Dutch
Dutch people should have no trouble understanding Flemish apart from some dialects like West Flemish
I have never had trouble understand a Dutchman
Spoken Afrikaans is hard to understand but I'll sometumes have a general idea what they're talking about
Written Afrikaans is a lot easier to understand though
Edit: after this conversation I realize it's actually super easy to understand
With Frisian it's kind of the same story as with Afrikaans, although it's slightly harder (both spoken and written) to understand what's going on
Never heard Low German/Low Saxon
I looked a bit at the Wikipedia from both Dutch Low Saxon (Low German spoken in the Netherlands) and the German Low German version and I could understand almost everything from Dutch Low Saxon, but Low German was a lot harder and I probably couldn't understand half of it
I wonder what dialect the Low German Wikipedia is based on
When I was in Luxembourg I heard some people speak Luxembourgish and I couldn't understand anything
It almost sounded like German but it clearly wasn't quite German
I can barely understand it written
I'll sometimes get a general idea what they're talking about but that's it
Low german and luxembourgish isnt really mutually intelligible with my language (Flemish)
I dont know much about Fisian,  but I think it's more mutually intelligible than Low German and Luxembourgish
Afrikaans is pretty mutually intelligible
Dutch is perfectly intelligible since it's thesame language
From my point of view (Belgo Luxembourgian) who used to speak Lux at school a long time ago
Lux-German/Low German: Still understandable
Lux-Flemish/Dutch: I understand a few words but I can't understand the more complicated word (there are still some word we have different Morgen/Moien but I understood them due to having learned German in Primary school)
Lux-[Frisian] Not at all, rarely a word sound familiar but without looking at the caption/traduction I can't really be sure what it say
Lux-Limbourg: More than regular Dutch
Dutch and flemish are mostly the same but there are many dialects of flemish so some are not the same and very different but standard Flemish is the practically the same as dutch
Afrikaans is understandable to someone who speaks dutch if they don't talk fast but it grammar is different and some words can be completely different so a dutch speaker will need to study afrikaans if they want to talk with a Afrikaner
luxembourgish is very different from dutch not intelligible Frisian is also very different from dutch it is hard to understand
Low German has more in common with dutch than German but it can still be very hard to understand if you also know some German the language becomes very simple but if you only speak standard dutch it is a lot harder
>  i never had any trouble understanding a Dutchman
That's interesting, because as a learner of Dutch and native French-speaker, Belgian Dutch and Dutch Dutch sound like different languages, it's hard to believe it's the same
The many hard g's and other random guttural sounds, the flatter melody, the words sometimes pronounced with an "English" accent makes Dutch Dutch so aesthetically different from the softer, more melodic, never English-sounding Belgian Dutch
What I notice when on holiday for example, many Dutch people do not recognise Flemish when they hear it, which I think is strange
It's not that they don't understand it once they realise it, but that initial "ah you're also speaking Dutch" trigger takes a good while longer
I always find that strange/funny :)
> Dutch - Local Flemish dialects: varies from difficult but doable to understand to totally incomprehensible, almost always subtitled in the Netherlands
Don't feel bad about that, most of the time it's subtitled here too :P
I feel you need to know that my mind read this with a Limburgs accent for absolutely no reason that I know of
All correct but I'd like to note that both West-Flemish and Limburgish, are seperate languages, while what we call Flemish is just Belgian Standard Dutch
Which is, like you said, just standard Dutch with a different accent, some words used differently and some words that the other doesn't use and vice versa
Flemish isn't a dialect of Dutch
It refers to the dialects spoken in Flanders
The official language is just Dutch
Wa bedoelde ge daar nu weer mee >:(
As a Flemish speaker I'm flattered
heavy West-Flemish dialect is completely unintelligible to ~~me~~ everyone
Brabants(region of Brussels) and general dialect mostly
Bit dumb to use it so much imo
Like, every Flemish person can probably speak enough dialect to make himself ineligible to over half of Flanders if they wanted to
Plenty of words that are basically known to be from my little town for example and are rarely, if ever, used outside of it and completely unknown 5 towns over
Have you seen French grammar
There are a lot of differences between Dutch-Dutch and Flemish, but grammar ain’t one
Goeiedag
Ik ben Gerrik Callewaert uit Bavikhove, deelgemeente van Harelbeke
Ik ben West Vlaming en kzoen geren tvolhende zehhen
Ik zien da beu da West Vlamingen assan ondertiteld wordn op televisje
ik vinkik da echt een skande
I may be from a different place, but reading about how the grains were compatible with an orange in French on the back is also something I'd consider nostalgic
Oh my grandparents live in Limburg and speak the dialect, I've always found it something like a blend of standard Dutch and German (as someone who doesn't speak German) with the adative of the melodiousnes of the Limburgs accent
I'm not sure how it varies with that spoken in the Netherlands (if it is spoken), I think i've always considered it similarly unintelligible to West-vlaams which wouldn't be strange considering they're the outer ends of the country on our side
Ik kan echt elk woord verstaan
Ik vind zoiets echt leuk haha
Ook de groeten
I can understand the first half i think: we can test it, maybe you understand me
We are ??????
Is that a bit right
Doesn’t Luxembourgish also have a lot of French mixed into it
Sure, that's why I precised that I'm not a native Dutch-speaker
When I had Dutch at school, we learnt the Belgian pronounciation and the audios/videos were in Belgian Dutch, so, this is what I have been used to
You will never be exposed to Dutch from the Netherlands in French-speaking Belgium
So, it was a bit a "shock" to discover the sonority of Dutch Dutch, whose aesthetic is quite different ; but with time I guess I could understand it to the same level I can with Belgian Dutch
Not at all, Walloon is an entirely different language
No, not really
Kzien à oek gère zene
Ge hebt gelijk
Net zoals wij veel vaker 'gij' en 'ge' zullen schrijven in chats zoals deze zullen Nederlands snel 'nou' gebruiken, iets was een vlaming vrijwel nooit zal gebruiken
Late reply but I think, as a Flemish speaker, that Dutch Dutch sounds different, but we've heard it enough to adapt to speak in the most understandable way for them
If I speak to a Dutchman I'll automatically adapt my sentences and pronounciation to a more clearer version
If I don't know beforehand that one is going to be speaking Dutch Dutch and expect Flemish, it'll take about three sentences for me to lay the switch in my mind and actually understand what they're saying, after that it goes without issues
So i do get what you're saying
Generally though I'd say a lot of children's shows were spoken in Dutch Dutch so you're used to the sounds enough to not be troubled
thanks, I generally don't know much about regional accents or dialects in the Netherlands other than the most obvious ones
Ik dacht echt dat Afrikaans toch meer verschillend was van het Nederlands, maar blijkbaar niet
It helps that I know a tiny bit of German
'villäicht' really looks like 'vielleicht' for example
Ah nice that you can still understand it
I can speak French and pretty much understand German yet Luxembourgish is just about the right combination of both for me to not understand it at all
Gy zet toch e patéke e
that's off, if you were to also suggest Flemish our r 's actually roll in the far back of our throat and are not what I'd suggest hard, tho I suppose the Dutch (generalising I don't know too much about regional accents there) don't roll it as much or as far back so it's likely to sound harsher
It's more complex but people generally use it to refer to the Dutch spoken in Belgium
Belgian Dutch or Flemish Dutch are better terms in this regard
It's the same language as Dutch from the Netherlands
"Wel", of "nu"
"Nou" gebruiken voelt echt absurd aan voor mij
I suppose that's valid, otherwise they'd need a seperate government and we already worked so hard to get it down to six
Ende is also Middle Dutch for 'and' :D
Yes, German dialects like Swiss German and the German of Vorarlberg I believe also makes my head hurt
I also can’t hold that against them
My Dutch is also a dialect which can be hard to understand so I’m not really in a position to complain about others
More like grandpa, I'm a man as far as I know
Nou seg wat een tyfuszooi
^(Ben ik nu een volwaardige Nederlander
Might depend on the region, southwest of province Antwerp here (Maline)
So the easiest dialectial sounds I think, but it's how I and everyone around me does it, you gotta be far enough back that you can roll it like the tongue r, except in your throat
Yes but American English also sounds different from  English in the UK
It's the same language
Amai, wat een armoede
A group, that's a key word
The standard language (standaardtaal) is the same in Belgium and the Netherlands
My initial comment said it groups the dialects of Flanders
It also includes de standaardtaal
Wel, wel
Nah, I'm fluently a cunt in both Dutch and English
Sometimes I feel less awkward speaking English
Some everyday sentences just make me cringe in Dutch
Nice
Me too I guess
But have you seen [this jewel] though
West-Flemish in a nutshell ;)
For me it's even funnier because I'm from the same area, so my accent is exactly the same when I speak my dialect
Hatred is a word too exaggerated but I think only inhabitants of Brussels like the capital
People living in provinces feel more connected to the region they live in
Monaco and San Marino
Bruxelles is not particularly disliked by the common Belgian
I don't know most people i know quite dislike Brussels
The ones I know say quite the opposite in fact
I visited Luxembourg City a couple of weeks
So many construction sites
But so damn beautiful that city is
I loved it
So is molesting kids, and well
It depends on the part you live in
I studied in Groningen for a year and felt the same :) It misses  a lot to be considered a 'vibrant' city, except for younger students maybe
There isn't too much diversity (people, events, concert halls, etc)
I guess it has to do with the fact that it's far from other urban development without having the characteristics to be an attraction pole in its own right
For example, I'm quicker in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Rotterdam, or any bigger Dutch city coming from Belgium than coming from Groningen
Had a good time though, but the city itself isn't thát memorable
Yeah,  back in 2018 because of a immigration deal
Took us 2 years to get a new government lol
Have our governments ever collapsed
Hahahaha
\*reads it again\* HA HA HA HA HA HA
This is Belgium, mate
We're veterans
And in 2010 over BHV, and in 2008 over Fortis (which happened live on tv)
At least the Dehaene and Verhofstadt cabinets were more stable
Not that they weren't plagued by scandals and resigning ministers, but at least they didn't collapse
The Belgian government doesn't fall that often compared to many other European countries
It's just that WHEN it falls, the political parties are completely unwilling to form a new government
We have the most childish politicians of Europe
And the voters love it
Both Walloon and Flemish voters purposely vote for political parties that "don't do compromises". It's like the voters don't want a government
Actually we were
Nothing major happened, we could all go on with our lives in that time, and thats just the way we like it
If he was talking about the Palais de Justice (Law Courts of Brussels): I've never known it without scaffolds
Even the scaffolds were in scaffolds for a while
Belgian election results aren't more divisive than elsewhere
Many European countries are forced to have minority governments
It's just that in Belgium, parties refuse to approve minority governments
This gives the fake impression that Belgium is uniquely difficult to govern in, while in reality on paper it's just as difficult as any other country, it's purely unwillingness to do it like they do it abroad
I mean, we've got a couple of backup governments who deal with the shit we actually notice
> Nothing major happened
Except the pandemic
Just waiting for multiple layers of scaffolding and becoming a tourist attraction
I sure hope so, I wouldn’t imagine the mess it would make in a country which would have more per capita than we do
In Flanders it’s even seen as weird if you don’t know French and English
Being monolingual is pretty rare in Belgium
For starters, you would need to know French or Dutch to understand half of your fellow countrymen
If you live in Flanders, none of your english media is dubbed, just subtitled, so you pick up quite a lot as you go (I was already somewhat proficient in English before ever getting it in High School, due to consuming lots of English media and it being closely related to my mother tongue)
Here in Belgium, when you take ASO high school (which is the most theoretical, "highest" section of high school in Flanders), you're supposed to know at least four languages: Dutch, which is our native language, French, which they speak in Wallonia and is our second official language (we start learning it when we're about 10-11), English, which we start learning at about 14, and German, which is our third official language and which you start learning at 16 (in ASO)
In many schools you have the option of learning even more languages, my old school for example, gave the option Italian in your last year (when you're 17-18)
The "lower" sections of high school (less theoretical and traditionally viewed as less than ASO, even though that's stupid): TSO, BSO and BUSO, learn at least Dutch, French and English in high school (again, in Flanders
I believe that in Wallonia you have the option for Dutch, but its not mandatory like French in Flanders (not entirely sure about that, but many people say that here in Flanders)
But yeah, I turned 18 yesterday and I speak fluent Dutch, fluent English, decent French and not too bad German
(I went to ASO for 5 years, I'm currently dubbeling my 5th year in TSO
We have 6 years in ASO, most of TSO
A lot of BSO and a few TSO sections offer 7th years which are kind of mandatory if you want the full diploma)
In Belgium we should be able to speak the other main language, so the Flemish learn French, but the Walloons often don’t learn Flemish, which is kinda sad
We (Flemish) also learn English, and often take German classes
Kiev was a strange experience
Restaurants had on average one staff member who spoke English
One time they had to get someone from the kitchen to translate because my Russian was not good enough to understand the waiter's Ukrainian
I think I spoke all languages there just to find my way
Someone spoke French, another German, which I could make sense of
Now a random post office to buy stamps, that was a frigging adventure
Nobody spoke anything but Ukrainian, not even the people in line behind me
So in my best Russian я хочу две марку, пожалуйста. But apparently I needed six, for two postcards
Then my visa card didn't work (because they put it in backwards)
After I paid they ran off with my postcards, waving me off
Eventually the cards arrived at their destination but it was still a weird experience trying to figure it all out without Google translate
TL:DR Kiev was great
But next time I'm getting some mobile data to have Google translate (and maps) with me lmao
If you have interest in learning Norwegian, yesterday I happened to find Beginner Norwegian classes on the site Futurelearn
You can follow it for free, there are some drawbacks to the free version, like you can only access the class for 6 weeks or so and not for an unlimited time
But normally that time frame should be enough to finish the class
&#x200B;
As a Belgian, yes we would easily switch to English when speaking to a foreigner
To make the communication go better
It's a gesture of friendliness not to let you struggle while we're more than capable of talking to you in a language you're comfortable with
As a language learner myself I can understand that struggle
Generally what I do, is even if people greet me in the other language, I will respond in the local language
After a few times back and forth they generally get that I'm trying to practice
You could also say something like 'Is it okay if we speak ...? I'm learning it
" I think many people will respond positively to the the fact you have interest in their mother tongue
I don't understand the snobbish reaction, that's very unfortunate
The only way I could understand that is if you tried to speak French in Belgium but when you were in Flanders
Flemish people speak Dutch and generally speak way better English than French so it would be very strange to us if an English person tried to communicate in a language we both suck at instead of in English which is easier for both of us
Also they might feel slightly offended if they assumed that you didn't know the difference between Flanders and Wallonia and assumed that all Belgians speak French
But even then I don't think a snobbish reaction is appropriate though
I'm sorry you met the wrong people, most of us are normally not that rude (I would hope)
My Russian just isn't that great to keep up
I constantly had to ask people speaking it back to me to go slower or repeat
I learned a lot, but I noticed it too that languages outside of their own wasn't their strong game
Yeah I get the frustration
It's even more difficult because you know they do it to be helpful and you don't want to come over as disrespectful
This is very rude except:
-If you are helping them with cooking
-If they ask you to take something or if you asked for permission
-If you are at your sibling's, parents' or maybe best friend's house and you visit them regularly
-If you are a babysitter
It depends
If you're with family or a good friend it's no problem, at least if you have a reason to look in the fridge
With strangers or people you don't know well it's not appreciated
* ***France*** : their cuisine and food variety, how they preserved and promote their patrimoine/heritage/history, the nice architecture of many towns
A lot of literature too
In French-speaking Belgium we adopted and like a lot the ideals of the 1789 revolution
But specifically the 1789 ones, and some parts of the Napoleonic legacy/heritage
* ***Netherlands*** : their cycling culture, I wish it could be imported to Wallonia more (although, Wallonia isn't the most practical place to ride a bicycle, too many hills)
Some degree of social progressism, and openess towards sexuality
Probably where I would emigrate if I had to move to a neighbouring country, despite being a native French-speaker
* ***Luxembourg*** : their relative social progressivism too : free public transports, legal cannabis (not a smoker, but well, having it illegal is hypocritical when alcohol is legal)
A whole part of Wallonia used to be part of the Duchy of Luxembourg, and my father-side family is from the province of Luxembourg, so, there is a good deal of links between Wallonia and this country, even though the culture and languages aren't the same
* ***Germany*** : their industrial music, Neue Deutsche Härte, gothic music and neo-traditionnal music scene
Aside English, German is probably the language I listen to the most in music
And even if it is rather forgotten by both Wallonia and Germany, we spent centuries together as part of the Holy Roman Empire (from pre HRE in 843 to its foundation and until 1795
Our social security/welfare model is heavily inspired on the German model, and our relationship to power and politics today is a legacy from the HRE times
* ***United Kingdom*** : their humour, their movie industry, TV series, part of their literature (Stoker, Shelley, Mielville, Poe, Blake, Conan Doyle)
I like to listen to BBC 4 as well, BBC as a whole is a nice TV and radio channel, much better than French television in my opinion
I like their style/fashion as well, and how some places look like stuck in the 50's aesthetically/visually
I find interesting as well how their conservatives are less backward than continental conservatives : such as making same-sex marriage legal
Netherlands: that they are so innovative and they buy all the new stuff apparently (literally just learned about this yesterday)
There are like 20 times more electric cars and it's just way more modern in general
France: Amazing history, culture and places to visit
Luxembourg: Cheap gas
No, that they're more progressive socially
Germany: That they haven't invaded us in more than 70 years
The Dutch do have best free time\\ work time balance in the world
You guys are more organized and in some fields way more advanced than us
E.g. I study pharmacy and one of our professors keeps talking about things that are better in the Netherlands than Belgium
And of course bitterballen, stroopwafels and snackwalls
Well, I learnt something, ah
His style seemed so British to me
> I always forget about them
Lol, they're you're only actual neighbour if you don't consider a bridge as a border
How dare you
How dare you call it patat
Yeah totally, I can't drive home through Belgium
You van stop right there and still be correct
In Belgium we celebrate cailliau as the inventor of the internet
Thank you
Dries van Langenhove, an extremist right wing politician
We don't want or need him, pls take him Luxemburg
Gwendolyn (T)Rutten, she is just is the most moronic "liberal" and has successfully driven her party into the ground
Unfortunately, there are many people who do want him
I don't think we're going to get rid of him soon
It seems like 28% of Flanders does want him
I was looking for this
I don’t think everyone who voted VB is a fan of DVL necessarily, I have some VB-voters in my life and none of them like DVL
You need to prove that the name already exists
In the past, the name had to appear on some list somewhere or be derived from one of the names on that list
My grand-father had a colleague that was called Odil De Krok, so if you start with his last name it's De Krok Odil (the crocodile)
I feel bad for him but it's pretty creative and funny lmao
One that comes to mind for me is "Kim".
Male or female
Depends on culture
In mine it's female but there are places it's male
Same reason you wouldn't name somebody "hooker" basically
"Joseph Hooker (November 13, 1814 – October 31, 1879) was an American Civil War general for the Union"
Fun fact: there used to be 3 names in French which were written the same, boy or girl: Claude, Dominique and Camille
Obviously this changed in the last 40 years
Now there are several accepted gender neutral names
Never heard of that one
But a man named Anne would definetly be weird
Same for boys who are born today and who would be named Camille
Some name attributions definetly change over time
Depends on what you are looking for
pretty much all our musea are about a very specific subject
War, which war
Art, modern or classic
Science
Midieval musea
(Any castle really, I have fond memories of "Het Gravensteen in Ghent, but also about the Castle of Bouillon and the Citadel of Dinant)
I'm not into art and I often find war depressing so I'd go for science:
Museum for natural-science in Brussels (it has a great dinosaur collection aswell)
And even though Technopolis in Mechelen doesn't like to call itself a musuem but more of an "interactive-centre" for science and technology, it is great for kids to come into contact with both
I'd call it an interactive museum
Train World is the greatest museum I've ever visited
It is not at all boring and has some very cool stuff: Obviously lots of noteworthy locomotives and carriages from the past
But also interactive maps and info of the development of our railways, the beautiful station building of Schaerbeek, a railway set, simulator and even a real "seinhuis" (= signal house) that they didn't demolish but build the museum around
How crazy is that
I also liked the House of European History, specifically because it only asked questions and provide objective information
It specifically wanted to be apolitical and leaves visitors to make their own conclusions and opinions, which I really appreciated
It was also just a nice museum in a beautiful building and with some cool stuff
Honourable mentions are: the Museum of Natural Sciences and C-Mine in Genk
Also the Africa Museum which has been totally revamped
The exhibition now openly talks about the wrongdoings of the colonial era and also sheds a light on modern Congo
Do parents in your country sometimes talk in a different language if they want to discuss something without their children hearing it
Here in the Flemish part of Belgium, most parents tend to switch to French if they want to discuss something without their (small) children knowing about it
Mostly it is used to discuss bedtime, but it usefull for a great many things
For example, you might want to ask your partner which (unhealthy) dessert they might want after the kid goes to bed, without tempting your kid
Today, for another example, we used it while visiting a Zoo and to discuss if everyone was okay to leave before breaking the news to the kids
Children only learn French from about age 10 onwards so it's a usefull tool for a long time
We tend to learn several languages in our education, so we kinda take this option for granted, but I wondered if parents where you live also do this
Which language would you use apart from your native tongue
I live in Flanders too,  but my parents never did that
a lot of belgians here haha
and no my parents didn't do this
Yes
My grandparents used to speak in Flemish when they didn't want my ( french speaking ) father to hear something
Yes, but not so much than before
In the french part of Belgium, when adults/grand-parents wanted to talk about something without the children knowing, they talked Walloon
Since Walloon is not that common anymore we hear it less and less
But my mother and my grand-mother sometimes continue to speak it around my little cousins
I understand it now so it’s a bit useless “against” me
Exactly
My Flemish parents had heated discussions in French which is actually the reason I use French curse words to this day
I guess the example you give could happen in theory and I know both of my parents are proficient enough in French to do it, but they just never did
At what age do they start to teach Irish
Same here, my parents only know Dutch to my knowledge, never heard them use any other languages other than the odd basic English word from some song or smth
If they had something private to discuss, they'd go to the bathroom or hallway or something while we were eating or something
Quite common in my social circle (Antwerp region)
I figured everyone did this
Mine neither, then again I guess my father would understand as much as I did
But I myself did this yrick a few times when giving a youthcamp for asking the time, discussing whe´ to stop a game, etc
I remember my parents used to do this
Same here
Parents never spoke french
Just told us to go to the living room or our bedroom
My parents did it
Not only did they speak in French, but also in English
In my experience when switching to a different language it is 70% of the time snack related
aren't most hungarians monolingual
I figured most of Europe taught at least one foreign language
Anyway, don't think too much of our French proficiency
After school you tend to not use it for years unless you're on a holiday, or for rare reasons like this
There's very little cultural interaction between the two sides of the country
Dutch and English are I credibly closely related, more so than German and English
. Dutch is the easiest language to learn for English speakers
I'm from Antwerp as well, but I don't think I've ever heard of anyone doing that iirc
Basically no game(or much on tv) is translated in dutch
I remember back playing PS1 games and often it was like 4 big flags, English, French, German or Spanish
First generation of pokemon taught me a lot
Many moves including verbes and such
Here in Belgium we only begin learning English in 8th grade but the English teachers basically assume you know English
Bad times for immigrant kids sometimes because of it
Algerians will speak French at home for example so they tend to be bad at English
i've heard frisian is even more similar
i have no idea if that is true
yeah now that i think about it, in our english classes in flanders the teachers assumed you already knew english to an extent
it didn't start at zero
i don't remember people having much problems besides some moroccans but they managed to catch up
we started having english at school when we were 13 for the record
I'm from 91 and got the first generation pokemon games as soon as it came out
The place I was stuck on mostly was getting into the 6th gym town
Fuck knowing they needed a drink
One day I just accidentally passed them
Getting HM03/HM04 was another pain in the fucking ass but I was stuck there for so long I guess I got it in the end
I got past boulder cave without using flash
Pretty sure I had the HM for it too
Most fun experience with it was my first playthrough though
I just kept spamming A when learning a new move
So I ended up with 4 status moves on Pikachu
It is
They used to be one language
The differences between English and Dutch are tiny compared to other languages
I had so much issues learning English the first few years, because I really was starting at 0, and the handbooks and teachers weren’t.
The way you phrase that makes it seems like those 3 are the only games on the market :p.
Savescumming before having to choose an option untill it works out is how i finished Yellow and Red
Generally I'd say it's sweet depending on the setting, but usually tourists or people from the other side of the country either address in English or in French, it's nice to practice my own language learning though so not too bad either way
I'd love to help, it just depends on the time I have and the place we are in
In Belgium natives are happy when other natives speak their native language
Not my experience, in Belgium I'm considered quasi bilingual in Dutch and French but once in Paris the shopkeepers and staff will interrupt me and start in English very annoying
Had the same experience in Amsterdam when they hear a Flemish accent
I had just the weirdest experience with locals while studying abroad in France
I was following all of my lessons in French, so I obviously knew enough to have a normal conversation, and stuff like ordering food was no problem at all
However, whenever I ordered something, it must have been pretty clear that I was not a native speaker, because the server would instantly change to English (this happened more than once)
I appreciate the effort, but I understood them perfectly in French and it's obvious they have some trouble with English, so it just made the interaction harder for both of us
I've always felt it's normal to adapt to the person you're speaking to, a subconscious way for me to adapt is to go to a clearer standard Dutch if I'm in the Netherlands, same for children I try to speak clearer whilst older people I usually speak to with a heavier accent
So it's only natural to adapt to tourists or people learning the language to me aswell
My favorite one in Turkey was "Alles Gratis
Alles Gratis"
&#x200B;
that was thus a fucking lie
It depends like most things, but I don't think it's an issue if it's about things such as asking directions at all
Perhaps if you start a full on conversation in fluent French expecting them to be able to go along as easily but I think that's fairly logical
> The other thing that might happen occasionally, for some reason my accent in french sounds like flemish so people might switch to flemish
That might be because quite a few Flemish people don't take kindly to being addressed in French without being asked in advance, as if it's just taken for granted
It's a historic grievance
If they immediately switch to Dutch it's an assertive way to say 'you're in Flanders, we speak Dutch here'.
Ah well I see then, I suppose I depends on how you grow up treating dialects and such, I believe in general we just act different around dialects here
Either fries or waffles
Most Belgians would say fries but I think most non-Belgians would say waffles
So many to choose from
chocolate, stoofvlees, french fries, hop, etc
I guess I'd go for french fries because that's a smell you'll often smell just walking down the street
And dark chocolate
Too bad those don’t go together
As the other one said, dark chocolate or beer (Trappist maybe
) would work aswell, with dark chocolate being the most heavenly intense smell of them all (not saying fries or waffles don't smell good, but kinda hard to replicate on a smelling card)
Yes, so definitely fries
Edit: spelling
By the way, how do I edit the flag and land name like everyone here
My first thought was peanuts
Doesn't smell as good though
You know how to Belgium
Yeah true I just chose my 2 favourites from our country :)
Edit: and also because that's what you'll smell the most while walking in Belgium
(If you're on mobile)
Go to the subreddit
Press the 3 dots in the upper right corner
'Change user flair'
That's true, but I feel like the frietkot culture is a particularly Belgian thing that doesn't really exist in other countries
But fries are bad outside of Belgium and northern France, they don't know how to properly make them
French fries
Yes
Proper Belgian fries
Only in and near Belgium
So is chocolate, beer and basically any food or drink nowadays
>Yeah true I just chose my 2 favourites from our country :)
Those are good choices, so :)
>and also because that's what you'll smell the most while walking in Belgium
Bakeries too though
Those three are only surpassed by the beautiful and fresh smell of exhaust fumes
Ah finally, big thank you
Upper Northern France and Southern Netherlands too, bassically small towns near the Belgian border
It's basically in a region tightly surrounding Belgium
Zever gezever
Maastricht is de place to be
Experienced this when hitching through Spain to Porto
Got picked up by a guy from El Payo who just arrived by plane from his home in Eastern France
The village was filled with French Spaniards because it was summertime
During the year only 500 of a couple thousand actually live there
Beautiful little village, so sad
Went to see a little dam for electricity production nearby which got started but never finished somewhere in the 70s. I wouldn't wanna stay in a place with such corruption
Is it known to be a hub for software development
Why exactly would you like to go there
Is it nice, cheap, higher wages than Bosnia, ...?
I think it should be legal, but with certain restrictions
(Amount, location, age)
I like the idea of the coffee shops in the Netherlands where you can actually smoke in a safe space(?) It would be nice if there were places with experienced and professional staff that could comfort you in case of a bad trip
&#x200B;
I've smoked weed before, and I have nothing against it, but there are some people in my college dorm building that smoke every single day, and it's so annoying having to smell it everywhere/be bothered by high people all the time
Legal after having a smoker's license
How to get that license
-prove you have work and are useful in society
-prove you study and get a useful degree
-prove you didn't steel to buy it
Yes offcourse
There is no better hack than legalisation to put the streetdealers off side
Also it would be a new income of tax like sigarettes which I don’t have a problem with it
If you see to the US how much extra income they had by legalizing
All the politicians have a weong look on it as they grew up learning that drugs are bad
Which isn’t complety true as they use hallucogenes to takle depression an anxiety
It works better than some medicines that only enriches the pharma industry
Offcourse there are going to be problem cases just like with everything else (alcohol, coffee, perscription drugs, sugar)
The medical value is a double edged sword
I have seen some cannabis-induced psychosis and it isn't pretty
If this wasn't 'just' cannabis (with the entire lobby behind it) and instead a medicine developed by a pharmaceutical company, it would never get released to the public with the side-effects that cannabis has
No way
I'm still for legalization btw, punished addicts isn't helpful in the slightest
Nope, there will be to many taxes
You will pay 1g of outdoor thai 15€
*Moreover, during adolescence, cannabis is associated with increased psychiatric emergency department (ED) visits15,16 and increased risk for psychosis,17 with some research suggesting that it might as much as double the risk for psychosis and schizophrenia
18*
Double the risk for psychosis and schizophrenia
I have seen A LOT of CIP
I work with the mentally ill
My advice if you have any kind of mental problems (but certainly anything on the schizophrenic or psychosis scale): do not smoke cannbis
It will fuck you up double as hard
I don't have a problem with people smoking pot, I just don't like how it's almost treated like a herbal remedy
It's not
It has serieus potential side effects and nothing is said about it
Imagine if immodium came with these kind of side-effects
No way it would be legal to sell
I knew for a long time that the Dutch had claimed sealand to build on it when I was a kid
But I had the wildest theories on how they'd done it
First I thought they just built land that floats on top of it
Then when I saw the dikes I thought they mustered a lot of bulldozers and had pushed all at once
Then I was given a pretty bad explanation of how it's done so I thought they closed a part of the sea off then scooped the water away with buckets
I used to think that Greenland was almost as big as Africa (because of Mercator you know)
Also that Denmark bordered Norway, Sweden and Switzerland for some reason
And the strangest one: When people talked about Poland, I thought they meant the North Pole and the South Pole because in Dutch Poland = Polen and poles (as in both the north and south pole) = polen
It's the same fucking word
Edit: and also that Kaliningrad wasn't owned by anyone
Because in the maps in my school, it didn't get named
I thought it was just useless land that no one wanted lol
When i was a kid i thought Finland had Eskimos
As a child I always thought the French, Italians, spains and portugeese spoke the same language
I thought, when I was a child and before geography classes, that all the Balkan peninsula was Greece, with the norther borders of Croatia, Serbia, Romania being its northern border/included in it (since I had never heard of these countries)
Then I discovered that Greece was just a tiny part in the south of Balkan, and the existence of other countries there
I used to think countries where shaped as you wrote their name
Oh come on
And I used to think it was in Belgium because everyone just says the Dutch name: Duinkerke
I'm also a map (and flag) nerd
Although I don't know all the capitals, I know the place of every country on the world map and I know all the flags
scandinavia being different than the scandinavian peninsula is just asking for confusion
like vlaanderen that doesn't have it's municipal in o-vlaanderen or w-vlaanderen, but brussels in brussels, that isn't a part of vlaanderen
My recommendation would be Bergen, Copenhagen, Krakow, Vienna, Isola Bella (or in general the Borromean islands, not a city but very beautiful islands in Lago Maggiore  in northern Italy)
Edit: spelling
If you want to go from west to east, yes
I interpreted it wrong and assumed OP just meant you have to choose cities that aren't from the same part of Europe or the same country and north to south would be allowed too
Isn't it crazy expensive
I'm curious
The problem with any “brand” of coffee is that by the time you get it, it’s stale
Coffee is best consumed within 2 weeks of roasting it, at the very most 4 (which already clearly tastes less good) Espresso is a bit more forgiving with a darker roast, but wouldn’t push it beyond 6 weeks
The only real option to get this quality of coffee is to source it locally (which I prefer) or online with a roaster who puts a “roasted on” date on the package, or where you know the roast is maximum
a few days old (as is the case with one of my go-to roasters here locally, but I still always ask them)
I don't like how it tastes, it's very bland imo
So you studied art school in marseille
Not in my language, but when I was in Colombia, I remember someone said "sorry to molest you" because molestar is to bother/disturb in Spanish and he translated it thinking to molest is the same as molestar
Good thing I understand enough Spanish to understand the confusion
Same applies to dutch I think
"Ik ben zo opgewonden"(winded up would be the literal english translation) could easily be both understood as stressed, excited or aroused depending on situation
BUT
Without context it's understood as arousal
Not really
I'm one of the last millenials
Because I'm still studying at 25, I have a lot of contact with students of Gen Z. They're supposed to be a different generation but I hardly notice any differences compared to students from 1993-1995 when they were 18-19
why not
you go to the ghost, ask their name and adress, move on to the next ghost
easy
Yeah same everyone says it constantly
Really, is IJ a name
Oh ok
I thought a name for a person lol
I know the Dutch can have weird names but IJ is weird, even for you guys
Green olives definitely
They are easier to find in shops that the black ones
Cant speak for the entire country, but i feel like its about equal here
Definitely green
Even in mixes they try to favour the green one
For some reason people in general seem to prefer green olives over here
Don't know why though, both taste good to me
Their Instagram is also S tier
And their clothes/goodies are way nicer than the Nasa one
Man I almost cried :(
In Belgium, once you are in Wallonia (3
6 million inhabitants) or Flanders (6
6 million inhabitants), it's like living in a monolingual country
Everything will be in either French in Wallonia or Dutch in Flanders, and nowadays, few people really learn the other language or continue to learn it/speak it after secondary school
The only place that is somehow multilingual is Brussels region (1
2 million inhabitants), even though French dominates, and you'll hear English more often than Dutch
However, speaking Dutch will be a requirement for many jobs there
I think it's annoying (I'm Flemish)
No offense to Walloon people but we have different mentalities
We have different newspapers, different tv stations, different political parties and even different governments (we have like 3 ministers for everything)
Wallonia always votes left, Flanders more liberal/right
That's why our federal government never functions the way it should
In 2010 we took the world record of being the longest without a government from Iran, it took us 541 days to form a government
At the moment we are on our way of breaking our own world record again (and corona is not the reason for this)
One of the only things holding our nation together is our national football team
We have a royal family but no one particularly likes them since we never hear from them and they are just very boring
In Flanders we have to learn 8 years of French in school (10-18y)
In Wallonia they don't have to learn Dutch in school (they can choose between Dutch, German & English I think)
So ofcourse no one chooses Dutch since it's less spoken
Even in Brussels, where everything should be Dutch and French, they don't understand Dutch in a lot of stores
The French of the younger generation in Flanders is not as good as it used to be since we only hear Dutch and English on tv/radio
I live 20min drive away from the Flemish/Walloon border and I don't know anyone there
It really just feels like a different country
Here in Flanders where the majority of people live we learn French at school but in Wallonia where the minority lives they can choose to learn Dutch but few people actually do it
So the system is broken, and lot of people feel the same way
Even suggesting to replace the mandatory French with more English is somehow seen as insulting and bad
It's really fucked up
Belgium has super strict laws to protect each community's language
This means a flemish community absolutely cannot help you if you speak French or the other way around
All official statements are also in Dutch, French or German in their respective communities
The base of this law is the marginalizing of the Dutch-speaking community in the past
Because education is a competence of the communities, each community gets to decide what each student should know at the end of their education
The Flemish community decided to start teaching French at age 10, as a mandatory first foreign language
However, the Walloon community give their students the option to choose between Dutch, English and German
And almost all of them choose English
As a result, most Flemish can speak some French, while most Walloons speak pretty terrible Dutch
And this goes all the way to the top, there are plenty of Walloon ministers on the federal level who's Dutch is downright terrible (honestly, I can't say much about the German community as there's not a lot of politicians from that area who go federal)
Luckily, each statement by the federal government is in all  three official languages
All laws also have an official translation in Dutch and French, but the German translation is usually unofficial
As a side effect, the current press conferences about the coronavirus are horrible
The slides that accompany each conference switch back and forth between Dutch and French and you have to be proficient in every language to get everything
The prime minister's Dutch is also quite bad, leading to a lot of animosity along the Flemish
Come check out r/belgium, where the official language is
english, because it would be unfair to the other communities if we picked one
Dutch, French and German posts are allowed though
The famous Belgian compromise
PS: Belgium has three communities, the Flemish, the Walloon and the German community
The German community is the smallest, representing only 1% of the community, next is the walloon community, representing 31,8% and the biggest is the Flemish community, representing 57,6%. The 11% unaccounted for is Brussel, because it's bilingual and the Belgium Bureau for Statistics doesn't track languages, only residence
You should know most of Brussels is French
So we have three languages in Belgium: Dutch, French and German
While I do have some French on me I don’t speak a word of German (I can understand some of it because it’s sometimes similar to Dutch) so yeah I can’t communicate with every Belgian
I also think in Belgium we have a very different culture between Flanders and Wallonia, which I think is neat but means some people would like to split up
Political-wise it’s a mess however
We are such a small country but we have 6 governments, and also very different political tendencies
Wallonia tends to be more left-wing while Flanders unfortunately leans to the right
The federal government is bilingual
ETA: In Flanders it is mandatory to learn French at school (from the age of 10), but in Wallonia it’s optional to learn Dutch
Belgium is a construction of two countries that share some political matters, in almost all areas there is a divide between the French and Dutch speaking part
Wallonia, the French part, seems to follow France in all possible aspects while Flanders, the Dutch part, is rather more a stand alone country, but sets the Netherlands as an example
In the past, Wallonia used to be more prosperous and wealthy so many Fleming worked there and could hold a (basic) conversation
Nowadays, French knowledge has seriously decreased however the Flemings still better speak French than the Walloons speak Dutch
Even in Brussels most people are not even close to bilangual
Yes if you want to work for a big company it will be a requirement
But for "normal" jobs it mostly is just seen as a plus
I'm dutch speaking living in Brussels, my French is decent but far from fluent
Whenever I'm in restaurants or something I always ask if they speak Dutch (dutch Is an offiacial language in brussels, 4/5 cases they'll look at me weird and try to speak a few word and I will switch to French
Even in the city hall/police station of my own municipalitiy, next to no one speaks dutch
The dutch speaking schools are packed with French speaking people, which I, as such, don't have a problem with, but they don't actually want to learn dutch, they just speak french and assume you do to and they look down on us, they call us "les Flamands" (even when I don't really identify as Flemish) and it really divides our schools and limited the people I could be friends a lot
It sucks
I believe English is spoken on all 6 of the islands (and Dutch is barely spoken)
But on the ABC islands, the most common language is Papiamento, a weird Portuguese-Spanish-Dutch creole I believe
> In Wallonia they don't have to learn Dutch in school
That is not true, many schools in Wallonia have mandatory Dutch
I had, and it was a public school ; was in ASO for the record
I've more than once heard Wallonians say that Flemish people are barbarians which is actually really fucking insulting considering the state they are currently in themselves
A mix of English, French and Dutch as I seem to understand it
Our coach is Spanish, so I'm guessing they will all speak English
Most of our football players are very good at speaking different languages since they all play abroad (UK, Spain, Germany
I think they speak both Dutch and French on the pitch since they can all understand both
No idea, I really don't care about football, so, I'm unfortunatly not the best person to whom such a question should be asked ;-)
I started going alone to school by bike or on foot when I was about ten
This was in the Dutroux era
It was only a kilometre though, in a mid-sized city
Not well, I’ve heard some medieval Dutch (van den vos Reynaerde and Walewein) and I can understand it a little but not much at all
The general sounds have stayed the same but most other things have changed
I think the transition from unreadable to slightly understandable is around the transition from early middle ages to late, probably not entirely coincidental with the growth of cities after the 1000s. Trying to read the original manuscripts is downright impossible though, the alphabet also changed quite a lot
I find "Karel ende Edelgast" from 1270 pretty intelligible, but the text is from Brabant and so am I.
I understand a lot of Walloon but it's hard to trace back it's history
We have some origins from around 900 and it was the main language until WWI
Unfortunately it's hard to find written proofs (Latin became the used language instead of Celtic languages)  so we don't know how it was originally
As someone who speaks West Flemish, those old Dutch fragments are understandable
It's like reading a text from another West Flemish speaker who is from a different region
You can understand most of it but some words are just different
Edit: I read it again and the last sentence however is pretty difficult to understand
to me Karel en de Elegast was quite understandable, but mileage varies i suppose
any older than that is just a different language tough
I don't think it's all that fair to use the Hebban olla vogola text to judge how comprehensible Old Dutch was, after all it was a form of old West Flemish and all of you still struggle to understand even the modern forms of it :p
&#x200B;
that being said, coming from West Flanders the text is perfectly understandable over here
Icelandic has got a lot of sound changes, like any language, but they are so consistent, which is why modern Icelandic text looks so much like Old Norse
An obvious example is the Icelandic plosives: they all became voiceless
The g also turned into a bunch of different sounds
Also the difference between i and y is gone
I think Vikings would still be able to communicate with modern Icelandic people
They could also somewhat communicate with the Saxons that arrived in England, after all
Yes, you are right
There has been a lot of dialect levelling on the mainland, whereas Iceland has experienced less of this simply because it is so small in comparison
Yes ! I don't understand how people keep mixing 'to agree' with 'etre accord' when the verb 'agreer' exists in French with a similar meaning
In Dutch it is both correct
"Een foto nemen" (take) or "Een foto maken" (make) are both correct standard Dutch, but in Flemish (Belgian non-standard Dutch) we often say "Een foto trekken" (pull/draw/take)
That one is less common here, but true
I never heard that one before
Bokken en kemels worden al eens geschoten in Vlaanderen
Soms ook in een franse colère, of uit z'n krammen
Iets kan ik ook een lichaamsdeel schieten
Maar een foto ? Niet echt
In Dutch that would probably translate to 'momenteel' or 'op het moment' but 'actuel' would translate to 'actueel'.
> until our teachers told us to shut the hell up
Belgian teachers can relate
Anyways, I went to the USA last year and it was literally full of Dutch people, it was crazy, I heard Dutch literally EVERYWHERE
We were visiting this national park and I was talking to my mom (in Flemish aka Belgian Dutch) and suddenly these 2 Belgian teenage girl screamed “OMG, ARE YOU BELGIAN
” in Flemish
We were like “uhm yeah
” and they continued screaming: “FINALLY
The states is literally FULL of Dutch people, we’re so happy to finally encounter fellow Belgians
” Weird but funny, also gave us some strange looks from Dutchies
Not sure, but I think it was Zion
>And also Asereje by Las Ketchup
Here it's know as "The Las Ketchup Song"
Yes, the things mentioned are : date of birth, sex, nationality (and names obviously)
Ours cards are electronic, so, there is a chip with more informations that a computer with card reader can access to
In Belgium, having an ID card is compulsory/mandatory by law as soon as you are 16, and legally, you can't go out without it
We have one, it's basically a very neutral looking piece of plastic with some data, a chip, and some other security features on it
Sex, not gender
They are different things
In between the __17th__ and __18th__ century Ghent was the biggest city (if we are just looking at the region of current day Belgium)
Somewhere in the middle of __19th century__ this changed
After that I don't know up until __1983__, during that year we fused a lot of towns and cities together and Antwerp has been the biggest ever since, as it instantly multiplied its population by a factor of __2
5__.
That is if we are going by __city__ and not __metropolitan area__
Currently the biggest __cities__ are: Antwerp > Ghent > Charleroi > Liège > Brussels
By __metropolitan area__ it would be  Brussels > Antwerp > Ghent ...
Edit: formating and clarity
1600 : Ghent
1700 : Antwerp
1800 : Antwerp
1900 : Antwerp
Today : Antwerp
(For the record the 5 biggest cities today are Antwerp, Ghent, Charleroi, Liège and Brussels)
Paris was the largest city in Europe full stop for most of the middle ages
Looked it up today
Still dwarfed by Chinese cities at the time though
Meanwhile, Antwerp had
105 000 citizens in 1567
84 000 in 1584
And 46 000 in 1591
IIRC the language/dialect spoken in the early 17th century in Amsterdam was Antwerpian
Antwerpen was never part of the Netherlands to begin with, it was part of the Duchy of Brabant ... Your country didn't exist until 1581
Yea, this is one of those questions of bureaucracy mostly
Recently learned that say, Tokyo is basically several cities in one and all that and can hardly be called one city
If we sort the [agglomerations] by population, it is :
Brussels > Antwerp > Liège > Ghent > Charleroi > ...
1000 - 1550: Mostly Ghent, with peaks for Ieper around 1250 and Bruges around 1400
1550: Antwerp
1600: Brussels
1700: Probably Antwerp (due to the French bombardment on Brussels five years earlier), but both Brussels and Ghent would overtake it again soon
1800: Ghent
1900: Brussels or Antwerp, hard to say which of the two had a larger agglomeration (Antwerp was the larger municipality)
Today: Brussels (although Antwerp is the largest single municipality)
Liège came close a few times, but I can't find any evidence to argue it was ever the largest city of modern day Belgium
It might've been Tournai in the early Middle Ages
>Antwerpen was never part of the Netherlands to begin with
Except much later ofcourse
but that doesn't matter to their point though
They said it changed when a significant part of Antwep moved to Amsterdam, they didn't say Antwerp was the biggest before that
Fun fact: kuttenberg means cunt mountain in Dutch
Haha
>16th century
But sadly the Spanish had to ruin it
The order is true but the numbers seem wierd when you use the Belgian definition
Antwerp was about 1
2m and and Brussels 1
6m in 2017
The city of Brussels is rather small actually
People just confuse the region of Brussels and neighbouring towns of Brussels with the city of Brussels
Molenbeek for example is often denoted as part of Brussels and if you are talking about the metropolitan area or the region of Brussels, then this is true
But it isn't part of the city of Brussels
The city of Brussels is a rather small municipality
It represents only a fraction of the agglomeration
No, I dislike when they appropriate things that are not theirs
The Belgian definition
[Here] is the source of citypopulation
[Here] an article of the Cairn about Belgian agglomerations
Both only in French sadly
Tbh, I either never heard of it or I forgot about it
I'm from Antwerp and we learned about the 80 year war mostly through they eyes of the city of Antwerp and as a war between protestantism and catholicism
No not really
After the initial revolts that took place all over the 17 Provinces, the most southern provinces, in a pretty logical manner, ended up siding with the Spanish after a while since the roots of the revolt simply didn't run as deep there and they where predominantly catholic after all
That's the way we learned it as far as I can remember
Probably with a small surgue during the Napoleon era and then the small part where we fused with the Netherlands again
I'm Flemish, my French isn't good enough to read those sources properly
>The Belgian definition
Every country holds different definitions for agglomerations
For example, in 2011 when using the European defenition there was a massive agglomeration that contained a big chunk of Flanders (including Antwerp), Brussels and some linear settlements all the way into Wallonia
It had a population of 5
2m, because they were all connected through linear settlements
Edit: [source for the above]
In Belgium we define two types:
*Big cities* and *regional cities*. (I'm not going to define the properly here)
The five cities we mentioned earlier are the only ones seen as big cities while Louvain, Bruges and Verviers (for example) are seen as regional cities
If you use the Belgian definitions and the population numbers of each municapality from the 2017 for each of the five "Big cities". You get that Antwerp has 1
2m and Brussels 1
6m and the rest below 1m.
You definitely just forgot about it
The Union of Atrecht are basicaly the catholic regions that sided with the Spanish, while the Union of Utrecht were the protestant regions at the time of their creation in 1579
Most regions of present day Flanders were part of the Union of Utrecht, but obviously the situation quickly changed after the Fall of Antwerp in 1585
Yeah I looked it up before my comment, but I don't recall ever hearing about it before
At first I even thought Atrecht was a typo
I feel like we're having a little misunderstanding here
Like you and I both said, the initial revolts took place all over the 17 Provinces with some regions more fiercely involved than others
When I was talking about the 'most southern provinces' I was referring to the county of Artois and the county of Hainaut AKA the counties that made up the Union of Atrecht, which our Dutch friend was talking about
Flanders and Brabant were part of the Union of Utrecht but did indeed later get conquered by the Spanish and thus became predominantly catholic as most of the protestant population fled north whereas Hainaut and Artois were already more catholic to start with
So yeah, understandable misunderstanding I guess
I should've been more clear with the whole southern provinces thing given the end-result of the war
Haha yeah it's one of the main reasons I really remember it
Always thought it was kind of funny that you have two battling factions called the Union of Atrecht and the Union of Utrecht
But hey maybe you did indeed just not learn it
I thought you might have because I live in Sint-Niklaas so we also had a pretty large focus on the things that happened in Antwerp back then, but we still learned about it
Figured the programs might've been similar
I honestly don't know how it began initially
I had an American friend in the South of France on holiday when I was 8 or so I talked English with already
Games kept improving my English
By age 13 I was reading English books(looked for something to read in the car and found an English book) and by age 16 I was on Ventrilo leading raids in Karazhan with most being surprised I wasn't British later on
I generally don't remember learning English in general except for a single word
A loading screen for Age of Empires II contained "plains". Through context I figured out what it meant(and that it wasn't planes) and it stuck with me ever since
But that's the only English word I can remember consciously learning
Since I was 6 years old I already played some games on the Nintendo
Those were in English, but tbh I barely knew any English
When I was 13, I started getting English at school
At the same time I got a PS4 and played games on there that were in English
I started watching some Dutch YouTubers, but they use a lot of English vocabulary
Like a year later I started watching English YouTubers and I started using the internet way more
Programs weren't dubbed so things shows like Dinosaurs or Third Rock From The Sun helped with a basic understanding
Plus video games, they weren't localised (so no Dutch version), dad got me and my brother GTA III when I was 8 so
Around age 10 (around '05) my older brother showed me Runescape
I played it, introduced it at my school even
Good times
That shit taught me so much English (and real life skills like don't get scammed or follow strangers into the wildy)
My parents are from different countries, one Flemish and the other from Pakistan
They spoke English with each other thinking I didn't understand
It's weird how babies work
They just absorb whatever you throw at them
So I have very little memory of actually learning English
I do have a vague memory where I'm just beginning to learn to read and my parents hand me a text in English to see if I can read it
I just learnt how to read Dutch but I was already reading English fluently as well just by deduction of what it must sound like
English has a lot of phonemes that are pronounced different than they're written, so that was a process but still
I basically figured it all out at a very early age
Television in Flanders is never dubbed, always subtitled
Spending hours after school watching The Fresh Prince, Friends, The Simpsons, Full House, etc helped
Because of that my accent is completely American to the point where Americans assume I'm American sometimes
Then there's the internet which consumed whole chunks of my life, and which is I believe 90% in English
(I was reading this article about languages on the internet that says: "a survey published by Unesco in 2008 found that [98% of the internet’s web pages ] published in ] [12 languages] and more than [half of them are in English] -[The many languages missing from the internet ] Miguel Trancozo Trevino 15th April 2020 )
So am I a native speaker
My parents' pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary was terrible but I do indicate native speaker on forms and cv's because it's been part of me since before I can remember
I don't know, what's the rule there
I watched a lot of television as a kid
We don't dub programs and most of the shows are American
I think the Simpsons really taught me to speak English
I'm not bad at languages and by the time I had my first English lesson (14 I think
) I had enough knowledge to just fill in the book in a week and be bored for the rest of the year
I also enjoy reading, and enjoy reading in English
I think about 60% of the books I own are English
Very rarely does a writing style not resonate with me, most of the time I enjoy it pretty good
Reddit did helpt me to realize that it's not easy to express yourself fully in a foreign language
There's a lot of nuance that you can't express or sometimes I'm writing a sentence and I notice that my train of thought doesn't really translate very well
English is funny in that way
I guess it kinda started around 10 years old cuz i used to play runescape
Didnt have english classes until i was 13 tho, went on to a bachelor as english teacher
Didnt finish it tho
For me what worked the best was games and subtitles
I learned more english from the old x-men cartoon then from anything else, and after that gaming helped
I'm told my older sisters and brother taught me how to read a bit when they did
Reading slowly,  i couldn't read all the subtitles
But i compared the first words odd every line to what the people on tv were saying
And that was that
Must have been about 4 or 5
Once my mom found out,  she stimulated the hell out of it and got me some kids books and stuff
Subtitles are the best
English started in highschool at around 13-14 years old but I was already fluent because I grew up playing Guildwars which forced me to learn English and ask my dad to translate certain things
Best way to learn a language is by using it constantly
I even followed my courses in English even though I had the choice to follow them in dutch
TLDR: in Belgium it's possible to do erasmus to another school in Belgium
&#x200B;
I'm Belgian and our country has different language communities  which have separate governments and education is under their jurisdiction so it is possible en done by some but you can go to the opposite language university then your original
giving you an erasmus in your own country
But it can be worse Brussels is a 2 language zone so you can go there to a dutch speaking uni and go on erasmus to a french speaking one without changing city
in case of the VUB and ULB it's even on the same campus .
I did my Erasmus on Svalbard
Interesting place for sure to spend almost half a year
I did my Erasmus in Umeå (in the north of Sweden) during the winter months
It sure was an experience, didn't see a lot of sun in the beginning :)
I was also thinking about this
So surreal ahah
Well you would want to go to a university that offers courses which fit your program, no
For example I'm getting a masters degree in Biology with a thesis oriented toward molecular biology / genetics
If I would go on Erasmus I'd choose a place that has a strong molecular biology program
Sure you want to go to a nice place you haven't seen before, but you still want to pursue your educational goals right
Also Erasmus outside of Europe is a lot less subsidized so it costs you personally a lot more money
atleast that is kinda  different experience
belgium is a very small country and it is a full legit erasmus
In most cases you are but the KU Leuven offers some courses in English and those are usually packed to the brim with Erasmus students
The only thing that died over there was my bank account ;)
Another fun fact: They actually do have a cemetery in Longyearbyen
It's only symbolic though and no bodies are buried over there
Last time they tried this the bodies started to reappear on the surface after a few months because the permafrost pushes everything upwards
Fun times assured
I went to Barentsburg (Russian settlement) and Pyramiden (an abandoned town with only 6 inhabitants left)
Besides that I also did a lot of activities in and outside of Longyearbyen
I gotta admit, it did feel weird to know that you’re living in the northernmost town in the world and that this was basically the end of civilization with only wilderness around you
Kinda cool tho :D
I think the reason I don't really get that might be because I travel a lot by default
I can take a month off and decide to take the camper from Belgium to the Black Woods for a bit, travel to Switzerland and end up somewhere in the South of Spain
These things aren't really an experience for me
They're just life
Being "somewhere else" just doesn't do much for me
Speaking as somebody who could wait with graduating and everything(sister just did at 27, there simply was no hurry or pressure on her to do so, she took a break for 2 years to raise dogs for example) there are plenty of people who can't exactly go and do that as well
I fully agree, but then an Erasmus doesn't seem like the best way for me since it's still centered around education
If travel is what you really want, then follow your dreams and travel
You can indeed always focus on your career, so grab the opportunities you have in your 20ies :) whether it's Erasmus, gap year, volunteering, ... I for example took a gap year between my bachelors and masters and made 3 large trips to South America and Asia
Sure, not the same as living there, but a lot of time to go around and explore
I just wanted to make clear with my original comment why some people might choose a destination that doesn't seem as interesting
It doesn't work well for individuals, but you can often guess where a group is from
If you see people with very outdoorsy clothes and deuter backpacks, those are germans
I'm pretty sure I can spot a Dutchie just on sight
But I'm never going to be able to prove it, because usually you hear them coming before they are in visual range
You can tell I'm more Germanic because of my face but then you still couldn't say if I'm from Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria
Purely by looks you can't do much more than guess imo
[This] shows average faces of women around the world
The western and southern european ones (nationalities of which I've seen many people) all made me go 'oh yeah, she really does look like she's from there'.
Came here to look if a Finn left this kind of reply
We truly are easily recognizable
Round face, pale skin, light hair, a certain face structure, similar to people in Eastern Europe imo
We look really young too, something which I hope I will someday be happy about
Really
To me, Dutch people are quite easy to tell apart ... they have Dutch faces
Lol I feel personally attacked  yeah I guess round faces lack edges the same way edgy faces lack roundness
But I don't think any face "lacks" anything
Flanders as well tbh
Oh okay thank you  there are just lots of people who feel insecure about their round face because it makes them look so much younger
That can be really annoying sometimes
My GF and I recently switched over to bar soaps instead of liquid soap in plastic containers
You can find bar soaps for shampoo and conditioner as well
ie Lush
The reason why mostly supermarkets selling bread use paper bags with plastic windows (for lack of a better word) is that cashiers can see what's inside without having to open the bag
Benefit : not opening is faster ==> more clients per hour ==> less cashiers needed ==> savings on salary
The bread is fresh in supermarkets, so no barcode
You cut the bread and put it in a bag yourself
You have different bags for different sizes of bread but not for different types of bread so the prices can still differ
"To pull your plan" both exists in Belgian Dutch 'zijn plan trekken' and in Belgian French 'tirer son plan' (not sure about the German speaking community)
It means something like 'to manage', 'to fend for oneself', 'to figure it out for oneself'
Examples:
*-Someone has a plan to do something but you don't agree with it and don't want to join
You can tell them 'pull your plan'. Basically 'do it yourself', 'figure it our for yourself'.*
*-You have to go to a place you've never been to before and you friend is worried "Are you sure you're going by yourself, I can join you if you want
" "No, no need, I'll pull my plan, I'll be fine
" \[I'll figure it out\]*
*-Two moms who's kids were sent out to do something
One mom is very worried
The other says: "Hey don't worry, they'll pull their plan
They're old enough and they're with two
" \[They'll figure it out, they'll manage, they can fend for themselves\]*
&#x200B;
We even have a noun for the person "een plantrekker' (not sure if a French word exists for this)
Someone who can figure things out for themselves and always finds a way to get things done or make things work in their advantage
\[ Sometimes it could be used in a negative way to tell that someone always finds a way out of their responsibilities/duties
We also have the idea of 'A (good) Belgian pulls their plan
' or 'In Belgium we pull our plan
'. So we have the idea that a Belgian person can generally figure a problem out for themselves
I'm not sure if this is used in the Netherlands or not and if it's even used all over Flanders, but where I live there's the expression: **It's like an angel pissing on my tongue/it's like an angel pissing in my mouth
** *(Als een engeltje die in je mond/op je tong piest)* It means that something tastes really good
I hate this one so much
I have a vivid imagination and whenever my mom uses this expression, I just cringe, it seems disgusting
**Promise makes debt/promise creates debt** *(belofte maakt schuld)*: If you make a promise, you need to keep it
**Even accounts make good friends
** (Not sure if that translation was any good, the original: *Effen rekeningen maken goede vrienden
*) On a financial level, it's good to have clear agreements with your friends, it's best if neither side is in debt with the other one, that's the best way to keep a good friendship
My favorite is probably "staring the cat out of the tree". It is used when someone waits instead of taking action
I can add that "Das ist mir Wurst/wurscht
" also has a Dutch counterpart in "Het zal me worst wezen", which means the same thing
Parler Anglais comme une vache Espagnole really made me laugh
I didn't need to read the meaning of the expression, it is so clear and beautifully worded
I never realized how weird this was
Haha love how literally you translated it
I'm a pro plantrekker and proud of it
Yeah, I didn't know how to translate it but I thought that going litteral here would be the best for this thread
Though 'pulling your plan' sounds freaking weird in English, it doesn't make any sense
I think in France you say 'se débrouiller' instead
I'm not French speaking myself so I don't come into contact enough with French variations to really know where people use what
But I think it's not that strange that it differs
As a Flemish Dutch speaker there are so many differences between the Dutch in Belgium and in the Netherlands, so it wouldn't surprise me at all that there are also many differences between Wallonian French and French French
I also read somewhere that 'tirer son plan' came from the Flemish expression, so influence of Flemish Dutch on French in Belgium
Like I've heard French speaking people in Brussels use the word 'dikkenek' (meaning braggart), which is obviously a Dutch word, not sure if it's also used in Wallonia
I also heard that the expression 'à tantôt' is Belgian French (meaning: see you later today), maybe you could confirm/deny if this is used in France
Haha yes
As a Flemish teacher in a school in Molenbeek, I yell: 'Tirez votre plan
' alot when they keep talking while I try to explain something
Just translated it literally, had no idea if they used it in French
I'm not a 100% sure, because I'm not a native French speaker, maybe some Wallonian scrolling along can confirm or deny
But I think in Belgium when saying  à tantôt  it implies that you'll see each other again on that same day
[Het Groene Boekje ftw]
Yes,always the anglo-saxon people outside Europe
They thought that I speak belgian haha
I've only met one guy in my life that was really aware that French was spoken somewhere else than France
He was a salesman in NYC
He even asked me about the differences in "Belgian French" vs French
Most people ask me what does "Belgian" sound like because they've never heard it
A lot of people don't even know Belgium is a country and since I'm a French-Speaker, they just say "ah oui oui baguette are you from Paris
At least equally commonly they inform me that in Belgium in fact multiple languages are spoken
Some other misconceptions that are rather frequent:
French is the majority language but there is a small Dutch minority
French and German are the only languages of Belgium
The Dutch, French and German communities are equal in size
All of even most Belgians are keen on ripping the country apart
Belgium is a part of either the Netherlands or France
By relief, this one is uncommon
TIL people also speak German in Luxembourg
As a Belgian I feel like I should have known this
I'm astonished that people thought more about German than Dutch when it's coming to our languages
Like I mean, I don't even know a single german translations to our cities !
Not even close
Every time they measure the amount of people in favour are under 20%.
The German community in Belgium is smaller than some communities that aren't officially recognised
Belgium is so complicated, man
Just a few villages surrounding Brussels
That's a disingenuous way to put it
There is a majority government that would work in every province but Antwerp
The parties refuse to do it because they argue there needs to be a majority in Antwerp
Useless polticial games
It's just that Wallonia ussually votes left and Flanders votes right
Also, the biggest party in Flanders now refuses to step into a government with a Flemish minority of seats
(Which makes sense imo because Flanders has by far the mayority of people)
> Just a few villages surrounding Brussels
Is where there is a *majority* of francophones
I can't speak for the rest of Flanders but you'll find a decent amount of native francophones in the province of Antwerp as well
Also some small region in West-Flanders
Also a dutch region in Walloon in the East somewhere
> Also, the biggest party in Flanders now refuses to step into a government with a Flemish minority of seats
(Which makes sense imo because Flanders has by far the mayority of people)
If you want to  count that srt of things, the last governement had only one wallon governement and was definitely not representative of wallonia
I say we accept it because its a *federal governement* not a coalitions of the régions
Why is the biggest minority so important
The only place where the coalition without the nationalist doesn't have a majority is Antwerp
Why is one province more important than the others
The previous government with the nationalists didn't have a majority in most provinces
It wasn't an issue then
No I mean the villages surrounding the Capital region
I don't know their opinion about it, but flanders sure as hell wouldn't allow it
Those communes were part cause of a major political crisis for years, in fairly recent memory and caused our sixth state reform
[More info on wiki]
>you'll find a decent amount of native francophones in the province of Antwerp as well
I live there
Its probably the province with the least francophones since there is no border with Wallonia
In waht Antwerp cities do you think these francohphones live then
Exactly
The previous government didn't have a majority in any French majority provinces
The current coalition created this week has a majority everywhere except Antwerp
Oh I know I'm just saying one of the reasons why it takes so long right now
I personally don’t like it there, but Knokke is pretty well known (especially amongst rich people)
They tried (with the emphasis on tried) turning it into Saint Tropez 2
Keith Haring used to go there a lot, though
If you want tall old grey buildings right at the edge of the sea then Belgium has a treat for you
Depressing as fuck
Yet the beaches are loaded with people on any somewhat warm day
Yeah, our "kust" is not really anything to look at
But the childhood memories make it treasurable
The Westhoek is nice too
Zeeland is where the Kiting's at
I go to Brouwersdam anytime conditions allow
Thanks for having me :)
You got that right :)
[Envoi] by Absinthe Minded is definitely a banger
I dont know if it's known outside Belgium, it should be
That or [Adolescence Blues ] by Equal Idiots
Edit: added links
For me, that would be [Yevgueni - Nieuwe meisjes (new girls)] It's has a really catchy folkish tune that I really like
Also [Faces on TV - Love / Dead]
Singing in English: Equal idiots (garage rock)
Singing in Dutch: zwangere guy (rap)
Singing in French: Stromae (mainly hiphop/electro)
Singing in German: I don’t know
I really like Loïc Nottet
He has a very unique voice
Maybe you know him because he performed at the Eurovision song contest in 2015 with [Rhythm Inside]
Every song of him is different
He sings what he likes, mostly in English
Some examples:
[Heartbreaker] (pop song)
[Million eyes] (powerballad maybe
I don't know)
[Mr/Mme] (French chanson)
[Candy] (an entire Halloween musical)
Just to name a few
Wow I had totaly forgotten about Envoi by Absinthe Minded
Thanks for bringing that now nostalgic song back to me
I hate to admit I've never heard of any of these but I'm looking them up right now
Check out Your Highness if you like Stoner (metal)
Oh great
Yeah, I know the drummer a bit (he's my tattoo artist) and they have their own beer (brewed by the guitarist) as well
They're awesome guys
But looks like you know a lot about it then if you even came to Desertfest :)
Antwerp and Ghent
It's like cats and dogs
I lived in Ghent for two years as someone from Antwerp and I was looked upon
I know it happens the other way around as well
The province of Antwerp vs the province of West-Flanders
Most West Flemish people can't stand people from Antwerp and vice versa
I personally have no problem with either
Not sure about the fiercest, but I know the citizens of Aalst and Dendermonde
While they're more frenemies than enemies, it's been going on for 800 years
Aalst is mainly known for its onions and annual carnival, in which it isn't shy from controversies
Dendermonde is mainly known for its decennial "Ros Beiaard" parade, in which a giant horse puppet is paraded through the city with four "heemskinderen" (four brothers born consecutively and city natives) on its back
2020 would have hosted a parade, but it got cancelled due to COVID-19
At least every few years, the rivalry gets the news
There's a whole chronicle detailing the rivalry here (in Dutch, but Google Translate will help, if you're interested): [
Some highlights: both cities have produced a whole load of songs mocking the other one
Aalst has its own parody version of the Ros Beiaard, which is often used during their carnaval
One city stealing the other's horse, the other city listing one's horse on eBay, students of both cities occupying each other's monuments, city representatives getting desinfected at visits in the other city (pre-COVID, people
), ... Whatever you name, it has probably happened
Last year most recently, a truckload full of onions was dumped on a Dendermonde roundabout in the middle of the night
By now, the rivalry is rooted in tradition to such an extent that the cities have made joint statements to honour the tradition and keep it alive as much as possible
Man, I love being European at moments like this
I think Ghent vs Bruges is fiercer and dates back far longer
I honestly get the impression a lot of people talk shit about Antwerp but Antwerp doesn't really care
It's like when Samuel L Jackson was in Be for some movie and he posted a picture of de Grote Markt in Antwerp
Everybody on Instagram or whatever was shouting he had to come to Ghent, because it's nicer
If it were the other way around, nobody from Antwerp would've said anything, pretty sure about that
I live in Antwerp, originally from the area between Brussels and Leuven, and whenever someone says Antwerp = arrogant I just have to mention people from Ghent aren't any better tbh
Feels more like Ghent against Antwerp
Antwerp doesn't really care about Ghent
I'd say Dendermonde vs
Aalst is much fiercer rivalry
I would generalize this to Antwerp against the rest of Flanders (exept Limburg, I mean seriously do people still believe the lies that it exists
Antwerp is the city, the rest is parking commes to mind here
And here I am
Half Kempenaar & half West Vlaming
De avatar van Vlaanderen
Hate us cuz they aint us
I understand, I was very happy living in Ghent
Living in Antwerp wasn't the same afterwards, but I stayed for love
Same thing has happened with Anderlecht
And here I was, trying to defend you guys :p
Like you said, Antwerp doesn't care
I've lived my whole life in Antwerp and this is the first I heard of a rivalry between us and Ghent
Sure I've heard about other cities disliking us, but I never cared enough about that
I like parking jokes too much
I don't know what their reasons are for disliking Antwerp
Maybe it's because outside of Brussels (capital region, not the city itself) Antwerp is probably the only real "big city" we have in this small country
I don't know
But it's something that starts to annoy me sometimes
Whenever I say I live in Antwerp, everyone immediately has to yell "aaantwaarpe" or "tstad" or whatever they think is funny in a very bad impression of Antwerps, ignoring the fact that first I live here and I'm not from here and second: no one cares
>I don't know what their reasons are for disliking Antwerp
Maybe it's because outside of Brussels (capital region, not the city itself) Antwerp is probably the only real "big city" we have in this small country
I don't know
I think it's because of the Antwerp mentality
The big mouth, small heart
We come across as arrogant because we don't give a fuck about what others think and we have no problem saying that
That doesn't mean we think less of others, but we think primarily about ourselves first
>But it's something that starts to annoy me sometimes
Whenever I say I live in Antwerp, everyone immediately has to yell "aaantwaarpe" or "tstad" or whatever they think is funny in a very bad impression of Antwerps, ignoring the fact that first I live here and I'm not from here and second: no one cares
Ye, if it's done in a funny way I can appreciate it
But sometimes it's just people doing it because they can, but I guess that's also Antwerp
Every city has those, no need to feel ashamed of them
>I live here and I'm not from here
Everyone can become an Antwerpenaar
For plenty animation movies in Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, we use a Flemish dub rather than the Dutch dub yeah
Don’t want cheesy Dutch accents indoctrinated in our 7 year olds
Some animated movies even have complete separate dubbed versions: one in Flemish Dutch and one in Dutch Dutch
I really dislike the delivery of the Latin lines
Obviously none of the actors is native in the language and it just sounds like they're mindlessly saying the lines they studied
EDIT: I want to clarify I don't dislike the Latin from an objective standpoint, as far as I can tell there are no mistakes in grammar or vocabulary, I just believe they don't speak their lines like an actor would in English/any other language, there is almost no stress or intonation in the words
I'm also watching that with my parents, it's really nice to see how the German would be translated into our dutch oftentimes you can translate it directly and it sounds less fluid and older but still very understandable
It's a nice way to see that
I can't imagine how Latin might sound to you, it's made to be spoken the Italian way so it sounds different than how I might pronounce it, I personally quite like that they didn't have the Latin pronounced from an English standpoint or anything (my mother teaches Latin and she's absolutely taken)
With pleasure
Idk though, it's been heavily researched and it seemed pretty good to me, my mother teaches Latin and she loves it
Maybe you're confused because you're used to it being delivered with your accent (not an attack just wondering)
Right now I believe it sounds weird to me because most of the works I translated were written in dactylic hexameter, which obviously influences the stress in words and stuff
I think that's a really interesting point, I've started watching it with my family particularly because of the languages and since the Latin I'd a lot further away then German is to our Dutch I never really saw it that way
I'd agree though if the languages we're reversed it'd possibly feel very off to me
Dialects are basically dead in Wallonia, everybody uses the same grammar, and writes the words the same way (a dialect is : different grammar and different spelling /orthograph)
We have different accents though, but an accent isn't a dialect
In this regard we are very much the same as the Netherlands
Every town has its own dialect
But sadly enough most smaller dialect are going extinct with only older generations still speaking them
The bigger dialects from large cities are still spoken by most people though
In Belgium even more trust me
I recognise difference in dialects 10km away
It's the same here (in Flanders at least)
And I swear it's really hard or impossible for people from West Flanders to understand people from Limburg
Behalve west-vlaanderen
I'm 17 and I still speak my dialect at home and man it's so much more fun to talk in dialect then in Standard Dutch or even just *tussentaal*.
Here is West-Flanders the dialect is still going strong, though it's slowly fading away
Which is a shame honestly
An accent isn't a dialect though, an accent doesn't change grammar and doesn't change how words are written
You'd be surprised how accurate that is
Limburgish was a different language historically
It didn't evolve from Dutch, it evolved independently
That might be part of the reason
I have a Brabantian dialect from the province of Antwerp and I can understand all Flemish dialects but that may be partly because the modern language is mostly based on Brabantian dialects
It is sad indeed, I have heard some West-Flemish in various videos on Youtube, and I find it rather nice, I prefer it to "normal" Dutch
But at least it is still spoken, Walloon dialects are nearly extinct at this point
Some old people can still speak and still do, some schools exist to teach it, but it isn't widespread, ressources are neither easy to find nor plentiful
So, while some actions have been launched to save it, I don't think it is very successful, and there are few incentives to learn it
I speak a mix of Brabantian and East Flemish dialect and I can ussually understand what West Flemish or Limburgish people are talking about, but I can't understand every single word
Ussually yes, although I know someone who can't inderstand them so he talks English to them which can lead to very awkward moments
I speak Vlaams
Giesbaargs, a mix of East-Flemish and Brabantian
A different accent alone doesn't make a dialect
If you speak the standard/official version of your language but just have a different accent than the TV and radio version of your language, you don't speak another dialect
A dialect is nearly another language : it has a different way to write words, it had a sometimes different grammmar
Yeah sure you miss a word here and there but to me it's pretty understandable still
I certainly don't deny that an accent is an integral part of a dialect, just saying that a different accent alone isn't enough to say "it's another dialect". For example, in Belgium, people in Liège, Charleroi and Namur might all have a different accent than mine, but i don't consider their accent to form another dialect
And while Belgian French might have some slight differences with French French, the differences are too few and not strong enough to say Belgian French is a full dialect
It is a variety of French, rather than a dialect ; people from France and Belgium can understand each others without any problem, and sometimes without realising the person ins't French or isn't Belgian, despite the possible different accents
Well, thank you for the nuance you brought, I shall precise in the future than in my country, a different accent isn't considered a dialect, but that this is how we see things locally
I bookmarked the video for later
Well, thank you for bringing the position of linguists on the matter
In the language I speak, we don't consider the different accents to be dialects, even if for linguistics they might be
It just doesn't really fit how we view what a different dialect is
For example, it isn't like West-Flemish vs standards Dutch, which are written differently and have a somehow different grammar, or High-German/standards German vs Austrian German
We might have different accents, sometimes a slightly different vocabulary, but the differences are too small compared to what you have with German or the various Norwegian dialects
But of course, this isn't in accordance with the linguistics' definition
Somehow the blame for most things the EU fucks up ends up in Brussels, even tho politically speaking, Belgium only wields minor power within the EU
We don't plan this shit, we just allow them to plan it here
Edit: I know that it's just an English referencing structure
But that doesn't make it okay, because it makes less intelligent people take it literally nonetheless
I'm pretty sure Trump didn't mean the EU when he called Brussels a hellhole, but I have a pretty good guess where he got the idea
We don't get blamed, but they got the fame
French fries are not French, they are Belgian
Gosh, I hate it so much when they say "Brussels this, Brussels that
blahblah" as if we did enforce some shit on them
Especially the Brits obviously
Ok fair point let me edit that
I can assure you they know our beer and chocolat exists
Remembering our fries can't be that hard
Yes, yes it does make me feel good :)
Poor Walloons though
From what other people commented it seems that the fries were invented in France, but it were the Belgians that turned it into the fries we eat today
My whole life is a lie
Does Belgium even exist
How can I know anything anyone ever told me is real now
Yes, thank you
I have only recieved this article from the University of Liege maybe 10 times today
Boooi French fries are everywhere over here
Ever heared of a 'frituur'? It's sort of a fast-food restaurant where the fries are the most important part of what you order
NASA didn't invent the rocket yet they get all the fame for getting people on the moon
Also just not true
Having some vague link to another ethnicity doesn't suddenly make you non-Russian when you're born in Russia and your mother tongue is Russian
Stalin was Georgian though
It's the classic and fantastic technique of "Divide et impera", "divide and conquer". The Romans used it as well
You don't actually expect Americans to know the difference between the Arabic and Greek alphabet
Some of them propably think Greeks still build shrines to Zeus
Will admit: I ALMOST made that mistake between the 2 alphabets as well one time
Almost
Yes, that's my point: there is a huge difference
But there are people that haven't seen anything but their own alphabet for most of their early life so when they see 2 'foreign' alphabets they assume both are the same thing
Or don't bother to care about the difference
If the Brexit had been a well thought-trough plan with a whole explanation of 'this is why leaving is a good idea and that is what we will do IF you vote yes' and that plan made sense than I would have had no problem with leave-voters
But that's not what happend
The Brittish government was litterally like 'hey look we don't really have a plan or anything but we just wondered if you chaps would like to take a wild leap and leave the EU
We don't know how or what we're gonna do afterwards, but sometimes a man just has to do something crazy amIright
' AND PEOPLE IN THE UK ACTUALLY WENT WITH IT
And look in what sort of a mess we are now: The EU and UK are litterally at each others troat because nobody in the Brittish parliament knew what to do if the leave-voters actually won so they just decided to be a bitch to the EU
It's part of biology class in 8th grade but during that grade we cover both animals(7th was plants), their skeleton(think where the wrist is in the leg of a horse or where the legs in whales are), evolution and more importantly, all the "systems" in the body
Including the digestion system
(also the reproductive system so this is actually also sex ed basically)
So what happens if we combine those
We cut open a big flemish rabbit of course
(if you don't know that rabbit look it up, it's as big as a rather large dog)
So yea, during biology class after going over the digestion system in humans we cut open a rabbit in class
Blew with a straw into it's lungs, cut open the diaphragm and see what happens, disembowel it, etc
Damn that shit smells
We do have art history in Belgium in some departments
Between 3rd and 6th grade we tend to have all sort of "world orientation" subjects
Often combined with a trip
Instruments in the orchestra
Firefighters
Water
Butterflies
etc
etc
Art, normal life of ancient Greece and Roman people, etc
was also touched upon and we covered a lot of art in history classes later on
As the other guy said, Belgium by 11th grade has 100's of directions but I'm not going to count those because those aren't "normal" in most cases
Like I did software and IT in 11th grade so I had 5 hours of programming, 5 hours of computer hardware, 1 hour of math involving irrational numbers, etc
In Flanders, this is not a separate course, but part of the general Dutch classes
Apparently this is not the case in the Netherlands, poor souls
I mean, maybe it's not because of those lessons(though they're not a separate subject) but I'm pretty good in sniffing out bullshit or knowing when something is historical or fictional because of it
If those are related they should be fucking mandatory world wide, maybe we wouldn't have presidents not recognizing fucking satire
About 8000 French students and 40 000 German students learn Dutch, mostly in Hauts-de-France, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia
It is also taught in Brazilian highschools that are close to Suriname
The sad part is that it isn't even mandatory in Wallonia
That's how much they care about our language :(
We have it in catholic schools
It's honestly a fun class (if you don't have a teacher that just let's you learn useless stuff)
For me, it was basically a mix between history and ethics class
We just talked about how to be a good human and learned about the history of every religion and the differences between them
I don't get why so many people are against these classes
I would say that I spended a couple of hours on it each trimester back in (Flemish) highschool
Yes
8 fucking years of French for every Flemish student, starting in 5th grade
I studied science-mathematics (one of the least language focused studies) and I still had 3 hours of French per week, while only having 2 hours of English
In 7th grade I studied modern sciences and had 6(!) hours of French
If the school system was good enough so everyone would be fluent in French, I wouldn't mind
But of course that's not the case
It's bullshit
And when you then learn that Dutch isn't even mandatory in Wallonia, it's frustrating and completely understandible why so many Flemish people want to separate
Imo it's the basic form of respect to at least make it mandatory to learn the *majority language* (by far) of the country your living in
And then some Walloons still get mad when we don't (or just refuse to) speak French to them
Imagine if the Frisians didn't learn Dutch, I'm sure they would be hated too by a lot of Dutch people
It is
Zeg dat het minder energie kost om insecten te kweken omdat een populatie insecten heel snel biomassa opbouwt
Vergelijk het dan met hoe lang de draagtijd van landbouwdieren duurt
Zeg dat dit logisch is want grote dieren verspillen veel energie aan homeostase
Kippenvlees is ook duurzamer dan koeienvlees
Begin vervolgens over gekweekte vis: alle populaire vissen zijn carnivoor
Je moet eerst herbivore zeedieren kweken, die dan slachten en vermalen tot vismeel: dat dient dan als voer voor de carnivore vissen
Enorme energie- en waterkost
Veel beter zou zijn om insecten te kweken en die te voeren aan de vissen
Begin ook over alle voedselverspilling en zeg dat insecten dat kunnen opeten
Het Belgische bedrijf Millibeter gebruikt hiervoor de zwarte wapenvlieg en krijgt vervallen voedsel van de supermarkt
Lol, in Belgium we litteraly share a village with The Netherlands
There are random zones in this town which are part of Belgium and random zones part of The Netherlands
There litteraly is a store right now which half of it is closed during lockdown because it is in belgium and the other half of the store is open because it is in NL
Shop divided in 2: [
Since Baarle and Putte are already taken, I'm going with **Monschau
** Not a Belgian city, a German city, but the Belgian border runs through its borders - twice
To get from **Monschau, Germany** to **Mützenich, Germany,** one needs to cross through 40 meters of Belgian territory
That'd be two border controls, if people would be silly
The thin slice of Belgium, as seen clearly on the map below, is an old railway line given to Belgium as part of the Treaty of Versailles
Nowadays, it's part of a cycle network
Yes
The Benelux (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxemburg) has had a tariff union since 1944 and a full on economic union since 1958
The European Union was inspired by the Benelux Union multiple times
Serious explanation: during the late 12th century some Duke gave away lands to some other Lord
Fast forward 800 years later and one lord's lands were part of Belgium while the other pieces of land were part of the Netherlands
It's never been a problem so there's never been a reason to try and untangle the cluster fuck
Another possible answer: Why not
Definitely
Well, Germans seem to see their aggression and attack of Belgium and France in WW1 as some sort of legitimate act of "defense".
Meanwhile, we see it as a barbaric and unjustified action, as the actual starting of WW1
They not only illegaly and unlegitimately invaded a neutral country, they as well : killed thousands of innocent civilians, pillaged Wallonia and destroyed its industries, imposed a reign of terror on Walloons
And if it wasn't enough, they tried to sabotage the country as a whole, by exporting their vision of nationalism to the Flemings, and revisioning/simplifying history by making them believe that Walloons were the ones forcing French upon them (while in reality, it was the bourgeoisie and nobility, Flemish included, that oppressed both Dutch-speaking Flemings and Walloon-speaking Walloons)
This act of sabotage is known as Flamenpolitik
Ironically, Germans were less barbaric and savage in Belgium during WW2
But while they apologise for WW2, they seem to think they did nothing wrong in WW1
The fact that Dutchies don’t believe that without Flanders they would have never become the Naval power they used to be
during the 16th century Flanders was one of the wealthiest regions in Europe, because we were the biggest trade region north of Italy
At the time of the Spanish war The Netherlands were absolutely nowhere near the power/ wealth Flanders had
Because of this war many Flemish merchants fled to cities as Amsterdam
When they fled they also brought their wealth and knowledge
After some time they started doing business as back home and the rest is history
He's remembered as both a warmonger and a reformer by a lot of people
He's viewed negative and positive here
Negative because obviously he conquered us and positive because he brought a lot of reforms like everyone having last names and just the laws
That's like a French person saying they deserved to win the last world cup football
(I hope I don't start a war here lol)
Well basically our whole country supported Croatia
Yup and imo they deserved to win
I was surprised at how much Danish, Swedish and Norwegian I could understand if I focused enough on the text
I also noticed that the longer, more complicated words were often similar to Dutch (högreståndspersoner  - personen van een hogere stand) whereas short, simple words were completely different
Are scandinavic language german
I speak Dutch as a mother tongue and I'm pretty fluent in English so I understand everything of those languages
So:
Afrikaans: basically 100%
Low German: 50-60%
Luxembourgish: 40-50%
German: 30-40%
Bavarian: maybe like 10-20% at most
Danish, Swedish and Norwegian: almost nothing except a word here and there
Icelandic: nothing
For some reason I can understand a lot of German if it's spoken, but if it's written it's very hard to understand words
Yeah
Flemish isn't even a language
It's a collection of Dutch dialects and Germanic languages that are politically called Flemish
As a french belgian, when I read dutch it's flemish (I barely understand spoken dutch)
No, this is more something from the generation of my grand-parents
Well, the [second version of our anthem] was quite hostile toward the Dutch crown/royal family
Considering how the Dutchies seem to like them, since they even decided to take their name as national colour, they would probably find it offensive
> Les lacs du Connemara
What's even funnier, is that this song is a staple at weddings over here, or at least in Flanders
Do you wave your napkins around to this song or is that just us
We have this classic from the early 2000s. I had not heard the [original] yet
Al wie da ni springt
Al wie da ni springt
Al wie da ni springt is homofiel
>Everyone who doesn't jump is homosexual (though countless variations have been around)
Song for children were usually quite odd
This was a song for dividing children up in two groups
Two children take eachother by the hands and form a gate where the rest of the group has to go through while singing:
>White swans
>Black swans
>Who wants to sail with us to England
>England is closed
>The key is broken
>Is there no smith in the country
>Who can fix the key
>Let go through, let go through
>Who stays behind has to lead(?)
At the end, the two put there arms down, capturing whoever was going through it
That child then has to choose between a golden apple or a silver pear
They wisper the answer and that decision decides behind which of the 2 children they have to stand
Children songs are weird is all I'm saying
Student militias
What
What is the oignon's song
Never heard of it
And when played, it's tradition that the guests will wave their napkins around
Can confirm, am flemish and knew this
I didn't want to make it sound more ridiculous than it already is tbh
I tend to gravitate towards England and the Ottomans in most Paradox games
Rarely my own origins
My favourites in EU4 are Burgundy, Muscovy and one of the powers in Northern-China like the Yurchen tribes or Mongolia or a successor
Japan is also nice for playing in Asia
I only played ckII once and I played as Sweden it was fun but I never touch the game since !
But in EUIV I usually love to play as Poland or France, both of them have rival that are kinda challenging to take down and they both have interesting mission tree !
Imperator Rome: Menapia
Crusader Kings 2: The duchy of Flanders
Europa Universalis IV: Flanders
Victoria 2: Belgium
Hearts of Iron 4: Belgium
I play Belgium because it is a minor nation, wich is more challenging and fun IMO, and because i'm Flemish, seeing my country endure gives me a patriotic pride
I also play a lot of Sweden and Romania, but major powers like Engeland or Germany/HRE are a bit overwhelming for me
In eu4 Austria, lowlands or German duchies
In Victoria II Prussia or Belgium
I usually tend to play with the German (Age of Empire) for the cavalry and big industry
Then again I'm from a Pseudo-Germanic side of Belgium
Usually not as fleshed out as the more prominent nations
Sure, me too, but despite these origins we have more in common with our other neighbors
I would be quite scared if they made a Belgian Faction in Age of Empire (colony are not something we should have any more) but a game set in the antiquity could be quite cool (Maybe Total War Troy if they make DLC faction up north)
Yeah, I guess that's part of being Belgian
I do kind of identify with the Netherlands and have enjoyed playing as the Netherlands in EU4, but I do also identify with France (and I enjoy playing France too)
Can't be bothered to play as Vlaanderen though, that too much of a challenge
Burgundy in EU4 is pretty good to play
You'll like it since it's largely about trade, colonialism and development
You just have to fight past the difficult beginning and take care of France
Repaying the loans needed for that is enough incentive to play the trade game
The 'record' is shared by different small villages, all situated in Wallonia
The names are Nil-Saint-Vincent-Saint-Martin, Malèves-Sainte-Marie-Wastines, Geest-Gérompont-Petit-Rosière and Chaussé-Notre-Dame-Louvignies (26 letters)
If your talking about cities then Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve (23 letters) has the longest name
Belgium has Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, 26 characters
I'm planning on maybe visiting Utrecht for a weekend
Heard it was pretty nice there and it's not too far away
Amsterdam
I've somehow never been there
I know Dutch people often say it's overrated but I don't care
I've only ever been to Zeeland in the Netherlands
When I visit Amsterdam, I'll probably also visit the Waddeneilanden and maybe Friesland
Not this year since I bought an appartment a year ago and I'm still rebuilding my financial reserves, but the next trip I plan, is to visit Moscow or St
Petersburg
Because Russian architecture is really beautiful and it has been on my wishlist since I was a kid
Especially Moscow
Always been fascinated by Russia
Also, the very tip of Scandinavia
Because I want to see the polar night
It must be so weird
There was this wonderful reddit thread I checked before I did my Erasmus there, I’ll see if I can find it
(PM me if I havent linked it by tonight haha)
I terms of smaller cities in Belgium I would definitely recommend Leuven
Only about 100 000 inhabitants but it houses a huge university so very vibrant with plenty of things to do
For Belgium, I would recommend : Dinant and Durbuy for picturesque value
For historical value : Tournai : ancient capital of the Franks, under Childeric and Clovis
I've been there twice before
Overrated, sure, but definitely worth the visit
It has a lot of nice stuff but it's just crowded with annoying tourists who are only there for weed and hookers
Isn't Brno the place with the race track
So you're saying I can go to the Netherlands without having to miss a trusty old Belgian café? Now I'm definitely sold
Leuven is a big city though, 100 000 inhabitants is big
Yeah well size is relative and looking at the average city in France (and Europe in general) I'd consider Leuven small, but I get it
How about Ypres then
Or Durbuy for the smallest of small
It is relative indeed
I must admit that I'm biased by my Belgian perspective of what is a big city, and even more so from the Walloon Brabant perspective, where the "biggest" city has "only" 40 000 inhabitants
Yeah we don't have many "big" cities in Belgium
Looking at it in a broader perspective, I think only Brussels and Antwerp would qualify as such
Ghent, Charleroi and Liège are arguable, but everything beneath that I'd say could be considered "small" by modern standards
Knokke for sure
They ride golf carts through center of town as if it was a normal means of transportation
Some of them also pretend to have French accents just to sound fancier and their mayor was for years on end (42 years to be exact) the local Count who was a product of incest and who openly hated on the lower classes (died this year)
That's how old money Europe it gets right there
On top of that it's not even a beautiful city or anything
Vienna immediately comes to mind as a place for rich people
Is Zürich worse
I have never been there
Also so much fur coats over there, it's unsettling
A one way tram ticket is nearly 7CHF if my memory serves, so yeah I think we can say Zurich is one step above (but I agree with you about Vienna looking rich, especially the touristy places)
Yeah I don't think anyone understands the whole golf cart thing they got going on there
But obviously there's also plenty of Porsches and fat BMW's going around to make sure you don't forget their cash cash money
EDIT: [just as a little example of the counterbalance]
Yeah I have no clue why anyone would like to live there haha
It's terribly ugly and terribly expensive
All those ugly apartments in the back literally cost millions
Truly mindboggling
And for Belgians, the UK and France feel like Eastern Europe
I think Russia lol
I have never seen any more foreign one,  although I do not really pay attention to license plates
Saw an Estonian plate in my street in a small town where not many foreigners live
Very surprised  as I rarely seen any non-Belgian plates in my area
When I was in Cannes, France there was a whole street full of super expensive cars with license plates from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE
Yesterday we passed a truck with a Kazakhstan license place on the highway
There's Kazakh, Moldavian and Armenian Cars parked in my street in Brussels center
I see a lot of American plates around Tervuren
I've seen a Texan drive around here in Belgium once
Didn't really need a license plate to tell me that, because his vehicle was HUGE, but it did confirm it
While at the north rim of Grand Canyon, I spotted a small VW bus with Belgian number plates
It turned out to be a couple of travellers from less than 5 km from where I live(d) in Belgium
It felt a bit weird to speak Flemish (again) overlooking the Grand Canyon in the rain
The weather made it feel very "belgian".
Weird license plate
To be exact, it's the tail that is little, not the monkey
Not to be confused with "aapjestaart" which would be little monkeys pie
Most Belgians cheer for anyone who's playing against France
If both Belgium and the Netherlands are playing, we better bloody well win from those Dutchies
But once we're out of the game and the Netherlands are still in, we root for them
You go, you lovely orange cheeseheads
Yes I would support The Netherlands
We love to tease each other but at the end of the day we do share a language that bonds is
I'd never cheer for France or The Netherlands
Maybe for Spain or England though
I'll cheer for netherlands if belgium is knocked out as long as they don't win
When Belgium is out me and my friends generally cheer for any country against France ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'll cheer for Spain as half of my family comes from there
Sometimes I'll cheer for Germany or the Netherlands but never ever for France
Not France
Same
And we cheer for you too
^Unless ^Luxembourg ^is ^playing
Has been the case for as long as I can remember haha
I would never root for them
you forgot a few:
5- happy
6- cake
7- day
Broo
Everybody hate the French
To each their own I guess
We can still hope
Living in the Netherlands I found that people will talk far more directly to you than they would in Belgium
I considered a few remarks I got just to be rude and as if people were invading my privacy
Netherlands and UK: How small their houses are on average
Same here, I knew a Canadian exchange student years ago and I took him to a Belgian techno club once and the next day he literally told me 'I don't understand European nightlife' hahahaha
I can add a +1 on the bureaucracy in France
It was equally bad in Bordeaux
Go to the pub around 9pm
Have some drinks
Have some laughs
Arrive at party around midnight
Hmm, I don't remember unfortunately
If it has town rights, it's a town
It is funny, I always wondered why they've done that and how this countries can function
I've only been to two (Monaco and Luxemburg, if you count Luxemburg in it because apparently a microstate is a 'country' with less than 400k inhabitants and Luxemburg has more so idk)
I'm Belgian
We are probably the smallest non-micro state in Europe
I don't have any opinion about people in microstates, I don't think a lot about microstates and I think they are a relict of ancient times in which there were a lot of city states
Honestly, some of those microstates were kept alive after the First and Second World War because large European nations thought "oh, so cute that you're still alive
Well, you're a cute puppy and you attract tourists, so you can stay alive". Monaco is a shame within Europe, tax heaven for the rich
Belgians should invade it, just to make a point
Luxembourg is our neighbour, we Belgians and Dutch use it for cheap gas on the way to our vacation in France
And no, this is not a joke
On the other hand, it's fantastic when they beat or draw a big country
Never forget Turkey - San Marino 0-0
I think it was a stupid idea
Things are going to escalate now
Not so very epic future maybe
I'm more worried about the fact that Trump ordered someone to drop bombs on a civilian airport
I'm glad I'm not a young and healthy American male
I just hope we're gonna stay out of this as much as possible
We have no business in picking a fight with Iran
Also, just as re-election year comes up, Trump does this ""heroic"" thing and his supporters will eat it right up, like it happened with Bush
Sadly,  US voters will react to this, by giving Trump an even bigger majority
US media will stand behind their president if this escalates
I dont give a shit if the US thinks we're cowards for not joining their potential war
Fuck them in the ear
Germany, again
Probably the Dutch
They still haven't fully progressed that we became independent about 190 years ago
Luxembourg
You don’t have debt if you kill the bankers
#Thinkaboutit
Since when is Scotland an independent country
A nation must be independent to be called a country, this is neither the case of Scotland or England
Neither do we, so yeah
You want ligma sauce with it
Are you implying that Germany will invade Russia ?
Wait what does it look like
Yeah clearly the US is very willing to impeach their presidents for commiting war crimes, just look at what happened to Bush and Obama for having torture camps
[here] [here] and [here] are some sources that take about 3 seconds to look up
I'm sure you can find about a billion more if you want to look for them
Guantanamo bay doesn't ring a bell
The articles I linked all talk about how torture is still being used there despite being illegal under both international and US law
Even if it isn't being used anymore that doesn't excuse the use of it in the recent past
The point still stands that the US isn't held accountable for commiting war crimes
Not by it's own people or institutions, and because of the threat of war, not by international organisations
They were under Bush and under Obama, and several sources claim that they still use torture there, even if they claim not to
We can leave those speculations for what they are as long as there is no evidence to prove them, but given the US's stance odds of an unbiased investigation is pretty low
Either way, the point still stands that under the Bush administration Guantanamo bay was turned into a torture camp, which is a war crime, and under the very same administration the policy was ratified to invade any country hosting an international court that would put on trial an American for war crimes
Most people in what
Guantanamo bay
Most people in it are put in it with no trial or investigation
Even if we live in the assumption that every person in imprissoned in Guantanamo bay is 100% certain a war criminal, that doesn't give the US free reign to torture them
Commiting war crimes against war criminals still is a war crime
This isn't hard
Oh great, whataboutism, such a great argument
Are you claiming that other countries do nothing to combat terrorism and that the USA is somehow this sole beacon of justice in a war against evil
Cause if that's your argument I'm gonna suggest you check yourself into a mental clinic of some sort, cause you're fucking crazy
Obviously terrorism is bad, nobody is saying that it isn't, but if you can't see that torturing people and then threatening to invade your own allies if they hold any of your people accountable for their crimes is a bad thing, then you really are blind
like locking away people without a trial or investigation, torturing them, threatening war on your own allies if they hold you accountable for your war crimes and claiming the moral high ground while doing all that
Great things you're doing there
You must feel very proud
We have "social restaurants" where you can get a meal for cheap
Cheapest I know of is €5 for soup, main course, dessert and coffee
What great/catchy songs will never be famous worldwide since it's written in your native language
This one's from Belgium, the Flemish part to be precise
It's a very famous song here, a classic if you will
People from the uk : sad English noises
Everything from Fleddy Melculy
[L'Enfer des Dieux] by Mass Hysteria is quite catchy
Mia by gorki is beautiful, and I think it's pretty well Known in the flemish part of Belgium
First two are known here too c:
That song is indeed beautiful
I love old music like that
Geweldig liedje bij het feesten hahah
Schlager
Yees this one
Honestly this reminds me of Lorenzo's "Fume à Fond". It's a French rap song about smoking weed
Quite catchy as well imo
What about the wonderful [Moonspell] ?
Bijelo Dugme is awesome
Very qualitative rock
Thought you were gonna post something like "de kreuners -ik wil je"
I've never heard the one you posted before
I'm not that into Flemish music but I have to say this one is better than a lot of the things I hear in flanders
"Ik moet zuipen" stays on the top of my "best ducht songs"-list tho
Die had ik nog niet gehoord maar klinkt goed
And nobody heard it in Francophone Belgium, where music in Dutch isn't played on radio
Flemish songs, is sang in Dutch, aren't even famous in all the country
I did not know of this song
I would've thought something made by Clouseau, K3 of Niels Destadsbader (skwon meiske is catchy imo )
Or happy Welsh or Scottish-Gaelic noises
"Het is een nacht" is de grootste schijf ooit
What about "Ik Moet Zuipen" van Schorre Chef
Kaizers Orchestra is amazing
Personally i like Glittertind's songs too
Norwegian is a gorgeous language
Everyone singing in English would be kind of boring though
Italy "fixed" this in 2018 by having the lyrics on-screen in tons of languages
Since they got 5th then, it seemed appreciated
Hahaha can't argue with that, that's a true must on the party playlist
Oh sorry, maybe this link will work
If not, the song is called "Als ze lacht" by Yevgueni
België!
Is er leven op Pluto
As you can see I'm not good at electronics, the first link should work though
Kun je dansen op de maan
In the Flemish version he had a West-Flemish Accent
I found it pretty fitting
Ge zit nen tovenoare, Harry
Echt
In de filmversie
Nog eens dringend herbekijken dan hahah
De mop is dat ik weet waar die link naartoe gaat zonder er zelfs op te klikken
Edit: ik had gelijk
More accurately, "brief" is a letter/postal and "briefje" just means it's a small one
And "spieken" bassically means cheating/copying (on a test)
In Belgium (french-speaking part) we say "un copion", from the verb "copier", to copy
The whole point of a cheat note is that you are not allowed to use it
;-)
No, though in some schools there are a few lockers available for a small rent
Yes but only a few use them and there are only 40 lockers in total
Well, we need to bring our books in school bags every day to school
However, my school has small lochers but you need to be quick because there are only like 150 for 450 students
Luckily if you rent one (pretty cheap), you can keep it untill you leave the school so you don't need to try to get one every year
Most students just put their bag with clothes for physical education class and their stuff for drawing class in it
And maybe a couple books but there isn't enough space for all of them
Yes ! They were quite tiny and you could rent them for a school year
I know my school had lockers but I know it's not the norm
During the first 4 years of high school, we had homerooms were the majority of our classes were thaught in (except classes that required specialized equipment, like sciences), so we just stashed most of our books in our desks
In my last two years we didn't have those anymore so every class was in a different room
They had lockers but not enough for all students and they came at a small fee
I never bothered with them but most of my peers seemed to like it
we all had our own locker in my school and the schools I know of
This doesn’t seem to be the case everywhere  though now that I read some of the comments
I went to 2 different high schools
They both had them but they were optional
It was more to leave your lunch and some personal stuff
Everyone carries their books in their backpacks
We also had to pay a fee but it was 5€ and you could get them back at the end of the year when you gave back your card
I don't think it's very common elsewhere to not be in their shoes all day tbh
The same in Dutch
10^3 = duizend
10^6 = miljoen
10^9 = miljard
10^12 = biljoen
10^15 = biljard
10^18 = triljoen
10^21 = triljard
Etc
I thin in french it’s the same with billion/trillion
This page disagrees
How would you say quadrillion
Tahutbiljoona (thousand biljoona)
That word doesn't seem to exist
I think our way of doing it is sensible
There is clear logical there
Most of the European mainland uses this system and I agree
We work in powers of a million
10^6 is a miljoen
(10^6 )^2 is a biljoen
(10^6 )^3 is a triljoen
Etc
The thousands inbetween have the same prefix but end with 'ard' instead
1000 * 10^6 = miljard = duizend miljoen
1000 * (10^6 )^2 = biljard = duizend miljoen
1000 * (10^6 )^3 = triljard = duizend triljoen
Etc
On the otherhand, english has stepped into a system of thousands which gives you:
10^3 = thousand
(10^3 )^2 = (10^3 )^(1+1) = million
(10^3 )^3= (10^3 )^(2+1) = billion
(10^3 )^4 = (10^3 )^(3+1) = trillion
(10^3 )^n is named after n-1 for n>1
This makes way less sense, on top of that thousend doesn't follow the same ruleset even though it is clearly a power of 1000
It would make more sense if they said
(10^3 ) = million
(10^3 )^2 = billion
(10^3 )^3 = trilion
They don't make as much sense as the long system, where numbers are more predictable
The numbers have prefixes indicating how many groups of six zeros there are
- Million = 1 000 000 ^1
- Billion = 1 000 000 ^2
- Trillion = 1 000 000 ^3
- Quadrillion = 1 000 000 ^4
So if you want to know the magnitude of a septillion, it's easier and more intuitive to figure it our in the long system than the short system
- Septillion= 1 000 000 ^7 = 10 ^(6 *7) = 10^42 = 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
The short system doesn't have these neat identities
That's not what I meant
How do you say 10^15 in Finnish
It's billiard in French, biljard in Dutch, quadrillion in English
Do you say tahutbiljooni in Finnish
Wow, didnt know that
Cool fact
That's not as straight forward at all
No wonder it isn't! This formula was retrofitted onto the short system, rather than defining it
That's also how you used to say it in British English
It's easy but vastly more complex
You can draw a continuous graph through any sequence of numbers
The long scale draws a simple graph, as it was designed to do so
The short scale doesn't.
Yes, we have old coal mines that sometimes sink buildings
I think it's about 60% Dutch, 40% French
I think the whole dividing in communes, regions and provinces by itself makes us stand out
You started the first one too by attacking Belgium and France
If you hadn't done it, it wouldn't have gone world war
Tbh Eastern Europe is catching up pretty fast and that time spent with communist regimes is probably the major cause for why Eastern Europe had such an economy
Are you sure that's not the UK
Has it been in continuous use in that time
(including for regional during occupation ofc)
That would break my heart
Yeah I know I was just saying the numbers, I wasn't saying you're wrong
Belgium was a neutral country, it couldn't let Germans go through
Germany had no valid/legitimate reason to attack
Germany could have decided not to enter the war
They had no valid/legitimate reason to attack
I know but you're talking about electronic music culture which is a lot bigger than edm
No, it’s not
If I exit through the back I look at the driver through his mirror and do the little nod thing to thank him
At one point I took a bus, Monday to Friday, for 2 years
I've never even so much as looked at him
Like, I wouldn't want random strangers talking to me in his situation
Over here in West Flanders it is, at least in smaller cities
Really
I’m from there too and honestly never heard anyone do that before
If it's a long one and you're in the back, it can't be helped
Funny because I hear it all the time
Well, let's do the math here :
* Europe + USA = 1,07 billion people
USA being only 327 million
* China alone = 1,4 billion people
Blizzard is a capitalist company, the choice is made for the shareholders and company owner/CEO : China = more potential profit
Don't expect ethics and morality from capitalism, there is none in it
People can die, suffer, starve, as long as corporations make profit
That the whole point of capitalist economy/ideology, just look at the millions starving every year, despite the fact there is actually much more food that we need to feed everybody
I just tried to send a request and they want to verify it's my account so they're asking for my ID
Now that's a dilemma
Faire enough, but living standards in China are rising, its middle class is growing
So, while just now it still doesn't have the same purchasing power, it might have in 10 or 20 years
In long terms, China is a big potential market
Besides, China quite likely produces most Blizzards goodies and electronics, so, I don't think they can afford to loose them
You're going to love the Baarle-Hertog/Baarle-Nassau border my friend
Cyprus and Czechia
We may not have the prettiest border, but I like the coincidence that we have a monarchy, and that [we have a little crown on top
Though ironically our King, compared to most other monarchies, is a popular monarch, meaning he is not a king of the land, but rather a king of the people
They should come together and form the Phallic union
A boot kicking a piece or rock
Imperialism at it's very worst
Any country that takes being in favour of democracy serious should severely condemn the invasion
Of course not a single EU nation will dare to do so
Make of that what you will
As we had ISIS-attacks in Belgium and the Kurds fought with the Alliance against the terrorists, our country should absolutely support them
Plus I see no reason, why Turkey should be helped
TBF, they weren't getting in the EU anytime soon ever since Erdogan got dictatorship fantasies
Okay, I respect your opinion but here's a fact
Kurdistan doesn't exist
We fought for these lands and still are fighting the PKK (a kurdish terror organization) and will not give up the lands just because they wanted independence
That's like Spain giving away Catalonia or Serbia giving Kosovo
I personally don't support Erdogan and the younger generation who will be voting in the next elections (which i am a part of) dont really like Erdogan and so naturally we wont be voting for him but still Kurds won't be getting independence with the new president unless the new president is a pro kurdish independence guy
(I do recognize the Armenian Genocide fyi)
It's the first real anarchist country, even with all the flaws
They were building a very good and healthy country, and trying to make all ethnicities feel welcome and heard
"Your land".
I do not condone terrorist actions by the PKK or any other groups, but you have to admit, considering what 'your blood' did for centuries, it rather pales in comparison
Armenians, Greeks and now Kurds who have been around in those areas for centuries as well
Just admit it, it's not that hard
What you said IS correct, we did not treat them with the respect they had deserved but what im trynna tell is that they wont be getting indepencence
If someone would deserve independence for being treated like shit then why are there no black republics in North America or Europe
Yes, there are a few things which give it away
Non-native accents are really hard to get rid of, up to the point where it’s sometimes even possible to hear what a speaker’s native language when they’re speaking English
Native speakers also tend to have a certain style and use less common words and expressions which tends to give it away
You can usually pick out the Dutch and French accents very easily
Yeah, for example, Dutch speakers seem to use the word 'also' a lot more compared to 'too' or 'as well', which is probably because 'also' is in the same position in the sentence as 'ook' in Dutch
Yes they all mean 'ook', but 'also' is in the same position in the sentence as 'ook' is in Dutch, while the other 2 aren't.
For dying, and indirectly related to biting, we have "casser sa pipe", to break one's pipe
But it's the reverse connection: if you're biting the pipe it means you're alive
When you die, you let go, the pipe falls to the ground and breaks
Here in Belgium we use it the same way
De houten mantel aantrekken is another one
Our politics
Nobody understands it any more, not even Belgians
In Belgium we fry our fries twice
This is apparently something other countries don't do
If you think you understand Belgian politics, whoever explained it to you explained it wrong
Why are there condoms in the baby box

It ridiculous
AnneMayKantereit is a phenomenal German band I don't even care that I don't understand jack shit of the lyrics
i would say it's [1 uit de 1000] if i were to guess which is most popular right now
Belgium: Brussels
Flanders: well, basically everyone picks on West-Flanders or Limburg, except if they are from that region, plus obviously French speakers
Walloons: no clue, I assume they just pick on Flanders or something
In Belgium probably the french-speaking part
For people from Flanders Walloonia is the odd one out, for Walloon people, Flanders us the odd one out
I would say our German speaking minority that live near the border
I guess it would be the Oostkantons
Everybody seems to forget they even exist
For Belgium it's the Germanspeaking Community
that's like half the country
East Cantons
No, definitely Flanders, the only part of Europe where voting for ancient collaborators and former Nazis is seen as normal and doesn't shock people
Yes there's that too, ofcourse
And still not having a government because of it
> Doesn't shock people
What newspapers have you been reading copain
You know I'm including the N-VA right
Apparently Flemish people consider the N-VA a normal party, despite its dubious origin, despite the fact Jan Jambon went to event in favor of ancient Flemish SS, despite the far-right links and idead of Theo Francken, despite the ancient nazi, and neo-nazi Bob Maes was made a member of the Antwerpen branch of the N-VA
I hate Maluma

Now you made me cry because I remembered that Kamping Kitsh is also canceled
So basically the liefde voor muziek songs
Is it really worse than Maître Gims or Jul though
Euh
It works
2 girls now having their own households, but only one had boyfriends stay overnight (as far as we know) when she still lived with us
A typical conversation then
"Oh mum, it's possible so-and-so will stay the night".
"OK, just protect yourself, clean up afterwards and don't make too much noise
Is he staying for breakfast ?"
Her bedroom was next to ours, and there have been occasions we could hear him snore
If you're bringing a crush over to spend the night, everyone kinda assumes you're having sexual intercourse anyway
It's not exactly discussed, unless you're ruining other people's sleep
I think it also helps that our houses are not made of plywood, but more often solid brick
So the sound isolation is generally pretty decent
Let's see
I could sleep at my gf's house or she could sleep with me since around 16
(never heard a no for these things but I didn't exactly ask it at 14)
My first girlfriend lost her virginity(and I mine) in her bed at home with her parents downstairs
Never had an issue with this in general
One of those problems I'm too European to understand I think
I can't imagine that my parents would frown upon bringing a girlfriend home for the night
They might not be happy at having a series of girls at breakfast, but I suppose as long as you are reasonably discrete, they wouldn't mind
For an internship I once lived some weeks with my (still quite catholic) grandparents
I know they made a fuss when my parents wanted to move in together before they were married
So I was quite nervous to ask whether my long term girlfriend could stay the night, and I was prepared for the demand that she would stay in another room
They were perfectly fine with it
Yep
Currently age 29 and my sister is 26
I hear my sister and her boyfriend
She will sometimes hear my gf
Leave the room for a while or set up a headset or something
I'll catch them fucking in the pool
They caught me and my gf on occasion
Sex happens, get over it
Brought girls home since I was 16, even got my own hotel room when she went with us on holiday
We had a lot of fun being able to be a tad louder that week
Damn, that was to the US
We broke a lot of laws over there, haha
No way we're not having champagne on New Years Eve
Never had to lock the door because frankly, if you suddenly enter my room and my gf is riding my dick it's your own damn fault
As I learned the hard way, lol
Caught my sister doing exactly that at one point when I went over to ask if she needed anything at the shop next door
Ow, and the noise thing, do note that my room was build out of concrete and brick basically, including the inner walls
If I want to hang something on the wall you better have a drill
A hammer won't do and noise is in general less of an issue
We're both more or less planning to move out next year
We worked for the family company so it was just easier to live at home and save money for when we do move out
I'm leaving home next year with around €210k.
"Could do safe experimenting in my own bed ;)"
This is what baffles me honestly
Why wouldn't you want your daughter to lose her virginity where she's most comfortable
Had sex for the first time at my gf's place at 16 while her parents were downstairs
Looking at it from the comfort and safety of the girl's point of view that just seems rather ideal
Would be nice if there were some people over here who know it out of their head
Since it contains the lyric "Oh flourish country, with a unity that can't be broken" and considering our current political climate, where there's a very obvious ideological split between the two regions, making the formation of a federal government impossible, I always found that line a bit ironic
No one knows it by heart back here
We have ‘De brabaçonne’ in Belgium but because we speak not only one language it really weird before a soccer match
In general I think the unofficial anthems are way better
Rule Britannia for example
My mother is Italian and my father a fan of Ferrari, we would always hum that song when Ferrari won a F1 circuit
Happy memories
O dierbaar België o heilig land der vaaderen
Onze ziel en ons hart zijn u gewijd
Aanvaard de kracht en het bloed van onze aderen
Wees ons doel in arbeid en in strijd
O land in eendracht niet te breken
Wees immer u zelf en ongeknecht,
Het woord getrouw dag ge onbevreesd moogt spreken
voor vorst, voor vrijheid en voor recht
Voor vorst, voor vrijheid en voor recht
Voor vorst, voor vrijheid en voor recht
Pa pa pa paa pa pa pa pa pa pa paaa papapa
Pa pa pa pa pa papapapa VOOR VORST, VOOR VRIJHEID EN VOOR RECHT
I never had to learn the text, probably never will, since I don't care
Don't like the anthem either tbh
Ô Belgique, ô mère chérie,
À toi nos cœurs, à toi nos bras
À toi notre sang, ô patrie,
Nous le jurons tous, tu vivras !
Tu vivras, toujours grande et belleee,
Et ton invincible unité,
Aura pour devise immortelleee,
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté
Aura pour devise immortelleee,
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté
Imo La Brabançonne is a beautiful anthem
I had to learn it at school 2 years ago and I still know and I love it
It's definitely on the beautiful side
Also, anthems are just as good as the community of the country standing behind it
Look at the Welsh anthem when performed in stadiums, goosebumps
Very good
Just in time haha
And thank you
According to one of our prime ministers it goes:
"Allons enfants de la Patrie
They just fought Netherlands and needed a king dude with a good network to guarantee neutrality
They had to make him want to stay I guess
Mostly Granny Smiths and Pink Ladies
I'd say around 5
1 or 2 green varieties, 1-2 cheap red varieties, pink lady & bio
Egg shells ... crack ... causer
Belgium as well
Did you know they also work amazing for slicing mushrooms
Protip: they're also really good at slicing mushrooms
Which kind
We generally use the metal one like [this
But I've heard tale of string based slicers being used in Scandinavian countries
My parents have had the same one since 1998
My in-laws get a new one every year though, always from Bond Zonder Naam
Went on exchange last semester and some people were absolutely baffled when I said I (and most other Belgians) owned a deepfryer at home lol
That's so weird,  i never thought about it that they might not have it
My family was one of the households without a fryer, and i also don't have one
(Too dangerous
That is what frituren are for,  no
Dutch has alot of them
Half our language consists of words that could be childspeak
Fridge
Koelkast (cold closet)
Glove
Handschoen (hand shoe)
Hippopotamus
Nijlpaard (Nile horse)
Turtle
Schildpad (shield frog)
(Edit) another iconic one is the word Sloth - Luiaard (Lazy being) and Hospital - Ziekenhuis (house of sick people)
Well, we call gloves "handschoenen", which translates to "hand shoes"
Same in Dutch although not used that often:  'schietgeweer' is 'shootgun'
Wait, you don't say GSM for smartphones and mobile phones
Well German also has some childish sounding words like 'Fahrrad' (idk if that's the wright spelling) which is a bycicle
Literally it means drive  wheel (I think)
> Luipaard (lazy horse)
It comes from leopard though, the fact that evolved to sound like "lazy horse" is pure coincidence
Ladybug
Pimpampoentje
Afrikaans is on another level
Kijkkassie (Watching box) aka Television
Even tho I heard that word isn’t being used anymore
Flemish here, we call it a ‘brommer’.
Well, German and Dutch are closely related
We also call a turtle a shield-toad (schildpad), but a bike is just a fiets
Well like I said it's not used often and I don't think it would get used by military people, but more just in 'de volksmond'
I prefer it over "mobieltje". This is a hill I'm willing to die on
Maybe that's only in the Netherlands but I've never heard of that word
Well
Yes
You're not alone
And whomst'd've
talk dirty to me, daddy
It looks a lot like a traditional student cantus (drinking and singing evening)
No clapping, knock on the table instead
Make a V sign with your hands if you wish to speak, a T sign to ask for a time out to go to the bathroom
If the "speaker" says surgite, all must rise, sedimus =sit down
The rules and customs are archaic, sometimes dumb and pointless, but usually necessary so a bunch of drunk students are able to sing the same song at the same time without too much loss of time
It's not unsurprising that the House of Commons looks like a student party :)
I love it
At least it’s fun to look at
Animo
Neither in French, we only have, if I have to only cite the non-vulgar/crude ones and non-slang ones :
* Faire l'amour : make love
* Avoir une relation sexuelle : have a sexual relationship
* Coucher avec : sleep with
Saying either "avoir du sexe" or "faire du sexe" is incorrect in French; we would understand, but it would sound really weird, and we would spot you are not a native speaker
Late af, but we perpetrate it
There's also ["faire ngolo ngolo dans la case"] by far the most common
That's slang language (never heard anyone say that), I don't talk about slang in my comment
As a reminder to who that gave the ultimate sacrifice in WW1
Came here to say the same thing
First thing that came to my mind as well
Pistolekes met maanzaadjes
The only downside is that you'll find seeds stuck to your teeth until a few hours after you ate it
And that they apparently count as a form of doping within the cycling community
Don't think so here in Flanders
It's just detective, romance, crime, etc
Witte gids(white guide), gele gids(yellow guide) are a few others in that sense
Business and private(fixed lines) phone numbers
Same for Brussels
I doubt Sweden could've remained a great power in Europe into the 18th century, Russia would always have westernised at some point and the coalition of the Great Northern War was simply too much to handle
And if Sweden hadn't lost Finland to Russia in the Napoleonic wars Finland would've still become independent in the 20th century
Yeah, I would love it if North America had more than three countries
or exaple: Florida, Texas, Quebec, Louisiana and maybe even some independent west-coast and native American lands
Just the USA is cool too but things could've been so much more interesting over there
I always wonder how life would be ik a united Benelux
Would it be as divided as Belgium is today
How would politcs be
Would the French speaking part be forced to speak Dutch
IC trains between the North and the South
Nice to think about
You lost me at "under the king of orange Nassau", but a Benelux state would be awesome
Belgian revolution wouldn't have happened if you hadn't oppressed and persecuted us
Flemish Nationalism started because they were oppressed
If you treat the Flemish as equal I am sure the cultural differences would be okay
That's not how 19th century nationalism works, it doesn't care about old political borders
As long as there's a Finnish culture and a Finnish language there's going to be the a push for an independent Finland
Especially with how e.g. Finnish wasn't even a recognised language, or how some notable kings of Swedish in the late 18th and early 19th century had absolutist and/or ultraconservative tendencies (and that's an understatement)
6 million Walloons and 1
2 million Brusseleirs where the majority is French speaking
Just a fun note: we did make a Dutch army retreat from attacking a city because we painted a wooden barrel to look like a cannon
I also walk where I want in Belgium
The knights of King Arthur were a bit like that,  I believe
We do both, roman numerals for more formal texts, normal numbers for informal writing
I'm not sure, but I think so as many shops (even butchers) were given fines for selling surgerymasks at "woekerprijzen" when we were low on masks
Right now those are reasonably cheap, while the more fashionable ones can be a bit more pricy but can be used more (wash them)
We don't think about it much at all, and I'm not quite sure why anybody else would either really
The Yalta conference didn't make a single declaration about what would "go to the Soviets" or whatever, it did the opposite and declared that there would be free elections in *all* liberated territories, including those liberated by the Soviets
Whatever you blame on Yalta and Potsdam probably was never even mentioned at those conferences, and is more a fabrication than anything else
I'm gonna explain some of the stuff that actually happened around the end of the war tho
The Baltic states had already been annexed by the USSR back in 1940, the allies never recognised the Soviet annexation so to say they sold you out is disingenuous
Despite that the Soviet control over the Baltics was unfortunately a political fact that could not be reversed
Poland was the only country that was specifically addressed at Yalta
And what they did was reorganise Stalin's provisional government to be more democratic
Stalin had already made it clear even before Yalta that he would have Poland in his sphere no matter what, and with over 6 million men of the Red Army in between them and Poland the British and Americans practically did the most they could to limit Stalin's influence there
The Polish government-in-exile did a lot to sabotage themselves as well, for example they distanced themselves from the rest of the western allies by taking a hard stance against Poland's new border even though everyone else was in agreement, leaving the Soviets with more influence over what would happen in Poland
Some Czechs like to mention how US troops entered Western Bohemia quite early but forget to mention these were relatively small groups only securing the flanks of the 3rd US Army
There were still a million German troops holed up in Czechia
And even then Czechoslovakia was an actual democratic republic in the post-war years
In 1946 the communists got the plurality of the vote in an actual fair election
Fact of the matter was that after the Nazi invasion and soviet liberation communism had become quite popular, even before they finally did a coup in 1948
I don't really know much about the early postwar history of Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria
I do know though that all 3 were axis allies, and thus part of the enemy, you don't really have the right to complain about "being betrayed".
Most people here are probably too dumb to even know about it
The allies couldn't have liberated Czechoslovakia
It's true that US troops entered Western Bohemia quite early but this disregards that fact that that was a relatively small force that was only securing the flanks of the 3rd US Army
There were still a million German troops holed up in Czechia, and a rear guard isn't going to be enough to beat that
The Soviets used 2 million soldiers to defeat the Germans there, which was as many men as the *entire* British army combined at that time
every single one of the conferences had a famous picture with the big 3 though
lol the old territories
You'd have taken the swamps of Belarus, with basically no ethnic Poles anyway, over places like Gdansk, Silesia, and Prussia
I would thinks the Soviets would be on the left side, you know, with them being communist and all
The Red Army was at no point involved in the coup, there weren't even any Red Army troops in Czechoslovakia at the time
The USSR was involved, but not at all in the way you pretend they were
"KGB units were present during 1946-48"^(\[citation needed\])
Also the KGB wasn't part of the Red Army, and I wouldn't be surprised if what you're talking about was actually the Czech StB
I literally said "citation needed" lmao
Those first 3 articles have nothing to do with the coup, which was what we were talking about
That wikipedia article never even claims that "Moscow" was the one behind the assassination attempt, or that the Russians backed it
In fact it literally says it was the work of the Czech communist party lol
>Don't try to be moving goal-posts now
"They initiated a coup backed by the red army to systematically dismantle democracy in the country
" Oh but sure, I'm the one moving goalposts lol
How about you don't ignore the primary subject
Obviously the Russian secret services were in Czechoslovakia
No shit man, they were also in France, the UK, the USA, etc
Everyone had spies everywhere, they still do, so tell us something we didn't know already
&#x200B;
>Who the hell do you think gave them the support and tools to enact these intrigues
Oh yes, because famously all of the "tools" to stage a coup were stacked away in a barn in Moscow, and nobody could get to them without the explicit consent of Stalin
It's not like the Czech communist party had a secret service of its own
It's not like they were in control of both the police and the army
They didn't control the propaganda ministry, the ministry of the interior, etc
Oh no, wait, they already controlled all of those things before they instigated the coup
A couple dozen NKVD agent that, according to your own article, couldn't even speak Czech, aren't going to instigate a coup lol
Not to mention that the very same paragraph you quoted that from just said they were preparing for what would come *after* the takeover
I've been reading through that article and so far literally the **only** thing I've seen about the KNVD is just that people were making sure that the NKVD was aware of what was going on, not that the NKVD was helping to instigate the coup
let be that they were the main driving force or the ones who enabled it
But I suppose it's much easier to blame outsiders for something that was actually done by Czechs
Y'all took a single sentence in one reply, took out out of context of the original discussion and then changed this thread from "the Red Army backed the coup" to the "the kgb backed the coup" and now to just "there were spies in Czechoslovakia". And then you accuse me from moving goalposts and arguing semantic while I'm *literally* telling you people to stay on the original subject
Not that I expected anything else to come from this anyway lol
Also the first thing I said was that the Red Army didn't back the coup, maybe you should scroll back up again
I'm still waiting for any of you people to post a link to an article, preferably academic, that actually shows the red army or kgb played any significant role in that coup
Bro you literally just quoted "***helping to*** instigate the coup" as "instigate the coup" and responded to it with "I didn't say instigate, I said help". You have done nothing but twisting words, taking stuff out of context, and moving goalposts the entire time and then accused me of doing those things while I'm literally telling you to stay on the subject lol
OP said the red army backed the coup, you literally just admitted that the only thing the Red Army *actually* ***did*** was *existing*.
&#x200B;
>explicitly sent to secure the coup
Have yet to see a source that explicitly says those agents were explicitly send to "secure the coup"
&#x200B;
>We're all fully aware the KSČ caused the coup
Noone is arguing otherwise
There is someone, namely *you*. In the next paragraph you say the coup was carried out on the "orders of Moscow". If Stalin ordered the coup then Stalin would have caused, thus instigated, it
That's how these things work
If a leader gives an order he's the one responsible, even if other people carry it out for him
You're acting like Stalin was that leader, you even try to prove it with some whataboutism with other countries (and the accuracy of those claims are something that I could also start arguing about lol)
You're contradicting yourself
I'm gonna keep it real simple, show me a single academic article that explicitly states that the coup was carried out on the orders of Stalin or the KGB, since that seems to be one of the things you're so adamant about
Not gonna bother replying anymore otherwise ~~(not like I'd bother anymore either way)~~. Nothing that has been linked so far has even as much as alleged that Moscow gave the order though, so good luck lol
I'll take one, no, two doses of Swiss salaries please
A decent functioning government from any Scandinavian country
I'd like to copy a working government from somewhere
\+A BIG national park like they have in the USA (maybe we could turn Wallonia into a park ;) )
Dutch roads and houses that don't look like shit
Cheap groceries from whatever is not Western Europe and sunshine from Southern France pls hmmm also a little bit of untouched nature from any place on earth really (Belgium is too crowded)
Isn't it already the case
Didn't the Icelanders burn down a museum in Reykjavik twice as protest
At this point we would take anything
Even Greek politics is looking like a walk in the park compared to Belgians
You have an infinite amount of styles in one street in Belgium its horrible
>Ps British food is unironically not that bad
In comparison to wot
>Wouldn’t say any system from anywhere else in Europe is better lol
Nah, Finnish education system is Top 2 in the world
It's miles better than not just European countries but just many in the world
Oh, I'm dissapointed
It was to give more autonomy to the different language regions
At the time there was a big movement to stop the frenchification of Flanders
It only came 2 years after the Leuven Vlaams movement in 1968 where there were big riots and slogans like: "Walen buiten
" "Walloons go Home
" and sometimes even "Walen Raus
" were used
The protests made the government fall and removed the French part of the KUL to another city called Louvain-la-Neuve literraly meaning 'New Leuven'.
>After all, we did invent chips
Fighting words
You're lucky I'm not actually from Belgium or else I'd go hard
>Dutch food or German food
Dutch I will agree with
German
you all just make potatoes and meat in different ways with the same few sauces
I'm originally Jamaican so neither of these cuisines are particularly amaze to me
I do love a Yorkshire pudding tho
I don't think so but nowadays there is some talk to confederate the country but even that isn't super likely to happen I think
Plus if you don't know the two biggest parties in Belgium right now are N-VA and Vlaams Belang, who are both Flemish separatist parties
No, but we should
Belgian Gin I would say
Comes in may different flavours
It's delicious
We call it Jenever
Beer is so popular that our beer culture is recognized as [UNESCO intangible cultural heritage] It's hard to name just one beer, given that there are so many though
I really like the amaretto as well
Yeah, jenever is the first thing that comes to mind for me
Jenever is so good, especially in winter
Hmm vanilla, Hasseltse and cactus
Jenever is called also peket in Wallonia
And there is also Zizi Coin coin, a delicious mix citron-cointreau
I think it's easy to get decent at, especially with all the English programs on tv
But hard to master
Most of my friends could make themselves understandable if need be, but it wouldn't sound perfect by a long stretch
Same for me, it's okay over here since I get to think a bit and edit my words, talking fluently AND correctly is a different matter
I think it's deceptive like that
The language itself I would say is easy to begin with but hard to master(few rules), especially as somebody already learning a Germanic language(I want that frisbee/Ik will die frisbee, the structure is incredibly similar at the beginning)
When it comes to me, I'm dutch so
I was playing with an American in the pool in the South of France when I was 8
There are few times I remember not understanding English
Maybe around that time when I was playing but it could be that I was in general not able to read yet
(so age 5 or so
I just remember knowing what to click but not what the buttons themselves said
By age 12 I was reading English books as well as dutch ones and by age 16 foreigners didn't know if I was a native English speaker or not
(I'm saying foreign because I'm still confident an actual British native could tell from my mix of American and British that I wasn't a native speaker)
By age 18 my thought processes were in English and in many fields I have an easier time expressing myself in English
I don't get why english is hard, public schools should have a good english program because that language is mandatory for becoming an expert in any scientifical or international field
English is easy to learn if you love series or comics
Speaking it is hard though, and pronunciation is harder
Schools should teach the [international phonetic alphabet] (IPA), it's actually easy to learn, and it makes learning any language a lot easier
I don't think it is hard it is easy for most people speaking a west European language
But it can be irritating trying to spell words correctly it is almost impossible to know how to spell something correctly if you are using a word for the first time
Some languages have more reasonable spelling for words but some are also worse
My native language being Dutch and having had a LOT of French in school, while having a little English, I'm way more proficient in English than in French
That's probably due to experiencing a lot more English in daily life and it being in the same language family as my native language, but even when compared to German I find English to be one of the easiest languages
I've studied 5 foreign languages and English was by far the easiest one
Dutch is also my native language and English is by far the easiest to learn, and the one I'm the best at, even though I started having French on school 3 years earlier than English and we've always had like dubble the amount of hours a week of French than English
>I don't think English should remain the default language in the EU institutions
Than what would you want as the default language
German or French would make the most sense, but I don't think many politicians would want to learn either one of them
English is a language that most people speak at least a little
Can confirm that Bulgarian is difficult as hell to learn
My learning experiences are pretty much just reading interviews with Bulgarian artists that I like, there's not much else to use
>Pronunciation is Scandanavian languages is very difficult for me
Very true
Consider yourself fortunate you didn't pick Danish, for your tongue would surely be in a triple knot by now
Because only +24M people speak dutch
We are surrounded by countries that speak other languages and have a higher number of speakers
We do not expect people to learn our language
This is why most dutch speaking people are bilingual or trilingual
I speak Dutch (Standard Dutch and West Flemish) and English
I can understand some french, but speaking back is a bit hard
We learned that Dutch is somewhere between English and German in terms of evolution
A lot of the rules that German has now, were also rules that Dutch had in the middle ages
And English has a lot of similatities with what people predict Dutch will look like in the future
I’m learning it out of interest for slavic languages and Bulgaria :) It’s very hard, but that gives me even more satisfaction every time I make progress
It's that sneaky Latin that caused all of this mess
People would speak correct English :
* University would be used instead of college
* Toilet or WC instead of bathroom
* S instead of z (colonise, realise, apologise etc
instead of the ugly/childish-looking colonize, realize, apologize etc
* -Our instead of -or (colour, favourite, humour, etc
instead of color, favorite, humor)
And probably some other details I don't have in mind right now
The ambivalence
Trying to be a reliable platform for a general public but at the same time trying to be a platform for all kind of sexual or porn niches and extremist ideas
Why with my bicycle of course, they are use for offensive (RING RING YOU IDIOT) or defensive (RING RING I'M OUTTA HERE) actions
That's how the Germans beat the Dutch in WWII, by stealing their bikes
Poor Dutchies were completely powerless
How/why more consistent
Maybe I should have said "standard" English instead, the same way French from France is the standard version of French people learn, and not the Belgian, Swiss or Québec one
American English is perfectly valid and legitimate in USA, but I don't see why it should be elsewhere
I speak Belgian French, but I don't expect people to learn it outside my country
And if I'm abroad, I would use the French one, because it is the one that is legitimate internationally
Otherwise, using American English in Europe doesn't make any sense to me
British English is what I learnt, and it makes more sense to me
Saying "bathroom" or "restroom" is just a relic of American prudishness and Christian fanaticism; WC or Water Closet makes much more sense, toilet is better too
Z's instead of s's look like mispelling, as z is a loan letter
In my country, what you call a "college" (called "haute-école" here, as a "collège" is a Catholic secondary school, so, a school where people from 12 to 18 y.o go) ) is seen as something quite different from a university, and thus, grouping them both with the same name is odd; college =/= university, two different goals : one gives you a professional degree, teach you a job, the other gives you an academic degree
If we have to call them collectively, there is a more accurate term : higher education
Because it is the standard English
Why would we learn American English in Europe
When you learn French, you learn French from France right
Not the one from Belgium, Switzerland or Québec
These are totally valid locally, but they aren't the standard version of the language
Same goes with American English : valid in USA, but outside of it, British English is the legitimate and standard one
I will one up you: the Belgian city of Mons/Bergen is a completely different word depending on which part of Belgium you are in (its the French/Dutch word for 'mountains')
If you are not aware of the meaning of those words, there is no way to make the connection
In Dutch, s and k are switched: Grieks
Norwegians used to say Grekenland, but like for sooooooo many placenames, they decided to make it fancier in the second half of the previous century
Another interesting thing that happened is British soldiers giving making dutch town names sounding English, but in doing so using real English nouns, so it has some (nonsense) meaning thus a link to reality
The only example I can think of right now:
Dutch: Ploegsteert
English: Plugstreet
It's very obvious there's a phonetical link between the names, but it's also unique they used real nouns: A plug and a street
I was quite amazed when I found out about this and I don't think this happened in other contexts
You also use the spelling from 1914, like Passchendaele instead of the contemporary Passendale
> English uses the French name for a lot of Belgian cities, including some Flemish ones
There's an evolution to move away from that and use the Dutch name for Flemish cities
So while in older English texts you often saw *Malines*, *Louvain* or *Alost*, nowadays it's Mechelen, Leuven and Aalst
The names of *Bruges* and *Ypres* are of course too engrained now so those will probably remain
"Ghent" is based on old Dutch spelling, but it also happens to emphasise that it's not pronounced like the "gent" in "gentleman" :)
I think this varies by region
I'm from East-Flanders, and nobody uses Firenze here
Dutch: Aken
Some more:
Wallonia: Tournai = Doornik, Mons = Bergen, Braine-l'Alleud = Eigenbrakel, Nivelles = Nijvel, Soignies = Zinnik
France (although nowadays the French name is used more): Valenciennes = Valencijn, Cambrai = Kamerijk, Douai = Dowaai, Roubaix = Robaais
Don't forget Charles V's birthplace Gante (Ghent - Gent), he was also raised in Malinas (Mechelen)
Underrated comment
I mean I'm East-Flanders too (close to Ghent), and didn't even know that it was a thing to say "Florence" in Dutch
Your point still stands, I guess
But it's not that in East-Flanders nobody uses "Firenze".
English doesn't have words starting with unaspirated p. The closest pronunciation would be "Baitching" or something
As a Catalan, unaspirated p and aspirated p might sound similar, but a Chinese would disagree
Some Chinese people don't listen to how voiced a sound is, they only distinguish aspirated and unaspirated
English speakers say "Bay Jing". This pronunciation is perfectly fine
Dworp = Tourneppe
Well, in Dutch at least, Peking is stressed on the first syllable, while Beijing is stressed on the second one
I can hear the difference between [ɕ] and [ʃ] well, however, I find it hard to hear a difference between [ʃ] and [ʂ]
This last sound is one that I definitely mispronounce in Swedish
To a Chinese person, the English word spill sounds like "sbil". You are right that they won't think of [ʃ] as [ɕ], but English doesn't have a sound that looks more like it
[k] sounds even less like it
Maps
me is pretty well known among travelers for being very detailed all over the world
Absolutely not, both of them are correct in the context of a conversation
Britanique is grammatically and phonetically correct, and I've been in tons of situations in which I've heard francophones refer to you guys as "les Britaniques".
Nop, that's straight-up weird
Tough, just like how some francophones might refer to the United States as "Les US" instead of shortening les États-Unis (which would result in EU, bringing even more confusion), you might also stumble upon French speakers simply referring to the United Kingdom as "UK".
As an example : "J'suis parti aux UK pendant les dernières vacances".
Nah it doesn't get shortened at all, most francophones tend to refer to the EU simply as "l'Europe" (making no distinction between the EU and the European continent), but then again, I come from Belgium, which is a very europhile country
However, I've heard Frenchies refer to the EU in casual talk as l'Europe as well, and to my knowledge, l'Union Européene is only used in formal and official contexts
In a casual conversation
I've never heard it to be quite honest, but I might be mistaken
Yw pal
Belgium
1: a couple of small lighters
10: a large crate of beer
100: some real nice headphones
Man I hate how expensive fastfood is over here
A take-out pizza will set me back 12 to 20 depending on the size
In Dutch:
> - F is voor fakkel die alles in brand zet;
> - U is voor uraniumbommen;
> - N is voor niet overleven
Translated literally:
> - F is for torch that ignites everything;
> - U is for uranium bombs;
> - N is for not surviving
Almost exactly the same
Now I remember why we would usually watch the german dub
Cursive
I find it crazy that some people don't learn it, or don't start with it
It's so much quicker to write
To me, handwriting is automatically and always cursive
Cursive, that's the only way we are taught to write
Personally, it takes me hours to write in print script, i can't do it fast, and it is rather ugly
With cursive, it's much easier to do callygraphy, to write nicely
I learned handwriting first if that's what you mean
exactly
Same
It actually kinda sucks because mine is not particularly legible
I wish I could write in print without it taking hours
Cursive is normal hand writing though, hand-writing print letters is the not normal thing
I didn't know the word until I saw it here on Reddit
It's simply when you link your letters when you write words, while print is when you write each letter individually, without connection to the others
We are planning to take a trip to salzburg and read somewhere that there and in berchtesgaden they filmed the sound of music
Can you elaborate
Should I be mindfull of something
Isn't this just an Irish travel review
Ah man, the pints were 10 quid
Never going back there
I mean, it's pretty common knowledge to avoid establishments near tourist highlights, unless you don't care about quality or price
Why would there be anything wrong with octopus
It's some pretty good food if you ask me
Honestly, they're just too damn creepy for me
They're like the alien spiders of the sea
Isn't that like everywhere
Fried octopus rings and such seems about as common as chicken nuggets if one doesn't count McDonald
Basically available in most places that have cheap, friend food for you to pick out
Also, why the fuck would eating basically anything be weird
Uncommon
Maybe
But not weird
I actually love the taste of it
I had very delicious octopus salad in Portugal, but have not had the guts to order a whole one
It still freaks me out a bit
West-Flanders for being farmers who literally nobody understands and Limburg for being slow and calling [this] a 'long hamburger'.
In Flanders definetly West Flanders, which is where I'm from
For Wallonia I do not really know for sure, but I have heard jokes about nobody living in (Belgian) Luxembourg
I'd say Charleroi
The airport is named "Brussels-South" because if you tell passengers they arrive at Charleroi, they wouldn't want to get out of the plane
It is sometimes said it is a dirty city because of the many coal mines that were created in the region
The is also Herstal, near Liège, were one can find the finest barakis (a more or less equivalent of rednecks/gopniks/beauf/racaille/you name it) of Wallonia
Unfortunately, I can't say much about Flanders, maybe someone can help
Limburg is often portrayed as being backwards
Hela, ik ben van regio Maasland en daar zegt niemand lange hamburger, dat hoor je vooral in Zuid-Limburg ^^
Then we have people from Antwerp (city) who think they are the centre of the world's attention
They have a phrase that goes: "Antwerp is the city and the rest is parking space".
People from Ghent are progressive vegetarians who ride bakfietsen (bikes with a container in the front) and lot of them are students
People from Aalst are people who live on the margins of society, hence the nickname 'Marginaalst'. They're also famous for their carnival, which is quite vulgar
Leuven is full of students, more of the posher kind, but nothing else
The town is basically dead during the holidays
Brussels is either full of radical Muslims (Molenbeek) or Francophones who hate Flemish people and speaking Dutch
Liège has this weird love affair with France even though French radicals burned down their cathedral during the French Revolution
They also like to think they are different than the rest of Wallonia
People from Namur are rather slow (Walloon Limburgers) and that's why they have a snail as their symbolic animal
Charleroi is a depressing place and people who can afford to leave it do
Industrial decline at its finest
And Wallonia
It's not so much the provinces and more the cities (like Charleroi and Liège, especially the former) that have reputations for having a lot of "barakis". Luxembourg is empty and people from Namur speak super slowly
It's a curryworst
Or as it's widely known as frikandel
Ah dat wist ik niet
Maasland's got its own kind of problems though
The Liégeois destroyed the cathedral Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Lambert themselves
At the time of the révolution liégeoise which began simultaneously with the French Revolution in 1789, the merchants who saw the cathedral as a source of cheap raw material influenced the revolutionaries who thus made the decision to destroy it
Plus it was considered a symbol of the Prince Bishop's power
The destruction began in 1795, the place remained a heap of ruins for more than 3 decades until 1827 when the place was finally leveled
A huge loss since this jewel of Gothic architecture culminated at 134
5m high, making it the tallest cathedral in the Benelux
Since the new Republic of Liège was not well received in Europe at that time, the Liégeois voted to join the French Republic, hence their connivance (this and other things later such as the world wars)
Frikandel are not the same as currywurst
We don't know what is inside of the Frikandel
Huh interesting, I thought the French did it considering that it happened during the French Revolution
It's very rare for a religious site to be completely destroyed by the city's own inhabitants
Yes it's pretty rare because that's stupid
but they did anyway
Yeah I know that but I am sure that it's not curry
Frans-Vlaanderen terug Vlaemsch
Kamerijk voor de Graaf
We have a lot of things to improve in Europe too, but, no, I would not live in the US
The main reasons are : gun problems, impossible health costs, limited polical choices and to many religious nuts
No, I wouldn't. For living in a first world country, it just doesn't sound like an improvement in any way
It would ask too many sacrifices without getting anything back in what I value
If I would move to another first world country, it would be to a country with much higher standards on equality, health care and education among others
These things seem to be ok in the usa if you're rich, which I'm not
No, my reasoning behind it is that the US is capitalistic and imperialistic
This conflicts with most of my world views
You're goverment is always looking for war/conflict and it does not matter if you have a GOP or DEM president in office
Also looking at how you your country treats immigrants/asylum seekers from the southern regions how would you want me to live in a country that actively separates mother and child
They are just looking for a better live for their children
You either deny them at point or accept them
Not this "punishment".
So no thanks, I rather stay in my little country
This is why i would not want to live in the US
In some cases even with health insurance, medical bills are through the roof
&#x200B;
Well I'm trans, so no
Also, I'm poor, so no
Oh and I'm not much of a capitalist, so no

Because it's really hard to become a citizen of Monaco
In belgium we have the same, but the other half work 40 hrs
40 hrs do included overtime which you can take as a holliday or as money
Some even work 50 hrs and more
Ofcourse they do, well at least in my family
Even about their period and the kind of anticonception they use(d) and that worked or didn't work for them
I don't ask them about it, but as a guy I don't think those subjects should be taboo if they want to talk about it
I think this is somewhat the same across the country
Edit: Funny how a comment about a subject about this can turn into a huge debate, only because I used a less known synonym for birth control
Not one comment about the subject-matter, only about a single word I used
Nice
My (M) mum loves talking about her pregnancies and how easy or difficult her labour was depending on the sibling, so I never thought of it as a "touchy" subject for close family members
I guess it's different if a woman miscarries or if she goes through a postnatal depression
Both are correct
Me too
Anticonception is clear 'anti' 'conception' while contraception comes from 'contra'  'conception' -> contraception
Germany is Duitsland
Estonia is Estland
And the lands south of Estonia are Letland and Litouwen
If you're going to literally translate Duitsland, it's Germanland rather than Dutchland
Latvia is Lettonie
Leeuw van Vlaanderen  by Hendrik Consience
Hendrik Consience was a Flemish writer is is considered to be the writer who taught the Flemish to read
(1812-1883)
'In Flander's fields' is also a good contender imo
I learned wah more about that than about de Leeuw van Vlaanderen at school
But it's not written by a Belgian so I get why it couldn't really be a national poem
I would say Tijl Uilenspiegel for al Dutch speakers
Nevertheless, thats a great suggestion aswell
yeah, i would go more with this or even reynard de vos
De leeuw van Vlaanderen is too politicised
Then again, with our country being split along linguisitic lines, its next to impossible to have a true national poem
Maybe the wonderfully Belgian website of [houtinfobois
be] or something truely bilingual
Boars,deers and wolves but not in my region tough
About the wolves a "funny" story: a year ago the first wolf was spoted  and a few weeks later another one
Iwas taking a shower in the morning and they were talking about the second spoted wolf on the radio a few hours later they said the wolf died becaus some one drove him over that day
The only wild animal I see “regularly” is a hedgehog
I’ve seen 2 deer here in the wild in my entire life
It’s depressing how little wild animals I see here in Belgium
Oh and rats, RATS EVERYWHERE
Disgusting little pests annoy my chickens
It’s a plague
Meanwhile in my usual holiday spot in Germany I have to watch out when I walk the dog at nightfall because then the giant ass deer start to roam around
You have to be careful when driving because foxes cross the street day and night
You need to be extra careful for deer because they move around in large groups once nightfall starts so you encounter them both by car and by foot
Conclusion:
Belgium: only rats & Hedgehogs
When I’m in Germany (Harz region): foxes & deer everywhere
We know it was accorded to them because of corruption, and yet they are still allowed to organise it
We will be playing soccer in the fucking desert in a country that gives not a single fuck about the sport, they had to shop together a national team FFS
I hoped that nations would boycot it but that would require having a spine
it sucks  :
\-timing
\-heat
\-human rights violations
The Qatar team is actually quite decent, they even won the last AFC Asian Cup, the Asian equivalent of the UEFA Euro tournament
And as someone else said the level of the national team shouldn't be the deciding factor to choose a host
But I agree on the corruption part, ofc they bribed FIFA to host it
I won't watch it either
The Qatar national team isn't that atrocious really
Of course no Russia or Germany or Brazil, but I don't think that should matter really
If somehow San Marino manages to have all infrastructure etc to organize a competent World Cup, I'd gladly see them play there
And several died in the construction of some stadiums I believe
For me, it really depends on the country
I found that Sweden and Denmark have quite a good cuisine, although not as varied as others
On the other hand, I view Norway as the darkest pit of culinary doom
But true, the Southern European food is just delicious
I don't really know why, it's just what I (and most people I assume) like best
It's pretty much unknown, but not considered to be boring or bland
My first guess about what to expect is a very wide variety of seafood and probably a variation on what's Knödel in austria
I don't know that many Scandinavian (or northern european) restaurants, but those we have in Brussels are considered to be top class
I don't think Belgian/French food is boring at all
Climate and Protestantism
Sure, not being able to grow a frivoulous olive or sunny peach plays a huge role, But don’t ignore the sober and austere mentality of Protestants: ‘It’s only supposed to feed you, not taste good’. As opposed to the indulgences and follies of the Catholics
That's just because spices were not as available than today
Today, everyone can add that hint of spice to make the meal more exciting
Italian nonna's make the best
Period
It was obviously exaggerated as a joke, but I have traveled twice in Norway (1998 and 2006, so that isn't very recent) and I don't remember anything interesting about the food
There was good fish of course, but that is a bit generic for all Northern countries
Products with blackberries were nice too
I also remember some stuff (I'm not sure what it was exactly) that we really didn't like and used as bait for fishing
Overall, the main thing I remember is that it was super expensive and not-so-good
Same with Iceland by the way
The quality/price ratio was far lower than what can be found in Southern countries
edit: I remember about elk or deer sausage too
Saint Empire Romain Germanique
There's both "Roman" and "Germanic"
Oddly enough, despite the fact Romance-speaking Belgium was part of it from its foundation until 1795, like the French people we call it too "Saint Empire Romain germanique" (Germanic HRE), despite the fact there were many non-Germanic parts in it, including us
That must be a Netherlands thing because in Belgium we say Heilig Romeinse Rijk
How do you distinguish it from the actual Roman Empire
TIL
In recent times I've seen a lot of cases where dutch in the Netherlands differs from that in Belgium in small ways
Very interesting imo
In Flanders we have TAK: Taal Aktie Komitee, they mainly try to keep the cities bordering Wallonia completely Dutch
They will paint over the French city name for example
But they are generally known for trying to keep Flanders a completely Dutch-speaking country
It's not like they will invent new words, but they insist on using the less popular Dutch words if they exist
They are definitely part of the Flemish movement, so most members will also vote for Vlaams Belang or N-VA
Er is toch geen enkel probleem met faxen en cancelen

We actually use it in automation work, when we put the program into the automates
when I was a kid I thought cum was the past tense of "to come" which made for some awkward convos looking back
Trough, though, thought, taught, tough, touch, etc
For the life of me, I can't remember how to writ awsner the right way
I know I just wrote it wrong, that's just how it comes out every time
Word and world
So similar
I know what the words mean and I never get confused by their meaning, but I often mess up when I speak
Eddy Wally, nah its Tintin
Our king literally made Spielberg a honorary knight cause he made a movie about Tintin
And also we have everything Tintin, Tintin chocolate, Tintin planes, Tintin trains, Tintin museums (multiple)
Pater Damiaan who helpt people with a deadly disease (don’t now how to say it in English) on an island where all the sick where just dumped and when he got the disease as well he kept on helping them and he made houses and tools for the sick until he died from the disease himself
Didn't even know that
WW2 still directly or indirectly has an impact on the entire world today so yeah
In belgium some flemish nationalists still refer to ww1 when there where foot soldiers whom were dutch speaking and could not understand or speak french, were given orders in french
Also i think, i am the last generation of people that still had family that was old enough during the war to remember it and to tell stories concerning ww1 and ww2
So there is a generation of people being lost whom still had certain personal stories and memories to the war
History books will discuss in great detail how the appointment of BoJo to deal with Brexit lead to WW3
Not specifically culturally isolated, but lots of posts on /r/chronicpain and /r/migraine are about stuff related to US healthcare and I really can't relate to that whatsoever
I feel quite sorry for them to be honest; it's already incredibly rough to survive through everyday life with chronic migraines and chronic pain and I can hardly keep my healthcare stuff and general paperwork up to date, because my head is out of business for half of the time due to the pain - I think I would've completely drowned in the US system and drop dead out of sheer misery
Yes, I especially hate the US-centric identity politics and how there's a silent implication that the US is the only relevant country for race related issues
Like if you bring up a criticism on their ideas of progressiveness / liberalism they go bonkers and assume you're a US white male
And they just stop replying or just can't really grasp the fact you're from europe and have such an opinion, since they also prop up western and northern europe as the perfect regions of socialism and democracy lmao
Which ironically makes them very bigoted in my eyes
I notice this behavior a lot, like speaking in place of cultures they don't really understand but claiming to defend
It fits into my overall idea about (of course, not all
but generally my experience) Americans as friendly, but EXTREMELY concerned with what people think of them (while they will simultaneously claim they don't), so it can be a very fake kind of friendly, and they will do stupid things to get acknowledgement from their peers I guess
This post went a little out of scope and became a rant about americans here haha, just want to conclude with I love interacting with americans who visit Belgium and this is something mostly confined to reddit
Someone else said something similar (e: /u/knorknorknor ) but I have trouble agreeing with the American premises of life
For instance their addiction to self-help in all books and quotes subreddits
It's always the story of how you solve all your problems through sheer individual will
I think we have much more the reflex of saying you need to rely on your friends and loved ones in though times, and that often change needs to be done in the environment around you and not "your mindset". But if you tell that to Americans many would consider you fatalistic or a leech to people around you
Also the partisanship of their politics is weird as hell
It's like a political discussion can't be abstracted from the two parties in power
>I was obviously lying as well as a hipster when I said I didn't know anyone who eats their fries with ketchup
My dad threatened to disown me everytime I put ketchup on my fries instead of mayonnaise

Adopted a senior myself a month ago
I would get 10 senior cats if I could, but [this lovely lady] doesn't like to share human attention (does great with other cats when no humans around though) and would get upset and frustrated if I'd get another cat, or dog, or kid, or whatever :p
A Fiesta from '99 :)
the best way to enjoy this sub is to forget it and then suddenly have a post "Enjoy this TIGHT pussy"show up in your front page
I had a dream last night about how my cat was all happy rolling around in the grass in a big garden and now I'm thinking of moving
Absolutely
I even feel like my personality while speaking English is effecting my personality in my native language
It doesn't change my personality at all
It's just a language
Yes, I become more social, I find it easier to socialize with strangers in English
Probably because I went to study abroad 2 times where automatically you become more social, and I still associate English with being in a social mood or something
I have had conversations in English with random people that I can't really imagine myself having in my own language, to be fair
It's pretty strange
*Sapir-Whorf hypothesis intensifies*
I speak 5 languages, does this mean I have 5 different personalities
With that accent it's pretty hard to take a Dutch person serious when he's angry
Quite the same in Belgium, we always ay that it's good money even if it's not extremely high
Brussels: Ugly, pollution, corrupt, traffic jams
Antwerp: harbor, drugs, arrogant people, diamond industry, Jews, also pollution, also traffic jams
Ghent: liberal, students, canals, old architecture
Bruges: tourists, canals, old architecture, football
Charleroi : airport, dirty, collapsed industry
Leuven: university, Stella
Old  buildings from 1700 where you can live in
Adding some for the south:
Dinant: saxophones and kayaking
Durbuy: smallest city
Brussels: a lot of immigrants (like every capital), tourists, EU capital
Bruges: **Chinese** tourists
Charleroi: poor
Liège: students, oufti, nightlife, train station
Namur: pretty, university, slow, government
Louvain-la-Neuve: student city, university, pedestrian-friendly, special architecture
We had a few "grenade attacks" around antwerp, supposedly drugs related
Huge drug import problem due to the port, mostly cocaine from Latin America
Drug traffickers were left alone for decades, the current city council started a war on drugs, this stirred some shit, and now drug gangs fight for their niche on the streets at night with hand grenades, mostly in residential neighbourhoods, blowing up cars of their rivals, for intimidation and to discourage politicians on the war on drugs by swaying public opinion
Almost always only material damage
Same story hits the national news every other week
My man
To add to that you also have
Louvain La neuve: Study town
Kinda like Leuven except in French
Mons: I actually have no clue but apparently it’s big (duh) and i’m pretty sure it was the culture capital of europe at some point
La louvière: Pretty much like Charleroi except way more crummy
This is new to me
By the way, I did a quick Google search of the drug capitals of Europe
And I found this article of the [Daily Mail]
Unsurprisingly, Antwerp came in third
The interesting thing is, they put a Dutch flag next to it
To who
They discover more drug networks than before, they catch and arrest more drug lords and corrupt port workers, and they discover record amounts of drugs in cargo containers, but it seems it only shows how big the problem actually was and still is
So depending on who you ask, it's working but it will take a very long, sustained effort, or it's not effective and it's only making the city unsafe for innocent citizens
I think that more countries will join (Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro etc) and not a lot of countries will follow the UK
At least here in Belgium, the we-should-leave-the-EU-sentiment has almost vanished since the Brexit
Because more countries will join, the structure will probably change - but I have no idea how it could change
I also think the EU will continue harmonizing more and more laws, even in private law, so the differences between law in different countries will become smaller and smaller
For me i hope it falls apart, that a lot more will leave
Europe is not that good in my eyes, costs too much money and they abuse their power in the EU parliament by coming in signing and leaving directly just to collect their money
They will enforce new rules and taxes that aren’t needed
Just my opinion
the next top-5 contributor is ready to leave
But sssst dont even try to get it into your brain if you were on state-propaganda the last years
the old xenophobes voted Remain
Private law is for example the laws concerning contracts
They’re already slowly starting to harmonize those laws
I mean that they come in put their autographs in the book collect the +300€ for the day and leave within 5 min
Thats what i meant with abusing power
I still believe a country is it strongest on their own not to dance for others
The whole system needs to change
Since the Euro was introduced everything went to shit and got a lot more expensive
And then there is that drunk that’s head of the EU
I never believed in it and it never will
The only positive is that you can travel without stopping at every border
But that’s all for me
The EU has cost us all a lot of money for some stupid elites that don’t care for people of lower and mid class
IIRC you can't join the EU with ongoing territorial disputes
Unless they're super tiny, or you're Cyprus
Yeah, I think so too, especially for contracts between people of different countries (which often happens when buying stuff second-hand online)
It's like that everywhere
I blame the lack of political subjects in school
If young people would've been taught about the political system at school, they would show more interest and actually vote on stuff that concerns them
Instead it is left up to them to discover it and as a result, the older generations will always have a heavier turnout (relatively) then the young ones
I say scrap the two hours of religion in the schools, and replace it with one hour of philosophy (in which you can include religious teachings) and one hour of politics
It’s not that you don’t want to invade countries, it’s that you can’t : Just try to invade India, with their army and nukes, or Africa and their suicidal guerrileros
Plus it’s better to exploit their economy by installing puppets at their heads rather than developping them with infrastructure and things like that, which cost money
Same thing for us, except when Leopold went ancap
Ssssshhhh no, it's al the British Empire's fault
C'mon now
Do you consider Bulgaria ruling a bunch of europeans land that were not Bulgarian an empire ?
I think another thing we must not forget is that Germany was not a good country led by a bad leader
Hitler was the result of democracy in action
There was resistance, but there was also widespread support
Many soldiers didn't commit atrocities because they had to
They did it because they wanted to
I don't say this because we should all be angry at Germans in 2020, I say this because it's important we know so we can see when it's happening again
I mean the USSR had a lot of qualities
You mean Northern-Belgians
« I think the germans learned the wrong lessons »
« They need to defend democracy »
Hello i’m american and the germans should do the same thing we do : 1

Warcrimes  4
Now it’s a perfect democracy
Enjoy, Iraqis
As a citizen of a country, you need to share the burdens of responsability

Not really, i think the roman legacy is more of an latin one, even if Italy is clearly the most important bit
What do portuguese think about Savimbi tho ?
Maat, die grap werd zoveel keer naar ons gericht

They can tho, don’t forget the mass orgy that was the roman empire and the many natives that were fully integrated into the roman society

Don't care about things happened in the past, a German Hakuna matata
I didn't even really know of this one
AND IT'S IN MY OWN LANGUAGE
That’s the first thing Belgian Dutch speakers will teach foreigners lol
A man of culture i see
Genau
Well, now I know
And I won't forsake my duty from now on
I have so many Gogos at home
I loved these little guys
I liked center parcs as a kid because of the amazing pools, now I don't like it anymore because I find the houses too small and especially the beds aren't long enough
But it's indeed nostalgic
Same ahahah
Don't watch the Geography Now video about Belgium
Half the episode is wrong
His other videos are great but somehow the Belgium episode is super bad
I think [this] is a pretty good video explaining why we're so divided, although it has some mistakes
There's [this guy] from the US that biked around Belgium visiting all of the trappist breweries
Can't get much more Belgian than that
It's also really well filmed and put together
Same
Not Just Bikes is awesome
Too bad for him he's stuck with us cause he said he'd rather have more global viewers who could learn a thing or two about Dutch infrastructure
I'll add here that there aren't really any good YouTubers about Belgium that I know of but [this] documentary is still one of my favorites
Belgium is a lot more than a few bad roads and some political anomalies, and it's about time people get that
Are there any video's/channels covering anything other than our complicated political system
It would be nice if there were channels/video's covering our food, local festivals or special sites within Belgium
Every video has mistakes, but it's not like almost half of the episode is wrong in most of his videos
I'm sure there are top 10 videos about 'things to visit' or 'things you didn't know about Belgium'. Also [a video about our Army] and [lots]  [of] [history] [videos] and one about our [languages] Just to name a few
However there's very few video's on cultural stuff
We have some peculiar stuff going which could be well suited to a short video
I imagine you could make a 10 min video on the festivities of Het Ros Beiaard in Dendermonde, or about the Gilles of Binche, where you can have some nice exposition shots while explaining the history about it
Right now I'm pretty sure Tom Scott has more exposition video's on Belgian peculiarities than there are video's made by Belgians
In another life, I would have gone into history in uni and I'm pretty sure I would be making them myself, however I went another path and can't really spare the time doing it myself
Yeah you're sadly right
Although I didn't even know Tom Scott has made videos about Belgium
Moved from Belgium to the UK about half a year ago, also to be with a loved one
Im not a fan of the UK much, but my partner and i try to make the best out of it
As long as you two being together makes you happy, itll be alot easier
But, if you really really dont like the country you moved to, you might want to discuss this with your partner and maybe see if you both could settle down somewhere in the future that you both like
I personally dont want to settle down in the UK, and neither does my partner, and we have discussed this before
It really helps to talk about it
[Rendez-vous by Pas de Deux]
The version they song after winning the Belgian nomination is even [more cringing] (starts at 2:39)
Oh that was a trainwreck indeed
Uhm, it's one of the best
Worst: so much to choose from
The most recent horrible one was Mother in 2014
That song actually aint bad tbh
That was actually funny
It's a common mistake countries who send joke entries make: if the joke isn't funny, you don't have a lot going for you anymore
Copycat in 2009 was leagues worse
Had nothing going for it
Not wearing them but usually they are planted on memorial, further more in Ypres and passchendaele
There is also the Daisy but I haven't seen it anywhere else than in the Ardenne
We don't even wear them in Belgium, where a big chunk of the battles were fought
And I don't think they do in France
It's solely a British thing to wear them
We do lay poppies near the graves of the soldiers of WO1 to remember the fallen
Only during the memorial day, and then only in Yper, I think
Theyre not worn alot, mainly on the coast during times to remember WW1, but they are in alot of places such as graves and monuments, because the poppy signifies Flanders Fields(yes, like the poem/song)
So while for us its a remembrance symbol for WW1, for the British its to remember their soldiers
As far as i know we're the only ones that really use it
Yes
One of the elementary schools in my village is even called "Red Poppy". But my village has a WW-addiction
Yes, because in French "Czech Republic" is already : Tchéquie, no one bothers itself calling it "République tchèque". So Czechia is much better name, much less tedious to say and write than "Czech Republic".
I mean, we don't go around saying "Kingdom of Belgium" instead of Belgium, or "German Federal Republic" instead of Germany, etc
so why make a exception for Czechia
I kinda do it on reflex anyway from Tsjechië to Czechia is just way easier to remember
Yes I like it because I don't see why we would call it the Czech Republic
Just like everyone says France and not the French Republic
Also, in Dutch we say Tsjechië so it makes sense to also say Czechia
Same as many here, it is called Tsjechië in Dutch which works fine
But "Czechia" in English just sounds odd yet doesn't have a good alternative
Suppose the main question is whether Anglophones can get used to it
Does it have to be the current country or do empires where we belonged to also count
Otherwise this is gonna be 1 sad game for Belgians
I really like the flags of our [Air Force] and of our [Navy] I also like the flag used by [the United Belgian States]
The one of the [Austrian Low-Countries] when what would become Belgium was part of the Austrian Empire
Bring back the empire already
The white one wins when it comes to royal flags, but your current flag is pretty hard to beat l. One of the best out there, such a nice shade of blue
I also don't like the gold in your flag
People say we stole your flag
As a symbol of nationalism
I actually like the flag of the [Belgian marine]
>the UBS
Yes bby inject that flag into my veins
Aesthetically speaking ofc
Which is kinda ironic, since the Belgian flag (1830) is older than the German flag (1871 or 1848 at best)
Yeah I know
I saw something today that said that Belgium actually has one of the oldest flags in tye world (like top 15 I think)
Yes and it's not even close with the second oldest
Have you never read or heard anyone say "ik gun het hem wel"?
That's actually a really good example
Imagine you like someone but that person gets in a (good) relationship with someone else
You are obviously *jaloers*, because you wanted that
That *jaloersheid* can develop in *afgunst* if you try to sabotage it with ill intent (negative), or it can stay healthy  because you see how happy they are and don't want to ruin it and try to let it go (neutral)
A positive example is that you are slightly *jaloers* of some because they are naturally good at something where you aren't as good at
For example, when I hear random people singing good or see them draw beautiful things I'm *jaloers*, because at that moment I wish that I was even half as good at that as they are
*Jaloersheid* can be accompanied by admiration, while *afgunst* never is
Wha in the netherlands too
I thought it was a dialect
Altho in West flanders we say: jalezienn (yes double n)
Fair enough
Jaloezie is pretty much used by everyone during daily life
Afgunst only has few uses these days
Not *that* rare though, I still hear it often enough
I'm from a town of 20k and when traveling say 30 kilometers away some people will notice the accent and ask if I'm from the town I am
Several dialects will get subtitled on television
I am not intimately familiar with the Dutch dialect groups from the Netherlands, but the Belgian varieties come in 4 large groups:
\- West Flemish
\- East Flemish
\- Brabantian
\- Limbourgish
And that's just a rough division, some of the dialects within each stand out (Ghent dialect is quite different from most other East-Flemish varieties)
It's quite rich considering how geographically small we are
Even worse
West Flemish is a protected language in France but not in Flanders
Accents aren't dialects
You have the same thing with French you know : only one official written form and official pronounciation
You just have different accents and a few local words, but as a whole, in Europe, French is very uniform
Antwerp is also big for fashion and cocaine
Also Antwerp is the place for the chemical industry
The news mentions both, but when talking about vaccines in general they say 'Phizer vaccine' for short
'based in the US'
Pfizer is an American company, but all the vaccine we and the rest of the world get is produced in Belgium
So it's not really a Europe vs
America thing, rather Belgium vs
Germany
Janssen is a Flemish company in the province of Antwerp
Let's see: Dank u, thank you, Danke, tak, takk, takk, takk (?) (ok maybe that's cheating a bit, don't know how you spell the Swedish one though), kiitos, merci, grazie, gracias, obrigado/-a, ευχαριστώ, spasiba (don't know how to write cyrillic)
Fourteen something
The ones I know are: merci, gracias, grazie, danke, dank u, díky, takk, tak, tack, thank you, ευχαριστώ.
I can say thank you in Dutch, French, German, English, Swedish, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Russian and greek, which makes 11 if I can still count
> Danish (and Norwegian if it's the same word)
And Swedish and Icelandic too then
Honest question, I understand that Scottish Gaelic is pretty moribund but are there many Scottish people who don't even know how to say thanks in that language
Glad to hear your optimism
I don't know any Celtic languages myself but I have fond memories of a trip to the Isle of Mull when I was a wee lad (aha), with beautiful Scottish Gaelic music playing in the car and picking up some of those beautiful sounds on the streets
And maybe it's only sensible to focus more on the preservation of the Scots language on the east coast instead of trying to forcibly introduce and try to educate a language that's been gone there for a long time, because that could create some hate for the language like in Ireland
Cheers
Quite ignorant
Bicky burger recently had a campaign in which a man slabbed a woman for “not giving him a real Bicky burger”, it got a lot of backlash as well because it promotes domestic violence

The park between the parliament and the royal palace in Brussels is full of patriotic symbolism but through the years it gained an extra one
The different roads in the park point (some on purpose others came later) towards the most influential institutions for Belgium
To the palace And the parliament, the European parliament, the palace of justice, the Brussels cathedral but also Belgium's biggest bank and the American Embassy
Do you know Louis De Geer "the father of the Swedish steel industry"? What do you think about the Walloon immigration to Sweden

Wait is it a long/big jump or several smaller one ? Also should we wear protective equipment ?
Belgian politicians take themselves too seriously to have any weird parties
In fact, they all try so hard to be normal that they end up copying each other for about 95% of their programmes
On the other hand, our entire political system is weird enough with 6 different governments, people I can't vote for because I don't live in the same part of our tiny country as those people becoming prime minister, ... Guess it's silly enough without the weird parties
The Pirate Party
It supports drastic reform of copyright law, the legalization of cyber-piracy, and the abolition of patents
As far I know, there are plenty of other pirate parties in the world, they even have some kind of international rally, and the Belgian one is a founding member
why are they not in power
I think VB would deffinitly fall under the catagory 'weird'
> Last election there was also the so-called pirate party
I have no idea  what their standpoints are but they didn’t make it either
There are  always some weird new parties every election
We also have a 'pirate party'. According to [wikipedia] they support "reform of copyright law, the abolition of patents, and respect for privacy
" It maybe isn't that bad
Yes
But also no
The government we currently have is one of "national union". It does not actually represent any majority of votes, and as such can't do much except manage the covid19 crisis
That said, even though I didn't vote for them (I literally can't vote for our current prime minister since she's from wallonia), I (and many others) think they're doing a pretty good job
Unfortunately, racist isn't weird
We also have the pvda who are pro communism which is equally weird as VB in my opinion
Both those extremes are weird tbh
>Later it turned out he was clucking their main program (infinite life, free beer) in Morse and ASCII code
That's dedication
>Australia
Really big geographically, but tiny in terms of population at 25m.
It's just crazy to think that the small region of Benelux has more people than all of Australia and Mongolia combined
Belgium has 11 million
Norway is empty lol
Java is 4,5 times the size of Belgium
No, unless you count "first class", which is just a bit more quiet than the rest of the train
The only quiet coaches I have seen were on the Brussels - Brussels Airport - Antwerp - Den Haag/Amsterdam train, which is a Dutch train and the quiet part is only first class as well
We don’t have them, but I wish we had
When I still used trains to go to school, the only quiet zone you could find was in first class or on the toilet (depending on the age of the train)
And the modern ones (Siemens Desiro I believe) don’t even have a separation between first and second class
It’s just two small glass screens at the end of the carriage with eight slightly nicer seats behind them
I don’t get why you would still want to pay an extra fee for such a barely noticeable increase in comfort
Oh I wish we did
How lovely would taking the train or bus be if we had some sort of unspoken etiquette rule that made talking on public transport impolite
No more ladies shouting in their phones on the bus
One can dream, right
I looooove romanian trains
I get to travel in 1st class for 5 euro in the pocket of the train guy
I get to help give food deliveries at 2 am on nightrains
Watch videos with the train guy on his broken ass nokia phone
I love having 8 hours delay for a 40min route
Its just
wild
A higher chance of having a place to sit
That's the only reason you travel 1st class, nobody pays more to have some drawings on the walls
yeah no it was horrible, as a local
id avoid trains like the pest
for me
it was a life changing experience
Gent is the safest and chillest big city in belgium
You have a lot of youngsters and students and the atmosfere is very nice
Apart from some tourist attractions you can also go out very well and there are a lot of fancy second-hand shops
Yep definitely Ghent, really nice atmosphere, a lot of beautiful spots and a nice city centre
Less touristy than Bruges, so it's still a city where you can really live
I lived in Ghent during my Erasmus, I'll definitely stablish there if I got the chance
600 000 isn't small though
And you forgot : it got Killepitsch
What do you think of Neuß? Spent a holiday there with my gf, and visited Düsseldorf too
My sister sends me memes from there regularly even when her German isn't that good
Second image is hitler with Saint-Nicolas Bruh
Reminds me of r/BELGICA where they mix up Dutch, French and German
Ik see que du est ein homme de kultur
Best filter is to just avoid the places you know many Americans are going to be
That's really the best answer I can give
I can give you a little rant about this topic as well, If you like
Here it is:
r/all is simply a nightmare
Avoid it at all cost
I had so many blocked subreddits at one point that it might as well have been my own front page
Same with most subreddits that aren't specifically aimed at a non American audience
I think we should have a genuine debate about whether or not to make a few more subreddits aimed at a European (or simply not American) audience, because most of reddit is cognitively or culturally inaccessible to me as a European
r/askreddit is a perfect example, and there are many more
Despite the name, it's really just r/askAmericanRedditors
There's the assumption of all the commentators that everyone is American in there
Even when avoiding the obvious topics where you know most comments you won't be able to relate to, you still run into American exceptionalism constantly
"Oh what, you don't know these weird acronyms of US secondary school subjects
What did you think this was, a subreddit where we cater to a worldwide audience like our description says we do
Silly foreigner
We're Americans and we're the only ones with opinions that matter
I want a subreddit that's like r/askreddit (where you can ask anything), but specifically aimed at a non American audience
r/askeurope is specifically related to matters about Europe and the European way of life and thus doesn't fill that niche fully
I sometimes go to /all to pass some time, and looking at my RES subreddit filters here's what I filter out: MMA, nba, hockey, DestinyTheGame, baseball, and imsorryjon
So apparently US sports that I don't know anything about anyway, and two subreddits that annoyed me enough to add them
exactly the same
When i first got reddit hte first thing I did was unsub to all the default subreddits they subscribe you to because they were all annoying
Found my own niche(s) and I second not having browsed all, I literally have no idea how to get there
So we should start r/asknonUSreddit
edit: I just did
Pls use it
What are the most memorable single-day field trips you went on while in school
For example, me being a Belgian, I still remember going to the chocolate factory of Coté D'or, visiting the Caves of Han and its wildlife park, driving around in the harbor of Antwerp, cycling the Vredesroute (peace route) in Ypres and visiting Fort Breendonk
Canterbury
We left our school at 8 am and got back around 8 pm
We were only in Canterbury for like 5-6 hours but it was an amazing day, probably because I had never been in England and was looking forward to that moment for years
We went to Lille once for a day
It was kinda scary because nobody speaks french well when they are 15
and there was some kind of protest and some of our schoolmates got caught up in it and had tear gas thrown at them
We went to [Xanten (Germany)] twice (During my first year of Latin, and the year after again for history when I changed courses)
Very cool stuff, seeing a lot of Roman leftovers so close to home
Fort Breendonk was also very impressive
The WWI things we did were rather underwhelming (except for the huge cemeteries)
Other schooltrips for like geography were very local and lame
"This is the highest point in the area", standing on a random rolling terrain element, 38m above sea level lmao)
I biked over it a million times to go to school, never noticed any elevation lol
1) Going to the holding camps of WW2
Torture chambers and all that
Some harrowing stories
2) We went to London
It was around midnight and our hotel had a limousine driver just sitting there
We walked up to him and went for a ride
10 kids all paying 20 pounds
We drank some champagne and such while driving through center London, to the London eye where we took a group picture, etc
3) Having a good drink around a campfire at night on a beach in Barcelona
Remember taking some glass of a girl when she's had enough and all that
2) and 3) weren't endorsed by teachers or the like
Just something we came up with
Good times
I don't think I really have one that sticks out
So here's the list of what I still remember:
We once went on a very sunny day to Ghent, to the Gravensteen (medieval castle) and afterwards to the Blaarmeersen (lake with beach)
It was a really enjoyable day
One day I want to visit the Gravensteen again, because I can't remember anything except for the fact that I thought it was cool/interesting
We also once went to [P]  (zoo) and  Bellewaerde (amusement park)
I also once went to Boudewijn Seapart (Seapark + amusement park) but I didn't really like it
I also remember it was very rainy, so that might have influenced the fun
In high school we had a 1 day trip to Canterburry, which was really fun and exhausting (we left at 5am and were back home probably at 3 am the next day) Also in high school a 1 day trip to Lille
These trips to Canterburry and Lille were mainly fun because you had the freedom to run around, exploring with a few friends without the teachers (and you had to run all over the place to answer certain questions)
I also went to Paris twice, once I visited everything in group
The next time I just hung around with a couple of friends, sunbathing in le Jardin des Tuileries
As a Belgian of course I went to Ypres, I feel like most Belgians had a school trip to Ypres at some point during their high school years
I went to visit Archeon, a historical park in the Netherlands (roman times, medieval times)
I just remember that there were people walking around in Roman attire and their was a reconstructed bath house
I wonder if I ever went to Bokrijk (historical park in Belgium)
I can't remember it, but I can't imagine that we would have never gone there with school
I'm pretty sure I did  Fort Breendonk  at some point, but I don't really have memories of when or how it was
A trip to Brussels, I really only remember visiting the Royal Museum for Central Africa and the The Royal Greenhouses of Laeken
I also really enjoyed the sports day where we did la descente de la Lesse (kayaking down the river Lesse)
I had done it once before and once after that too
And it's definitely not the last time I'm doing that in my life
During a sunny day it's really a fun and chill activity to do with some family/friends
Edit: added a few things
Côte D'or and Breendonk are there too
My memories from that era are too fuzzy to remember which field-trips were with school or with summer "camps", or which ones were from "classe vertes" or single day trips
We made a little leather wallet/purse in elementary school: I collected flippo’s/beyblade’s in it for over 6 years
Good memories in Bokrijk (& the playground next to it)
As a Belgian I also went to Archeon
I'm actually from the region close to the border with France, so it was super far (probably 2:30-3 hours in the bus) and I get car sick easily, it was horrible
But Archeon itself, eventhough I don't remember much about it except for the people dressed up as Romans and the Roman bath house, I do remember really enjoying it
School (at the age of 11, 14 and 18)
School for me
Teachers thought it trough informative videos and explanation .
We get a sex education at school
I also have an older sister who showed me her condom stash and told me to take them whenever I needed them
In primary class ages 10-11, it was done by our class teacher
In my secundary catholic school, it fell upon the biology/science teacher every two or so years with standard biology videos
These were the exact same they used in the 80's, but in hindsight they were very clear and honest in the information
There were also additional courses by an organisation which specializes in sex ed (Sensoa)
They would bring in games and visual aides to help get the message across, and they have sessions with students to discuss their attitudes towards sex, and to answer questions which may be too embarassing to ask your teacher
Fun fact, I actually volunteered for the organisation while in med school to have a sessions with kids in a secundary school
It was actually loads of fun
We helped clear up some misconceptions many kids had, and they really liked asking questions
5th, 7th and 8th grade
From basic questions to how periods work, fertility, hormonal and non-hormonal birth control, etc
They give it in school  ( when you are 11/12, 13/14 and the more biologic stuff 17/18) but sometimes parents do also ‘ the talk’ . And we have several good websites which are not porn, just educational
Similar to Belgium in that case but that's for age 13-14
In that year in biology we basically go over all "systems" in the body(digestion, blood, urine, lungs and yes, reproduction)
A part of a viaduct in Brussels was dismantled and rebuilt in Bangkok as a gift from the Belgian government where it is now called the Thai-Belgian Bridge
Thailand also has a similar friendship bridge from Japan
I think it's a cool form of diplomacy, to build something that is actually useful for another country (free of charge) is a powerful sign in my opinion
Hey, we also dance the Polonaise
We always danced on it on school when it's our local festival
I am half Luxembourgish - half Italian (from Sicily and Umbria) with a French and Belgian nationality
Living in Belgium, I identify myself as a Belgian with Italian roots most of the time and even if I feel close to the French through culture, I don't say I am French except when I am asked about my two nationalities
I don't speak Italian ( i'm still in process of learning it ) but I can understand it, because I haven't been totally cut off from my Sicilian origins, where I visit my family usually every year for two months and where I can still draw on some cultural references
I'm half Flemish and half Dutch
I identify with Belgium the most because i live there, but i also identify with the Netherlands, just not as much
i'm dutch but parents moved to belgium
im kinda considered a foreigner on both sides now
An opera in 1830, “La muette de Portici”, led to riots breaking out in Brussels that night and, eventually, the Independence of the Kingdom of Belgium
That we opened the sluises of Nieuwpoort during the beginning of WWI so everything was under water and the Germans couldn't go through
Then they were all stuck there for 4 years
'Native English speakers never say just "Yes" or "No". They always say "Yes, it is", "No, it isn't", "Yes, I would" and so on
The greatest lie ever told
Also, do French speakers ever say tu or nous
I feel like it's always vous and on, but I am not sure
We were thaught that there were 3 ways of asking questions in French:
*Intonation*: "tu viens
" (Basically a normal sentence but your voice goes up at the end to indicate it's a question)
*Est-ce que*: "Est-ce que tu viens
And *Inversion*: "Viens-tu
We could usually choose which kind we used, so everyone always used the one with intonation because it's the easiest
You just make a normal sentence and put a '?' at the end
It turns out (from what I've heard at least) that that is never used
Even the 'est-ce que' one is rarely used
Of course the hardest one, 'inversion', is used almost every time
Edit: I'm stupid
Inversion is almost never used, the other 2 are
I also remember learning this, although only the older English teachers thaught this
I am very sure it is spelled: J'sais pas
This is how it would be written in comics
In Dutch, it is always inversion :)
I always say qu'est ce que in French
Huh well now I'm happy but confused
I swear someone told me that
But good to know
In Dutch, the intonation thing is mostly used when you're surprised
Like where you'd react with 'Really
So for example:
"Je bent blij" = You are happy
"Ben je blij
" = Are you happy
"Je bent blij
" (With the emphasis on 'blij') means more like "Are you *really* happy
With that
How
Maybe it was someone from Quebec who told me that it is used then
The reason I found it the hardest is because with the other 2, you can just keep your regular sentence structure from when you don't ask questions
With inversion, you need to change the order of the words
So it was still the hardest, even though we also use inversion in Dutch
I like the dutch names but i like the french names even more
I also like the Dutch and French names
I don't like the English names like Brussels, Antwerp and Bruges, etc
I think it's nice that you can clearly see etymology in the Dutch names, like the suffixes -zele, -ingen, -gem, ... that give a view of the history of the place
I'm sure that's also visible in a lot of French names, but I'm not familiar with the etymology there
I also think the original Dutch names are better then the French for the regions around the language border
For example Zittert-Lummen > Zétrud-Lumay
Same goes for Dutch
Okay I can’t for the life of me figure out what the last two are supposed to be, pls help
Oh hahah wauw ik had ze gewoon luidop moeten zeggen dus
With 376/km² population density (vs 33/km² in USA), it is a bit hard to have a middle of nowhere in Belgium
In most cases, just walk a couple kilometers, and you'll find a village, or a house, or a town/city/municipality
However, the least densely populated area of the country is the [province of Luxembourg] and as well the most beautiful part of the country
My village literally has the nickname "outside of the world"
Well technically there are no 'middle of nowheres' in belgium
But every region has its redneck zone
Near leuven everything in the middle of triangle Aarschot-Diest-Tienen is called 'de marginalen driehoek' (marginal triangle, let's say a redneck area)
If you are from antwerp city, you consider everything which is not the city or a posh neighbourhood 'the parking'.
In the far west corner of westflanders (westhoek) is an  area called 'bachten de kupe' (behind the tub), it got it's name from ww1 where the whole area was intentionally flooded (hence kupe or tub)
Some parts of the [Westhoek] (province of West-Flanders) are also sparsely populated compared to other parts of Flanders/Belgium
It's like the time stood still in these villages, which makes it nice to walk/drive through
More than the province in it'self, you could point to the Ardenne since some part are really remote
I wouldn’t call it the most beautiful though (Bruges, Ghent etc
You are kidding right
Have you ever been in the province of Luxembourg or in the Ardennes
Landscapes and nature around Flemish cities are boring : flatlands, farmlands, and sometimes some small woods
I'm not talking about cities here
The province of Luxembourg, and the Ardennes, have the more beautiful landscapes and nature, rivers, cliffs, hills, forests
But even when it comes to cities, it has beautiful places that Flanders doesn't have, such as :
[Durbuy]
[La Roche-en-Ardenne]
[Bouillon] and its [castle]
And plenty of nice little towns and villages of the kind
If we open ourselves to the rest of the Ardennes and some parts of the Condroz, and not just Luxembourg you have as well :
[Dinant] Which is one of the most beautiful part of the country as a whole
Or you have as well Han-sur-Lesse near Rochefort, its caves and animal park
Flanders and its cities is the mainstream part for tourism, the one overexposed
But when it comes to nature, cuisine/gastronomy, picturesque towns that aren't overcrowded and were people are friendly, this is in Wallonia that you must go, south of the Sillon Sambre-et-Meuse
First of all, opinions can be different and yes I’ve been to all those places
I prefer alive and medieval cities with beautiful goth architecture
You might not like it, but at the end of the day; there is a reason why the northern part of the country has way more tourists
No one goes to Belgium for its relatively mediocre nature or dead southern cities, let’s face it
Also, Flanders is not friendly
This is just ridiculous and untrue, where the hell did you get that from
but most importantly, you’re going to act like these UNESCO’s world heritage cities are not picturesque
[Ghent ]
[Bruges, aka the Venice of the North]
These cities (and more so Bruges, but that obviously depends on the person) are often given the title of ‘the most beautiful’, so there must be some truth to it
You can bore yourself to sleep in those cities as much as you like, but for me and many others, beauty lies in the way a city comes alive and offers plenty of ways to take in its rich (!) culture
You were correct when you said it was the “middle of nowhere” in Belgium, but beauty is a subjective concept and I gave my personal opinion on the matter
In Belgium (especially north and center) towns are small cities and cities are big towns
Usually young people and those without kids go for appartements, those with kids usually go for a house with a backyard
I can't imagine there is a lot of difference between the 2 over here
Smaller towns are just a connection between bigger towns and the max distance you can be away form a big city is maybe 20 minutes
So you can live in a small town and be 20 minutes away from our biggest cities
Our geography teacher back in 11th grade once told a story about when he met his Chinese girlfriend in China
He told her he lived on the "country side". She's packing batteries and such but he meant he lived longer than 5 minutes from an inner city church
(he uses a bike to get to the city center of Ghent to teach so it's not exactly far from that either)
In most of Belgium, cities don't end the way they do for instance in the USA
The only way to know in Belgium when you are leaving one town is when there is a sign saying you have arrived in another town
The area between Brussels, Leuven, Antwerp and Ghent is called the Flemish diamond, because it is very urbanised, has a dense road network and you can almost never get more 10km from a town, and i think 10 is a lot
Our disastrous build policy doesn't help with that
yes, scandinavia is literally a breath of fresh air
I love visiting the northern countries
that is also a very impressive bicycle trip
Belgians live relatively large and poor town planning lead to all the connecting roads to be built shut too
That's why there is almost no free space in Flanders
In Wallonia the terrain makes it less dramatic and in the Netherlands they did do town planning properly
But lots of people need lots of homes ofcourse
In  Belgium very unpopular
Cycling and football are the main sports
Endurance on the cobbles
Hard and fun to watch
Isn't the entire cycling season going to be done over the next few months
Like even TdF and all big ones one after another
It's going to be curious which big shots will ride which races
It's a nice one though
When the package of milk is opened we keep it in the fridge but you can cool the bottle before drinking it as well if you like
We don't refrigerate raw eggs
Neither go in the fridge here
(milk when unopened, stays good for weeks, obviously goes in the fridge after it's opened)
/raise shoulders
I don't like cold milk unlike some here
It's mostly used for cereals for me
Eggs never go in the fridge, and milk only goes in once opened, or to chill before drinking
For storage milk generally stays in a storage cabinet, but not in a fridge
I never store these in the fridge unless they are sold in the fridge
(Eggs are somethings sold in the fridge and sometimes they aren't, depends what supermarket I go to
Milk is never sold in the fridge here, so I store it out of the fridge
When I open the milk, I put it in the fridge, obviously
Milk is the same
Eggs you buy unrefrigerated but once at home most people put them in the fridge
Milk is usually bought in a pack
The bottle we use goes in the fridge, the rest of the pack in the basement
Eggs always in the fridge
The tray is actually not so great since it's in the door (at least in my country it comes in the door)
Eggs are very sensitive to changes in temperature
When you open the fridge a lot and the eggs are at a tray in the door, they undergo a lot of different temperatures
If you store eggs in the fridge, don't do it in the door
In Belgium too, UHT is what most people would buy and use without even thinking about it
It's interesting to see what the [markets in different countries] look like
For Italian and Asian places, this is a well ingrained custom, but for other restaurants it isn't really that popular
They were promoting it a few years back with the cringy "restorestje" campaign, but not much has changed IMO
Portion sizes in most restaurants aren't excessive, so usually there is very little in the way of leftovers to be able to take with you anyway
I get the impression that in Germany it's more like 'this is the rule, and it is a good rule because it makes sense, and you should feel good if you follow the rules'.
Whereas the UK it's more like 'doing this will make me look upper class, so that's what I should do
Don't want to look like those lower class plebs'.
I feel like Belgium is somewhat in between, more like 'I will do the most sensible thing, as long as I still look middle class'. So we definitely have 'wrong' supermarkets (where it's embarrassing if you shop there, because you would look poor)
So you only go there once in a while to stock up on non-perishable food
But the rest of the time, you go to the 'right' stores, where you just buy a few items though
AZERTY
In Belgium we use AZERTY
And there are no special keys for letters like ë, ä, ö, ß, á, ... because we don't use that in Dutch except in some rare situations
Belgian AZERTY but I can programmatically switch it to QWERTY, mostly for when I'm gaming
The superior [Belgian AZERTY] which allows you to make these : *éèàùäëüïöÿâêûîôÂÊÛÎÔÄËÜÏÖ* easily, but as well *áúýíóìòÁÉÝÚÍÓÀÈÙÌÒ*, unlike the French AZERTY which is inferior to ours since French people have difficulties writting capital letters with the ´and ` accents/diacritics, or using said diacritics on *yuio* freely
We can as well make the *ñÑ* easily if wanting to write in Spanish
In summary, Belgian AZERTY is more practical to write French than the AZERTY they have in France, which is kinda ironic
Other characteristics are : the , is where the M is on QWERTY keyboards, and the M is next to L. we have as well the *ç* "letter", but unfortunatly we can't make its capital version aside from using the ALT+128 code
Really a superior keyboard layout to QWERTY and its very limited set of letters/diacritics
Unfortunatly, too many softwares and games developers ignore this better layout
Don't forget to precise that Belgian AZERTY and French AZERTY are different
My work pc is Azerty, but the rest is qwertz
I use azerty but I secretly prefer qwerty
Yup AZERTY, though unfortunately when writing a language like Chinese and using the pinyin input method, the keyboard changes to QWERTY (of couse not the letters on the button, just the function)
It is quite annoying to go back and forth between QWERTY and AZERTY because after a time I start to confuse them
It's also really annoying having to type punctuation marks in QWERTY while looking at an AZERTY keyboard
I just use the full stop from the number pad, but to get something else I always need to try some out before I hit the right one
You French fucks really fucked us Belgian gamers over
I worked at Switch (Easy-M back then) for about a year
We had quite a large stock of laptops and keyboards
In my memory we had about 80-90% azerty, with the rest mostly qwerty and one or two qwertz that didn't get sold
Our branch was kind of the de facto central stock, tech repair center and B2B, so we had a lot of overstock from other stores too
But being the B2B go-to for techies and pro's we had quite a stock of these programmer layouts that were qwerty, I believe it was the [Apple International English] layout
I think I sold about a handful of these in a year with iMacs
Makes me want to switch to international qwerty now, being a programmer today myself
Cmd + Shift + ( GANG
Had some Dutch classmates in my Uni in Belgium
They got frustrated using the library computers because of the AZERTY keyboard
In group work they made me type everything if we did it in school
Yeah true
I think we use the exact same AZERTY except that the French one has more text on it on some keys, whereas we just use symbols for those keys
AZERTY is better than QWERTY though
I would say the first French republic was quite close to pre-Christian Roman Empire/Republic
The French revolution has Greco-Roman Pagan heritage written all over it
The Cult of Reason was basically worshipping Athena/Minerva
I want you to battle /u/Rovanasa_Hill as to make out whether it's Vatican City or San Marino who has more claim to the heritage
Indeed, Napoléon ruined everything and destroyed the revolution and first republic
Meanwhile, in Belgium, everyone closes their curtains at sunset
My mom does this and I'm just thinking; "why would you want to shut out daylight while it lasts
I think you found a real-life exploit, my friend
Blame Christianity
If you are a Christian, it's a sin to work on God's rest day
ptdr magl
amazing, I almost wooshed
'k zien aa gère
Not as common as
"Euj geil mokke
Its the Flemish way of saying it
In NL Dutch, u is mostly formal
But saying “ik zie jou graag” just sounds weird/forced to me
Where I live its “kzien aa geire”. Where the aa is u.
In this sentence it's meant informal
I have never used the words "je" or "jij" in my life  - which are the proper informal words - when speaking to someone . Always used "ge" or "gij". But it's something Dutch people don't do
There is quite a shift in use of words below or above the Rhine actually
Affirmative
Belgium has a lot of very strong dialects, this is the Antwerp dialect which has a lot of French influences, because we are a trilingual country
That's too high brow for me
There not much difference between the languages
They're in essence the same
But there are a huge amount of small differences
Then again, there are equal amount of small difference between local dialects as well
To the point where some Flemings are more comfortable in understanding Dutch dialects compared to, let's say, a Bruges dialect
Last elections in Belgium were a disaster
They put all the winning parties ‘off side’ and created an alliance with the losing parties to keep their posts instead of passing them on to the winning parties
Now we have no goverment for about 4 months again and this isn’t the first time that this happens
No government for about 4 months
The previous government resigned over a year ago
We’re almost hitting that record again
And they don't want to held new elections because it would be even worse than
What do you mean the winning 'parties'? N-VA was the real winner and they are part of the coalition
The other party that won votes in the election was VB but you didn't seriously think that anyone would form a coalition with the Fascists, did you
The way to form a government in case you aren't aware is to represent over 50% of the people
A combination of smaller parties is as representative as 2 or 3 bigger parties
I don’t keep track of it, was a rough guess
Jup, r/belgica
Don’t overestimate the regional governments, they can still only decide on topics that were assigned to them
The residual power is for the federal government
And how do you expect Belgium to keep existing as a country if the regional governments have to do everything instead of the federal government
The federal government is responsible for finances of the country, the army, the justice system, social security etc
And don’t worry, at this point I honestly don’t see it keeping existence either
Its kind of a mix here
Lots of people like a tan, but not having one isnt considered unheqlthy
Some people just dont tan (they just burn)
I myself tend to be fairly pale (blue eyes too) but I do tan fairly if I wear sunscreen
No sunscreen= burn
I’m ginger, and yes most people tend to think i’m british while on holyday, (i speek english with a brittish-ish accent, am ginger, burn like a petrol fumes and rarely get a tan (this year was the first year of me getting a light tan, without changing skin right after
Accents are very thick in Flanders, and have some connotations, people from West-Flanders are seen as farmers (also they can’t pronounce the g for some reason), people with an Antwerp accent are seen as cocky assholes, and people from Limburg are seen as dumb, because they speak very slowly
Accents from Limburg and Western Flemish are meme material
The last one usually gets subtitles as well
West-Flemish, then you're a bit of a backwards farmer
Limburgs, kinda funny because they speak somewhat slow
Is there anything that gets said about Vlaams-Brabant actually
I feel like in Flanders it's rare to encounter someone that *doesn't* have an accent (except on tv)
Gerrit Callewaert intensifies
We're the normal ones
Not really
I do it occasionally and I don't give a fuck if people find it weird
Yes, except when it's a real cheap resto or fastfood
But nobody really cares
No, because bail our bounties in general are non-existent
There can be some sort of reward if you have a tip for the police, but you will never be allowed to apprehend/arrest someone
we don't, cause that's fucking mental
I was surprised my French SO never ate canned halved peaches filled with a tuna-mayo mix
Apparently it's typically Belgian
Also paling in 't groen, Gentse waterzooi and vol-au-vent
Snert with pieces of smoked sausage and baked bread is the best winter meal
Yeah, but zuurvlees is beef I think
Haven't had that in a long time
Just a bit too sour for my preference
That could be true yeah
Not that much horse meat is being used these days
Mainly some regional sausages and charcuterie that I know of use it still
13 but actually more
a total of 50 bellfrys spread arround the whole country and parts of France are grouped as a single world heritage site
13, including La Grand place de Bruxelles, one of if not the most beautiful city center in the world !
We have 13, but our beer culture is considered immaterial world heritage, which is pretty cool
Didn't know about that
Dang, that's quite a lot for our small ass country
Belgians definitely know what the Wadden Sea is
Especially the Flemish and we account for 2⁄3 of the population
People who say lange hamburger deserve to get drowned in the Maas
Some people think that a [frikandel] is called a 'curryworst' (despite not containing any curry), and in the far east there are even people who call it a 'lange hamburger' (= long hamburger)
I agree
I'm from W-Vl and everyone is calling a  frikandel ( just like your picture) a frikandel, obviously it is the best name for it
Was looking for this comment
Curryworst for the win
Ne frikandel is een balleke
I'm not a native French speaker so I probably have no say in this debate, but just for some extra fun:
**Couque au chocolat
Fuck that shit
I call it "een glacéke" and love it to bits, but eating it
And then there's my grandma, who always goes "that's too big, you should cut it in two and share it" before exploding custard everywhere
Curryworst the and only correct word
Frikandel is voor dirty Hollanders
Frikadel is a meatball
Frikandel is a curryworst
Tzijn enkel de Limburgers die dat zeggen hoor, wie anders
How dare you
Haha in mijn dialect zeggen we enkel frikadel, misschien daarom ;) de eind -n wordt hier niet uitgesproken
Have heard that, too
I do not agree
It has no spine thus can't be a book
No no not Münster, anything but Münster, please
I spent a week in that region and Münster was all I got to eat and all I smelt the entire goddamn time
Honestly, I like the -ium at the end more than the Dutch "België" or the French "Belgique" or the German "Belgien".
Belgium is good
Belgica, no real reason but it just sounds epic to me
Braveland, in reference to Caesar's quote
Or Atomium, in reference to our monument, and to keep the quite unique  -ium ending
Or Beerland, because we are the only country with decent beer
Lol we already have  3 names for Belgium so I don't really care honestly
België / Belgique / Belgien
Any name would be less of a profanity compared to "Belgium"
In older Dutch we called it Hispanje, but for some reason it's just Spanje now
[I mean
In Dutch we call it Polen, but we use the same word for poles (as in the north and south pole), so I don't think it's a good name either
Belgica is even better imo
But I agree, the English name sounds better than the Dutch, French and German one
Why not change it to flemish ;)
No, Czechia doesn't have the variety and diversity Belgium has
All Czechia has is pils
Sorry, but German beers are so light that they are more like lemonade for grown-ups
Gaylord
Kevin
It's such a whitetrash name in my country
I love Saoirse as a name
But I know I would burden a child with everyone just pronouncing it wrong etc
Same
I really love Saoirse
But if I would have a daughter, it would be a burden, not a name
So what name did you end up picking
I personally try to avoid because I think it's trashy, but a lot of people absolutely do (though I must admit Supreme is not that big of a thing here)
I think people try to avoid overly obnoxious or large logos but not just logos as a whole
[This] is what most of my t-shirts more or less look like
I walk into some clothing store, grab a few t-shirts with nothing too much on it every few years
France
Now they are just a country filled with bad middle lane drivers in my eyes
Even worse than here
I used to be fascinated by Germany, I learned the language, read a lot about the history (pre 20th century tho) and even listen to the traditional music (I still love German folk music)
But then I met them and I thought they were the most boring, bland people ever
Still today I'm still heartbroken about that and no German I met since helped change that
Well at least it's according to classical tradition
I remember reading an ancient Greek text somewhere and the author was also complaining that, apart from a few monuments, Athens was just ugly, overcrowded and unorganised
Interesting argument but you can also look to this through a different lens and reverse this argument
If we other European countries make the international news it's usually not a good look either
Quite the contrary: at worst news reports from other countries often miss out on important nuances of local culture, or even is influenced by prejudice against them, or in the best case, get a clearer and less biased outside view on things by not being influenced by nationalism or emotions
Either way, it doesn't really present a prettier picture
I find it a bit weird to say that because we are more often confronted with a UK point of view we have more anti-UK bias
A much more simple explanation is that the nationalistic reasons for Brexit don't work on us and that therefore it's only logical that we are no big fans of Brexit (never mind all the antagonistic rhethoric against us and us getting poorer too)
I'm not taking any sides, I'm just saying that it makes sense from both viewpoints and that you can save your grievances about anti-UK bias because of language specifically, if anything this grants you a disproportionally big cultural and political sphere of influence
Still better than paying 100´s of euros payage
When driving on the E17 the ones in the middle lane going 100 are usually 30 year old Peugots with an F on the back
Nice troll
For Dutch:
In general (but lots of exceptions exist, and families have moved between countries in the past): the Netherlands will not capitalize 'de' or 'van', but Belgium will use 'De' and 'Van'.
There were also some funny guys who chose dumb names like Pannekoek (pancake)
Not that funny now hey
FYI
Van België is used as their surname sometimes, but their actual surname is van Saksen-Coburg en Gotha
My favorite dutch last name is "pissman"(pee man)
Costumer of ours
It's a pretty easy language overall and quite closely related to my own (Dutch) so it could have been worse I guess
Yeah, I think I do
More so the cultural dominance of the US than the language itself though
And it is a bit disheartening that for communication with my countrymen to be effective a foreign language seems to be the best option by far
No, I’m quite happy that there is a language most people speak that is not so hard to learn
Only in the sense that a lot of our culture is being anglicized
I think it's great that there is a lingua franca, but it does get kind of annoying when people's start mixing English and Dutch (or even worse, French) in their daily language
It feels like the Lingua Franca of the world sometimes and I think that’s a great thing
Especially as someone who’s from Belgium, where we have three different language communities struggling to understand eachother
Not really i do wish there was more stuff in other languages that could help me learn them i also don't like how americans in particular do not understand things that are not common in their country like the metric system or minor cultural things
Luxembourg:if they rise the fuel price
The netherlands:their accent hurt a lot
France: their national football team
Germany:no
I think we ourselves are the biggest threat to our own country
Can you explain
Oh shit you know about it, i mean we would never do something like this
Hockey is a brutal game
Your could be afraid from your financial situation
And we would keep it like this(in real life the north and south are best friends but we act like we don't like each other so the neighbours don't come suspicious)
Maybe they give  us obesity with bratwurst and liquorice
So that means war
You guys love our accent though
Most Dutch people I've spoken to think our accent is cute
Nah that record got broken by northern ireland
You also work very close with the belgians right
Do they sometimes jam your radars
That is becaus we are dedicated to our act(where is the oscar)
And who are you
You do it also with canada and mexico
And you half of our tax money
Ögedei's mongol invasion went as deep as Czechia, Austria, and Croatia so they didn't really care too much about having to cross some mountains to fuck someone's day up
Commonwealth time
Interesting ,but what i never understood is why, russia is big enough an europe is not gonna attack russia for more land
That's funny because it's true
If we get it from carice van houten
The russians even touching belgian airspace
Yeah delete the comment about the mexicans so our russian friend can make the joke
[Well, their aircraft did
Their pilot did not
An attack on norway is it difficult,a conflict between norway and russia is it financialy a big cost for russia(becaus i read an attack on ukrain will cost a lot of money)
Yep, knowing he lived quite rural
What are the odds
We have a small German community also dialects are dying here
I speak a tiny bit of walloon thanks to my grandparents
Over here all 3 regional languages are official ones so German doesn't really count I think
I speak a West Flemish dialect though and the other regions joke/act like it might as well be a separate language
I speak Dutch, the ‘majority’ language in Belgium, but I prefer speaking West-Flemish
Which can be considered to be a language on it’s own as it’s a strange combination of Flemish and French
Around 1 million people speak it in Flanders, 80
000 in France and 30
000 in The Netherlands
Isnt it because of some French policy that tries to get French to be the main/only language spoken, for some sort of closer feel of unity
The Flemish minority around Dunkirk is also getting smaller and smaller
Not really i think, the difference is just the accent and some words, a bit like the difference between the French in Paris and in the south of france or with the French in Belgium or Switzerland
I think wallon is dying its a sort of mixture between French German and flemish
You have something of 600k speakers and it will probably die in the 21th century
Here in flanders all of them in school we are forced to learn "algemeen nederlands" (common dutch) currently only the elderly still speak it
There are still 25% of the population who speak French in Canada
Thats just like, the entire West
Living in a country where history and a lot of scientific fields don't get studied because they're not profitable for the debt they cause doesn't sound attractive honestly
Many people from western europe still know little of their eastern european brothers and sisters
U've got Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya
Deserts with camels, going to own the sun energy market
Most I'd know would be Egyptian history because of movies and series, but I barely know anything about North African culture
Edit: missed Algeria, biggest country there lol
Do you consider countries like Nigeria North or Central Africa
I have a great deal of respect for Maghreb nations and feel a lot of kinship towards them
To me they feel as close as several fellow EU countries
I don't believe I have that much knowledge over them though
Not to say I'm without a clue either
The high days of the Bourgundy counts in their rule of the lower countries (14th, 15th century)
John the Bold; John the Fearless etc
A local historian did a popular podcast on his book about the Bourgundians and it has fascinated me ever since
1) Lots of political manoeuvring to get a first kind of unification in the areas of the low countries
Going against France one day, against England the other, and even contending with the Holy Roman Emperor and meanwhile frequent rebellions in Flanders itself (Ghent like 5 times over their rule)
2) Betrayal: at one point John the Fearless was betrayed by the French king and slaughtered on a bridge
3) They had lavish lifestyles and parties (hence the term Bourgundian lifestyle), which would be amazing to see in life
4) Lots of the cities still have a lot of the landmarks
5) Several strong female players, like Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut and Margaret III, Countess of Flanders
The First World War I know it’s very hard to make an AC game in a World War but there are so many historic events that happened then in our country and many of the old cities like Ghent look exactly the same now like in that time with many old buildings and they are some of the most beautiful cities in the world
Four options: -Roman times (to get Ambiorix some fame)
\-Burgundian times
\-Under the Spanish
\-Belgian revolution
The ancient Rome one seems very plausible after the last three games
WW2 AC isn't really compatible with the RPG turn AC has taken
But adding in a tonne of Roman gear, political intrigue (Templar emperors
), aggressive expansion, barbarian invasions, a vast and varied territory, gladiator fights
In fact I bet it's the next AC setting, or at least on the shortlist
Yessss
It would be awesome to see Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp, Louvain and more in an AC game
Curious though, what book/podcast are you referring to
Sounds interesting
De Bourgondiërs, Bart Van Loo
[Link to book]
You can find it on Spotify as a free podcast
It's probably the most well known English language Christmas movie
However, in the French-speaking part of the country, we tend to be more in line with France when it comes to movies
Therefore, the traditional Christmas movies would be "[Le père Noël est une ordure] or "[Les Bronzés font du ski]
Yes, every year

Margies (marginalen) in the North c:
We need to have someone from the German part to tell us about their terms
Probably Assi like the Germans xD
I'll be the stand in German c:
I speak French and Spanish
I can somewhat understand Portugese and Italian if it is written, I may not get things like idoms but I probably could understand the general meaning of the message
Understanding someone speaking either of these languages is a whole different story, though
It is disturbing because my brain would be like "Wtf is happening, it sounds familiar, I should be able to understand".
As for Romanian, I may be able to recognize some words but understanding the general meaning of the message may be more difficult than for Portugese and Italian
Very good
My grandma always goes on trips to Germany And it’s always fun to see her and the hotel owner talk in their own language (Dutch vs German) yet being able to have a perfect conversation
Dutch/Flemish native, can understand a decent amount of German but probably not as well without the exposure to it
Lot more similar than with Scandinavian languages though, the writings appear more alien in that regard
Although I’ve caught myself confused a few times when I heard a Scandinavian language spoken in my city and couldnt decipher if it were Flemish or something else for a few seconds
Swedish and NO, DK have a lot of words that are easy to remember because they are oddly similar sometimes
Icelandic is the one that seems the farthest removed, there is a word here and there that makes sense but other than that it’s more unique
Language families are pretty fun
Imo, German sounds a bit like Dutch from the middle ages in some ways, like a lesser evolved language
Show me your hands, I'll show you
We used the guillotine back in the days

Pretty common in Brussels and ''communes à facilités'' (communes on or near the bilingual border) but very rare elsewhere I think
In Flanders(Belgium, education is not a federal thing here) we learn french when we are 10-11 or so but sometimes even earlier
We learn english at age ~14
The kids who are better at school and in higher streams learn german at age 16 and the higherst stream learns Latin from age 13 i think, with a possebility of greek
Wallonia is different, they also learn a secondairy language, but they have to choose between english and dutch
which is a shame because they allways choose english
So the walloons cannot speack dutch most of the time
And when kn flanders they will NOT try speacking dutch, nor english they just assume we all know our french very well, which is very frustrating
That’s why the bilingual Brussels is more and more becoming “francophonic”(no idea if that’s a word)
In Uni we had a lot of English courses
I am now going for my second masters and it’s entirely in English
I think you can count bi/multilingual schools on one hand, however it is common at university level to have classes in English aswell
Pretty common
We learn Dutch, French, English and in later years German as well
Most school have at least Dutch, French and English as second language and in my school you had to take a second language (English, German or Dutch, from most chosen to least) then when you went in 5ft or 6th year you could take a third language (English, Dutch, German or Spanish, again from most chosen to least)
You also had the option of having immersion, where some subject would be taught in a different language, when i was in secondary it was English only in my school but another one from my town offered German immersion
At highschool only the language's classes were in that language (French; English; German)
Other classes were all in Dutch
In uni we had some semesters with English classes though
Well, it does exist
It is called 'Content and Language Integrated Learning".
My daughter has had biology, geography and informatics in English in a Flemish public secondary school
Catalonia, Basque, Galicia
The thing is, if Vlaams Belang and NVA win big next Flemish elections, they could try to split even if the majority of people disagree
The Independent Republic of California begs to differ
That'd be unconstitutional though, and doing something unconstitutional while a majority of the people disagree will fuck up lots
velocity and speed, which makes physics confusing
What the
Wegen = verb or plural
Singular for road is "weg".
Don't forget Flanders
I think that, at least for Dutch-speakers, it's pretty easy compared to others because the languages are very closely related
also:
> I’ve heard that over 90% of people in the Netherlands and over 85% of  people in Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark) can speak English
For the Netherlands at least it's not true
This was a test where Dutch people had to say of THEMSELF if they spoke good English, and in the same test like 80% said that they speak better English than the mayority of Dutch people
As for Dutch, I don't think school has anything to do with it
In Dutch Belgium the numbers are similar to the Netherlands, while in French Belgium they actually spend way more time studying English yet proficiency is remarkably lower
Furthermore, plenty of kids who haven't had a single class of English yet speak very simple English
I believe the following to be responsible:
- Dutch and English are extremely similar
English is one of the easiest languages to learn for Dutch speakers, and vice versa
- A lot of popular media is English, giving people a lot of exposure to the language
Children aquire languages especially well, and combined with an easy language and a lot of exposure, this could easily explain high English proficiency amongst Dutch speakers
For Flanders, Belgium:
- Small country, and Flemish alone doesn't get you very far
- Lots of influence of anglo culture
- We get English from 2nd year of secundary school
- No dubbing
- Lots of travelling, and people don't speak French or Dutch, English is you safest bet
Province (West-Flanders) , Flanders, European
Only Belgian when national team is playing
I identify first as Flemish
Then being from Antwerp (Antwerpenaar)
Then European
Then Belgian (although it only lives when the national football team is playing)
The dynamic between North and South is pretty different tho, you’ll find a lot more Belgians in Wallonia than in Flanders
I identify with my city first, then Flemish, then Belgian and then European
Watching tv and playing football
If my parents allowed me I was playing football outside, if not I was watching tv
That’s basically my youth
Shadow boxing but with a stick
I kicked a lot of imaginary ass back in my day
Literature sounds very strange
Littruh chur
I had to overcome some kind of mental block to say that word
"Rural" is also a terrible word
I can't pronounce "microtransactions" quickly
I have to distinctly split it in parts
For example: "Fuck this game and it's shitty micro - trans - actions"
However, I don't understand how some people can't pronounce "nuclear" and make it "nucular"
I've always hated the word champion, and championship
I remember being in second grade and just not being able to pronounce it
A classmate even laughed at me for that
Maybe that's why I still feel like I can't pronounce it
I can't think of a single word, I study in English, but "lord of the rings" just always comes out as "lororerings" :/
Rural is a terrible word
I just pronounce it "litrally"
Native English-speaker; I once made some Polish friends of mine repeat "Fred's threats fret threads". They made me talk about that bee in Szebśćenie or however it's spelt
Most Dutchmen pronounce dead, dad and that like the word debt
The English word "and" is usually pronounced without the D and the vowel is like uh
So it is pronounced like Dutch "een". Even the dictionary mentions this pronunciation
Good contender for hardest to spell
Quite funny, were talking about language and you're making a spelling mistake
It's vice versa :)
Why is it that when Dutch and German borrow words from French, they sound similar to French, whereas when English borrows a French word, the pronunciation gets put through a shredder
No problem
But please do not assume Belgians speak French :)
I've been in Cardiff for a night out
There was a culture shock
At 20h people were already shitfaced
At that hour, typical students in Belgium meet up to eat something ("fondke leggen")
It was as if everyone had to go home at midnight and thus had to binge as quickly as possible
Really weird
They are not really far, but no direct neighbors: Ireland and Austria
Both formerly very catholic with a bigger (and in Belgium's case two) condescending neighbor who speaks the same language
When Austrians complain about Germans, I totally get the feeling
And when I read stories about the crimes of the catholic church in Ireland, it makes me think how influential the church was over here
Also the gloomy weather
Swin, nature reserve
Basically on the border of Belgium and the Netherlands there is an area that's rather flat and during the flood gets flooded before going all the way back
It's a huge area with a huge amount of birds and such
Alternative, the "polders", again between Belgium and the Netherlands
A lot of small lakes, we went there on occasion to find eggs, swim, etc
Anything going South for me is the Flemish diamond
High density of people and industry so basically jack shit there
Not OP, but this is in Belgium, more specifically in the most eastward Flemish province, Limburg
On the same domain there's also a very cool open air museum, with old preserved buildings from all over Flanders, as well as a forest, an arboretum and really nice castle gardens
Certainly worth a visit if you ever come to Belgium
We use Blackboard Collaborate Ultra at university
Zoom is banned
What do you dislike about blackboard collaborate
My university uses BB collaborate ultra for every faculty (I think) and the professors at my faculty really like using it
I also like it, but I haven't used Zoom so I can't compare
In Belgium:
Reet = ass
Lulstraat = dick street
We have a place called 'the anal triangle' because there are 3 cities/towns with 'ass' in it:
Reet, which just means ass
Kontich, with kont meaning ass
Aartselaar, but you pronounce it as Aarselaar and aars also means ass
There are also Aarsele and Aarshot
We also have Bierbeek which means beer stream
We also have towns like Peer (pear) and Wortel (carrot)
And we have many more
In Belgium there is Buitenland
Meaning abroad in English
In Belgium, Trou-de-mon-cul (hole of my ass l, literally)
Also Cul d'Enfer (hell ass)
Historically, le Cul was the back of a field (or a small field)
Poepershoek would be "fucking corner" (fucking as in sex) for us Belgians
Also, Nottingham was called Snotingham, during the Anglo-Saxon period
I don't think that's Europe my good sir
Where is Lulstraat
Asking for a friend
there are many funny names of towns in France [see this map]
There are also Putte ( whore in french),Jambes (Legs), a bus stop "Couillet-Queue" ( "balls and dick"),Champion,Bouge(Move),the river la Haine (Hate),Bouillon(Broth),etc
In Mechelen you have the Befferstraat
I don't know anymore, it was a very tiny street without houses in Flanders
Do you mean in Bonheiden
On the Mechelsesteenweg
No the Befferstraat in Mechelen
It leads to the grote Markt
The one you are talking about is Befferhof and Befferdreef which are in Bonheiden right on the border with Mechelen though
Yeah, your right
Railway disaster in Buizingen would be on the list
The first one to spring to mind (perhaps due to it's relative recency) is the [Buizingen train crash] in 2010
Two fully loaded commuter trains entered in a head on collision in Brussels after one of the drivers had ignored a red light
The worst one however is probably the Marcinelle disaster, which happened in a coal mine called "Bois du Cazier" in Marcinelle, now part of UNESCO World Heritage
In 1956 an Italian mine worker tried to load a cart into one of the lift cages
What he didn't know was that that lift was actually headed towards another level
So while he was loading his cart into the cage, the lift moved upwards
This caused the telephone lines and two electrical cables to break of as well as the air and oil pipes of the lift
This then of course sparked an immense fire underground whose deadly gasses rapidly spread throughout the entire mine through it's ventilation system
The heat of the fire snapped the cables of the other lifts and soon the miners found themselves trapped with no means of escape or communication between the above and below
Of the 275 miners at work that day only 13 ever made it out alive
When the excavators finally reached the bottom of the mine well over a week later, they famously reported "Tutti cadaveri".
Armenian Genocide
In the Heysel-Stadium 1985 39 people were killed because the stands collapsed
It's been the Champions League Final between Liverpool and Juventus
After that, the stadium was renamed and renewed
Not geographically in Germany but by a German with a German company: [deliberate crash of a Germanwings airplane] into the Alps, resulting in 150 fatalities
Or the bus with all the schoolkids that crashed in Switzerland - if found that it wasn’t suicide
People were killed because of confrontations between violent supporters
The collapsing stands are a consequence of the confrontation (English hooligans charging Italian stands)
The collapse isn't even the cause of most deaths
From your link:
> Contrary to reports at the time, and what is still assumed by many, the collapse of the wall did not cause the 39 deaths
Instead, the collapse relieved pressure and allowed fans to escape
Most died of suffocation after tripping or being crushed against the wall before the collapse

Usually one really knows anything about Belgium, except for that one Japanese man who, upon hearing where my friends and I had come from, said, "Oh, Congo
... I mean, really
Well either they don’t know the country or make a reference to WW 2
The worst one was when an American said to me: “that’s not even a country, stop making up places”. So that was kind of sad
When it comes up in a converstation with non-europeans, most often I get comments on Waffles
Which is weird to me, because waffles are not in the top 5 things I feel like people should associate with us
(I'd say Chocolate; Beer; Fries; Dysfunctional governments; Surrealism/absurdism)
The craziest part is that within the waffle people there's even two factions: you have the group (usually from non-anglo countries) who've had actual Belgian style waffles (Liège or Brussels style waffles); and you have the group who associate us with American "Belgian" waffles (usually from anglo-countries), which are definitely not Belgian
Yeah, either they know nothing and ask where it is or they'll name some cities like Anderlecht and Clubbrugge
Also EDEN HAZARD AND LUKAKU
But to be fair most know about Brussels and have a strong opinion on whether it is livable or not
It's either a cool place or hellhole overrun with Muslims
When I used to live in Molenbeek they would usually ask how dangerous it is, if I see many terrorists etc
Not yet, but there's still a chance it comes in February or March
No nothing
This week the temperature was stayed between -3°C - 3°C however but it didn't snow
No there is no snow in Belgium so far the last few years there was only snow at the end of the winter
It was semi popular in the past but now it has been replaced by online shopping
[The police officer pepperspraying protestors while eating a waffle]
[Walen go home] during the linguistic protests at the (then bilingual) Catholic University of Leuven in 1968
These protests did not only cause the university to split amongst linguistic lines but also set in motion the split of the Christian People's Party and led to the state reform of 1970, the first of many that would shape the federal structure of Belgium
[The construction of the Atomium] (1957)
As a fellow Belgian, I can confirm
I also like the foto of Queen Fabiola with an apple
Why would he lock his bike at the king's palace
This surely would be the last place his bike would get stolen
Some people don't age well
That could be from the Dutch hunger winter during WW2
Advantage: traveling and its really quit
TIL nearly 20% of people in Luxembourg are Portuguese

I wonder if you can go freely to the North part of the island and if it's a often recurrence to do so
Or the island is well separated and the two parts are hermetic to each other
Tbf, they could absolutely give an interesting answer tonthis question
Which would make their inhabitants only rarer, thus making it infinitely interesting
Faroese (sounds even nicer than Icelandic in my opinion) and eastern Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian)
Italian people talking about food, especially in documentaries like when they make olive oil and all
So melodic and passionate
Definetly Japanese
That double L is something else entirely though
I love how rare it is because I've never heard it in any other language
That's actually such a good description
I love the way it sounds though
I find it really nice sounding, can't really explain
It feels very "aerial" due to its pronounciation (while Icelandic feels more "breathy" in comparison)
Our first king, [Léopold I] was German
Otherwise, for prime ministers, [Charles Rogier] (one of our main revolutionaries) was from France
Not that I know of
The closest we got to that was Elio Di Rupo as prime minister
Son of Italian immigrants but the only one born in Belgium
He is also openly gay, and that got pretty much no attention
(Just like we currently have a trans woman minister without it being made a very big deal)
Belgium (Southern Netherlands) has had as sovereign: French (Burgundian) Dukes, (certain parts) French Kings, Spanish Kings, Austrian Archdukes and Emperors, a combo of an Austrian and Spanish Archduke and Archduchess, a French Emperor, a Dutch king, all before we settled with a German Prince who became King Leopold I of Belgium
Also: Prince-Bishopric of Liege has had multiple foreign Prince-Bishops
Since Belgium it’s been mostly cool, have been some French-born ministers but that’s about it
One of our ex prime ministers was born from Italian immigrants, Elio Di Rupo
Does it count
>one of our main revolutionaries
>from France
Well that explains why he was a revolutionary
Charles V was born in Belgium (and yes, we can use this name, all the Low Countries were called Belgica in Latin still during that time)
Léopold 1 was German, our first king
Charles Rogier, one of our first prime minister and major member of our revolution, was French
I totally forgot we had that trans woman as minister
Was a rather big deal internationally
Don't forget when we temporarily made a United Belgian States through revolution, before the French revolution even happened
The real copy cats are the French
Yeah, but that's not really fair is it
Belgium didn't exist prior to that
Exactly, nobody in Belgium cares and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way
What is more accepting than not giving a shit about the sexuality and/or gender of your politicians
We don't care if she is trans or Elio is gay
We only care if they do their jobs, or more accurately, if they don't.
Was it before the French Revolution
Both started in 1789
One of my law professors (and ex-minister) thought Cyprus was Malta and Kreta was Cyprus, and said that a few times in front of a lecture hall of +600 students until someone corrected him
It was funny though, and he could laugh with it
It sure did the stereotype that older people can’t do European geography not good
In classic architecture class we were talking about a house in the Netherlands and one student remarked how it's obvious where the house was build, because the outside was colored in red-white-blue, to which our teacher remarked 'Since when is there red in the Dutch flag
The Germans started ww1- my dutch and religion teacher
She also said the winter olympcs of 2018 i think it was where held in North Korea
Religion teacher, who nobody really took serious and had to fight constantly for control of the class
She used these fill-in booklets to structure here courses in different themes
One of which was about the role of science and religion
Basically, the point was religion operates on ethics, science operates on factual statements or something like that
But one small sentence in the booklet was in my mind a bit out of place
So I was one of the few paying attention to see how the teacher would clarify it
So she read the sentence: " Just like religion, scientists often use **symbolism**", and just moves on to the next part
So I raise my hand and asked if she could give an example
She became red, began to stammer a bit
The whole class was silently waiting for her giving an example
She eventually came up with " a sunset, the sun isn't really setting
" but nobody was convinced
She then apologized to me for not immediately finding anothe example and moved on with the course
I felt a bit bad
Edit: symbolism, not metaphors
So he was what ?
Vandelanotte
To be fair the aquaduct one had me in doubt for a second becuase technically he's not wrong
So many people don’t get this and it annoys me
There was a map
We were learning about the European Union and he included a map of Europe several times in his PowerPoint to show the expansion of the EU and other stuff
Yes
She wasn't my youngest teacher ever but she didn't seem THAT old
I think we all remember how the United Kingdom of the Netherlands worked out (or maybe not all of us)
To be fair it wasn't the brightest class
Some propably didn't even know what the Dutch flag looks like, some others like myself were trying to suppress our laugh
They still hear language
People who are deaf, however, maybe think in sign language, written language and moving lips
What about deaf and blind
Touch
Either way, animals indeed don't think in full sentences
But they probably have other ways to structure their thought, like images and feelings
That's true, she did however asked for the country and not a city
She is known to mix up stuff, nobody corrected her because it was  for some trivial pursuit style 2018 recap and the guys who got the point didn't win anyway
Italy sure did help the allies by trying to invade Greece
Retarded politician teaching law
There could only be the one lol
I know that her statement was wrong and she suggested it had another function than it  actually has
I just remarked that an aquaduct CAN sometimes span a river
Still not it's primary function though
In English you spell it as aqueduct
That just makes so little sense that I assumed the op misspelled it
In Dutch
And I assume there are other languages as well
It's a regional thing
Some towns have a strong Saint-Martin's day  (11 November) tradition, in others the kids go around with New Year
The door to door singing is still a thing if it wasn't for kovit
The gateau is big money, supermarkets and backers sell tons of them
That we may have winter blackouts again, due to our underfunded outdated overexpensive energysector
We have whole schedules detailing which provinces will get cut off from electricity at what times
In Belgium we had the news of a guy in his mid twenties that wanted to honour his deceased mother by litting fireworks
He accidentally lit his face up with the fireworks and passed away as well
Winter
In this time of the year
Unheard of
There is a poem by the flemish author Willem Elsschot called ‘Het Huwelijk’ (The Marriage)
It’s about an old man who is contemplating his life and his marriage
His wife is old and sickly and he fantasises about killing her and burning down the house, but he doesn’t act it out
That’s where these lines come in:
“Maar doodslaan deed hij niet, want tussen droom en daad
staan wetten in de weg en praktische bezwaren,
en ook weemoedigheid, die niemand kan verklaren,
en die des avonds komt, wanneer men slapen gaat
(My literal translation) “But he did not kill her, for in between a dream and a deed, there are laws that stand in the way, and practical issues, and a melancholy mood that no one can explain, that comes at night when we go to sleep”
The whole poem is a masterpiece of sparse but powerful imagery
The ending gives me goosebumps every time
Although I know some french speaking Belgian poets, I don't think a line of poetry from them really reached such status
However lines from French poets such as "Demain dès l'aube, à l'heure où blanchit la campagne" are better known
I don't know much about Flemish poets though, maybe someone from the Flemish region can elaborate on that ?
Most definitely a good choice
Most certainly one of the most beautiful in the (Dutch/) Flemish language
However
Most people would not have heard about this poem, as it is not widely known
Ask someone to recite a poem in dutch, and it is very well possible they well resort to Hieronymus van Alphen's "Jantje zag eens pruimen hangen" :
> Jantje zag eens pruimen hangen,
>o! als eieren zo groot
>'t Scheen, dat Jantje wou gaan plukken,
>schoon zijn vader 't hem verbood
(Little John saw prunes hanging from a tree, prunes as big as eggs
He wanted to take some, but his father told him not too
At least that is better than the (only) line of poetry this guy I know can recite in Dutch
>Vinde gaai maain gat nie te dik in deze rok
(do you think my a\*\* looks fat in this skirt
I can't really think of many foreign movies set in Belgium
The only one I can think of is 'In Bruges' which shows Bruges as a picturesque, touristy, historical city with shitty weather
So pretty accurate
The movie shows only one side of Brugge, the touristy side
The whole of Belgium is much more than a medieval city
Agreed
It was the centre of world trade for a while and they do brew "Straffe Hendrik" in Brugge, but there is more in Belgium
Much like Britain is much more than Buckingham Palace
France is much more than Champs Elysées
Spain much more than Ramblas
Say you prefer Dutch beer
Drink beer in another beers glass
Be careful with our beers
Some are quite heavy and will get you drunk in no time
Think that Flemish people and Walloons are the same
Its kind of the same like England and Scotland
We are two different types of people with our own culture
Put beer in the wrong glass, i'll make an exeption for pills but never put duvel in a crystal glass
Speaking French in Flanders ir Dutch in Wallonia
I would also add don't try to keep up the drinking with the locals
It depends where you are from, but its quite common to see Brits and other tourists lying passed out by 22h or puking in the gutters
Our beer has a bit more alcohol than in some other places
And don’t say fries are invented in France
Except for us
You'll always stay Hollanders for Belgians :-)
I didn’t know it was such a rude thing to ring your bell in the Netherlands
Here in Belgium I guess we’re somewhere in between on this
I’ve always learned to ring your bell when someone’s cycling in the middle of the cycling path so you can safely overtake them
However lately, more and more people seem to think you’re being rude
You can just feel them looking annoyed once you’ve overtaken them
Kinda depends on what you buy
We bought our kitchen there because many people we knew were extremely glad with theirs
Also, their customer service and warranty are a lot better than the alternatives
Food, cheap and a maze to walk trough
Good for people with a low budget like students and young couples, not so good in the long run
They have some innovative ideas that are now done by others aswell
(Powerless chargers and usb power outlets integrated into furniture, smart lamps etc
Over here I've seen it used by my sister when she went to study as well as my parents who make 300k'ish/year
Shoe cabinet, a fifth wardrobe(or something, not counting them), etc
I'm moving out somewhere next year and I'll be buying most of my stuff there because I'm cheap and with few exceptions don't care that much about quality
As long as my desk, chair and bed are higher quality the rest can be bottom of the barrel
I find it more disgusting how many Germans brag about them being good at war
Your such a chad good job
Both China and the US are in essence oligarchies though
More like American personel not taking responcibility for their criminal actions
Fries from a traditional ´frietkot´. Most fries outside of Belgium taste like paper
Forgetting about Belgian cheese, tsk tsk tsk
Chimay, Oude Brugge, Orval, Maredsous, Herve, Briquette de chèvre, te veel om op te noemen
Most Dutch chocolate is a joke though, with some notable exceptions
Mexican, no
I've also seen an Irish restaurant
Obviously the ones you mentioned are among the biggest of course
We use that as well
Can confirm
We use it in Dutch too
There is no real relation found between drinking hard water and kidney stones (thus far)
The only polish ''groceries'' that i know of where i live are in cheap stores (no offense) like in Traffic or Action and it's Fanta or Coca cola that comes from Poland, idk why though
Icelandic history
I find it crazy that they were their own country *before* they became part of Norway
Not a country but a specific region: Bourgogne
Ever since I visited the region and listened to this amazing podcast about it’s history (for all Dutch speaking people: De Bourgondiërs van Klara, te vinden op alle podcast kanalen) and read a book about it (De Bourgondiers of Bart Van Loo, recently translated in German) I’ve been absolutely fascinated by the region and its past
Russia and France
I don't know why, but they both have such a rich  history that has known some extremes
I just like Russia's architecture and such too
See you all in 400 years when sombody mentions us
Malta
For such a small blob on this globe, it has a fascinating series of events during its history
For me personally, it's because it's so rich
You guys have been through so fucking much
It's close to us Europeans, but also totally different
It's hard to describe
Added bonus: I love Russian architecture so there's that
I think a week in Ghent during the week of November 16th, 1949 could be interesting: [Battle of Gravensteen]
To 1830 when the Belgian Revolution happened and I want to see if my home city supported it or not
-All the way back to before the Indo-Europeans arrived
-Back to 2000 years ago when there were just Germanic and Celtic tribes
I would like to see what their life is like
I recognize the German one, the Russian one, the French one and the British one
I may know a few of the first words, but that's about it
Well, ever since our prime minister accidentally sang the first two phrases to the French national anthem I always sing that when they ask me to sing the Belgian one
I think most Belgians don’t even know the Belgian one
I know the French one (La Marseillaise)
I can sing along to the chorus and a big part of the first verse
Despite being a Dutch speaking (Flemish) Belgian, I can't even remember what the Dutch national anthem (het Wilhelmus) sounds like
I just listened to it, and I'm sorry to say this, but I understand why I don't even remember it
It's a bit boring, it reminds me of those slow church songs
I also don't like the lyrics
I can sing along to the 'chorus' of the English/British national anthem 'God Save the Queen'.
I would recognize the beginning of the German national anthem 'Das Deutschlandlied'. But then again it starts with 'Deutschland, Deutschland, über alles
' (Germany, Germany above all
) So that would be difficult not to recognize
I didn't know the national anthem of Luxembourgh
I just went to listen to it and I think it's a pretty great anthem, sounds nice, great lyrics
Well done Luxembourgh
&#x200B;
As I barely know the ones from my neighboring countries, I doubt I'd not the ones from further away in Europe
Btw, I'm not a sports fan so I generally don't come across many nationale anthems
Funnily enough they don't. Sure you see the expensive cars (but most of them are company cars)
As housing is concerned I have concluded the following
They either live in a "normal standalone" house or they live in a forest
Meaning that their mansions are surrounded by tree's so nobody sees them from the street
So you think it is just a private forest with a gate
You have the occasional snob who shows off
Those are usually ignored
Buying big houses
Especially in summer when all the summerbars are open they love to spend money on expensive drinks/bottles so that everyone start looking at them
Almost got into a fight with such an asshole because we needed to move from his table while we were there first
I don’t care who you are if you don’t have any seating do like the rest of us and wait at the bar or go somewhere else
I don’t give them much attention as it is mostly ‘fils a papa’s’ spending their parents money
Nevertheless i refuse to go to summerbars again, now we meet up and go sit near De Schelde with our own booze and food that everybody brought a long to share
More fun, less drama and way more cheaper than being in a bar only to be seen
Well it is trashy
Just guessing it would be "familie" (family) just another everyday soap but it has been going for decades
Atm 30 seasons at 6823 episodes
Isnt ' thuis 'older then family
It's familie
I was also expecting thuis
West vlaams (coastal area and Brugge in Belgium), they talk like they swallowed their tongue
If a West Vlaming is interviewed on national television, they are always subtitled .
I just know West-Flanders is going to be mentioned
West Flanders represeeeent
It did get mentioned
You even have Wikipedia in western Flemish for the fact
I just knew that this was gonna get mentioned on this post
And as someone from West-Flanders I also don't always understand
Young people are no problem but when I hear some old people talking it really feels like a different language
By what definitions
I’m pretty proud of my West Flemish but I would not call it a different language
Really cool
It's unfortunate that all the recordings from the US (at least the 5-6 i tried) have such bad quality sound, i can barely make it out
Some dialects you really can't call dutch anymore lol, can't make out anything being said in the Vaals recording for instance
Sounds more German than Dutch
Well, Zeeuws is a 'overgangsdialect' between the Flemish and Hollandic dialects
i was very confused at first when i clicked on the first wikipedia result for "Karel Cogge", unreadable lol
Last year was the first year I didn't get to see snow at all :( I'm a bit anxious that when I have kids, that they won't ever see snow here in Belgium
Have you been sleeping under a rock
Software engineers with tattoos and piercings are super common
I AM one
Comma for decimals, spaces for thousands :
10 569 745,369
I use spaces as a decimal separator and because my elementary school teachers couldn't see the difrence between a point and a comma
So I write 1 000 000,00€.
Yep same with your rebelious southern neighbours
Might be my gaming background but I've used things like "I have xK in the bank".
I've been using that in international conversations to avoid confusion
Can confirm
And if you are working in a scientific field you usually won't use ',' but '.' As decimal seperator
Here in Belgium at least it's either €1,55 or 1,55 EUR
Thanks Napoleon
Usually it's expected that people's religion (or lack of it) is something more or less private
Being an atheist is fine, but it's not something you're supposed to preach about
That means you're the vast majority in this country
I can confirm because I don't know her name
Thanks for mentioning, I honestly didn't know
I don't follow the news and have no interest in politics
So I just assumed that as we don't have a federal government we also didn't have a PM or that Charles Michel was still in place until a federal government was made
Just stop making new ones
It works wonders
Yeah and her name is Sophie Wilmès.
But nobody care
Oh yeah, 15 year old student fucking his 40 something old teacher is so french
We literally had a test about 2019 last week on school and one of the questions was who our prime minister is
I think more than half of the students in my class didn't know the answer
Funny thing is I had completely forgotten about her
We don't really give a shit here any more because it's such a fucking mockery
17 just like me
I know
We even learned her name
Some people wrote Bart De Wever, wtf
Everyone knows he is the Emperor of Flanders
Both in my own language as while im talking in English,  I use 's' instead of 'sh'
buddah-pest; so the s sound
Though people I know who have visited tend to obnoxiously insist on the "sh" sound
There is no sh sound in Dutch except in loanwords and in diminutives of words ending with s. (s + je becomes "shuh")
So we say Boedapest with an s sound
French (I understand it with lots of effort and am far from fluent) and German so I'd be fluent in all three of our national languages
Spanish because it is spoken by a vast percentage of the world and it would, as far as I've been told, also makes Italian somewhat understandable to me
Edit: Also West-flemish, those peasants are hard to understand without subtitles
Spanish and Russian for sure
The third one I don't know
My French is pretty good but I'm definitely not fluent and it's almost a requirement to speak French for a lot of jobs
On the other hand if I would talk to French people for a couple months and follow French media I'd be fluent
But I'd be more interested in knowing Japanese or (Egyptian) Arabic because they're very hard and I'd like to visite Japan and some Arab countries
English, because mastering it is the true art
French because it's a national language and i'm trash at it and Norwegian because i fell in love with the country last year
Mandarin, Arabic, Swahili
As I already can express myself in Dutch, English, French, German and Spanish, I would be able to communicate with people in a lot of countries in the world in a "local" language
Japanese, Arabic, and Russian
It'd be awesome to be fluent in these three completely different languages, and which aren't as popular as others
I am from Flanders and I can understand your pain
However, the learning curve of French (and many other languages) isn't linear
I had to learn French for 8 years and the progress I made in that last year was HUGE
Learning a language takes time and suddenly your progress will increase exponentially
, so don't give up
>a third one that doesn't make much sense learning just to look cool
Klingon and Elvish bring in all the chicks, I've been told
I don't think many people in the Balkans speak Russian
If I have to believe the other commenters and you it seems like: French is somewhat easy for Italian speakers and Italian is easy for Spanish speakers but not vice versa
As others have said
I'm Flemish and I was indeed taught French
French isn't a class many like though, kinda like Math
All Flemish people eventually learn French up to a different degree, but not every kid is interested or good in languages
Sadly, I was both
I barely passed those classes
As I have a form of dyslexia, languages were never my strong suit, and as a teenager I kinda gave up on it, and focused on science and math
On top of that, I never have to use much French while I often have to use English, so it is extremely rusty and somewhere in the back of my head
Both of them are notorious exceptions and I've never used either of them in my daily life for the last 21 years
If you want to order a beer, you make eye contact with the barman/woman, show a hand with the pinky up, and then a beer will come your way shortly
You are perfectly in your right to refuse a beer you just ordered if they serve it to you in the wrong glass
As soon as the curtains close, all the people who aren't tied to the barman or any of the regulars are expected to leave
When the barman says he'll round up, don't be a dick about it
Now, this I like
Is this only in Belgium
Always thought this was a pretty widespread thing
I've only seen it in Belgium, but I might be wrong off course
Yes it's mainly branding even
Serving it in a glass that's not even a beer glass is just on a whole other level of not done
Are you even drinking a real beer at that point
But if it's some weird wine-like glass but the brand is actually correct, then that's considered to be the brewers fault and not the café's. You'll never really see that on any Belgian (or German) beers though, it's usually foreign brands who come up with these weird non-beer glasses
If you want to be special and unique take a lesson from Kwak or La Corne, those actually have cool glasses
But I'm getting a little off track here
Not serving a beer in it's correct glass is honestly the biggest cultural "no-no" I can think of in Belgium
Not even someone calling fries "French Fries" can match the pain it causes to see someone drink a Duvel from a Chimay glass
Not to long ago there was this guy on r/BELGICA (kind of like the ich\_iel from Belgium) who got permanently banned for posting [this picture] And even on the official r/belgium, right between 'No agenda pushing' and 'Respect \[Serious\] threads' there is the famous 'Rule 5' which states the following: *"Do not advocate serving Belgian beers in beer glasses that weren't specifically designed for those beers
If the beer has no specific glass, the rule can't be violated, but it's probably not worth drinking anyway".*
(EDIT: This might seem like a long-winded answer to such a simple question, in which case my apologies
But you have to understand that I am very passionate about this matter
Yeah no I have no clue either
It was just an assumption really
Yes of course they have it here as well
I'm not trying to criticise foreign brands or anything
The reason I said that is because I've had it a couple times around the Mediterranean, (probably because of the heavy wine culture
But I didn't want it to come over like that, so sorry
I just really dislike drinking from glasses like that
I remember drinking a local beer once which had a glass that was so thin that I broke it while holding it, so maybe it's just some sort of trauma
Idk they just feel a little too uptight for a beer
I like the feeling of a good sturdy glass
But that's just personal opinion
Like I said, I was getting of topic
There are a lot of armed police in Antwerp, they protect the large orthodox Jewish community there
I think it's the second largest orthodox Jewish community in the world outside of Israel, after New York
Same in Belgium
If I'm not mistaken that 5 continent thing is more about continental plates/drift
7 is Celsius
5 is Kelvin
In a sense
Neither is wrong, just depend in what context you're speaking
True
But in some context we also just said Eurazië (Eurasia)
In my school a continent was defined as "one piece of landmass that is completely connected
" It differs from an island only in size: everything bigger than Greenland is a continent
Everything smaller than Greenland and Greenland itself is an island
All this implies that there are 6 continents:
• North-America
• South-America (split from North-America by Panama canal)
• Eurasia (Asia and Europe are a connected piece of land)
• Africa (split from Eurasia by Suez canal)
• Australia (bigger than Greenland, so is a continent)
• Antarctica
There are litterally a 100 different ways to define a continent
That’s more of a historical concept, rather than a geographic one
If we go by tectonic plates we would also have a lot of small ones that are nearly pointless
There are areas that are rather fractured
It's about major landmasses
That's why America and Eurasia are one, and Australia doesn't include the rest of the islands in the neighbourhood
Other way arround
Europe and Asia as a seperate continent is historic while Eurasia is geographic
Til
Thanks
No problem :)
I'll give the reasoning (just because)
There is no geographic reasoning to see Asia and Europe as seperate continents, only culturaly and historicaly you can find reasons for this
It is starting to be really good in the region around Antwerp
Going by bicycle paths it appears that Flanders is similar to the Netherlands while Walloon is the polar opposite
Happy with what we have here in Flanders but I don't think I can speak for all of Belgium
My city, Leuven, is a university city with ~33% of the population during the semester being students
The infrastructure is *okay* but could be better
But there are so many bicycles (~44% of trips are made by bike) that it doesn't really matter all that much
Cars HAVE to pay attention to bicycles because there are so insanely many of them
I think in Flanders in general it is getting better, but there's a reason we recently invented the word 'moordstrookje' (murder strip), meaning a narrow part of a busy road with heavy traffic, which serves as a bike path, and is very dangerous
Like this one:
I still feel unsafe riding my bike in a city I've never been in
Traffic situations are often unclear
I like the fact that "fietsostrades", bicycle highways between towns, are more common
However, speed pedelecs going at 45km/h are a real danger
Brussels is a very car-centered city, but cyclists are increasing, leading to more road rage
Wallonia is an other case, with many hilly parts, I hope a Walloon compatriot can chime in
As a person living in Antwerpen (well, at least in one of its districts), I am very surprised that Antwerpen, for some people, is used as an example of a region where cycling infrastructure is "good".
Yes, there is the "Fietsostrade", which as far as I know, is something other parts of Flanders/Belgium not have
But my knowledge is limited on that topic
And we can be proud it exists
The person that started the project, should get a reward
However
"Fietsostrade" can get very overcrowded during rush hours
Not to mention the many pedestrians using the bike lane for walkies
And then there are the prams &é"'(§è!çà and the e-bikers whizzing past at lightning / breakneck speed
Bike traffic jams at crossings "managed" by traffic lights, which have "elleboogdrukknopjes" that have no effect at all except spread Corona virus and keep cyclers busy
The crossing of the Schelde river
The elevators in the tunnel seem to be like Eden Hazard
More often injured, than playing
Again
Traffic jams during rush hours !
In the city, only the very brave should attempt to ride their bike in streets like Ommeganckstraat, or Brederodestraat, to name just these, or just any street where the bike line and the tramway share the same area
For those unfamiliar with Antwerpen, one is a street next to Antwerp Zoo, the other one is a very busy street with lots of shops in the south of Antwerpen
Parking your bike is also a problem, especially in the center of Antwerpen
Hardly any parking spaces, and a lot of bike theft (of which solving doesn't seem to be a priority for local cops)
Once outside the city limits, often bike lanes are again just painted on the roads and qualify again as  'moordstrookje' (murder strip), the narrow part of a busy road with heavy traffic
Or the bike lane is next to the footpath and is very uneven requiring a custom-build suspension fork to absorb the many potholes
So, if Antwerpen is considered good, then I feel sad (and bad) about the rest of the country
Belgium is "car country". Bikes are not of interest to politicians, as there is hardly any money to be made out of a bike, in comparison to the money made out of cars in taxes on petrol, parking fees
But I agree
It could be worse
I always felt safe cycling on a place like your linked to
And thought it was an OK bicyle road (indication)
Maybe I trust the people in their cars too much who knows lol
First of all, I agree with most of what you said (rushhour is something that is kinda hard to fix in a densly populated area, so I don't think it's fair to complain about that
Or do you want bridges/tunnels at every crossroad
But I specifically said "region arround Antwerp" to not include the district of Antwerp itself as I recognize that this isn't perfect (als a lot harder to fix)
But to be fair, most of Antwerp is "zone 30" so still pretty safe (in theory)
I also said that it is *starting* to get really good, not that it already is really good
In the last 4 years the cycling infrastructure in Antwerp has been improved *a lot*. The fact that I can safely take my bike and drive from Hoboken to De Scheldelaan (Port of Antwerp) while constantly staying on a bicycle track, or to almost every university campus of the UAntwerpen has to account for something
So, considering the infrastructure that has already been build the last few years and that is planned to be build, I think that it is fair to say that Antwerp is starting to be really good for cycling
Wij hebben dus soms zulke fietspaden op wegen waar auto's 70km/u mogen vlammen
Totaal krankzinnig
Maar in vgl met veel andere landen mogen we dan weer niet klagen
They're safer than no bike lane but such a road really requires separated bike lanes
The basic question when designing bike infrastructure shouldn't be:"would I cycle here
" But rather:"would I allow my 10 year old kid to cycle here alone
Quite so
On the whole, Antwerp bikecitizens are well off
However
Compared to Denmark, Holland
not quite there yet
Compared to Portugal
I feel sorry for those people
Denmark is relatively MEH when it comes to bike infrastructure outside of Copenhagen
Or you are a troll or you are just crazy
We have bikes with two sets of gears
And they aren't that expensive
And biking in Lisbon, even with those fantastic gears you're on about, would be hell
Ever been there
It's literally build on 7 hills by the river
In Dutch we have: Wat was was voor was was was
This can have 2 meanings:
1) What was 'was' before 'was' was 'was'? (the answer is 'is')
2) What was 'laundry' before 'laundry' was 'laundry'? (the answer is 'clean clothes)
"klopt als een bus
Translated: "as right as a bus". Used to express when something is just right
And yes, I'm talking about a bus that drives
How
You forgot one meaning: What was wax before it was wax
Actually that isn't completely correct as it's a mix of "het klopt als een zwerende duim
" And "Het sluit als een bus
" So "kloppen" in this context would be literally translated to "throbbing". The bus is not a vehicle either, it's an old word for a box
Which makes it even more ridiculous as the literal translation would be "It throbs like a box".
Het klopt als een zwerende duim = it throbs like a festering thumb
Het sluit als een bus = it closes like a box
Honestly I've never heard of that
I learned something today
Still pretty weird yeah :D
* Father Damian (saint)
* Leopold II (Only king I'm gonna mention since he's the most notorious and had the biggest global impact)
* René Margritte (surrealist painter)
* Hergé (comic book artist)
(I'll try less recent ones from now on, they will predate Belgium, but lived in the area)
* Peter Paul Rubens (painter)
* Pieter Brueghel (the elder) (painter)
* Godfried of Bouillon (king of Jerusalem)
* Gerard Mercator (mapmaker)
* Andreas Vesalius (anatomist)
* Ambiorix (gallic chief)
There's more but if I go on the chances are they are not that well known, or they are mostly famous in one part of the country (Flanders vs Wallonia)
Worth pointing out that Flemish Belgians and Walloon Belgians will not know the same people
Plus since most of the people you mentioned are culturally important but perhaps not historically as important;
* Leopold I
* Leopold II
* Mercator
Thank You for helping out Belgium, but
no thanks
Dutroux
You will not be making many friends with Belgians by calling him an historical figure
And I think you mean "Soeur Sourire". Or not
Why not have both :)
François Who ? Or do you mean Father Damian, the one that cared for the lepers on Molokai ?
I would add Raymond Goethals; Dirk Frimout; Wilmots; Toots Thielemans; pater Damiaan; Rubens '; Breughel,....
Karel Martel grandfather of Charlemaine is also very significant
I wouldn't associate Rubens and Bruegel with the Netherlands since most of their work was done in modern day Belgium (and as a proud Belgian I say they belong to Belgium)
For Bruegel I can agree he's partially dutch, but Rubens was Flemish
Let's hope he's"history" soon
Soeur Sourire made #1 spot in US charts, and I must admit I had never heard of Soeur Emmanuelle
Reading the name "Emmanuelle" made me think of a very different person, certainly not a nun, and not Belgian :)
Indeed :)
r/brandnewsentence
Here in Belgium they are just lying passed out in the streets or puke everywhere
They come here drinking trying to keep up with the locals but our beers have like double the amount of alcohol
The last brit I saw was a few weeks ago in my regular bar i go to
Big attitude, yeah lets drink i'll show you how we do it
He was passed out on the floor at 10h.
> As an active dialect speaker, I actually feel less weird speaking English than standard German, if that makes sense
Same, but for Standars Dutch
I hate it with a passion
"Allons enfants de la patrie" - then Prime Minister Yves Leterme when he was asked on Walloon TV to sing the Belgian national anthem in French
edit: wasn't PM back then, but was about to be
[Link to vid]
Live is no pony camp
Didn't one of your ministers also say something like 'France is a great country, just unfortunate that there are so many French people inside it'?
I mean, Erna Solberg is a fucking riot as well
Examples include:
- Being asked on Twitter to legalise marijuana, replying with "Nah, don't wanna".
- Livestreaming her PUBG games on Twitch
- Livestreaming Bruno Mars concerts on Instagram
I think spaghetti is rather popular in most European countries
[I was mistaking, he was "formateur" and about to be PM] oh and he also answered incorrectly on what they were celebrating on our National day
Tbh I agree with her lol
Isn't she an absolute queen
We see them as cheap(er) workforce that do jobs many Belgians don't want to do anymore (like cleaning)
But on overall I think we don't have any negative thoughts about Romania
You forgot Switzerland and Belgium, who have large parts of their country being Romance speakers
The most famous one is the Grand Place of Brussels ([google street view link] ), and in particular the [town hall]
Most people know about 'Manneke Pis' (The peeing man) in Brussels, but my city Geraardsbergen actually has the real Manneke Pis, or so we claim
[Onze-Lieve-Vrouwenkathedraal (Cathedral of our Lady)] The special thing about is that one of the towers remained unfinished
It's definitely a treasured building in among the citizens
There's even a general rule is that no building in Antwerp may surpass the 123m tall tower, or at least withing 2km of the cathedral
[The Central Station] is good runner up
The inside has a beautifull mix between it's original architecture, and modern expansions
My hometown also has a castle
It's called The Castle of the Dukes of Brabant, [here's a picture] that I took
It's right in the centre of the city and my old high school is right across of it
> The castle of the dukes of Brabant has a long and eventful history
The building probably dates from the early 13th century
For centuries it served as a settlement and a hunting seat
The coat of arms of Maria van Zimmeren, Lady of Turnhout, is displayed above the entrance
A lawcourt has been established in the castle since 1796
In the French era, noble families disappeared from the castle and dilapidation was inevitable
Around 1800 the French government started using the building as a court and as a prison, as deprivation of freedom became the common punishment
In 1807 the castle was sold to the City of Turnhout, which let it to the ministry of Justice
When in 1904 prisoners were moved to the new prison in Wezenstraat, the justice of the peace court moved to the castle
It became property of the province in 1908, which ordered architect Jules Taeymans to restore it
He gave the castle its current exterior appearance
It became property of the state in 1975
The Buildings Agency made a major effort to restore the whole back to its old lustre
Because of this, the Turnhout court is now established in a wonderful historic monument
In the moat you can see the Naiad, the goddess of all springs and rivers
She settled down here in 1991
This is what Rik Poot imagined water nymphs from Greek mythology looked like
These days it's the Court of First Instance of Antwerp (province) division Turnhout
Where I live during the school year we have a famous medieval Cathedral (Sint-Baafs), the Gravensteen Castle, some medieval Abbeys, ...
The list goes on and on, while where I live with my parents, there is only an old neighbourhood from the 1860-1930s and a WW1 hospital, because of the strange environmental circumstances (dunes), but in the next village there’s the ruins of a Medieval abbey, and more landwards there’s a medievak city, with a few churches, 9th century protection wall, 18th century fortress remnants and some other buildings
The region was Belgium’s last stand during WW1
I like the one in Leuven more
One of my favourite cities in our great country
Leuven is nice too, but the question is about one's city, and I'm from Brussels ;)
Marteau in modern French
Martel ( or Martell ) is just the ancient French word for marteau ( hammer )
The D is soft, right
I'm going more for 30's than 25's now, but here it goes:
**Portugal:** earn 1400€ bruto (1000€ netto), save some 300-400€ after paying living expenses
**France:** earn 3000€ bruto (don't remember netto, maybe 1900€), save some 1000€ after paying living expenses
**Belgium:** earn 4300€ bruto (2700€ netto), save some 1500€ after paying living expenses
**Belgium, for your 25yrs old (my last salary):** earn 3600€ bruto (2300€ netto), save some 1200€ after paying living expenses
Always living alone in an apartment
All values for 14 salaries per year (so twice a year you get a full-paycheck bonus)
Exact same thing with us, and the Greeks also
The South of Europe is becoming just a retirement home for old Germans, Belgians, French, etc
that belgian wage is obscenely high for that age
2700 euro net when just graduated is a very high salary
May I ask what you studied/what field you are in
I think most starting salaries for having completed university would be around 2000 net but will rise quite a bit with how long you work in that field/job
But a lot of people get extra benefits such as company car, extra health insurance and what not
> You wont earn anything in the private sector
I was contacted by an engineering firm to work in Luxembourg (not many of those there
), and when asked for the net salary they paid the same thing as I did at the time in Belgium
Yeah
Same netto for 3x the housing prices
I don't think so
Banking there pays well tough, no
I mentioned that I'm already going for 30's, and it's an achievable wage of you work in STEM
2700 is for 5yrs experience (Mechanical Engineering), just graduating is more like 2200-2300
Rent, food, gas, the occasional night out (tough not too many, bar/restaurant life is expensive here)
So far Belgium has been the country with the higher salaries vs
cost of renting that I've personally seen
I suspect that in Germany you can make even more money and rents are similar, but it's difficult to access that
I had a Portuguese contract (" detached worker contract"), paid Portuguese taxes, even tough I was working in France for a French salary level
For that salary level, taxes in Portugal are higher than in France, for sure they were higher than 25%.
That was actually a low-ish salary in France
If you come from a good university directly to a good company, you can make a lot of money there
But most people (as I was) are hired as outsourcers, with shit/precarious conditions and low salaries
No, you also included a wage for 25 yrs old, which is still an obscenely high wage
May be achievable with a combination of good soft skills, working really hard, and plain luck, but extremely out of the norm in my experience
3600 gross at 25 is not difficult in STEM
Maybe not for the average worker, but for the average STEM worker is not unbelievable if you work at a big company
I work in STEM and know nobody at 25 who is even close to that
Traveling between the Netherlands, Belgium and France would become very confussing for tourists
The tax stream is reversed south to north
;-)
People would complain about struggling to find a new good frituur to get their fries from
Language swap, north is now probably less wealthy, different culture, completely different political views
And someone foreign trying to learn Welsh would now be pissed as the small differences are now not correct anymore
The actual tax stream is from Brabant to the periphery
That would stay the same
Counter to that, you would be able to visit a few new ones in a row which is always fun
The difference in wealth isn't between North and South but between Brabant and the rest of the country
Brabant would flip over ultimately changing nothing, and people will still complain about "transfers" from North to South
It is seen as gross
Cars that pass by will often honk if you are seen doing that
there are public urinals in open air
it's pretty common
otherwise it's looked down upon but bums still do it all the time, nobody cares because what are you gonna do
It is
Then why are there public urinals on some squares and such
In my experience nobody really cares
Ofc it is seen as gross to pee against a building or such tho
i have memories from high school of looking at my friends in the eyes when they were taking a piss so that they would feel gay and awkward
it was a common gig we did
I like my pasta still crunchy
On a serious note though al dente is fine for me but not a real must either I'm not difficult about it
My dad likes everything like pasta and vegetables overcooked though so when they cook it's gonna be soft pasta
Most of the people close to me hate al dente pasta
I personally hate mushy pasta (which is unfortunately the standard in Belgium as far as I know)
That's sooo annoying
The water is either 50°C or 1°C
Before I clicked  thought that word was a synonym for yeeting
I think they meant the car had a start-stop system so the car doesn't idle at red lights
As soon as you put it back in gear, the engine starts again automatically
The closest we have in Wallonia-Brussel, is [La dictée du Balfroid] A spelling contest where 6th grade children have to write a text read to them
It used to be shown live on  television (maybe still is, I don't know)
I think this concept is better that the spelling bee, because it's the same text for every children, it's more fair
And the words have some context within the text, not just random unrelated words
We used to have a spelling competition on tv here
It was once a year and aimed towards adults
Dutch is a disaster with weird spellings
Is it d/dt/t? Two O/E/A/U or maybe one
Is it oe/ou
I’ve struggled with my own first language since childhood
We have spelling tests in school, and every year there is a 'Grand Dutch Dictation' where hundreds of Flemish and Dutch people compete
Someone reads a complicated text aloud, you write it down, and the one with the fewest mistakes wins
Dutch can be a rather complicated language
Don't think it's even just a question of non-English speaking countries
I never came across one growing up in the UK
Here in the Dutch-speaking half of Belgium, there used to be a TV spelling competition, though
Dutch is a bit less regular in terms of spelling than e.g. Italian
Ly and j sound the same in modern Hungarian
> You can write [o], o, ô, au or eau for instance
No, o and ô don't sound the same, and o and au/eau don't sound the same either
When does ou sound like oe
In some rare French word
D/dt/t and double/single vowels is based on rules
You just have to apply them
You can't compare that with English orthography that just needs to be memorized
Those competitions are barely Dutch
So many French words that no one ever uses
Dutch spelling is pretty okay except for:
-ij or ei
-au(w) or ou(w)
-c or k/s
-Ctie or -Csie (C = any consonant)
And there are even some hidden rules for these kind of things
Loanwords tend to have au, ei and c. Strong verbs have ij, weak verbs have ei
Ou is always followed by W, D or T (except in the word count and some English loanwords)
Dutch children might also have problems with g/ch, v/f, z/s and aai/ei depending in their accent
But we can't change the spelling every time a sound merges somewhere in the Netherlands lol
On the other hand, Dutch children might not have a problem with -Ctie and -Csie like Flemish children
O sounds like ô before S and also at the end of words (when you ignore the silent letters): pro, mot, chose, poser etc
Belgian dutch kid here and while I dislike that we had to learn French I can't deny that having a good understanding of both a Germanic and a Latin language is incredibly benificial
Always write -en- except
...if the word has a plural with -s: groentesoep
...if it shouldn't be taken literally: reuzeleuk, apetrots
...if it's zonne-, mane- or koninginne-
I have never seen anyone make a mistake for this unless they are older and grew up with different rules
You always write the trema at the start of the second vowel sound
The ie vowel is spelled "i" in open, unstressed syllables in the middle of a word
Otherwise it's "ie". So bacteriën, knieën, oliën... For this exact same reason, you write "centrifuge" rather than "centriefuge" etc
I don't think children have a problem with this
But yes, it can be hard for adults who don't read that much
You will forget these kind of rules immediately
Also in West-Flanders
Some dialects in Flanders even distinguish ou and au
That rule got abolished in 2005
I think it is just these two rules now, with just those 3 exceptions
De geschiedenis van die tussenletters is best interessant
Voor samenstellingen gebruiken Germaanse talen de genitief ( -s-, -e- of -en-)
Die uitgangen begonnen hun eigen leven te leiden en zelfs in het Duits komt het niet steeds meer overeen met de genitief
Tegen het eind van de middeleeuwen sprak niemand nog met naamvallen, maar men bleef ze wel schrijven tot in de jaren 40
Tien jaar later kreeg men vanzelfsprekend moeite met het schrijven van samenstellingen, dus verzon men gewoon nieuwe regels
Schrijf een s wanneer je die hoort, schrijf e/en wanneer je een doffe e hoort
De N schrijf je alleen maar als het woord "in het meervoud hoort". Deze nieuwe regels leken heel simpel, maar bleken onmogelijk
Bessesap was zonder N want één bes heeft al sap, maar bessenpulp was met een N want voor pulp heb je blijkbaar meerdere bessen nodig
Vrouwenborst was met een N maar niemand begreep echt waarom
Er werd verwacht dat je enorme lijsten van samenstellingen vanbuiten leerde
Dus men besloot nieuwe, intuïtievere regels toe te passen in de jaren 90
De paardebloemregel waar jij het over had was omdat men biologische namen niet wou veranderen
Elke plant heeft een vaste Nederlandstalige wetenschappelijke naam
Maar tegen 2005 besloot men alsnog om ook de nieuwe regels toe te passen in de biologie
In het Zweeds verschijnen er in sommige samenstellingen soms klinkers als tussenletters (zoals -o- en -e-), maar dat valt ook niet te begrijpen zonder de naamvallen van Oud-Noors te kennen
Belgium:
Vote
Wait 2 years
Magic doesn't happen
Have an illegitimate government
Sleep
Repeat
Please wait for about 8 years while I type up a post that *vaguely* lets you know how it works
Kinda
The head of state is always the monarch but the head of the government is chosen among the parties that negotiate a majority government after the elections
Normally trough voting but last years the new trend is to choose them their selves and put all the winning parties off side
It's the 2nd time it lasted 500 days before they could get a goverment together
We have even ministers without votes
I wish we were more like you guys
Aaah
The goverment in 'lopende zaken'.
There's nothing illegitimate though
And don't start the "they didn't win" explanation
They sort of are both legitimate and illegitimate
They were not properly elected by popular vote, so in that sense, no, they are not legitimate
On the other hand, they were chosen after négociations, so in that sense, they are legitimate
My feeling is that out politics is so fucked up for the past 20+ years that nothing is legit anymore
Regardless of the political affiliation/regiin/language/etc
This country does not work anymore
We need global change in mindset in all political parties
What worked a long time ago does not anymore, and politicians need to realise that
While I agree our politics are fucked, our system was always a system of coalition, nothing illegitimate about it
Yes, other parties had more votes, but they don't have a majority
By their early 30's for sure, but most people I know aren't pressured to settle down in their 20's. Housing market is rather expensive so many stay with their parents until their late 20's. Granted they often have to pay a small ammount of rent as soon as they have a proper income
Both me and my sister stayed home until our late 20's without facing any real pressure from anywhere basically as far as I know
We both saved up until we could get the house we wanted with a small loan and then moved out
This is from a rather wealthy family by the way
It wasn't a "we totally can't afford it" thing
It was a "we can afford way more if we play this smart and don't rush it
"(parents told me literally 30 minutes ago their 10 year old business was appraised for 4 million
They're looking to sell and retire)
Could have moved out at 22 and saved €400/month
Or I stay and save €2000/month
Not a hard decision for me
The deal was basically "as long as you save up a lot of money we're willing to pay for X, Y, Z." My sister wanted to buy a house with her boyfriend and my parents were rather pushy in that she needed to own and pay for half of it for security reasons
Hence they also encouraged her to save
So all our income basically went to a bank account and we rarely took anything from it
I left home with 250k in the bank
No at least in in the 20s by the time they get over 30 they may get some minor shame
Yea, reading it again I see it
Just defaulted to personal anecdote
Still, the not being pressured into moving out should still be consistent I think
At least in my wider family
Don't think anyone moved out before 26
West Flanders - Farmers with a dialect so unintelligible from regular Dutch it might as well be its own language, if it even is a language at all
East Flanders - Ghent is a West Flemish colony
Antwerp - arrogant and drug dealers
Limburg - slow semi Germans
Brussels - place to go if you want to get stabbed at night
Charleroi - same as the above, and it's also incredibly ugly
Belgian Luxembourg - nobody lives here
Wallonia in general - lazy
Eupen Malmedy - rumoured to have mythical creatures called German speaking Belgians
What's with the royalists
Hey our language isn't horrible, Dutch from the Netherlands is
Leuven = snobby student capital0
Luik = Fortresses and forests, sometimes both at the same time
Namen = we care so little, we just gave it "name" as it's name
Region Antwerpen (not the city) = rich racists
Aalst = worst part of the marginal triangle
Ive actually never heard a stereotype about flemish brabant
As a Walloon currently learning Dutch, I gotta say Dutch from the Netherlands is awful but Flemish Dutch is aight
You guys are cool
It does not have more crime than your average European capital but it does have more crime than the rest of Belgium, it's only a meme after all
There are some areas you best avoid but still it's not like I would be anxious walking alone in Brussels at night
The only thing I know about it is ''het pajottenland''
That's a good reason to be fair
Molenbeek and Gare du Nord
Other than that you'll be fine really, no worries
Brussels is a nice city and Belgium is a beautiful country
Lots of great architecture and art history in the north, lots of nature in the south
Visit Bruges and Ghent if you get the chance
It's great
I live in Belgium and (in normal times) leave the country about once a month, even if it's just a day-trip to the Netherlands
It’s very nice from a cultural perspective
I love that I don’t have to travel far to be able to discover other cultures and places which feel so distinctly different from home
I can assume that for people travelling for their work it’s maybe not as nice that they might come across a different language and different customs
For me it depends on what you’d call often, but we did take smaller trips abroad more easily
Sometimes for leisure but our closest IKEA is in France as well
And I can be an international student in the Netherlands and still be relatively close to home
I grew up in Germany close the Dutch and Belgian border
We went to visit the neighbouring countries quite a lot, sometimes just for the groceries
There were certain things we'd always buy in the Netherlands, and things we always got in Belgium
And sometimes it's just boring to always see the same stuff at the supermarket, so a change of scenery is always interesting
I'm very used to just taking a quick drive to another country, it's just fun to have an many interesting places close by
You can drive 1h30m in any direction from our capital and leave the country
That fact has always amazed me
Not now we don't since international travel is still prohibited
But in Normal Times people just pop over the border fo work, shopping, leisure or just because they feel like
Depending on where live, you may even need to cross the border for your commute because it's faster than staying within the country
I live in Antwerp near the Netherlands, lots of people go to Breda for shopping, and I personally pop over a few times a year to go scubadiving in Zeeland
At least a few times each year, we spend the weekends abroad in our family (either with my parents, or with my SO's)
Usually Netherlands due to proximity, but we've done France and Germany a few times as well
If I bike an hour north I'm in Holland, 2 hours and I'm in France
It's still cool te be able to be in another country and culture even if it's close-by
Stays something special to experience differences in architecture, landscape, language, food, town signs
It's always a bit like going on vacation, even if you're just going to Auchan to buy water or st
Especially not now with Corona and all, as trips across the border are not recommended right now
Overall it is pretty nice, it actually makes travel by bus quite feasible, which made for some very cool school trips and summer camps back when I was younger
It decreases a bit as you age
Even though my country is small, I'm still 45 minutes away from the closest border
That is not a very long drive, but not a trip you make on the daily
Depending on where you travel to, it's also possible you don't speak the language, which is not very comfortable, as you can imagine
It feels similar, I would guess, as driving to another state in the US
But instead of being slightly different, you can get in an entirely different culture after driving but an hour
Belgian here
We visited London(we took a limo at our hotel around 1am with 10(no teachers), drank champagne, etc
), Paris and Barcelona(near a beach so go camp fires and a lot of alcohol) for several days
Lille is technically another country but that's just a day trip
Was to improve our French
I did everything using English
Haha
In high school we went to London, Paris and Prague (and also a day trip to Amsterdam)
London and Paris were tradition, the third destination would change over the years (it's been Berlin and Rome as well)
I would say, many different beer glasses
Beer is to Belgium what wine is to France, which means that there are many norms around it and we respect it more
And thus, every beer or at least type of beer (we have a huge variety) has to be drank in the right type of glass ([for example] So, it's not uncommon in Belgian houses to have a cupboard/dresser full of different beer glasses, basically being nearly as well equipped as a bar/pub holder (but with only one or two glasses of the same type or brand)
Because a beer in the wrong type of glass is seen as "blasphemous" here
I approve your message
And maybe also a deep fryer we all have at home
People who don't use the correct beer glass belong in prison
It's the only on I have at home
Very common in Belgium as well and I don't see them disappearing any time soon (seems to hold up trough generational changes)
Same for Belgium
> beers brand did as a gimmick and to make money
There is objectively a little bit of that
But, at the very least, you "should" have a glass of each type/shape
Not *obligatoirement* the right brand, but at least the right shape for the type of beer
A bit like you don't drink red wine in the same type of glass as champagne for example
In France too, types of wines are drank is their appropriate type of glass
Sure, some of them are
But what I mean is this (as already replied) "you "should" have a glass of each type/shape
Not imperatively the right brand, but at least the right shape for the type of beer
A bit like you don't drink red wine in the same type of glass as champagne for example
In France too, types of wines are drank is their appropriate type of glass
And a croque/waffle iron
It's a gimmick but as usual, gimmicks and the real thing are intertwined in Belgium
I guess so, most people I know have one, including myself
Why
It is not common in the Netherlands
Yes, at least good beers
It's relatively OK with inferior/cheap beers, such as pils and ales (which, by our standards, are just the adult version of lemonade), but with real beers, the ones that are at 7°-12° (the trappists, specials, abbey's), don't do it
We use a towel when handwashing
Or your dishwasher just takes care of it for you
Unless you're a student
Sure we do it, but we do it for beer too
And countries like France and Italy, which have good wines, will take more care about that that in countries with bad wine or no real wine culture
I'm quite sure that in Nordic countries, they don't really care as much as long a this is a wine glass, nor do they in Romania, where their wine is generally so bad it's seen as ok to put coca/cola in it
Beer is treated in Belgium the same way, with the same respect, French people show to wine
Wine countries are France and Italy
Spanish, German and Austria wines are considered sub-par wines compared to the ones of France and Italy
I don't agree with that
Every single one of those other countries also offer excellent wines

I am running a Minecraft server with some friends
We're not strictly European, though about half our players are European, mostly Belgian, and the server is hosted in Germany
We got people from outside Europe too, like from Panama and Australia
It's the plain Vanilla experience, although we made a small server modification ourselves to sync the in-game chat with our Discord
We're a tightly knit community of around 25 active players, of which three to ten are usually online at the same time
We're behind a whitelist, and usually new players only make it into the server by being referred to a friend
If you want you can send me a DM, and I can add you
Whitelisted servers can give a true feeling of multiplayer survival Minecraft an open server never can
There are some basic rules, like no raiding, griefing or being overly disrespectful to other members of the community, or abusing exploits that we as a community agreed in where a bit too OP, like certain item dupes
Stuff like AFKing or automatic farms are completely fine
Send me a private message if you're interested
Yeah it was fun, a bit of a shame it doesn't update yet
I'd like us to take a page from the US and allow for turning right on red at some intersections
They started doing it for bicycles at some intersections with a new sign, but there's lots of lights where I'd love the option to that with my car as well
Free table water in restaurants and even pubs
Absolutely ridiculous that we don't do it
I have found Belgian beers in Italy to
Blame the banks
Not an issue for our shop, swimming pool business so profit marges are dumb
€11 goods sold for €34(€42
00 with tax) but if you have thin profit marges and every transaction costs you €0
20 that's going to cut rather deep
I'm just annoyed that at the end of the day the mask is more to protect others and less so yourself
So I'm certainly going to wear one if I feel slightly under the weather in the future but it's not going to do me a lot of good if others don't.
Isn't there like minimum parking spots in the US for exactly that reason
(most of Europe has a max)
How can they have that and still fuck it up
Thing is, both France and Wallonia aren't flat like the Netherlands, so, even with good cycling infrastructure, it wouldn't become as popular as in the Netherlands
I think most Dutchies couldn't cycle in Wallonia even with Dutch-level infrastructure, too many hills and slopes, their legs are too used to flat terrain
Or to get rid of black money
Someone came over to pay €985 for something we sold her by mail and had delivered to her in cash
Aside from the roads thing, most older buildings are at least to some extent considered heritage, so renovating a house can be very hard
And if you stumble upon anything while digging, be prepared to have endless construction delays by  archaeologists coming to check out what you found
>Old houses and flats have terrible insulation and windows let in so much wind through the edges of the crappy sash single glazed windows - it's very unpleasant
Hard to heat as a result
Oh man yeah
I can still remember back in the day when we couldn't go to the toilet downstairs during the winter as it was too close to the outer wall of the house and the water would freeze up
We did some renovations since but we couldn't install double glass on the street side since it wasn't possible in the old framing and we didn't want to replace it (pretty sure wouldn't even be allowed anyway)
Every year some West Flemish farmer hits a bomb as well
Tactical voting is not really a thing here, as we elect our representatives who try to form a coalition with other parties in order to secure a majority in parliament
Last election some people did not vote for the far right party (known as Vlaams Belang) as since 1991, all Flemish parties agreed to NEVER EVER EVER form a coalition with them
As a result, they will never get the chance to govern, unless with an absolute majority
That being said, they were the second biggest party in Flanders last election, and the biggest party has a similar hard stance on immigration
There were talks but no accord, as they didn't have a majority together and all other parties were very clear that they would never govern in a coalition with Vlaams Belang
Needless to say, this made a lot of people angry and our next elections might go crazy
Never that I've heard of but we don't have a president anyway
We have a similar thing called 'Drie koningen', where kidd dress up as the three wise men from the bible and go door to door on January 6th in exchange for sweets
I thinks this is also bounded per region
My nieces for example still do this in the region Mechelen, but I never heard of it before they did that and I live in northern Antwerp (onle 50km away)
This is indeed how you do it
We have bise and non-bise regions, so you have to be prepared either way
edit: typo
Also there are some region where you do a different number of Bise
3 is the right number
Three is the only right number :p
All who never Bise are prude, all whom the number is one are unpolite, 2 is the number of a Conman but 4 and 5 are right out
You are bang on the money
None or one is impolite, and two feels fake/forced
Three all the way
You learn how to deal with it
Sometimes it won't work so one will have to reverse
With experience you'll know the spots where you can pass freely at high speed , etc
Not exactly true
I went to Ireland a few years ago and to make the comparison complete, there should be a rough stone wall on the right edge of the road
Kinda like [this example] but without the grass buffer inbetween
I was impressed by how courteous the drivers were
People instinctively backing up or setting themselves aside to let the other pass, and always kindly waving when you passed, or when you let them pass
Quite different from driving in and around Antwerp
Yeah driving in Belgium cities generally sucks in comparison of rural places where people are much friendly
I love it when it's a place where waving to the other driver as thanking sign is common
Another reason why this might be impossible is a fenomenon called "hollow roads", where the road erodes over centuries of usage before being paved properly
This way earth walls of 2-3 meters can form at both sides of the road because the road has sunk into the ground
There you need to pass eachother at widened passing points as well
the road was likely there before the car, and just paved at some point
For Flanders: [Vlaanderen boven]
It is mostly satirical
A mix of praising and stinging Flemish people
For example there are the lines:
• "Waar het geld in het zwart vloeit"  which basically says it is the place "where money flows dirty".
•"Waar een g soms een h is" (in west Flanders a 'g' often sounds like a 'h')
In the chorus he also sings:
•"Waar mensen belangrijk zijn, en buiken/pensen omvangrijk zijn"
(Where people are important, and tummies/paunches are bulky)
A song I very much associate with France is "Douce France" by Trenet, in particular I associate it with Southern France
To explain the "zwart geld": "zwart geld" is money that's never reported to authorities
"Omdat mensen belangrijk zijn" was also a very famous CVP slogan at the time the song was made, back when they were still the dominant political party in Flanders
As for Belgium as a whole, maybe "J'aime la vie" by Sandra Kim is one of the most widly appreciated songs
Loch Lomond is probably the song I associate the most with Scotland
I honestly thought that [this] would be the unofficial anthem of the Netherlands
I love "Merck toch hoe sterck", we often sing it at cantussen (traditional student drinking and singing parties, like "Kneipe" in Germany)
Bella Ciao was already a huge song before Casa de Papel
\*Money that should've normally been taxed, to be completely correct
Example: You let a plumber fix your sink, and he agrees to be paid in cash and he doesn't officially bill you, so it is cheaper for you (as taxes aren't included)
In that case you would've paid him in 'zwart' (black) and the money he now has is called "zwart geld" (black money)
Ah yes, our one and only Eurovision win
But yeah, I agree, but I wouldn't say it fits our countries spirit so to say
Would be a bit weird to have "Oh Canada" as the British anthem though
Except for Jacques Brel ;)
Yeah, better explanation
Hmm yeah, you're right
It's hard to find a song that both halves of our country can identify with though
Gwlad
Gwlaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
Grand anthem really
I didn't, almost never do, especially not when in discussion
I just wanted to remark that Bella Ciao was widely known where I live before the series (which isn't that big here I think)
Exactly
So I wonder what song Walloons would pick
Blankenberge in Belgium
Literally translates to “whites mountain”, considering Belgium is as flat as it gets and Blankenberge is a seaside town the name really doesn’t add up
East-Flanders is the second most Western located province in the country
It's the same for Walloons, Wallachia and many more  words with Wal(l)
Besides our Bergen 'Mons', we also have Heist-op-den-bergh, which, given the likelihood of 'heist' being an old cognate of 'highest', translates to
'Highest on the mountain'.
However, like most of Flanders, it's on completely flat land
I used to live there
There really is a mountain but he's only 50 meters high lol
There is this cartoon about Blankenberge
You have a family of Africans who visit Blankenberge and then you have this extreme right wing guy who point to the sign and say: “can’t you read
[the picture]
I think that it's up to the people to protect their own culture and make it live
If their culture dies, it's not because of some external force from the EU or globalisation or whatever else, it's because they stopped caring
If some of their cultural traits (e.g. local festivals, small dialect, etc
) aren't attractive enough to young people, it will wither away until it disappears
It's up to them to make their culture attractive in order to keep it alive
I take the time
Life is a marathon, not a sprint
It's useless to work like a donkey and getting burned out
You gotta realise that you gotta work till your 70
Unless you got an alternative plan and you can handle it, take your tim to live
Lie is too short too miss out on it
how old were you in the 90s?
When I was still active, I made sure I had time for a proper meal and enough sleep
It's nice to have a few autistic genes
It's a matter of organisation
Planning is key
Create a weekly menu
Go shopping during the weekend, or shop on the way back home in shops you know you can get in, buy stuff, and go in minutes
Buying a dishwasher also helps It does mean you get about an extra half hour of time free for more important activities
Go to bed at least 8 hours before your alarm wakes you, and do so every day
Create a routine
TV off at least half an hour before going to bed, the same with your smartphone
Get one of those apps that puts your phone in night "do not disturb unless I win the lottery" mode at a certain hour
Cutting back on alcohol also helps
So does removing all energy drinks from your menu
A nice cuddly partner also helps, but you can't get mine
Beating the world record for the longest period without a government has been something Belgium has been really into the past decade
Currently we’re on our way to beat our 2011 record for 589 days without a government
I bet none of these foreign losers can come even close to beating us
So sad for them
Same here
None of these foreigners are on our level tbh
It really is getting pathetic to see how way out of their league we are
If you know something is a problem it does not become less of a problem just because you do it in a remote area
In fact it's probably even more annoying because the clean up crews now have larger areas to cover
right after WW2 or in the 60's/70's ?
Brussels doesn't feel Belgian to me at all
Not just all of the foreigners, also all of the large buildings and ad billboards and trash everywhere make it feel so un-Belgian
Definitely Brussels
Obviously as its the capital and our biggest city, you see more POC than you would in a "regular" city, but you're also likely to hear every European language under the sun if you hang around the European quarter for a while
>Maastricht feels the most foreign
yea I have been to Maastricht many times and it feels very Belgian
Yeah, it always blows my mind how familiar it is
If you remove all the cycling infrastructure and most bikes, you honestly have a Walloon looking city
Even the landscapes around the city reminds me of a lot of Wallonia
[Maastricht] vs [Namur]
All of the cities in territories that used to be ruled by foreign powers count for me
Dunkirk feels very Belgian to me and while on vacation in Alsace, I constantly felt like I was in Germany because of the buildings and town names
Nice used to be an Italian city as well
It’s a world language, we can pronounce most foreign words with a little practice, we have latin and german influences, so it unites the latin languages and the germanic languages
Why not:
The Dutch speak it too
I would enjoy half of Europe talking Flemish and the other  half talking French
That way we can trashtalk bigger numbers over their language
Same as English TBF
Organisation or organization, color or colour
I'm Flemish and I can confirm that it's not that easy to learn German sorry not sorry
Easy to learn for speakers of Indo-European languages yes, not so much for other languages
I speak Walloon, but if it became the European Lingua Franca it would be very weird tbh
Dutch it is then
We have so many dialects we need subtitles to each other, so it wouldn't unite anything
I knew some French person would say this
My French friends told me in Australia they didn't like the Australians cause they didn't try to speak French to them
So sick of this chauvinistic bs
Where do I aply
I'll do it, I'll translate documents, please
Forget about the Dutch g sound
You can say it in a much softer way, which will make it sound more pleasing
And it will still be proper Dutch
Okay, but what if I said I don't have the patience to learn it
* Forcing all the population to speak French : it made Wallonia loose its historical and culture language(s), and it alienated the Flemings, Dutch-speaking Brabanders and Limburgers, which in the past were different identities/cultures, favorising the birth of the Flemish movement
Being a centralised country was a mistake too
* Letting Léopold II get Congo, for quite obvious reasons
Going apart from the Netherlands
I see this as an absolute win
(though not in earnest, you're one of the best neighbours a country can wish for <3)
Napoléon was the mistake, he destroyed the French revolution
Personally, anything in single digit Celcius is considered chilly
Cold is when it's freezing, normal is anything between 10-18, 18-25 is "the fuck is this summer or what" and anything above 25 is too hot
Anything above 33 is fucking horrible
For Belgium, based on our very high humidity :
- Freezing : -infinite to 0
- Cold : 0 to 15
- Chilly : 15 to 18
- Nice : 19 to 23
- Warm : 24 to 27
- Too hot : anything above 28
I wear a binder, so my temperature is a bit higher most of the time
Cold: -10 to 0
Chilly: 1-9
Nice: 10-18
Not so nice, but still okay: 18-22
Please don't: 23 - 25
Stop: 25-27
Too hot now: 28-30
I can't go outside: 30+
I live at 50
666379°N, and it's ok
I'm not someones who spend a lot of time outside, so, I don't really care about short days
And anyway, short days are soon over, since th 21st/22nd of December, they'll start getting longer (the true origin and meaning of Christmas by the way)
That we are a country
The only things uniting us are the king and football
HR was still filling in the paperwork
Well sure, there's plenty more stuff we share
However we very rarely feel 'Belgian', that feeling only comes with football pretty much
I know a Polish tongue twister (one about a beetle making noise in a field, can’t write it though) and how to say merry christmas
One time I said "yo tambien hablo español" to an Italian girl
We date for 3months haha
Ah yes that’s the one, I’ll definitely check out the poem as well (though I won’t understand anything else I’m afraid) and a wesołych świąt to you too
Ottignies part : [the instrumental of this song]
Louvain-la-Neuve part : [the instrumental of this song]
And I fucking love it
[Arlon]
Even the principal church sing it with it's carillon for the hours so I could usually hear it when I was still in school there
I'm giving our government capability to cooperate
Muhahaha
I give you five governments
What he's really offering is our ability to not take yourself too seriously
Which hardcore are you talking about
hardcore alone means nothing when it comes to music, plenty different genres use it
You have hardcore in rock/punk/metal, you have hardcore in rap, you have hardcore in electro
Huzzah a country of culture aswell
Ooh quite a contender to the Belgian political shambles, impressive
Well, hardcore is its own genre in punk/metal too, and it existed before electro/techno hardcore
So, when I read the word hardcore, what comes to mind to me is [this] or [this] or [this] if going back to the roots/beginning of the genre
Knokke Le-Zoute boys/girls
Based after a rich beachtown where a lot of entitled people go to
Also know as your average fils a papa
Belgian here
For some reason, I've never visited the Flanders Fields museum in Ypres (a World War I museum), even though I only live 20 km away from it
It's one of the most important tourist attractions in the entire region, and possibly in the entire country from a British perspective (given the huge amount of Brits visiting Ypres every year)
I don't know if that's something a lot of people do in Belgium, but I personally say "1 crocodile", "2 crocodiles", etc
Crocodile has the same meaning in French as in English
Why a crocodile ? Because it works
Same in Dutch: een-en-twin-tig, twee-en-twin-tig, drie-en-twin-tig (21, 22, 23)
As usual, STEM degrees are in high demand, especially civil engineers, as most of them have a job waiting for them while they're finishing their degrees
Law is a very solid choice as well
Most of them end up doing something law-related, but a law degrees gives you access to pretty much anything that is not science-related
Physics, Math and Computer science are usefull masters to have because they give you acces to jobs you would not relate to it
Obvious things ypu could do is get a Phd
and do research, you could teach etc
, but finance and insurance companies are actively searching for people with these degrees
Engineering, medicine (or any health care related degree) will give you nice jobs aswell
The most usefull thing you can have is a drivers licence, as even if you don't have a highschool degree you can find a decent job with it
Recognized does not mean of the same value though
A dutch nursing degree isn't seen as a full qualification here in Belgium for example
The Russian doctor who came to Belgian also had to take certain classes and tests
There are people who actually care about that
Like, I know it exists but if that's something that dictates what you wish to do with your life there is something seriously wrong with you
Might be because I don't really notice it here
A good construction worker isn't really seen lower than say, somebody working at a bank
Professor and such is another matter
The good old "baraque à frites" that we have in Belgium and France
Lights being on all of the time on the highways at night
Vending machines that sell beer cans in public spaces like train stations
>I've heard that our daily TV news programmes are way longer than what's normal elsewhere, they last for more than an hour typically
Don't know how true that is though
The news in belgium typically lasts 30-40 minutes
I guess you really like to be thorough
I'm not that patriotic by any means, but I've yet to find a place outside of Belgium that serves proper fries
I mean, bread is the thing you get for free here in restaurants
Wouldn't describe it as "loads of bread" but still
> black licorice
That's everywhere, and there no not-black licorice
I'll admit that your bread is the best one, though I hate to compliment the french
I prefer their croissants but I prefer our normal bread over their sticks personally :p.
Doesn't the Netherlands have "wapenstilstand" on the 11th of November
WW1 thing I suppose
An American friend pointed this out to me in a mixture of awe and shock
I never really had noticed because we grew up with these
But he was right, never saw a public beer vending machine outside of Belgium
They are not that common anymore, because sentiments are changing a bit
But I know a few night shops that stil have them outside
So they can serve the public 24/7
You can find some too in Brussels Midi Station, where the Eurostar arrives
Belgian beer culture is a thing, had my first (small) beer when I was 10 with my parents and grand parents
"red licorice" is mostly an American thing, and doesn't actually have licorice in it
It's an improper name
Come to Belgium in that case
You go out as a construction worker at 7am
Stop at the "hot" bakeries(those that make it themselves instead of buy it and sell it) and and buy all sorts of goodies, still hot, and cheap as fuck
Hell, once had to leave at 5
30am and just knocked at one before it was open to get my stuff
It's one of those things I miss a lot when I travel
TIL
Yea, hence why I said "WW1 thing I suppose". :p
So many interesting answers
Well, no one is innocent, I guess
What do you mean by innocent in this context
Definitely the Netherlands
If you think what happened in Congo is terrible, well, the Netherlands colonialism was the inspiration for Leopold II, he learnt his methods from them
And of course, their oppression against Belgium, and the fact they waged war to try and prevent independence
At least in Belgium, we know about the colonial atrocities, they are talked about, and not denied
But everyone seems to forget about the Dutch atrocities, they fly under the radar
And Dutch people still refuse to recognise they were oppressors when it comes to Belgium, they still seem to think they were right and that somehow we are the bag guy from freeing ourselves from their tyranny
Only if you compare it with other second-half 19th century colonial empires
I'm quite sure that colonial empires in the Americas were far worse than Belgian Congo, or even the Congo Free State
At least, there are Congolese people left
We can't really say the same for indigenous Americans in many countries
And where they are still alive, they are a small minority and are largely discriminated (with a very few exceptions like Bolivia)
You can blame the eradication of native Americans on diseases, but it was also the case in Congo as Malaria and Sleeping sickness were at an epidemic level at the time and probably killed more Congolese than Belgian policies did
Besides, the triangular trade and the conditions of exploitation of African slaves in the sugar cane plantations were also worse than what happened in Congo
They dropped like flies, which is why there was a constant need of new slaves coming from Africa
They didn't even have time to reproduce
Worked to death in a few years, then the new batch arrives
1918
Either 1908 (Belgian Congo) or 1885 (Congo free state) make sense but I don't get why you went with 1918 here
Everybody knows about Congo atrocities, it is one of the most famous thing, and no one denies it, even in Belgium
> there were few colonial empires that were worse than Belgium’s.
Indeed, there was the Dutch one, the main source of inspiration of Leopold II
What hands
We cut those off, y'know
I was specifically talking about the harsh conditions in Brazil or in the Caribbeans
In the US, for instance, slavery was less perilous and slaves indeed reproduced and the population grew
But that was almost an exception on the American continent
Still, slavery was only one part of my comment
There is the whole annihilation of native Americans thing too
I stand by my previous comment that colonization of the Americas was much worse than Congo
> Why do you feel the need to compare at all
Because OP started the comparison game
I quote:
> Belgium is often seen as rather innocent and harmless, but its colonial empire was probably **the worst out of all of them**.
I went on to discuss why I don't think that it was the worst out of all of them
> And why specifically did you choose slavery in the US when the US is not even a European colonial power
Where did I mention the US
I mentioned the American colonies, but I wasn't referring to the US
Did you know that America was a whole continent
I actually had in mind Spanish colonies when writing my comment, as well as in the Caribbeans
Well, on Reddit it is definitely not ignored, it's the one I have seen the most spoken about, while British, French, German, Dutch colonial crimes are never spoken about
I think the idea that Congo is forgotten about is widely outdated, it is the most spoken about these days, the most famous case of colonialism gone wrong (not that there is colonialism gone right mind you)
Maybe it was often ignored a few decades ago, but this statement isn't valid anymore today
Otherwise, Belgium wouldn't be the most common answer in this thread
Everybody knows about it
Perhaps is it because there is this constant bashing about Belgian Congo here on Reddit, and it's fucking tiring
Belgium deserves to be bashed about it, entirely
But the issue is that the people who do it are terribly uninformed about what happened there
They just know about cutting hands, '10' million dead and sometimes have heard that there are still Leopold II statues in Belgium, end of the story
Then they are outraged when they see Belgians coming with facts
People accuse these Belgians of being all kinds of evil because they assume that they just want to minimize (or even deny) what happened
If you point out that the Belgian government had no power whatsoever in Congo before 1908, you get accused of downplaying the involvement of Belgium
If you dispute the 10 millions dead figure (which is more of a guess dating back from the early 20th century, without census), you are downplaying the horrors that happened
If you mention that other nationalities were involved in the Congo Free State as companies and mercenaries, then you are rejecting the fault onto others
And if you dare say that it wasn't a genocide, by the commonly accepted definition of the word, then oh dear, you are a negationist
It seems that people just want to have a 100% evil colonial Belgium to bash so that they can think "at least our colonialism wasn't that bad compared to theirs" and sleep better at night, I suppose
When you see such discussion weekly here, your patience runs out
I imagine that you would understand that
I also see this with the US being blamed for a lot of stuff, sometimes unjustly, in European subs
Ah shit, here we go again
Belgium is one big mess of autonomous regions, and still nobody is happy
Belgium has 3 communities and 3 regions
The communities handle cultural matters (including education)
They are the Flemish, French and German community
The regions handle economical and territorial matters
They are the Flemish, Walloon and Brussels region
Flemish and French community have a say in the cultural and educational matters in the Brussels region
German community is part of the Walloon region
There are a total of 5 governments (federal government makes for the sixth)
Flemish government for Flemish region and community
Brussels government for Brussels region
German government for the German community
French government for the French community
Walloon government for the Walloon region
They are currently looking into combining the French and Walloon government into one single government
As you see, it's complicated
When I have a few hours, I will explain it for you
Our autonomous regions have a country
> They are currently looking into combining the French and Walloon government into one single government
That wouldn't be possible because of the German community
However, ever since transfers between federal entities was made possible, a lot of Walloon regional competences were partially or totally transferred to the German community
That's indeed a more accurate way to describe us
It would be possible under the proposed "4 (or 2+2) states model", where the communities are abolished and all competences are transferred to the regions
OMG I have a pair of those always lying around on my desk somewhere
I love them a lot, I use them for everything, cutting my nails, cutting paper, cutting threads, sorry but even getting some of the dirt from underneath my fingernails (they've got a pretty fine thin tip, super useful), stabbing holes in things (like paper) etc
It's one of the items I made sure to bring along when studying abroad for 2 years
I never knew it was a certain brand
Only now I looked at the brand on the scissors and it is Fiskars indeed
Good to know, if this one ever breaks or if I ever lose it, I'll know how to find another one
&#x200B;
Apart from that, I don't think I've seen it in other places, I don't think it's necessarily a thing in Belgium (or maybe it is but I don't pay attention to other people's scissors)
I don't even know where I got mine from
Probably took it from my parents' house but not sure where they got it from
We would be part of France, what a terrible nightmare
It just would'nt exist anymore
Me not like it
French tyranny again !
I have no idea how that would look, Belgium with a government
I prefer no government to the terrible French government
Your government is a nightmare
with the current political state of our country, yes, very
Teachers of Europe, how are your students doing in 2020/2021
How far behind are they
Do you think they will get back on track
In Dutch we have the word "leerachterstand" (learning delay) when a student has not learned yet what is expected of him at that age
Do you think they will be able to overcome this delay and get back on track
I would also like to know how your students are doing emotionally compared to adults coping with the lockdown
I also wonder if there are differences across Europe
Oh wow, this was me at age 12-14 (2009-2011)
I took part in a school musical and got a very minor role with 2 sentences
I always went to repetitions even when I wasn't needed, just to flee home
That musical saved my mental health and grades, even though I did feel bad for getting such a minor role
My parents eventuallu decided that they would divorce once me and my siblings are graduated (they didn't want to be bad parents), and in the meantime they would just ignore eachother
We are almost all graduated now and they don't even speak of divorcing anymore
They think they're such great parents for not divorcing but don't seem to realize that the yelling took its toll on us
I feel so bad for you
Things will get better once everyone is vaccinated
I know that will take a few months, but you can do it
Why should a Greek person need Dutch language lessions
Not really
We don't really have dumplings in the traditional assortment of pastry
Usually more like 3 AM and more beers (or 4 strong belgian beers), and I would hope to find a frituur still open, otherwise it's usually döner
Bit early, but definitely a Julientje
Fries saté spices, flemish stew sauce, viandel (fried "sausage"), fried onions and mayo
Some fries probably, maybe pita or kebab, perhaps even a pizza if I'm with friends
Kapsalons are so goodddd
That's how you know German beers aren't proper beer but only flavored water
With 14 real beers, you would be too drunk to manage to go home
And Belgians
The [Atomium] or the buildings of the [Grand-Place]
The Atomium in Brussels, Belgium
One of the coolest building I've ever seen
Internationally it's likely the Atomium, but nationally I would like to argue for the Palace of Justice
It's been under renovation for so long  that the scaffolding is starting to disintegrate
I was thinking about the Atomium as well
I know it's not as iconic for the country and that I'm a little (or very) biased being from Antwerp, but I think [Antwerpen-Centraal Station] deserves a mention :)
I agree
Such a beautiful castle, and the military tattoo is amazing
I’d argue that the old town hall with its astronomical clock is the most iconic building in Prague
Arn't there quite a few hills in Ljubljana ? Must be hard without any gears on your bike !
&#x200B;
edit: looked it up and apparantly it's only the South-East part of the city that has hills
I hope you're comuting on the other side ;)

Went in Feb right before covid got big
Radiation is a bit anything higher than background
Anything "dangerous" you see on any tour would take days of constant exposure before it'd be a lethal dose
Lots of trees everywhere, even on the rooftops of lower buildings
In abandoned villages it's completely overgrown, fallen across houses etc
Didn't see a lot of wildlife
Saw fox tracks in the snow, and a deer or something similar in the woods
Couple of dogs in Pripyat, one at DUGA (Tarzan <3 ), more at the NPP but there are workers there who feed them
Oh and two black cats at a junkyard

com, decently prized, very informed guide
January 1790 - December 1790: United Belgian States
1830 - 1914: Kingdom of Belgium
1918 - 1940: Kingdom of Belgium
1944 - ... : Kingdom of Belgium
The country has a whole have been free since 1830 to 1914, 1918 to 1940 and 1944 to nowday but some part of our kingdom has been free before like the prince évêché of liège before the Austrian/Spanish lowland
Nicosia, I didnt know what I was expecting but it was definitely underwhelming
Ooooh
the amazing ribs from Meštiansky pivovar
yummy
Didn't try it
I also tried their grilled trout which was prepared with small pieces of bacon it was amazing as well
I don't think they would comment on it, even if they might not like it
They are paid to serve you the drink, not to comment on what you order
And if they would make such comments, they would probably loose many customers for their lack of respect for them
Now, however, instead of asking for the cheapest shot/beverage here, you would simply look at the menu and ask for the cheapest thing you saw on it
Asking to a server "the cheapest you have" would seem a bit weird, since usually, you take time to look on the menu before ordering anything
The only time you don't look the menu is to ask something generic you are sure they have : "a 33/pils", "a cola", "a coffee", "a glass of wine".
to add: since a 33'er is almost always the cheapest, putting up a pinky finger (belgian symbol for ordering a 33'er) is quite possibly synonymous with asking for the cheapest beverage
probably out of date, but when i was in school (about 20-15 years ago) it was: Ancient egypt and the fertile crescent (mostly focused on egypt), Ancient Greece, The Roman Empire (some sidenote mention of the celtic civilisations living here prior to incorporation in the roman empire
The quote "Fortisimi sunt Belgae" is guaruanteed mentioned in every textbook in Belgium)
In Dutch it is pronounced, you would say "Haa" but in flanders it's also common to hear something like "hash".
In my personal dialect I do drop the "h" in some words like "heel" (very" I would say "eel", certainly when speaking fast
Last one is not correct
We pronounce Y like ea in wear
If you spell it
It would be pronounced /ɛi/, è is a different sound
Monaco, because it is just a city full of tax evaders, and doesn't seem really interesting
Its global architecture isn't beautiful, and I can see better nature and towns in the part of France surrounding it, such as the "Parc naturel régional des Préalpes d'Azur" and the "Parc national du Mercantour". I don't feel attracted by Mediterranean French cities, smaller towns and villages that aren't on the coast are better : not overly touristic, not full of ugly apartment blocks
I would visit any other of the European countries
If you say Russia because of the government, shouldn't you also say Belarus and Turkey
>governments
I  could be wong, but I think Turkey is the only country that recognizes Northern Cyprus, so *technically* it's just government lol
Well, I'm sure you can find interesting or beautiful things in Monaco, but I wouldn't pay/travel specially to go there
I've always used Perpètes-les-bains, first time I hear about the geese variant
Another one in dutch (Belgium) is tsjakamakka, a made up name for an unknown place far away
We use a made-up name in Flanders (at least aroud Antwerp): **Chakamaka** or **Jacamaca**.
I think it's Timboektoe
In Belgian Dutch we also refer to 'Chakamaka' (Zjakkemakke, Jacamaca) which is a fictional place
The one time a Dutch tourist in Antwerp, sitting on a terrace with view on the 123 metres tall tower of the Cathedral of Our Lady gleefully said: "Oh, what a cute little church
It's only the highest building in the city, but she decided it was cute
> [Belgium is a beautiful city]
And while he's probably the most famous American to have said that, he's certainly not the only one I personally overheard saying that here
Was about to say that, like Iran and Syria were pretty modern
I like to point that out to racist people xp
Ah no the trans agenda uncovered
Yes it is I the transiest fry jumping out of your sunscreen
In Flanders it's also often played around Christmas
I've seen it a few times already
Seriously, that's a thing
That would sound so awkward to me
"Bonjour, Monsieur
-- Bonjour, comment puis-je vous aider ?
*ignoring whatever he just said*
-- I would like to order a coffee please"
Much less liberal than in the USA it seems, but still fair IMO
You can use deadly force to defend your or your loved ones' physical integrity
Only physical, you cannot attack or kill someone for trespassing, stealing or armed robbery
The danger to your physical integrity must be immediate, so in the process of happening or just about to happen
You can't shoot someone who's running away in the back
The thing is, because say, a person breaking in knows there are likely no guns anywhere
the person isn't going to bother with one
Just showing up is going to make them run because they don't want to be seen
Neighbors(butchery) got broken into, our back fence got forced open, etc
over recent years
The backdoor is still often open at night
I just don't fear burglars because they're after my stuff only and that's a nuisance, not a danger
By law it's just a case of "if your life is in danger do what you need to do to stay safe" with the caveat that if you can escape you fucking do so
If you're at your front door and you decide to to go and attack a burglar in your kitchen at the backdoor you're a moron
Shockingly human life here is valued over property damage
Something many Americans don't seem to grasp
You can also only use proportional force and this is very strict
If a knife is pulled on you you can't shoot him even if you have a legal firearm
As you said, when someone breaks in you can almost not harm that person since material belongings are less important than physical integrity (of yourself and the robber even) as long as he isn't threatening you physically
I doubt the court would accept shooting a fleeing suspect just because he stole your car as self-defence, basically anywhere
But IANAL either
I'm more likely to die in a car crash than to ever be in that situation so sorry for not exactly giving a shit
fair enough my dude, could do with some nicer language tough
I think there is just the local police for your arrondissement and the federal police for bigger matters
The Rijkswacht which is the same thing as Gendarmerie was reformed as a branch of the federal police a few decades ago because of internal issues
And for those curious about the "internal issues" that triggered this, it happened because the police and gendarmerie were competing rather than fully collaborating
This took a sour turn when Marc Dutroux kidnapped children
The gendarmerie suspected Dutroux but decided to do their own parallel inquiry rather than inform the judge
They fucked up big time, didn't find the two 8y/o girls hidden in a house they searched under a false pretense, and the girls later died of starvation
This blew up big and got us the reformed police
Not enough punishment for the involved gendarmes, if you ask me
Yes I know but there's a difference between military police and militarized police
Also, military police are sometimes seen escorting military transport
In that case, you have to listen to them same as civilian police
(For example telling you to stop, move aside, ...)
We don't use the noun 'boekstaaf' in Dutch anymore AFAI, but the verb 'boekstaven' still is
It's a very formal/literary synonym of "writing something down".
Well yes, because "Van den vos Reynaerde" was a direct translation of a French text called "le roman de Renart". It's even mentioned in the first paragraph of the Dutch poem, which was written down by a certain 'Willem' in the county of Flanders, back then the economic and cultural hub of the Low Countries:
>*Willem, die Madocke maecte,*
>*Daer hi dicken omme waecte,*
>*Hem vernoyde so haerde*
>*Dat die avonture van Reynaerde*
>*In dietsche onghemaket bleven*
"Willem, who made 'Madocke' (we don't really know what it means)
lay frequently awake at night,
he really regretted,
that the adventures/stories of Reynaerde,
were never written down in Dutch
" ("Dietsch" is an old word for "Nederlands")
>*Dat hi die vijte van Reynaerde dede soucken*
>*Ende hise na den walschen boucken*
>*In dietsche dus hevet begonnen
"He made \[people\] look for the holy life of Reynaerde
and according to the French books
(litt
"Walloon", but back then Walloon was almost a synonym for French
It originally meant foreigner, someone who doesn't the speak the common Germanic tongue
See 'Wales' or 'Wallachia')
he started it in Dutch
But in Dutch it's also 'adder' though
Figured as much
"een nadder" and "een adder" basically sound the same
I don’t get it, it’s not because the US is 300 years old that there’s only 300 years of history
Belgium is almost 200 years old but hell, our history classes start in the year 3500 BC
In the first year of high school, we learn about the prehistory
Second year: Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt
Third year: ‘early’ medieval times (500-1000)
Fourth year: ‘late’ medieval times (1000-1500)
Fifth year: ‘new times’ (1500-1830)
Sixth year: Belgian independence, world wars, cold war
Belgium is very much an artificial state and wasn't independent until 1830
We basically start by mentioning Gaul and its conquest by Caesar in the first century BC
Then there's a big gap where we focus on other more important empires in Europe and around 1700 we shift back to the low countries again
We get a quick run down at age 12 and further brake it down until age 18 with one age (exmp medieval age) a year
Simplify and skip a lot of portions that didn't really have an impact
By heart, I know we went over Leopold II, Franco, Robespierre, Louis XIV, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Lenin, Alexander The Great, Charlemagne, Tsar Nicholas and Rasputin, Napoleon, etc
We skip a lot my history teacher skipped the crusades and a lot of the cold war
Well, we don't really focus on Belgium, as it only started to exist in 1830
From 13yo to 18yo we focus on:
Year 1: early hominids to the first civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt
(Sorry India and China
Year 2: Indo Europeans migrating to different places in Europe, then Greek city states, Hellenist culture, Alexander the Great, the most important story beats of the Roman Empire up to the fall of the Western part
Year 3:Everything Middle Ages in our neighhborhood
The germanic tribes, gavelkind succession, the Karlings Merovingians, spread of Catholicism, farming practices, feudalism, the rise of cities
The crusades
Diseases
Year 4: New era
starts with the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire
Renaissance (buildings, paintings, sculptures
Luther and the Protestants
Reconquista
Exploration and colonisation
Inquisition
Some wars
Baroque ( recognize differences to Renaissance)
Year 5: enlightenment: philosophies
Nationalism More colonization
French revolution + Napoleanic wars
Belgium
Italy
Germany Industrial revolution
More Belgian politics
Marx
WW1
Year 6: interbellum WW2
Cold war (proxy wars)
Basically all major conflicts with the geopolitics behind it, some of which are still relevant today
And then some internal Belgian politics finally explaining wtf happened that we ended up this way
Fall of the USSR
Balkans
Iraq (the first time) 9/11 and the consequences it had
And then briefly on some conflicts that are still relevant (That was in 2015)
So tldr: everything necessary to understand current Belgian politics and current world conflicts
Belgium over 6 years
7th grade: Prehistory, Egypt(early, middle, late)
8th grade: the ancients, So Greece and Rome
9th grade: Post-Rome
Mainly focussed on the normal people
10th grade: Feudalism, France, England
11th grade: Napoleon + WW1
12th grade: WW2
And in between we cover the Aztecs and all that as 1 or 2 lessons
1st year of high school: we learned about everything that has to do with humans untill about 800 BC (Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia)
2nd year: 800 BC untill the fall of the Western Roman Empire (476 AD) We first learned about the Greeks, then about the Romans (and a little bit about the Celts)
3rd year: Middle Ages (476-1453) Charlemagne, christianity, (fall of) Byzantine Empire, Habsburg Netherlands, France and a ton of culture
4rd year: (1453-1750) mainly colonisation of America
Dutch Revolt, The Enlighment, humanism, and again a ton of culture (renaissance
5th year: (1750-1939) American and French revolution, South American Revolutions, colonisation of Africa, WW1, Unification of Germany and Italy, Belgian Revolution, Russia and the formation of the USSR, Interbellum
6th year (I'm currently in the 6th year): WW2, Cold War (and Vietnamese and Korean War), and then probably decolonisation of Africa and the fall of communism
*why do i see that many germans ?*
Wouldn’t happen for Belgium, they barely have power here
And on top of that the title of King is not even tied to the land in Belgium
His title is literally King of the Belgians, not King of Belgium, so his title isn't even historically tied to territorial claims
You start university at 17-18 years :
We have 12 school years, 6 of primary school, 6 of secondary school
You start primary school when you are 5-6, you end secondary school when you are 17-18
Do school years last 13 years in these other countries
Or manybe the explanation is that they start school later, such as 7 instead of 5-6
Yes, "only" 12 years
For Belgium, it is 6 of primary school, then 6 of secondary school (no such thing such as middle and high school here)
Secondary school is divided in two cycles : lower/inferior secondary school (years 1-2-3), and higher/superior secondary school (years 4-5-6)
The only difference between the two, is that the later has classes given by people with a university's master degree who had a postgraduate training to teach, while the teachers in the lower/inferior cycle went to a teaching high-school (high-school in Belgium is : a higher education school that gives your professionnal bachelor degrees; it's an alternative to universities (universities giving academic degrees))
I have no idea what "A-levels" are supposed to be
Hogeschool in English is college
No, it isn't. College doesn't even mean the same thing in the UK or the US
"College" isn't a word that fits Belgian education system
In our country, a college is a Catholic primary/secondary school, and high-school is vocational higher education
Hogeschool and American college are more or less equivalent, since they are both institutes of tertiary education that are not universities
So that's how I explain professionally what a hogeschool is to foreigners who are not familiar with the Flemish education system and it works quite well
The fact that some secondary schools have the title of college doesn't really matter
>or make illegal referendums
Imo that's kind of stupid to call these 'illegal'. The Spanish government will likely never give Catalonia a referendum, so it'll always be illegal
The flair cuts of at "since" on my phone and RiF so you're right to include it in your comment
>And in the day vote all anti independence citizens didn't vote because it was not considered a real one
So the results were heavily biased
Yeah I know and I don't consider the results legit either
I just think that Spain will never allow a referendum
Does not necessarely work
The states in Germany never had a very strong independence movement
The states in Belgium keep getting more seperated and more and more people want independence even though we have a lot of autonomy
I live in Antwerp (Antwerpen in Dutch),  which according to the myth  was named after a soldier who killed a giant,  and threw the giant's hand in the river ( throwing a hand = 'hand werpen',  which sounds a lot like 'Antwerpen')
I've heard other explanations too,  but those arent as interesting :P
[Here] is the story
"kortenberg" (short mountain)
...it's on a slight hill
additionally "Meerbeek" (LakeCreek)
..it has a lake, and some creeks
I live in Hoboken, district of Antwerp and thus the original Hoboken (looking at the US here)
Anyway, the name comes from 'Hoge Beuken' (English: high [beeches] which are trees that are really common here and can be quite tall
However, I prefer the version where a mayor dropped his "[boterham] and yelled "oh boke
". (We often call a 'boterham' a 'boke' near Antwerp
My city is called Louvain-la-Neuve, so literally "Leuven the new" in French
This is because in the 70s, French-speaking students were kicked out of the Leuven university (located in the Flemish speaking part of Belgium) so they decided to build the same university but in the French speaking part of our country
Around the university they built houses and shops and now it's a fully functional city with a lot of students
Turnhout
I was told it comes from the old germanic words "durnum" and "hulta" meaning thorn and wood/forest
So it means thorny forest
Another explanation is that "Turn" is another word for tower
So it means tower in the woods
My city in Belgium is called Oostende (~ East-end)
We used to be an island just in front of the shore
So as we were on the East-end of that island, there was also a city on the West-end (called Westende)
And on top of that there was a church in the middle between the 2 cities,  Middle-Church (called Middelkerke)
Throughout the years they started to fill up the space between shore and our land, which resulted in Oostende becoming the city at the beach
I've learned the story this way but could never back it up with results online
So yeah
I live in a small village called Zedelgem, formarly in our dialect known as Zilleghem
It has two parts 'Zedel/Zille' comes from one of the many medieval words for swamp 'zele' and the second part 'gem/ghem' is widely used throughout germanic speaking countries (like 'heim' in germany) for a place where people live together
Well there was Village A, it was ideally suited for trade and was called Turnhout, but it belonged to a knightly order so people had to pay extra tax for that which people didn't like
So in comes village B, that's "free" and right next to it so all trade goes through there
Then they had to find a name so they named themselves Turnhout to make it easier for traders
And eventually turns into s city
But wait
Village A is also called Turnhout, so what's with that
Well
Now it's called Oud-Turnhout (old Turnhout)
Turnhout comes from the Germanic turn or torn (torn trees) and hout comes from forest
This was actually very interesting to find out, thanks for the question
My town is called Ieper, which is derived from the small river it was built on, the Ieperlee
The Ieperlee takes its name from old Dutch where it means something like stream bordered by Iepen (a type of tree)
Ravels, it comes from Ravenbos which means something like Ravenwood
The area around here used to be popular hunting grounds for nobles a long time ago and the next town has its name from eagles
Falconing was a big thing here and you can still do it im a few places
My town is called 'Kortrijk' and at first sight it looks like it's a compound of the Dutch words 'kort' (short) and 'rijk' (realm)
There's a folktale about how a young man was offered a plot of land by his liege lord to found a new town, but only under one condition: the boundaries of this new town would be determined by how far the young man's horse could run continuously without stopping
The horse, however, was quite old and tired and after only a short while the horse slowed down, collapsed on the ground and died of exhaustion
And that's how the young man's realm was quite short
The real etymology is not as exciting, but still interesting
It goes back to the Gallo-Roman word 'Cortoriacum', but the exact meaning is unknown
There are also a few other towns nearby with names of Gallo-Roman origin like Wervik (Viroviacum) and Doornik/Tournai (Tornacum), which is quite exceptional, since almost all other town and village names in the area are of Germanic origin
Using the city I was born instead of live
It's now named Eeklo but used to be called eikenlo
"Eik" is dutch for "oak".
Basically we had a lot of oaks and it became a rather wealthy town because of it's location, a day's travel away from Ghent and Brugge
The city's name in Dutch is Keulen (pronounced as 'Köhlen' in German), so you can see where it branched off from the High German version
For people who want the boring story: Antwerp is right next to the river Scheldt and as it happens to be right next to a big curve in said river
In such a curve of a big river lots of silt gets pushed into that curve
In old Dutch they thus called it "aenwerp", wich is what they called the naturaly raised ground that was "thrown" (worpen/werpen) there by the river
'Antwerpen' thus comes from 'aenwerpen' where the first setlements of the city came to be, near the "aangeworpen grond" (thrown in ground)
The original 'aenwerpen' were near the small castle called " 't Steen" but have been gone since the end of the 19th century, when we build the warfs at 't Scheldt
Dude that's hilarious lmfao
>s‑Gravenhage (known as The Hague in English)
First time I heard that name as a Belgian
We just say 'Den Haag'.
Interesting story though
Milan is pig city,  aight I'll remember that :P
Turn it around and you get Leuven
Hoboken New Jersey, iirc
I didn't went into details but further down the tread I started [I already mentioned that]
Thanks for the more thorough explanation though
It is still interesting
shit, you're right
this is splendid trivia
Yeah I looked it up
It had a really similar name but then flemish people emmigrated to there and renamed it to Hoboken
They "ronronnent", so it's *ron-ron*. (with French pronunciation of "on")
There are 3 languages in my country, but the Flemish AKA Dutch speaking people tend to say 'miauw'. The verb would be 'miauwen'.
I'm not sure if it's dialect though
The public universities: Brussel, Gent, Leuven, Hasselt, Antwerpen, Louvain-La-Neuve, Liège, Namur
Edit: and Mons and maybe another one that I forgot
The royal military academy
The University of Leuven
It's one of the oldest in the world
I can't tell you, why it is the best but I have a little fun fact about it
Maybe some of you know, that Belgium is divided by the language conflict between Walloons and Flanders
Or much simpler: the frenchspeaking part and the dutchspeaking part
Because of its location in Flanders that's about 30-50 km away from Wallonia, there where a lot of Frenchspeakers
In the 20th century the Walloons were thrown out and dislocated in the South
A new frenchspeaking City (Louvain-La-Neuve) was build including a new University
But here comes the crazy part: As the new University had no books, the library of Leuven was split in half
So for example: Leuven gets the books that start with "A", L-L-N gets the books that start with "B", and so on
I think that's one of the craziest stories in the history of the Wallonia-Flanders conflict
uGent and KU Leuven are both in the list of top 100 best universities in the world
Don't forget Mons
De kludde, he lives in Wichelen
He basically eats humans
There are Frogmen near where my parent live :
["Nekker" or "Nikker" in Flemish
Distances
I used to think Los Angeles and San Francisco were pretty much neighbouring cities the way people in movies talk how they're close together, but according to google it's a 6 hour drive
&#x200B;
To put that in perspective
You can drive from Bruges (at the North Sea coast, inbefore  Zeebruges) to Arlon (in the most Southern part near the Luxembourg border) in half that time
I wonder how other European people from larger countries experience that, because Paris-Marseille is even further apart
(**7 h 52 min** (776
3 km) via A6 and A7) or Bilbao - Malaga ( **8 h 41 min** (920
3 km) via A-4 )
&#x200B;
But I guess that's nothing compared to Oslo - Tromso :o
&#x200B;
Or Kalingrad - Vladivostok
Must be fun for football fans, because Baltika Kaliningrad and FC Luch Vladivostoka are in the same league :o
Same where would you be able to drive like that here
Belgians would just start talking to you in English, as soon as they notice you are a foreigner
I'm not sure if asking for the standard dialect would work out here, as many people who speak a regional dialect are rather convinced they actually speak the standard dialect
No dialect in French, everybody speaks a local variation of standard French
So, there is no "switching of dialect" possible
One European traffic system with the use of symbols instead of language
Once abroad, many people don't understand what traffic signs displays
A degree (secondary school -> university)
In Belgium the traffic rules aren't even the same for the whole country
On the 'gewest'roads, you can drive up to 70km/h in Flanders but 90km/h in Wallonia and Brussels
It's especially annoying for tourist, because why would there be different traffic rules in the same country
I'm fine with text as long as it's non-critical
Like a symbol sign telling you access denied - and the sub-sign reads in text "except for cyclists
If you don't know how to read the text as a cyclist, you can still fall back on the regular sign and find a way around like car drivers do
You won't be able to take the shortcut, but you're not directly endangering yourself by taking another way either
Yes, and that's not my point
My point is that **I** would support that a degree (not *any* degree) for a specific study in country A should have the same value as that degree in country B. And I'm not specifically talking about university degrees, but degrees from secondary school degrees to university master degrees
Maybe that's for the best haha
It's not like we have one too
It's fine, though I don't know what the end mean (also I may try to make the poffertjes at home)
Curryworst or frikandel
The "Curryworst" vs ["Frikandel"] (the actual correct name) vs "Lange Hamburger"  and the ["Frikadel"] (the correct one) vs "Frika**n**del" (just wrong) vs "Boulet" (acceptable) vs "Gehaktbal (meatballs)" (a general term, also correct) problem
Because the camps are mostly regional divided, conflict remains minimal
But ordering in a fritterie in region you're not from can lead to a lot of confusion
French speaking part VS Dutch speaking part
I don't think anyone beats that
The Flemish Belgian "rock paper scissor" divide
[So you have folks who say "blad steen schaar" (green: leaf rock scissor) and you have people who say it as god intended: Schaar steen papier (orange: scissor stone paper)
While the greens are bigger in area, orange is the most densely populated part of Belgium including the biggest cities and orange also has the big advantage of being correct
I'm still not sure if there are actually people who like raisins
Surely, they must exist, since we can find such things in stores, but I don't recall ever meeting one
^(I actually prefer the raisin buns
I have a French Canadian friend
She's disgusting
She keeps saying the c-word
In some places in Belgium, it's "couque au chocolat".
Patat
PATAT
It's FRIET
If you have 2 of the 4 main ingredients of mayonnaise, why not just make mayonnaise
Buy an egg, buy some moustard
of lange hamburger
I've never heard anyone call it curryworst, that must be a Flemish thing
I would say: Fricandelle or Fricadelle
Frikadellekes are meatballs, the long meatstick is ne currywust
The meatball from the frituur is een boulèt.
I do
It's "friet". Ne patat is something you pull out the ground
Both words refer to the same thing
However, people call it differently in parts of the country
The debate is about which one is the right word for the snack
Yeah it's mainly a Flemish thing
Fricandelle is a meatball to me, or at least the bastardized dialect word frikadel / frikadelle(kes)
We say that as dialect for ice cream around these parts tho
> I think couque is belge
It is, but not even from everywhere in Belgium
Only in Brussels and in Hainaut
In Namur, Liège or Luxembourg it is pain au chocolat
Niet in België. Vreemd hoe het onderscheid zo duidelijk is in België en zo 'controversieel' in Nederland
(Geen steek naar Nederland bedoeld, gewoon een vaststelling)
Hold on now
As a Belgian it is my god-given right to have a voice in anything fry-related
That and waffles

Wow, that's harsh

Ireland
I've been visiting there with my mum every year for ten years, except last year of course
I love it there
Beautiful nature and coastline, cosy towns, friendly people, yummy food, all the music on the street
Their accent sounds so cool too and I wish I could talk like that
I'd love to just go live there to be honest
Could you link some of that Czech music
I'm trying to create a playlist full of European music and any help is welcome haha (others are of course also welcome to chime in)
The Netherlands
Everyone is so happy over there
(Well, except when they are not) I have never found a country that just clicks with me as well as the Netherlands
I can't learn the language because it is already my mother tongue
However I also love the Swedish language so I am learning that
Switzerland (german part), I just love the Alps, the language, the houses
I just want to live in the mountains, have some animals and do some gardening
Same here
I also only visited it twice but those were the best vacations ever
Such a beautiful place
The UK is a very overhyped country
I don't know why so many are in love with it to the point where it can only let you down
You're half/half
That's a combo I have never imagined, but sounds so cool
I know some Poles and it's hard to imagine my image of Poles and Mexicans combined
So you're chill (my idea of Mexican) but also complain a lot (all the Poles I know)
Awesome thanks
I can send it to you already if you want, it's sort of an eternal work in progress haha
I'm pretty ambitious with it
Right now I'm at about 1400 songs but it's still waaaay too focussed on western Europe for my liking
So if you'd ever feel like overloading me with a whole bunch more, well known or less well known, I definitely won't say no :)
The end-idea is to make something that celebrates the musical diversity of Europe as well as just European music in general so anything is welcome really
See it as the sound of a continent all rolled into one list
Haha cool
My son is half Belgian, half Taiwanese, also not a usual mix I think
That is also a thing in Belgium and Spain, AFAIK
(with the exception of football)

Okay but Switzerland isn't in the EU, so I understand that
But even then, I didn't have any border control driving into Switzerland coming from France
Yeah
I used a list of all the languages I found on the net
Meh :) I think it's natural people want to correct it
As long as they don't act like dicks, as they don't, I'm okay with it

That's a good point

Yes, and it's the reason for the "ye Olde ...shop" trope
The "y" is actually the letter thorne and is pronounced "th"

In Dutch we have neither so not 100% familiar with the use :)
Filip Dewinter
Organised a 'Islam safari' though muslim neighbourhoods
That's Belgian extreme right for you
Also Leon Degrelle who was a collabo who was at some point considered as the nephew of hitler
He escaped in Spain after the war and remained there till his death
We didn't want him back
Alive or dead
A lot of Flemish people love Dewinter though
Yeah, the closed minded xenophobic muslim haters do
Not exactly a politician I would argue
Don't know, for me politicians kind of implies being voted or elected in some way, though that seems a bit of a narrow view by me
What about Sarkozy
Didn't he fall completely out of grace after the 2012 election
With all the scandals, all the corruption that was exposed
Still, I think the king back then was much more involved in poltics than today
He's somewhere in between
But still, what he did was horrible, and 10 million Congolese people died during the Belgian supremacy
Leopold II was pretty much one of the reasons todays Kings are not able to be as involved in politics, though the biggest reason remains Leopold III
In Flanders it depends where u are
There has been multiple polls and even a map in r/Belgium that shows where people say what for "rock paper scizzors". And the comment section became somewhat hostile between people who used a different version
To put it simply, these are the 3 main ones used
Blad Steen Schaar (Paper/Leaf Rock Scizzors): used by the most people
Schaar Steen Papier (Scizzors Rock Paper): used mostly by people from Antwerpen Province and Vlaams-Brabant Province
Steen Papier Schaar (Rock Paper Scizzors): used by people who live very close to Dutch borders, so probably mostly the Province Limburg
we just use the standard, but in east flanders we say paper, rock, paper scissors, instead of rock paper scissors
Yeah same here
Do you call it steen papier schaar
I've always called it schaar steen papier and I've heard it being called blad steen schaar, but never another order
This whole thread hurt my brain lmao
Blad might be better translated to 'sheet' in this case
A "blad papier" is a "sheet of paper".
I always thought it was "blad steen schaar" in Flemish and "schaar steen papier" in Dutch Dutch
Good question, we don't even know why lol, btw if u scroll up there is a comment where Dutchies and Belgians are discussing the differences as well as a map with the regions where they use what version lol
We just have a lot of dialects and languages
The flemish region alone has: Limburgish (classified as a seperate language outside of Belgium), West-flemish (also classified as a seperate language outside of Belgium), East-Flemish and Brabantian
And many cities have there own regional variants
Antwerp has the Antwerp dialect which is a version of Brabantian but totally different from someone from Vlaams-Brabant
Aalst lies in Oost-Vlaanderen but its dialect leans more to Brabantian than East-Flemish
And many many more examples akd  the same goes for the Walloon region
And you think steen papier schaar sounds good
It's as bad as saying patat to frieten
[A map of the naming of the game]
Only Brabant-related dialects/regions use (the superior) Schaar-steen-papier
Both schaar steen papier and steen papier schaar sound so ugly to my ears, and unnatural, blad steen schaar FTW
Steen papier schaar sounds terrible
> blad steen papier
It's blad steen schaar
The "blad" in that version is "a page" of paper
According to this map I live in the blad steen schaar area but I say schaar steen papier
But I live just outside the schaar steen papier area
In Flemish I've always played schaar steen papier, bur in French we play it Pierre papier ssizoo
That's where you're wrong
Well, it only shows where one is a majority over the other
Same, but the opposite
Patat is plural WHAT
Yeah
I heard schaar steen papier way more but that might've been different at other schools in my city
Weird probably in the Netherlands it is only used like that, we really do say Frieten or Patatten as plural
I’m sorry but that’s wrong on so many levels to me ahahah
You can't compare the per-person cost of a family of four to a single person, it's a lot cheaper to cook for four (per person) than for one

I'd know where I want to live in this overgeneralised world of US conservatives
If you have a (semi)permanent residence, which means you're paying taxes, yes, I think you should get a vote on how your taxes are being spent
I'm not sure this is practically feasible however, since the voting systems differ from country to country
Here in Belgium for example you have compulsory voting, and as far as I know doesn't really have a registration system
I think that if you lived here for a long enough time (say 5 years so you can also apply for citizenship) you should be able to vote, but only if you show that you are commited to the country you live in by at least showing you want citizenship
So assume you can only apply for citizenship if you are in said country for over 5 years, have a place stay, have a job with at least a  minimum wage and speak one of the official languages
I think you should be able to vote if you are in the country long enough, 2 out of the 3 other requirements are met and have proof that you are working on the 3rd
On the other hand, I don't think that you should still be able to vote in a country that you don't live in
(I that's why Turkey still has Erdoğan and partially why Hungary has Orbán.)  If you return to a country I think you should again live there for 5 years (or less depending on how long ypu were gone) before you should be able to vote
Same in Belgium
My grandfather has been living in Belgium for more than 90 years but he has ever just voted for the communes since he has the citizenship from Luxembourg
In the latter part you make it sound like it wasn't even that bad

I flew to Madrid from Belgium last week
Didn't ever need to show my ID to get to the gate, and on arrival I never had to show my ID either
This was for both ways
Ticket with a Shengen destination was all the documentation that was needed to get to where I wanted to be
There is no slow down, there are no controls or roadblocks and it doesn't affect me
It's probably like going from one city to another in other countries
The only thing that might affect me is that other countries use a different language, different signs and different traffic rules
No slow downs, no controls
Just a sign next to the road that says *welcome in [country]*. If you’re from the USA: it’s the same like crossing the border of 2 states
I often end up in the Netherlands on accident when I go biking with my family in the weekends
As a passenger in a car and not looking out the first sign tend to be a message on the phone welcoming you
Easy as hell
Only rarely will you be checked when crossing a border in the Schengen area
It's crazy that in 100 years we went from having to be stopped by world powers from invading each other, we went to establishing the Benelux and all that came with it
Belgium is right in between France, the UK and Germany and therefor gets a lot of trucks from all over Europe all going trough our small country
Some stick to the main highways that are made to endure heavy loads, others don't give a shit where they go and constantly wreck our smaller roads
Therefor a large part of the buget goes to making repairs that could have been avoided and other roads that are also in desperate nead of replacement pay the cost
Also the fact that our government doesn't know how to handle money
I stopped getting these a couple of years ago
Do you still get them then
It varies from airline to airline, (or maybe destination), but in theory you shouldn't have to show your ID at any time when travelling inbetween Schengen airports
In practice sometimes they still ask it upon boarding to verify that you are the owner of the ticket, but I've had flights where I never had to take my ID out
As for the UK, their rules don't really apply, since the UK was never Schengen
Nope
Brussels -> Barcelona and back here for a fair for work
Could have left any identification at home technically
(still had my ID and driver's license with me of course)
By law any identification would suffice, not just your ID, but in practise I wouldn't try annoying the staff
Yeah as I said in the last part of my comment: the government doesn't really know how to spend money
Long text messages or text messages with images count as MMSs
I end up sending some every now and then
In the past when we still got them it was super annoying
We lived really close to the border so we got them just by moving within our home
You were correct
Because of the amount of traffic, national and international, Belgian roads not only wear down faster, but we have a lot more of them than other countries, despite being smaller
This means we can afford less money per road
That's why even the less busy roads are usually in poor shape
I'm sceptical Dutch administration would be able to make much of a difference
Right we indeed do have an insane amount of roads compared to other countries
Didn't even think about that part yet

Maybe we should split, but are neither Dutch or French

These are regions where they speak these languages
Just because the name of the language refers to a nationality doesn't mean they are solely spoken by that nationality
These languages originate from Belgium just as much as they do from France and the Netherlands
On a federal level we are once again stuck in long drawn out formation period
However the trains will keep riding, schools will remain open and every government institution will keep running
The impasse will have zero impact on everyday life
You have to keep in mind though that a lot of Belgians commenting have their own political perspective
The country is in many ways split
The fissure runs along the language border
Many on the Flemish side and some on the Walloon side want a permanent separation and some of them will insist the country is not working at all and is run worse than a banana republic
This in my opinion is an exaggeration used only to score political points
I don't see the country splitting any time soon though
As Flemish and Walloon tend to ignore the elephant in the room called Brussels
Still 1,3 million people in a country of 11 million
Next to the port of Antwerp, Brussels is also one of economic heavyweights of Belgium

These are group names for the dialects of Dutch and French spoken in these regions
There is no such thing as Flemish, each village has their own dialect

I don't understand West-Flemish either
I'm just making up for the Brits Leaving the EU

And Dutch people are everywhere
I saw more Dutch than French people in France

(Both make up Belgium)
In Wallonia, we make jokes about French people being arrogant/disdainful/haughty
We joke a lot aboit the Netherlands
Love you Netherlands
Ah yes, make jokes about the Belgians who speak French to you French people while you respond in your "perfect" English :)
That's awfully ironic in a historic sense
That's awfully ironic in a historic sense
To be fair even we laugh with the state of our roads
>flemish
you're a bit early to call us a country
*in italian accent* How can-a you not make-a jokes about you
We can be with you too <3
I haven't heard it anywhere else, but my family's circle call them "Tarzan roads" cause they let you make Tarzan's yell/roar(?)
It disgusting how people could even joke about that
Who says that we copied you and not the other way around
Maybe in futur who can tell
Cette réponse ne fait que confirmer que nos blagues sont peut-être plus proches de la réalité que l'on ne pourrait le croire ; )
I will make it legal
I've hidden him someplace nobody would ever dare to go seek him (In Antwerp)
The plane commander said « the plane is too heavy throws things »
Then the Turk throwed Kebab, cuz there is too much kebab in his country
Then the Belgian throwed « French » Fries cuz there was too much of these in Belgium
Then, that’s the joke everyone maked in my 12 years of school,it’s not my joke,and i’m not saying it’s true
The Dutch throwed the Turk, because there was too much Turks in his country
Plz it’s not my joke don’t kill me
>I don't remember any jokes about Turkish stereotypes or the country of Turkey, though
Why should you never run over a Turk on a bike with your car
Could be your bike
An American a French and a Turk are in a plane
The American put his hand out of the plane and tell the 2 other passengers that they are in America
The French and the Turk ask him how he know and the American say that he touched the Liberty Statue
The French does the same and tell them they are in France
The other ask him how he know and he say that he touched the Eiffel tower
Then the Turk stick his hand out of the plane and proudly say that they are in Turkey
The other ask him how he know and he tell them that someone stole his watch
Don't worry the Luxembourgish province like you the most
Luxembourg will always be our favorite brother don't worry
They could have copied too
A government
What's that
Why would we copy what France claims is their stereotype for us *for you*?
Bruh this is inaccurate
We did 500 days once, honour us god damn it
Why can’t it be NL that wants to throw it back at us
Or the French that throw it back at us
Your arguments make no sense
Not to worry, we're currently working on it again ^^
The French don’t joke about NL
I meant they want to throw back a stereotype we directed at them to us
I don’t understand what you were trying to say there, but doesn’t mind
I’m trying to say that there’s no way to know who started with the jokes
Go ahead and research it, then
Nah I have better things to spend my time on
I was not, I’m saying that you cannot just know who was first
The Netherlands wasn’t always the richest of the two, so that doesn’t prove a lot
Maybe joking about NL has been a way for Belgians to distant themselves more and more from NL
So moral of the story: as I’ve said the entire time: we don’t know who was first and will probably never know
True, but that doesn’t make us know who was first
The Belgians wanted independence so they could perfectly have started it too according to this fact you gave here
I didn’t find anything about the jokes on the internet, so nope: we still don’t know
What the fuck is a meertens Instituut even
We probably have, I just couldn’t care less about it
It's 18
9°C but I would prefer it more around 20-21°C.
I'm too lazy to get out of the couch to start the heating and once I'll put it on, I'll have to get out of the couch in 5-10min to turn it off again because it heats up a bit too quickly
On top of that I'm going to bed in half an hour (or at least that's what I tell myself, reality might turn out very differently) so I feel like starting to heat the living room right now is a bit of a waste
Yup same in Belgium everyone wears their jacket in class
I’ve never heard of such laws
Seems awfully controlling by the govt
I would call yours super duper cold too :p
Thanks for your reply
Interesting they didn't let go of the law once the scarcity had diminished
Here, we had car free Sundays to conserve oil, but they were reduced significantly over time as more oil became available again
Now we only have one car free Sunday a year iirc, more out of nostagia than anything else
And then we get to bike and skate in what are normally really busy streets, so that's fun too
They had a referendum once or I think maybe even twice, but the people voted no
Norway is doing good without the EU and they would have to make quite a lot of changes in their laws to join, so I can see why they don’t want to
The EU and Norway also have a very good relationship, so there are benefits for both Norway and EU-countries without Norway being part of the EU

Totally off topic but prut in Dutch means dirty mush
City of 35k. I feel completely safe but I wouldn't leave my house/car/bike unlocked
I doubt something would happen but you never know
Volcanoes while erupting
We don't really have one but the saxophone was invented by a Belgian, [Adolphe Sax]
The only instrument close to that would be the saxophone, since a belgian invented it
He stood on our 200 frank(€5) bill I think it was
The Bressingham Voigt barrel organ, now stationed in Gamerwolde (near Groningen) is probably the most well known in the entire world, especially to early 2000’s gamers
Who could forget about tracks such as Tales from the Vienna Woods, also known as “I want to go on something more exciting than Merry go-round 1,” played on the Groningen‘s organ
It's literally blasting sound from a giant machine in the middle of a city asking for money so yeah I'd call it extortion
Cruel bastards
Small town between Ghent and Brugge and around the same time some emperor was born several hundred years ago
(forgot who but he was a big deal) Our town bought A LOT of fireworks
As a result it's believed he was born there
Other than that it's a peaceful town so not a whole lot
So annoying when people don’t put the city name
Where is “here”???
I would say the founding and building/construction of a whole new city/town out of nothing on its muncipal territory in the 70's : Louvain-la-Neuve, part of the city and municipality of Ottignies
Last time it happened in what is now Belgium was in 1666, with Charleroi
It happened because far-righters and far-right youth movements from Dutch-speaking Belgium expelled the French-speakers from Leuven and its university, an event known as the "*Walen Buiten*". So, the French-speaking teachers and students of said university had no place to teach and study anymore, and it was decided that a new city would be built to host them, the university's building and the campus
I know it's commonplace in francophone Belgium to continuously depict anything that's related to the Flemish movement and Flemish nationalism as far-right, but the fact remains that without it Dutch (or its dialects) would never have been made an official language in Belgium nor have remained the majority language in Flanders
They had to fight tooth and nail for every piece of language legislation, because the French speaking bourgeoisie were not doing it out of goodness of their own heart
I wish Leuven Vlaams/Walen buiten could have been approached more gracefully, but it seems to me that francophones don't understand why it happened in the first place or think the Flemish were just being difficult
The language border had just been made official a few years prior, something many French speakers didn't accept for a long time, and Leuven was part of the Dutch speaking area
However, there was still a large section of the University of Leuven that was French speaking and a lot of Dutch speakers (rightly) feared that Leuven would become majority French speaking like Brussels
Many francophones never took these fears seriously and some of them even ridiculed them (e.g. Université de Houte-si-Plou)
When later plans were announced to expand the French section in Leuven and to create a sort of corridor between Leuven and Brussels, tensions came to a boiling point and Leuven Vlaams/Walen buiten was the sad result of that
It's important that francophones realise that they weren't just the defenseless victims in this whole debacle
They enjoyed many privileges back then and when these were taken away, they felt attacked
There was never a Dutch speaking university in Wallonia and you can rest assured that they would have never allowed it
The UK has the Tolkien Estate , Belgium has Moulinsart, to handle, manage and protect the property and rights related to Tolkien and Hergé's (Tintin) works/opi
Does your country has a simular institution that has a monopoly on a writer's work which considered a national marvel/treasure
Hello people,
So, these two bodies/companies have near exclusive rights to the works of their respective writer
Meaning : they decide what can be published, who can do it, they handle the rights and copyrights related to what Tolkien or Hergé wrote
In summary, they have a kind of monopoly on their opi, and you can't do anything Tolkien or Tintin/Hergé related without their approval (may it be movies, books, t-shirts, mugs, toys etcs
I don't know for the Tolkien Estate, but Moulinsart is particularly aggressive in that regard
For example, an artist called *Un faux graphiste* ("a fake graphic designer"), who was posting on Facebook, had to shut down his page because his work consisted mostly of Tintin's strips and pages, in which he had modified the texts in the speech bubbles
His work was humourous, absurd reinterpretation of what happened in the strip or page
He made no money from it, got no profit
But Moulinsart did "attack" him legally, and he had to delete everything
So, does your country has something similar
Is there a major writer/literary work that is "protected" by a company/legal body that has a monopoly on it and controls what can or can't be done with it
Yeah, I mean specifically what he wrote and his world
Not about the creatures that aren't his inventions
The only onces I can think of right now are:
Room (meaning: cream)
Of (meaning: or)
Edit: this is in Dutch
In West Flemish (a Dutch dialect) we have these tshirts/sweaters with: “west flemish for behinners”.
They have sentences like:
“Awesome means breath”
“Hail means horny”
“Hot means god”
“Honey means don’t go”
“Dust means thirsty”
“Tit means time”
French:
pain = bread
demand = to ask, neutrally
con = idiot
bite = slang word for a dick (the male genitals)
&#x200B;
Dutch:
pet = a cap
lol = fun
Literally
"lol hebben" means to have fun
Go visit the Big Cities
There are nearly no locals left, so nearly impossible to annoy them
I'm in Poland right now, and I've been conflicted in whether I should tip, and how much, because the service is excellent but I don't want to come across as exactly like was described
I'm not currently in one, but my ex was Russian and I'm Belgian
Surprisingly, there were very few cultural differences
The biggest differences between us were class differences as she was rich and I'm rather poor
There was however one big cultural shock for her
We could walk in the street and hold hands and no one gave a fuck
In Russia, there's so much homophobia that she just couldn't do that with her ex, or at least not without getting harassed
Other than that, no big differences, or at least nothing I would consider to be cultural differences
Bidet
Three
That for birthdays
Well I don't really know, it was her experience as she told me
I wouldn't be able to ask her anymore, unfortunately
Maybe it was because her ex was butch, I don't know
All I know is she felt general hostility from the people she saw
I don't know who you are but generally, oppression is easier to see when you're the one being oppressed, maybe that's why you don't see it
(but idk)
Yeah, I'd say so
I'm sure other people may have different experiences, especially since I was only ever with her in big cities, but overall, I generally wouldn't be afraid
Maybe it's different for men, tho, I couldn't say
Really
We learned at school last year that a lot of schools in the UK are single sex

A true Communist
Here in Belgium you are allowed to switch lunch and dinner
belgium as well
one of the dishes is a sandwich and the other is the warm one
you can switch or do exception every now and then (no big deal) but that's how it usually works
That's also true for us
Probably a small house in my province (Brabant wallon), and either a very small house or a nice flat in Brussels region
But if I go elsewhere in French-speaking Belgium, I could buy a quite nice house with that money, if not a big house
Small Belgian village
You could afford a nice house, nothing extraordinary but reasonable big and nice
[Here's a link to an example] 3 bedrooms, 246 m², €395 000
It's a bit old but I just looked it up because I don't really have an idea(wealthy background)
[With all taxes and such it's going to cost you more than 400k but close enough
Bought 2 buildings for 500k+ a piece but they're still under construction
One is a decent sized apartment and the other is a home that's a lot smaller than the one here
So yea, a new house that's separate is going to cost you 500k easily
Really that expensive there
In Flanders, as long as you're not in or very close to Bruges, Ghent or Antwerp, you'd definitely get a nice newly built house for that money, size depending on location
Where I live it would definitely be a pretty nice one
Brabant and Brussels are very expensive yes
You can have a house for that price sure, but much smaller than what you would have in the rest of Wallonia with the same amount of money
I'm from Antwerp: generally you want to avoid most of the restaurants in the historical centre, especially those that hail you in and have pictures of foods etc, the usual thing
HOWEVER there are actually some very good restaurants there too with nice and cozy terraces / views, but they tend to be more hidden from sight and only known by locals
I think it's ok to check on Tripadvisor and google reviews
last I checked those they seemed accurate & honest
(even tho I know sometimes restaurants do scummy things in tripadvisor)
I consider pretty much entire Bruges to be a tourist trap
It's probably still worth going but as far as I know everything there in the centre is overpriced and catered to tourists
For entire belgium: avoid shops that loudly advertise 'belgian beers' or 'belgian chocolates', if you want either of those to take with you, you go to a specialty drinks store (like Drankgigant) for beers, or to a well reviewed bakery/chocolaterie for chocolates
Which is the street
That makes sense, I always thought of it as lovely ruling animal
Well if we're going on that route, a calf is someone who does stupid things ("stom kalf")
We pretty much all write in English, hell even r/belgium is pretty much entirely English
Rarely you'll get Dutch/French postst or comments
In /r/Belgium we usually posts translations of articles in anything non-english (Dutch/French/German) via deepl
com
The primary language is English so everyone can understand one another
But NL/FR/DE is always open
But you don't want to see the beautiful mess of language that is /r/BELGICA
/r/Belgium is mostly English because of the two language communities, although you see Dutch being used relatively often
Yes, dutch posts are so rare
r/BELGICA is peak belgian performance
Ok, that's awful
I never bothered to learn English(study it) but people were surprised I wasn't from Britain when I was talking over Ventrillo when I was 16 playing world of warcraft
I remember being 6 or so and having trouble playing pokemon yellow because of my lack of English though but back then I was only listening to dutch music of course
I had an American friend by the time I was 8 playing in the swimming pool in France
we also have r/wallonia that is in French and some time in Wallon
I love it
I genuinely love r/BELGICA
Yeah it's not common, but it's one of the official languages
They even have their own parliament and representation in the federal
But yeah it's a couple of villages, yet I had to take two years of German in school because of that
Die
Niemals xD
My sister had an English teacher who thought she lived in the UK bc she learned English from watching the Young Ones and TomSka with me
Also our unhealthy obsession with the Sex Pistols did help haha
As someone from the other side of the language border; I've never heard real Wallon, come to think of it
>~~It's beautiful lol~~
Das est prachtig
Well nowadays it's very rare to hear someone speak Wallon because it was forbidden to learn it at school
There are some politician who want to reintroduce it but they can't decide which form to take
Hahaha all is forgiven
Now I can enjoy r/ich_iel
and nobody can figure out what's going on in West-Flemish
Oedje mulle
I am always confused when playing rainbow six siege
You get a message 'the target is on the first floor', so I run up the stairs with my hard breacher, to disapproving looks of my team
In belgium: begane grond= gelijkvloers
Everybody so fucking flexing and where here just with body mas index and fries
It might seem rather insignificant, but we invented the saxophone
We also invented the saxophone and the contraceptive pill
I think you forgot about plastic
We invented the saxophone and the Mercator projection
Never heard of this
Weren't the Dutch first with stock exchange
Shit I forgot
Belgians are the inventors/discovers of (or involved in the process of doing so) in a surprisingly large amount of things in chemical and medical fields, considering how small our country is
Baekeland made the first fully synthetic plastic while working in the USA
Solvay discovered the process that's used to produce three quarters of the world's sodium carbonate
And institutes like the *Institute of Tropical Medicine* in Antwerp are known around the globe and played a major role in research of HIV and Ebola
Thanks bud
Yeah we produce SCARS which Belgians can obviously not use so they sell it to Not very ethical clients
Fuck you kaasvreter
That is cultural appropriation
The first stock exchange is in Antwerp I believe
It has recently finished restoration
Why not
I think we produce P90s aswell
Jazeker en zo hebben julie iedereen GEKOLONISEERD
I'm not fluent in Italian, but doesn't it say in here that the word "borsa" is derived from the "ter Beurze" building in Brughes
> Il termine "Borsa" deriva dalle riunioni per determinare il valore delle merci e delle valute che si tenevano a [Bruges] nel '300 e nel '400 presso il palazzo *Ter Buerse* (già taverna che radunava mercanti e specializzata nella loro consulenza[\[9\]] poi centro della piazza luogo degli scambi monetari e delle sedi "nazionali" dei mercanti stranieri), costruito dall'antica famiglia aristocratica *Van der Bourse*, che decorò (com'è ancora visibile) l'ingresso del palazzo con il proprio simbolo araldico: tre borse
[\[10\]] Dopo Bruges, le prime borse sorsero ad [Anversa] nel [1531] a [Lione] nel [1548] e a [Francoforte sul Meno] nel 1585
Il cammino delle borse fu quello di passare da una gestione privata ad una pubblica, fortemente regolamentata
Well my dear man story goes in ww2 American soldier in walonia (French Belgium) where offered fries and they thought they where in France
I mean the people
I think it is wrong to have a weapon factory that is in hands of the government that produces more weapons then the army need and sell it to Saudi Arabia and other violent people
Yeah I mean it’s actually a cool idea but in practice it doesn’t turn out good
But you can only know that cuz it happened
A Belgien just invented it
It's not his fault that people overuse it
I think we are still a lot better of then if he jad't invented it
But yeah the backlash isn't great
No problem thanks for liberating us
Haha yeah I formulated it weird I know
We have East and West Flanders, but that is a historical region, then also Vlaams-Brabant and Brabant Wallon which used to be part of Brabant (together with the now called province of Antwerp and Noord Brabant (NL))
The province of Antwerpen, Namur, Luxembourg and Liege are just named after their province's 'capital'.
Goodbye Limburg
Best part is that East Flanders isn't in the East of Flanders anymore
Didn't count that as a bland name
Somehow France has always been good at making people lose their own language and making them speak French
Its name comes from a city, the capital of the former Duchy: Limbourg
In the province of Liège nowadays though
I'm struggling with understanding what will actually change
People seem to just get worked up without much substance
Maybe it's just me not reading up on it, but then again it isn't terribly much reported in our newspapers
Young people complain about something they don't understand and make bad decisions
Nothing new under the sky(.)[
In all seriousness, I think it is great this got approved
The opposition has been wildly misplaced
A lot of concerns were raised, but in reality the biggest issues people had have been resolved
Where can we find a list of who voted what
I might doing something wrong, but on the Europarl website I can only see that a vote is schedule today, not the results
This is a directive
The EU has no say over this
It's entirely up to the member states to implement and enforce the laws
The EU will only sue member states which have done something illegal under the directive
Again, article 13/17 is not addressed to companies
It's addressed to member states
I don't think fully democratic countries exists
This is democracy these days:
Be a politician and look attractive to the people (and cooperation's) so they choose you
Get elected
Follow the parties interest
You can now help decide things for 4 years
This includes the decision of problems that where not present during the election
You have secured your pension so everyone can fuck off now
We are just an autocracy in disguise, they give us the feeling of choice and freedom but the truth is that we have no choice nor freedom
Most of those demonstrations came at least a year too late
There has been a lot of criticism about the directive way before the june 2018 vote
Most of that criticism came from academics, governments and even from the UN rapporteur
I know they didn't solve all the issues all the issues, but at least 80% of the issues that were brought up have been solved, and part of them were in the end rejected by parliament
For activists it's fair to bring in ideological issues with the directive, but they did that way too late
If you have issues with the directive, now it's the time to talk and/or discuss it with your national members of parliament BEFORE it's put into law
One of the things to gain with that is a strong voice on the table during stakeholder meetings
Another gain is can be a more flexible approach of exception to copyright protections
These tools are already provided in an earlier directive, but now will be the time that national laws will be re-evaluated
> Until Instagram blocks the upload of your photo of you and your spouse in front of the illuminated Eiffel Tower because apparently that needs to be licensed
Not for private citizens but the filter won't make a difference
If Instagram did that, they would have violated the law
Article 17(7) bans that
Companies only have to make a best effort to prevent the upload of specific works reported to them by the rightowners
That best effort is limited by the cost (Article 17(5)), as well as the fact that any such effort may not result in legitimate works being taken offline
Additionally, your Eiffel Tower example is a great way to illustrate what happens when no technology exists that could even begin to prevent re-uploads
If the owners of the Eiffel Tower go to Instagram, and ask it to prevent the upload of that work (being the Eiffel Tower), Instagram would simply cite recital 66 which says:
> _Different means to avoid the availability of unauthorised copyright-protected content could be appropriate and proportionate depending on the type of content, and, therefore, it cannot be excluded that in some cases availability of unauthorised content can only be avoided upon notification of rightholders
Or in other words, because it is impossible for software to distinguish photos of the Eiffel Tower reliably, it is completely acceptable they rely on the rigthholders reporting every individual photo separately
However, if you uploaded a full length Disney movie to YouTube, a platform would trivially be able to detect that, unless you specifically tampered with it, and be able to take it offline
This is so platforms are incentivised to do licensing agreements
Until now, YouTube could just profit off of that movie until the rightholder complained
They offered breadcrumbs to rightholders as "compensation". The rightholders were in no position to ask for a fair remuneration, because legally YouTube is allowed to profit off of pirated content - and the rightholders cannot simply walk away from the negotiations since they didn't upload their content in the first place
The mechanism ensures that YouTube also has an incentive to conduct licensing agreements, since now they will be required to make a transparent and best effort to prevent users from re-uploading the same content over and over again when it is taken offline
I used a Disney movie as an example here, but the impact is actually larger for smaller content creators who do not even receive breadcrumbs, and do not even get close to having the capacity to find all copies of their content
A regulation is an EU law
A directive is an EU legislative framework where member states are expected to implement a law that satisfies that directive
Every member state will make a different law, so /u/nanopulga suggests that websites will just ignore the laws
I know it's a bit extreme to suggest
But I think it would be possible to merge technology with politics
For example we could have a system that keeps some sort of trust tree and people assign trust to certain politicians
People can choice to revoke trust and give it to another politician or decide to step up and demand to be heard themselves
No need to plan elections, the political landscape can chance any time and politicians have no insurance they either do their job good or lose it
This is what I consider to be a democracy, the argument that the population can not micromanage an entire country might be true, but I think that if the population disagrees with a certain law we should be able to act immediately and not within the next election
Yes, because all these things do not matter if you aren't rich or have influence (those 2 usually go hand in hand)
- You can have freedom of speech, but what is the point of advertisers and big companies can decide to snuff out your platform if you cross their lines
- Freedom of press is a shitshow
A journalist is only as free as it's platform/medium allows it to be
Most mediums have a political agenda
If they speak on their own platform it will not reach a lot of people
- Freedom of assembly
Tell that to the yellow vest protesters in France
I'd rather call it Free to get beaten to shit by the police if your argument doesn't benefit the political agenda
- Right to private property
This is a right capitalism provides and doesn't really have much to do with democracy
- Right to due process
Also a shitshow
Yes you have to right to process but if you don't have monies good luck with that
Although it depends on what case thought
-  right to presumption of innocence
Again nothing to do with democracy, it's morals and how justice systems function
Also in most cases I you are guilty until proven otherwise
- Equality under the law
Sure, but it's those who practice the law that are doing it unequal
As long their are lobbyist and under table deals there will no be equality, its usually the party with the biggest pockets that wins
I've never seen pizza's served with additional sauces
Only thing you similar you get here is a little bag of hot chili oil if you get pizza at the kebab place
Dipping pizza in garlic sauce is defo a thing in belgium, I do it sometimes but it makes me feel extremely gross afterwards
Belgium:
Pros : small, nothing is really far
Every kind of food you'd want
Social security
Cons : politics is totally out of control, nothing is done anymore
Prices are increasing, life quality is slowly decreasing
Change is almost impossible
Salaries are not evolving (frozen for a long time) but cost of living are
There's a massive exode of graduated people that prefer getting a lower salary for a better quality of life somewhere else
>politics has been a shitshow since forever
I'm quite certain this is going on everywhere
> sad food culture
Welcome to visit us down here any time you like
> politics not as big of a mess as other countries
I wonder who you could refering to :)
Btw, I’m Belgian
But what would happen should the tax haven issue be handled
> in case of war we always get attacked first
I don't know
We had our fair share of unexpected visitations too ;)
Wow that's bleak
Politics is a problem, but I'm not experiencing the 'massive exodus' your experiencing
I believe we are actually better protected against rising prices than most countries, thanks to the index system that makes wages follow the cost of living, except for the occasional index jump
And I think quality of life is actually excellent over here
I'd say
Pros: great, varied food and beers
Multi-cultural
Well connected
Culturally vibrant for such a small country (festivals,...)
Cons: shitshow politics
Poor infrastructures (our highways make us the laughing stock of our neighbours)
Shit weather all year round
Small time mentality: very few ambitious projects attempted
Thanks for this :) didn't mentioned it because people often mention chocolate and waffles first :p if I go to another country, I'm almost always missing the Belgian beers if the country is not a beer country itself :)
The wages are actually not following the cost of living
Even though we can for sure not complain, because it's far better than a lot of other countries in the world
The quality of life is decreasing, with the raising of the retirement age, the pollution that's getting really a problem in cities, and the lack of general direction of the country
I'm really getting sick of this country
And a lot of people around me as well (not just 2 or 3, it's actually more 20 or 30)
We're just sick that the country does not care about it's people, and even less about the environment
Sick that the differences between the north and the south (not counting the German speaking people, but I don't forget them) cannot be resolved, due to stupid cliché... That are not entirely untrue
I lived in multiple other countries, like Spain and Czech Republic, and it was feeling a lot better
Agreed
You wrote it better than me
Thx
As retirement is still a long (and ever increasing )way off for me, that's not something that's really affecting my quality of life
And I think we're not exactly alone in the world with that issue, see for example the massive strikes in France
I think you might be a bit optimistic about other countries, they probably have their issues as well
(Spain and it's Catalans - I'm not sure that's doing better than Flanders and Walloons
The wages not rising as fast as the cost for living is pretty much anywhere though
yes, the traditional dutch kapsalon
Who could forget
Tbh you have to share those with us so you get only 50% credit
I'm not saying that everything is better somewhere else
Of course every country has its pros and cons
I just can't stand Belgium anymore
That started a few years ago, and it's been increasing ever since
I don't know anything about such word
However, since it seems there is a word for it in French and German, it's likely there used to be a word for this in Dutch as well
An old word, as we don't really have illegal abortions here anymore
I've heard the term Engeltjesmaker" maybe twice in my life before but other than that I agree
Not really a word for it in our modern vocabulary
For me that would be Die Wacht am Rhein and La Marseillaise
*Катюша* and *Священная война* by the Red Army Choir
Especially *Катюша*.
On a humoristic note: [Song of the Walloon Student]
The Soviet, Dutch (Wilhelmus) and French (La Marseillaise) Anthems, Bella Ciao and Scotland the Brave are all amazing songs imo
Whenever I hear the March of the Defenders of Moscow it makes me want to wear an ear flap hat, grab a Mosin-Nagant rifle, and run to give my life for the Motherland
Red Army Choir is amazing, too bad they pretty much died in that crash
I have that but with the song Jerusalem ("And did those feet in ancient time")
I'm neither English nor religious
Still I feel a weird patriotistic feeling when hearing and wanting to sing along to the song
They died in a helicopter crash a few years ago, if they are back it's just completely different people
I think it would be either Buizingen (two trains collided) or Ghislenghien (gas line explosion)
From those in reltively recent history was probably the [dioxin crisis] the [l'Innovation fire] and the [2003 heatwave]
From Italy, [Seveso] also comes to mind
Not big in casualties (fortunately), but definitely famous for its repercussions
"Thanks" to it, the EU adopted better safety regulations for the chemical industry:
> Industrial safety regulations were passed in the European Community in 1982 called the Seveso Directive,[15] which imposed much stronger industrial regulations
The Seveso Directive was updated in 1996, 2008 and 2012 and is currently referred to as the Seveso III Directive (or COMAH Regulations in the United Kingdom)
I'd say that the [MS Herald of Free Enterprise] can also count: a ferry that capsized right after leaving the port of Zeebrugge, killing 193
In addition to that, some other large disasters in Belgium were:
* The [**Marcinelle mining disaster**] in 1956, which killed 262 coal miners, and was the worst mining disaster in Belgian history
* The capsizing of the [**MS Herald of Free Enterprise**] in 1987, which killed 193 of the crew and passengers, as u/lunaclio already mentioned
* The [**explosion of a chemical plant in Tessenderlo**] in 1942, which killed 189 and injured more than 900
Like the explosion in Beirut, this explosion was also caused by improperly handled ammonium nitrate
Well, that, and y'know, the two World Wars can probably also be classified as disasters that killed a lot of people
More than any of the civilian disasters in Belgian history
Though some of the worst incidents during the Wars in terms of civilian casualties were:
* The [**explosion of a German ammunition train in Hamont**] in 1918, which killed an unclear number of civilians, which was later estimated to be about 1,000
* The [**bombing of Mortsel**] in 1943 by the allied forces, which killed 936 civilians
Mussels & fries
1 or 2 per year, no more
Probably a little more in Flanders located closer to the sea
Also waffles
Unless it comes from a craft stand located in the city center or the supermarket bought for children, nobody eats it often
When going to Brussels or Liège, you'll see a lot of shops selling waffles
I literally can't tell you the last time I ate a waffle
I think as Belgians we often forget the importance of waffles in our lives because we often reduce 'waffle' to the Brussels waffles you eat in tea rooms or the Liège waffle you eat in shoppingstreets in city centers
But we often don't think of all the other types of waffles that we've eaten way more often in our lives:
Suzy waffle / sugar waffle (when it's not from Lotus)] Basically the Liège waffle you can buy in the supermarket
I have eating this one hundreds of times in my life
[Eggwaffles] also the kind you buy in the supermarket
Really, really soft and they melt in your mouth
I'm not sure if this is just me, but I always seen this as a waffle for small children (wouldn't stop me as an adult to eat it though)
[(West-Flemish) Lukken] [butter crisps (Jules Destrooper version)]  a.k.a. New year's cookies: A very classy and classic cookie for when someone comes around for coffee, definitely around New Years
[Soft homemade fruit waffles] (often with tiny bits of apple, though the pieces weren't always obvious when eating the waffles): I made these myself as a kid (when I was old enough to already use the waffle iron obviously)
In my primary school it was also quite a popular thing to bring to school to eat during the break or to give to your class mates on your birthday (generally made by the moms ofcourse)
They're so deliciously soft
I don't have time left to continue now
If I think of something else I'll add it later on
Anyone else who wants to, feel free join in with the waffle love and waffle nostalgia :-)
I really love bigos with a good kielbasa which I clearly prefer to German or Alsatian sauerkraut
I know the recipe from my grandparents originated from Poland :), it seems there are a lot of different ones
I never thought of that as a purely Italian thing
I always assumed it was an (Italian inspired) American thing
But maybe Americans think it's Italian
Not sure
I'm pretty sure I've only heard of this concept through American sources
&#x200B;
I have spent some time around Italians when studying abroad (not in Italy)
And oh boy, you're barely kidding when saying that destroying Italian cuisine is a capital sin for you guys, you take the authenticity of Italian food very seriously
:-)
Also look at the restaurants who serve mussels in that period, it's a very common dish
I think it's rather a special case because if mussels are always associated with fries, I doubt that we eat on average fries more than 2-3x per month and often with burgers, carbonades, plain American, steak, "roulade" endives,etc
We have the same
And you have to take a sip before putting your drink back on the table
I chose to do it like this last year:
Latin: Blue
Math: Blue
Nature sciences: Green
Geography: Yellow
Dutch: Orange
French: Green
History: Yellow
Religion: Yellow
Technology: Red
Music: Black
The traffic is really, really bad
Anywhere on the highways near Antwerp or Brussels during rush hour and often outside of rush hour you will find yourself in traffic
Belgium is a transit country so we have a lot of trucks passing through, as well as a dated mentality in the populace about cars
(Meaning everyone will have one/two even if they dont even need it, because its still seen as somewhat of a status symbol) Our system of salary cars doesnt help the problem either
Sadly traffic is a complicated problem to solve and there seems to be no solution in sight anytime soon
Highest taxes in the world
The Flemish private medias are hold by groups/companies that were created by nazi collaborators, hence why the far-right ideas are so widespread and accepted as normal there
Flanders is probably the part of Western Europe that did the least to punish the fascists, who could continue their life like nothing happened
Haha, whenever I drive in the Netherlands, I honest to god say to my self "wow we really should visit more often, the have so much more green compared to Belgium"
And no government tot spend them
Werent there a lot of instances of suspected collaborators being killed after/near the end of ww2
At least thats what happened in my area
Some innocent people were killed because other folk thought they had been working for the nazis
I know about the media groups being owned by just a few people, but i didnt know we had been so kind to fascists
I know some politicians have ties (via their grandparents) to the nazi regime but never looked much into it, if the same is true for the press, thats more interesting to me
I think that's more about the swiss being much better off than the rest of european countries
Ever looked up net wages in belgium
No, it’s Belgium sadly enough
While I don't let it bother me both my dad and sister became a heck of a lot more racist after teaching/going to school in places like Ghent
Getting attacked as a teacher or my sister having to wait some days until I get done with school so we can drive home and constantly have Turks/Moroccans yelling at her(she's a blonde) to the point she doesn't feel safe waiting on the sidewalk doesn't exactly help
Ow, and the bunch of foreign kids who basically knocked out teeth with pool cues because you looked at them funny
On multiple occasions
Basically if they arrived at an establishment I left, cops  would be there soon anyway
[A video explains it] the title is a bit clickbait/provocative, but there are more nuances in the video
They have to split the 2018 budget in Parts of twelve and that Will be the working budget for 2019
Yeah no, this is yet another instance where wikipedia isn't well updated or w/e the issue is
Belgium is frequently ranked #1 and sometimes gets dropped to second place but only to quickly regain the first place ;)
Great explanation, even though I didnt always agree with the presenter
Also good to use my French again haha
On top of that we have a lot of "hidden taxes" like social contributions
I would say Gent
Whenever I hear tourists talk about Belgium, they often find Brussels boring, either find Bruges artificial or wonderful but everyone seems to love Gent
I have to agree, Gent has a great historical center, a vibrant student life, a practical public transport system and it's easy to bike there
Gent is for the younger people, Bruges for the elderly
Take the tourist out of Bruges and the city is dead, in Gent life begins when the tourists are gone
But that's not great per se
After living in Gent for 5 years I'm heading back to Bruges
The public transport isn't that great and cycling in Gent can be really dangerous (especially with the tram)
I agree that this is probably the best answer, but a lot of Belgians (unfairly, imo) hate Ghent for being a socialist bastion coming up with crazy socialist ideas like banning all car traffic from the city centre
Same with Leuven btw
I also came here to say Gent
Mechelen maybe
Foreigners may not know it, but I don't think I've ever heard a Belgian say something bad about Mechelen
The Welsh are lush
Bavaria seems to be pretty liked and it's a region nice to visit
Leuven is beautiful but mainly a student city, Antwerp is seen as your ordinary port city
Yet I think Antwerp is better than Gent
I think I've heard absolutely no-one hate on Gent because they're a socialist city
And I'm from rural West Flanders, no bigger hate for Gent than from rural West Flanders
Heck to this day my father won't visit Gent because he absolutely hates the city
I have never heard that Gent was a socialist city
I mean Gent tends to vote more to the left than Antwerp for example but that's it
Architecture or technology
Antwerp has I think more lovers but Gent will have less haters
Maybe I've spent too much time reading the comments on the Facebook pages of Belgian newspapers then, my apologies
I guess I based my experience on the backlash from the traffic circulation plan, but it's entirely possible I'm wrong, so my apologies
Yet Vienna is rated the best city to live in
Nothing like the good old comic murals in Antwerp
Gent is even better imo
The day you start taking HLN comments for truth is the day your life ends
Nice
I'm in my second year now
Lots and lots of work but you can bet that both your creative and theoratical skills will take enormous leaps in no time
Definitely
To be fair, I only read them to understand what people with a completely different mindset than my own think about the news (okay, yes, also to laugh at dumb people sometimes)
Also, it's not just HLN, it's De Standaard, De Morgen and VRT NWS too
Try reading the comments on more scientific things
I'm not overly educated in science(business guy) but the stupidity on display in many cases is almost impressive
Well you have to diversify your stupidity you know
I just think it's easier to have it all in one language
I know my dad (who's also a programmer) likes to name variables in Dutch
I cant stand it, tho
It's just too messy
English, but the problem is that sometimes we don't realize always that we're using false friends
My Mum has always shopped at Lidl, back in Germany my parents were on a tight budget, and now we go there because they have good products
People at my dorm make fun of it, and some say they don't trust the food, but they're all from well off parents so
Yeah
I go there because they also have German products
And bc my Mum eventually worked for a company that worked with Lidl on frozen meals for a few years
She said they demanded very high quality for low prices
It is seen as selling cheap/low quality products, although it has improved over the years
> Here in Czechia it’s one of the better one, while when I was in England everybody made jokes about how bad it is
Why is that
Maybe because products in Slavic Europe are even of lower standards/worse quality than the ones in Western Europe
Since Lidl is from Germany, a western country, what is low standards in the west might still be seen as better standards in ex-sovietic countries
I don't mean to offend of course, but the meats and products we find in Polish or Russian stores here are quite low quality, and each time there is a food scandal, it's very often with products from an ex eastern-block country
It’s bad, we also joke about it
>Colruyt
>pleasant experience
Colruyt literally has the aesthetic of a warehouse
Kind of the same story here in Belgium actually
Yeah
But everything is placed logical and the store is in general pretty clean
And don't forget that they sometimes bake little sausages or other stuff for customers to taste
Because it is known that you have lower quality standards, less controls over quality
We have plenty Polish immigrants in Belgium, and thus, you can find Polish stores with products imported from Poland, and the quality is definitely lower
The fact Polish people here comment that Lidl is seen as high quality quite proves the point as well
Eh I grew up on Lidl and Aldi stuff bc my Mum always likes to save money (and their produce is often better and cheaper than for example Colruyt)
If the budget is tight, you have no choice
Plus it's a piece of home in Belgium
The problem I have with this idea of being jealous when your so is meeting with another person of the opposite gender is what if your so was bisexual
She's no longer allowed to go out with friends at all
How does that work
Here's a fucking idea, don't be with somebody you don't trust
My sister always hung out with guys in high school(way less drama according to her)
If her boyfriend had issues with her 2 best male friends she has known for 10+ years they can sod off
In my 1st and 2nd year of high school, I was in a class with 18 boys and 3 girls (in the 2nd year 4) We were all really good friends and even though my friend from another class joked about me being in love with a good male friend from my class, everyone knew nobody in our class/in other classes was in a relationship
(And your sister is right, waaayyy less drama with boys XD)
Sometimes it's different though
My best male friend is going to another school (i know him from when i started school, so like 12 years) and I said to some friends that i dreamed that he was back and i was happy, because I am really going to miss him
They started singing that im in love with him, wich is not true
Conclusion: it's not really weird in Belgium, it just depends on the people that see it
In Flanders:
1) A close friend/family calls: "Yo" (really informal greeting), "Ja" (yes)
2) Known contact, but not really close: "Hallo, [name]" (Hello)
3) Unknown number: Met [full name] (with - as in talking with
4) Calling to a company, like your internet provider, this is what my mom often does: "Een goedemiddag, u spreekt met [last name] from [city]
" (Good afternoon, you're talking to ...)
Most of the time I say: "Allo me \[name\]" which is the dialect pronunciation of "Hallo, met \[name\]" (Hello, with \[name\])
1830, during the Belgian revolution
The first mention of Belgium is in Caesar's De Bello Gallico, where he describes the tribe of the Belgae as the bravest of all Gauls
It should be noted that Caesar's reasoning that we were the bravest is based on the fact that we were the furthest from Roman civilization and merchants only seldom visited, preventing things that would make a man "soft" from entering into our society, not actual battle prowess
Then for literally thousands of years, we're conquered by this or that kingdom (some argue that this is the reason why Belgians are pretty good at learning new languages), until we launch a revolution against William I of the Netherlands in 1830
Our national holiday, which for many countries marks the date that something significant happened for the foundation of their country, is 21st of July
It commemorates the day in 1831 that our first king, Leopold I (not to be confused with his son, Leopold II, who wrecked Congo),  acceded to the throne
Well we became independent from the Netherlands in 1830 and got our first king on 21st july 1831 (our national holiday)
But we were already independent as the United Belgian States from January 1790 untill December 1790
Julius Caesar is technically the first person that meantioned our country
Belgica was a province of the Roman Empire and the Belgae lived there (they were a mix between Gauls and Germanic peoples, just like Belgium now)
111 years old
lol that’s cool
Didn't France become a monarchy again after Napoleon for a couple decades
Maybe try [this] if you're interested
Do you know that a truck/lorry is [that] What kind of family has that to begin with even in the US
Otherwise, yeah, no need for a lorry, you can rent, have delivery, or borrow the van of an acquaintance, or borrow or rent a trailer to attach to your car
Most people know someone that has a car with tow hook & trailer or a van or can use one from work
Otherwise you can rent a van from the home improvement store, furniture store, rental place (you can rent anything here: vans, trailers, diggers, scissor lifts, etc
), etc
or have their stuff delivered for an extra fee
Delivery of large items is even free at a lot of stores
Say I live in an apartment on the third floor and I need a new fridge
If I have the new fridge delivered, the delivery guys will bring it to the third floor and take my old busted fridge of my hands for recycling (we pay recupel tax for this)
If I were to pick up my new fridge at the store I would have to lug it to the third floor myself and get my old fridge down to the ground floor as well
Sometimes we just make multiple trips
Say I need 500kg of gravel (20 bags of 25kg)
I'll just make 2 trips to the home improvement store's drive through and get 10 bags each trip in my regular car
Everything is close by, so an extra 20 minute trip is just less hassle
I think you got yourself confused
People in the US refer to semi-truck as "semi" and pick-up truck as "truck".
Pick-ups aren't trucks, they are big cars/SUVs
Truck/lorry is [that] That's the only thing that can be called a truck
We do that here too in Belgium
Belgians love home improvement
If you need a lot of drywall you just have it delivered
If you only need a small amount you can rent a van at the home improvement store (sometimes even free for a certain amount of time/distance)
Otherwise you borrow a van or trailer from someone (dad, uncle, friend, work, etc
You could also rent one from a car rental place, but that's usually more expensive than using the store's van
My parents drive a small Mazda2, but my dad has a small trailer he bought second hand for €250 that can hook up to it when he needs to haul larger items
He's hauled bricks, new doors, a washing machine, a refrigerator, a large dinner table, a 65" TV and much more in that thing
This way they can drive a small car that easily fits everywhere while still being able to transport larger items when the need arises
> You do realise that truck simply means a vehicle designed to transport cargo, right
It must be designed to transport cargo, and weight more than 3 500 Kgs
What you have shown is a truck, because it is clearly heavy, and is utilitarian before anything
Pickups aren't trucks because : they weight less than 3,5 tons, and their utilitarian side is secondary, most people use them as SUVs/big fancy cars
Having a small open trunk isn't enough to be called a "truck".
To drive a truck, you need a special driving license that allows you to drive vehicules above 3500 kgs, called C license
You can drive a pickup with a normal B license, hence why it isn't a truck
Trucks are vehicules that require a C driving license in Europe
Makes sense
If they don't give delivery for free when you buy a lot they wouldn't be selling over here
I think there is in general a bit less DIY
My father was big into that but I'm more a guy that goes "each has their job".
If I need something I hire somebody that does it for a living
To be fair, money isn't really a concern for me
Might bother more if it was
Same type of behaviour if a Belgian goes to Corsica : if they think you are from France, they are unpleasant with you, they become much nicer when they know you are not French
The German Walloon are quite nice
Little sidenote for the non-Dutch speakers who are reading this
The verb 'oppassen' can mean 'watch out', it can be used it 'dangerous' situations: someone crossing a street or someone dropping a glass on someone's foot
But it can also mean 'keep an eye on': for example keeping an eye on someone's kid, or keeping an eye on someone's backpack when they go to the restroom etc
Very similar meanings but slightly different connotations
The noun 'oppas' as 'babysit' has more the connotation of 'keeping an eye on'.
Yeah, this is probably the best I can think of
I don't think it's used a lot in Flanders (more a word from the Netherlands I think) , but I live close to the Belgian - Dutch border, so we got some overlap and it's used here too
From West-Flanders, close to the French border (so, far away from the Netherlands)
I've definitely heard the word 'oppas' being used around here too
I think this depends regionally, I never used it and the people around me don't either, my mom mentioned it's more of a thing from the Netherlands
I live in southern province Antwerp close to Vlaams Brabant
So I suppose it really is a regional thing
Oh really
I always thought of it as more of a Dutch word than also being used in Flanders a lot
Wow, learn something new every day
Wow ok, thank you
Zijde zeker dadde noar 't west vloanderen woart gegoan
No such thing in Belgian schools
Definitely not a general thing
Belgian schools have a few distinctions: in academic secundary education (ASO), there's no cooking in any school I have experience with
They are more focused on sciences and laguage
Skilled profession secundary (BSO) has it, but I'm pretty sure it depends on your curriculum
I'm not sure about art school (KSO), but then again, nobody who's not in arts school has a clue what they do over there
Really
In French-speaking Belgium, there is no such thing, at least not if you are in general (so, the options aimed at academic studies after secondary school)
I’m against it
Pretty easy to tell you how I feel about it
It happens all the time
Imagine that someone would actually have to know Dutch to live here
Unimaginable
Well for resident status I wouldn't impose any language requirements, people should still be able to learn the language and customs once here
But for citizenship I think it isn't too far-fetched to have as a requirement that you should show some measure of integration, or at least the means of engaging in society
And for that language is essential
I'm not saying that they should have perfect Mastery of that language, but at least be able to work efficiently
What if they learned a Sami language
Seems to be the consensus somewhat
Should technically be possible, but not exactly the smartest move for the immigrant
There is a university my friend goes to and it says that any scientific or otherwise discoveries made by students who go to the university belong to the university, their reasoning was that they used university property so that apparently makes it fair to take the discovery from the student
He decided to do his research at home, or keep it a secret untill the university no longer has claim to any discoveries he may make, doubt he's gonna make any though, he studies pharmacy things so it's gonna be hard to make discoveries I think
who likes winter
it's cold and there is less stuff to do outside
You ignore them
Live here for 8 years, couldn't give you a name of who lives within 5 houses of me in any direction
My parents are best friends with everyone on their street, they go running together, celebrate birthdays together and they play darts, cards, chess, etc
together
But they also live in the countryside
I recently moved from Belgium to a city in Germany and I don't really know what my neighbors look like
We try to avoid eachother in general, but if you ask something of someone, doesn't even matter if he/she isn't your neighbour, they will do they're best to help you
I know everybody in a 3 mile radius around my house by face and when we cross eachother we smile or nod
But you don't really see people break the silence to often
And when the do, most of the time they're from the Netherlands
I only talk to the ones next to me or across the street of me, all the rest gets a good day to you
Personally i don't want to get too close with them as then they start conversations over the garden fence when i'm in the garden chilling
i don't have the need for that, a quick chat at the door while coming home/leaving no problemo
It's your own choice
People won't be mad if you don't look for contact
But if you just moved it's much appreciated that you at least introduce yourself
I know most of the people living in my street, or at least I know in what house they live
My neighbour-neighbours we know very well, we accept each other's mail, have a drink
I know I would do the same
30-45 minute bus ride or 30 minutes by car
Shop connected to my house
I've had cases where I woke up at 9

30 Seconds right across the street
And a folding bicycle
I love the slavic name ‘Polina’
To be fair, Polish can make anything sound badass
"financially independent" move-out between 22 and 32 mostly
In Belgium people just leave when they feel ready i still live with my parents at age 24 my dad did not move out until he was 27 less than a year before i was born i'm planning to move out later this year or next year some of my friends already moved out at age 21
According to some people on the internet my country is not a country
We technically deposed our monarch and stripped him of his powers to pass a law to make abortion legal then reinstated him after we passed the law and he couldn't block it anymore
This was 1990 so not all that long ago
Out royal family doesn't even have a royal crown (I think)
In the Elder Scrolls games (and extended universe) there is an elfish race named Bosmer, or Wood Elf
'Bos' is the Dutch word for 'forrest'.
In Flanders some people use ''ezel'' as an insult, but it's not really common
Like: "Eej stoemen ezel". But again, not common
Probably only heard it a couple times in my life
Haha I remember that, it was really weird the first time I read it
It probably sounds a bit more exotic to English speakers than just the word 'leech'.

I haven't see such device abroad
Answer to your question : euh, waffles aren't eaten that much as thought abroad
How flat are your flat lands
That really depends on the circles you're in
I don't know many people that don't smoke weed for example
Not just the younger people, also my Dutch dad and most of his friends smoke weed and have plants themselves
you’re not Belgian sooo
Not that I know
>some maybe around 800m.
That higher than everything in Belgium, you definitely all live in mountains
I've seen it quite a bit, but always in the context of porn
Our first king, Leopold I, married princess Charlotte of Wales, who was second in line to the throne
If she hadn’t died after only one year of marriage, our future king would one day have been the husband of the queen of England
He was then offered the crown of Greece, but declined because he thought the country to be too unstable
That’s how he ended up becoming king of our newly founded country, Belgium
Imagine declining a crown to an unstable country and then founding *Belgium*
In the last week alone I've seen this myth that Fritz was the one who did that being spread 3 times already
There have been defenestrations in Leuven a very long time ago
Then again Leuven only has about 100
000 inhabitants (the actual number is higher because there's about half as many students but since they go home in the weekend they're not official inhabitants)
A frituur, you could compare it with a McDonalds but all frituren are privately owned (so frituur is not a chain or brand or anything) and they are cheaper and way better than McDonalds
Edit: also way smaller than a McDonalds, most have like 3 tables max or so
The big flemish parties voted against it like the dumbasses they are
I like Pfand it'll solve a lot of littering problems Belgium has
One of the best things about living in Belgium, I'm always disappointed by the dominating presence of bad fast food chains in most other countries
They are everywhere here and I love it
Netherlands and Belgium love to prepare all kinds of things in croquette style too
Kroketten
We have them w cheese, with garnalen
Witfloof
It's a loan word from your bullar
Appletizer is too sweet :/
It can basically be compared as a name with "pub" or "cafe".
We have them all over the place here in Belgium and the good ones make a lot of money
It’s an actual thing, indeed
Belgium has loads of them
My town has only 8000 people and we have like 5 of them
Yeah, very comparable to a chippy
I have no idea what that is, but they seem like a brand and don’t really look like a frituur
But it’s not, actually
Well, everybody knows civilization ends at the frontier of the [western roman empire]
Here in Belgium it seems that some people do a cold breakfast and lunch and a hot dinner or they have a cold breakfast and dinner but a hot lunch
Personally I eat my hot meal at dinner
Lunch is bread or sandwiches
NVA claims that the prices of the goods will go up and they say it's not as effective as recycling, which is bs
They promised to have a discussion and evaluation, but then we had to go vote so
A lot of people suspect lobbying
I recentst read an article that, on good days, they make €3
200
Maybe I should just quit my studies and start a frituur
VB and Open Vld are also against
Together with N-VA they have a blocking majority in parliament
No, that would be the friteuse
A friend of my father owned one for 20 years
He retired when he hit 40
I mean
yes, being successfully self employed will earn you more money
Know of course 50% go bankrupt within 3 years or something
Not entirely
Those look more like restaurants, most frituren have like 3 tables max
Thanks
Wow, ugh
Get some sense in them
[Brussels waffles with "warme krieken"]
(The first and second picture, not of great quality, but at least it looks real and it shows you how it is served)
Edit: For those who are not familiar with 'krieken'. In Flanders and Southern Netherlands we call a sour cherry (prunus cerasus) 'een kriek'. "Warme krieken" is a kind of sweet sauce made out of [prepares sour cherries] You use the sap that is in the jar to make the sauce, then add the cherries back into the sauce
We eat it with Brussels waffles and ice cream as dessert, but can also with meatballs and a slice of bread as a proper meal
The belgian cake called [Brésilienne] (literally called ("Brazilian")
Die krieken maken het wel af
My absolute favourite sweet dish coming from our country
It only rather recently occured to me that they are 100% a Belgian thing, and not imported from France or Austria or whatever
I don't think I've ever seen them offered abroad anyway, while over here they are offered almost everywhere
From the smallest bakery to the biggest supermarket
Brésilienne, the crème-glace or the gateau, with extra notjes
Inderdaad
Voor mij moet het ook echt gewoon met warme krieken zijn en niets anders
They are two totally different things
The Brussels waffle is used like crépes, you need to put things on top of it, like powdered, sugar, fruit, ice cream, chocolate etc
The Liége waffles is a snack made out of a dense dough with small bits of sugar crystals in them
It is usually eaten without any toppings
It's pointless to compare the two
I honestly don't know and did't find any info on internet, sorry
Hell no ! It's custard, sweet whipped cream and nuts ! That's delightful
Ik wou appelflappen zeggen maar heb het opgezocht en het komt uit holland, raar dat zo iets lekker van daar komt
My thoughts exactly
Lakmans are waffles too, no point in comparing them to Brussels waffles
The same goes for Kempense galetten
Je verstaat toch wat krieken zijn, ik zie het probleem niet
Een kriek is niet hetzelfde als een kers
Leer eerst wat het verschil eenis tussen kersen en krieken, en dan mag jij meepraten over eten
Even genoeg gelachen, maar een kriek is dus niet zomaar een kers
Wat wij in Vlaanderen en Zuid-Nederland 'Krieken' noemen, heet in de rest van Nederland een 'Morel', een zure kers (*prunus cerasus*) als het ware
Een kriek is dus een kers maar niet elke kers is een kriek
Het bier type 'Kriek' is ook vernoemd naar dit type kers
Als we in België over kersen spreken, bedoelen we vrijwel altijd de zoete kers (*prunus avium*)
You did attacked a neutral country (Belgium) without any valid reason, you launched the offensive on civilised nations, so, yeah, you started it
Yes, many breweries have their version of Christmas beer, usually darker, sweeter and stronger in alcohol
Nearly every brewery in Belgium have a specific "winter/Christmas special beer". There are dozens of those
Not beer but 'jenever' and glühwine are popular during Christmas time
Depends on the beer
Leffe Christmas beer is an abomination that we should've never released to the world
Or Leffe in general
I'm still surprised how popular it is outside of Belgium
AB Inbev pushing lesser beers abroad because they don't sell here anymore
Depends on the area
In cities, not anymore
As far as you can go "rural" in Belgium, it tends to be more common
My parents for example have a woodstove
Me in Antwerp on the other hand, wouldn't make any friends with it
It wasn't exactly an empire, but Leopold II had Congo as a private property
In school, we learned that he used the profit he made there to enrich Belgium and especially build large buildings, we learned that Congolese people were brought to Belgium and displayed as animals in a zoo, we learned about the massacre and attrocities he ordered in Congo, etc
In the end Congo became Belgian property and later, they gained their freedom again
However, we learned that the Belgian government should have handled their independence differently (should have helped them more with the transition) as not shortly after, there was a crisis in Congo
It's definitely not a part of history we are proud of, but I am glad we learned about it in school
Because I feel like more often than not, the dark parts of your own country's history are quickly glazed over
Well, it probably would have been better if you stayed a republic
Maybe more likely, if said republic hadn't treated South Netherland/Belgium as badly and persecutively as Willem I did
Vic de Wachter in Flanders
I like his voice more than David Attenborough, honestly
Attenborough also speaks very unclearly in my opinion
I feel like Jacques Cousteau would be more iconic no
Or maybe that's just on an international level I don't know
Anyway, next to David Attenborough, he was the first to spring into my mind when thinking of iconic European documentary presenters
I was thinking about Rudi Vranckx
Surely it's Peter Cremers
Oh yes, of course
I was thinking of nature documentaries
Both voices are well known, but Vic De Wachter's name is more known, I think
He did many BBC documentaries such as Planet Earth and Planet Earth II
Sometimes people confuse the two voices
Right now, our 9 (?!) health ministers, I guess
With the literally biggest one Maggie De Block
Orders masks from a scam in Turkey, then orders masks not at a good standard for fighting against the covid
Then orders masks without the stripes to attach them to the ears
Oh, and helped cut the hospitals budget by 900 M€ a few years back with the now prime minister
That's a croque madame
They're known as "croque monsieur" amongst Dutch speaking people in Belgium
If you asked me for a tosti, I wouldn't even know what you were talking about
I thought he was specifying it wasn't croque monsieus for some reason
But yea, love them
I often take it if I need a quick snack somewhere
A croque madame has a fried egg on top though
You mean the croque monsieur machien
Surely a croque madame is more common
Croque monsieur with a friend egg over it
You have bacon in your croque
Mines always with ham
We have them also with bolonaise sauce in it
't Krokmasjien
I don't think there is a strict rule saying you can't put anything on top though
Still sounds better with bacon
It's the same in all of Belgium and France to my experience
No sauce
I think that the real contribution of Belgium goes further than simply hosting the institutions (all other member States would gladly take them) or being a founding member (there's nothing exceptional about that)
The main contribution, in my opinion, is in the art of compromising
We are experts in squabbling, negotiating, tearing ourselves apart, but in the end reaching a compromise nonetheless, and we are recognized as such in European political circles
This is why two of the three Presidents of the EU council have been Belgians
Our expertise, built for decades internally in community conflicts between flemings and walloons, is helpful at the EU level too
Furthermore, with one half of the country looking north and the other looking south, we are well placed to bridge this gap also found in European politics
•Founding member of pretty much every big European project (ESA, CERN) and the EU,
•Brussels
•Politicians, mainly ex-prime ministers who become president of the councel of Europe
(Van Rompuy and Charles Michel)
Brussels is home to the EU's most important institutions:
* Main seat of the European Parliament (the only reason Strasbourg is still around is because it's still officially in the treaties and the French refuse to give it up)
* European Commission
* European Council (which is not the same as the Council of Europe)
Besides being the de facto capital of the European Union, it also houses NATO's headquarters, the most important military alliance in Europe
Not just the presidencies, but Belgians are disproportionally represented in high level EU jobs
Beautiful text but full of crap
I can say that, source : am Belgian, knows our history
We've also dumped Tindemans, Martens, Dehaene and Verhofstadt there
The EFTA wasn't the precursor but the competing agreement
>Germany is one of the nations that forms the bedrock of the EU along with France, Italy and (formerly) Britain
By including Italy I assume you mean founding members
If so, it's quite shameful to exclude the BeNeLux from it
That being said, most of the other things I can agree on
I certainly don't. Last time I drank Guinness I drank a Belgian beer before it
The Guiness tasted as bland as it could get
Edit: but then again, the Belgian beer was "Oude Geuze Boon".
Glad that we contribute in more than one way
Our country was literally founded by compromise
While it's a funny meme
It doesn't matter much if the federal government takes too long to form if you have 5 other governments that make everything run more or less smoothly for the average joe
Might aswell add beer and waffles then ;)
How is hosting the
•European council,
•European parliament,
•European commission,
•NATO,
•EESC,
•EDA,
•IEEA,
•EUROCONTROL,
•and many more,
not a major contribution to Europe
You do know that this makes us a target for anyone against the EU or Europe in general or even NATO, right
What do you mean
•Is there sugar in Belgian beers
To answer that question you need to specify the beertype
Are there mainstream beers with sugar
Yes, most mainstream "kriek" (cherry) beer (or fruitbeer in general) has added sugar
But that leaves the vast majority of beers that don't have sugar added to them, even the original "kriek" beers don't have that
•Do we put sugar in our beer like people do with tea or coffee
No, never
Why is Italy making these demands
Well, Kriek is widespread ofcourse, as you can buy it everywhere, but so are all other kinds of unsweetened beer and those far outnumber Kriek
A cold kriek like Lindemans on a warm summer day, is good yes
But I wouldn't compare it to a beer like a Trappist or a Geuze ofcourse
(Edit: also note that most good version of this beer aren't as sweet as you might think)
But a proper unsweetened Kriek (without added sugar) like [Oude Kriek Boon] is heavenly though
[Léon Degrelles] and the [Rexist party] for the French-speaking side, [Staf Declercq] [Hendrik Elias] and the [Vlaams Nationaal Verbond] for the Dutch-speaking side
Verhofstadt
Don't forget [Cyriel Verschaeve] the crazy thing is there are still a few streets named after this traitor
A few weeks ago one of these cities (Kortrijk) decided to rename the street to a resistance fighter from WW I.
Id even dare to add Leopold III
Would you consider Gorbatjov a traitor
promised center-right politics based on entrepreneurship, then made a huge U-turn to globalism and radical leftist politics
Yeltsin was the one during the 90's right
Indeed socialist, i am somebody who calls such a disgusting u-turn guy a traitor
Child molestation in the Catholic Church sure is a big scandal
Someone set fire to a building designated as a future assylum centre for refugees
The major concern is the rising extremism on the right wing
Some are questioning the discours that was used by the right wing parties against the installation of this particular centre and if it may have instigated the arson
Not to mention that this party was and sometimes still is referred to as a facist party
Who is Epstein
The only Epstein I have ever heard about is the creator of the Epstein Drive in The Expanse books and TV show
Wallonia basically feels like a different country, that’s quite weird
How rude people in big cities are
I’m from Flanders and am amazed by how much nature and little houses Wallonia has in comparison
I don’t know if I could call it a culture shock though, but I live close to the language border and there is an immediate difference when crossing it
Very true
As soon as I go to Flanders I notice the differences
Different houses, different infrastructure, different people
Also, so many bikes
Well, we already had a couple of wars before
Seriously, nothing wrong with German or Austrian beer, we just have a bit more distinctive styles
I'm envious of all the bike paths
Here, we only have one bike path along the Meuse
(it's an awesome bike path tho)
Wait wait, there are no bike paths in Wallonia
Basically, if there's no alternative, yup
We sometimes have to
I'm actually pretty lucky because most of the way from my village to the nearest city has a bike path next to a river, completely separated from the road, but in the city, I basically just have to deal with cars and share the road with them
Including the old assholes in Mercs who think endangering my life, theirs, and other people's is worth not losing fifteen seconds
Oh, so very few
They exist, but [they're not nearly as common in Wallonia as in Flanders]
You're a poet
And so overly British
Love it
They’re turning an electric train (well metro) into a diesel train
Y'all are lucky
What's weird here is that you can see the border between Wallonia and Flanders if you look at a [map of bike paths]
But I am one of said Frenchies
:'(
(also, Belgian separatism isn't viable, but that's a whole 'nother topic)
But that sub is full of Dutch people and y'all have weird accents
BELGICA STRONK
Not that I know of
We're a peaceful bunch
And in fact, I really do like my Flemish countrymen
French and Dutch people are just neighbourinos with silly accents, but overall nice
At least in my opinion
I mean they make good wine, but apart from that, they're just weird
They can't even say 70 properly
(also, they vote for far-right and that ain't cool)
I have, on occasion, been known to drink beer out of a glass that was not specifically designed for that beer
In my defence, sometimes you have too much beer and not enough glasses, and I do try to stick to the shapes as much as possible
I'm not too fond of kids
I like dutch people and their accent (please don't kill me guys, I know it's wrong)
I'm not really into chocolate
I say "pain au chocolat".
I hate beer
And I don't give a fuck about football
Out
Heresy
I'm ok with pilsners but I hate Trappists or any stronger beer really
*takes note*
At least you like beer
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
Ping pong no 1581 for you
>"That sounds Spanish to me"
We have ''That sounds Chinese to me'' (in Dutch)
That just must've been Dutch people then idk, we very much refer to ourselves as Belgians
That or Flemish/Walloon
That is really interesting though
I mean Belgians are generally pretty calm people, but that a country on the other side of Europe would have a saying referring to us is very interesting
I wonder how that came to be
Blackface
In my school we have a rule that you can't wear too 'extreme' clothes to school, but nobody really cares as long as you don't come to school naked
Does anyone actually uses these, only the weird kids with overprotective parents use it
When I was young I used to love horse meat, I ate it everyday
Yes, the story says that they’re actually white, but they bring the presents through the chimneys so their face gets dirty from all the ashes in the chimney
While I also doubt that's true I fall asleep nice and warm in the Alps in my T-shirt
You snowboard, drink some hot chocolate and sit in the sun nice and hot
You watch the temprature and of course it's still freezing
Ice cold if it's that temperature back in Belgium though
No clue why
Would be my guess
Permanently cold air far away from the coast and high up -> dry air -> less loss of heat
Same reason that 20 degree water is cold, 20 degree weather isn't. Water is better at removing heat, flowing water is even colder still(to the touch)
My father has a background in being a kinder garden teacher so his entire life he did these types of things
When he taught in high school for example he would still do it with a few volunteers he found and just go through all the classes during the day and sharing some candies during classes because why not
It's a fun time for everyone
He used to play the Saint and all that but he's a rather well known figure around these places and turned to play a Piet because of it like 20 years ago
There appears to be not much available about everyday life in Belgium on YouTube, except for this one [
Maybe it's because Belgians don't think it is necessary to tell other people how good life can be in Belgium, if you don't mind the 5 (or is it, or 7) governments, the tax burden, the lousy weather at times, the traffic jams
There is more than beer, fries, mussels or chocolate, Brussel/Bruxelles, Antwerpen, Liège or Brugge, Mons
Oh yes
FIFA #1
Just saying
in Belgium at certain events we play the song les lac du connemara and swing hankerchiefs or whatever piece of white paper or cloth in the air
EDIT: also people in their final year of highschool pull all sorts of stuff like building baricades, fireworks, lewd chalk writings on  Chrysostomos/hundred days (till graduation)
oh belgians put a front door in your garden when you reach 40-50 etc
this is just how my school plays football
We also have Sinterklaas in Belgium (but in some parts it's Sint-Maarten)
Wait does Sinterklaas not come on 6th December in the Netherlands
Here in Belgium a few people (including me) do that as well
I wouldn't know why you wouldn't want to do that, it's so handy
He sticks around for a couple of weeks here too and the gift-giving happens on the night between thr 5th and the 6th (parents put the gifts after the kids are asleep so the kids will see them when they wake up on the 6th)
Leopold II
Leopold II, but that's hardly a secret at this point, especially on Reddit
I mean, compared to alot of other historical figures, that doesnt really sound like a "bad guy".
Exactly
he was a monumental cunt and this is why I listed him as "famous, but a really bad person"
* Deciding to be a centralised country at its start, while we should clearly have been a federation or confederation since the beginning
* In extension of that, forcing down French as single national language, making Walloon progressively disappear, and antagonising the non-bourgeois and non-aristocrat Flemish people
While I accept French as my native language, I would prefer if we had kept our historical Walloon dialects
*Colonisation of Congo was bad too, but I don't think dumb is the proper term to use for that case
Belgian confederation, like Switzerland
That sounds good, I like it
Small
we have 11 million people, which is more than Switzerland, a confederation, and its 8 millions inhabitants
Flanders has around 6,5 million people, which is bigger than a good deal of European countries, and Wallonia has around 3,5 million people, which is bigger than some European countries too
Brussels region has 1 million people
[Here is a map on the subject] is bigger than many European countries
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Austria, which, like Switzerland, are smaller than Belgium, are federations too
Theoratically it’s more democratic than a monarchy
In term of population, we are bigger than [all these countries]
For some reasons, people seem to assume that small territory means small population, yet, with the Netherlands, we are the most densely populated country of Europe
Belgium for its red letters, Iceland for its blue letters
Liechtenstein for its white letters on black backgrounb
Luxembourg and Netherlands for their black letters on yellow background
I think [the Belgian ones] are pretty great
The [old UK ones] are also cool
The stripy flags at the top and bottom took some getting used to because I found them very busy on a license plate
Now though, I really like it and it's also very recognisable
The [decal on plates from Salzburg] was particularly great to me because the lion on it looks just like the [Flemish lion] and the Austrian flag is the same as the [flag of the city Leuven] which is where I'm from
What a coincidence
Yes, when the plate is rather new the colour is pretty nice
Plus, it’s unique and easy to see who your fellow Belgians are on the road
They're very recognisable when you're on holiday and foreigners are very recognisable when your inside the country
I'm quite certain people from every country feel like their plates are "the norm" and "good looking" because we grew up with them and literally see them every day
That explains it
I've always found the German license plates very nice because the number combination is always very nice
Never knew this was because you have some kind of say in what the license plate should be
I also really like the [short plates] must be fun to get one of those
My favourite license plates are still those from Slovenia though
The green really pops and the shields look good, even from a distance (unlike those german circle things
I like license plates with special colours
You think
They're actually stamped metal, that's the nicest part
Most other countries seem to have flat printed ones now
Those are green here
I think Brussels and Antwerp will always see the most growth
They are the economic powerhouses of Belgium and the most populous
Antwerp is currently working on infrastructure, like massive projects, redesigning the 'ring around Antwerp', rebuilding pre-metro stations, redesigning town squares or making new ones, the same goes for parks, cycling routes etc
We also have Nieuw Zuid which is currently being build, and about 10 to 15 years ago we got massive projects a bit downstream on 'het eilandje', etc
In short, lots of projects
Skyscrapers are generally a rarity in Belgium, because it messes up the old city skylines
Iirc no building in Antwerp may ever be taller than the O.L.V. Cathedral
NIETS is hoger dan de kathedraal
A lot of countries or cultures have a national dance
We don't even have anything close
LGBT+ stuff in general
I don't really know that many people who are LGBT+, there aren't many spaces dedicated to us, and I certainly don't know of any near where I live
Typical French
Forgetting Belgium exists
I don't need it 90% of the time but when there is a heat wave it is really painful here
Sorry if I sound ignorant, but what do you mean by 'spaces dedicated to us'?
Happy cake day
Somewhere to go that's mostly for us
A common example would be an lgbt+ bar, for example
Somewhere to hang out with people like me and to meet them, etc
I'd never heard of this, so I guess your comment is right
We really lack in LGBTQ stuff
I write in cursive, so, there is never a line in lowercase cursive
Never used it with a line, maybe it is a Flemish thing ?
Yeah I do it the same
Flemish here, never saw anyone writing it with a line before
Didn't even know this was a thing
Yup, learned it like that too
We are taught to write z like [here]
Written, capital Z doesn't have a line but more of a swirl
That's how I leanred it
It is somehow common yes, but most of the time, since they are to honour family members, godfathers/godmothers etc
most people don't like them
Most of the time, you only see them on official papers, and don't know said second name of your friends and family (cousins, aunts/uncle, grandparents) members
I have a compound one that I don't like in my case, but that manages to refer to : my godfather, my former/ex-godmother, and 3 of my grandparents
They're quite common, thought I feel less common for the younger generation
I'm in my twenties, I don't have a middle name, most people around my age that I've talked to about second names do not have one
But I feel that for the generation of my parents it is super common
But I don't feel like their second name is really used in general
Then again, this is purely anecdotal, I don't know most of the young people in Belgium and I've never read a study/survey on it
Same here
I know someone and his second name is Squanto, like come on
I have no idea tbh
Saying "how are you" when you mean "hello". And answering "I'm great", even when they feel miserable
Going to a drive-through for all of their food - even coffee and donuts
Why
Edit: also not adding the taxes in the price that is displayed
How hard is it to show the price you actually have to pay
And your weird railway system
How they act towards their flag
I mean, most Belgian flags either have a big Jupiler, Red Devils or SportsDirect logo on them or have faded colours and it is no big deal
I don't mean that disrespecting a flag is ok, because of everything it represents
But I feel like sometimes letting the american flag touch the ground is the worse thing one could do in their life
Their love of guns, imperial units, truck culture (??? the average guy isn't even hauling anything most of the time man why that pickup ?), fast food culture, culture of waste (ever heard about recycling ?)
The pledge of allegiance is very unsettling
Children shouldn't have to do such a thing, and certainly not the part about god
What about freedom of religion and secularism
Sueing, I cut the roof of my mouth to some cereal
Sure the company
I trip from a wet floor in any company's building
Sue the company
Kissing your children on the mouth
Where i live it is always full
they have harvey kellog to thank for that (yes that kellog)
Waffles as breakfast food hurts me as a Belgian as well
Oh yes, it's not something exclusively american
It's just the first thing I thought about
I'm not talking for the rest of the country
It was a question about what I find an odd (american) habit
This was one
And no, I don't use this as a formula
I say it as a open question, otherwise I use hello
You use them
We have some McDonald’s “restaurants” with drive-thrus but I’ve literally never seen someone use them
??? No
We definitely don’t have any donut place with a drive through, and as far as a know also not a Starbucks or other coffee place with one
Sounds like a recipe for disaster tbh
But the drive throughs are so lazy, and why would one eat in his or her car
And about the taxes: what about poor people who have to count how much money they can spend in a shop
Don’t make it even harder for them
About the trains: you not having any railway system near you is actually exactly what I mean
But apparently, some children still get in trouble if they refuse do to it, depending the teacher or school
That's weird
There is always a line at my local McDonalds
A preference for local food is actually a global trend
*hour rant in somthing that once resembled Dutch about how miserable I feel*
Really
In 15 years I think I’ve seen like 5 cars at my local one (and we’re quite a big city, though)
Lol, up until 2 months ago we didn’t even have a Burger King in my country
I do but: nobody there
It’s so crumbly, I’d be annoyed with my car being dirty and touching the steering wheel with my greasy hands
Wait, actual restaurants have drive-thrus too
If that’s true, that’s honestly so sad
I’d rather just enjoy my meal in the restaurant
Your car get crumbly and dirty
You don’t have a proper table
You don’t have a fork and knife
Burger King bought Quick and the first one opened 2yrs ago in Antwerp
Omg yes it was KFC 2 months ago, isn’t it
Is dat al 2 jaar geleden en niet 2 maanden ofzo
That’s really weird
The main reason we didn’t have Burger King was apparently because of our strict food safety laws, because we already have 67 McDonalds and because we have what we call the “frituur”, which is kind of McDonald-ish but better and cheaper (and it’s not a chain, it’s all snackbars run by private owners)
So there actually isn’t any need for Burger King or KFC or those things
Oooh I see, you got me thinking actual restaurants had drive-thrus
My image of it - that I get from watching American YouTubers - is: they get the meal, park the car in the parking lot and eat the food there
Or they eat while driving
The parking one is so sad though, please just go inside and get a table
Eating in someone elses car
I’d be angry af if someone would do that in my car lol
You always get crumbles in your car, unions or salad falling out of a burger (except if you have one of those McDonalds burger that barely has vegetables in it)
Eating a sandwich always gives you crumbles, since good baguettes always crumble
[Havenhuis in Antwerp] by Zaha Hadid
There is a lot of room for interpretation as to what is "good, modern architecture".
The "MAS museum" could fit in the collection, so does the "JustitiePaleis" Antwerpen-Zuid, even the "HavenHuis".
Antwerpen seems to have plenty of examples of bad, contemporary architecture
But I'm no expert
Come and see for yourself
Talking for Antwerp
It's controversial one
Plenty of people who are not fond of it
I personaly feel like they could've done a better job with someone else
I do like het [MAS] as a building by itself in Antwerp, though it does stick out like a sore thumb and does not really fit in the area IMO
The [Court of Justice in Antwerp] is also one of the more modern constructions, but it's straight up r/evilbuildings material
in regards to architecture it makes more sense to call it contemporary
It's less confusing imo
No i think it is fine the way it is now
I too have seen Zondag met Lubach
In all seriousness it was a very valid point
No need to make one up if we already have [our own
Sidekick
Standard issue FNC
Special powers
[Daddy's Royal Airstrike]
My god what a change on Philippes part
That's a long way from the stiff and awkward rake we se nowadays
Maybe we should get him experiencing some of those G-forces again and loosen things up a little
Sidekick for me would be a talking dog
No in my school they mostly focused on things that happened my country during ww2
It's mentioned when we learn about the period around WW2 yeah
[this is what belgian dominance over the continent looks like ]
Atomium
Or that floating staircase
Please fellow belgians help me
The atomium in Belgium is pretty amazing
I live in the city with the original Manneke Pis, but no one recognises this
The [city hall] of my hometown (Leuven) is quite nice
A few of my personal favorites:
Antwerp central station
, Port authority building in Antwerp
, City hall of Leuven
, Church of Ostend
, Church of Dinant
Yes but for us this isn’t some random statue
This is the most well known statue in Belgium
This is our national monument
"It's sterile
The station in Liege is also a cool station
I guess door-to-door salesmen and the enforcement officer
In België is dat 'die wandelclub met de paarse frakken'.
We'll share this one with our buddies in the north: Black Pete
Sometimes I forget that there are places in the world where euthanasia isn't ethically accepted yet
This sounds familiar
So Americans being Americans
Nothing special to see here people
Remember those girls kidnapped by Kony in 2012
Just 2 weeks earlier his group has tortured and burned over 200 boys from a school but not a peep was heard about that
True it has deffinitly blown up over there the last few years
Thing is, we can perfectly keep him without making his entire face black
That's why it should change
That comment about the elves is deffinitly one I'm going to use if an American decides to interfere in foreign cultures again
If you've been told since you were a child that he's black because of chimney soot then it's weird to suddenly change your mind about it
But yeah it's fucked up and I'm glad we're changing it
Ate fries 4 times in a week
I ate chocolate, waffles and fries and I drank beer all in just a couple of hours
>I purposely lightly touched like hundreds of tourists walking on the cyclepath as well
I visited amsterdam in january and rented a bike and did this as well
I felt like a local
My SO kept saying I was biking like a madman
... why not
One time frituur, 3 times side dish
Restaurants do that, yeah
But I don’t go to a restaurant 4 times a week, not even once a week
The average Belgian eats fries once a week
Italians don’t eat pizza 4 times a week either
Can you hold conversations in German
Do you live in Germany
Can you vote in the German elections
No, that is not at all what he is implying
Erdogan's biggest supporters live in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany
Turkish citizens have it really bad right now and many don't vote for Erdogan, yet he keeps winning, partly because Turks living in Western Europe keep voting for him without having to face the negative consequences
Democracy doesn't work if the voters don't face any positive or negative consequences
It's a bit hard to remember exactly, because I was still in primary school during the first wave of aids and the earliest years of testing or campaigns
But on the same time I was one of the first groups of children that grew up with the idea "you should use protection, that's really not a bad idea".
For a long time, it's seen as an infection for [i]them[/i]: mostly gay man, probably also a focus on our black community, drug users, prostitutes
It took a long time to grow out of that
And obviously the stigma here (for the first 15-20 years) was that AIDS was no more or less than a death sentence
Especially the gay part wasn't really a value judgement (in the eyes of my generation)
I mean
Freddie Mercury and some of the kids around the block who died of it were still seen as victims, not as "bad gays".
For me, personally, the first time my point of view opened up a bit was with the Philadephia movie
I really believe that that movie was pivotal in making people realize that there was more about it than blacks-gay men-prostitutes
It could happen everybody
Hah, I never knew that
I still hear a remix of that phrase at parties from time to time
I find Spanish to be the most beautiful language in existence
I like German too when spoken with a deep voice
But thats probably because I like Rammstein
Absolutely love Danish
Swedish used to be my favourite, but The Killing really swung me
I'd have to say Finnish is my fav foreign language
It sounds like someone is doing a spell whenever they speak Finnish, sounds amazing
I'm getting sick of Americans and their "lol surrender monkey white flag frogs" shit towards France because Chirac back in the days told Bush to go fuck himself with his Iraq clusterfuck
I also don't like it when people insult Russia as a country or the Russian people just because their government sucks
I'm Belgian
the france surrender jokes are way overdone and frankly an insult to one of the few country who managed to overrun more than half of europe
To this day I refuse to acknowledge the fact that PIGS is a real acronym
I though human-ressource was too on the nose but this is straight up an insult
I see little to less advantage of throwing that kinds of insults
If that's your kind of entertaining yourself, go ahead, but it says more about the people saying it than the other side
Iceland, because I really like the country
And Germany in case of war related stuff probably
It's kinda like how I get tired about the "British are prude and posh" stereotype
It's bullshit
I used to be in a British raiding party back when I played WoW and we had so much fun
They often did banter because I was "that Belgian mainlander" but it was all with the utmost friendship
Exactly
There are so many more jokes to be made about the French
The surrender ones just don't make all that much sense
I quite like Monty Python
It should be properly timed though, only when it's actually about the Spanish Inquisition, and just as a little funny side reference, and not all the goddamn time
My parents have 4 kids
My 30yo brother,  my 26yo sister,  19yo me and 17yo sister
When talking about me and my younger sister,  my parents always used to say 'de kleintjes',  which translates to 'the little ones'
They sometimes still call me ''spookje'' (Dutch) which means 'little ghost'.
My name is Casper
I think you can make the connection
I was called Robbedoes, which is a cartoon character from "Robbedoes en Kwabbernoot". My sister likes to sing "Robbie Robbie Robbie Robbieeee, nanananananaaa" to the tune of Ruby by Kaiser Chiefs
My irl name is similar to Rob, which is also how I got my username here
Mon poussin and mon chaton
Leans my duckling and my kitten
My mom used to call me a mix of my actual name and Duimelijntje (Thumbelina), I really don't know why though :p
My mom calls me lolotteke
Mix of French (lolotte) and Flemish (-ke)
My mother always says "our Connor" instead of just "Connor".
(Connor is not my actual name)
Some names get "our", others get "the". "The" is only used for male names
Vrolijke vrolijke vriiieeenden, vrolijke vrienden daaat zijn wiiijj
My parents called us de klein mannen ( the little guys)
In the Antwerpse Kempen, they say "de klei(ne) mannen" = de little men
The second syllable is dropped so it sounds like "the clay men".
I love how my little brother has 10 cm on me and he'll always be my little brother
This sounds just so wrong
Die is female and kleine is male
It's either dien kleine or die klein
btw i know officially 'die' is used both for male and female words, but half of the dutch-speaking people still use the gendered version of it
Are you from the Kempen
I bet they say "de klei mannen" with no N.
Now I think about it, my uncles also say "our Connor".
Incorrect

Nee dit is in (veel “dialecten” in) België zo
Dieje/diene grote, dieje kleine, dieje lelijke,... verwijst naar mannen
Gewoon “die” daarentegen verwijst naar vrouwen
zo een uitspraak maakt duidelijk dat je niet vertrouwd bent met de spreektaal in een groot gedeelte van het Nederlandstalige gebied
That's the way it is in 't "Aantwaarps".
Another example "die van ons" vs "dieje van ons".
Yep
I wanted to rehearse my German and it basically gave no info on the grammatical rules (nom/acc/dat
) even though it's essential
You're supposed to learn it by trial and error with Duolingo without any explanation; or you have to hope that the people in the comments are giving the right advice
well the standard language is based on the brabantian dialect
which makes even less sense for them to use that ughhgrgrgrgrg accent haha
Nepotism
Sigarettes
It’s unhealthy af and a massive cost for society
I was shocked when I visited Italy that there were cigarette butts everywhere
Yall have a serious littering problem
That too indeed
Healthcare, funded by tax money
It’s proven that the average smoker cost a lot more than the average non-smoker, due to illnesses they get from smoking
Alcohol is worse than for example weed so it makes no sense to make alcohol legal but to criminalize weed
[Article about the cost of smoking in Belgium]
> The social cost figures from the so-called SOCOST study show that smoking accounted for 727 million euros in direct costs in 2012 - doctor visits, hospital admissions and outpatient care
The patient takes about 10% of these costs for their own account, among other things via brake money, which means that 582 million euros are borne by society
The indirect costs, production losses due to diseases due to tobacco consumption, amount to 746 million euros, bringing the total social cost to 1
3 billion
That would mean about half a billion in "social benefit", but that is calculated without the intangible losses - the loss of years of life -, according to Van Camp and Hufkens
The SOCOST study calculated that in 2012 some 294,000 healthy years of life were lost due to tobacco use
At 40,000 euros, which, according to the European Commission, costs a lost year, one comes to the "hallucinatory figure" of 11
7 billion euros
If you add the social costs due to illness and disability to work and deduct the income from excise duties and VAT, the total cost of smoking in 2012 will remain more than 11 billion euros
The problem is that education doesn’t work
In the Belgian news yesterday: every day (!!) 6 minors end up in hospital because they drank too much
Then there’s also the hundreds of deaths caused by DUI
If education doesn’t even work when it comes to alcohol, how can we be sure that it will work with weed
Thank you, and my apologies on behalf of Belgium for this clearly mentally faded lad
pls move out of belgium
There are plenty countries where your dream state already exists,  in the middle-east for example
Alcohol shouldn’t necessarily be forbidden in my dream state, DUI should be forbidden in my dream state with a zero tolerance policy
I’m glad to move out of you think it’s okay to drive after drinking alcohol
That's a completely different topic though, you were clearly implying totally forbidding alcohol, weed, smoking, etc
We have werewolf, Diabolical Wolf, Saint Deer (with a Cross between the horn), a ghoul (Karmadog iirc),
Then we have faery (good and bad) who lives in the forest but also near the river
We also have Dwarf (Nuton)
**Lange Wapper**, a size-changing giant:
- Harasses drunks at night, first showing himself as a small figure, then growing ever larger and larger and chasing them
(IRL this would the shadow of streetlights growing larger and drunks mistaking it for a giant)
- Hides in baby cribs to steal breast milk, when found out he grows to such a size that he fills up the entire room
**Kludde**, a chained dog-like beast walking on his hind legs
Can take on other shapes as well
- Hides under bridges and in forests and harasses travelers walking past at night, announcing himself by rattling a chain
Once presented, he jumps on the back of travelers and forces them to carry him on their backs for the rest of the night
Come morning he disappears
Nuton is more of a kind of imp
Aside from living in caverns, it has more similarities with the Irish leprechaun in some ways : helps you and bring you good luck if you are nice with them, do some housecores/menial work
And can bring woe if you mistreat/disrespect them
They are very similar to the German Dwarf  , Imps are usually of demonic nature
Apparently it is
Never heard of *lutins* (imps/leprechaun) being demonic
Well Imp are not really helpful, Leprechaun are still mischievous (not helpful)
And most of our myth are similar to German one (we used to be closer to Germany)
You realize Santa Claus was based off of that tradition
But how else would you decorate your toilet room
I never claimed it was based ONLY on Sinterklaas
But there are simularities
Edit: reread my comment
I see the confussion there
Glad that I taught you something today
You don’t want to know the shitshow it’s been
:p Many people are extremely angry about it
In Belgium in particular, people feel as if we’re forced to conform to American sensibilities that are mostly irrelevant here
There have been countless polls among black people here, and almost none of them take offense to the way black pete is traditionally portrayed, yet we have to ‘modernise’ our tradition because how it looks internationally
Santa gives you coal
Yeah that might be the origin for that yes
Flemish people know about gender though
One sidenote: a neuter word in Dutch is not necessarily neuter in German and vice versa, for example, das Boot vs
de boot
(People might get confused with equivalent
Those are not articles, but personal pronouns
There are rules, but they are limited and many exceptions exist:  Anyway, I seldom hear native speakers get it wrong, but maybe it is not a coincidence the Flemish team used to win 'Tien voor taal' most of the time
Yeah we got taught the trick to figure out a word's gender
Whether you use "ne(n)" or "een" with a word
For example, you can use "nen auto" (a car) [masc
] but you can't say "ne kast" (a closet) [fem
I don't know why it is this way but it works
The definite article for plurals is always "de".
And yes, the ending changes, too
Whereas German has a whole truckload of different plural endings, Dutch is mostly restricted to -en or -s for plurals (with some exceptions, like 'kinderen' and Latin loans)
We do, but usually it's combined with a cycling network [(signs look like this)] In than case you may also find walking network routes [(sings look like this)] but these are less common, and you might find regular routes (either with their own sign, or with color coded signs)
Not really as you described
Daytime tv on (Flemish) public tv usually shows older movies
If it's foreign language movies, it is usually a) selected for their quality (having won an award or something) or b) Louis De Funès.
I liked Alert Cobra, it was a series but still it was German
I'm sorry you have to watch all those TV shows dubbed in German
Makes it even worse
Ah, Louis De Funès. Always reminding me I don't understand French as well as I'd like to
I liked the car crash
The Dutch stereotype that Belgians are stupid, despite the fact that statistically speaking, we have better education
Fits both categories
Funny since it's kind of ironic, annoying because it's utterly uninspired as far as stereotypes go
Imo the French people are the opposite of surrendering cowards, only the government could maybe deserve that stereotype
You're all construction workers and cleaning ladies
What about the ''muh belgium part france part Netherlands'' , that one is annoying as hell
And about the dutch saying you are dumb , here we Walloons have the same with the french ,even though you hear them say a lot of bs on tv
The french have the best military records in the entire history !
When we went to Italy with school one of teachers said that many Italians will refuse to wear shorts/general summer clothes until after Easter, at the earliest then even
We manage to form a governement !
Do we tho
Right now ? No !
But we had a government before ! And that's impressive for a country like ours X3
We already have a Monsieur patate so We'll pass X)

Father Damien - a catholic priest
He won recognition for his ministry in the Kingdom of Hawai'i to people with leprosy

He might've become the first president of Belgium if history had gone a bit differently
Nowadays he has largely disappeared from public knowledge unfortunately

Godfrey of Bouillon - leader of the first crusade and first king of Jerusalem
Adrien de Gerlache - Lead the Belgian expedition to Antarctica and was the first to winter there

He was also the first president of the UN general assembly and secretary-general of NATO
What a legend
My paternal granddather fought in WWII and was briefly a PoW
My grandfather fled from Congo during the Congo independence conflicts
A cousin from my grandmother's side did a suuuper extensive genealogy project and found some super old lines
I'm linked to a known and semi-famous [*Vlaamse Primitief*] and even older around 1100 there's some links to Danish nobility or something
I can't remember exactly
Most lines also gave location and profession
Nearly all of them from 1600 on were all in or around the town I live in now, still
Closer: great grandpa fought in WW2, got captured very quickly (because Belgium in WW2 wasn't really prepared for a blitzkrieg as you know)
Spent five full years in a Stalag, got sent to the hole, was forgotten for 14 days, took the uniform of a British pilot that died in the hole, got out
Was liberated by the Soviets in 45 (he weighed 28kg) had to walk back from the Czech-Polish border to Brussels where he was reported MIA/presumed KIA
Other grandparents had to house German guards in their farmhouse, mostly old and injured Eastern Front veterans who filled their days with strolling around the woods "patrolling" and playing cards
A US patrol checked the farm during dinner

The day of the week the Donald Duck magazine arrived was a great day, think it was Wednesday
We had hundreds of those comics at home by the time I could read as my sisters are older
They were the first thing I ever binged, hard
But letting 8y olds shoot a gun, on the other hand, is completely save and should not be made illegal no matter what happens
In Belgium you can choose between a license for an automatic car or a license for both
If you do the exam with a manual car, you get one for both
If you do the exam with an automatic car, you get a license only for automatic cars
I’d say 99% of the people do it with a manual car
Yeah I'm sorry about that
As someone who has just gotten his drivers license I just prefer to take public transport as much as possible because driving yourself is just a source of stress and constant danger
We use a lot of English words like they're Dutch
Like 'nice', 'fuck/fucking', 'shit', 'chillen'(to chill) etc
They're not English words anymore to us
Un parking = a car park, a parking lot
Here we use smoking and parking too
Though in American English they say 'Parking lot' so it's not that far removed from 'parking'
A smoking is an actual word for a type of suit fyi
Ah okay, I misunderstood the reply you made to the other guy then
>Actually the influence of English on our language make people put in spacing in words that should be a compound
This is called the English disease in Dutch
I’m not really familiar with scams in Belgium
But there is an Irish/British scam in France I know about
My boyfriend and I experienced it last summer (and then after this read about it online)
Someone comes up to you really desperate, it can be a family or just one person, with us it was a young man from Ireland
He claimed to have all his stuff stolen in Bordeaux
Someone allegedly broke into his car
We were just listening at that moment, a little hesitant
We asked what he wanted and it was money for a ticket back to Ireland
He showed us his car, but there was nothing with the car
He opened the trunk, still in despair
To show us the trunk was empty because everything was stolen
There were some children’s and women’s clothes lying around so we asked questions about his living and family situation at home and why he was in Bordeaux
He wanted to give us his number and name
We could even call his dad to check
In the end he also needed more money then just for the ferry ticket
He would give it back once he arrived home
But of course you will never see your money back
Ever
Never give in to things like this
Just tell people like this to fix their problem with the ambassy or the police
Here’s another example of people who experienced this scam:
Those guys were everywhere remotely touristic is Lisboa
A guide told to us they sold literal rabbit shit
But yours makes way more sense
Why would anyone be bothered to collect that much rabbit shit, put it in a bag and try to sell it to tourists
Is ‘une bouteille’ also good
I don’t know how to pronounce that ‘un pichet’.
Man, thats a story
In all fairness its seems like an odd place but i have a Belarussian friend who is nice
Seems like there is some interesting stuff in the country just not a typical tourist haven
Thanks
- Language education starts too late
The older you are the more effort it takes to study a language
- Language education doesn't focus enough on using the language, although apperantly this has been somewhat improved since I left school
- Primary school doesn't group people by their ability
Students who are better at a particular subject can't excel, while those that need more help fall behind
- Secondary and tertiary education should flow into each other better
Students who know what they want to do should be able to hop into tertiary education quicker
Overall I think it could be a lot worse, I think the education system does most people well, I think fixing these four issues would result in massive improvements
Education in Flanders: heavy focus on learning French, German, English and optionally Spanish
Education in Wallonia: Do you want to learn English or Dutch
Sorry you have to choose one of the two
Oh woops
Seems like our school doesn't have any Dutch teachers
So English is good
>Language education doesn't focus enough on using the language, although apperantly this has been somewhat improved since I left school
I'm in my last year of high school now, and just this year and last year they started focusing more on using the language
Also: I'm Flemish and I have 3 hours of French now, and I think everybody has French untill their last year
Apparently in Wallonia, the last 2 years of high school you can choose if you want to get Dutch (which a lot don't want)
I think that's stupid that they don't learn that much Dutch when it's one of the main languages of the country
Yeah it's so stupid they get to choose for dutch when they become 16 while we are obligated to have 3-5 hours a week of french sometimes starting when we're just 9 years old
9 years
I started getting French when I was 10 or 11 (5th of primary school)
Although we did listen to some French songs and learned 'Bonjour' in the 4th year
As similar as you expect from a place that received Dutch settlers for over one century (the 1700s), but was then taken over by the UK 200 years ago (1814 -  )
It's a people with some inherited characteristics from respectively their Dutch, French, and British mother countries
From the Dutch they got their religion and language roots
Note that Afrikaans as a language is also spoken by a very large (larger than the white Afrikaners) ethnically mixed local group variably called Cape Coloureds -  (who are protestant too), Cape Malay -  (speak Afrikaans but took Islam along from Dutch Indonesia) or Griqua (mix of local Khoi with Dutch) -  . I can't go into the nuanced differences and similarities between white Afrikaners and Cape Coloureds
That's a novel in itself
From the French they received their wine-making expertise, but all the French settlers became Afrikaans-speaking
Still a lot of people have a French family name like *De Villiers*, but they pronounce their own name in hard Afrikaans (pronouncing all the letters of the word - DE VI-LI-JEERS, not like in French DE-VILJEE)
French pronunciation: First five seconds of this clip: "Bonsoir Philippe De Villiers, Merci
" -
Afrikaans: At second 10 of this:
From the British they got their tea drinking habit, and a fondness for cricket and rugby, but the British are seen more as oppressors while the Dutch never were seen as oppressors
That's also a novel in itself
Because of the isolation from the 'mother country', several  characteristics were frozen in time
Afrikaners are still majority practicing Reformed Protestants, most of them as member of the NG Kerk (Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk -  )
Afrikaners are more religiously conservative while the Netherlands became strongly secularized along with the rest of Western Europe
Dutch opinions on abortion, elective euthanasia, soft drug use, acceptance of atheism are foreign to (most) Afrikaners
Besides the deep British influence (as mentioned: tea, cricket, rugby), you'd have to add a big sprinkle of what Europeans would call "American" traits
- They do their shopping in large shopping malls
- They drive everywhere, even if it's one street over to a neighbour
- They have a historical culture of gun ownership (although the SA government gradually introduced strict registration laws on gun ownership)
- Contrary to Europeans, Afrikaners fall much more on the "privatize it"/"it's your personal responsibility" spectrum when it comes to education, healthcare insurance, or pension insurance
As a consequence, South-Africans pay through the nose for their private schools (if they can afford it), private healthcare plans (as in the US offered by the employer if you're lucky), and private saving for your pension
- And the Evangelical brand of Protestantism is also seeping into South Africa
NG Kerk calls them "the happy clappys".
True
I didn't want to go too deep into why you drive everywhere (the distances are larger for starters, plus it's a lot safer), nor into the complicated reason why affordable social security (healthcare, education) is not really an option because the high unemployment makes it so there actually isn't a big enough tax base to fund it all
As you know that opens up the can of worms of the sorry state of S.A.'s public healthcare
(By the way, I'm married to a South African and visit frequently, so it's how I picked up these nuggets about S.A. over the years
Steamed chinese buns
My recipe wasn't the best but I was still surprised by how good they were
Went on camp with my youth group in Hungary
We stayed in a random small town, and an old lady made us a huge pot of goulash
I don't think we got any more Hungarian than eating grandma's authentic goulash with your feet in the Danube
Liege waffles are a bit too touristy I think
We only made waffles when we had too many eggs at home
But vol-au-vent and stoofvlees are regular and absolutely amazing dishes
Stew is always good but I have a soft spot for my own country's ones :)
Same
We went for Georgian food a lot in Kiev, it was heaven
The country is definitely on my to-visit list after that
I like em now too but they take quite a while to make but I read you can after steaming them freeze them and later microwave them so if you can make enough in one go it's probably a lot more interesting
Our old garden used to have a fuck ton of cucumber plants
We always ate em raw as snacks, gave them away, ate them with every meal and still we had too many
So we made cucumber soup
It wasn't bad, but raw was still better
Nothing to do with the meaning of the flag
But our belgian flag has been unconstitutional since the beginning of our country
The constitution discribes it as 3 horizontal lines, but the flag is allways and everywere presented vertically
Altough i think they changed it recently
It sounds like a joke but it isn't a joke
For me, it's the red next to the black
The gold should be there to separate the two
It's more balanced this way imo
Also uncommon ratio's get extra points in my book
Some of these posts are made by bullies
It's not a game if you can't get hurt but others can
"Striptease ball game" - You had to stand in a circle, your legs had to be spread and your left and right feet had to touch the feet of the children left and right of you
You had to try to make a "goal" by kicking a ball between someone's legs
That other person had to prevent this by kicking the ball away with one of his legs
If you lose (when someone makes a goal between your legs), you had to remove a piece of clothing
You were not allowed to remove your underpants or shoes
Socks and shirts and pants etc
were all allowed
"Who is afraid of Big Bertha
" - You had to stand in a line on one side of the field
One person is standing in the middle of the field
He is called Big Bertha
He shouts: "Who is afraid of Big Bertha
" Then everyone else shouts: "NOT MEEEEEE
" and tries to run across the field
Big Bertha then tries to lift someone up
Then there are two Big Berthas etc
Eventually only one child remains
The game ends when even he gets lifted
That's belleke-trek in Belgium, and knock-down ginger in the UK
Sounds like "bundle

I don't think Charleroi is that well-known
Their airport is even called Brussels South Charleroi Airport despite being 70 km from Brussels
It could be surprising but many people know Bristol

That it takes a looong time to really befriend a Belgian
Don't get me wrong tho, once you have a Belgian friend, you have one for life
But I've heard about people having a difficult time befriending people here
Why though
Spanish, along with most regions of France, are some of the nicest, most laid back people I know
And Spanish people absolutely love it when I at least try to speak Spanish when on vacation over there
I thought the stereotype was that no matter who is president, you're always gonna think he sucks :)
I can say that the stereotype of "Frenchies being rude" is untrue though
I always feel welcome in France when I go there on vacation

Apparently we are seen as distant and serious and a little dark (humour wise - it's the flag, isn't it, or is it Congo
In all seriousness though I think it's because of that little sentence branded into out culture: "Denkt eer ge spreekt
" (Think before you speak)
Belgians tend to hold you accountable to what you say
(Which is, amongst others, why all other political parties tell the racist party to go fuck itself here)
During the hot days this summer(like 35+°C) we just left our construction workers home
They're not working in those temperatures, period
Yeah, that seems logical
I've seen a video of Americans visiting Belgium and one think they thought was really weird is that Belgians stare a lot
Which is true, I guess we like to try and see what kind of person he or she is
(Also, when 2 Belgians like each other in let's say a club, they will stare at each other first to make sure they both are interested, I can confirm this btw)
Well, that's the thing, we appreciate such honestly :D (As long as it's not rude ofc)
We have our fair share of austists I guess
Our constitution dates back to 1831, but it has changed a lot since then
We have had 6 big State reforms from the 1960s to 2010s. That's about one every decade
These reforms transformed Belgium from a unitary country to a federal one
Now basically everyone agrees that it's a mess, and a new very large State reform is planned for after the 2024 elections
The process to amend the constitution is the following:
- The government and a simple majority in parliament must agree on what articles of the constitution to modify
- Then new elections are called
- The new parliament has to agree to the amendments (only to the articles that have been opened to change) with a 2/3 majority overall, and at least a 50% majority in each linguistic group (French and Dutch speakers)
In order not to call new elections all the time, the parliament usually votes on the articles to modify at the end of the legislature, right before the elections
So the next parliament has the possibility to make amendments without calling new elections
My girlfriend is French and pronounces it as ski-well in English
In Limburg they say einbiegel
Ain-beegel like a bit German
Anybody know where it came from
Eekhoorn= eek+hoorn
As a native French speaker, I can confidently say that I can't confidently pronounce it
That word is impossible to pronounce for me
If I had to say it, I would substitute something else for it, like "small animal" or something
It's absolutely the r sound
It's a sound that doesn't exist in French and while I have learned it, sometimes, it trips me up and I think it's probably the fact it's between two vowel sounds, not entirely sure
Actually, I'm good enough at English to not have a French pronunciation like that but it's just one of those words that just trip me up
The English r doesn't exist in my language
I'd say that counts as unusual enough for it to be hard to pronounce
I honestly don't know
There's just something about it
I know it's the sounds that surround it that make it difficult for me to pronounce, but I don't know why
Yes, I can, just not together
Belgium doesn’t recognize Palestine as a state, which is pure bullshit imo
It's so dumb
I always thought a lot of countries didn't recognise Palestine untill I saw a map of it
It's basically just Europe, the US and Canada that don't recognise them
Palestine is recognised way more than Kosovo
Weapons is a difficult issue though
Wallonia here in Belgium sells a healthy amount of weapons too and a non insignificant part of that to the Saudis
But if we didn't sell them weapons, what do you think would happen
Countries like Russia will fill the vacuum and get the profits
So not only would our moral stand barely make a difference in terms of access for the Saudis, we'd also indirectly be sponsoring Putin and allow him to expand his influence
All in all, I don't like the fact that we sell weapons to Saudis but I'm pragmatic enough to realize that it's our best option right now
>Where do you draw the line then
I don't know
I'm no expert at geopolitics
>It's either all or nothing
That's a false dichotomy
You being in the EU means you decide what the EU tells you
>It is all or nothing
You keep saying this but you give no actual argument as to why that is
Why can't Belgium (for example) decide to sell to the Saudis and not to North Korea
Should North Korea sue us because we're breaking some law
Note: I'm not saying I'm against selling weapons to NK either
I'm simply disagreeing with your "well if you sell to X then you are obligated to sell to everyone" logic
Feel free to explain to me where I'm wrong though
> You say you're not d'accord with selling weapons to North Korea because the state there kills people who do not obey
I never said that I am against selling weapons to NK though
No entrance exam here
You have a secondary school diploma
You can enter any university you want, no elitist and selective bullcrap here
No such thing as entrance exams here except for medical stuff
You finish high school, you go to college
The end
Culture is I would argue really laid back when it comes to what you're talking about
In high school you can as years progress make more and more choices, by 11th grade we're talking about hundreds of options
Everything from car mechanic and electrician, to sports, IT, languages, science, etc
Now you take that knowledge if you want to college and just start there
I did an IT direction, very math heavy for obvious reasons
One of the first classes for my economics degree was financial algebra
I didn't have to study a lot at all for that class because of my background back in high school
So again, no matter the degree from high school, you can begin nearly everything
But that doesn't make it a good idea
My financial and math/IT background means that to succeed in a language aimed one I would need to do some studying for a year just to catch up
Upside: You're busy more with the things you prefer
Making that what you wish to do easier as it's spread out over more years
Not having to study financial algebra meant I had more time with some other classes, though again, many of the first classes were repeat for me
Downside: harder to change midway through
While I did IT I had to change schools that didn't offer it
I had to study 4 years of German to get my degree for economics, something that wasn't given when I took IT
Though harder, it's of course still possible
So most "private tutors" at a college level will be people trying to improve what they want to get into or people who want to switch what they want to do and need a new basis to have an easier time succeeding
My uncle did languages in high school but wanted to go into banking so he took private lessons to get his math up before starting college
But it's rather rare
Except for medicine
If you want to study for doctor or dentist, you nees to do an examn and only the best x people can start
Yes, you can start studying medicine just by applying
Why couldn't you
Why would there be a need of a selection process
Anybody that has a secondary school diploma can do that, unless he/she has a professional/vocational secondary school diploma, that is, one that teaches you directly a job
The idea of doing anything STEM related and not being able to speak English is kind of odd
I did IT in high school and the English teacher was very blasé, assuming we knew English
The guy who spoke French at home(Algerian family) actually had a lot of issues with it because of that
In Flanders you have an entrance exam for medicine, though
Yes
Maybe it's different in Wallonia though, idk
But I doubt it
That may very well be in Wallonia-Brussels Federation too, but it is likely one of the only very few ones where it is the case
Wallonia doesn't have an entrance exam
It has been a point of contention between the Flemish and Wallonian regional accreditation departments for several years now
Oh wow that's... weird
It's mostly a matter of further education opportunities
For specialising their are only limited spots
So in Flanders they made a selection exam, so students who finish their studies can, with reasonable certainty, find a specialisation and a job
In Wallonia students are more likely to have worse job prospects after graduating, because there are more students starting, than there are available spots, and they more often have to go abroad to finish their education
I place them in the fridge, but supermarkets just store them at room temperature
Language (Dutch VS French)
Which beer is the best
Most of them are great god damn it, you're wasting time arguing which could be better spent drinking beer
Frieten, it's called a frietkot, not a patatkot
If u say patat you have mental problems
>According to it's protesters, it is a racist version of blackface
Early stories definitely speak of a "kroesharige neger" and "den zwarten knecht" so it's hard to argue it's not racist
But there's an easy solution a lot of places employ here in Belgium, not sure if it's the same in the Netherlands
Zwarte Piet is just portrayed with smudges of dirt on his face instead of full black face
That makes sense if the explanation is that he enters through chimneys
Both people who think it's racist and people that want to preserve Zwarte Piet as a concept should be happy (unless they specifically think the fully black face is necessary in which case they're likely just racist)
Not really we call mashed potatoes just "purree"
It's potatoes prepared in a particular way, no need to specify what it's made from, same stuff why you don't call a steak "cow steak"
Jij connais die /r/BELGICA sprache
There is no "Belgian" language
"Flemish" is very close to Dutch and the "Belgian French" only has a few subtle differences with "France French". And there is "Belgian German", but it's a really small area of the country
Guess you could also call them frietuur, still, frietuur not patatuur
Why would you say patatzaak when it's obviously called frieten
I guess you're right
Is this song also a tradition on weddings
Here in Belgium it's always played at least once and people start swinging their napkins around
Scandalous
Herman van Veen is fantastic
That's so weird because I'm Flemish, and it's obviously a French song, but I've not been to a wedding where it wasn't played, song's a lot of fun though
I have never used a train internationally, the cost is too high to me (money and time wise)
If it became cheaper I definitely want to take the train more
However I do try to avoid going somewhere on a plane, I'd much rather drive there
I love driving to holidays, you have the freedom to go where you want, when you want
This is not possible with either train or plane
Also the drive itself can be so fun, putting on music while driving along beautiful sceneries
I love it
My choice between the train of a plane is seldom made for time or cost reasons
I must add, I travel most of the time between Antwerpen and Toulouse, or Agen
Flying means you can hardly take any luggage, which on top of that does get "lost" once in a while
The flight to Toulouse (from Zaventem) will take roughly 6 hours in total
On the train, I take a large(r) suitcase and some hand luggage without a problem
TGV train to Toulouse or Agen takes about 10 hours in total
For longer distances and short (business) trips, it's almost certainly going to be "flying". All I probably have/had with me is/was another shirt/suit, toothbrush, undies, laptop
For longer trips and holidays, I typically rent a car, so I can take whatever luggage I want, go where I want, when I want
We should create an EU wide train company and have the Swiss be in charge of it
And since the Swiss aren't in the EU we can't claim they're biased
I'd say that would qualify as a car ride
Thanks to watching Scandinavian fiction I understood your two comments
I'm not saying it doesn't help
But a lot of it (when written) is quite understandable
I speak (Flemish) Dutch indeed
English reading is "perfect", speaking will always have some sort of accent
I can read and understand enough German to know what a sentence is about or get the gist of it
Speaking and writing, not so much and I should actually take it up again
I like the sound if Scandinavian languages/North germanic a lot
Except for Danish as it indeed sounds like a strange bastard between yours and whatever is going on
Would actually love to learn Swedish/Norwegian
French movies: the accent
Other movies: well they don't really portray us
For some reason, Hollywood is convinced we all speak French
We don't. More than 60% of the population speaks Dutch
We're not portrayed often, but when we are, movies tend to give the impression that we are mainly French speaking, even though the majority has Flemish/Dutch as a first language
They even do this when they are in Flanders
Zurich I'm guessing
About siestas, the region I went to multiple times, they definetely had siestas in the surrounding villages, shops (maybe except that one supermarket) closes from 2pm to 4pm (ish, it has been a while) but stay open until 10pm, it was a surprise when I walked about 6km for a pharmacy that was close in the afternoon
Thanks for the input
Siesta was the first thing that come into my mind, not the midday nap
But rather a "resting time"
If you live in Belgium and can't ride a bicycle, you're probably disabled
I can, I think I was 5 or so when I learned it without the side wheels
I was 4
Everyone here knows how to bike, except for my dad maybe
He was already too fat when I was 5-6 so I've never known him to ride a bike
He used to though
Yes I can ride a bike, probably started learned very young
Can't put an age to it, first as a todler I had the [mini plastic todler bike with four wheels] or the [three wheel bike] those were just for around the house
Then I guess between the age of 3 and 6 I started with a normal kids bike with two extra support wheels in the back until the time came that my dad decided I could do without
&#x200B;
In Belgium it's super normal that everyone can ride a bike
At least in the countryside it is, but I assume in the city too
I know one person who couldn't really ride a bike, he learned it as a kid, but because he never actually did it (probably for 10-20 years) he kind of forgot how and had to learn it again
But that's honestly the only Belgian person that I know of that couldn't ride a bike (and I think now he can again and he did actually learn as a child)
I grew up in a cul-de-sac almost so I was basically on wheels since I was like 2
Learned it without side-wheels when I was 4-5 I think
Don't think I know anyone that can't ride one
Disabled people and such, immigrants
Riding a bicycle, swimming, reading, knowing the the sun is a star, etc
are all things I assume an adult knows and can do
And if you live in the Netherlands you're probably a prick anyway
The Dutch and their "humor"
Honestly, the Roman empire could provide one of the best stories
There's war, there's scheming, conspiracies
Basically play EU 4
That will do the trick
Dutch people are called de kezen, de kazen , roughly the same as the cheeses because they are known for making cheese
Hehe, that river's name means fart in French
I think you mean 'kaaskoppen'
Who doens’t like some good old Gouda boys
We learned about Hitler trying to get the power and failing -> going to jail and writing a book -> his party becoming popular and Hitler becoming the leader -> WW2 and Holocaust
Here they say it started in 1940, because that's the year belgium got invaded
The flemish loves to remember the battle of the golden éperons ( not sure how it is translated in english), the moment where they murdered the french army because the french can’t pronounce « schild and vrienden »
In wallonia Nationalist like ... Idk they aren’t really that much nationalist, but probably the strong monarchy and the pre-WW1 period
That time in the 14th century that we as a bunch of farmers defeated the mighty French army
Do germans celebrates Luther ?
Which is funny considering Flanders as we know it today and Flanders in 1302 are 2 very different regions
Belgium: duck, quail, pigeon are readily available in supermarkets and are not uncommon in restaurants
Goose is limited to foie gras, I've never seen actual goose meat for sale
Turkey as well
It's very good meat actually
Tastes amazing
Yes they are, the dish is also forbidden as it was seen as animal cruelty
Haha no I haven't. But if I remember correctly, the dish is supposed to be eaten with a napkin over your head
Charleroi is called the ugliest city in Belgium, and even of entire Europe
Did you know you can book a safari through Charleroi
Even if you are blind en deaf, you can smell the ugliest town of Europe
Only for masochists and the obsessed of the real ugly:
Charleroi in Belgium is often considered the worst looking city
It's juts like of many cities that heavily relied on coal
A lot of wallonian cities:
Charleroi  elected the ugliest city in Europe, Liège, Châtelet, La Louvière which  has a large urban canker still not rehabilitated for a dark conflict  between the city and a developer, Seraing, Mouscron, Verviers, Louvain  la Neuve (a new university town with lots of concrete and no charm)
For  most of the cities mentioned, the industrial past, the economic slump,  the total lack of architectural cohesion and the fact that the wealthy  locals who never want to live in the city center explain this without  speaking of the Mosan art which I find quite enough
ugly
In Flanders the towns are much more beautiful but Genk and the seaside resorts are also hideous though
This one surprises me
Looking at pictures, it seems somewhat nice
It's a good song
A Dutch-language cover of it (Zoutelande) was huge in Belgium and the Netherlands
When I speak Flemish, I get mocked for having a French-ish lilt, and when I speak French, I get mocked for the Flemish tone
Oh the bane of being a Brussels sprout
I was living in France when I was 15-16, and they seemed very amused with the way I said the word "huit" (8)
Not really know, I'm from the part of the country which speaks the standard accent you hear on TV and radio (Brabant and French-speaking Brussels, formerly part of the same entity)
Thus, we would be the ones doing the mocking I suppose
Yes, I'm from the province of West-Flanders
1)In our accent we basically pronounce G's as H's and H's sometimes a H's and sometimes we leave them out
So we're known for not being able to pronounce G's, or not being able to pronounce the difference between a G and an H. This is very confusing to others
2) The infinitives of verbs in Dutch end on -en (pronounced like 'un'): dansen (to dance), zingen (to sing), lopen (to run), etc
Many regions (both in Flanders as in the Netherlands) just drop the -n at the end: danse, zinge, lope
But West-Flemish people drop the -e: dans'n, zing'n, loop'n,... (using a glottal stop)
This sounds apparantly very funny to others
In general we're known for having an accent and dialect that is super difficult to understand by others
Also the entire province has the image of being the countryside full of cows and every West-Flemish person is a farmer, harvesting potatoes, we barely have electricity/internet/... and out toilets are still outside
&#x200B;
As a student I studied in Ghent (province of East-Flanders), some differences and funny things were pointed out
But Ghent is full of West-Flemish people (students and ex-students who didn't leave) so overall they're quite used to it and it's not too big of a deal
When I was a student in Antwerp (province of Antwerp) it was a way bigger thing; there are also way less West-Flemish people there
First of all communication was more difficult
But on multiple occasions I had people laugh with my accent because they thought it was funny
It wasn't really meant in a mean way
But sometimes it can be quite annoying if a conversation is interupted because someone couldn't answer the question because they were noticing how funny my accent was and didn't actually listen to what I said, or they were laughing (not out loud, more on the inside) so they couldn't immediately reply
As a West-Flemish person I am very aware of the fact that I pronounce certain things wrong, I'm pretty sure almost all West-Flemish people are aware if this
But it did quite bother me that on a few occasions when I was talking to a person in Antwerp and I addressed the fact that Antwerp people pronounce their vowels wrong (said with no ill intentions, just as part of a discussion about pronunciation/accents) they denied it, said that I was wrong, total disbelief
I kind of felt like they didn't take my opinion on the matter seriously because of my West-Flemish accent
While pretty much every West-Flemish person is aware that we pronounce certain things wrong, apparently Antwerp people don't necessarily all know about the flaws in their own accent
Don't misunderstand me, I've met Antwerp people who did know, I just feel like less people in Antwerp are aware of their own pronunciation shortcomings in comparison with West-Flemish people
I also don't mean this as hate towards Antwerp or people from Antwerp, I had a great time there and I think the people there are just about as friendly or unfriendly as anywhere else
It's just something that bothered me
This one I never get, how different is Belgian *huit* from French *huit*?
It's only the Flemish that will be under water, here in wallonia it's Okey ^^
- *Comme même* ("like even") instead of *quand même* ("when even") (*quand même* means : still/anyhow/anyway/even so)
- Mixing up *c'est* (that is) and *s'est* (indicates the reflexive/pronominal form of a verb)
- Mixing up the *-er* (infinitive form) ending, *-é* (past participle) ending and *-ez* (indicative present, 2nd plural person) ending
The dreaded dt-error
The [d/t error]  is a killer in Dutch,
Damned final obstruent devoicing
But honestly, I don’t get why people keep making this mistake
It’s not like it’s irregular, you just have to follow the rules
When in doubt, use the verb ‘smurfen’.
Oh yes
How could I have forgotten it

Social security is not linked to nationality but to where you contributed to the social security
So if an French person comes to work in Belgium, he will contribute to the Belgian social security and thus be eligible for Belgian social services such as unemployment, healt insurance, pension etc
If he moves back to France and continues working there, he will still be eligible to receive a partial pension from Belgian for the time he contributed there
If you want the official source:
You can actually [put articles in Google translate] and share them that way in other languages

I had never seen that many huge buildings in one place
Especially this walkway thing that was up in the air and between buildings that I don’t remember the name of

Apparently the grid system is the worst possible option for traffic flow
I always laugh with the Quebec translation of the movies, for example in France or Belgium Cars stays Cars but in Quebec it is named "Les Bagnioles" what literally means the cars but with a more familiar word
And a totally different example the trilogy The Hangover is named Very Bad Trip in France and Belgium (yes it stays in English) and the Quebec translation is "Lendemain de soirée" which literally means "the day after the party".
Here in Flanders movie titles are normally only translated for Flemish-dupped movies, which only exist for kids and family movies, and even then it doesn't always happen (Cars, Frozen, Onward)
If you are going to watch the English version, the name stays the same
Most translation I know aren't that funny but rather accurate, except for one
A bug's Life (which is mostly about Ants) is named "Een luizenleven", which literally would translate to "The life of a lice".
However, "een luizenleven" is also a proverb for "an easy/comfortable life".
Not from my country since we almost never translate titles or dub, except for children's movies, but I now that Home Alone is "Maman, j'ai raté l'avion" (Mommy, I missed the plane) in France
For some reason, iirc, the Disney movie "Treasure Planet" was called "Schatten planeet" in the netherlands, a direct translation, but in Flemish it was called "Piraten Planeet" (guess what that means)
Not sure why
This is funny xD
Meh, some theft but that's it
My laptop, car stolen from my parents, car broken into while on the beach in France
Obviously bike stolen several times, most of the times we found it again
That's about it I think

Here is a song from Wallonia (Belgium)
This is from the "Ti T'chapias" wich means "little hats". The song is about drinking typical Walloon beers
[Ti T'chapias - Vive la Wallonie]
"Gestapo Knallmuzik" has top hits in pretend-German, it's basically Dutch with German pronounciation and intermittently some small German words, like [Angela Merkel] a "love ballad", or [Heel die Tag Pörno] or [Claudia Schwiffer]
I apologies to all German speakers for this
'Zeil je voor het eerst' and 'De Marie-Louise' by Bart Kaëll
Anything from Samson & Gert  (but mostly 'Ochtendgymnastiek', 'Samsonrock' and 'Bij de Brandweer') and Plop ('De Plopdans')
For the people from Antwerp: Katastroof, mostly known for 'Met de wijfen niets als last' and 'zuipen', but also for 'Dansen met de Paterkes' en ''t bed van tant' Janine' ([for the Dutchies]
[this] song its about going home with some woman but suddenly she has a dick and you don't want to be rude so you fuck her rough in her hairy ass
Probably [Angela Merkel] or [Kachelwinkel Peeters] by Gestapo Knallmuzik
It’s flemish people singing in very bad German, and it’s honestly fantastic
Well, even though it's pop/commercial music, I like some songs of Stromae
Also anything from boef and Watskeburt from de jeugd van tegenwoordig
Its about not being able to have sex whit a girl cuz she is 17

don't forget the most famous dutch meme, g e k o l o n i s e e r d
Shaking hands is a formal thing here in Belgium -> first meetings and the like
Or if you meet somebody at a party(I'm mainly thinking about business stuff here)
So not a regular thing with the same person
Say a colleague doesn't get more than a greeting
A hug seems more gay to me than a kiss on the cheek, I mean it's just your cheeks touching, you don't put your lips on them, that would be weird
Lol I understand what you mean by double shake
I'd feel fine hugging both men and women too but that's more intimate to me
It's like actually putting your lips on someones cheek, you don't do it when you meet but when you're celebrating or something
I can't imaging meeting my friends and hugging them lol
I've had dogs, cats, rabbits, kangaroos, horses, donkeys, all sorts of birds, from the small little twerps to big parrots and chickens, goats, sheep, all sorts of fish, etc
over the years
Currently about 100 chickens since April or something, 1 cat, 3 dogs and a pond of Japanese koi probably worth about 50k.
I'm allergic to both cats and dogs
Very annoying I tell you
I'm allergic to both but dogs look so much nicer than cats, even though I'm kind of afraid of dogs
I don't walk my cat, but during lockdown when there were no cars, my cats decided that they were going to join me on walks
They quite often just walked 2 kilometers about 3 meters behind me while yelling constantly
Love them goofballs
I remember something like that but it was further explained that people usually have 2-3 cats while for dogs it was closer to 1 or 2
We used to live in the center of a block so if you followed the path you would end back at our house
When we walked the dog our cat would follow us jumping in front of the dog as if taunting him that he wasn't on a leash
When washing the car we would often see the dog leaving on one side of the house and a bit later arrive at the other side
I'm a weird one in that case I guess
We have 3 dogs and 1 cat at the house
Two dogs for the parents(the calm ones), one for my sister(dancing/agility dog), cat is mine(brittish shorthair, calm one that crawls on my back when I'm sleeping sometimes)
Belgium has officialy 3 languages  dutch, french and german
Nobody knows where these german speaking belgians live, nor have we ever encountered one
For years there are stories about people that have met them
Some believe these stories others  believe they are myths
We got quit some dialects that aren't spoken anymore and our German community is also pretty small
We have other languages too though
Walloon is still spoken by a couple hundred thousand people, making it a larger language than German in Belgium
Other regional languages are mostly dead or almost dead
Living in Limburg I sometimes hear some Limburgish from other people
Officially it's classified as a regional language based on Dutch, but it's just as similar to German
Different versions of Wikipedia in languages spoken in Belgium, so you can easily compare them:
- [Dutch]
- [French]
- [German]
- [Walloon]
- [Picard]
- [West-Flemish]
- [Limburgish]
- [Luxembourgish]
These are all officially recognised native languages in Belgium which have their own Wikipedia
A lot of them are endangered or at least losing speakers as time moves on
Languages like Luxembourgish are spoken in only a few communities in Belgium, but more common in other countries
Dialects of Dutch, French or German were not included, but especially Dutch has a lot of strong dialects
Belgium only recently embraced its language diversity
In the past it was keen to classify different languages as dialects of French or Dutch, and forcing people to study those instead
Especially Walloon suffered from this
Although it still has a good chunk of native speakers, they're mostly growing old
The language has been nearly completely wiped out in favour of French
The languages spoken in the North have adapted to the Dutch that the speakers were made to study, becoming gradually more similar to Dutch
I could be wrong, buy isn't there a language called Northumbrian in Northern England
Don't forget the dialects of West-vlaanderen
I feel like Flemish we have some of the most extreme dialects in Belgium
Like if I go to Aalst I'll just give up on understanding people
I think it was from one of your earlier visits
Picard(chti is a synonym) isn't a dialect nor a patois it's its own sister language, the fact it is called patois comes from the francisation that made it look like it is inferior
Provençal on the other hand is a dialect , but from the occitan
Edit: The situation of Picard is the one of many other languages in France , like walloon , occitan ...  Unfortunately
Ja jongens jullie en Oost Vlaanderen zijn de enige die nog dialect praten
There's so much detail missing
I didn't mean to say Belgium recognises them, only Dutch, French and German are officially recognised by Belgium
For instance Limburgish is recognised and funded by the province, cooperatively with our friends over the border
Sadly, our Flemish overlords keep wanting to take away our right to do these things
The European Union also officially recognises Limburgish
Wallonia and the Netherlands have a much more reasonable language policy
Yea he was joking I think, because the comment he replied to was also joking
Wat ? Mij uitmake voor een west vlaming, Trots gentenaar hier hahha
>  I just checked some texts in [Picard] and I understand everything so yeah, it does sound like a dialect now
It does because it comes from the same continuum dialectal and are from the same language family
Furthermore, you've probably seen a text in "picard" in the french litterature sense , which is french litterature **but with words coming from local languages** ( there are examples with provençal and champenois, or even anglo normands), which isn't Picard as of the language itself
That or you've seen a ''bastardized'' version that is more commonly spoken today because of francisation incentives from the french government and belgian alike
(probably option 2, as there is mention of 2016 in your link)
> Do you know some versions of picard without francisation ?
No unfortunately , as i'm not a picard , and even after having searched , i could only find [This] which is medieval , but isn' easily readable
> They make a confusion with gallo, a french dialect from the East of Brittany (my grandparents speak it)
Gallo has not as much consensus than picard , but it seems that it's more considered a separate language too

So basically what I learned here is that nobody knows which exact countries form the Balkans regions
If you count Greece as a Balkan country, there's no reason not to include Turkey
Greece is in the Balkan peninsula, so it is fair to include it
Istambul can be partially included as it spans over both sides of the Bosporus, but wether or not it can be seen as the most important city I would say depends on whether the whole city is said to be included or only the part on the Balkan peninsula
Which part is the most important
As I think it's only fair to count that 60% as Balkan city
Depends on the definition, some definitions of the Balkans specifically exclude Greece
??????! Really
You don't think of Mainland Greece and Turkey as Balkan
I have never been there, so I was waiting for someone to confirm this
So thanks
If the most important part is in Thrace, then yes, in the global sense  Istanbul is the most important Balkan city
Not sure if it is the most important city for the Balkan countries though
I don't think of Greece and Turkey as Balkan either, I think of Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, and suchlike
In Dutch we speak of the Balkanschiereiland = the Balkan peninsula
This makes it impossible not to think of Greece and Turkey as Balkan
It wouldn't be a peninsula without them
Yeah, I know
That was just my question
Yes, apparently
I live in the historical center of a city which had it's height in the 15th century, so i'm surrounded by buildings ranging from back in the 1400's all the way up to brand new
Most of them were build between 1500 and 1900
My grandparents used to live on an old farm and my father found some Napoleonic coins in the garden when he was young
You'll probably find sth if you're lucky and search long and hard enough with a metal detector
If you'd visit Antwerp (after the Corona crisis), it'll be worth it to visit the underground parking site on the 'Leie' where a piece of the Spanish bastions/wall is visible
Now a project also integrated more of it in a park and car tunnel after being buried for over a 100 years
[The Spanish fortresses] were built by order of Charles V in 1542 - 1553, when Antwerp was the largest city in the Netherlands and was threatened by the northern rebellious provinces
Later, a citadel was built in the 16th century under the rule of Philps II and the Duke of Alva
In this pentagonal citadel the soldiers resided who had to keep the city under control in these barracks
Note that most of it has been demolished in 1895 to free the city for it's expansion
Nevertheless are the remaining bits very interesting

a friend of mine found a canadian ww2 gas mask in a field a while ago, most stuff older then that is pretty rare
Same in Belgium
In the area of the WW1 front, and in the rest of the country as well, unexploded artillery shells are found frequently
Many farmers have died after hitting an obus with their plough
I learned practically nothing about the EU in high school
I did learn about the different institutions and their functions in my last year of elementary school though (given that I was 11, this was obviously on a pretty basic level)
I'm in my mast year of my Master's in law and specialised in International and European law, so I do understand how it works now
We have what we call 'campus cards' that anyone who uses the train to go to school can get
It is one large card you have to get from your local train station once and then you attach a smaller card to it that allows you to take the train 5 times back and forth between your home and your school/university
Costs around €12 per small card
Only valid for trains unfortunatly and not for busses or trams
Some people also say 'een, twee, drie, spaghettiiii' here
Diepvrieskieken van den aldiiiiiiiii
Lmao how could I forget about that one
I don't think I really get offended by anything, but I do think it's quite annoying when people just think they can solve all our political problems two seconds after I met them
"Clearly you're country seems disfunctional
Why don't you guys just split up
One part to the Netherlands, one part to France
You're a fake country anyway
It's a bit more complicated than that mate
See nobody here is really patriotic about Belgium (except for when it's football, I dare you to laugh at Manneken Pis then), but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who wouldn't get annoyed if that's one of the first things you bring up
It's always those type of people who think they're an expert on the country because they watched some 10-minute YouTube video about it
I had a Romanian friend one who told me that a common question was if people would still support Ceaușescu .
I mean wtf who asks such questions
No, it's part of Denmark : p
Another thing people forget to do in France: when a shop employee or whatever greets you with "bonjour".... have the decency to answer with "bonjour"
People in France say "bonjour" much more easily than i Belgium, but it's important that you reply to them
Do people still do this
Asking any of that is the last thing that would go through my mind when talking to Germans
I want to clarify that OP doesn't take offense to these questions ( I think) But just says these are common questions
I don't think Belgians are easily irritated about such things ( bcs fries are fucking great )
"Omelette du fromage"
&#x200B;
Just no
to answer that question i never heard, yes there are people who regret those times
you could say they are supporters of him, i guess
It's not rude
I'd even say it's very nice to show enough interest to ask what region someone is from
We don't expect foreigners to know about Brussels being a small separate region
Or that there is a small German region as well
As different as standard American English and standard British English
No baguette fromaga
Dutchmen rarely use the word Vlaams
They call Flemish people "Belgen" and they call Flanders "België". But indeed, they sometimes use it when talking about Belgian Dutch, but I think they would just as often say "Nederlands" instead
And every person in Paris is carrying a baguette
So poor Sweden is hated by everyone :(
Well, who needs them anyway
Sweden has the nicest sounding language :p
Klapt vloams jong
For some obscure reason, they say 'Vlaamse friet
That's true
Oh yeah, that's right
But they also say "Franse friet". Is there a difference between Flemish and French fries
Maybe Flemish fries taste better
Aiai dan gon kik toch alles een vitess oger moete luistere
I am standing right here all right
Danes are not very nice :'(
They also tell Flemish people their language is ugly right in their face
Not specifically from my country
In short
**Global progress has saved millions of childhoods
since the year 2000**. There are:
• 4
4 million fewer child deaths per year
• 115 million fewer children out of school
• 94 million fewer child laborers
• 11 million fewer married girls
• 3 million fewer teen births per year
• 12,000 fewer child homicides per year
And a list for those who like: what countries protect their children the best
Singapore
Sweden
Finland

Belgium
[This cute little giraffe was born yesterday in Bellewaerde Zoo, Ypres]
Well I don't know about the rest of Belgium but in my town they're gonna start using silent fireworks so animals won't get scared
I also just now learned about it but man I'm so glad it is a thing
This index scores 8 factors
* Under-5 mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births)
* Child stunting (% children aged 0-59 months)
* Out-of-school children of primary and secondary school age
* Children engaged in child labor
* Adolescents currently married or in union
* Adolescent birth rate
* Population forcibly displaced by conflict
* Child homicide rate
So in this index, poverty indicators are valued more than pure medical indicators (for which there are data available); other indicators aren't included because data about it wasn't available, like for sexual violence and trafficking
But Singapore just does very well on all these 8 indicators
On the same line with other countries in the top 10, but with significantly less teen mothers
Longest without a federal government, twice I believe now
Brussels is the most international city (most languages spoken) after Dubai
Belgium has the first Geocache on the Afro-Eurasian continent
Though that's probably very interesting if you aren't a Geocacher, haha
UNESCO declared our fries to be Cultural Heritage and our Beer Culture to be Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity
We are going for a new record this year
That's the weirdest church tower I've ever seen
It just looks like a big barn
Seems like fun hidden tourist spot though
We're bound to overtake that record quite soon
The new bicycle facility underneath Gent Sint-Pieters train station is set to have 17 000 bicycle spots
That is if the works ever get finished of course
Given the historical precedent, my money's on the German
I know how this is going to end, someone from "vlaams belang" or "ptb/pvda" wins and the other parties going to say "sorry no extremist didn't you hear about cordon sanitair" back to zero
There's An emergency government, and they figured out some limited Powers somehow
Plus, there's always the flemish and walloon governments and probably a few other government of equal power stuck between the couch cushions or something
From Half As Interesting
I... I... I don't think we need any more bombs from Germany
No more fries
Belgians would cry at this loss of our cultural heritage
If what vanished
Never heard of that
EDIT: just googled it, apparently, it's some sort of vegetable
No more fries
I think our whole nation would collectively die from heart attack
We'd just invent a syntheticly created potato
I ain't giving up my fries that easily
They can take our land, use it to settle their own gross battles, but NOT our fries
I've heard that pumpkin is a possible alternative, only problem is that I really don't like pumpkin
Mitraillette masterrace
Thank you for that glorious invention
I made good use of it during my studies
I love bread which is why I've never visited the US
I've heard stories of the bread wasteland that is the US
Didn't notice in Ireland
Was too drunk to notice I think
I mean over here people go super crazy and drunk about cycling and cyclocross, but luckily it hardly ever gets violent
Which has to be the most outrageous thing to have happened at a korfbal tournament
Ever
The fuck
What did they do to deserve that
A fucking korfbal tournament
Was it like, an accident, or did they actually get into a fight
Yeah, cycling is a surprisingly peacefull sport (for the fans) for how big it is here
No you're right
It's more about the individual cyclists and the countries they're from, not really about the team they're in
Belgium would be complaining about fries being Belgian and not French
We would all be complaining about the english guy being drunk and annoying again
We'd hesitate between all the options and finally end up choosing an incoherent mix of different dishes
We would hate the taste but wouldn't really complain too much because we asked for it
Belgium will sit on the prestige table with the other founding members of the EU and a glass of our best beer, while the kids (Eastern europe) are fighting over the food
Netherlands sat down at 17 and finished eating at 17:15
Dinner at 19 is late
18 is fine
Otherwise Belgium is happy but really indecisive
Those silly Wallonians
Welp, there he is
drunk off his arse and spouting some bullshit again
The disrespect
My blood is boiling, I'm shaking with fury and I just punched my pillow
Not only in the alps, the low countries (Belguim and The Netherlands) also eat at 18
Sorry I don't drink water, only beer
The Eighty Years' War
I had no idea the "south" (modern-day Belgium) was also involved in all of this until I read about it on Wikipedia
One of the most famous battles, the Battle of Nieuwpoort, was even set in Belgium and (apparently) is a well-known thing in the Netherlands
I guess they don't teach us that in school because it's something Dutch/"un-Belgian".
In high school we didn’t learn a lot about how and why we got independent from the Netherlands, and what country we formed before that (de Zuidelijke Nederlanden)
I’d have loved to learn about that in high school, luckily enough I had a history course in university and learned it there :)
How the Duchy of Burgundy had such an impact on modern Belgium and The Netherlands
How reading one book can open a lot of eyes
Nearly all of Belgian history
We have no history lesson about our own country
Also that Belgium was already independent in 1790 (I think), this only lasted for a year but still
The country was called 'the United Belgian States' although in Dutch it's translated to 'Verenigde Nederlandse Staten' (United Dutch States)
The country was unrecognised but it was a republic
It's teached in school nowadays though
We learned about this at school
Apart from that Ceasar said that Belgians were the bravest of all the Gallians
Sadly most teacher forget to say this was just a marketing stunt of him to brag that he defeated the bravest Gallians, even tho we were just some regular folks
Eh, that was not my case
I had to learn the whole monarchy history
I liked the part where leopold III was a pussy during WWII /s
Yes, de Bourgondiërs by Bart van Loo
He also has a podcast where he talks about it for 8 episodes
Really interesting (his main focus is Flanders of course)
yeah, it seems it really depends or the school or the teacher
The entire run might actually turn out as long as an average Belgian government formation
True, but so boring at the same time
Dubbing is the worst, I can't watch it
If I don't understand the language I'll just use subtitles
Dean is the Dutchman with the questionable fashion sense who just likes visiting
We didn't go into shutdown for 500 days
Shutdowns don't even exist here
It was a lame duck session of 500 days, not a shutdown
The previous goverment stayed in charge until the new government was sworn in
People hardly even noticed it
I remember when I was in Thailand, my school had some old reader's digest from 1993 that mentioned that the Czech couldn't agree on a name and had decided on Czech Republic as an interim name
Well, I mean, technically stuff like holocaust denial is banned right
So there are some opinions you can be fined for expressing (if not simply for having)
There's a thread about that on r/europe right now
Got all the usual suspects: r/T_D posters, brand new accounts, no-flair accounts, and American flag accounts
80%-90%? Looks like I'm moving north
To be fair, you have to admit the two favorite go-to smears Russian propaganda uses when someone criticizes the motherland are: “They’re fascists” or “They’re gay”.
I know
And we're not the only ones seeing that
I sometimes read about people who have been on reddit longer that r/europe used to be better
Is it just lackadaisical moderation that made it go to shit
Some of the threads over there, especially if you dare go into *new* once in a while, are downright scary
I hover over accounts sometimes and see that these posters are often very new (a few days/weeks) or are obviously American, but still, it's quite scary the amount of upvotes some comments straight up arguing for ethnic cleansing get
I can agree with that
There is a big difference between what Russian propaganda puts out, and whether people believe it
Especially young and traveled Russians will know it's all bullshit
But I distinctly remember during the Ukrainian revolt that Russian media first went with "they are degenerates and homosexuals", and when that didn't work (because how could homosexuals be so brave
) they went with: "Oh, they're all fascists, didn't you know
And some of those stories stick
I wonder how many Russians know the far right only got about 5% during the last Ukrainian elections

133 and further
I found a pirate copy here:
> In November and December 2013, the Russian media covering the Maidan introduced the irrelevant theme of gay sex at every turn
When covering the very first day of protests by Ukrainian students in favor of the association agreement, the Russian media sought to fascinate its readers by conflating Ukrainian politics with handsome men and gay sex
**A social media page of Vitali Klitschko, a heavyweight boxer who led a Ukrainian political party, was hacked and gay material introduced
Then this was presented as a news story for millions of Russians on a major television station, NTV
** Before Russians could apprehend that pro-European protests were underway in a neighboring country, they were invited to contemplate taboo sex
> Right after students began their protests on the Maidan, **the Russian television channel NTV warned of “homodictatorship” in Ukraine
** Viktor Shestakov, writing for Odna Rodina, claimed that **“a specter is haunting the Maidan, the specter of homosexuality
The fact that the first and the most zealous integrators in Ukraine are local sexual perverts has long been known
**”
> Dmitry Kiselev, the leading figure in Russian television media, warmed to the theme
[...] He is the director of a new media conglomerate known as Rossiia Segodnia, or Russia Today
[...]
> On December 1, 2013, the world press reported the beating of students by Ukrainian riot police the previous night
As Ukrainian students huddled in a church tending their wounds, Kiselev found a way to formulate their protests as sexual geopolitics
That evening on Vesti Nedeli, recalling to his viewers the Great Northern War of the early eighteenth century, he described the European Union as a new alliance turned against Russia
This time, however, **Kiselev claimed, the Swedish, Polish, and Lithuanian enemies were warriors of sexual perversion
** Poland and Lithuania were not in fact enemies of Russia in the Great Northern War
Getting one’s own history wrong is essential to eternity politics
> In another episode, **Kiselev expressed his delight to have discovered a magazine with a nude photo shoot of Klitschko from a decade earlier
** On the set, Kiselev stroked the black riot gear worn by the Ukrainian police as the camera zoomed in
Meanwhile, the **newspaper Segodnia breathlessly praised itself for publishing a photograph that framed Klitschko together with a gay Ukrainian writer
** In the Ukrainian context, these were two activists at a press conference
In the Russian press, the sexual orientation of the one and the male beauty of the other was the story
> European integration was interpreted by Russian politicians to mean the legalization of same-sex partnerships (which was not an element of Ukraine’s association agreement with the EU) and thus the spread of homosexuality
When the German foreign minister visited Kyiv on December 4, **the newspaper Komsomol’skaia Pravda headlined the meeting as “Gay firewood on the Maidan fire
**”
Continuing:
> The Night Wolves found concise ways to translate sexual anxiety into geopolitics and back again
As a male-only club devoted to black leather, the Night Wolves naturally had a strong position on homosexuality, which they defined as an attack by Europe and the United States
A year later, celebrating the Russian invasion, their supreme leader Alexander Zaldostanov remembered their proud parade around Crimea in this way: “For the first time we showed resistance to the global Satanism, the growing savagery of Western Europe, the rush to consumerism that denies all spirituality, the destruction of traditional values, **all this homosexual talk**, this American democracy
” According to Zaldostanov, **the slogan of the Russian war against Ukraine should be “death to faggots
”** The association of democracy with gay Satan was a way to make law and reform foreign and unthinkable
And if the gay scare doesn't work, just call your opponents nazi's:
> On March 16, some of the Ukrainian citizens of Crimea took part in an electoral farce that the Russian occupiers called a referendum
Prior to the vote, all public propaganda pushed in the same direction
**Posters proclaimed that the choice was between Russia and Nazism
Next page:
>  In the same spirit, **Alexander Prokhanov, speaking with Evelina Zakamskaia on Russian television on March 24, blamed Ukrainian Jews for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—and for the Holocaust
> This was a new variety of fascism, which could be called schizofascism: actual fascists calling their opponents “fascists,” **blaming the Holocaust on the Jews**, treating the Second World War as an argument for more violence
> Russians educated in the 1970s, including the leaders and war propagandists of the 2010s, were instructed that “fascist” meant “anti-Russian
” In the Russian language it is practically a grammatical error to imagine that a Russian could be a fascist
In contemporary Russian discourse, it is easier for an actual Russian fascist to call a non-fascist a “fascist” than it is for a non-fascist to call a Russian fascist a “fascist
” Thus a fascist like Dugin could celebrate the victory of fascism in fascist language while condemning as “fascist” his opponents
> **Ukrainians defending their country were “junta mercenaries from the ranks of the Ukrainian swine-fascists
**” Similarly, a fascist like Prokhanov could describe fascism as a physical substance that spilled in from the West to threaten Russian virginity
In June, **Prokhanov wrote of fascism as “black sperm” that threatened “the golden goddesses of Eurasia
**” His lapidary expression of racial and sexual anxiety was a perfect fascist text
Glazyev also followed the schizofascist protocol
While endorsing Nazi geopolitics, he set a standard for calling Russia’s enemies “fascist
” Writing in September 2014 for the Izborsk Club, **Glazyev called Ukraine “a fascist state, with all the signs of fascism known to science
”**
It goes on and on
So maybe the Russians don't believe anything of this, as you claim
Might be, I don't know
Still, the pattern of the rhetoric is clear: the enemies of Russia are either gay or fascists
[Bart De Pauw] used to be one of the most popular TV personalities over here, but in 2017 it was revealed that he had been harassing female colleagues for years
His contract was immediately terminated, and you don’t really hear from him anymore, except for his trial which is supposed to start in a few weeks if I’m not mistaken
That, and then some other male celebs made headlines a few months back because their nudes got leaked after they sent them to someone who claimed to be a woman but turned out to be just some dude
It was really big news for two or three weeks and then it just blew over, so it’s really not *that* interesting tbh
You forgot my way by frank sinatra somehow being used as a funeral song
like wth
Do people even losten to it
Not the American way but 10 days or 2 weeks of boy-scouts camp is fairly usual
Same here I think
It used to be every 6 months but because everything is always fine I go every 9 months now
I used to go every 1-2 year but now I realise I haven't been to one in like 2
5 years
But everything is always fine
If it starts hurting I'll go again
In Belgium, there's a system where you get paid back more when you visit the dentist regularly than when you don't visit often
The standard is twice a year
Also, it gets more expensive if you don't go once a year
Mutuality/ziekenfonds doesn't pay back as much of the cost in that case
Yup, that's why I go once every year
Dentist also sends out a reminder so I won't forget to make an appointment
Belgium is a small and (often) insignificant country, so I don't expect anyone to know its history
If I had to point one thing however, it is the little known fact that Belgium was actually an industrial powerhouse in the 19th century
The first country to industrialize on the continent, the second in the world after the UK
The per capita GDP (PPP) was continuously in the European top 3 from 1830 to WWI
That Flemish cities as Bruges and Ghent (even Ypres and maybe Antwerp) in the period between the 13-15th were seen as the richest/most powerful cities north of The Alps
> I met quite a few people who didn't know the emperor/kaiser was elected
Maybe is it because the election lost its importance during the few centuries of continuous Habsburg rule
We aren't even thaught about Congo lol
Well it's just mentioned and my teacher said some bad stuff we did, it isn't even part of the curriculum
Yeah, I figured that people would learn about that
This is why I didn't mention it, because it doesn't meet the requirement of the question: "surprised to learn was **not** taught in other countries
Yeah but it's not like the king chopped off all those hands
>Your king was kind of a sick psychopath tho
Nooooooooooo, what do you mean with that
He didn't do *anything* wrong
Officially the death penalty was abolished only in the 1990s, but we barely used it
The last executions were performed on Nazi collaborators in 1950
There also was one execution in 1916 (we borrowed a guillotine from France, because didn't have any of or own anymore)
The last execution in peace time was in the 1860s.
Well, the expats in Brussels all seem to live within their own bubble
Which makes me think we must not be the friendliest
We are friednly and neutral towards anyone
But don't expect to make a Belgian friend, that is equally hard for a middle easterner than it is for a German
Is Belgium seen as former Spanish territory, since we were part of your empire from 1549 to 1715
Depends on the employer for us
in my case I recover it as a bank holiday that I can use whenever I want until 2022
It just gets added to the pile of vacantion days I can take
Officially no
It's a workday
But in practice employers will offer an extra vacation day as compensation
Mine give it back to us the 14th of May (So 4 day WE)
Mine gives it between Christmas and New year, we always have a week off between those two
i shower 2-3x a week when the temperature is cold/moderate
when it's hot i shower every day
I do; we have a pizza cutter/wheel, but scissors just work better and faster
Amazing, you might have admitted to blasphemy greater than fruit pizza
I use scissors and everyone here looks at me like I'm crazy too
Burn the witches
Flavius Claudius Julianus, labelled/called "Julian the Apostate" by Christians
Because he simply tried to save the Empire from the cultural and spiritual destruction brought by Christianity
Christians were basically killing, torturing, force-converting all non-Christians; they were destroying ancient temples, burning literature, doing everything they could to destroy European historical and cultural religions, in order to have only one religion, one way to think, one way to live
They destroyed our cultures, philosophies and spiritualities
Had Julian lived and his successors continued in his path, European cultures and religions would probably still exist, without the destructive monopoly of Christianity
Unlike some previous emperors, he didn't violently persecute Christians, he simply tried to reduce their influence and take-over over everything
With him, maybe Pagans and Christians would have coexisted, there would still be alive continuous European religions, instead of only Christianity and a church killing, persecuting or force-converting all non-Christians for centuries
1) Hadrian (all the obvious reasons)
2) Didius Julianus, because my man straight bought his way to the throne
Didn't end well, but still
I live in Antwerp,  which means that I look down on the rest of the country
I think we also mostly laugh with the 'slow' Limburgers and West Flemish who can't pronounce "muggengeheugen".
''Muhhehheheuhen''
MA HOW SEH
We don't want you on our roads
I don't know if you noticed but Flanders has actually started investing a lot in roads
Just look at [what they plan on doing in 2021]
Stomme kut
Met vriendelijke groet
WEST-VLAANDEREN
In the western flemish dialect the letter G is pronounced like an H, so the word muggenegeheugen (mosquito brains) becomes  something like  Muhhehheheuhen
I would think the cinema industry are concentrated in near Canne
Brussels,  Antwerp and Gent
Antwerp is the city,  everything else is parking space :)
By municipality: Antwerp, Ghent and Charleroi
By agglomeration: Brussels, Antwerp and Liège
Though everybody seems to go by municipalities except for Brussels
Going by municipalities in Brussels is ridiculous
You might as well go by Antwerp's districts
Just like when talking about London, we talk about Greater London, not London City
Same with Paris and its separate 'arrondissements'.
It's Brussels, do you even know how big Brussels is
But you're right about the municipalities
The vaccination against polio is mandatory here
I’d fully support mandatory vaccinations for the ones on our basic vaccination chart (vaccinations for deadly diseases) since *only* 93% is vaccinated with those, which honestly doesn’t seem like a lot to me
Usually yes, but not for all of them
Kinda means the same no
Quite similar to the German Wilhelm
I visited Bulgaria and I was pleasantly surprised
The cities are really beautiful and really green as well
And the Bulgarian landscape can be breathtaking
Flemish people like to talk shit about Wallonia, but there are some amazing cities and small towns and the Ardennes are the only real nature we have here
We have Last Friday Lunch where I work
Every last friday of the month we have lunch together with all the departments/companies in the building on the company dime
This is about 70 people and each department/company takes their turn organizing it
Lunch can be a local caterer who comes on site, pizza delivery, a food truck, etc
It's also totally normal to drink a few beers and/or have some wine with your lunch
It's a nice break we all look forward to and a moment you can relax and talk with your colleagues and management
We haven't had a LFL in over a year because of Covid and I really miss it now that I think about it
hopping here to say that for example in Romania you're the one who has to host(aka pay) dinner for your guests while in Belgium, where i live now, it's expected for your guests to cover the bill
Or buy you a cake or viennoiseries
My boyfriend recommends Noordkaap (for example "Arme Joe") as band that sings in Flemish
He knows a lot of good Belgian rock/metal bands but they all have English lyrics
CPeX
Clement Peerens Explosition
He sings in Aantwaarps, a universal language
Metal I would say the only one that sings Dutch/Flemish consistently is called Fleddy Melculy
Amenra has a song which is called "Terziele
Tottedood
" which has lyrics in Dutch/Flemish
If you go to just general rock music, there's some things like Gorki and Noordkaap
But my guilty pleasure would be De Kreuners then
Their biggest hit is called "Ik wil je" (I want you) and is a staple at drunk parties
Except de boeren don't understand it
Leopold II
Yep, came here for this, but also an honorable mention for this title: Yves Leterme, for thinking we were France smh
He made Belgium great, don’t get where the insanity would come from
Stalin the second
Chad the mad lad
He didn't rule the Congo, he *owned* it
It is the first and only private colony ever
What he did in Congo was nothing short of atrocities
And you have to be a special kind of evil or fucked in the head to commit such atrocities
Technically not since ethnic cleansing was not the intent or cause of death (less than 5% of the deaths in Leo's Congo were violent deaths afaik)
But merciless exploitation on a scale that rivals the largest genocides
Absolutely
Some could argue that it's even worse
Mate, a genocide doesn't stop being one because it was only partial
The essence is that people were lined up in the desert to die because they were Armenian
Let's not deny history because of nationalistic pride and let's call a spade a spade
As you see the Kingdom of Belgium has done even worse, yet almost nobody here denies the nature or the scale of the atrocities committed in the Congo
Because what the Ottomans have done *fits* the definition of genocide
The guy who coined the word even had that particular event in mind among others
"Genocide" isn't some sort of rank on the Scale of Badness
It describes how things went down and the intentions that were behind it
What Belgium did is in many ways worse, but it doesn't fit the definition
So what hypocrisy
Marc Dutroux, he kidnapped 6 girls and put them in a basement and sexually abused them
(he kidnapped 2 girls, three times)
He killed 2 girls, 2 starved to death and the 2 others were found
Another famous case is the one of Andras Pandy
He was Hungarian but lived in Belgium
He killed 6 of his family members
Don't forget the Cassis de Dijon case, ECJ
Especially the argument that a higher alcohol % is beneficial for your health
10/10 for trying lol
Also, the Dutroux case induced the police reform
And Andres Pandy made his family members disappear in destop
Actually his wive let the 2 starve to death
He was in jail (for something else than the kidnappings) and he asked her to feed the kids
She went to the house to feed the dog but not the kids
She's a monster too
She's already released from prison
Welcome in Belgium
Not a single person in the Benelux seems to know what is the utility of the Benelux
You know alot but I'm gonna  smooth some edges, if you don't mind
>I know that Belgium has administrative division, based on ethnicity
It is language based, ethnicity isn't really part of it
North Belgium (Flanders) is majority and officially Dutch (Flemish), Walloon (South) is French speaking (historically Walloon)
Brussels is an enclave in Flanders and has it's own government, just like Flanders and the Walloon each have one
On top of that each language communty (German, Dutch and French) has their own seperate government (But in the case of Flander and the Dutch speaking community those are one and the same) and we have a federal government which gives us a total of 6 governments and parliaments
>Belgium has 4 (?) official languages
3: Dutch, French and German in order of most spoken (only arround 3% speaks German as a mothertongue iirc)
>Netherlands and Luxembourg have three (?)
The Netherlands has 1 language that is official in all provinces, and that is Dutch, but in Friesland Friesian is an official language too
On some colonial Islands they have English and Papiamento as sort-off official languages too
Luxembourg is correct (Luxembourish, French and German)
I feel Liège probably isn't the best city for visiting pretty architecture, or classy people, although I've only heard from others
(Aside from Namur I've only been to wallonia in passing)
edit: I forgot I go to the Ardennes a lot (they're really nice if you want to stay for a while with a group in a cozy house and do hikes
It is a pretty big central city but possibly a bit far from the ports for it to be as effective as other options
That's not really locals though but people travelling through because it's notoriously cheap there
We prefer not to think about it too much
It sounds so European to accidentally drive through another country
Our women are made of sand too
Only the Dutch can be difficult when it comes to financial matters
I've no idea when Belgium or Luxembourg ever made a lot of a fuss
> Brussels is an enclave in Flanders
Historically, Brabant isn't Flanders though
Brussels is what remains of a genuine Brabant
Before the 90's, both Brabants weren't considered either Flemish nor Walloon, and before the "Flemish movement', Limburg and the province of Antwerpen weren't considered Flemish either
Limburg was its own cultural thing, Antwerpen was a part of Brabant
And Brabant has a distinct history from Flanders
It's the perfect example of anarchy
I hate sand, it coarse and rough
And it gets everywhere
Walloon,  and [many others]
Yeah, but in terms of "officially" we mean the administrative languages etc
Otherwise West-Flemish, Walloon, Picard, etc
would count aswell
I went on a trip in Dutch Limburg a while ago
I didn't know the language existed, so when I heard someone speak it, I was confused af
At first I thought it was a dialect of German, but the more I heard, the less German-like it became
I legit thought they were speaking some made-up language with a bit of Dutch and German in there
That's probably how non-benelux people feel when they hear someone speak Dutch or Luxembourgish
Yup, correct
But I hope you see that I was talking about the current day region of Flanders, which surrounds the region of Brussels, instead of the different midieval county of Flanders
that's fun, I'd definitely recommend Bruges and Ghent, I really liked visiting Bruges and occasionally go to Ghent during the Gentse feestdagen, it's a really nice atmosphere
If you like churches then you'd easily find Them in Maline aswell (though as a person who's lived there all her life I may be considered biased)
I'm from Liège, the city is not great but it's fine I guess
They're far away from everything not Luxembourg tbh
Are the cargo ports connected to the port via railway, waterway or road
Because if it's road that's just dreadful
Otherwise I'd be strongly in favour
Don't worry, at least 3/4 of the Belgians also don't understand all the governments, and even just the structure and functioning (as if
) of the overarching federal government seems to be lost to many
The institutions here are just really strong which is why the country just keeps functioning even after a year and a half without a government
I just mean in general but that specific deal is probably what it's all about yeah
And you're right that they have the right to be sceptical
Something like this is giving and taking, compromising
Limburg and West-Flemish
Walloon, Picard and many more
[West-Flemish get subtitled by our own goverment
Yes, but that's not what an official language is
That's a recognized language, both Walloon and Picard are examples of that in Wallonia
I'd say Antwerp is a bit of a mix between the old and the new, it's nice just a bit more modernized, I'm sure there's some nice places though and I've visited a few art shows there that were really nice, definitely recommend looking up some of those
Baarle-Hertog/ Baarle-Nassau is a very interesting place and pretty good looking as well but keep in mind that it's just a medium sized village with lots of farmland around it and not some kind of tourist hub
I live in Belgium right on the border with it
Still interesting to see it with your own eyes though
I knew it was that video as soo as I read your comment ;)
Antwerp is really nice to visit as well yeah
Maybe more variation then Brugge or Gent but with possibly a somwhat smaller historical centre in comparison
In Dutch (Belgium ):
- **singular**: dankuwel
- **plural**: dank jullie wel
Don't forget "dikke ciaoukes"!
In our area it is only used when starting to drink a beer
Wouldn't people in the Netherlands also prefer "dankjewel" for singular
There are honestly so many ways to thank people
and the totally Dutch word 'Mercikes'
There are like hundreds of ways to say thank you
I had to narrow it down
Maybe because you live in Switzerland
But we mostly use 'danku(wel)' for singular and plural
That's the shortened version
Kind of like "thank you" and "thanks" but without much of the casual connotation
Dankuwel is more of a Flemish thing
People don't like to use 'je' here
It sounds unnatural, to me at least
It doesn't mean good in Dutch
It most commonly is used as the negation of a negation, I don't think English has such a word
- "Why didn't you do it
- "I _did_ do it
Becomes:
- "Waarom heb je dat niet gedaan
- "Ik heb dat _wel_ gedaan
However, several centuries ago it did have the meaning of being well, in the sense of well-being, being happy and healthy
That meaning isn't used today except in this fixed expression
We use 'u(w)' instead of 'jou(w)', 'je' would be 'ge'. 'U' is still formal if it's used as the subject of the sentence
I mean in een unformal context
Dutch is pretty much halfway between German and English
Yeah I didn't mean to be exhaustive in my answer
That said, "hij heeft er wel tien gevangen" and especially "wil je wel eens nadenken" sound like they come from the Netherlands
You wouldn't hear "wel" being used in those ways here
"Hij heeft het wel geprobeerd" _feels_ like it's the same meaning as the double negation, but I can't describe it well
Translating it to English, it becomes the same stressed verb
"He _did_ try it
Le petit prince
Its a French book that Flemish students are supposed to read for French class
We didn't have one book we all had to read, we were given a list of books written (mostly) by Dutch and Dutch-speaking Belgian authors, of which we could freely pick for books report and the likes
AFAIK, no world literature, which is a bit of a shame if you ask me
I'm frankly under the impression that it's whatever the hell your teacher likes to be honest
Education in belgium is very liberal and divided, we have directions issued by the gouvernement(s), but those are minimumgoals it’s up to the teachers and schools to add their own touch
Also the communities (flemish, walloon and german) have their own minimumgoals and stuff, thatns why walloons aren’t forced to take dutch classes, but Flemmings are forced to take french classes
Anyone can start a school here, everyone can choose what school they want to attend and follows their values
It’s just that your degree will only be accepted and will only receive subsidies if you accomplish the minimumgoals
The freedom to choose your school, and start a school are constitutional rights
Who now cause a little uproar after the Flemish gouvernement made new, very specific minimumgoals for our schools
To make it short, there is no list of books we have to read
The teacher or school decides or just lets us choose
Also, les miserables
Is it easy for a modern Greek speaker to understand ancient/classical Greek
IIRC correctly we are one of the few countries hammering so hard on grammatics and way less on literature
I have never read anything from Shakespeare, Don quichot or whatever
Wherever literature we read is on the teachers discretion
I had to read les miserables, one part each trimester
But for some reason we never got around to reading the third part
So I've read 2/3 of les miserables, which is somehow worse than reading the full thing
Never read that one and only graduated 4,5 years ago
Actually, we didn't have to read any classics at all
Oh that's cool
I didn't know that Homer was that far off from classical Greek
I've read excerpts of both language variations in the original language and I didn't really see that big of a difference, but I guess that's just because I've never learnt modern Greek
Stuff I can't live without is a lot different from stuff I can't travel without
There is only one thing I really need and that's my \*\*\*\* crossword puzzle --no-block, no-bar style--, a pencil, an eraser
So outside the usual suspects (roof, electricity, water, stove, pantry
Live :
* my 30cm razor sharp chef's knife : how on earth can I cook anything if I can't do some cutting first
Travel (basic stuff being passport, credit card, water bottle, smartphone, sunglasses)
* nothing really
There are quite some Germanisms I regularly use
Autobaan - Bermerking - Technieker - omkleden
I love the word überhaupt (and sowieso)
Fingerspitzgefuhl is one of my favorite germanisms
>For example, for some reason, instead of jogging we say "footing".
We say that too in French !
Not that uncommon, but also not 'in fashion' atm
I thinks it's mostly grandparents that have issues with it, and occasionally a judgmental employer (but they would be legally in the wrong)
I have long hair, it's quite uncommon and somewhat frowned upon in professional circles
I've been told I can't have long hair in a professional sales role for example (like account manager or something)
It is not very common
You see it from time to time, but in many cases, it is associated with being fan of metal
I don't pay attention to other peoples hair honestly
5% maybe
Nobody gives a shit
Go see your union, they shouldn't say that to you (I know, easier said than done depending on your contract, but you have rights here)
Eh, it was at a first job, I was doing a junior role at a bank, trying to figure out what career I wanted to pursue, and asked my manager in confidence whether she thought I could promote to account manager in a year or two
I much preferred her honesty there, it made it clear to me that I don't want a job where I always need to have 'the right look'.
Honestly, I prefer a clear explanation
Otherwise I would just vaguely get denied a promotion for 'not being a good fit'.
It's actually an interesting point: what if there's something about you (not just talking hair, but say race or sexuality) which an employer finds problematic (cause they're a racist or whatever)
They obviously can't tell you outright, but they can still deny you the job on some vague grounds
Wouldn't you rather know what the reason is
Disclaimer: I don't mean to claim that being discriminated on my hair is the same as racism or something
As a queer, disabled person I understood and get it, that's why I'm so into 'you have rights' (we usually know btw, just can't really proof it)
I can imagine you get it then
When do you encounter discrimination on those things
I always read stuff about racism, but I'm hardly aware of other kinds of discrimination
Mante Religieuse (religious mantis, probably because she looks like she's praying)
Haan is also a type of beetle
Almost
That would be Springhaan
I wouldn't mind that either
The lazyhorse isn't the same as your other examples though
Luipaard comes from the same root as leopard, and has nothing to do with an actual horse
On the other hand zeehond, nijlpaard and zeepaard come from zee-hond (sea-dog), nijl-paard (Nile-horse) and zee-paard (sea-horse)
How can you even put your country beside your name
You're welcome under our boot
Olé Olé Olé
Les Lacs du Connemara is also quite famous though
You have Stromae and Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike to refer to but this is what first comes to your mind
We for sure have a lot of international artists
If I have to choose one to compare to the national anthem, then Lange JoJo is the one that comes to mind ye
Saying we are a part of France and Netherlands put together, or French people and Dutch people put together
I won't speak for the Flemings, but for Walloons, saying we are French or a part of France is particularly insulting because :
* It is ***historically totally inaccurate***. We speak a Romance language because of the Roman Republic and Empire, not because of France
We have been part of France for only 20 years, under Napoléon
All the remaining time, we have been counties and duchies within the Holy Roman Empire, from it creation up to the end of 14th century, then under Burgundy, then Hapsburg empire/monarchs, Spanish then Austrian
Liège has been its own "independent" entity the whole time until 1795, always as part of the HRE alone
Wallonia and Brabant have more common history with Germany and the Netherlands than it ever had with France
* It is ***culturally incorrect*** : Walloons may speak French today, but it is fairly recent ; our historical and cultural language is Walloon
Most people born before WW2 still spoke Walloon at home, French being for public life
Walloons were forced to speak French by the bourgeois/rich and aristocratic elite from Brussels, Flanders and the rich parts of Wallonia
They tried to do the same in Flanders, but failed
Had they been as successful as they had been in Wallonia, Flemings would speak French today too, would they be seen as French people too then
So, speaking French doesn't make us French
We have a different culture from the Frenchies; a different history, a different way to do things
We might share a lot with them today, but it's mostly due to medias and collaborations in arts
That they don't like our fries
Hey as far as i'm concerned Portuguese is so much cooler to hear than spanish
One sounds like happy drunk people, the other like the military
i played the board game of "the slimste mens" and she thought that kopenhagen was in the netherlands
as a flaming/fleming/flamand whatever I also hate it and i hate everybody who wantes to split our country to join those respective countries
i'm not dutch and i rather be walloon french or german before i become dutch
One way to avoid that would be to become religiously Iranian back : get rid of the Arab religion that is Islam, which terrorize your country with its religious dictatorship, and revive Zoroastrianism as your main religion
Why worship a foreign god from a foreign religion that was forced down upon you by Arab invasions
> That we are East Europe
In many European countries, there is no concept of Central Europe, so you are either Western, Northern, Eastern or Southern (Edit : "you are" : for people of said countries that is
And there is no offense or insult meant by that)
so you have beef with 100+ countries recognizing it's independence good luck
Kosovo je Srbija !
And beers !
did the austrian empire even have grounds outside of europe
I would think that would be a catalyst for saying something like that
said with respect as belgium was once part of austrian empire
Well, we have the population of a big metropolis, and we 98% of our people live in cities
So, in a way, we could be seen as a very extended city
If it weren't said by Trump, it could have been a good joke about the country
our tradition our decision
it's a tradition in the netherlands and belgium
you have the origins of santa, saint nicolas and he brings gifts to all children that were good that year and  black petes are his army of black face side kicks "helpers"
but it's a seperate day 6 december unlike santaon christmass
the current explanation for the black face is that black pete comes in through the chimney but that does not look like it since we use full black paint , pete has curly black hair and red lips
"roet veeg piet" soot wipe pete serves to make a black pete more like the lore would suggest and makes a pete with black smeres on his face
Its probably cause it is pronounced the same way and then my brain doesn't kick in and stays on automatic
Sorry dude I don't hate you I just hate to be you
"poepen "! ="kakken"
"aardappel" =="patat"
my apologies the translation of the list wasn't as well updated as the english version
I don't think Americans who didn't vote for Trump should apologise
Those who voted for Trump, that's another story
How did your country punished/behaved towards collaborators who worked with Nazi Germany
Saw recently a Flemish tv program where they interviewed kids from collaborators during the Nazi regime in Belgium that explained how their life was after the war
And I was wondering how other countries handled collaborators
I will only talk about Wallonnia because Flanders didn't do nearly the same thing
Most were sent to prison and/or had death penalty
For the one who were not judged(in smaller village) there were a wave of murder which is commonly known as the "Secret des tombes" as most resistant knew who murdered them but they kept the secret till they all died
Leon Degrelle lived like a king in Spain
Uganda
Is this random or was there a specific relation between Malta and Uganda
Russian officials doing things mainly for political reasons
NO WAY
But what hair
I remember mitterand the genius, he collaborated with nazis and resistants just to win in every case
Yeah but in Wallonia it was mostly like in Luxembourg and in France where Colabo were murdered and their investigation were closed without any answer
In Flanders we had a lot of people fighting with the Nazi regime because they believed this would help Flanders getting independent
Most of them didn't even agree with the Nazis
So you could make the point: why execute if they even didn't agree with them
But I get where you're coming from
True, I understand your point
A ton
Basically every time I go on vacation I visit at least one castle, often more than one
I've visited castles in Belgium, Luxembourg, England, Scotland, France, Germany, Spain and maybe Austria, Croatia, Italy and the Netherlands too as a kid
I know I've been there but can't remember if I visited a castle or not
Each holiday like two or something
We mostly go to France so yeah
Hard to say
I would estimate that over the years I've been to about 10-20 castles depending on if you count fortresses as well
Visited as in stepped into and all that
5 or so I think
The one in Ghent city center with school, visited some in France on holiday, etc
Seen
Way to many
Private insurance additional to the state one
Car + fuel card
Phone subscription
Financial bonuses twice a year
Meal cheques
Pretty much any training we want
13th month of salary + holiday money
We don't have any buses around at midnight, but yeah, drunks randomly singing is to be expected c:
At least they had taste, singing Queen
(French language) thick Québécois and various African accents can be very difficult to understand yes, but when it comes to Africa, it really depend the country as well
My girlfriend, who is from Cameroon, actually adapts her accent when speaking to non-Cameroonese people
Afrikaans isn't really the same as Dutch, but still
and I find it pretty hard to understand
I can't have a conversation in Afrikaans
But in the same way, I can't have a conversation with somebody from here who's speaking a completely different dialect than mine, so it's not that weird
Congolese people speaking french isn't really a problem
It's rather easier than harder
I don't speak Spanish or Portugese so that doesn't matter
When it comes to French, Africans tend to speak more sophisticated actually, ([Eddy Malou] the best of course)
South-African is not easy to understand as a European Dutch-speaker
I've never spoken to someone from Suriname so I can't say anythikg about that
Just checked, and it appears "Cameroonian" is the correct form
Well, my bad
In French, my mother tongue, it is : "camerounais". The equivalent of the "-ais" ending in English is : "-ese", and I assumed that word frollowed the same logic in English, since we don't say "camerounien" in French ("-ien" ending in French is the equivalent of English "-ian")
But was wrong, ah
it's not the accent that's sophisticated, it's the level of language : vocabulary, grammar, etc
Do you differentiate between different phases
For example 1789 is the start, but the execution of the the King didn't happen until 1793
And Napoleon didn't really come to power untill 1799
While the rest of Europe colonised the world, Germany tried to conquor Europe
And the "world" made Germany feel very bad about it
Meanwhile Congo, Vietnam, Philippines, Algeria, Tunisia, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, North America, South Africa, other African countries, India and others go brrrrrrrr
Moules-frites
I hate the mussels part, not the fries part
Vol-au-vent, super overrated
Also, Gentse Waterzooi, how do people like that
The few things I don't like aren't that popular here (Fennel, coriander and Americans call Brussel's sprours), and I guess like all Belgian diishes
fries with mayonaise, ketchup is just that much better
Go back to the shadows you came from
In my (Belgian) opinion, Dutch food is extremely "basic", but it's almost always fine
British food on the other hand is usually not fine
I tend to leave British restaurants with regret
Also, stroopwafels and kruidnoten are fantastic
Same, and I personally dislike almost every European rice dish
Imo stoofvlees (carbonade flamand) is a better national dish
Mussels are eaten just as much in the Netherlands
I didn't even know it was considered our national dish untill a few years ago lol
I don't like spaghetti or any pasta either so you shouldn't care about my opinion about food lol
Risotto is indeed one of the exceptions yes
I sadly can't help you with that
I can't cook
Maybe you can ask on r/belgium
German people are also more direct at least compared to Belgians
TIL I'm German
Wait, is that weird
We do as well
How else do you make "the circle" when you arrive or leave
Roet Piet for life
Do we
I’m belgian too and I’ve never really done that
Google maps doesn't show me small pathways or walking routes that are shorter though
Like, I know shortcuts through Leuven that won't show on Maps
Change it to Roet Piet and I agree
There's no sensible reason to use black face
Ugh no thanks
And this is why Belgium is a seperate country
Brabant and Limburg need to be reunited again for this purpose
The Africa museum in Tervuren just outside of Brussels
The musical instrument museum just for the wonderfull building
The Mundaneum in Mons about a first attempt at a world wide knowledge database
Flanders Fields in Ypres the reference museum for world war 1
And the battle of the bulge museum in Bastogne
I'm a big fan of the Kröller Möller museum
And ofcourse u/arthistorybrussels !
Museum of Natural Sciences is also a great recommendation
If only for the dinosaur exhibit
Almost non existing as they only started over here last year
We have 6 KFC's, 7th one coming to Antwerp in December
To make a comparison, numbers from 2018, McDonalds has 80 restaurants under the management of 24 franchisees and nearly 4,500 employees
Also, we have an original European chain of hamburger restaurants called Quick
It originated in Belgium but I think it's French now
Until they were bought by Burger King that is
A lot of them were changed to Burger Kings in Belgium, but before that, I guess there were 450+ of them in France, Belgium and Luxembourg
We only got our first KFC a couple years ago iirc
I always went to eat in a KFC when I was in another country
According to their own website, first one in Belgium opened in 2019
Oh yeah sorry I didn't see your first sentence for some reason
Crazy that there are already 6 KFCs in less than 2 years
I think in most Western countries it's a fundamental skill
Otherwise you would have to buy prepared food every day which is a lot more expensive and unhealthy and requires you to give up other things
You can do without if you have to money for it is what I'm trying to say
If you don't know at least 5 different dishes by heart and aren't able cook using basic instructions in a cookbook, people assume you're hopeless
UK feels very close even tho it’s a (small) channel away
The UK
Probably the neighbour I like the most
the UK, because they helped getting us independent and there's just a little sea between us
We were one country once
But then Belgium’s teenage years came and then it all fell apart
Belgium was part of Austria for 94 years, before the conquests of Napoléon
The Belgian revolution wasn't just throwing a fit
For example, we basically had no representation in governance in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands
Every time our representatives didn't vote the way the North did, they'd just not count our votes
On top of that, even though Belgium had more people than the Netherlands, we didn't receive a proportional amount of representatives
In fact, we received less than the North
Then there was a whole other hoist of issues like the lack of freedom of the press or freedom of education
In fact, relations between Belgium and the Netherlands were so soar that shortly after we gained independence we planned on invading the Netherlands
History would've turned out way differently if France didn't stop that
It's only since after the world wars that relations between Belgium and the Netherlands turned for the better
For half our history we were sworn enemies
These days people have forgotten why there was a revolution in the first place
Really
Hey it is just a joke
I know that in the beginning it was bad between us but pls
France would not have helped us actually, they didn't want us to attack at all, which is why we didn't.
No one mentions Portugal :(
Invade Netherlands, make it forfeit its colonies to Belgium, potentially liberate territories hostile to the Dutch Royal family
Even though the Royal family was extremely popular amongst some of the population, a large minority in the Netherlands was  hostile for the same reason Belgium revolted
Additionally, Belgium had a large espionage mission in the Netherlands, exposing the Dutch military functioning and plans to the Belgian enemy
On top of that the Netherlands barely had an army to begin with compared to Belgium
Prussia would not join the war if France did not join the war
The UK couldn't join the war as it was preoccupied with other wars
Eventually the plan was cancelled because the French advised strongly against it
The exact plan has been destroyed, and so have the communications between France and Belgium about the potential invasion
The UK was caught up in its own wars, unable to do much
Prussia agreed to not intervene if France didn't. What exactly the communication was between France and Belgium is unknown as the records were destroyed, but we know that France was not supportive of a Belgian invasion of the Netherlands resulting in a Belgian colonial empire
We're also talking about a period where Belgium was one of the richest countries on the planet
Not per capita, but in absolute numbers
The Dutch navy was bigger I believe, but would've also been ineffective at defending the Netherlands
Belgium got its hands on all Dutch military plans and exactly how it planned to defend, so it knew to avoid fighting in certain locations
The idea was to get to the big cities like Amsterdam in one sweep and have the Dutch government resign the war
The Dutch military was mostly effective abroad
We don't in Belgium but I remember watching some of your national ads for it in my Spanish classes and it was great (mostly the one with the old janitor
Italy: going out in Bologna (left lively student city), the lakes and mountains in the North, fresh amazing pizzas for 2 euros, buying weird illegal maffia cigarettes in Napoli and realizing they're super unhealthy so trying to sell them again in shitty Italian, oh and a super cool free festival on the beach in Ravenna (Beaches Brew)
Slovenia: Calamares, lake Bohinj, taking cheap trains in the beaaautiful nature, meeting some awkward but super chill and nice guys who gave us a joint
Croatia: spending all day swimming in the sea, beautiful sunsets, naked midnight swims
Germany: Drinking tons of beer and smoking inside (!!!) of the bars, the cool artistic vibe in Berlin
Scotland: the constant feeling of being in the Harry Potter movies (Glenfinnan is where the viaduct is which they used for the train scenes
), the sincerety and accent of the people
Spain: Bars with huge plates of tapas, sleeping outside in the mountains near Madrid (they are beautiful and super reachable with a cheap bus), hearing everyone curse constantly I (have the feeling people there curse a lot), the Moroccan vibe in Granada
Portugal: Getting lost in all the small streets in Lisbon, sleeping in a big house (airbnb) in Sintra with a lot of friends and having the feeling that it was haunted (some low key creepy shit happened, was funny), being there when they won the Euro cup in 2016
Norway: Being in the north in the summer, so it never went dark (or like maybe for 1 hour), so I went out for a midnight walk and it was really cool, I felt like I was the only person in the world, it was super misty around the mountains
Bosnia: Eating suuuper cheap (like 2 euros for a full plate in a restaurant), being in shisha bars
Hungary: Walking on a hill with a cool view in Budapest and drinking beers there, listening to music, going out in a club with a cool courtyard and talking to a lot of people there, the cheap delicious gnocchi I ate (I still think about it a lot)
Montenegro: Visiting a free cat museum, I was in a bad mood that day but that made me smile at least
(Okay now that I sum this up I realize more how much I like cheap food haha)
I don't travel enough to have a favorite memory, they are all good :)
I have been to: France, Germany, Denmark, Luxembourg and Austria
I also passed trough the Netherlands with a night-buss (way back from Denmark) :S. You guys have good roads the moment we passed the Belgian border we all woke up to chant "We zijn er bijna" (We are almost there)
Not sure we we felt that we where almost home
Leffe is NOT a Trappist beer but commercial 'Abbey' beer by AB Inbev
Visiting the EU parlement as a highlight says something about Belgium i guess
The lights balance out our atrocious roads
That way you can see the pothole that will wreck your tire
We have the Aquino family from maasmechelen, large scale drug trafficking and a couple of violent hit's by what might be a local branch of the Italian maffia
The more I read about him, though, the more I get the feeling this Hitler fella may not be the standup guy he made himself out to be
I feel like Flanders and Wallonia will split up at some point
We, Brussels should be a tax-free enclave
Which would be funny because Flanders has the majority of the Belgian population
Historically, Antwerp province is just a part of Brabant
Some people tried to change its name to Midden Brabant once
I've never in my life seen a stray dog but I know there are some stray cats
Stray dogs are very rare here
Stray cats are a bit more common, but I wouldn't say we have a stray cat problem
I've seen a couple of dogs without owners around
But generally I assumed they do actually have an owner
Like maybe a dog from a farm nearby that walks freely around in the neighborhood around the fields of cows etc
I never saw a dog (in Belgium at least) that I honestly thought was homeless/ownerless
Stray cats do exist
We put the fat parts of ham or stuff like that outside on a little plate for the stray cats in the neighborhood
But I don't think they're that many that they're a problem
Farm dogs just walk around freely yeah
But they're pretty well behaved whenever I see one
Yes, Dutchmen love dogs
One of the reasons why I love the Netherlands so much
Here we often have the friends and family party seperated
I can remember when the family was here, I opened presents when everybody was there (so everybody could see what the otherd had given)
But with my friends, my mom always forbid me to open them one there were still kidd because if people gave biggere or smaller things, nobody would know it (and I to would have already forgotten who gave it)
Distances in Europe are in general way shorter than the US
A two hour drive is considered VERY FAR as in my case, that gets you across the country
I guess depending on where you live there isn't much to do on a bike over there
Belgium is as you can probably expect a collection of small towns mostly(because history) so the kids use a bike to simply travel everywhere in the town
I had a sports center, hobbies(football field), swimming, shopping, school, etc
etc
all within 2 miles of me so by the time I was 12 I was free to go wherever  I wanted because my parents knew there was nothing I could want outside of town basically that wasn't right nearby and I wasn't going to drive my bike 20 miles to the nearest big city
Put a line of 1k kilometers on Brussels and see how many capital cities you can reach
I've been watching a lot of things in regards to countries on youtube(from the US, Germany, Japan, Korea, etc
etc
) and one is an American family with children coming to Denmark and how they would for example never let a 16 year old take the train alone back at home
American kids have it ROUGH imo
Basically no freedom at all
So no, most of them couldn't take the bike at 12 with some friends to go play a bit of sports half a mile away
*Boke mé choco*
So a slice of bread with chocolate spread ("Nutella")
It just tastes of childhood nostalgia
Turkish Dürüm
Mitraillette
sandwich " (Filet) Américain préparé" with raw vegetables
Very popular here
12 euros last i used it for a return to basically anywhere in the country
A standard ticket can be as cheap as €2,50 or as expensive as €21,50 depending on how far you're traveling
You can also buy a 10-ride-card here which will net you
€85
About
€8,30 per ride
Granted, you can go from one end of the country to the other for that price
Otherwise there's a variety of subscriptions you can sign up for if you know you'll be taking the train daily, and cheaper tickets if you're planning on staying exclusively in certain regions like Antwerp or Brussels
So the average price for a ticket is gonna fall around like
If you ask a Belgian, too bloody expensive
If you ask just about anyone else: very cheap
The train company is a gov company
So the prices are subsidized
A ticket from Antwerp (north) to Brussels (centre) is €7
A ticket to one of the longest distances: Antwerp (most north) and Arlon (most south) is about €21
However if you are <26yo, you qualify for severely reduced rates with the Go-Pass (€6
6 on any destination, even less if you buy a ticket of 10, which comes down on €55 euro for ten destinations anywhere in Belgium)
If you're a daily commuter you can also qualify for a single destination subscription which is 1) cheaper; 2) often covered by your employer
If you're under 26, a train ticket to anywhere else in the country will be €6,60 both ways
If you're over 26, you don't get very far for that price
There's tons of special ticket rates and subscriptions which are not too expensive if you take the train each day, but it is definitely pretty expensive if you only use the train occasionally
Not to mention that the amount of trains, their reliability and punctuality is god awful
I guess that's the price of only having one railway company
6,60€ for -26yo, no matter the distance
A lot more expensive for adults
10km is something like 3,50€.
I really can't wait to visit Italy and travel around by train
My parents did that a few times and they are always gushing about the trains there and how cheap they are
Wow, I've never thought about it from the perspective of someone living just across the border
You can get some crazy bargains if you live in or near the extremities of our country, though you would need to be patient enough to sit on a train for really long as well
I have been commuting daily to school for almost 10 years, then back and forth to university on a weekly basis
As much pet peeves as I have about the SNCB/NMBS (and believe me, I do have an awful lot), I think they do a pretty good job of running the trains and they've definitely improved over the years
^(Though they could improve even more if they addressed my pet peeves
Imo the NMBS/SNCB gets way more hate than they deserve
I rarely have problems with them
I've only been taking a train once week for the past 6 months (and always the same route), but I've never been late (except once because of technical issues with a train) so I'm fairly happy with them
Here in Belgium we see they railway service as bad but if you actually compare it it's pretty good
Only annoying thing is that it works with nodes around a few big cities which can make some trips unnecessarily long
I have never understood the hate for them either
Coming from Germany, using the train here is absolutely amazing
Very cheap (with the Rail or Go Pass) and pretty reliable
I've commuted by train for 2 years quite smoothly
People who say the trains are late all the time must have been spoiled somewhere and have never been to Germany
A lot of lines go to Brussels first before branching off
Before the long series of regionalisation reforms that started in the 1970's, Belgium was a very centralised nation, with Brussels at its centre
You can still see that today when looking at the lay-out of the railway and motorway infrastructure, or how the postal codes radiate outwards from Brussels like spiral
Even today, institutions like the Flemish government or the Francophone government (Wallo-Brux), have their seat in Brussels, even though the majority of the people they represent don't live there
While not a public institution, I think it's noteworthy that Italy's stock market is in Milan, and not Rome, which underlines the importance of Northern Italy's economy, compared to Central and Southern Italy
And Brussels isn't even part of Flanders but the Flemish government is still there
Don't Turkish cities have flags
> especially since Paris has fewer inhabitants than Berlin
Paris' population is a lot bigger than just the city of Paris itself
If you consider the whole agglomeration, you get around 10-12 million inhabitants (depending on the definition)
Berlin on the other hand only has about 4-6 million inhabitants
The Flemish government also represents the Flemish Community, which does cover Brussels though
A typical example of Belgian ingenuity
Yeah I know, I was talking about the Flemish Region
Don't know how it is in other places but here every province and almost every city/town has their own flag: [some are pretty cool, some are pretty boring, you can see them here if you want]
The flag of Friesland is amazing
And Utrecht too imo
We actually didn't have any mandatory books, but we had to read a couple of books each year by Belgian or Dutch authors (in essence, originally written in Dutch)
I did not actively dislike any of the ones I read but there aren't any contemporary or historical really famous works in Dutch and that's because most of them are just very basic
Not particularly bad, but not particularly good either
"Le Hussard sur le toit" ("The Horseman on the Roof") by Jean Giono
I should have just watched the movie, it was sufficient to respond to the exam
Too much description of the country side in the novel, it was excrutiating
I remember staying all night long up drinking coffee
It was worthless in the end since the questions were super easy
I'm Flemish, so not really a national classic, but every pupil in my school is required to read "Les Misérables" by Victor Hugo
Our French wasn't even that good, as they made us read it at the age of 14
Litterally most boring book ever, especially if you can't understand half of it
If I can burn all the copies of that book, I would definitely do it
I also had to read Le Père Goriot for school and I could not finish it, it was simply too boring
The only other book that I could not finish was Madame Bovary
It felt like the main subjects of the book  were disappointments and boredom
Floris ende Blancefloer
Had to read the original medieval text and it was a horrible experience
Dat stond er dus niet
Het was ook niet zo dat we enige inleiding hadden gekregen op de Middelnederlandse/Oud-Nederlandse (weet al niet meer welke) taal
Het was gewoon voor de les Nederlands, zonder enige context
Bruh imagine being so dumb
The real issue is that the USA has an absolutist view on free speech that allows easy radicalisation of people
These people are praised and hailed within their community
They do it to turn into a martyr
This needs to be cracked down on
You should not glorify mass shooters as this inspires others
Banning guns is a quick way to slow down the radicals while they are cracked down upon
I do think you can get away with loose gun laws if you keep the community on the right track
Honestly I don't really give a fuck
The Americans can do what they want in their own country
They can jerk off to their gun for all I care it's none of my business
I don't understand their obsession over guns, but whatever floats their boats I guess
Was coming here to write this
Comparing Switzerland with the USA is like comparing apples with pears
Until an American mentioned it this morning I didn’t even know that Swiss citizens can have guns, and that says a lot
I did some research on Swiss gun laws and read that gun owners are screened and trained before they can have a gun (correct me if I’m wrong, though), but in the USA you can literally just buy them at Walmart
Don’t compare a country with good gun laws to a country with horrible gun laws
Cheers, fixed it
I absolutely have enough disposable income, and I don't make sacrifices to have it
Overall my life quality is pretty sweet
The thing that I feel we are behind compared to others like the USA is the ability to make a lot of money
It's difficult to go above a certain threshold due to very high taxes (I'm not saying that is a bad system, it's certainly very egalitarian)
For example, I'll never have a "buy a sports car or a new BMW with this year's bonuses" money, it would take years (plural) of savings instead
In other places this seems banal
In my home country in the South, I absolutely did not have disposable money as I have now
Personally my goal was to buy a 200k apartment and with my median income(about €2100 after tax(we also have more than 12 months of income and all that)) have a 25k buffer and just begin investing everything above that
While paying the mortgage I could easily save about €800/month + another 3k or so every year in "bonus" so that's about 12600 every year in savings
My goal isn't to have a lot of money, I'm cheap as chips, it's to no longer need to work
Parents are wealthy
I did the boats, sports cars, 10k+ trips worldwide and honestly
not that amazing
Not necessary
Not worth the stress to try and earn a lot of money imo
Small apartment, second hand car, relaxing job > big house, sports car and stressful job
Also remember that the entire "retire early" basically requires a passive income you're happy with until your pension kicks in when you get a nice bonus on your passive income as well
If I say, get €1500/month passive that would be enough for me to retire at say, 45
But when I get to say, 60, I can expect some pension(not a lot because in this case I didn't work a lot of course) to top it up more
Not really true, in Belgium there is a growing (and very real) concern that retirement funds for current generations are fucked, if you want to live comfortably in the future it's wise to invest
I had a 600EUR bonus on my December's paycheck
Netto
250EUR
You'll never become rich by working (for someone else) in Europe
You'll need to have own a successful business, flip-houses, be a slumlord or work in an investment bank or top consulting company
That said, quality of life is pretty good and you'll never be found lacking for anything
Overall I'm happy with this arrangement
I remember being surprised by how much Americans made until I knew this
50k? That's insane
I thought
I make about that but see about 28k.(no dependents, not married, etc
so tax wise I get screwed :p)
Wouldn't it be then be way more useful to state post tax income since that's what you actually get
Yeah that's true, fair enough
As a French-speaker I happen to forget a lot about words in my everyday life due to the fact that all the medias that I watch these days, all the people that I communicate with, from youtube to reddit to twitter, are in English
So when I talk to my friends or anyone else, I often sneak english words in my french sentences because it's the words that pop up in my mind
I forgot how to say "ladder" in French
I had to make my mom guess by saying "oh yeah, you know, the long bars with other bars in the other direction".
This isn´t really uncommon in Europe, Belgium has 3 official languages and pretty much every Fleming also speaks English
Granted the third one is not a required subject in most studies (German)
Personally, i LOVE Finnish
Its super hard to learn, but when i listen to Finns speak, or Finnish music, it almost sounds like a spell/echantment being cast, something magical to it
Danish, it has the word edderkopp for spider
In the French-speaking Community, it's La Une from the French-speaking public service broadcaster (RTBF)
In the German-speaking Community, it's BRF
It's the German-speaking equivalent to RTBF
AFAIK it's the only German-speaking Belgian TV channel
In Flanders, it's één from the Flemish public service broadcaster (VRT)
~~RTBF, BRF and VRT used to be one TV channel
They were - as far s I know - not one TV channel as the language split already happened when there was only radio available
Wikipedia says this split happened in 1937 already
If you have Telenet, then Eén is on channel 2 and VTM is on channel 1
In Flanders, Eén is the most popular TV channel
Is La Une the most popular in Wallonia
Or is it RTL  TVI
The Belgian version of RTL is quite crappy though : commercial/private channel, that favours sensationalism over objectivity, and seems directed at a non-intellectual/non-educated public (and of course, has a very center-right wing bias, since it is a corporate TV channel)
Oh ok, corrected
I always thought they split up when Communities where created
It was RTL TVI for a long time but nowadays it's La Une
I knew it was way sooner, but not that soon to be honest :) I thought it happened somewhere in the 60s maybe but as it seems, they were practically always seperated
Same in French : *tu* one person you are familiar with, *vous*, which is the second person plural, is as well used for formally adress one single person
Belgians fixed that for you
I much prefer being in a country with Wallonia than with the Dutch
We have cultural and political autonomy in the present Belgium while the Dutch would no doubt assimilate us due to the size difference
We are already connected enough to them as is
Doubt I'd be the only one with that viewpoint if it actually came to happen
Lot of people could be found for an independent (within the EU) Flanders but I think comparatively few would want to be Dutch
can't we just unite with Luxembourg ? Everybody loves Luxembourg right ?
we have a prince with nothing to do, they can have him
not just the US
Fuck \*runs to closest castle\* do we have to kick someone out again
i'll call england and france
let's just keep belgian royalty away from anything delicate
I like my african countries alive
I dunno
I dont reply to such threads if they don't apply to me
Relax dude
Or leave
Basically your options if you say you hate this place
Not a hospital worker, but
Non, moi, je suis belge, pas française
I used to believe that all countries had a national monument, like the Atomium, Eiffel Tower, Berlin TV Tower, Big Ben, the Colosseum, Akropolis, Pyramids of Giza, and the Great Wall for instance
We all have a name, flag, anthem, capital, head of state, abbreviation, national animal, and more after all
I was always found it odd the Netherlands didn't seem to have one
We once asked a Dutch woman somewhere in Switzerland and she said probably Windmills
Only later did I realize that these national monuments aren't as universal as these other country clues
**Just for fun:** If I didn't name your country's "national monument", what would it be
Honestly I thought the same
I think in Poland the national monument could be the castle of krakow
Idk if that castle has an official name tho lol
Funny anecdote from a Belgian
I was speaking Belgian Dutch in my local dialect to my family on vacation in Austria and some shopkeeper I believe asked if we were Swiss
Mistaking the 2 dialects
I can see why though as both probably have some French influence
I'd not be surprised if many Belgians would want to form a single country out of the Benelux tho
The Dutch, English, French and Germans all tell these jokes
You should have, and it would be glorious
You have the Deltaworks
Those are honestly more impressive than any of the others
I would say it's Kinderdijk, or maybe even the Afsluitdijk but yeah, it isn't really as conclusive as in other countries
Where I live, that's just a bit of trivia
Yes you're right, and most of us know that but at the end of the day it's still just Big Ben for us
Google Images speaks for itself
Yeah, I guess the Brandenburg Gate might have been the better pick
It just never really impressed me as we have the [same thing] in Belgium yet nobody **ever** talks about it
You can even go up close to the horses when visiting the nearby military museum
I had only ever seen the Atomium and Eiffel Tower at that point so I guess they influenced my thinking
I honestly wouldn't mind much
Imagine the economic power
I agree with you except for maybe "special rock formations" (i.e. mountains), like for example the Matterhorn in Switzerland, Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Everest in Nepal and Uluru-Kata Tjuta in Australia
We do but that's just because we're quite a big family (not a large amount of children, everyone just lives to be very old) and no conventional table would be able to have all of us at it
So there's a "kid's table" (I use parentheses because half of the kid's table are legal adults), but it's fine
I've more in common with my brother, nieces and nephews than my parents, uncles, aunts and grandparents
Belgian here visiting the French city of Vichy today
Didn't expect to be that hot (max was 38C°)
Why would it be rude
No, that's why sandwiches and durums are so popular
My noon meal is often a sandwich I eat on the walk from the restaurant back to the workplace
Time is money
"Belgium is a loathsome chocolate goulag" -John Oliver
‘I pause to ask myself what it’s like to be a Belgian, if there is such a thing
Too proud
Too masochistic
Difficult to decide
Like the mule, it seems to be a country without pride in paternity or hope of posterity
’ Christopher Hitchens in Slate
Belgium was created to annoy the Belgians themselves
That, is facts my friends
According to Wikipedia there are 30 positions in our Court of Cassation
I would say that the relevant courts for this comparison are either the Constitutional court or the State Council
The State Council is the highest administrative court in the country
It is composed of 44 judges who are distributed among 15 sections (7 Flemish, 7 Francophone, 1 bilingual) that oversee different kinds of cases
This is also the State Council that reviews the laws before they are voted by the parliament
The Constitutional court is there to make sure that no legal act in Belgium contradicts the constitution
It is composed of 12 judges
- 3 Flemish professional judges
- 3 Flemish former politicians
- 3 Francophone professional judges
- 3 Francophone former politicians
They must be at least 40 and are nominated for "life", but they actually have to retire at 70
There is a political equilibrium in place, so that the court reflects the political trends of the parliament
For instance, if in the parliament, the social democrats are the first group, followed by liberals, greens and christian democrats, then the 6 judges (of that linguistic group) will probably be something like 2 social democrats, 2 liberals, 1 green and 1 christian democrat
If the green judge retires and there is a vacancy, it will be up to the green party to nominate someone
Then, the senate has to approve the nomination by a 2/3rd vote
Oh okay I just looked up 'supreme court of belgium' and the 'court of cassation' popped up
And Wikipedia said that that's basically the Supreme Court
You're right that the court of cassation is also very important, and is the highest court for what it's doing
Basically, in the US they have only one court (supreme court) that oversees everything, while in Belgium we have several specialized courts for different jobs
Cassation's role is to make sure that all the rulings by other courts are made in accordance to the law
It will not rule on the content of the case, but on how it was conducted in lower courts
If there were irregularities in the procedures, then the cassation court will break these rulings and a new trial must be held
But it won't say anything on the content, it will not rule that X is guilty or innocent
Thanks I had no idea how that all worked
> So when a German wants to say 76, he says “Sechsundsiebzig” or “six and seventy” as opposed to “seventy six” in English
Same in dutch
Pretty much
Dutch for 26 -> Zes(6) en twintig(20)
German -> Sechs(6) und zwanzig(20)
It's pronounced like way but with a t in front of it
It turns out the army barracks ("Francisca Barracks St
Tonis") where I during my military service is "disused".
Apparently, there is "stuff" in the soil that needs to be handled before the site can be used for another purpose
Not per se barracks but around Antwerp the were 2 fort-belts from Napoleonic ages untill ww1
One of the forts, at the suburb Wilrijk, is property of the university of Antwerp because the university has an "outside campus" that is right next to it
There are now (before Corona) a lot of party's for students
And it is PERFECT, no old people that just hate our fun, no young families with babys that have to much noice
Just drunken students in an old fort
There were barracks in my village but they have been turned into shops
The municipality bought the barracks from the state because the state wanted to turn them into a centre for asylum seekers
I work in a refugee center in Belgium in what used to be an old army base
The refugee center has been in operation for over 20 years now, but it still has a very 'military feel' to it: an abandoned guard house at the entrance, the 'decoration' that's clearly from it's previous use,...
Where in Belgium
Sint Truiden
It's a trend we see on a countrywide scale as well
r/Belgium uses English as the lingua franca (though posts in all 3 official languages are allowed) and is filled with Flemish and has little to no Walloons
Walloons are present but I think they are not very active on r/Belgium because that sub is more Flemish oriented
r/Wallonia has been growing exponentially recently
It's just passed the 10k milestone
Stromae, Lost Frequencies and maybe also Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike
(and K3 in the Netherlands
EDIT: Loïc Nottet deserves way more recognition imo
The guy is a legend when it comes to music
Obvious ones are Jacques Brel, Stromae, Arno/TC Matic and a couple of DJ's/EDM artists
* Vaya Con Dios comes to mind as well
* Toots Thielemans
* Adamo
* Luc van Acker
* Technotronic (Pump up the jam)
* Praga Kahn/Lords of Acid
* Soeur Sourire (the singing nun)
* Helmut Lotti
* Axelle Red
* Front 242
* Lasgo
* Hooverphonic
**In other genres and more my cup of tea**: Amenra, Wiegedood, Oathbreaker, Channel Zero, Aborted
Some 90's fame goes out to the H8000 scene with f.e. Liar and Congress
Technotronic - Pump Up The Jam
I didn't know since a couple of months ago as a Belgian myself
Bonnie Tyler
Alan walker ?
2 Unlimited, Deus, Vaya Con Dios, Hooverphonic, Kate Ryan
Charlotte dewitte, amelie lens, marco bailey, joyhauser ...
The Scabs,
The Radio's,
Soulsister,
Milow,
K's Choice,
Novastar
Can't forget Hooverphonic
Rocco Granata can be considered as Belgian
Django reinhardt
Soulsister
Amenra
TIL Hozier is Irish
Master's Hammer
K's Choice also had quite some international succes with Not An Addict
You have so many artists who are way more popular than the guy who won Eurovision, though
I don’t even think he’s on the radio outside of the Netherlands
Rosalia
Not every shitty europop is Dutch
They still play Everytime We Touch at parties from time to time
Arch Enemy, Amon Amarth, Soilwork, Hypocrisy
In all honestly, I’ve never heard of those
Channel Zero, Aborted, Amenra, Ancient Rites, Ithilien, Steak Number Eight, Brutus, Enthroned, Diablo Blvd
and Fleddy Melculy
Not sure how popular they are in other countries, but I like Ancient Rites as well
I salute you, internet stranger with good taste
A lot of Europeans know him, though
I know people (non-Belgians) from all over Europe and they all knew him
Forgot that one
I know 1 song of Margaret but I also don’t know the rest
He is in Flanders
And most people know the song, according to my empirical research based on having heard 'ooooOoooOoOoOh' from more people than necessary
They're all techno dj's all of them touring around the world
Lots of Belgian dj's are popular around the world, but only with fans of their genre not in the mainstream
It's all Belgian metal of various kinds
Do you know many of the things other people say
The majority is modern pop and metal
Definitely glad I was aware of this before I went on exchange to France, I like to think it made most of my interaction quite pleasant
That's  what I am used to do as well in Belgium
Say hello to the entire waiting room or when someone else enters
Not everybody does it though
In the current times of Covid however, when I enter the doctor's waiting room, I just let out a deep cough
It mosly gets returned by some coughs from others
I feel like Patser is one of the best flemish movies made recently
Nawww you spoiled the ending
I LOVE Song of the Sea
Book of Kells too
Great animation and story
Not animated though
Cheese
That is all
Poepen is to shit in the Netherlands but to fuck in Belgium
The tight situation mainly arises when the Dutchman uses it in Belgium
Belgian French and French French aren't different enough to have tigh situations in case of weird use of expressions I would say
But there could be one ones
A towel (such as for shower or bath) in Belgium is called "un essui", while the French say "une serviette". Serviette in Belgium means : a napkin, generally paper one
So, ja, having a French person asking for a "serviette" while what he really wants is an "essui" is a bit odd
It's generally small details like that, variations in the vocabulary that could breed strange situations if the other person isn't aware of said differences
Some pronunciation is different too : â is Belgium is a long a, while most French people pronounce it like a normal/short a, so, they pronounce pâte (pasta) and patte (animal leg) the same way, so, orally, for a Belgian when they say "on va manger des pâtes" (we'll eat pastas), we actually hear "on va manger des pattes" (we'll eat animal legs)
Same goes for ê : long è in Belgium, short/normal è in France
'Vol zitten' is also used as being full from food in Flemish and I've never heard someone say 'sleuren' when they mean kissing
But all the other ones are true and the first one is really funny
Where were you in Belgium
Because in my part of Belgium, excité means as well : sexually aroused
Excitant however has a broader meaning not limited to sexual arousing
isn't it neuken
Yep true I remember watching Disney Channel and Nickelodeon as a kid and when somebody said 'Ik ben aan het poepen' my parents always looked at the tv to see what I was watching
can confirm: sleuren/bekken/muilen/een tong draaien are all used here (region East Flemish-Brabant)
also poeppoepen I've never heard, we just say anaal, or in a more vulgar way: "in de kakker nemen"
'Geil' is Dutch for horny
I really don't care if they are popular or not
I have a beard, and have one ever since I got laid off
There used to be an official office policy of "no facial hair allowed", meaning I had a moustache and never really got promoted
I now find shaving a waste of time and prefer to trim every week or so with an occasional visit to a real professional barber (now long overdue because of Covid)
Beards used to be something for old men, and monks
The occasional hippie too lazy to shave
But I must add, the number of men having a beard seems to have grown
Nowadays, a well-trimmed beard is a common sight
Those who can't grow a full beard without looking like a homeless crying in silence
Among 20-30-40's, it is more common to encounter
Not this popular
Women don't like them that much
Men are into it, but can't grow it, and even if they can, they're not worth the title of *beard* but rather  pubes
Women huh
Something you have common with Turkish people then lol
Where I'm from there have always been people with beards but it's like 15% of the people, whenever I have a beard it tends to be because I just didn't see the point in shaving it
>but can't grow it,
Really
I'm 18 and me and multiple of my friends have to shave our beard at least once a week and I think it's only going to grow quicker once we get older
Maybe we're exceptions though
Al die willen ter Kapren varen, moeten mannen met baarden zijn
Jan, Piet, Joris en Korneel, die hebben baarden, hebben baarden
Love how that song has different language versions
I am also 23 and I can also only grow a mustache + ugly version of a Lincoln beard
Very little hairs on my cheeks and my mustache doesn't connect at all with the rest
So clean-shaven it is
Luckily the average man's beard growth keeps improving well into his 40s, so maybe one day
I would like to have a Santa beard when I am retired
Or in case I don't end up with white hair, a thick mustache
You know, the "old man" look
I didn't mean to generalize every men in this country, but I think you know very well that >80% can't grow a *decent* beard
Honestly, I didn't know that haha
Hahaha fr fr
Well, i live in Oost-Vlaanderen and I'm a lot in Antwerp en this is what I see everyday tbh
I think the days of our Golden Generation are over sadly, especially seen the last few matches
We have some new youth coming in, but the coach continues to stick to the older experienced players, which I can understand in a way because they're battle-proven
But the defense with Vertonghen especially has become slow af
I reckon we could get semi's though still with this group
Boycotting the WC in Qatar as well
the worst thing for the belgian team is the current situation of Hazard
We need that creativity in our team
With his dribbling he can always force an opening in every defence
I believe in the boys, they will put up a fight and it's not like the other teams have their best form
It's now or never
We mustn't forget that we are in March, in the home stretch of the season  and that all the big teams also make shitty matches
KDB (who did not do his defensive job in the last match) for example thinks more about the CL with City than the selection
But yes the defense is worrying and if Eden Hazard and Witsel withdraw for the Euro, we must hope for a miracle and a great Lukaku / De Bruyne
Martinez also needs to learn to change tactics during the match
We don't know much about him and Martinez arouses the interest of the big European clubs
yeah,it would surprise me that he will come to Celtic
Given they just barely scraped past San Marino I sincerely doubt
True heroes <3
French, I'm probably one of the few people who has fond memories of French language camps
German, because it's almost Dutch, so everything sounds weird and cool to me
Portuguese because what's not to like about that language
An Russian just sounds amazing
Finnish and Hungarian
Both just sound so enchanting, like someone is casting a spell on me
Beautiful languages
Scottish English makes my panties drop
If you say something in German, it automatically sounds a lot sexier
I mean not that anyone really speaks it but Latin has a lot of cool words
Like ‘sanguis’ (blood) ‘Aquila’ (eagle) ‘silentium’ ( silence) ,...
Isn't it that you just like Sloan
I mean, who doesn't?

Not my country, but I know ser Francis Drake is a popular figure in Great Britain but a villain in Spain
Leopold II, though somewhat controversial in Belgium, he built most of the grand boulevards and huge buildings
Wouldn‘t say Belgians are really against him unless they‘re quite left
Doesn‘t have a great name internationally
Considering Dutch survived in Flanders while being suppressed for 100 years, I'm not worried at all
We're very proud of our language
I believe you underestimate how much governments have a hand in languages
Some regions are rather protective of their language
It's not just a case of what people speak
As long as the current French government exists for example French will continue to exist
There are so many dead languages, not really my main concern
I'd prefer a communicative language that functions globally
I work in Belgian government: everyone either natively speaks Dutch or French
The young Flemish/Walloon people find it easier to speak English with each other, whereas the older folks would usually switch to French
It is
A single team meeting will have the spoken language constantly switch between Dutch, French, and English
Sometimes you even switch mid-sentence if you don't remember a specific word in the language you're speaking at the time
And if a team member's native language were German, they would be fully in their right to speak German as well
I do wonder whether that has something to do with the incapable reputation of the Belgian government sector
Yea, I wish (dutch person from Belgium)
Post war butter smugglers
I've heard some wild stories about them from my grandparents, we live on the border
Ambiorix and his Eburonen come to mind, but that's about it for Belgium
We all know about knights anyway
Yeah that kind of sounds like what I heard, converted old army trucks and shootouts at chasing customs guards etc
Today - since I wouldn’t have had too much right during any period in the past
There's a flemish skit where someone from west-flanders (region famous in belgium for it's incomprehensible accent, similar to bavaria to germany, friesland to the netherlands and the USA to the UK) complains about being undertitled and/or dubbed
When the news undertitles it, a follow up skit shows him complaining with text written in the local dialect on cartboard (which is also undertitled)
In Dutch they don’t dub, they use subtitles over the English version
Never put mutch thought into this as i read them for the first time very young, but you're absolutely right
8 in Belgium
I'm not black myself, but I have witnessed racism towards black people
I once saw the police called on a black sales person, simply because some idiot thought it suspicious that a sales person were black
The police didn't even do their job right and actually sided with the racist
The poor girl was too nice and didn't want to create a ruckus
She left her job after this
They thought it better for keeping the peace if she quit
Rubbish excuses of course
I wouldn't call the Netherlands Northern Europe
Would you say it's more Greece with Balkan influences or Balkan with Greece influences
If it was splitting up Europe between North and South I would put the Netherlands North but I would seriously wish to cut Belgium along the language borders for that one
Walloon in Northern Europe is weird, Flanders in South Europe is also weird
It's more or less a Germanic/Latin border
Same reason you can make a (rather bad) argument for Belgium being Mediterranean
It seriously influenced us as well though nobody would call us that
With good reason imo
Mmm, you're not necessarily wrong and I can see why you say that
I think it's because the difference you see between Northern France and Southern France is the difference I see between Flanders and Walloon
It's rather identical
Industrial North
Less wealthy, more nature South
Putting the line at along the vineyards of France has it's appeal though
Ow, for sure
As I said, it would be an awful argument for us
It's just that it exists as an argument
Latvian and Lithuanian are more closely related than Dutch and French

Mia by Gorki is probably a good contender for the flemish part
Edit: actually, I'm not sure, it fits with the definition you gave but it's maybe not as emblematic
I don't really know for today but Jacques Brel songs sure were emblematic and knew all across the country
I reckon that kids wouldn't recognize it unless their parents listen to Brel
(Belgium)
Definitely [Mia by Gorki] At least for Flanders
Just such amazing song
RIP to Luc de Vos, what a legend
If you want to know the text, [Milow] did an English cover that's actually not even that bad
But obviously nothing can tip the original
Pretty much none for Belgium
You'd be hard pressed to find someone here that actually knows the anthem in the first place
That's probably just because the singer died a couple years ago
Made me think, was Brel iconic as well in the flanders ?
It was pretty iconic before as well though
I think [Laat ons een bloem] by Louis Neefs is a good contender though, and for Wallonia [anything by Jacques Brel] will do
This may sound a bit snobby, but he definitely is as iconic with the people who know French
Didn't even realise that song was Belgian
That's the problem though, because we are divided into Dutch and French speaking parts (German part as well), there aren't many 'Belgian' songs
You have flemish classics and Walloon classics like the one you said
Because it was in French I always thought it was from France + I don't know much about music
I know it's iconic but I wouldn't consider it a second anthem but I could be the only one here
Plenty of bands and artists recorded in multiple languages and had succes in both parts of the country though
For example Jacques Brel, 2 Belgen and Wannes Van De Velde all recorded in different languages
Recently Angèle and Stromae also had large succes in all of Belgium
Good point, but
While these are all Belgians indeed, do their songs make you feel 'emblematic' of Belgium
I don't think so, hence my answer that no song does
[Rabbit with prunes] is a classic dish here
It's considered to be for more special occasions, not your weekly routine dish
It used to be, but it’s getting less and less popular
Google "Flemish Giant rabbit"
Fuck yea we're eating those
Have to know where to get it and such though
Anything except for cow, pig and chicken will be a matter of knowing what shops sell it and such
Duck seems more related to Eastern regions but I've eaten those in Vietnamese dishes and such
Yes it is very normal in Belgium
dogs, cats and insects
I guess ?
You people even eat snails

Is it another one of these live action Disney reboots
If yes, then I'm definitely not hyped
Those movies don't bring anything new to the story and are just a shameless cash grab on their past success
But you say that it's an Italian movie, so not Disney
If yes, then why not, it could maybe bring something new to the table
He is talking from a base biological/sociological point of view, in which case he is right
It has always been a competition, not sure why you're trying to make this into a higher level point of view
Societal progressiveness has always in part been about trying to overcome primal instincts, but that does not make them disappear
Some of it does, others don't. The letters in the periodic table reflects their latin names
Since dutch is not a romance language, it often doesn't "make sense", but sometimes it does anyway
Most match in Dutch, like Na (natrium), K (kalium) and W (wolfraam), but not all:
H = waterstof
C = koolstof
N = stikstof
O = zuurstof
P = fosfor (no ph in Dutch)
S = zwavel
Fe = ijzer
Cu = koper
Rh = rodium (no rh in Dutch)
Sn = antimoon
Sb = tin
I = jodium
Au = goud
Hg = kwik
Pb = lood
Potassium comes from the Dutch word potas (pot + as) because Flemish (and maybe also Dutch) farmers knew they could fertilize their crops with potas
Yeah it's the same as dutch, only we write stof not stoff
there are a lot of regional dialects, and they're usually spoken within families or towns, but outside that everyone speaks the same flemish
older people use it more commonly in my experience, the youth speaks slightly more of a standard flemish, dutch, english blend
Very interesting overview
Same applies here in Belgium basically
Speaking the "normal language" just sounds weird
West Jutlandic is really cool: it lacks grammatical gender
The article en is used for countable nouns (apple, house, car) and et is used for uncountable nouns (snow, water)
Does anyone still speak like this
Or has everyone switched to Standard Danish
In my hometown Antwerp you have almost anything tbh, including good mexican tacos which seems to be a missing element here
I imagine the same is true for Brussels
Ghent I imagine will lean heavily towards the Turkish side, due to a large turkish population
Then all the smaller towns it's mostly friteries, kebab and (american style) pizzas
Kebab restaurants and Italian ( often combined:’ pizza and kebab ‘) also chinese takeaway restaurants and sushi bars
Of course there are also the big burger an pizza chains: McDonald’s, Quick/Burger King, Dominos, Pizza Hut
Kebab isn't Arab, it's Turkish
Kroket uit de muur
I know 1 good american style pizza chain here, all the rest are meh
I especially dislike pizza hut
I don't know if it's the same in all countries but pizza hut tastes like flavored cardboard / plastic here
I know 1 good mexican place, it's small and lets you fill a tortilla or taco with over 20 toppings to pick from
I can't compare with the US since I've never been but it's pretty good, especially compared to bigger chain mexican places
I think we're in a group where we might expect some more controversy before the tournament starts
We have to play in Russia and against Russia, but there's so much controversy about their sport associations that it wouldn't surprise me if they will be banned from competition (just like another ban by IOC and IAAF)
If Belgium and France face each other again during this tournament, that will be a heated match
Easy group and I think we'll even make it to the finals with a team like ours
I couldn't care less
Counties will soon drop their songs tho
Brazil didn't even manage to qualify for the Euros in 2004 though
I'm pretty sure most people just say 'en-teken'. I had never even heard of ampersand untill it was a question in a quiz a couple weeks ago
>	Was het leuk op het strand
Ik, een intellectueel:
>	Meh, &..
I use both terms but use 'en-teken' more because, as this thread shows, it is more well known and it is clear what you mean
'Ampersand' is the term I'd use to my fellow students in mathematics or CS related classes
> like most people i reaaaaaaally dont want the troubles to start again
this is something I'm wondering about: is there a genuine scare that the Troubles are going to start again and is there a rise in propaganda for unionism ?
As far as I know (and you probably know better than me), Norway doesn't rely on oil for its revenues

It's not part of the culture around here, but I have an uncle who is consistently 30 minutes late at family gatherings
So nowadays, we say to the rest of the family *"Oh, the party is at 14

30h."* That system works fine

I always wondered why
Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp and Liège were much more important cities throughout history
I just assumed it became rhz capital because of its central location and the fact that it is bilingual (I think it already was bilingual when Belgium became independent but I'm not sure)
This was after the Belgian revolution though
Also, the Spanish besieged and plundered Antwerp, leading to a massive braindrain from the south to the north
All wealthy merchants and other important people fled towards Amsterdam, leading to a massive surge in population and importance
In 1567 Antwerp had a population of about 105 000 people, Amsterdam had a population of 30 900 in 1564
After the Spanish Fury and siege, Antwerp had a population of 46 000 in 1591, while Amsterdam had a population of 59 551 in 1600, increasing more and more with the years
A lot of Flemish and Brabantian people fled to the Dutch Republic and had a massive impact on culture, language, wealth etc
Ik geef geen kloten

"BOEIEUH
It's short for "dit kan mij niet boeien". Literally "this can't handcuff me".
We have quite a few but in my region we also have like one word that just can be used for "fuck it/i don't care/don't give a damn shit" and that beautifull word is "Foert", since we have the rolling R in Flanders often, u ephasize on that r and roll it a bit extra "foerrt"
Also:
Het kan me geen moer schelen
-> It can't bother me a bolt/nut
Het kan me geen bal schelen
-> It can't bother me a ball
Het kan me een worst wezen
-> It could be a sausage to me
Dat kan me geen moer schelen
(Actually nice information though, but I don't think it matters in today's context, as little to no people know this and direct google translate wouldn't translate it as such)
Well, I was speaking about sayings in Belgium, so
and I'm pretty sure "moer" as moeder isn't used here at all
About 80% of the worlds billiard balls are made in Belgium
We had the first openly gay prime minister in Europe, Elio Di Rupo
Eventhough we are tiny we have the most castles, 3000 and the longest tram line in the world of 68km
We have the lowest salary gap between men and women in Europe
We host the worlds largest sand sculpture festival and electronic dance festival (tomorrowland), Europes largest cultural festival (Gentse feesten) and a ton of other music festivals (38 big ones and a lot of smallers ones)
“Fallen Astronaut” by the Belgian artist Paul Van Hoeydonck is the only piece of art on the Moon and oil painting was invented/reinvented by Jan Van Eyck
We are one of the best firearm prducers

The most translated books in the world, after the Bible, are those about Inspector Maigret by Georges Simenon from Liège

In Belgium, Flanders specifically, you can bet Home Alone 1 or 2 will be on TV during the holiday period

Actually, Lybians didn't have it bad under Khaddafi, it was the most developed country of North Africa, the ones with the highest standards of living
The ones who opposed Khaddafi were islamists
So, we should have fought alongside Khaddafi, not against him
Lybia is a mess now, much worse than under Khaddafi, which had made of Lybia the most succesful country of the Maghreb
Indeed, we can't compare the case of Catalonia with the Middle-East
If Russians support Russia, does this delegitimize Russia
I've heard Spanish speaking people literally say "Pardon de vous molester" (sorry to molest you) because molestar is to disturb/bother in Spanish
I don't have any example about people who learn dutch as a new language
But it's always weird to when people from the Netherlands speak with Belgians, because there's an overlap between what's informal in Dutch in Belgium and formal in Dutch in the Netherlands
Normally *U* (German Sie - French Vous) is the polite form
But it's also an informal declension of the older *Ge* form (Du - Tu), which isn't used in the Netherlands
It's like it always confuses them (the dutch), and they never seem to get it right
>Извините пожалуйста, вы не знаете где находиться библиотека?
In Russian class, can confirm I would ask it this way
Or maybe drop the не and находиться. How would you say it OP
the hardest thing any language is to know the little peculiarity like the one you mentioned
For myself I think the hardest thing for normaly strenger in french is soixante-dix et quatre-vingt-dix
In Colombia, I used the formal "su" for for everyone because you do the same in French
In Spain however, apparently, it's ok to use tu by default
Speaking of which, let's say I want to visit Russia some time, I understood that Russian people really appreciate when a foreigner tries to speak basic Russian
How would you say, for instance, "Hi, I'm a tourist, can I speak English
" in Russian
It's "juffrouw", there's no v in it
Ah yeah makes sense
Shorter and less overly formal
Septante and nonante exclusively
Never soixante-dix, huitante nor quatre-vingt-dix
Ah yeah usted is the word
Su is the possessive form right
I always mix these up for some reason
You know the hardest part of learning Spanish

As a small country citizen, I love the EU
They do all these things against big companies that we would never be able to do
Sadly their security is very much alleged and unproven, so in that regard little improvement over WhatsApp

It's funny but i don't like the fact that if it was any other ethnicity/nationality/other it would  be deemed racist and bigoted

A lot of people just don’t understand Western culture
Freedom of speech (and consequently of religion) *is* the right to offend
Frankly, I find a lot of aspects of Islam very offensive, but I will always defend your right to be a Muslim
More islamic community leaders need to hear this and repeat this
Why is this an issue
For example, if you criticize Jews, you're anti semitic and if you criticize the moslims and mock with them, you're talking of freedom of speech
That's just bullshit
When heavily accentuated, especially with a Parisian accent, it's quite vulgar
The systematic "-euh" sound that replaces the normally silent "e" or even no "e" at all ("bonjour-euh") and the engorged quality make it so
Southern accents are quite nice and euphonic though
i think its just not in sync
> There are plenty of muslims that embrace European values but those aren't on the news
"A lot" like plenty of people, sure, but not "a lot" like a sizable part of them
Check Pew research on values, it's frightening
Agreed
65% of Muslims in Europe say Sharia is more important than the law of the country they live in
And Sharia is not a joke, it's a pretty horrifying set of rules and values
There are plenty other surveys like that
The support for many unacceptable things is super high among Muslims, even in Europe
The road is still very long
it's a pity you don't see that
I'm not confused at all, I'm quoting serious surveys
And I'm not the one dragging the conversations toward emotions and prejudice, that's you
You're answering to data with anecdotes and still seem to see no problem with being smug
People in here with their 'innovation is dead now' crap
If a better charger type comes along that all manufacturers can use they can ask to make that one the standard
Also it's not for the port on your phone or tablet
Fuck you Apple
But chargers are already universal
Only the cables aren't. I guess it's a good thing power bricks will finally move away from the old USB  but it won't change much
I can charge my Android phone on Apple chargers already
Apple never circumvented anything because cooperation with the initiative was voluntarily
They also never included any sort of adapter and it certainly doesn’t cost €40
Brexit party, thank fuck it's the last day we have to hear their BS
This is from the point of a company that only cares about it's own profit and not innovation in general
They are free to innovate the standard
They don't need to sign anything for the law to apply to them
But it wasn’t a law from what I remember
It was an EU initiative and compliance with it was voluntary
It is quite pricy indeed, currently in their store at €25
because fins have strict rules on distance between people
Why would you want this art to considerate the freedom brought by cars when it is focused on how much space has been taken from pedestrians
Yeah, lately the pedestrian are getting very dangerous and jaywalking everywhere or literally waiting at the red light on the crosswalk path while it's green for the cars, I just drove a bit in the last hour and I witnessed this
all the cars swerved to dodge those idiots and nobody layed the horn because we're so used to them to be so entilted
Even worse the cyclists that absolutely have no clue about the circulation rules so just burns every red lights, ignore any priority but firmly believe that they got the right of the way every time because *bike*.
It's more and more unbearable to drive in the center of any EU western cities
It's hyperbolic
Of course the street is not a huge deadly hole
The vacuum represents unusable/unallocated dangerous space for pedestrians

I understand her point but I think player's salaries in football are always an easy point of attack
Messi and Ronaldo earn exceptionally high wages
But CEOs that manage big companies as well, just like them they are important to keep the company or the club afloat
Not a lot of people actually think about the money it brings into the economy
In flanders, belgium, our football clubs brought in around 700 million euros to the local economy alone
I think exceptional case is a vast understatement
In Spain footballers tend to get taxed over 40%. Is that not enough ?
I understand it perfectly well
But you're clearly missing the point
It's completely useless to complain that others earn more as this has nothing to do with the current issues
Not to mention that this is clearly some fake Facebook shit that some made up

Bit similar here (Belgium)
My grandfather had survived a lot (Tons of surgery + heart attacks)
Several times the doctors had said: he’s nog going to make it
Yet every single time he did
So when covid hit we were of course rightly worried
On top of that in oktober 2019 his wife/my grandmother had died (alzheimer)
The home were he lived went from no infections to almost everyone infected on a week
They locked everyone in their rooms so no one really saw anyone (besides nurses/doctors)
At first he was fine, still high in spirits
He did get infected but for about a week the symptoms were mild
Yet by the second week it got worse incredibly fast
They found him on the floor one day - he wasn’t really aware of his surrounding anymore
So they rushed him to the hospital
At the hospital the doctors said that probably wasn’t going to survive the night
They gave have pain medication to ease the pain
Yet he fought on for another full week
The doctors were honestly surprised and told us he was also always super friendly to the staff when he was awake/aware of his surroundings
He ended up passing away in his sleep, I hope peacefully in the end
My dad and my uncle were allowed to briefly see him (in full PPE) in the hospital (was surprised this was allowed), so at least they still saw him
For that uncle and my aunt and niece it was especially hard since they live in Japan
They only come to Belgium once a year, and in the end only my uncle got to say goodbye
Therefore when I see people calling this a hoax or flaunting the rules, frankly it disgusts me
Thank you
Hopefully you and your family are also doing fine
We got lucky with the funeral
We had to wait a while to have it but when we did Belgium had reopened and we could gather together (+sunny weather) as a family
Naturally we had plenty of food and a nice cake  (grandpa loved to eat and make huge cakes)
1 week after the funeral several countries limited travel to Belgium (most of my family doesn’t live here), so we got lucky

I know which npc will be in my next session
Hobgoblin Macron
It's about 70 years after you guys deposed their democratically elected moderate leader and installed a dictator which eventually lead to the Iranian revolution in 1979 and the current leadership coming to power
Thanks USA
Great job
Belgium should be "no data" as well, as it's to difficult to make a nationwide conclusion from separate Flemish and Wallonian data
What a random scale

Almost three years worth of young people's voices who will now be ignorned despite Brexit not going anywhere
Great bit of democracy there
And I know stupid people will misinterpret this but no my logic isn't that we should get another vote for every year of a new batch of people getting the right to vote but when its been three years along with the fact that Brexit is not going anywhere and been a complete mess it makes sense to have another vote
Lets also not forget that no one knew what they were voting for to begin with and votes were made on nothing but guesses on what was right rather than hard facts about Brexit that we have accuquired now

You got good people on both sides, though admittedly everyone is losing their minds right now
Yesterday was the warmst 16th of February ever in Belgium
I live in Belgium and I've had a few weeks ago a giant ass wasp getting inside my bedroom, like what the hell‽
It didn't even freeze here yet
Imagine how hot summer will be
Brussels, Belgium here
We didn't have any negative celsius temperature so far, or any snow
Last year we had negative celcius temperature for a few dats, but the snow lasted for one single day
We don't need to count snow days in Belgium anymore
Or days with freezing
Even the times the car windows are frozen is single digit where I live the last few years
Ground water levels on the other hand are bad
The rain of the last weeks just made it less bad but still not back to normal
Absolute madlad
Google "Farage Le Pen".
Oh I know, that's true
I didn't mean to imply Farage was part of the official leave campaign, just that he was a prominent campaigner for the Brexit argument, and we can't say that "Brexiteers did not give a fig about whether other countries wanted to stay or leave" (which is what the original comment said)
WTF decided to vote yes on this ?
Doubtful
It's not even on the Hungarian news

Warsaw 1944
The Red Army let the city rot while they wait outside its gates
The Polish  Home Army (Resistance) starts an uprising against the Nazi's. Fighting spans over two months
Results:
200
000 civilians death in Warsaw alone
700
000 refugees from Warsaw alone
And if that wasn't yet enough, the Nazi's destroyed the entire city center with dynamite
Then the Red Army casually strolled in
Estimated population in 1935: 1
2 million
Why is the world full of idiots
Let’s start:
1: he’s wearing extreme nationalist ensigns all over his clothes
2: his fingers are fully closed and together with the arm fully stretched, nobody waves like that
3: He’s looking right at the camera
You're describing ethno-nationalism, not nationalism as in anti-globalism
So Brexit wasn't a referendum questioning Britain's sovereignty but was in fact solely racist at its core
Now look, I get that the news cycle around Brexit and the EU has been dominated by the topic of immigration and the payments by the UK to the EU and that a lot of this was plain false
There's no doubt about the propaganda perpetrated there
But as someone with a masters in European Studies, from a pure political point of view, there **are** a lot of unanswered questions in regards to the EU's encroachment of national sovereignty
It's an ongoing debate, but there's equally no doubt about the UK's constant historic and cultural opposition to furthering European integration
It's not a question that can be answered by simply pointing at racism and propaganda
It's a society-wide philosophical question of identity and it is very much relevant to contemporary politics in the face of ever increasing globalization
This make me smile

Speaking from Belgium, the high speed trains are here, the tracks are here, they were largely funded by public money, but then neoliberalists demanded that they be harbored in self sustaining solvent companies and the best way to do that is to brand high speed rail as some luxury option for business travelers and tourists
When really, the infrastructure is suitable to serve as a solution for commuting
But then you need to stop selling numbered placed, sell yearly subscriptions and increase train frequency by a lot
Not something these semi-private companies are able to do in the structures they were forced into
Just shifting taxes isn't going  to fix this
Trains should be treated as a public good and their offering tailored to benefit the most people possible
I've been to China, where the trains are subsided heavily
Could do over 1000kms in 5 hours for €90 on a bullet train
If the EU were to make a network of such trains it would help a lot
Just
only connect the major cities to it
Otherwise it misses the point
E.g. Sevilla - Barcelona - Bordeau - Paris - Brussels - Amsterdam
The state of train transportation for a densely populated area like Europe is unbelievably bad
Nations need to work closer together when it comes to high speed international travel, and they need to make it way more affordable
To be honest, airplane travel between European nations (at least Western and Central Europe) should be scaled down way more
Do indeed heavily tax non-transcontinental flights and use that tax to increase the quality and ranges of the european rail network
High-speed rail is not designed to host commuters
Not in Belgium, not in France, not even in Japan
More subsidies might entice some upper class and upper middle class commuters, but that's it
Nationalisation won't change a thing
Japan's HSR is run by privatised companies whereas France has publicly and privately run HSR
Either way they're too expensive for the vast majority of commuters
They're just trains
There's nothing magical about them that would make them unsuited for commuters
there's trains running every day that could take me from my home to a job in Rotterdam in under an hour, but it's completely un-affordable
Stupid artificial way of stifling the economy imho
why can't I just get on the train when I want to like any normal train
We're such weak fucks for putting up with this bs
It's unaffordable because these trains are very expensive to run
HSR is far more expensive than conventional rail both to build and to operate
HSR operators worldwide aren't just randomly jacking up prices for the sake of it
Good, let's stop with importing US problems

Why does everyone want everything cheaper, buying cheap clothes thanks to child labor, ...? This is gonna destroy the EU
who wants to bet we will find out in a few months that Russia has been funding and promoting these protests
&#x200B;
that's not the point, it's your democratic duty to protest  when something is clearly not in the intrest of the majority of the people
It's is also your duty to be skeptical and doubtfull with people inciting hate/violence/anger
just have a look yourself which hashtags have been the most popular amongst known russian propaganda accounts:
even if there is a genuine purpose to these protests, know that there are people out there who just want to see them escalate and create division and chaos
Mental how such a small piece of paper can trigger the Brexit snowflakes

But I can be wrong, even 2 pictures can't completely tell the story
I try to exhaust all other options before attributing something to malice
(still have a sliver of hope for humanity
Edit: to clarify
This is still police violence towards non-violent protesters
I just don't think this was politically motivated like some other commenters believe
I can see how my intial post could have been taken as me trying to find an excuse for this officer
You're not wrong
Fascists love plausible deniability
Which makes it extra hard for us to call them out
Let's try not to attack our friends in the confusion
This police officer is "just doing his job", and I think the problem here is not the fascists in power beating and macing their opposition in the face, but rather the police beating and macing non-violent protesters in the face
I think regardless of who would have stood before him and who was in power, thet officer would have sprayed
That's the problem here (at least based on these 2 pics)

There's Stalingrad Avenue in Brussels

It's going really well I think
they got to count till they knew who won, even though the ruling president really didn't like it
but he couldn't do anything except go to the courts, which is good, that's his right
But if the judge says no, it's no, even if you're president
Picking kamela as his vp was either a brilliant move to rake left votes, which I suspect the lack thereof was a factor in Hillarys defeat, or a geniuene attempt towards improving the life of the working man

Trump destabilizing effects on the world will linger for years to come, so I for one am happy he is not given legitimacy by getting a 2nd mandate
And if all that doesn't sound like an improvement at the very least we, the rest of the world (who forced trump down our throats by mass media), will no longer have to hear the manchild speak, read his incoherent tweets or be staggered by the fact he cannot admit even the simplest mistake
We know cofeffe was you fat fingering don
We know that the sharpie gate was you trying to contribute to a conversation you knew nothing off
No more will he get to self insert In the tiniest things, and I welcome the peace of mind that is at the end of the road
With the changes of the last 20 years the president does have a lot more power now than ever before though
(for some reason giving one man a lot of power is a good thing
I don't get it)
As a result he can actually do a lot with executive orders and such
The bigger problem is that 4 years from now everything is going to go to shit again I think
Biden isn't a strong candidate
He's just better than Trump by a long shot
He's talking soft power
Ow, he's fucking awful
He's just better than Trump
This is a 4 year gap
Either the Dems over there do something with it and find something to root for instead of against
Or we have another Republican in 4 years
take all the crazy conspiracies about the state being controlled by soros and Jews and mix that with satanism hysteria and everyone I don't like is a pedo
But the 50 year old trucker listens to Glenn Beck and if Democrats suggest an actual solution to his issues, he will be convinced it's part of a communist plot to take over the country
The only reason to vote Biden imo
If that's your top concern, Biden is your guy in this case
It still saddens me that global warming is a political issue at this point
> That would be like funding Al-Qaeda to fight ISIS
2022: Vote republican "to keep the president honest"(midterms tend to go against whatever party is president)
2024: Democrats still morons and Republicans still racist
Racists win by default
I mean, I would be willing to bet €100 on this
Republican gains in senate in 2022 and Republican president in 2024
I mean, I don't disagree there
Romney for example wouldn't be the worst thing
I do question if he still has a chance though because of the last 4 years of criticizing Trump
They fought ISIS as well
Big clusterfuck over there
Yea, the first 2 years is just Republicans going full obstruction
They're going to point out Biden didn't keep his promises
And that's all they need to do
Plus some more right leaning democrats that wanted him out of office as well
Could work
A more left republican party(read: not fucking bananas) might also allow the democrats to go more left(hell, it could plainly force them to)
Long live First Past the Post
And to think that De Wever said that us in Belgium should consider taking cues from the US election system
Fuck that shit
Yea, I just want to know what's it going to be in 4 years against Biden(if he runs)
The Romney/Caine type or the Trump/Hogan type

There’s a comment in this thread about a man Who left that place at 17 years old to study in S.P. He Said his parents and him love it there for the reasons I stated
Well no, not really

Indeed, there’s not much to do

Its a kind of nostalgic love
This is what I don't get
How don't people realize that, if you promote women because they are women, you *establish* the preconception that women are less competent than men
The logic is extremely simple:
* Your team is supposed to have the most competent people available
* You give women a slight advantage over men, because women are not particularly common in this field but you strive to have at least a certain number of women in your team
* As a consequence, women are hired with lower standards than men
* As a consequence, men have to be more competent than women in order to join your team
* As a consequence, **the men in your team are more competent than the women in your team**.
* The result: everyone in your team feels like men are more competent than women
* Congratulations, you are now part of the problem while you were trying to be part of the solution
I don't understand how you can be a manager in a company and *not* realize this
I disagree
If I've learned anything in my education (organizational psychology) about hiring people, it's that the selection process is not about choosing the one who seems to be the absolute best person
It's mainly about weeding out candidates that are unfit for the job
If you have five people in the end phase, selected out of hundreds of applicants, it won't have a big impact who you choose
Definitely don't justify your pick by bringing in gender or race, but at that stage just pick the person with the best fit for the company
Someone you can work with, that fits the company culture you need
Some research even indicates that the ones that score higher on aptitude tests or did better on their degrees, will feel more entitled to the job and will try to prove themselves less than people who were slightly less qualified
And selection tools aren't all that accurate for predicting performance on the job
Not everything translates well to a quantified variable
Valid point

Which is exactly how most European legislations handle free speech
You are allowed to express your opinion, but hate speech is forbidden
Regardless of this man's political views, brining the Nazi salute in Germany is forbidden by law

maybe he wasn't a random person but someone paid to do this, in order for them to have a "reason" to fast track something to appease lobby money ? We'll see, if this news just disappears in a few weeks
Very effective
Does that mean we must bow to our drone overlords now
I hoped we’ll have more time
Or was it just incompetence and mental castration of British services and army
Shooting this drone down would be a discrimination against drones and their culture maybe
That would explain a lot
Pretty accurate for Belgium, except there's 6 of them that are all slightly different, with their own governments but also one for all of Belgium, and the same party can be both in a government and an opposition at the same time
Otherwise, pretty accurate
Honestly pretty accurate lol
Liberal is neither conservative, nor progressive
Communist would be the opposite of liberal although not entirely
Most liberals in Europe could be better described as capitalists
As most Western European countries are liberal (in the old meaning) and socio-capitalist welfare states, most capitalists (liberals) are somewhat socialist and most socialist are somewhat capitalist
Most debates are in essence about where the equilibrium between socialism and capitalism should be
as a belgian, both the socialism duo and the racist duo is humorously accurate
In Belgium the liberal conservatives took also the seats of the covert rascists
It's the only real party name in there
Populist=covert racist
Tho if we dub em liberal conservatives i'd say to keep in mind they are only partially economically liberal and partially socially liberal
Same goes for the conservatism
Also the covert racists really aren't all that covert given all the shit prominent members have done whilst being allowed to remain in the party
I don't think there are "proper right" parties that don't fall into "liberal and conservative
" "Christians" and "covert racists"
the area around Berlin even has a desert according to another poster here
Do Putin next
For a moment, I thought Denmark had a sign language person (can't think of the right term)
It's really fun to watch
I think it's supposed to be a much needed sign that the EU and USA are still mostly sharing the same interests and there will be less moves where the USA doesn't warn the EU like Trump did
At least that's what I assume Biden is present for, I've got no idea if they were actually discussing a topic involving the USA
The drones are invading
Brilliant
Amazing human being, regardless of what I, or anyone for that matter, think of his beliefs

>They were the only ones that were against Germany from start to finish, so they were absolutely essential
The Munich agreement disagrees
Nobody Said anything like: ‘(nation) defeated Germany all by itself
Were just measuring who contributed what
And it is obvious that when you look at pure statistics, the USSR contributed the most
But they deffinetly Did not win on their own
The Soviets Most casualties were in te beginning of the war against Germany
After That, they still suffered But on the other hand, the Germans suffered more during their retreat all the way to Berlin

In countries that regularly have weather like this people stay inside (or at least avoid hotspots like this place in Delft), public transport doesn't ride out, etc

It's probably fake, but if it was real, I would assume they are inside jokes and pop culture references rather than actual questions
Which is why they are in English: people are probably more likely to Google such questions in their own language if they actually care about the questions themselves

^help
Meanwhile Ireland is overcast but nice
Kinda glad about it
my parents came home a day early from verdun because shit was utterly fucked there
I live in Belgium and I cant even
Never before have I experienced this
Its scary tbh
UR NEXT
Went outside for 10 minutes during lunch
Felt like walking into an oven
One of my colleagues was on a train that was stuck for 2 hours yesterday
If that happens to me, fuck it, but I'm smashing windows
Can't go outside, but also can't stay inside
Being in work with their airco is actually a relief
kill me now !
But what do we do when its 45° all summer in a decade
I'm gonna start blowing up our bridges just to be safe though
That doesn't change anything as there is no one living in that neighbourhood
It's still the ultimate form of freedom
There's no freedom in running to don't be late for your bus or train and it's fucking miserable to cycle in a freezing cold rain
Fucking scum
Also great job proving Macron was right in what he did
Hope he steps it up
Get these people out of our continent
We brought peace to Europe after ending our endless wars, only for the Intolerant extremist fundamentalists to come here and behead us
I don’t stand with that
Ah yes ! Of course, and because of American Self Defense laws, things like this never happen in the US
All single school shootings were avoided with zero deaths in the last 30 years because of your great self defense laws
Radicalisme grows well in good earth
The radicalisme can only thrive because the soil is kept wet by the 5
7 million quiet majority
I know it's not a popular opinion, but in Belgium the MP's also referred to dancing Muslims after the attacks in Zaventem
Don't act like this is an issue of the "last years". In France alone + 270 people died in the last 20 years in the hands of Islam Radicalist, because thats what they are, not terrorist alone
It's uncontrolled multiculturalism and politic correctness that has brought us this mess
A childish believe by the former generation of politicians, that when you mix cultures at the end of the ride, they all share beers together in the park under a bright rainbow
Enough is enough
It's sad that the far right is the only party screaming against it, I don't want that either, but still, you need a means to a solution
And this solution will not be free and easy
History shows you, you treat violence with violence
Europe is too soft, too soft on goddamn anything
It's the best place in the world to live, it's an example on many issues for the rest of the world
What is it worth, if you don't protect it
A project almost a  century in the making and now throwing it away for what
I want my children growing up in an Europe with the values that I grew up with, because they are right and brought social security to millions of peoples here
This kind of behavior by Religious Idiots (because that, and only that is what they are) doesn't have a place in this society
Not once, not even let alone accepting it 100 times in the last 30 years
For fuck sakes
Wake up
Things have not been  looking good for years, the only problem is, everybody is ignoring it for years
It has to be dealt with
> Given current demographic trends
Nope
> [...] a “high” migration scenario projects the record flow of refugees into Europe between 2014 and 2016 to continue indefinitely into the future with the same religious composition (i.e., mostly made up of Muslims) in addition to the typical annual flow of regular migrants
In this scenario, Muslims could make up 14% of Europe’s population by 2050
It would literally take more than 200 years for the muslim population in Europe to become a majority if current trends continued
And they probably won't. Hell, the current fertility rate for the muslim population in Europe is barely above replacement rate, at 2

Stop your fearmongering
Explain yourself
Shun, denounce and report the rotten apples
Their inaction is their own undoing; they will suffer for it, while the extremists celebrate their martyrdom
Those acts keep nudging people towards people that don't tiptoe around the issue, eventually they come into power and will take action
And it won't be pleasant
And nobody is going to speak out for the moderate muslims, as they themselves didn't speak out against their extremists
It's nightmare fuel
It could range from mere closed borders and forced repatriations to pogroms where police is told to stand down or even organized rounding up of unwanted elements
God knows we Europeans can be quite efficient if we set our mind to something
It's really up to the larger Muslim community to solve this issue asap
It's in their own best interest
I never had any doubts whether the question was genuine :) Cheers
[What would make cycling safer
They're all far more important than wearing a helmet
In The Netherlands, literally almost nobody wears a helmet, including kids (aside from *very* young kids) and cycling is safer in The Netherlands than anywhere
Not to mention, forcing cyclists to wear a helmet sends the message:"cycling is dangerous" into the world which makes some people stop cycling and switch to driving instead (this happened in both Sweden and Australia) which makes the road more dangerous for everyone
If people want to wear a helmet, by all means, but governments should never even run a campaign to encourage people to wear a helmet as even that causes cycling rates to drop and driver rates to rise
If governments are so concerned about cyclists they should give them proper infrastructure
Is extending your hand a law in The Netherlands
Here some people do it, but it's not required
This would be a great post for /r/PeopleFuckingDying
So all we need to defeat an American infantry unit is 80 Norwegian school kids on a snowy day
Damn you Nordics most likely have some records beating the US
Another (serious) example is this [Swedish submarine] It has a sterling engine and is so silent it has beaten the US in submarine war games
[Here another use for it]
We didn't use to be involed in the Ukraine conflict
We're still not, be we used to too
Putin is extremely predictable, just hard to contain or deal with
"They were overenthousiastic volunteers who happened to bring SAM's with them
A very succinct summary
I really didn't have an opinion on brexit, one way or another, but after *years* of passive-aggressive cringy shit like that it becomes more and more sensible
Please remind me in which country the capital of Europe is
If this is all it takes for you to make your mind up on Brexit, you’re a moron
Really, you just admitted having no opinion on it, probably because you’ve never actually thought or looked into what it would actually mean, but somehow *this* cartoon swayed you one way
Utterly ridiculous
You’d fit right in with most Leave voters
Belgium then
> they can’t admit
I would say that you're the one using feelings and bias
In reality we must admit that we just don't know
Brexit hasn't happened
Maybe it will be cataclysmic, maybe it will be hardly noticeable
Until then the *"you're so stupid and mean to leave us"* could stop, it doesn't help anyone
let's avoid winter war II, this time it's nuclear
Or they fucked up their inventory and didn't have anything ready for the grand opening
The good old days of queueing for an empty store
Why would you think that
Socialism means that the worker owns the mean of production
This means that there isn't some cooperate backroom meeting that is trying to figure out how much stock value they are going to lose researching in different chemicals
There is also some greedy fuck somewhere that is counting his years and money and says: "Meh, I am not going to live long enough for this to become my problem".
Yes, I am socialist in this cooperate/capitalist shithole that we call the western world
If you think I deserve to die, don't worry I think the same about myself ... . The only reason I carry on, is because I want to see how far capitalist are going to be able to push it, I want to experience true cyberpunk and then I guess I will just jump of a bridge somewhere ... .
That's true
Insects are the most important multicellular animals in the world
People know that bees are important, but often forget about the other pollinators like wasps, beetles, midges etc
Not to mention the colossal ecological role that those animals play
A world without insects is a *very* different world
> The Soviet Union, Venezuela, Laos, Vietname, Cambodia
the list goes on
Those countries you named never experienced true marxism socialism
The soviet union had some twisted form that was called lenism
Venezuela looks like a capitalist country with a socialist party at power
Vietnam did not stop being communistic after the US left, however the people never owned the means of production
> No, this means trying to understand the needs of the people instead of the markets, which result in empty shelves
I don't get it
If you try to understand what people need it is pretty obvious that they need something to eat
Why would this result in empty shelves
In a Market it is more profitable to figure out what the highest bidder wants, and try to produce that as **cheap** as possible
> And there are greedy fucks in socialist countries, counting their millions, laughing at you
If a "socialist" country has greedy fucks that are capable of exploiting the system for themselves
Then it has failed to implement it properly
The problem with socialism is that it never ever has been able to be implemented properly because as soon you get a socialist commune/country it is free real estate for capitalist countries
What is also the reason why they will try to shield themselves from the world
Yes, but very few animals can adapt in such a short time period
>  Keep trying, you socialists will get it one day
I also hope you get to experience the full free market as well
And I know that we are mostly talking theoretical thingies, while the market is tested and it "works". So excuse us socialists for being vague, it isn't as clear for us as it is for you
our numbers are not that representative either
Belgium has stopped testing regular people with symptoms, we only test those considered at risk or clearly deteriorating
our numbers are basically counting only whoever shows up at the hospital (and the healthcare workers), the rest is told to stay home and quarantine themselves
but yes at least all our experts and politicians are clearly stating on the news that this is the case and you should expect there to be many more cases out there
I wonder if the cultural differences in terms of touching eachother during interactions etc play a role
Did it spread faster in Italy because they are more expressive that way perhaps

(edit, yes, thank you reddit, after being told 30 times, I now know putin speaks german
Wouldn't she be as a former east German official
How is trump an idiot
Very probably
There is talk of tabling a UN resolution that condemns the NK missile as an "intercontinental ballistic missile", [but Russia says "we cannot confirm that the missile can be classified as an ICBM"] So possibly Putin is Putinsplaining to Merkel how her little rocket trajectory movement is incorrect
Notice how he nods no after her arm movement, and she then rolls her eyes
Massive respect for the man
That's admirable
This is some deathstar architecture

It's actually  trial they are running on one specific major road for a while to see what the effect is
I don't think it works for infractions that would lead to an immediate withdrawal/suspension of your license
Any idea what the plan is
Will they remove the old road or document it and cover it back up
The latter one is something often done in Belgium when possible
Potholes are cool OK
> The reason the roads are great in Romania

I'm not sure how to interpret this comment
My first reaction to read is that half of the people that take a trip on a romanian road but i'm pretty sure that's not what you're trying to say
Ireland is full of firebush
Doom
More Italian
Remove the Ferrari, add 4 cars, 5 Vespas and a onlooking Carabinieri, all standing on top of stop line
Also, remove the Coliseum in the background and add 5 busses with Asian and American tourists
FTFY
State of road is definitely as Italian as it gets
Need more pizza, wine and hand gestures
Must be a regional thing, I've seen more Fiat 500s and Dacia in th north of Italy and of course a lot of panda but not as much than the 500s
I'm amazed there's a lot of pictures of big roads and little people on them (as in little carriage, but also very few people walking)
but then it's norway so maybe it's still that way there
I find it interesting to think about how much human life changes, or doesn't. Technologically, we're just on a different level from even a few hundred years ago it seems, but at the same time you can read something like Marcus Aurelius' meditations and still feel like it's relevant to our life almost 2000 years later
I'm very disappointed we're not on the list
Come on, we host the EU and NATO
Something must be off here
Wow, many former USSR countries
It's almost as if a bunch of them are neighbours they treated like shit in the past
I didn't know countries had reddit accounts
Gonna go against the stream here, but no, most aren't. Most vote for nationalistic Russian leaders, including Putin
Putin his support was actually wavering, with nationalistic Russian political movements protesting against him in earlt 2010s. It's to appease that significant part of the Russian population that Russia started this entire expansionist path, starting with the war in Georgia
Then the unlawfull annexation of Crimea, now this escalation of the war in Ukraine
A lot of Russians are very nationalistic and are supportive of the [Ruskkiy Mir] (Big Russia) idea

A Croatian family walking in Brussels
This is next to where I live, all my local bars
Really nice place, especially in the summer when everyone's outside
It's the Parvis de St Gilles, in 1060 Brussels
There are some seriously salty French people in this thread, because we (Belgians) decided not to root for them and instead cheer for the Croatians
Do you not see that this is normal
Croatia was in the same position as Belgium this World Cup: an underdog team that hasn't ever reached the final but has the promise of a very good team
Of course we're going to cheer for Croatia
They got to second place, while we could not
Don't worry French, we don't hate you
But do understand that we're not going to support you in the finale
I would applaud too
Croatia played amazing and if our Red Devils would have met them at any point in the cup, I would be biting my nails
Croatia is an amazing team and you can never ever let your gaurd down while playing them
Pfff 1060, it's 1000 or nothing
Too hot in Finland
Like 14 degrees
not allowed sry, go torch some car somewhere instead :)
Why can't it be both
Rooting for Croatia because they played so well and because you don't want the french to win
It's not toxic
There are plenty of Americans here
And there is this neighborhood in Brussels where everyone speaks English
It's called the European Quarter it's where all expats go when they arrive
You're very welcome to join the gang

You're welcome
Yes for sure
It's less touristy than the Grand Place area
Lots of young professionals live there, students, very multicultural, a bit gritty
Check out the original Moeder Lambic, all the bars on the Parvis, Dillens, etc ...
Place Flagey in Ixelles is also worth checking out

Obligatory "The HuMan EyE CaN onLy sEe 24fps" hurr durr
They aren't in the military
They're cadets
These specifically only started a couple of weeks ago
They'll only have had a couple of "gatherings".
Nah, unlike you guys, we don't like starting wars that destroy the continent
These aren't soldiers but cadets
They likely didn't receive any meaningful training yet
These aren't conscripts though
They're cadets - people who receive military training outside the work hours as a hobby
These one specifically were recruited a couple of weeks ago
They probably only just received their uniform let alone spent a lot of time learning how to march, etc
Also these people aren't in the military, so they won't even be involved with war
So like every other country with colonies then
these last 2-3 weeks have been so weird weather wise
I just want to let this out
I'm a Belgian but you have to understand the German need for energy
They are an economic powerhouse, they need energy
And they know as well that Russia isn't an ideal deliverer, but here I am and here I need to do some Realpolitik
And the Germans, especially Merkel, know a lot about dealing with just this

Massive piece of shit, that's true
But Hungary is hardly a big player in the EU
His power lies in the fact that his EU representative can veto whatever new stuff EU brings to the table, but he can't impose or destroy laws of the EU
In short, he's an issue for internal affairs of the EU, not external like Boris is for the UK or Trump was for the USA
Edit: clarity
>But the President is constitutionally empowered to conduct foreign policy and to negotiate treaties
Yes, and the guy is suggesting an alternative to that
Constitutional amendments and such
> How could he get approval before the terms of the treaty were decided upon
What about getting approval after the terms are negotiated by the president
Right wing populists will always exist I'm afraid, but so far Western Europe and Scandinavia are doing fine with keeping them out of high positions, while Eastern/Southern Europe is trying to flush them out

BREAKING: During day 5 of the EU Council Summit, a coronavirus recovery fund deal was reached at 5:31 AM Brussels Time
Euro-sceptic are always going to complain unless you give them a bag of cash
It's not really something to listen to
This deal came out on our national day (today July 21st), so that's extra cool :-)
It's all fantasy
Economy isn't a hard science
In Belgium, people are seeing an increase in the money they receive monthly from the government if they can't work
We'll see how things evolve, I suppose
These are difficult times for governments all over the world
Not in this case
People out of a job already receive welfare benefits like they always have
Investment should only really ramp up after the virus has been convincingly dealt with
Certain proposed increases were cut or watered down
Nothing that already existed was actually cut
Also, it seems like we *finally* got a breakthrough in our government formation
Yay

>The Muslim world is always very good at finger pointing and preaching what is good or what should or should not happen but for over 500 years no Islamic country has contributed to world peace, human freedom and/or innovation by any measurable global standard
It's ironic to see people from the west take the moral high ground when the west (ok, mostly the US) has spent the past 7 decades overthrowing democratically elected leaders, staging coups, and bombing the middle east to absolute shit because there's a lot of oil
Indonesia, the country with the most Muslims in the world, is doing just fine relatively to other countries
You know what they lack
**Oil**.
Maybe if we want the middle east, and by proxy most of the Muslim world, to no longer be a shitshow, maybe we could stop funding fucking dictators in Saudi Arabia and Iran by buying their oil so that they can't keep shitting on the rest of the middle east
But noooooo
Condemn the Muslim world
But then sponsor shitstains like the Saudis by driving your gasoline guzzling car without questioning it
>most muslims feel empowered/proud after these atrocious attacks,.
There are 1
7 billion Muslims in the world
I sincerely doubt "most Muslims" have even heard about this attack
If you're talking about Muslims in France, source
>Why as an Islamic nation does Indonesia have Indonesian individuals earning 11 million USD a day and there are still people in the country that eat 1 meal a day and earn just over 2 USD a day
Same reason you see it in Congo
Same reason you see it in every undeveloped country
Corruption
It doesn't mean that Muslims inherently are bad
>Nothing to that scale would float in any Northern European country, our ancestors had that shit show in the Middle Ages and don’t want that crap ever again
So because us white Europeans were the first to develop and progress as societies (on the back of exploiting numerous other countries well into the 20th century), that makes other cultures inherently inferior
>There’s a reason many Islamic elitists love Trump and sponsor him
Are you fucking equating Islamic elites to the Islamic culture as a whole
So that means I can assume that Trump is representative for white people culture as a whole
Damn, us white people sure are a bunch of douchebags
>At some point the excuses must run out snd accountability should be held where it’s due
Where's the acountability for every western citizen that is sponsoring terrorist regimes like the Saudis by buying their oil to drive their cars
We're sponsoring the very regime that is funding whabbism bullshit all across the world
Where's the accountability
>Be critical of all power structures but start with your own and measure them the same way as you would the country you moved to
What the fuck
I'm white as fuck and Belgian as fuck
My family has lived here for generations
I simply don't see it as simplistic as:"Islam/Muslims bad, just look at Middle East".
>You have no problems putting all Americans in the same bag
Where the fuck did I put all Americans in the same bag LOL
When I mentioned the US, I was talking about their government
Did you think that I argued that every single American citizen went and invaded the Middle East
That's ludicrous
Americans are fine
I don't even condemn them for electing Trump (even though he's a total shithead)
It had a lot more to do with economic anxiety than racism
>you don't like it when people do the same to Muslims
I don't like people generalizing an entire population group based on their religion or ethnicity, but **I'm** the bad guy here
Are you sure that you belong in our western society
Because pretty sure that not discriminating people based on ethnicity or religion is a pretty core fucking value of western society
>If your point is that those Muslim countries have an anti-Christian mentality because of the attacks in their countries (which are totally unrelated to religion anyway, if they are pissed then they can go after the US for their jihad and see how well that goes), it is not for innocent people to pay the price and the more the reason to not let them into Europe
What you're asking is for them to be rational
Even though people are inherently irrational
Case in point: the generalizations of **all** Muslims that you're doing based on the actions of a small minority
Maybe practice what you preach first
>I am baffled how the more left thinking people are somehow defending killing in the name of religion in the 21st century
I didn't defend any killing for shit
I simply oppose blanket generalizations of an entire population group based on ethnicity or religion
And I'll keep fighting over that hill for as long as I'm alive
>A religion where anywhere you go gay people are non-existent (or else) and women are little better than dogs
In Uganda, being gay is punishable by death
Uganda is over 90% Christian
Are you advocating that we deport all Christians too
If not, why only generalize all Muslims, not all Christians
/u/djolera got banned according to further comments on his account
That's just
crazy
>However I am ruthlessly critical of the power structures in one of my Islamic cultures
So am I.
What I am also critical of is the complete shitshow that integration has been in most of western Europe when it comes to Muslim migrants
We basically ignored them, allowed them to congregate in poor neighborhoods, and now we're wondering why they're not integrating
Meanwhile, my friend who was born here and is a Belgian citizen by birth, faces discrimination every week because of his skin color
And we keep wondering why they don't integrate
Maybe because they consistently are reminded that they don't *really* belong here

It's proven over and over again that this data is used to segregate gift giving by social class
There is no other reason why the children born in higher class incomes receive greater quantity and more expensive gifts
It's a clear sign of misuse of data to discriminate

Hello to you too, fellow Crusader Kings 2 player
I don't want to discredit the title, but I seem to [recal] that the number of protestors was significantly down
Also it's not really a protest against Putin himself, but against a deemed unfair decision to discredit the validity of a number of signatures politicians required to take part in Moscow elections
NOw I haven't checked up on it, so it could be that the number is indeed growing

I don't know what's more fucked up about this chart: that the USA has never gone under their April peak or the last 7 days exponential growth in Europe
Every single day I see idiots on social media claiming there is no pandemic
And the other half is due to Belgium
You would think we Belgians should be capable of setting a good example, having the 'capital of the EU' and all that
But instead we're basically burning it all down here
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our European dead
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of covid blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let masks cover the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful rulers,
Now set the teeth and don't stretch the nostril wide,
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height
On, on, you noblest europeans
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you
Be copy now to men of noble blood,
And teach them how to prevent
And you, good pleb,
Whose limbs were made in europe, show us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base,
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start
The game's afoot:
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
Cry 'God for coin, Europe, and multinationals
Yes, why don't we just go on vacation to Germany/France/Nederlands/whatever and never wear a mask, I mean if my government doesn't see me, then why should I care

If belgians would have to stop, all that's left is staring at each other uncomfortably until someone left

I always call it out as a joke whenever someone brings up the weather to fill an otherwise awkward silence
What's wrong with silence people
So, do these papers have the attitude of:
We're going to constantly come up with the most outrageous things to say and even anyone so much as even sighs at it, we claim we're being oppressed, our freedom of speech being attacked
Because honestly, that's pathetic, and acting in bad faith
And then people are surprised other people start thinking in bad faith about everything

Well, I get what you’re saying but this is China we’re talking about

The only way to force them is through government trade sanctions but due to our dependence on Chinese trade the governments don’t dare to do things like that
In other words; people don’t do anything against the concentration camps because they cannot do anything without sacrifice

I don't know about the "earn 29% more money".  They probably took the average of all incomes in the US, which includes many billionaires and even more millionaires

But as far as sanctioning goes it's a good question to ask considering it's something that the US and EU in general do: sanctions on Russian, sanctions on China, sanctions on Iran etc
It's a logical question to ask, if hypothetically
Actually sanctioning an ally is ofcourse something different
(though the US is kinda doing that now with the whole Iran situation)

I didn't pay parking when I went to school with my car because fines over a week were cheaper than paying for parking
It was almost as costly every day to get a fine than it was to pay but I only got like 2 fines every week
Lowest fines I had ever seen yea
€20
I think they raised it to €50 now
It's been 10 years
The point is basically to raise fines imo
If it was €100 I would just pay
You can argue it's immoral but ignoring human nature is just foolish imo

Generally speaking the people most invested in politics are the ones that lean to extremes

Expecting your citizens to show up to vote once every two years is not a huge crime
Welcome to the club of having no government soon xD
If there even is any(?), the "PR budget" for the EU is extremely low
It's pretty much just a bureaucracy working in the background, pushing money around to where it thinks its helpful
There's no branch of it dedicated to PR work or such
If there was, that would be seen negatively as a waste of money
I'm an eurosceptic at heart, but there's no denying the many good things the EU does fund
They just generally suck at letting anyone know they are actually doing good things
If it devolves into using China/Russia methods that would just inflame anyone who's not a raving PRO-EU  follower
It does interfere enough with sovereign nations as is, and while mostly positive in nature, any shift towards authoritarian methods will just erode it's purpose and swell the ranks of anti-EU parties, quite a few of which are not particularly desirable on a national level either

Český in this case means Bohemian, not Czech
It is meant to distinguish it from places in other Czech regions with the same name
Yes, I was referring to the contemporary meaning of Bohemia - the western part of the Czech Republic
No, I am not wrong
Český can refer to the region of Bohemia or to all of the Czech lands (Čechy vs
Česko - same adjective)
Český Krumlov means Krumlov in the region of Bohemia, as opposed to Moravský Krumlov in the region of Moravia

It's almost as if cities were designed for people, not for cars
I think that the bikes fiets the place better
I think once we get rid of the car as the main mode of transport in condensed human activity areas (such as cities you see here), most cities will become more human friendly again
That's so great to see
Hopefully the rest of the world won't lag behind in the upcoming decades
It's really fascinating to see how the 50's, 60's, 70's there was this massive development of the current road infrastructure in most developed countries and how subsequently city infrastructure was adapted for cars
But only in the Netherlands, there was significant opposition against these car-centric cities
I always think that in 50 years people will probably think what the hell people were thinking in the 60's when they thought it was a fantastic, progressive idea to try to funnel as many cars through the city
I was in Copenhagen last December and I loved that street
We never planned to go there but just walking around the city, whenever you got close to it, the amount of people just draws you in
Which is retarded because almost everywhere in cities across the world where cities install bike lanes or even ban cars in a street altogether, retail prices go up as pedestrians and cyclists spend more in local stores than cars
It's almost as if not having to find parking space will increase the chance of people entering a local store

Last time I was there it was better, with very small circulation for cars, I think
And Brussels at the Beurs has gone permantly car-free, which is super nice, I can't remember how it was before because I barely went there before I was 20 or so, but now it's a really nice place
Leuven Grote Markt has been car-free since the beginning of the 90s now, I think or even earlier
I was born in 1991 and never knew any different than completely car-free

>who, wow, don't pay any taxes to use roads at all

>For every kilometre driven by car, the Danish state pays out 16 cents
>Those numbers are from the "Socio-economic analyses of bicycle initiatives - methods and cases", produced by COWI in 2009
[Source]
Just looking at the tax revenue and cost of building roads is extremely shortsighted
Every Euro people spend on driving and sitting in traffic is one they can't spend on improving their life in other ways such as a nicer place to live, more vacation, or even simply better food
Not to mention the fact that cyclists are far healthier on average than drivers, The Netherlands estimates their economic benefit from all the people cycling is [€19 billion a year]
But yeah, bad cyclists, don't even pay taxes
>Please show me an article from a reputable source, not some biker propaganda
Feel free to provide a counter source that accounts for things like driver related injuries/fatalities, healthcare costs due to more sedentary population and economical cost to congestion
Or show me where the "biker propaganda" is wrong
Just dismissing a source because it supposedly is biker propaganda doesn't give me much encouragement to try and find different sources which you may just dismiss without evidence again
>Also, how the fuck does the government coffer 23 cents for every cyclists, if they don't pay any fucking taxes
It's literally explained in the study
Did you dismiss it without even looking at it
>Governments receive more revenue from cars than they spend on cars
Even if you want to ignore the extra healthcare costs heavy car traffic brings due to increased obesity, pollution, and injuries, it's pretty clear cars also bring a significant negative effect in terms of space usage in cities
I've been citing that source for so long, I wasn't aware the link died
Here's a link to the [study]
In case you're interested in the [authors] which I assume you are
>The government still profits immensely from personal car ownership
Really
>We know, for example, that for every kilometre ridden by bike, the Danish coffers recieve 23 cents
>For every kilometre driven by car, the Danish state pays out 16 cents
>Those numbers are from the "Socio-economic analyses of bicycle initiatives - methods and cases", produced by COWI in 2009
[Source]
And Denmark is the country that has a 150% tax just on the purchase price of a car
So if you want to buy a car, you pay 2
5x what it would cost without taxes
>Cars aren't going to be disappearing anything soon, especially for people who don't live in city
Nobody is realistically advocating for
A) That all cars disappear
B) That cars can't be widely used outside of cities where there is ample space to do so
What people do advocate for is that we move away from the "car is king" culture that has dominated most Western cities and countries since the 1960s and that we ensure other, more efficient, road users have sufficient space as well even if that sometimes hinders car users somewhat
People can still drive into Amsterdam
But driving in Amsterdam is not the easiest way to get around so people simply bike
But if you want to drive into Amsterdam, you can still do that if you like
>Around the the same time the UK government collected £38billion in motoring related taxes, total roadworks cost them £3-4billion
Even after taking away other costs you want to lump in here, tax collected from car owners is a serious amount
This revenue made up 7% of the UK's total tax collected in a year
None of this accounts for everything else that comes with cars not to mention the fact that your society as a whole is burning money spending on cars instead of investing in actually useful things
And even if we assume the government makes a lot of money off of it, do you think that a system where people spend a lot of money on something that isn't absolutely necessary if adjustments were made, is sensible policy
It costs a lot to drive
Money UK citizens can't spend on other things
Doesn't that bother you in the slightest
Are you happy spending thousands of pounds a year on driving
>Yes you can, but it comes at severe penalties
Space in cities is limited
Cars take up a lot of space
It makes sense that they don't get that space donated for free
Should we instead aim to be more like the US where everyone drives
Not exactly a society where the middle class is thriving because of all the cars
Driving costs a fuck ton even without taxes
Taxing it ensures that people use different modes of transit which are far cheaper than everyone moving around in a 2 ton block of metal
>It's not fair to punish people for just going from A to B
But it's fair to punish people in the cities for living there by swamping them with cars
Their fault for living there, they should just move
>especially when the government already gets so much tax from motorists already
I've already shown you a study that shows that the Danish government spends more money than it earns on drivers while it earns money from cyclists
You deny that by purely looking at road costs while ignoring for example the economic downsides of congestion which costs our economies significant amounts of money
Healthcare costs, ignored
Driver injuries and fatalities, ignored
If you keep peddling:"the government makes money" from drivers without showing a source that accounts for all factors, I can't take your argument seriously, sorry
> If the public transport is good enough, people will choose it over driving
Do you have a source on that
I don't know a single city that isn't congested and where driving is cheap where people use public transit a lot
> Taxing people to death is just not the right thing to do for encouraging change
Why not
Clearly Denmark and The Netherlands show it works
>The government can profit from both of these and they don't have to compete
I'm sorry, but have you been to historic European cities
Where exactly are you going to make space for both a lot of cars and cyclists/pedestrians
London and Paris have tried to make space for just cars, their traffic is working fine

The issue might very well be the way you count unemployed people
In Portugal, official unemployment is highly regulated, you need to have been working for years prior to your unemployment, and has a deadline (shorter when younger)
Many people finish official unemployment without a job, many that have never had one cannot claim unemployment, and I have a strong suspicion this is what is driving the numbers down
usually, percentage is on a 100 scale
I bet it's just one word in German
would those numbers make any sense otherwise
In Belgium, we take it one step further and invite all 7 (Dutch) parties to television shows, but never the right wing

Well in the current status quo we're warmer then we should be because of the gulf stream

Singapore on the Thames is a fine strategy, if London were a city state

I actually have a lot of respect for May
She must have the hardest job in the world
Trying to find common ground in the uk parliament

>Overall, there were 46,356 people employed across all EU institutions, agencies and bodies
The Good Friday agreement is an agreement between the UK and Ireland that the republic of Ireland will always have open borders with Northern Ireland(UK)
Now because the UK is leaving this means that there needs to be a border to prevent what you described(in both directions, we don't want UK goods, possible(but not realistically) worse quality than EU regulations getting into the EU)
The UK wanted no border between the 2 Irelands but stop freedom of movement between the UK and the EU
EU said "fine, figure it out
" 2 years ago
Now 2 years later they still want the same and want to reopen negotiations
Given the majority of British people want to remain, but the majority of parliament does not
I don't blame the British people, but your line of reasoning does lead to that
It isn't though
Canada and Japan have free trade agreements with the EU for instance, yet there is no customs union or freedom of movement agreement with them
Thanks for more than an "Nu-uh".
Good to know
No idea who came up with what I said in that case
Changing your mind is to be commended
Not condemned
What the public wanted yesterday says little about what the public wants today
The British people want to remain
Coming back on a decision is not making a joke out of the political system
The willingness to come back on a poor decision is essential to a healthy democracy
One could argue the inability to revert decisions would cause not a democracy, but a dictatorship, lead by the leaders from the past
I don't think I've ever met an American that hasn't ever made a joke about wanting some state to leave, but I think if one were to actually contemplate leaving it would be met with insane backlash

Elections are never stood by
That's why we keep having them
Same goes for referenda in countries with a more experience with them
When a second vote is held, to deny the public one of the options, would be making a joke out of democracy
It is no different than systems where only government approved candidates can be put on the list
The British government did do just that though
They held a snap election
It's well within the government's power and responsibility to call for a new referendum when one is desired, just like with elections, especially snap elections

I hate my electric stove
The stove itself has more thermal mass than a fucking boulder
Takes forever to get up to temperature, takes forever to cool down, and the so-called "power adjustment" is just PWM with a 30 second cycle
Meaning you must always think 5 minutes ahead to get the right temperature for cooking something
You'll be making crêpes, everything is fine for 5 of them then the next one comes out all charred because you had set it to 8 instead of 7 ten minutes earlier
Gas meanwhile gets your pan to temperature in just a few seconds, and when you turn it off the pan also cools down immediately
You also have much better visual feedback (seeing the flames vs figuring out through experience that "7" is actually half power)
Yeah I'm not sure it really matters since ovens can be pre-heated
Never used a gas oven, but it probably comes down to installation & running costs (since gas is usually much cheaper than electricity per Joule)

I don't get how you'd become a police officer under such an authoritarian regime tho
it's the police because it's an heritage of the USSR, in theory there should be no need for a police which would be the instrument of the state to oppress the workers so they are supposed to be militia of workers, again that's the theory and I think that you can easily see the limit of it
So basically like in Ukraine where in the end it was only Berkut left ?
To add to that: Tikhanovskaya promised to free the political prisoners and organise elections in six months
So her intent isn't even to be president, but a desperate move for change as you said

Why the hell are they using [PragerU] as a source
edit: Seems like they took that part of the site down
[Archived version here]
> The point is that capitalism is a flexible enough framework that is able to include "socialist" policies
Is it really fair to say the framework is capitalism ? To me it looks like social democracy is the actual framework that makes these countries so successful
It's a bit easy to attribute their success to capitalism when the reason the citizens of these countries have such good quality of life is because of heavy market manipulation, consumer protection and income redistribution
Any economic system has that flexibility
As you said these countries implement socialist policies, so we can also say that socialism has the flexibility to be used within a world where private property is the norm
My point is, as long as you have a healthy democracy and accessible education, you'll probably end up with a mix of capitalist and socialist policies, because both have pros and cons
Pick and choose what you need from both systems, and you'll obtain the best results
Most of the world is dominated by capitalism so you can't reasonably make the assumption that capitalism is the reason we have democracy
You might as well say oxygen is all around us and therefore we have democracy thanks to oxygen (which I guess is kinda true as we wouldn't exist without it but
You get the point)
Correlation does not mean causation
Edit: And there are plenty of capitalist countries with barely functioning governments and huge inequalities
Okay ?
My point still stands
Also, this statement of yours has not aged well :p
> Im not arguing that capitalism is brilliant and flawless
I disagree on number 1

The USA is not a standard to follow or a metric to compare ourselves with
I mean, pretty much every major city had MASSIVE protests up until a week or so ago
That ain't a coincidence
They are mentioning the relationship between protests and covid alright
Just not how you'd expect
[Black Lives Matter protests haven't led to COVID-19 spikes
It may be due to people staying home
[black lives matter protests may have slowed overall spread of coronavirus in Denver and other cities, new study finds]
> But a new study by a nationwide research team that includes a University of Colorado Denver professor has found something surprising: The protests may have slowed the overall spread of the coronavirus in cities with large demonstrations, including Denver
Which is quite the
interesting take
I mean, just do a google search and you'll get the idea
All partisan papers are essentially absolving the protests/riots from spreading covid, while the neutral and most European sources view it critically (except for the guardian obviously)
Covid is not a topic about health in the US, it's all politics
One day it's an existential danger, the next it's no biggie
Just depends on what's politically favorable at the moment
>not even daring to mention the effect that the protests and the massive crowd gatherings may have had to this
I think it had a hidden impact people aren't recognizing
The protests themselves will have spread the disease a little but it's likely quite limited
What isn't limited though it that it completely wrecked the social pressure to take corona serious
It takes a lot to convince people to quarantine and the social blind eye that was turned to the protest probably did a lot of damage to the legitimacy of covid as a threat
The populace seems to have given up much faster in the US (Republic and Democrat states alike) than in Europe
So why didn't it work in California
It is turned into an RvsD issue online but some Democrat states seem to do pretty terrible as well
What could Trump practically do against the dozens of mass large scale protests in every major city though
I can't seem to find the article
but essentially the only protest related covid data we have is from law enforcement involved with the protesters
Increased testing would certainly be desirable
With protests of thousands of people there's likely infected among them
Shouting, chanting and yelling reduces the mask effectiveness
I'm not convinced general hygiene is closely observed
It would be great if the protests/riots didn't increase the spread - enough people died even without corona - though that seems to wishful thinking
At best it didn't cause a massive spread
All true
I was highlighting how the media reports it specifically
As you pointed out, the trump rally was condemned, but thousands of people protesting are not
It's all partisan at this point
Republicans generally don't seem to be much aware of the risks or willing to ignore them across the board
The left and the democrats are quite selective with when they take it seriously

Availability of Google Street view in Europe
I think it's a bummer for Germany and Austria because in the future, it's gonna be really cool to see how streets evolved over the decades using Google Maps
They won't be able to do that
Germany won’t let google on the autobahn
also when google was going to go roll it out you had people getting enthusiastic for the wrong reason, like a police chief saying they would no longer need to patrol as he thought it was a live feed
I read somewhere that Germany and Austria are like this because of some security/privacy law, so sometimes the places also are blurred
meanwhile it took Belgium years of suing and threats to get Google to blur out military bases and I think they still refuse to blur the nucleair power plants
A bunch of Germans on reddit threads like these
Belgium seems to be in between most hate debt exept for a house and a car credit cards ar used but debid cards are stadard as you get one for free with most accounts and every shop that accepts electronic payment accepts them there is now even a debid app for phone payments and exchanging money with people without using cash, most people I know only have credit cards for some foreign eshops (to most accept bakontact now, our debid network) and for hotels and countries where you can't use maestro (standard free on our debid cards and runs on the mastercard network)
Germany has more local speed limits though, I think we drove whatever we wanted to about 1/4 of the time and the other 3/4 was a mix of anywhere between 110-140
N°1 should be the fact that they don't have highways at all
Love me some one-way tunnels with two-way traffic too
> and the farmer gets to set the price
You're saying there's a business case for me moving to Iceland, dress like a farmer, hide next to a motorway, and throw sheep in front of cars
Indeed
Back in 2014 I did a complete tour of the ring road, and it only contained a couple of kilometres of gravel
On these gravel parts, the speed limit is 80 km/h.
I think the proper explanation is that Iceland does not actually have highways of the common type
Even the ring road is 2 lanes (one lane in each direction); the type of road that has a speed limit of 90 or 100 in most of continental Europe
It's the ring *road*. Iceland doesn't have highways
I lived there
It's called the ring *road*, not the ring *highway*. And actually you're right that they do, I forgot about the multiple lane motorways around Reykjavik, so my bad for that
But the ring road is a one lane road with no separation in the middle
[It looks like this] I don't see how you could call that a highway
[Tell me this looks like a highway to you
> There are motorways with multiple separated lanes for each direction in the Reykjavik area
That's true and I stand corrected
I lived there yet somehow I only focused my mind on the ring road here
As for the rest of the ring road being a highway you'd have to admit that's not the type of road people will have in mind when they think of the term "highway" right
And regarding this map it is in my opinon highly relevant to mention that since it is linked with speed limits, it would be mad to have a 140kmh limit on the Icelandic Ring Road because it ressembles a normal road, not what people generally refer to as *highways*.

I feel like Scots right now have the most amount of reasons to be in favor of independence they’ll ever have:

That's like Maryland voting on whether Virginia could secede

Again, even if Wallonia were against it they represent less than 40% of the country, and really

That's like saying the white house is a monument to slavery
Yes, the Antwerp central station was built with his money, but there aren't any overt references to him

Statues however, don't serve any purpose other than to glorify people, which we shouldn't do with Leopold II
That's the difference

There is an "LL" somewhere I think
No, the only reference to Leopold in the entire building is that "II" is carved in a handful of arches
Nothing that a normal person would actually realise refers to Leopold, and they're not even noticeable in the first place
I actually had to google it to find where these initials are
Also I wouldn't mind if we chipped them off either way, there's better symbols than "II" to replace them with

Here in Belgium, lootboxes have been banned for a couple of years now
They fall under the gambling law, as they involve real-life money
The law does state an exception for "physical card and board games" which is how Pokémon cards, Yu Gi Oh cards etc can still be sold
A digital card game cannot use this loophole, because their lootboxes don't contain physical playing cards
[According to this Dutch site that I just googled] the Netherlands have a similar exception in their law
This site says "it's true that card games like Pokémon, Magic the Gathering and Yu Gi Oh do fall under the gambling law, however an exception has been made for card- and board games
This is because when the consumer opens a Pokémon Booster Pack, he always knows that there will be Pokémon trading cards in the package, even if it might not be the ones he was hoping for
" Which is a bit of a weird explanation if you ask me
>"he always knows that there will be Pokémon trading cards in the package, even if it might not be the ones he was hoping for
not correct, it's because in pokemon trading cards there is a key available that says how much percent chance you have to draw X card, these are odds that EA for example does not wish to disclose since that means they can't tweak these odds anymore
It is
Hmm, I kind of hope Belgium doesn't follow that decision
I *loved* Yu Gi Oh cards as a kid
Well I was just quoting the source I linked, but your explanation does make more sense
Maybe that used to be the case
but isn't that where gatcha came from
instead of buying lootboxes you buy keys for a lootbox, which means you always get what you paid for

I knew I wouldn't be original
I'd get depressed as fuck in that kind of climate that never changes
We'll have plenty of too hot winter,springs and summers so give me all the winter I can get
And for experience, I really fucking dislike tropical climates
i feel like we have an 8 month long fall and then go straight to summer nowadays
I'm surprised we even got more than one day of snow this year
I just hope we'll only get one heat wave ...
unlikely hah

All true except for "please think about that some more". I definitely understand that as "bad idea".
I’m a Dutch speaking Belgian, but most of this is obvious
But I think we are culturally closer to the English than the Dutch for some reason
This kind of depends which Dutch speakers you mean
Flemish people would be more inclined towards the Anglophone explanation while for Dutch people this might be more correct
Belgium confirms
Isn't that what everyone understands from those statements
TIL I've always used "correct me if I'm wrong" incorrectly haha
I use it to convey where I'm not really 100% sure of what I'm saying, but it is not like I'm completely unsure
More like, "this is what I currently think, and I'm relatively sure it's right with what I currently know, but if you think that's not completely right, do not hesitate to let me know"
"That's not bad" is also used to convey "that's quite good" in Dutch though, at least in Belgium, so that one kind seems like the odd one out
(and is a very common thing to say)
Out of the rest, I think I'd only interpret "you must come for dinner sometime" somewhat literally
"That's interesting", more notably if followed by a question on to the same topic, I could also interpret literally, depending on the context
The rest is rather obvious
Also, is this list not more typical for UK English rather than the USA
First one is correct for sure, it's very awkward
I'm a Belgian Dutch speaker
And I must say we pretty much use the English way of communication
If we meet, we ask "Hoe is het
" (How are you
), and expect a simple answer like "Goed, en jij
" (Good, and you
Same with the other sentences on how to convince the other person he should rework or reconsider something
This often causes issues when communicating with Dutch Dutch speakers
As I worked quite a bit with Dutch people now, I've also become a more direct, and quite often, I will be bluntly clear what I mean
Certainly in my professional life
I've seen many people, when they are asked to do something they don't like or they don't believe it will work, they will avoid the question and say something like "I will consider that". But never actually come back to it
While I try to communicate in a Dutch style and say "I won't do it for X and Y reason", after which they can try to convince me again
There's a discrepancy between Dutch speakers and Dutchmen
In Flanders we speak Dutch, but we would interpret it more like the Anglophones
I’m not Dutch but my culture is (from my Dad), and my girlfriend too, and yes that’s basically it, especially when we ask « how are you », you imply to take news about how was your situation since the last time we met
Yes
I dont identify with any of this and it all seems quite random
But I guess thats not an exciting answer

They won't make it since the biggest contributor right now the UK (-31% CO2 reduction since 1990) will be leaving the union
So remaining large countries like Germany (-24%), France (-14%), Spain (+14%, yes plus) will have to somehow get to an average of -40% in 15 years , which isn't going to happen
Don't count on my own country like Belgium to contribute anything, even though they will sign every single treaty known to man

> Because we could use our own currency, make our products cheaper (devaluating our currency against the euro), selling more, that would lead to hiring more people in order to be able to produce everything needed, therefore we wouldn't have 25% unemployment rate
Just to name one
You wouldn't have more export to the EU
If you devaluate your currency too much they'll just put import tariffs on the borders with the EU
In the end you'd just make your country poorer
You'd also pay much higher interest rates on your debt compared to today
You'd therefore not be able to take on so much debt to restart and build a solid economy
There is a reason why a lot of countries with weak currencies face bankruptcy even though their debt levels are really low

Belgium and brewery
Should we have expected something else ?
The Affligem Brewery is kind of wrong
Yes monks have been brewing beer for a long time, but can you consider that a business
Not true for Belgium, 1074 is when the Abbey of Afflighem was founded, not the brewery
Some sourpusses reject any sort of change, but I think this is wonderful
More space for people and business without cluttering up the skyline, conservation of historic landmarks, added mobility, looks even greener than before, and I get that the 'pipe' might be divisive, but I'm always a fan of public art
Visited Vilnius 10 years ago, this really make me want to go back there
That's really surprising to hear
Nearly all our cities (Belgium) are built around rivers, I just kind of assumed that was the case for pretty much any historic European settlement
Completely subjective, but I kind of prefer London's mish mash jumble over Paris' "old stays here, new goes there" :) My hometown of Ghent, Belgium, imo does a marvelous job adding ultra modern while respecting existing heritage
Great to hear Vilnius is keeping enough breathing room
Livable urban planning is all too often traded in for more real estate income, which ironically leads to less valuable property smh
Oof, we used to pave over rivers in the 60's and 70's and now we're undoing all of it
La Défense is cool, but because it's so removed from the historic center and it's almost only businesses, it turns into a ghost town after business hours (that's what I remember from a decade ago, it might have changed for the better)
Completely agree on the random highrise
Any architecture that doesn't take its surroundings into account is failed imo
Who knows, by then we might have either holo-rivers, or toxic sludge streams
This is starting to look like 2015 all over again
I'm fearful that Brussels, London and other cities outside of France might be following soon
So I guess Belgium became the Netherlands when we took in all their refugees
You should put the french flag on Corsica, they will hate that ;)
Belgium should be French rather than Dutch, because all those pesky Americans still fucking believe that fries came from France
***TRIGGERED***
Belgium is the Netherlands
We fucking hate them, kicked their asses out off our country and founded our own state
What's wrong with you
How did this stuff even went up
It's not even funny :p.
It would be a compliment in all non-Scandinavian countries
As a Fleming, I welcome the Dutch Annexation
As a Belgian, WTF
You mean Macedonia ? /s
Nah, we built a wall to keep the Dutchies out (we named it ProperDeltaWorks), and then put their flag on it while we taunted them with bitterballs and frikandels, and watched them pedal their bikes aimlessly through the rising water
Spanish guys
I mean, the flag kinda took over all of Spain
You guys are just beneath the water level

Please keep discussion civil and have a nice day
Good to see that post-truth isn't always succesfull
The president can dissolve the government, which Hofer suggested he'd do
It's because that VdB won that it is indeed a symbolic victory
Something wrong
I'm not too familiar with the Austrian papers & such
> Then a new general election would be held, and imagine how THAT would turn out for the FPÖ if they pull that shit
Very positive considering they're leading in the polls
The people who voted for Hofer largely did so because they're not content with the current politics, they want change
Hofer could give them that chance by dissolving the council, and voting out the current government parties
The people who voted for Van der Bellen wouldn't vote FPÖ anyway, so they can't "punish" FPÖ for pulling that trick
Damn
didn't see you embolding it on mobile
I thought that the name was weird but found it in an /r/austria thread about Austrian news sources
I'll take it out
To be fair, Peil overestimates PVV
Meanwhile in Belgium most people only have credit cards for going on holiday and when it comes to card and mobile debid is king
Well this is a complete shit show

You can only vote to one party and give a preferential vote for one candidate in that party
Each party gain an amount of MPs proportional to the national votes and the preferential votes serves to gives the job to candidates that are well loved even if there party wouldn't have chose them initially
We have more or less the same in Belgium except we can vote for multiple candidates in the same party if we want or just vote for the party without caring of the candidates
No sentence for Belgium, well that's annoying
Oh fuck

To add: 'French fries
' for Belgium
For Belgium: "I love Belgian-style beers
That's a thing in America
American beers that are brewed loosely the way Belgian beers are brewed, and are then marketed as "Belgian-style".
Someone once told me that the best Belgian beer is Blue Moon
I was like, that isn't even a Belgian beer you piece of shit
Holy shit
My blood pressure went up just by reading that
And that's even considering that Belgium isn't on the map
I wonder what it'd be for Belgium anyways
Belgium too, for us it would be something like "french fries are invented by the French"
Same feeling my friend, same feeling
Same for Belgium

I don't like wine, but the first time I saw somebody ask for an ice cube in their wine in a movie I was "this is a joke right

No, the real question is : "Is it racist when our culture has no negative  connotation towards *blackface*"

The Beauty of ethnical nationalism
You know, that has absolutely nothing to do with the ABSOLUTE FACT that war was nationalism

Given how divided Belgium is (seperate educational systems and separate media)
I would love to see the numbers for the different regions
So Manuel from Barcelona was right after all
But such a big difference with Portugal
Why
Odd to see Belgium not divided between the communities, I'm sure there are some disparities
What number would be considered "decent" in this index
I've got the feeling that Belgium is speaking English better than the Germans
-A Belgian living in German
Not at all surprised by Spain
I used to work in a big train station and EVERY SINGLE Spanish person that came up to me would just assume that Belgians know Spanish
We don't If you want to talk to me it's either gonna be English, Dutch or broken French
\> assuming we have just two educational systems
[haha cute]
Not gonna lie, probably yeah, still love you guys though
Lol
Oh you silly Walloon
No, the Dutch are definitely better than us in English
But only in terms of grammar and spelling though
Their speech is often horrible
When I hear French people talk English it always reminds me of Gladys from the movie Les Profs
A testament to how well they keep everything renovated too
What effect would this have on the ecosystems of fish and plants
It would kill all trade in Europe
The most important ports are located inside the closed sea
Imagine all that traffic having to go through locks
Build the wall
Drain the sea
If it makes a road from the UK to France (like Neeltje Jans), it is finally connect the UK to the continent, and allow them to feel more european
Too bad they left the EU
Why don't they connect dover to the French caps near Calais
Nothing will flow over those cliffs, and it would protect holland just as well
I see what they're doing ! they're gonna build up water levels in the North Sea to flood Flanders ! the bastards !
Wouldn't this dam become a major problem in armed conflict
Blow the dam and you may wipe out large swathes of territory
Would make us sort of vulnerable no
Compared to just local dams where needed
Hmm
Could we consider tricking the Mexicans into paying for it
Since they're already funding America's walls and all that
and it will cost more than to actually fight climate change
You know the Dutch Ijsselmeer, full of fresh water, used to be a salt water sea, right
OTOH, lowering the water a few meter and building the polder on dry land before raising back the sea level would be awesome

Attributed (but disputed) to Cardinal Richelieu during the reign of Louis XIII of France
you jelly of our place under the sun aye
True, except don't make this personal like you just did
He nor anyone else should bear responsibility for what people 5 generations ago did
chill man, was a lighthearted joke
Dont get your lederhosen in a twist
Can you name 1 interbellum german colony please
Educate me
I also never cut off any hands by the way, but nice try referencing horrors commited in the congo by belgians over half a century ago
&#x200B;
edit: do you even know who and what i referenced with that "place under the sun"? I suggest you google it
Fully agree with you that nobody should be held accountable for what people 5 generations ago did
Not even family members
And imho, not even governments
We and you
Not they and them
You were talking about yourself and him, no one else
If you didn't intend to do that, then you used the wrong words
To my knowledge, all german colonies were lost after WW1, including namibia
That's why i said interbellum, which literaly means "between wars" (i.e. 1918-1939)
But yes, I mostly agree with you that the populace of today has absolutely nothing to do with the horrors of the past and should not be held accountable
But i think i differ with you in that sense that i also think the government should not take responsibility
Because with taking resposibility and admitting guilt, come inevetible monetary claims
Which are eventually paid by the populace of today, which again, i firmly believe should not be punished for crimes commited 5 generations ago
And not to mitigate any wrongdoings, but i also think actions should be judged in the spirit of that time
What i mean with that is that for example slavery was a very normal thing in the 1800s, and nobody thought any ill of it
Today, it is absolutely unthinkable and despicable in the west
Same about having colonies
I DO think that governments should RECOGNIZE and remember the wrongdoings of the past however
And while Congo indeed was a private property of the king, at least when the atrocities were commited, it would be hypocritical to day the belgian people were innocent w.r.t. the barbarism involved
&#x200B;
Finally, the "place in the sun" i reference was uttered by  [Bernhard von Bülow] (indeed during wilhelm's reign) as a "kick-off" to Germany's contemporary colonilization, since it had little (or none even
not sure) at that time, while all other european powers were conquering more and more

Story is actually very popular in Japan
Most Belgians don't even know about it
His only companion was a snake
In all seriousness, I love how the stones form the blanket, absolute work of art
Isn't this from a suske & wiske strip
19th century
In the story he did
He even won a student grant with it to go study at an art academy, but he died before he got to hear the good news
The style of statue caused a bit of a stir when it was revealed
Because, basically a big reason they made this one was to draw Japanese tourists, but apparently many Japanese tourists were rather unimpressed by it, because they expected either a lifelike statue or a statue in the style of the anime
I remember the local new doing a story on it back when
There is actually a statue in Hoboken that draws a lot of Japanese tourists, even though he actually died in the cathedral of Antwerp
Especially popular in the US and Japan, but that's it indeed
In the 80s Belgian/Antwerp tourist offices jumped on it
And it's one of the most convenient things we don't appreciate enough

* cheaper air travel ain't a good thing ... it's cool you can do those city trips at a drop of a hat but they come with a huge carbon footprint attached to them
* single market competition hasn't brought nothing but decay of railways, disinvestment in nuclear power and left us with no GAFAs ... it sank our nokia, siemens, Erickson, Thomson, Alcatel, ... we pay more for our electricity and water while having to buy american, chinese, or Korean appliances, computers, and smartphones
* enhanced social welfare such as what ? Posted Workers ? delayed retirement age ?
* 48 hours without overtime ? What a joke
The median worked hours across Europe are in the vicinity of 28 hours ... 40 hours only if you consider  the full time employment
* the EU let deliberately more people drown in the Mediterranean sea than Trump and all his predecessors let people drown or die while trying to cross the Rio Grande or the deadly Arizona desert
*  the number of flights increased
This is not a good thing regarding our climate issues no matter how you spin it
* seriously
The EU so called free and fair competition principles destroyed our high tech champions while other countries protected and developed their own
It took the same time to the Chinese and Russians to develop their own GAFA it took to us to destroy ours
The f&f competition promised to lower our bills, they raised
It's a failed policy that made of our continent a tech desert
* Delayed retirement age is a political choice not a law of nature
Most people retire a decade earlier, either because they can't find a job in their 50s or they are washed out
Delayed retirement age translates not in people working longer but in poorer pensioners
* bragging about something that leaves most behind is ridiculous
Overtime should be banned with a few exceptions
A 30 hours work week would solve most of our employment issues

Other people doing it is a weird flex, it's still a huge step backward not forward
It's not the single or unified market that's preventing Europeans to develop their own tech giants
It's the rule of free and uncompromised competition laws that prevent us to state fund our tech companies and turn them into global giants
We had hundreds of tech companies in the turn of the millenium
Multuple competitors to Amazon, google, and the like
An Airbus, an Ariane wouldn't be possible in todays Europe
China, while having the GDP of Germany, banned the american companies and developed its own
Russia, while having the GDP of Spain, developped its own (not sure if you can have google, twitter and facebook in Russia ... probably but they have their own)
Life expectancy is declining in the UK and the US ... Mostly because of drug abuse and economic issues
GDP has been multiplied by four for the same period
We're rich enough to not die at work
what impact ? France were better off when they worked 35 hours, employment boomed then
5 % is surprisingly high
[So I checked ...] It's doesn't include unemployed people, pre-pensioners, people in between jobs, self employed, people who dropped out of statistics and it doesn't reflect EU disparity rates
Part time employment rates:
Netherlands 46
8% Austria 27
6 Germany 26
8 Bulgaria 1
8 ... What does that even mean ? How can those numbers be so different
It shows that the EU modified its rescue policy to let knowingly thousands die at sea
sure they issued a fine and the only thing that changed is you will get a browser choice popup, way to stick to google bois
and manufacturers have to pay to have the privilege of using Chrome, surely that will change everything
a fine doesn't break up a monopoly it's the cost of doing business
>The move will draw inevitable comparison to Microsoft’s “browser ballot” web page that it showed to Internet Explorer users in 2010 to comply with a similar European Commission ruling

Yeah, and if you've ever seen some HD imagery of those bridges, you'll find that they are very crude recreations, if you can call them that at all
The bright colours and miniature size make them more of a joke than an actual recreation
I mean, just look at them
Then the commander laughed, thinking about the diaries of his grandfather’s brother Hermann
Modern reactive armor solves the problem of ATGM's almost entirely to the point that a well placed shot from the tank cannon is more likely to score a kill
But newer types of reactive armor can even stop that
Stay strong Austria
As Europeans we are all together in this
5 arrested, 1 attacker dead
Unsure whether more are on the loose
Quite distasteful to call the shows of solidarity and compassion "trash". Have you got no empathy whatsoever
I haven't heard anything official in that regard
Just the speculations in comments etc
I'm not sure when or even if that information gets released
This is great news, particularly the adoption part; too many kids not having parents, and couples wishing they could have kids
I really can't stand the idea of kids being raised "by the system" instead of in a loving family (whatever the composition)
Well done Finland, well done
Well, we don't know 100% for sure but a leading theory that we are quite sure about is that in nature people were born gay to serve as "guard dogs" to stay up at night protecting other people since they didn't have the standard I go hunt and then come home to my woman mentality
In modern times this isn't needed ofcourse but ym point is that people are born gay, and the ratio of gay to straight people is very much in favour of straight people
Don't worry about the planet turning gay since you don't just turn gay and more people are born straight than gay
In terms of reproduction, adoption is the obvious one
It's hard and can be expensive so that sucks and I hope that changes in the future (the money part not the hard part) and lets say for some reason everyone becomes a flaming homosexual then people would still have sex they just wouldnt enjoy it as much or at all
Anyway people shouldn't see being gay as this whole new way of living and some mystical creature
Same person, but they just have a different type
why are you speaking elvish
No I'm pretty sure Elves were first

It's not like those will ever be used, remember there has only ever been one successful emergency landing on water
Walloon politicians listen to France so many times, why don't they do it now
Nice to see one of our neighbours has some sense
I'm pretty sure this has fuck all to do with France thinking nuclear is the way forward but with ENGIE (former Gas de France - Suez) pushing this so they can get their hands on even more countries' power supply
Same in Belgium
> First of all Nuclear is not renewable
It involves mining for uranium
Which there is no shortage of for a long time, especially irrelevant considering the critical moment is right now and not what to do in 500 years
>Currently the US is storing 90000 tonnes of Nuclear waste
I'm actually amazed it is that little
Imagine how much more co2 a zero-nuclear USA would have dumped into the atmosphere if we were actually worried about that neglible amount
That's roughly 50000 average weight US cars
>Finally if it goes wrong its catastrophic
Climate change going wrong however isn't an "if". Let's deal with that first before worrying about triple lottery winnings
Seriously, what matters is how much people will *likely* die because of something
We don't refuse to build dams because something could go wrong and we realize demonizing hydro energy over it is counter productive
We don't refuse to build solar because some people will die during maintenance/construction/placement (solar performs worse than nuclear when measuring deaths/kwh)
Especially shutting down functioning already built reactors because of political pressure is downright stupid
I don't know
It looks like the WiFi would suck
They may define themselves as irreligious in Belgium, but the majority has still been baptized and done their communion “for the presents”.
Hard to belive the Hungary numbers, considering they vote for a party dedicated to "preverve Christian values and defend a Christian Europe".
as much as I applaud  this, I really need to know the sample size of a chart that says the UK (and several others) have 0% non-christian religion
(also, Belgian here, thinking we got plenty more than 60% atheists among 16-29 year olds) ...smells fishy
I don't think it's just Christianity, it's religion in general
Stop drinking that American juice that just boils down politics to simply left vs right, Europe's political landscape is far too diverse for that
Here you'll have left vs left, right vs right, left vs right, center left/right vs left and right

The title is reaaaaaally misleading, thanks for adding this
Hyperlinks do not count regarding article 13, since the law explicitly says users must upload the content
Hyperlinks do not count regarding article 11 because it explicitly says it does not concern itself with hyperlinks and shall not have any effects on them
That addition to the law was useless anyway
Article 11 concerns itself with copies or summaries of press articles
Not even with quotations within a wider context
As such, the conclusion this applied to hyperlinks was absurd anyway

Belgian crisis finally solved, thanks OP
Came here to coment the same thing
Porra
Just to add to your comment 'Porra' is is more like damn and 'foda-se' is fuck
Das kut hé?
Lmfao at "kut" though
Who do they think we are Dutch
I think it was the Dutch doing their colonisation thing again,  because no Flemish person says "kut"
I wouldn’t mind this as long as we get coffee shops
It sure was if you're French
Now give us back Frans-Vlaanderen
While 'foda-se' can also be used with that meaning, in terms of semantics the translation in the comment above is more accurate, but tbh they are kind of interchangeable depending on the on the situation and the feeling you want to convey
Calm down there EU-Florida
Let's fuse the Belgisch Koninkrijk and Koninkrijk der Nederlanden into the Belgisch Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, or the BKN
And while we're at it, let's annex France into the BKN as well and rename it Groot-Wallonië!
But wait, will we have to replace our godverdommes with alsjemenous
Exactly
We get coffee shops and they get us
Your comment unintentionally, or unknowingly, highlights the cause of most of Belgium's problems, as well as a large chunk of its history
Yes
And also, Walloon was much closer to Flemish than to French
In an alternate universe where Belgium formed but with no French occupations before it, we would've likely had just one language

Please rescue me from Belgium we are burning at school, with facemask I want to move to norway
This is fine
This is why I'm a bit triggered when anyone say that they're happy that the winter is milder and that spring is summer-like yeah enjoy the fucking actual summer
Purple means death
Yeah no, it used to be below 20°C the average on july and august for my region
Now we're waaaaaaaay over 20°C as average
Crazy how u can say it's "tame" when it's breaking all the temperature records that were established during last summer year
Very tame summer indeed

just wait till we all start posting "winter in country X" pictures
Many countries refer to those as Middle-Eastern rather than Asian
And yet, in many countries people who see the word Asian will think of the Far East rather than the near East

In fact, Saint Nicolas, commonly called Sinterklaas, is the basis for the character of Santa Claus
I know, but actually the Bulgarian monarchy wanted to take Belgium as a model

if America succeeds be sure Europe will follow, it's in our best interest to support america on this
Also the majority of the  most common websites are from the USA so we will feel this
That's why EU makes 'Directives', so every country has some flexibility regarding their own laws
(I did a big shortcut, as I'm no expert in EU laws, regulations and directives)
From Wikipedia:
> Directives normally leave member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted
EDIT: as pointed out, NN is a regulation, not a directive, anyway, my statement stays true for a lot of EU actions
in theory yes, but big ISP's have proven time and time that they're going for malpractices
So regulations to keep them in check would be for the best
It wouldn't have lasted long once the markt was really open and roaming was a thing of the past
You think so
there's already a political party looking into repealing net neutrality in belgium
If it passes in America this goes on the fast lane in Belgium
there is already a political party in belgium that is looking to put this on the agenda, if countries start to look into this, and the US implements this it's only a matter of when the EU follows
While not being that obvious like the US big money is also involved in the EU

We're civilized people and will always follow the rules of war

Since 1 block is 1 meter tall and the scale is 1:230, one side translates to 230 meters from this minecraft world to real life
230^2 = 52900

In addition to that, will I have to get licenses for each screenshot I have used in my past articles

Here are the people who voted for the articles in Belgium
Every national sub should do the same
You can find the MEPs info here  and how they voted here

Also, don't forget to thank another MEP for the support
Most of Conservative and Labour voted in favour though
Big chance that the British government would do the same
Is this law under QMV (probably) in the Council
You could I guess see if there is a large enough coalition of Member States who could block or change it
It's directive, which means every government can implement it at their leisure, which they probably all will because the vote was a landslide
&#x200B;
So unless article 50 makes you personally immune from your own national government as well, it won't do a goddam thing
Lobbying in the EU doesn't quite work like in the US
Since campaigns are financed with public money there isn't really a bribe culture
It mostly has to do with access
Corporate lobbyists are privately funded and have more money and thus more resources to convince decision makers, while public lobbying groups have less resources and thus have a harder time competing with the private industry
RemindMe
6 hours
RemindMe
cause it's just copyright law and it's not even the final vote
And then again it's just a directive, which means every country will have to implement it themselves anyway, it's just a guideline
TL;DR: LibDems, Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and UKIP against, most of Tories and Labour in favour
And if the websites implement it globally, that'll be an excellent push for decentralized networks
As a Belgian, I'll just assume we don't murder anymore
This is the reason why we don't make good police series
Bruh
Had to look up what the Brabant Murders were
It's not known here under that name
Here it's "De bende van Nijvel" (The gang of Nijvel)
In my, an many people's opinion: extreme right branch of our federal police that wanted a police state/extreme right government and extended policing power
Or maybe really just worlds worst gangsters
Weird case, still very much talked about here
Hope to one day find out what happened and who was behind it
Pedophile scandals, I guess you mean Dutroux and his gang
Terrible case, but one that's probably a little too well liked by international conspiracy theorists
The asshole is still in prison, yelling about "all he knows" (new video came out of him last month,, making those claims)
They've given him the chance to talk several times
He never has anything to offer
I'll believe him if he says something tangible
Well maybe he shouldn't have been so honest with covid-19 deaths then
^/s
That's rich from somebody who butchers that language even more than we do
How about you stop using "heb" and "dat" as one size fits all words
It's "tueurs du Brabant" in French (so Brabant's murderers)
It wasn't the federal police as they didn't exist yet it was our gendarmes (rijkswacht) probably
As a result off all these failings thy abolished all our existing law enforcement and created what we have now local and federal
The father of someone I know was the head officer in the research of the Bende van Nijvel case
One day when he was completely sober and not tired he had a fatal car crash and the person I know thinks that de Bende van Nijvel killed his father because he came dangerously close with the research
He was the first person to suspect that they were officers
Hanlon's razor
"Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity"
Don't underestimate what rank and shortsightedness in police and so can manage to fuck up
Just finished ["White House Farm"] yesterday
Same thing there
Head investigator was so sure of the wrong suspect he wouldn't even consider anything else
>DCI Thomas "Taff" Jones, deputy head of CID, was so sure Sheila had killed her family that he ordered Bamber's cousins out of his office when they asked him to consider whether Bamber had set the whole thing up
I knew they didn't use Nijvel, but I thought it was another city, not the region
I know our current federal police didn't exist, but had a brainfart on how to best describe our rijkswacht: gendarmery, carabinieri, militarised national police, state cops with mandatory moustaches
Military branch that does police grunt work (so no investigative stuff) that wasn't part of the military anymore
Also "swans"
Ah yes when our motorcycles cops had harleys and trench coats
Do you guys also have an "official" colaboratory body
This one is the best name so far

I don’t think you know much about Belgium if you think it’s just Bruges/Antwerp/Ghent that’s worthwhile and has less to see than Riga alone
The answer is yes
There's many beautiful spots in Luxemburg
Source, my brother lives there and we've gone around
There's "la petite Suisse"
Wallonia has like a million castles and cool nature things to see
Idk where you’ve been
Brussels can be a letdown sure, it’s not for everyone
I think Brussels is more fun to live in than to visit as a tourist, that’s when you really appreciate it for what it is
Or so I e heard at least, all my friends who move there love it and that’s what I get from random people I’ve met there too
But Bruges and Ghent are more impressive than Riga imo in terms of the beauty of the cities
I do think Riga is more “fun” though if that makes sense, there’s more things to do and good parties
But obviously if you want parties in Belgium you just wait for Tomorrowland
I learned with the Belgian Francs my first year of primary school and we switched to Euros in my second year and had no difficulty at all adjusting
Old people often complain how expensive something is saying it's x amount of Francs which will sound like a high number because you have to multiply the Euro price by about 40 times but people my age are really happy with the Euro considering travelling before the Euro was introduced was really annoying with having to exchange money and all that and there being no real disadvantages

Don't be dense, that's my entire point
Roma and Romanian sound very similar but have little in common except for a rather significant geographical overlap
(Technically you could argue that Romania does the same with the Roman Empire and Belgium with the Celto-Germanic Belgae, but those are entirely different discussions and the old entities don't exist anymore today
Of course not, I didn't say that

that's so far from the truth it's laughable

Super anecdotal data from Belgium: there were 18 people in my primary class
I can say that in Belgium my class sizes have been between 12(exceptional) and 18(about what we expected)
Belgium:
Primary schools usually 23-25
Secondary schools range from 15-25 on average depending on what you are studying
We have a class with 3 people in my year
Higher educations: no sources
Belgium has no primary education
We start in high school
Belgium 25-20
I was in a class with 12 people for 6 years
It was heaven

Some people outside of the city of Rome make mocking variations on SPQR
For example, the Lega Nord right wing politician Umberto Bossi once used the much more biting ["Sono Porci Questi Romani"]
Stats should not be misinterpreted
This is not a graph showing the average happiness of citizens
I will link such a graph from google images (you can look for the source there)
Compare the graphs and notice that the whole of southern Europe is actually *unhappier* but they just don't kill themselves that easily
Now in my country the suicide rate is higher than anywhere in Western Europe but the happiness rate is among the best together with Netherlands and UK
Nobody going to talked about Belgium
Their men and women suicides are one of the highest in the world
... And why use double color gradients
The data is interesting, but this is not a good way to visualize it
There's plenty of highly upvoted comments about this, though
hardly "no one". But if you want to push a narrative, feel free
Exactly
As it stands, the visualisation leads the reader to think that the green coded countries on the men’s side are winners on some kind of morbid race
For the most part they are trying to keep the wheels in motion until the day there's a different president and they can when together again
The idea anyone is anyone else's bitch for trying to acquire or maintain international cooperation despite refusal of an idiot is very short sighted
Except that 'the child' commands more economic & military power than all the other people in the picture combined

My job adresse only got a few of those emails while my private was flooded by company i didn't even know had my details

No, I did get a notification to accept their new terms when I opened the app yesterday

Even IMF Bailout chief Ashoka Mody agrees it was a nasty mishandled episode:
I tell every EU official I meet in Brussels the debt should be shaved down further, and that the whole operation stinks
They mostly agree, but that's probably because I only meet lower level EU staff
Doing my small part
When I started reading the title I first thought she had died

The Dutch language is from both our countries
No, cause Portuguese was imported in Brazil while Dutch is native to (parts of) Belgium
Yup
I still resent the southern accent I picked up from watching Dukes of Hazards as a kid

A big part of what this chart includes as "beer" is actually cat piss
We’re talking about beer here
Heineken is a soft drink ;)
My fellow countrymen need to step it up
That’s the case in most countries anyway
The power of marketing, combined with the fact that a lot of beer is consumed for the purpose of getting drunk regardless of taste
No, I don't think I will

Does the Icelandic cod wars really count as wars though
Switzerland is counted as zero but participated in WWII, helping Hitler to find Jewish

obviously more potatoes, but still

Leisure castles are castles which, despite their style, have no defensive function
However, the Château de Pierrefonds is really a medieval fortified castle, it was indeed rebuilt by Violet le Duc in the 19th century
you'll be amazed but we do; and not only with apples
What the fuck is this news site
There’s no report of this in our news
Which is odd, considering they’d jump on the opportunity to lament the fate of minorities
Why do they talk about nazi concentration camps
What has that got to do with anything
EDIT it’s now on national news
I haven't seen this on any BE news site yet
VRT has it, but there isn't any more info then in the OP
If this is football related, that's very unfortunate timing
Recently the Jewish community, on their own, without the Catholic Church or any imams , fought the ban on religious ceremonies at the highest court, and won
(The argument made in the media was that for Jewish religious ceremonies, at least 10 men have to be present, which was not allowed
Weddings here are atm max 5 including the pair
So the Jewish community has been in the media attention
I can imagine many people being quite angry (eventhough the Jewsih community did nothing wrong)
But during a deadly pandemic trying to change the emergency measures instead of adapting your own seemingly arbitrary customs is not a great look
So I was kinda expecting some antisemitism, but this is really bold
It's a nice fantasy to have, I agree
Cancer is a common swearword in the Netherlands which is close by there, I doubt they gave it that much thought
It’s the cancer part, not the Jews part
Yes, Belgians don't use cancer as a swearword
Only hear it in the Netherlands
modern antisemitism in western europe is mostly due to the israel-palestine conflict
It’s just a strange article
I’m not saying it didn’t happen
It’s actually very likely some teenagers think this is somehow funny
I just don’t see why Israelis are reporting on it and then the whole part about the Nazi detention camps
Just bugs me because we actually have one of the larger Jewish communities here in Antwerp and they’ve been living quite peacefully with the local Muslims
Makes Antwerp look bad for no particular reason
We Belgians are sophisticated people who prefer genitalia-based insults over disease-based ones
You can do the experiment yourself

That's funny because I believe Chinanis one of the few countries with more wealth disparity than the USA
No he's not sabotaging anything
For decades, the right in the US has labeled anything from universal healthcare to a slightly higher gas tax as "socialist".
Healthcare provided by the government
Socialist
Taxes on the wealthy
Socialist
Environmental regulations
Socialist
Socialism just became a buzzword for right-wing media to demonize any left-wing policy
So Bernie, instead of consistently rebuking the claims that his policies are socialist, is going:"if that's socialism, then I'm a socialist, **so what**?"
You have to understand, playing defense in politics is a bad thing
Your opponent can just throw a quick one-liner at you which probably would take you a significant amount of time to explain why it's wrong what he's saying
Instead, you can just roll with it and turn the question on them:"if socialism is affordable healthcare for every citizen, what's so bad about that
". Now suddenly the right has to explain
Sure, the propaganda still runs deep for a lot of US citizens who fear the word socialism, but a lot of young people are going:"if what they have in Denmark is socialism, then I guess I'm a socialist". The label is losing it's effect when it comes to demonizing common sense policies
What if you don't like living over there
For let's say healthcare, education prices or gdpr
Ah definitely, I totally understand
I was was just projecting myself in your situation and asking myself what I would do
The US doesn't look like a country where I'd want to live but like you said, if the relationship is worth it
I find online privacy important, so yeah I included it in my reasoning why I'd rather live in Europe
I put it last because healthcare and education are more important

I wish the Daily Mail would burn to the ground
They never told us who won legs-it
While not perfectly neutral by any means news in Flanders at least tends to be professional imo
Most newspapers, the actual news during the evening, etc
I mean ffs, even HLN in print isn't that awful imo
Their website though is obviously a disaster yes
I dunno, HLN is pretty close to this kind of shit
Such a trash paper
Is 't Pallieterke being printed, or just online ?
Indeed, HLN is a quality newspaper compared to the Mail
is it though
britian is in a horrible negotiating position
who's going to sign off on whatever crap deal they can muster
Even HLN profiles itself as a more chill, non-serious vacation newspaper
I really love Flemish newspapers (De Standaard/Tijd) for their professionalism and general aim for objectivity
They're hinting, but never as flagrant as the Daily Mail
The amount of blatant false news I've found on their site is hilarious
Ow no, it changed a lot over the years
I can only speak for the online version as I don't buy physical papers but the website just became more and more as you perfectly described, tabloidy
Also a huge difference between the printed version and online articles
Irrespective of any potential grudge, whatever deal the UK will get will be worse than the one they had since that one was easily the best one in the EU
The preferential treatment will fall away at the very least, so it will already be worse categorically
well, yes, the whole thing is obsiously pretty fucking sad
no deal is bad
a bad deal is bad
it's all fucking bad
there
that wasn't so hard to formulate
What newspaper did he pick up instead
DS too left
I mean, really
Also information was leaked which they didn’t know about
The Wehrmacht was actually just waiting for the allies at the specific location that was leaked
There are even images of the Germans shooting them out of them out of the sky with infantry and artillery
So you're gonna leave out like, more then half of my country
And like not include Spain at all

Wait Wait Wait, I thought it was the UK that caused, let me count, all Brexit problems and not the EU
I wonder who that spokeswoman is talking about an anti-democratic backstop when the pm hasn't even be elected and they refuse systematically to hold a second referendum
Yeah, the parties supporting the Irish backstop made up the majority of the electorate in Northern Ireland
But no one asks Northern Ireland what they want

Here in Belgium we pay at least 35€ to get as much download and upload can be between 40Mbps Max to 7Mbps Max depending on the ISP
Absurd
Cries in Dutch with a different accent with twice the price for the same speed
If you're on Proximus, EDPNet will gladly provide the exact same connection on Proximus infrastructure for 35€ with a free landline thrown in cuz it's there anyway
Another thing we can thank Europe for
Most people here in Belgium have a separate bowl for it or something
Not much different from a fruit bowl
As you said, culture really
When I think of Germany I think of power and quality
Good thing the west has never sent in covert troups to any conflict
This sub constantly shits on Russia for things we also do, and then gets angry when that gets pointed out
Here is a novel idea, both sides of this powerstruggle are shit
This Russia bashing only serves to make our side seem like some enlightened utopia, when in reality its just as horrible, just a bit more hidden
On both sides the media only reports on bad things the others do
No, bad actions should be criticised
no matter who does it
The problem is that they are often criticised without involving the broader picture
The Ukrainian situation is far more complex than "hurr durr Russia invaded secretly just cuz they are evil".
*that* narrative just serves to shift the focus away from home

Point me to a pro Russia comment I have made
The USA,  was openly thinking about overthrowing the elected government of venuzeula, after meddling in their trade for years
But sure, we're not doing anything bad, or being violent against peaceful protestors in hambach trying to save some nature, we are the democratic pure free west after all
It is always the 'others' that are evil
Click the links, it's total bullshit
But whatever, comments about Cuba and the USSR are somehow pro Russian federation
With 'we' I assumed you meant the west/nato
The EU does support the US' imperialist agenda,  logistically and militarily
And we certainly do a lot of our own meddling

I thought Sint Pietersberg in maastricht was the tallest mountain in the Netherlands
They got too high to climb it
Hush
Let them have this moment
Yeah before we crush them with our mighty [Signal de Botrange] at 694 m
Looks like a somewhat false Wikipedia fact
[link]
If you go to the "three land point" in Maastricht you see the mountain going higher up across the border
It sure is the highest point in the Netherlands, but the higest peak of that mountain is in Belgium
The Netherlands can have it dho
We  even ski on our "mountains"...somewhat farther south
Excuse me the staircase makes it 700 m thank you very much

Breakfast sad
It's not good is it
The EU, almost since its beginning, has been neoliberal
So, yes, it's aligned to parties on the right
One of possible good outcomes of the UK leaving is that Tories (or Blair like Labour) won't have the excuse of "we implement austerity because of EU rules", they'll have to own it
The EU has historically pushed very hard for deregulations and privatisation
That is up to British citizens
Once the Tories go on full welfare state nuking mode they can be put out of office and there won't be the usual EU excuse
They don't look that different

According to the Estonian above you in this thread it’s pronounced like our word for onion: ui
Helpful comment
Indeed, we’d have to be sure the Estonian speaks perfect French to know how he pronounces “soeur”. If you’re right about ö (and I think you are) someone may have to tell him his French pronunciation is not up to speed
(x) Doubt
At least germany isn't using nuclear am I right
looks like she just farted and they are both like ... hmmmm what now
Well, even if it gets through the committee it still needs to be voted by the Parliament
Depends on the issue
Depends on the people
But yes, we still have it pretty good
Except for zero rating, we have net neutrality in Europe
No one is allowed to block or even slow down a particular service
As I said, zero rating is allowed, which is indeed one big compromise in the NN regulation, but they're not allowed to slow down (let alone block) any other service in order to achieve higher speeds for the zero-rated service
I looked up the Vodafone gigapass and from what I read (in my shaky German) it's just another zero rating example
I can't find articles where they say they speed up select partners
Interpol is merely a 'notification system', which enables you to 'signal' a suspect for example, and which can then be arrested by foreign police authorities
The extradition itself depends on whether or not there are extradition treaties in place between the country where the suspect was apprehended and the country that 'flagged' the suspect
It took me some time to realize that's not a notch or something in that speedo

For anyone interested, the Belgian guy, Paul-Henri Spaak, ended up with quite the interesting international cv after this as well
* Chaired the first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations (General Assembly President)
* First President of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe
* First President of the European Coal and Steel Community (start of the EU)
* Second Secretary-General of NATO
He was also very influential in the treaty of Rome which led to the common market and the EU

and we're still having 7 governments in belgium (or 6, idk, idc, way to many)
Very nice
Eyyyy vlaams
1 federal, 3 communities, 3 regions should equate to 7, but since the Flemish parliament/government govern both the region and community it's *just* 6 parls/govs

Herfst, voile keeskop
Weird how belgium is so low swhen we have 3 official languages in Belgium and most younger people can speak english if not broken english
Unless i suppose its because we have 3 official languages, so the amount of foreign languages is less ? Like if your native dutch and have learned french its  not considered a foreign language because its one of the official ones ?
Lol Spain my arse
This statistic isn’t totally fair for Belgium because we have 3 official languages
Belgium at 77%, I wonder it has to do with the phrasing bc we have 3 official languages, meaning you could be trilingual with knowing a 'foreign' language technically
Well isn't it a subjective thing, some people say they can read another language, even though they can literally translate 5 words
Goddamned Wallonia dragging us down again
Belgium has a Dutch speaking part with French as second language, and a French speaking part with Dutch as second language
(German is the 3rd official language, English is very common too, as is Spanish)
But but efficiency
Why not make the river go over the canal

Ah, I am told that this joke can only be made about Belgian canal bridges
So technically, all ships and boats passing under there are submarines
It's insane how many people have commented retarded suggestions so as to not use an aqueduct as if water is a solid matter without its own set of rules
Yes
I don't think I have ever heard anyone refer to it as anything else but the Forum Romanum
Hearing it being called "roman forum", even though it is a literal translation, somehow seems to make it seem like something lesser

Most of the buildings are new but they have an ancient look on the outside

I would love to get your opinion on how the museum has changed
I remember visiting it in the beginning and again last year and to me, it has not improved
It is still a must for everyone interested, but in my humble opinion, it is just a normal museum nowadays, showcasing relics, basically, whereas in the beginning the museum managed to make you "feel" the horror that the war was
Thank you for sharing
You are definitely not wrong, but I hadn't looked at this from the kids point of view
If you catch my drift ;)
How can the executive branch lead a coup
Isn't a coup a forceful attack on said branch
Ah yes
Then the EU is undemocratic
>It’s like a grounding in the reality on both sides of the channel
The EU has always been pretty clear about what Brexit would mean, we're just waiting for the UK to get the message
Looks cool
Me and my mates turned 18 last years so we entered the competition to win free interrail passes and we won

The massive scale in which Leopold II killed congolese people
People always think the only casualties that fell where on the plantations but the local police force also killed random people for no reason
Because he also build up the countries infrastructure people think its ok for his statues to still stand
I've talked to people from Brittany who told me stories their (great) grand-parents told them
They were forbidden from speaking Breton, not just at school, but also in the streets in general
So a lot of them didn't bother teaching the language to their children
I'm assuming the same was happening with other languages
His statues remain because he is part of our country's history
Isn't it ironic that we have talked more about his misdeeds because of these statues , more than any year before ? Proving that they're serving their purpose; talking about history instead of burrying it
What you did to Greenlanders, and to a lesser extent Icelanders, during your colonial time is worse though, and unjustified
While resentment and rage against Germans was understandable after WW2
Don't we give statues to people we want to honor
We shouldnt forget what happened in Congo and i dont think statues are the best way of that
Imo the statues belong in a museum, but I don't really care
I've never seen any of his statues anyway
No they just fall from a window
That's not mysterious, everyone can have such accidents
Leopold II isn't just any mass-murderer
He did a lot for the country through bad actions
Making him an important part of our history
The dude is omnipresent in Brussels architectur
And I'm not defending his deeds here, just letting you know how uneducated your argument is
Actually, a statue of his in Ostend was vandalised by chopping off a hand of one of the African figures as a sign of protest, and it has remained that way ever since
The city is not planning on restoring it as they do want to show the misdeeds that happened during the colonial period
They also stated that they don't want to "hide it" in a museum, but instead leave it where it is with a critical text on colonialism in multiple languages so that it is visible for everyone to see
>I'm done pretending it isn't stupid to act like the statues are important
If statues are not imporant, why bother to remove them ?
&#x200B;
>Hitler built large parts of the Autobahn in Germany
Should we keep statues of him hanging about in parks
I honestly don't see the problem with Germany having Hitler statues either
Again, to me a statue is a history artifact
Nobody asks you to put flowers at its feet
I don't see how it's an honor for Hitler to have his statue remaining if most of what we remember of him are his atrocious policies and the war he caused, and that those things are acknowledged
It's really about not hiding the past
And again that's exactly what's great about the Leopold II statues , people talked about it
Should Rome remove all the statues from Roman emperors ? Should France destroy every public mention of Napoleon ?
The Netherlands, it's just a matter if time until it happens
Goodbye France
Never really liked you
Definitely France . We would finally be rid of their ego and sail directly to Italy
And also, Germany would have no reason to invade us anymore

You need to suffer from a terminal (physical or psychological) condition
The problem is that it's not always clear where the line for "suffering" and "terminal" is, especially with psychological conditions

In Belgium euthanasia is applied by a physician
At this point I (still) believe that Johnson will be the loudest (and fastest) route to a complete standstill and new general elections
In the context of Brexit it highers the chances of a no-deal (because that's still the default outcome) if things won't find a faster gear
He has the advantage that he at least has a plan, which could probably be best described as making a lot of noise and creating chaos
He's gonna blame all his failures of Brexit on The EU itself
For the rest, what he does in his own country is of no concern for me
I'd rather just see him and the UK pack their shit and leave the fucking EU already
I'm sick of hearing about this in the news and this shit dragging on and on
&#x200B;
The British voted for the Tories, now deal with the fat cunt it brings forth
Good luck to all
It'll be a bumpy ride
Are you dumb
> their attempt to put the wishes of ~~IRA~~ the Republic of Ireland
Fixed it for you
EU stands with RoI and its demand of a legally binding backstop
If the EU would throw RoI under the bus, every other small member state of the EU will see that if push comes to shove the EU ignores the wish of the smaller state when negotiating with a large external country
D'office not a plan
The big difference with May is that Johnson is powerful in London but unreliable for Brussels, where May didn't have much power in London but was reliable Brussels
Every single Brexit scenario looks absurd at this point, and in every single scenario there will be a power struggle
With government, parliament, tory party, labour party and EU as possible parts of that power struggle
At this point I'm afraid that both the conservative party and parliament are in the weakest position
> pushing the agenda of ~~a terrorist organisation~~ the Good Friday Agreement
Fixed it for you, again
If I was French, I would've said the Louisianna purchase
But in our case, probably the fact that we thought Hitler would respect our neutrality
When we decided forming a country out of 3 national identities was a good idea
That time we had no government for a year
Belgium actually had to remain "perpetually neutral" , as declared in the Treaty of London
It was one of the conditions for Belgium to be recognized as an independent country by the European powers
Yeah, otherwise we'd still be the southern Netherlands
Money isn't really a concern for me but I'm rather cheap and really want to live of €100/month for food once(my meal money I get from my job so I would be eating for "free")
Should check out how I would do that
Atm it's closer to €300
Could save some without really losing any comfort so why not
That's actually a brilliant idea to look at
I'm certainly going to do that
I have aspergers so I have 0 issues eating basically the same thing for a week
If I could find something cheap, that I can make quickly in big quantities and just put in the freezer for an entire week I'm so doing that

Come to think about it I consider Dutch my first language because it was my schooling language
But I've always had to switch so much between English, Dutch, now French and before Urdu, and then local Limburg dialects for grandparents which is 90% German, other Limburg dialect which is Dutch mixed with Italian and French developed by mine workers immigrants
It depends on the period in my life which language was dominant
Yes
Let's change the lingua franca of Euope once and for all
As for the two countries that have made English the lingua franca in most of the world: the US is a decadent and failing place, and the UK is not even part of Europe anymore

This sometimes confuses me aswell as a Dutch speaker
Uneducated language guy here
How vastly different is Irish from English
Can a native Englishman understand Irish whilst never having learned it and vice-versa
Is Irish taught at school
I’m sorry If I sound very ignorant,
I understood you have your own kind of special alphabet or something like that atleast someone told me that)
I honestly do like my accent, I've practised a lot to get a more neutral accent if I want to but the standard "Flemish" English accent is a sight to behold and always gets a smile on my face
I am from Flanders, which results in us having a pretty unnoticeable accent I think
As a French speaker , I can say that I really don't like it when people (including me sometimes) just speak English with an awful French pronunciation without even trying to have a better accent
On the other hand, when someone try to speak English with a good accent, every other French speaker around will make fun of him
Like he's a "mister-I-do-everything-better-than-you" while he's just trying to be understandable in English
Idk if I made myself clear but I have the feeling that the other French-speaker will understand exactly what I meant
When I talk to native speakers I try to coat it with the American accent I picked up when studying in the US to not be embarassing but other second language speakers I don’t really care does that even make sense
I feel like accents can make it seem like you don’t grasp the language properly enough to understand complex nuances and I don’t want it to influence a conversation/get questions about it I guess
Especially if it’s a professional environment I would rather it not slip out
I really don't like my accent :( I have problems with the R and people think I'm German
Even Germans
(I want to say sorry and offer my sincerest apologies for the quality of my English language skill
For you see, as a child, I spoke Lithuanian as a first language, and at the youthful age of 12 I began to learn English as a second language at the Lithuanian School for English Learners
I understand that the vast majority of Reddit have exemplary ability to read and write English, and I hope that my mere presence has not hindered your ability to enjoy this content on this website
Additionally, as I understand that Reddit is an American website, I hope that I have not misunderstood the American nuances of your language with my comment
Uh yeah
that’s what every Dutch person thinks
Not trying to be insulting I love Dutch accents haha
I'm not an expert in any of this so I can't tell you why the difference is there
But I can tell you my personal reason for using Android
1) Price, this is really the main thing
My phones generally cost around €100-150 ($109-163), you can find a decent smartphone for this price
To me a phone is just not worth $400-1000
Hell no, if I had a 500dollar phone, I'd be scared to use it, totaly nervous that I would accidentally forget it or it would get stolen
Not that I would like to lose my current phone, definitely not
But just price wise $100-150 is not the end of the world for me
It's an unfortunate loss but I can buy a new one immediately without having issues to pay my rent or buy groceries this month
Also I've seen lots of Iphones and Ipads from friends and acquaintances with cracked screens (still operational though)
I have my current phone (fyi Huawei, though I'm not brand loyal) for about 3 years now and I'm sure I've dropped it somewhere between 50 and 200 times
I also can't imagine dropping and cracking a 400-1000dollar phone, my god the guilt I would feel
(I once lost a ring worth 50euros and I felt super guilty, don't worry I found it back almost a year later
2) I'm not used to Apple products
My first phone was a [Sony Ericson] and at home we always used HP computers
I've never been familiar with Apple and I've never found the motivation to learn how to use it (this mainly applies to computers, if I have to use a Macbook for something, half of my time using it is spent on googling "how to ... on a Macbook".)
3) Apple tries to tie you down
From hearing things about Apple left and right, I feel like they really like to tie you down and make you buy only Apple
I really understand this from a marketing standpoint
But as a consumer I immediately have a flight reaction
I like compatibility (both in hard- and software)
Like when I get to someone else's house and my phone is dying
Generally it doesn't matter what brand they have (except for Iphone of course), there's a big chance they'll have the same charging cable and I can just use theirs
You can just pass the charging cable around to about anyone
But no, Iphones need their own specific kind that's not compatible to other phones, really annoying
I've also heard from some Americans (this is anecdotal, not sure how wide spread this feeling is) talk about how they bought an Iphone, only because many of their friends had Iphones and they used the chat app from Iphone that is not available on other phones
If they don't have an Iphone they basically get left out because they can't be part of certain group chats with their friends
Of course this is not purely Iphone's decision, the friends chose to use that app over other available apps
Still I don't like the idea of being forced (or forcing others) into buying a certain brand of phone so they wouldn't feel left out, I like the freedom to choose whatever I want and I want my friends to have that choice too
I really hope that many people keep on buying all different kind of brands and not let one brand monopolize the entire market
As for kids, most of them would definitely prefer to have an iPhone if they could but the price difference is often too big to warrant it
€150 - €300 for a decent latest generation Android phone vs
€700 - €1300 for one of the latest iPhones
Why would you buy an older model iPhone if you could get the latest and greatest stuff (smaller ports, bigger screen & battery) on a new Android phone for the same price
For adults it's even worse
Even though they could afford it, not a lot of them see the same "extra value" in an iPhone that kids do and will just buy a phone with the specs they need for the lowest possible price
Only a handful of them can see an "extra value" in features like face-time and the ecosystem and would go out of their way to buy an iPhone
For me personally it was never about price
But my 450 euro android is doing waaaaaaay better things than an overpriced iPhone anyway
So even if the prices were reversed, I'd buy the android phone
Everytime I post photo's, people ask me what I used to take them, well I used my 'cheap' android
I do have a macbook, it's expensive but for me it's worth it because when I bought it, there was no windows laptop that could top that
Now there are very great windows laptops but I'm used to mac
I would say that Apple is very popular over here, but rather 6/4 instead of 7/3
To me it would make more sense if it wasn't counted based on Android vs
Apple, price-based would be more interesting
And the "poor man's" iPhone/iPad isn't an Android, but that would rather be a 2nd hand iPhone/iPad or a low-end iPhone bought on credit
With Android phones usually you see the same
Top of the line are the flagships, and the poor man's phone will be an old flagship or something that's sold for half the price
People who don't care (no matter how much they have to spend) probably won't spend more than €200-€250 anyways
Reasons
I don't know
As far as I can see it, iPhone is that popular because they are more straight forward to use and for f.i. the chinese competitors people don't even know how to read/pronounce their names
Because Europeans buy products for their quality, not the social status associated with that product
*Snobby android-elitist snickering*
Calling someone gay because he has an iPhone
what
I posted this reply from my moto G!
its because somehow apple manages to uphold this image of being a "fancy" brand, look at the 700$ wheels
with no lock
While absolutely true, a lot of people are very vain about their phones
If it's the only status symbol you can afford and you care about that kind of stuff, you're likely to get it
Charleroi was considered [the ugliest city in the world] at one point
I can't disagree honestly
For Belgium it's probably Doel
Just like Oorderen, Wilmarsdonk and Oosterweel, this village was supposed to be demolished and absorbed by the harbor of Antwerp
Some locals just took the money from the government and moved somewhere else but others put up a fight in an effort to save their village
After the village got mixed messages for years, it's now a ghost town with only a few people still living there
If you ask me, they could've perfectly planned the harbor expansion around the little village
For an actual city though, it'd probably be Charleroi
It was once a wealthy industrial town but is now just a sad and dirty city in the most impoverished part of the country
Many people in my country would probably say Molenbeek, a neighbourhood of Brussels that has seen a lot of immigration during the last decade
It also used to be known as a terrorist hotspot
I have heard it is a really lively neighbourhood though
Also Genk has a bad reputation, and so do many neighbourhoods in Antwerp (Linkeroever etc
I haven't been in any of these towns myself, so I can't really say though
Was looking for this comment
Nah, that's going a bit too far if you ask me
I went to Marseille two years ago and I didn't feel that at all it was actually one of the most pleasant experiences I've had abroad
Non-euclidean is such a horrific and myserious way to say “geometry on a curved surface

I'm from Belgium (Flanders)
The public bus company is terrible here
We just say "De Lijn" (The Line, it's the name of the bus company) and everybody understands
Busses are usually late or just don't show up for no apparent reason
Traffic jams
Train delay/late
Bus delay/late
Traffic what else could it be
Always just the traffic
"The level crossing was closed"
"The bridge was open" (same like in The Netherlands)
"There was a huge 'unexpected' traffic jam" (most of the time caused by roadworks because we're Belgium)
"The road was extremely slippery due to snow
I needed to drive slower" (which most of the time means that there fell less than a centimeter of snow that directly melted)
As a high schooler here in Belgium I tend to go for "the bus was late" which is always true, not  my bus for sure, but a bus was definitely late enough to not be on time
Or I go with "I was biking into the wind"
In Belgium, more specifically West-Flanders it's 'I had to drive behind a tractor the whole way here'
our gloriously messed up traffic of course
especially in antwerp or brussels
There was construction on (insert main road here)
Except this isn't just an excuse, it's just a fact of life when you live in Belgium
De Lijn
Also, what I've heard and uses a lot: "We were behind the garbage truck" Although that may fall under traffic jam
I guess it's a joke
Just smudge your hands by grabbing the chain to make it more real
Never washes off entirely the first time so people'll notice you greasy fingernails
Is this also for if you're invited to someone's house to eat
Here, most people show up like 15 minutes after the agreed hour because showing up too early usually means everything isn't ready yet
if you can really call it a government that is
You misspelled Holland there
Oh okay makes sense

British spelling but I sound quite Midwest due to my ex and her family
I also adapt a bit when speaking
According to my friends it's quite funny, but I hate myself for it
I learned American English at school and you could lose marks if you wrote American or even if you spoke with an American accent
My last 2 teachers however don't care what you use, but you have to use either British all the time or American all the time
And I honestly don't know what is American and what is British
I didn't learn English in school but i had the opportunity to live in the U.S. because of my mother being Spanish/American and i learnt American English (which i think is the best one)
I try to be consistent in whatever I use
My school didn't care what kind you used, as long as it was consistent, so I try to make an effort to speak and write American

The taxi driver asking me, a student driving to a cheap ass motel to stay over the night and earning 1/10 of his salary, to give him a tip after paying $40 for a taxi drive 15 minutes away from the airport
This is after a trip to Manhattan and Miami(that one for work mostly)
1) How different women are treated over there
To put it a bit bluntly, they seem more separated in a way
Don't feel all that comfortable with the entire cheerleader thing
Skimpy clothes at a normal cocktail bar
Etc
Just got the feeling that in many situations I saw over there Belgian women would have gone "euh
2) Capitalism everywhere
I'm on a fucking internal flight in the US(Miami - Tennessee) and they're trying to sell shit while I'm on the plane, captive audience much
And again, that basketball game had a ton of other shit going on with people trying to make money
The basketball game seemed like almost an after thought with the amount of prices, games, etc
during the breaks and such
There is simply no peace and quiet to enjoy something you paid for without getting others to try and sell you something
If I compare that to going to a football game in Europe it was a rather big shock
Going to a sports game in the US seems more like a circus
3) The normal food sucks
Yes, I'm sure you can find good stuff
It's just that in most places I've been, there simply isn't much bad food to be found
You go to a B&B and the breakfast is fresh bread and baked goods
In Miami we got croissants packaged in plastic
4) How social everyone is
Problem
I have aspergers
Kindly turn it down
You at the hotel not being able to help me isn't some disaster and I'm not blaming you, not necessary to keep apologizing for it even though the idea of not having what I asked is so stupidly American I still found the situation hilarious
Manhattan was for fun and I'm happy I had a look around but I've seen it now and honestly not a whole lot I enjoyed
The shops are nice, the musical of the Lion King was amazing
Cool, cool
But at the end of the day nothing overly special imo
I don't know, because of historical reasons it just seems that trips to many European countries are more memorable
Seeing the Colosseum is more interesting to me than being on top of the One World Trade Center or whatever it's called and such
While the lower wages here are much higher(found out that an army recruit earns less than minimum wage in the US apparently) I still love just paying my construction workers 1
5 times the wage of other companies and just go and snoop of the skilled construction workers
Last one was a guy for the flooring last year
We earn several rewards with our projects, no more need for commercials or anything
Our costumers are doing all the work getting us new costumers
Yes, we're expensive
Yes, you can get this shit cheaper somewhere else
Just don't expect us to fix the bad work others do
I can't be the only European that was so confused when I heard about people putting their fist through a wall in anger

Police ran over and killed a 19 year old kid on a scooter in Brussels who tried to flee to get out of a €250 Corona-confinement-fine
The next day hords of migrant kids of the same neighborhood trash an empty police van and steal a gun laying inside
Videos being used by far right as jackoff material
Meanwhile the weather is getting better and people can't stay at home anymore because they're entitled assholes who think confinement is good but they're an exception
People are dying in retirement centers right now but the government thought it a good idea to allow one visitor per person

Eustache, Odilon or Prospeer for males
Colette for females
More or less the same for both French and Dutch
Josefien, Ludovica, Petrus, Frans
mostly Biblical names
Lucille is an old school french name
Jean-Eudes de la rocailles
Gheerwijn, Reinhard, Wolfhard for men
Liedewij, Hadewijch, Adelheid, Adolphine, Mathilda, Pieternel for women
I really wonder why
Esther is not considered an old timey name in Dutch
Odette and Honorine for females
Basically a lot of French names
Hey my grandma was called Odette :)
lol that's a nice way of putting it
But I understand though
After the Dutroux affair, there was a significant drop in newborns named Marc here too
I can see how for Adolf it much much worse
Haha same that's why I said it (same with Honorine)
TOO LATE but better late than never i guess
Let's say math, I know that best in dutch because that's how I was taught
But then I learn entire subjects in English and have an issue translating it in dutch or even begin sentences but notice how I can't nicely finish it in dutch
I think and dream in English
But my work also involves enough other people that my dutch doesn't suffer too much
Not with English, I only get this around Dutch-speaking people
Even though I don't speak with any particular local accent, when I'm in the Netherlands, my Flemish accent suddenly sounds very apparent and weird to me
My biggest problem (native Dutch speaker) is that I'll sometimes think in English, but then don't know how to translate those words/expressions to Dutch (because a lot of the time there isn't a perfect translation)
i sometimes forget dutch words, and when i remember them they for some reason sound weird
At around 16 we were learning more advanced tenses in English here in school and I was fluent in English
People came to me to explain these things
I had no idea
I just went with my gut feeling
Besides Dutch and French, German is also an official language thanks to a tiny part of Germany that we got after WW I.
Julius Caesar once wrote that the Belgians were the bravest cause they lived the furthest away of Roman civilization and were at constant war with Germanic tribes living across the Rhine
In 1990 King Baudoun was declared temporarily unable to reign for about 36 hours
This because he refused to sign the law that liberalised abortion
Belgium has the longest tramway in the world
This 67 kilometer long route is called the  Coast Tram and connects the cities and towns along the entire coast, between De Panne near the French border and Knokke-Heist near the Dutch border
Belgium has the world’s greatest number of castles per square meter
Ive been to Bulgaria with my mom when I was a kid and my mom didn’t speak the language but she understood a fair bit so every time she wanted to answer with a nod or a shake she would just end up making circles with her head and no one understood her XD
If I recall correctly Belgium actually has more castles per km².
Belgium likes to claim Beethoven since his whole family grew up here
His last name is also very Flemish and his father was  famous in Mechelen (Flanders)
Well, French and English have nearly the same structure of sentence, except for the order of adjectives and possessives
And even then, many adjectives in French can be put before the noun like in English
It's why English is very easy to learn for French-speaker natives who don't hate the UK or who don't show the laziness from/of the Francophonie for other languages
So, it isn't very interesting in the case of English spoken or written with the structure of French, because the difference is a bit hard to spot
The oddities main being : the "over-use" of "of" instead of "'s" ("pen of John" instead of "John's pen", and some adjectives put after the noun, such as : the already written "*oddity main*" instead of "main oddity", or "*flower blue*" instead of "blue flower" as other example
As you can see in this comment, I'm quite sure you didn't notice many/much differences with a sentence written in English normal, isn't it
I think not that that funny would be
But it could can work
The results were unsatisfying
These sentences are all typed in the sentence structure of my mother tongue
Seemingly are Dutch and English very similar
Shakespeare sounds often very weirdly Dutch-like in my experience
Reading Macbeth really had me laughing out loud at times
Ah no maybe
The sentence structure in the Finnish is apparently really odd
Thanks for your comment
mmmmh
I think that it a lot from population density depends
We are very bad here doing
Our government is also eh, there
Well yes we have a very interesting government .
Instructions are unclear but we are something new to trying
If that not works are we fucked
Actually six governments, to it easy making have we Flemish speaking community and flanders gewest combined ;)
Yes
Ever since they started building that stadium, years ago, I've stopped buying from the big sponsors that refused to pull out
Like McDonald's, Coca cola, Adidas
I feel like there's not much one can do, but I just don't want to support any company that plays part in this BS
Will also judge anyone who will still watch the world cup
pff no it's the only time where our country is united x)
It´s easy to take a knee for causes they think matter but in the end they wont mind playing in stadiums built with blood and bones
It's an absolute fraud
FIFA should take it responsibility an reschedule
yes
if they're gonna preach peace and love anytime they speak about football at least stick to your guns
No, because we need to win it and yes, because the situation is not the way to treat someone
If it is against EU regulations, then yes, we should
It's about time the world stops giving Americans special treatments
We only get shit on in return for it
Yes
13,5 - 15,5% really is a big part of the EU, so something should be done about this
In all the time, many countries involved (like Roumania this year) have had the Presidency of the Council of the European Union
No matter what the desired outcome should be, that's where they can discuss
The second level where this could be discussed is via diplomatic routes
But I absolutely don't agree that the desired solution is to santion the usa
I absolutely agree
I never thought I would say this, but the last few years Russia and China have proven to be much more reliable as an alie than the US
Not saying their governments are angels, but at this point there is no world power controlled by a developend set of brains
Regardless of which, Florida needs to be included
Florida man must be kept out of Europe at all costs
Imagine the destruction he'd cause here
This is the first I hear of this
Why are they against it
This indeed seems like a stupid reason for the boycot
You'd think they wouldn't feel this way towards an ally
Yes
Stupid was not a good way to put it
What I mean was that we should work more closely together and that a country's own value isn't always the most important inside an organ like the EU
"That's populism" - Elio DI Rupo (ex-president of the "socialist" party, ex prime minister and current president of the wallon government of belgium) responding to the offer of Raoul Hedebauw (far left politician) to cut government officials salary after mister Elio said they should cut the belgian workers salary to cope with the coronavirus economic repercussion
Probably not the stupidest thing, but still in my memory
Our prime minister Guy Verhofstadt around the 2000s thought it was a brilliant idea to pay off some debts by selling government administrative buildings
But where did all the civil servants go
To the same buildings, which are now in the hands of private companies who demand ridiculously high rent to make a profit
There is a video of my our vice-pm trying and failing to put a face mask

I spent a semester there, Erasmus, so, not in my case no
Everybody here seems well aware of Iceland's existence
I would like to refer to r/mapswithouticeland for proof of the contrary
Well, is long distance train transport still viable
Don’t you think we will first need a change of mentality, to use planes less frequently and instead use trains
I would support it, but I think we should first try to get good high-speed services between more centrally located cities
Only when this region has a robust and reliable network, we should try to expand it to farther regions, assuming that demand for these routes will have increased by then
I'm not saying this should take a long time, we just have to first develop a good model where the infrastructure already exists
(*This is assuming a lot of the funding would come from the EU, otherwise, each country can do whatever it wants
High speed, lower prices, reintroducing sleeper trains
maybe even extra motorail trains
I hope the future of European rail will be as bright as a lot of us want it to be
I would definitely support it
The more high speed trains, the better
I've partially traveled Norway by train last year and it was the most stunning train journey i ever took
We did Oslo-Røros, Røros-Trondheim
Then we stayed there for a week, drove with a rental car do Bergen and then took the train from Bergen to Oslo again
Oh yeah now i know what you mean, i thought you ment a railwaythat connects west EU and east EU
But yeah, i would happely pay taxes for such a project
Oh that’s nice, it would be nice for the climate too i think, cause planes are bad
And if the trains get comfy, with a bar and a restauration cabin, it could become part of the journey
Like the good old days
I would gladly use a train for a day or 2 instead of sitting in a plane for 3 hours all cramped up together
It will cost more tho
I agree, but the standardisation of the european railroads would bring the EU closer together, and if more subsidies went to trains, instead of planes, it would bring some benefits
Yeah but back in the 19th century-early 20th, trains were more comfy, with a bar and all
They were part of the journey
Unlike a plane where you just waste 3 hours untill you get to Your destination
But with long distance trains wouldn’t need to stay in your seat all the time, you should be able walk around, go to the bar
Yeah brussels to nice doesn’t need a bar, but when your journey is a day or more, that wiuld be usefull
And only 9 hours to venice
That’s oretty quick
Well it is purely an individual opinnion
I read basically everything, and will look for Belgians bc I will just comment my experience under theirs
I never see any Belgium people so I feel pretty lonely :(
I have seen them before but only very rarely
products from that company that sells that USB-cable that I accidently clicked on 2 weeks ago on the other hand
I used to get them a lot more but now there are a lot less of them so things are getting better in the world i guess i also remember getting similar ads for south east Asia and south america but they are gone now
Bro
I had no idea
I live in Belgium and even though I knew Russia is financially not so great, I could never imagine this
I really hope there'll be change in the future
Till then, try not to get sick I guess
In the Georgian language, 'siri' means cock/penis
So whenever I'd say 'Hey Siri' my family would look at me in shock
I was initially confused by the term: "**a fortnight**", I thought it was waaay less
* At first I'd imagine it be 4-5 days, as it could stem from "the fourth night" or "five days, four nights". Alas
* Or maybe it's even tonight or tomorrow
As in "the forthcoming night
" Nope
Turns out it's from *fourteen nights*, and it's a term for 2 weeks
Oh well, at least they don't use "fifteen days" like in French
not in english, but frensh has the world "spleen", and the first time I heard it I though it was stolen from english, but it turns out its from french poet Baudelaire
that and someone mentioned the fact that footing (french world for jogging) is not a world in english
Entomology is the study of insects
Autocorrect mistake
By the way, I never interpreted apartheid as otherness, but as separateness in Dutch
In 95% of cases, apart means separately over here
Apart meaning strange is not used very often in Flanders
Speaking of which, I have another language anecdote related to dicks
In Georgian, we pronounce 'dude' this way : 'katso', which sounds exactly like the Italian word 'cazzo' (penis)
My uncle was in an Italian restaurant talking to his friend in Georgian like : 'Dude, forreal, I was just
blablabla, dude
Everyone in the restaurant was like wtf
Overmorgen in Dutch
That would be correct
Yes, but when you say 'English' you don't think of the US, do you
Yet I'm assuming you have the largest amount of English speaking population
Yeah I meant it as 'I am English' and 'I am Spanish'.
Maybe it's because the US is more aware of England than Spain
Summers on the other hand are like being in Satan’s buttcrack we got like 39 degrees for a while its absolutely not normal and very worrying
Same
The last time we got real snow where I live was like
3-4 years
Didn't we get a decent amount of snow last winter
I remember it was a real pain in the ass with all the snow for getting to my exams on time
Not really no
We had some snow, but nothing that didn't immediately melt
Last time we had some snow that stayed for at least a couple of days was 4 years ago IIRC
When I was a child (10 years ago or so) we had snow that stayed for about a week once r twice a year
Do you still live in Greece
In my mind Greece us way too hot to ever have any snow but since you seem to recall it, I must be mistaken
Occasionally, when a German tourist is being a dick, people would say "fucking German tourists" but there's no hostility towards Germans any more for the WWII thing, especially not among younger people
Germans are actually often seen as hard working and efficient people
"Oh it's made in Germany
It's probably good quality then"
I'd say it isn't a thing anymore in Belgium
However, when I told my grandmother a few years ago that I was going to Germany on holiday, I saw her tense up for a split second and look at me warily
She was a teenager during the war and still remembers it vividly
That aside, she would never be rude to someone from Germany or mention it
Belgian here
No anti-German sentiment, but I do expect a lot from Germany as a country
WW1 and WW2 has caused immesurable suffering to my country and my family - many of my ancestors fought in both wars and didn't survive
I feel that it is Germany's duty now to be the champion of the EU and European unity
And I do feel they are showing leadership and solidarity, which is good
I also like that Germany doesn't shy away from its dark past and that it acknowledges and highlights the horrid mistakes from the past
That shows a collective maturity that many individuals don't even possess
Most of our train are either made in Germany or designed in Germany so yeah !
Europe really doesn't hate Germany
Perhaps certain individuals, mostly older people
Time heals all wounds, WW2 is still fairly recent
It will pass
Wait how happen that they are late then ?
The clothes brand "diesel" is italian and not american
Was convinced that La Trappe beer was either Belgian or French, but definitely not Dutch
still very good though :)
No problem my friend ,you can say the truth
It is apparebtly indeed French, but Belgium is the country with the biggest fries tradition
They're just a lot better here
How can it seem so Spanish with a French name
Roland sounds French though
"Too big" isn't sweden and finland the same size of germany
Megan fox i think(becaus the phone changes to a robot) i am not sure it is long ago
Can you translate it because my french sucks
sorry
And the things we eat with them at our "frietkot" is also just very Belgian
What is the Spanish word for carrefour/crossroad in Spanish
I had classes of Spanish in high school and university, but haven't used the language in/since years
Is there a possibility the french goverment paid the guy to lie
I like salt on my belgian fries, that is true
Sorry i don't understand what you mean, explain pleas
Is it about the world cup
This is my opinion, you won, the goals where real goals so no problem but these  last 5 minutes though(you saw mbappe and neymar are teammates)
Since that moment all Belgians hate Mbappe lol
What an asshole
No surprise the whole country supported Croatia
Yeah, unfortunaly they lost but i have still a lot of respect for their national team
Same, imo they played better except for like 10 minutes when France scored twice
Even Giroud, France's attacker, stayed at 30 meters from his own goal for basically the whole game
Maybe use the funds they get from taxes and instead of bombing other countries, you could use it to help your own people
Both would be more difficult as taxes will rise
From our pov, the US system is expensive if you have health insurance and disgusting if you don't (or if you got tricked by your insurer)
There are plenty of examples in Europe that prove it can be done better
Will any of our systems work in the US, just copy paste
Probably not
A lot of stuff would need to change, and changing stuff as vital as healthcare could lead to short term massive disruptions, causing a lot of harm
However, if your politicians know what they are doing, meaning if they listen to the god damn experts, it is possible to gradually work towards any type of system they want
It doesn't even have to be federal
What still slightly boggles my mind is why there still isn't bipartisan support for anything
In Belgium, all parties from far left to far right agree that our current system is something good that should be preserved
Some parties may think there is room for improvement of efficiency and (naturally) want to cut the budget, forcing the industry to grow more efficient or suffer problems (more likely outcome)
Others want to expand the budget, lowering the price for the patients even more, eventhough that might not be financially sound for the state
But somewhere in the middle is an optimal point
The art is to find it and stay near it
Some specific costs details for medical treatments: (each country has different laws and systems) . For western europe (belgium in my case):
In case of sickness (flew or something) basicly everything is covered
A basic doctors visit will cost you +-28 EUR (could be wrong) for a checkup and is almost fully payed back
Today with some doctors, they have a system where the bill is automaticly send to the insurance company and you don't have to pay anything
And the any little remaining costs that might remain will be charged instantly by the insurance company
Prescription drugs are fully payed back, non prescription drugs are not payed back
&#x200B;
A hospital treatment is for the largest part payed back
The poorest people don't have to pay anything
Everything together of these extra costs will never cost more than what somebody can afford
People never ever need to (or very rarely )  pay of a long lasting debt due to hospital treatments
For regular and high income people **things that are not payed back** (or only limited) are:
Accommodation costs: Costs for your stay such as use of room and bed, meals and nursing assistance
You only pay a small personal share in the daily price
But if you chose a single room, you will also be charged a room supplement
Fixed costs: The hospital may charge part of the costs per admission with a fixed amount
Pharmacy: Costs charged by the hospital's pharmacy, for example for medicines, implants and medical devices
Professional fees: The fees for doctors and other healthcare providers for which you have to pay a personal share or supplement
The supplement may only be charged if you chose a single room
choosing to be treated by a doctor/professor of your choice
Other deliveries: Costs for blood products and plaster materials, among other things
Patient transport: Costs for non-urgent transport
Miscellaneous costs: Non-medical costs such as additional room comfort and requested drinks
aesthetic procedures: aesthetic (plastic) benefits such as breast augmentation
European countries took a long time to get healthcare right, but had each other to learn from
I think Americans expect the government to implent a fully functional healthcare system by tomorrow
In that case you can only rush things and you will never get things right
For a country as big as the US it might take years if not decades just to get the reoroganisation right
And with a government as unstable over long periods as that of the US that's going to be hard task
Many European countries have universal healthcare but barely any of them have _single payer_ healthcare
Many work with a private insurance model
So as everybody here only mentions the good side i would also like to share some of the negative aspects
(I'm all for universal healthcare, but differences will allways exist, and a perfect system doesn't exist
In belgium there are 2 types of hospitals
There are university hospitals and private hospitals
One of the biggest differences is how a doctor wants to pursue a career
In university hospitals you will have to engage in academic research rather then solely medical ttreatments (professor vs doctor)
Overal a professor gets a higher pay and higher respect from coleagues
However that doesn't mean a professor is smarter/better then a doctor, but if you want to earn more you will have to pursue an academic career also
So in university hospitals if you want to make more money (without doing academic research) you will have to go work at a private hospital
These pays can be better, but it also means you can open a private practice should you want that
In a university hospital it is a bit more difficult to open a private practice parallel to your job as a professor/doctor in a university hospital
University hospitals tend to loose good doctors that don't want to pursue an academic career
Another negative thing (depends on which hospital and which area ) is the waiting times for non emergency situations
Another thing is insurance companies will rarely sue hospitals or complain why the bill is not consistent or when they believe the bill is too high ... bc everything is state supported financially
This at the same time also is beneficial as hospitals themselves are less afraid of being sued and don't need more expensive insurances themselves
But it also means that the goverment will have a harder time tracking costs
Bad idea
People who refuse to work like cleaning hospitals, shouldn't be entitled to get the services
The issue is that America is still very beneficial for rich people, causing a brain drain
Most PhD graduates in the USA aren't American, for instance
We shouldn't aim to make a system where America's poor go into the world, and the world's wealthy go to America
Same for any other country
Porque no los dos
The end of a costly war + communist threat = a real possibility for a communist uprising
So appease your workers with some democratic socialist policies like cheap healthcare and strong social security
Happened twice in Belgium
After WW1, lots of stuff came through
After WW2, same thing plus women finaly got to vote
and that should be corrected, it's a shame
In EU it should also be changed
Not everyone who works has the hospitalisation insurance
Both in the workforce and the army, the numbers become less relevant
Very common
I always drink tap water but I also know people that refuse to drink tap water for some reason
I have a filter on a separate faucet and only basically drink that
But I'm cheap
The idea of paying for drinks is just dumb imo when you can get it for (nearly) free
Overall I think most buy bottled still water
Bottled water is considered fancier and is given to guests
Very common
Even our sparkling water can now be tap water thanks to Sodastream
in belgium people just drink trap water, and those who drink bottled water either do so out of habit or because they want to drink water on the way
the exceptions are some villages in wallonia with really old water pipes, resulting in some metals going in the water
you can still shower with that water though, just don't drink it
i was in france, and in some cities the water is perfectly drinkable but doesn't taste that good, so i drank bottled water
>Also, unlike in other countries, our bottled water is not just tap water put in a bottle, it has to be collected directly from a spring
I thought all bottled water must be collected from a spring
At least this is the case in Belgium and it doesn't change the fact that we usually drink tap water (which is very hard)
in belgium too :D
Yeah I experienced this when visiting the US
I allways drink bottled water because I don't like the taste of tap water where I live, but a lot of American bottled water tastes just as bad
I learned to look specifically for spring water instead of purified water but I still don't get why someone would buy tap water in a bottle
Always 'that makes no sense´ bcs you can say ´that makes no ´ in dutch but sense hasn't a translation so then youre stuck
Just one hour ago I was reading in a French book that I have to read for French (as always the topic really doesn't interest me), and I saw *alumettes*. I know what they are
I could translate it to English (matches, like the kind you use to light up candles)
For the life of me I couldn't translate it to Dutch
I looked it up, and had a "of course"-moment when translate told me it was *lucifer*.
No you can say that but not if you already st1rted with ´that makes no ´ bcs the ordr of the words is wrong then
Yeah but I meant that when you are already saying 'dat maakt geen
' you have to start over
Same in Flanders
Sometimes we use the Dutch word, sometimes the French word and sometimes the English word
French is mostly used for car mechanics and bicycles, English for more modern technology
Serve beer in the wrong glass
Everybody hates it when this happens
Saying that waffles represents our country
We like waffles as much as the next man but we'll drop a waffle in a split second for a Jupiler with some fries and mayo
Saying hello to anybody on the street and/or looking friendly at them
They will assume you want something or want to mug them
The Flemish part of Belgium is very very very conservative in that sense
And even if you do one of these things, they will look at you as if you're a murderer
I am so glad that I knew this before spending 6 months on exchange in France
>I don’t know how to add that cool flair thing
Go to the sub, press the 3 dots in the upper right corner and press 'change user flair' if you're on mobile
As a Belgian person I use both Holland(er) and Nederland(er)
But generally when I'm talking to a Dutch person I use 'Nederland(er)'. I've noticed that it really annoys some Dutch people when you say 'Holland'. But then again I've met Dutch people that did not care at all and even ones who use 'Holland' themselves
I generally just play on the safe side
Or beer without/to little foam, you are a barbarian if you do that
In Brussels I have been served a 6€ Duvel in a plastic glass once
Did you pay
Yeaahhhhh sometimes it do be like that hahaha
But when you're an extrovert, it's not the best thing to have all around you lol
It's not a huge difference but Belgians are definitely a bit more reserved
Haha no problem
Yes, a joining together does not seem like a good idea
Better a good neighbor with different habits than a housemate with different habits
Starting june 13 2010 we didn't have a government for 541 days
Currently we are without a federal government since the 26 may 2019
Fingers crossed for a new record
Last, I dont know
But we still have the record of country without government for the longest period of time
Here, more people speak Arabic than German
Technically, we do have a federal government at this time, so the new record wouldn't count for the guniness book of world records (yes, it's actually in there)
Portugal and Finland are somewhat similar, both have one win, but never finished top 5 outside of that victory
In that case the first shouldn't count neither because we had a government of running affairs "Leterme II". That one had the same democratic value as the current Wilmes I.
Could you imagine the outrage if that would happen
Vlaams Belang would get a majority on its own
Mercyful Fate is one of the biggest traditional heavy metal bands even
I once walked through a Belgian park with a german exchange student
We came across a big group of statues of people, and he asked what it was about
It was a bit awkward when I told him it commemorated the martyred civilians who were killed by the Germans in WWII, as revenge for some action by the Belgian resistance
Well actually, I was surprised he didn't feel weird about it, as I did
He explained how he regards it as something the Nazis did, separate from what Germans are (which is true I suppose)
Whereas we've always joked about the Germans as the enemy  invaders
Not in a malicious way, but rather like when you hear a loud bang, or see some old planes flying, someone will joke 'to the defenses, the Germans are back
It keeps the memory more alive I think
Edit with literal line: 'Luchtafweergeschut
Den Duits is daar
' (Anti-aircraft artillery
The German is there
Can't blame people today for things that happend nearly 100 years ago
So I don't think so
Europe has been a war zone for thousands of years
To me it seems that it's all seen as "history", and not related to today's countries
Apart from nazi Germany, most wars aren't seen as good vs evil, but just a very long list of power hungry rulers
This way we can work together without resentment
Balkan wars are too recent for the anger to have subdued
Unfortunately, nationalistic parties have been using old wars to instill hatred towards anything foreign
I'm Belgian-Moroccan of Amazigh heritage, I guess it's kinda related to European history but contemporary Moroccans still make jokes about the Ottoman empire conquering most of North Africa except for our country, I brought this up to a Turkish friend of mine and he found it hilarious
Not really, since the *country* of Belgium does not have much war crimes or bad history, except the Congo
As Belgians we don't really feel sensitive with this subject, but African people here instantly say that the entire country is bad and the money should be returned etc
I feel second hand embarrassed
Jesus chrost
Have the Russians ever attacked the Netherlands
War is a story about people after all as much as it is about nations and ideologies
The jude law movie
my guess would be food and weather
both in terms of health and happiness
sun and pasta, no depression, happiness forever
Our country is the definition of bad weather, stress and depression
i agree, as long as a british person doesnt enter the chat :D
We have the 100-dagen/50-dagen (100 days)
The last 100 days of secondary school, the last graders dress up in some funny costume and party in the school
It’s a bit different from school to school, but our theme was farm land so everyone dressed up as farmer/animal, we had hay all over the school ground and even inside the school building, we made a farmer decor for the hallways etc
For the teachers room, we made memes about our teachers and displayed them over there
The night before and after, people go partying so usually they arrive at school drunk
Then school gave us breakfast and we went to do karaoke
In the afternoon you have to clean up and then after that you can party again
Our school had a farm and on 100 dagen we released 2 pigs in the hallways, #1 and #3
In Belgium we don’t do something before taking exams but you do something related to your final 100 days in high school
At my school this started on the thursday night when you go out and party
During this night students do some stuff to their school
We let 4 chickens loose in the building and sprayed 1,2,4,5 on their back so the teacher would lose their mind to find nr 3
These pranks used to be next level, but seniors the year before us basically vandalised the school (ductaping firecrackers on the inside of a toilet and basically destroying 5-6 toilets) so the principal decided to sleep in school and make sure nothing serious would happen
After that you would go to school on friday morning and do all kinds of activities (we got breakfast, physical test to prove you’re not still drunk, ‘fancy’ lunch and then go bowling)
After that you have a parade through the city of your school where all the seniors have to dress up and parade through the town
After this parade the town organises another party
We have Chrisostomos, 100 schooldays before the end of the year, the people from the last year have something, in most of the schools they do pranks I think, in others real shows but they are all drunk
In Belgium (Flanders at least) we have 100 dagen (100 days)
It's a day where the people who are in their last year of secundary school can go nuts
They don't have any lessons that day and they all go dressed as something/someone crazy and use water guns to shoot on all the other students that aren't in their last year
In my school it's the day before eastern break
They order a bouncy castle to play on, they block the entrance of the school with a whole parcour and they  can do anything (that is reasonable) with some of the teacher's classes
(Like filling one with hundreds of balloons, or sticking newspapers on literally all walls, desks, chairs
and so much more)
This year it's my turn and I'm so fucking excited
It's probably the most fun day of your whole school carrier by then

We had a full week to dress up with a different theme each day
We also had to clean up before getting breakfast
Then we went paintballing
at our school, we have a whole week of dressing up, cantus and party ending with flashmob-ish acts for the whole school to enjoy next week will be "keihard knalleuh"
No such thing in Wallonia
Mad

In my school a month ago or so
I really miss that day
where I live they do the 50 days, somewhere in April or so

The only Belgian French accents I ever heard, was in a satyrical comedy with an over the top accent
And it was fun
Never heard a non native try to speak Flemmish
In Wonder Woman she talks to a woman in Belgium so normally she would speek Dutch or french or German but instead they speak this messed up thing that sounds a very little bit like Dutch but it’s like totally translated with google translate
[This scene by Anne Hathaway in "The Hustle" comes to mind] I can understand it if I pay close attention to it but when I first heard it in theaters I literally did not understand a word of what she was saying
At least some of them nail it
(I can watch that scene over and over)
That is exactly what came to mind for me
I mean, since the movie is set in World War 1 it wasn’t a surprise to me it would end up taking place in Belgium
But to then suddenly hear someone speak with a perfect Flemish accent was a welcome surprise
And then they switched to Peter walking through a field of tulips with a windmill in the background
They really wanted to tick off all the boxes
Just missing the weed/coffee shops and some dikes
There's also 2 windmills in the background of the market and a windmill on each side of the tulip field
holyshit that scene is disgusting
do they think everyone in the benelux is still in "de jaren stillekes"
yea its so weird, i'm not even a native french speaker but we obviously get it in school and lots of french in movies just sounds like bad high school french
It's not a real interview
It's from the Flemish sketch show In De Gloria
Generally yes, unless we see it's Dutchmen
Then we say it in French
In Belgium it's the tradition to spit in you palm and high five each other when you meet on a mountain
Luckily we don't have mountains here
Well I mean we don't really have mountains here, but we're all apathetic as hell so I don't really think we would
We do say hi in bars and the chip shop, so that's something
u/joelhelg :Flag-xx: Custom location is being plagued by a terrible civil war at the moment
You'll have to visit later, my friend
Coincidence that this was posted on December 6th
(Sinterklaas in the Netherlands and Belgium)
Eating horse meat is considered crazy abroad I guess
I'd guess that'd be the fact we eat raw meat, I've seen people lose their mind when I tell them that it's normal to eat prepared minced meat, aka an american steak which is raw meat and no its not american, i really dunno why it is named as such
It's not exclusive to belgium though, the netherlands does that too and as well Germany
I saw it once in Edinburgh, I thought I was being scammed first when asked
Well blackface is one that comes to mind this time of year
I don't know if it's that uncommon in other countries, but eating fries at least once a week
[Dutch Super Mom in action]
Also applies to Belgium
Basically countries where it's transport people aren't wearing a helmet
Countries where it's an activity they're more likely to do so
It's common here which is no surprise of course
No, it's the common way to say hello in Belgium too
With just one "kiss" though, not two
Also in Belgium, makes me think that all these comments from the Netherlands also in apply in Belgium lol
I've heard there are police jobs in the US that require you to live nearby
As a result the beginning wage is over 100k.
I guess it kind of makes sense, you need people there who do these types of jobs as well and if you pay them a normal wage nobody would ever show up to do them
Well he pays us a visit during the night between the 5th and 6th
Fun fact, in some parts of Belgium it's three kisses (can confirm unfortunately)
US and UK seem to be more averse to it than other Western countries
I didn’t know that, thanks
Yea, doing a cousin marriage once isn't going to lead to deformities
We would be extinct as a species if it did
The problem is if you do it over many generations
Cargo bikes (wheelbarrow bike) are expensive
Decent models easily cost a few thousand euros
I don't get why she hasn't taught the kids to ride for themselves though
I'm bad at guessing kids ages but 2 of them look at least 6 if not older, a normal age to ride in traffic themselves in the Netherlands
Really
Where
Where I am in Belgium (Brabant wallon) we find the 2 of the French already odd, I can't imagine 3 !
Yeah, is that weird
Here it’s legal to drink beer and such at 16
Stronger drinks like whisky or jenever or anything like it is allowed at 18
I live in Limburg (in the north), so maybe it's because we live close to the Netherlands
If I'm not wrong they do 3 kisses there
Although if we meet up with friends of my parents who live in the south of Limburg, we do 3 kisses as well so maybe it's just in Limburg in general, no idea
How is one more intimate than two
To me 2 or 3 seems much more intimate, since the contact is longer
I have heard that Limburg has its own kind of culture indeed, quite different from historical Flanders, and "new Flanders" (Brabant and Antwerpen, which weren't part of the county/duchy of Flanders)
How true is that
Is it that different
I personally don't notice a big difference, obviously another dialect but I guess that's it
I see, well, here the "kiss" is not really a kiss, it's a "cheek-on-cheek", we don't use the lips, so
Using the lips is only with partner, or maybe family
Zalig kerstfeest en een gelukkig Nieuwjaar
Joieux Noël et bonne année !
For some reason I can only think of stuff that has to do with the Chinese right now, eventhough I'm sure we have expressions with other countries too
\*'Chinese vrijwilliger '(a Chinese volunteer): someone who's forced to do something even if they don't want to
Generally in the context where no one (out of a group) wants to do something/no one wants to volunteer, so a 'Chinese volunteer' is chosen
In my experience it's generally used when no-one voluntarily answers in class or if someone has to do an annoying chore
\*'Met alle Chinezen, maar niet met den dezen
' (With all the Chinese, but not with this one): used when you feel like someone is trying to fool you or trying to convince you (of something that is not true) and you want to tell them that you're not that gullible/stupid, they won't fool you
So I guess Chinese here probably refers to 'a lot of people', like you might be able to fool a lot of people but not this one (me)
\*'Dat is Chinees voor mij' (That's Chinese to me): Basically we use Chinese instead of Greek (That's Greek to me)
We call that splitting the bill instead of going Dutch
I never heard that expression before
Roken als een turk= smoking like a turkish guy, you say it when you see a person smoking a lot of sigarets
Huh, I always figured "going dutch" was because the Dutch have a tendency to be frugal/cheapskates
'Spaanse furie' (Spanish fury) is one that comes to mind
It's an expression used to refer to someone who has no control over their anger and emotions
It traces back to a series of bloodbaths inflicted by mutinying Spanish soldiers during the Eighty Years' War, most notably the [Sack of Antwerp]
Roken als een Turk = To smoke like a Turk = smoking a lot
Joke or not
Going Dutch means drinking with 2 straws from the same drink at a bar to save a bit of money here in Belgium
I really hate to say this but if it stays like this for long sanctions should be imposed on Hungary or they should be kicked out of the EU
Only democracies are allowed, that has always been the case (That's why Liechtenstein isn't part of the EU e.g.)
I really hope that something changes and the hungarians realise this is not the way
Good luck over there
Some older people in West Flanders, if they speak their dialect can be hard to understand
Younger people tend to speak a cleaner version of the dialect
I when people from West-Flanders are speaking to me, I'm always wondering what they actually say
Everyday life here in Belgium
If someone's gonna start talking rough West-Flemish, dear lord I am not gonna understand a single thing they're saying
This happens all the time if i leave my home town belgium has many dialects
Honest to God, I've got no idea who began the "neuken in de keuken" thing or why it sticks
I've literally never heard the phrase being said by anyone expect people who don't speak Dutch
And I can't understand dialects from the north of the Netherlands and I have trouble understanding Limburgish
Like Aya Nakamura, I don't understand anything about her lyrics
Yeah some are Low Saxon
But tbh, I even have trouble understanding someone speaking Standard Dutch if they have a really thick Dutch accent
I can understand that perfectly
Idk but I've had some cases where I couldn't understand people even though they were speaking Standard Dutch
In Belgium, they tell you you'll be cleaning up the s\*\*\* behind the train
I don't know where this comes from, as I haven't heard anything about human excrements just being disposed of on the tracks
My parents used to say I should study well, or become a guy that picks up the shit falling from the trains
Old trains in Belgium didn't have a septic tank an everything was just dumped on the tracks
There was even a rule you could not use the train toilets when stopped in a station for this reason
I highly doubt this was ever a real profession, but the threat was quite effective
I think it's that you'll work in the Panos or the Colruyt
(This is coming from a Leuvenaar) Colruyt is one of the biggest supermarket-chains in Belgium and Panos is something kind of like Subway
.. or you'll be collecting horse shit behind the tram
That must have been going for multiple generations now
I have no idea when the last horse tram stopped working over here
We used to say "straatveger" in Dutch which is a street cleaner or "ramasseur de poubelles" in French which is a garbage man
But I don't use that comparison, because cleaners and garbage men are just as important to society as any other job
I'm against job shaming, unless your job is instagram influencer or some useless fuckery like that
Same, my dad woke up with me at 6 am on a vacation in spain to look at the garbage truck passing by
That we don't all speak
German
Yes, German
I was in London last year with my school
6 people asked from where we were and when we said Belgium, 4 of them said: "Oh so you speak French
" and 2 of them said: "Oh so you speak German
" We're from a school in Flanders so we all speak Dutch
We are not French and Dutch people put together
And even if they helped, we aren't a creation of the British
A lot of people seem to think that the only language spoken in Belgium is French
I've even had a German telling me that - when hearing me speak Dutch - I should stop speaking fantasy languages
She didn't mean it to be denigrating, she *actually* thought I was speaking a made-up language
Some folks think that we aren't a country
So I tried to explain them that we are
But I had to dig in so deeply in to the subject that I had to conclude that we might not be a country
I mean we still don't have a (functional) federal goverment ... .
Total confusion about what Brussels and/or Belgium are, I've seen many forms of: brussels is the capital of europe, belgium is a country in Brussels (???), shit like that
When we get to the topic of governments and languages it's basically hopeless haha
Every american thinks we all speak French, when Flemish (Dutch dialect) is actually the dominant language, this includes most american redditors I've seen talking about the topic
That it was us Belgians that invented fries
It's weird that so many people think the French did (probably doesn't help that the Americans call them ”French fries”)
Ok, that's even dumber than my story
Spanish in Switzerland lol
Less than 1% of the population (only about 70,000 people) has German as a mother tongue
Yes, but it’s less than 5%
Your citoyenneté has now been revoked
Liam Neeson IS Zeus
Have you never seen Clash of Titans
Yup that pretty much sums it up
They publish an official dictionary every year adding "new" words but no one gives a shit not even french teachers
Learn some history and get out your Dutch bias
Belgium as a concept is older than the Netherlands, even if its independence is more recent
The whole low countries area was called Belgica
If anything, it's the Dutch that are Belgians, and not the other way around
And Walloons only spent 20 years under France, they have barely no common history with it, since they were part of the Holy Roman Empire
During Roman time yes, but not during the Middle-Age : [Leo Belgicus]
I support mandatory vaccinations for dangerous illnesses
Idc if you got a flu shot or not, but please stay away from me if you didn’t get vaccinated against polio
Edit: obviously exceptions should be made for people who, for medical reasons, cannot be vaccinated
Mandatory vaccination should be a must
Anti-vaxxers are as dumb as the flat Earth crowd
I dont give a shit about your beliefs
We dont want kids to carry diseases we know we can prevent
I also read vacation 2 times
Vacation is already mandatory in Belgium btw, or at least paid vacation days are mandatory
There I’d make it mandatory for older people and young kids, and people who often get in contact with them (teachers, nurses etc)
I personally don’t think literally everyone should get a flu shot
I Belgium I don’t think it is aloud to not take your vacation and rather get paid a premium
At least I have never heard of such a thing here
I don’t think flu shots should be mandatory but I think they should be recommended
My job offers free flu shots every year and I always get one
Even if the flu is less dangerous for me
Herd immunity is still a thing, I will be less likely to infect someone who couldn’t survive a bad flu virus
I also get one every year, I’d rather prevent than cure it :)
I like that one
There are a lot lot more party destinations
Some
of them skanky some of them not
Having been to ibiza for many years in the 90s and also now recent years
Ibiza has become some sort of 'upscaled' expensive version of a party island
It is also the only one where there is also a monaco type of jetset
And also a celebrity hotspot (sportstars, popstars)
Because it is so much more expensive, it filters out some types of malbehaving tourists
Mykonos is also an upscale party destination that has done it's effort of losing a possible negative image
Magaluff is known for being the skankiest most dirty party destination
There , local authorities are cracking down on bars and places to try to find violations
Local authorities tried working together with british police officers to try and stop malbehaviour of british tourists
(Overal people feel most malbehaviour comes from brits and germans)
Thank god for friends with pools because I am not made for any weather above 25 degrees without being in the immediate surrounding of a pool
After the last 2 summers I have airconditioning everywhere and I work from home so I'm good :p.
It's the third day that it's about 30 degrees here (for a Belgian that is considered hot, I don't have air conditioning or electric fans)
I'm happy it's going to cool down from tomorrow onwards
The way I coped:
Day one was pretty easy
I cooled off my apartment at night and in the morning
Then at around 8am I shut all the windows and in my room (where I wasn't spending any time during the day) I even closed the curtains
My windows are facing North, which is very unfortunate during most of the year, but on these days it really does help
Only around 17-20pm I get a few slivers of sunlight in the apartment
So the temperature was really okay when I was working at home, only towards the evening I was overheating a bit
Day 2, same scenario
Cooling it off at night as much as I can, shutting everything at 8am
It was a bit warmer than day 1 but still very bearable until the evening
Today was a lot more difficult, I had all my windows wide open at night, but I didn't feel like it cooled down at all
So today was a lot hotter to live through
I don't have many other tips except for, drink a refreshing drink (from the fridge or with ice cubes) and I also use a plant spray bottle
I mainly put it next to my bed and when I get into bed or sometimes when I wake up at night, I spray some water in the air and let it fall on me
It's a really nice cooling feeling, it only lasts for like half a minute, but it's still very helpful I feel
Yesterday I had to study for my history exam (if you can even call it an exam) but it was so hot that I had difficulty’s with just concentrating and staying focused
its ehhh yea, we're baking
and then i'm in a hot kitchen at work wearing a mask, its great
I felt so lethargic in the two last days from just waiting in the living room that the heat is over
Now it's over ! It went down to 24°C and tomorrow will be max 21°C.
Calling the cops on them is
probably somewhat insensitive at the moment, I presume
It was fine
I could easily answer the first half of the exam
The other half was a bit harder but I still made it
And thanks for asking
Most of us find that if its lunch/dinner time its so busy and stressful that its not so big of a problem/dont notice it too much
Have a towel nearby to wipe sweat and go outside for 10 seconds when we can haha
I advise putting all windows open at night and then close them in the morning
Then keep the curtains, doors and windows closed all day
You’re absolutely right
Stay safe out there :)
We had the same problem but now we use these screens in front of windows with tiny holes to small for insects (I don't know what it's called in English)
I think they're called window screens or bug screens
I'm extremely thankful to the person who invented those
Depends on which country but I think it's less useful to have permanent screens if you live in a country where it's not warm enough to leave open your doors and windows most of the year
Screens take away from your hopefully beautiful view and it stops you from putting your head/hand (whatever bodypart) out of the window
Though many people I know have some type of removable screen that they can put in certain windows in their house or sliding doors during hot days
You could ask this question in r/Askhistorians possibly
Be aware it is a heavily (but well-) moderated sub
Massive french centralization did that pretty much
Rural france is ghost towns by ghost towns because everyone left those towns as it's just shitty to live there without infrastructure as everything is based on the big cities of France, the rest are literally ignored by the french state
Well, in my opinion the moderation is very well done on that sub
The rules are clear and always followed, it's just that they are very strict
Which I get
They, as is natural for historians, rely heavily on sources (as should happen more imo)
They do not allow any unsourced answer, and they only allow credible sources as well
I think it's a good policy
You go to that sub for a professional opinion of a historian
Not someone who thinks they know the answer because they heard someone say it some time ago
Omg yes
You could turn it into a sub and just post them so it feels like it's the woman herself writing it directly to us, if that makes sense
"Belgians are born with a brick in their stomach
" Alluding to the fact that every single Belgian seems to want to buy or build their own house and keep renovating it during their lifetimes
Een baksteen in de maag, translated to "born with a brick in the stomach" at least in Flanders, because we like to build our own house
It is said we have a "brick in our stomach" because we like to build stufd, decorate, rearrange our interiors, etc
We say that Belgian people are born with a brick in their stomach
Very true from my experience
My father built his own house (he actually did a lot of the manual work himself)
Most of my aunts/uncles bought ground and built a house on it
And the few who bought an existing house still did or are planning to do a big rennovation
And even when the house is 'done' (like it ever really is) then there's still a shed to build, the terrace, carport etc
Of course this depends on the finances of people
Most of my family is doing financially alright so they can affort to buy ground/house and on top of that, it was 15-30 years ago when those  things were already more affordable
I have a few people my age (20"s-30's) in my family who are now buying a house or looking into buying a house
And the houses they can afford are easily half or one third the size of the houses of the generation of my parents/aunts/uncles
Eventhough job-wise they don't have lower paying types of jobs than my parents etc had when they bought ground/a house
To protect yourselves against the vampires in your country I guess
Yeah because making thing with your hand is fun
My parents always need a "goal", often that is renovating something at the house
When we bought the place I think it took like 3 years before our yard was in any decent shape
I've removed wooden planks placed in their yard not 9 months earlier
What I've heard said about Belgian cuisine is the quality of french cuisine with the volume of German cuisine
For me personaly belgian
but my french and german is not good
(because i am from west vlaanderen some flemisch people gona say my flemisch is also not good)
Ps sorry for the bad english
It's all relative
In Belgium, I feel Brusseleir
In Europe, I feel Belgian
In the world, I feel European
I feel Belgian, I never say I'm Flemish, don't like it
But as always with Belgium it's complicated: Feeling Flemish in this day and age often goes supporting the Flemish independance parties NVA en Vlaams Belang
But indeed, when abroad you say Belgium, however a lot of people, especially outside Europe, don't know it sadly enough
Belgian first
Edit: Walloon second
Edit: Is there a joke that i'm not getting
Basically I don’t feel Belgian or Flemish
I’m West Flemish and I’m proud of it
Personally I have no feeling with any other part in Belgium
We have the sea, nature, the best dialect in the world and the prettiest city in Belgium
The only thing we don’t have is a university, and that’s why West Flemish people are colonising Ghent
I guess Belgian, then Flemish, but that doesn’t mean I feel any affinity with Wallonia
I'd say I'm a European first and foremost
Second I'm Belgian
Even though I don't agree on a political level with my fellow countrymen, they are my countrymen and we share a great deal
There is a divide in some way
I personally feel more attracted to being Flemish
Reason being that the Belgian part has trouble getting a goverment together
Don't get me wrong I would love to feel proud to be Belgian, and I have no issue with the people of Wallonia
I just wish our politicians could keep the country together instead of ripping it apart
I feel Belgian
I feel very belgian, but Wallonia is a place with grumpy, unemployed people
For flemish people they mostly feel more flemish but for walloon people they feel more Belgian I think
I'm a bit of an odd one, because I feel Brabantian* (being born in a town of Brussels and grew up in walloon Brabant, all formerly part of the Duchy of Brabant) and Belgian, then Beneluxian, and then Indo-European
**Wallonia and Flanders are modern constructs, that really took shape in the 20th century
I'd say Belgian from Flanders
Honestly I like to identify myself as a citizen of the European Union more than anything
But if I had to choose between Belgian and Flemish, than I'm more proud to be Belgian than Flemish
I think this is because I don't like what's associated (mainly by me) with Flanders, look at a map of the last elections for example
The same goes for Belgium compared to the EU, mainly the whole government thing we got going
Whereas Europe does so many great things to improve our daily lives
The controversies the EU does get involved in, I can somewhat stand behind
I also feel like the EU connects many people and it certainly creates a lot of opportunities, that a small country like Belgium just can't accomplish on its own
For me, it's in this order:
European
Flemish
Belgian
I’ll be honest: Wallonia feels like a completely different country and I feel more Flemish than Belgian
But this is different for every person, obviously
I feel more Flemish than Belgian
I don't feel like we should split the country and I don't hate the walloons
But it's safe to say that the inner workings of Belgium don't enhance the feeling of nationalism alot
It's Flemish or vanish
From personal experience: I‘m pretty sure the Flemish feel more proud to be a Fleming and would therefore call themselves Flemish rather than Belgian a lot of the time (but of course not always/not everyone
), while the Walloons tend to just call themselves Belgian
One could argue that this is reflected in the different political viewpoints from the north vs the south
Me personally, I would probably say “A Belgian from Flanders” if someone would ask me where I’m from :)
Ah yes totally easy to explain /s. Sometimes I feel Flemish, other times I feel Belgian
Usually Flemish within Belgium, Belgian when abroad
It’s a weird identify crisis to have sometimes
I’ve partially grown up in Brussels so I can’t really relate to some things like Flemish student culture, so it’s confusing
I’m also a Flemish person dating someone from Wallonia, so together it feels like we’re just Belgians with regional differences
I feel more connected to other Belgians mentality wise than lets say average Dutch or French people
I feel more flemish then Belgian because they’re are totally different because of the Walloons
Belgium also feels like 2 countries in one so yeah
Sorry for bad English
Definitly more so Flemish than Belgian
Outside of sports or trying to explain to someone from a far away country where youre from, you wont see much "Belgian". We are divided in pretty much everything
TV, news, language, political parties, how we vote even
Again a very long time without a government, goes to show Belgium is definitly a failed experiment imo
I feel more foreign in Wallonia than in the Netherlands tbh
There is no real feeling of "Belgian identity" or national unity, although some really would like (to believe) that
Belgium is disgusting
A ceremonial democracy under a totalitarian kingdom
A kingdom of the descendants of Leopold, who literally slaughtered more people than the Nazis
I feel the same when visiting the francophone part of Belgium
Toen moej ma up undr mulle klopn
Das volk dat op ons neer kijkt omdat het West-Vlaams spreekt
I don't know if there are a lot like me, but I feel as much Belgian as Flemish as European
Although if I'm in another country, I would say I'm from Belgium and not mention Flanders
But Wallonia still feels like another country
Same in reverse from Wallonia
I identify as Belgian, not Walloon, but Flanders feels more foreign than, say, the North of France
Same same
> But as always with Belgium it's complicated: Feeling Flemish in this day and age often goes supporting the Flemish independance parties NVA en Vlaams Belang
It's one of those shades of grey that's disappearing in today's hyperpartisan world of politics: people are expected to be either proud Belgians or Flemings
As if you can't be both
Yeah, I mostly see myself as Flemish, but I don't support Flemish independance
I just don't have any "link" with wallonia
America second
Brabantian here, Brabant forever
since I'm from the east of brabant I do feel a certain connection with our Limburgian friends (hell even Dutch Limburg feels like it isn't a different country) and Liège is chill too, but the 2 flemish provinces feel as foreign as Hainaut
Brabant first, Belgian second, European third
> Dunkerque
Rightful Belgian clay
En ne stamp in under klootn
En ze doen verzeekers allemaal drugs
drugs
druuuugs
Beautiful
That's basically it
Brussels isn't that big of a city
Actually for me it goes 2 steps deeper: Village - Community - Province - Flanders - Belgian - European
Belgium, only to see if my interlocutor knows where it's located
Joke aside, I would answer Belgium, because that's probably the kind of answer the people asking would expect
If I answered "Europe", then he would clearly be asking "which country
" next
If I were in a meeting/party/gathering with several people in the US, most of them Americans, except for one other European, I would probably feel closest to that European, even if he isn't Belgian
That's what I meant by "I feel European".
French
Somehow the fact that a Dutchie knows that dude fills me with pride
Ma wunder zin tit vre goe te verstoan
75% of the people who visit our beaches are probably from the North of France
Shared history, shared culture, shared hatred of the French for stealing our fries and claiming them as their own
The north of the country tends to vote towards the right of the political spectrum, while the south tends to vote towards the left
As a result, our politicians have been trying to form a government since last May
Never seen one in the wild
they don't identify as walloon, but politically are totally aligned to them
They are technically in Wallonia but I'm not sure they identify as Walloon
I think they identify more as their community (German speaking community) rather than their region (Wallonia)
Or they just feel Belgian
This is my guess from a nearby, French speaking city
Too bad nobody in Belgium knows the lyrics
Same, although not often do I really feel "Flemish". I find the differences between the rest of Flanders and Limburg equally big as between here and Wallonia, save for the language
I also easily associate with our Limburgish friends across the border
Maybe that replaces the "Flemish" sentiment for me ?
Te minste jen die vo oenze rechtn ipkomt
the flemish media have broken the cordon sanitaire, and the end result is that division
Damn
Now I feel like I should have tried to say something funny
Too late though
I fully understand your sentiment, I also live in Limburg and often the Flanders part gets skipped and more towards Belgian
But I do not associate myself with the Dutchies that much
Indeed
Was doing a walk from Westende to Dunkerque this summer but we had to stop after 30 mins because the beach got closed because they were doing a military training in Lombardsijde
Still was nice tho
it is common in banks
Straks blijft er niets meer van België en Nederland over en zijn het allemaal kleine nutteloze provincies
Charleroi, ["the ugliest city in the world"]
Just too late
But if you go a little bit further you have one of the nicest places in germany, dortmund
Just no
The club does a lot
Plus a lot of nature as well
The openminded-ness of people really depends on what parts of Brussel you visit
Atleast by night
Expensive-depends where you're coming from
Lets say I have a slightly different opinion of Brussels than you have,wich is perfectly fine to have
I’d say because we offer proper help to people
Are you sick or mentally unstable
Here’s some money from the state to go to a doctor or psychologist
Don’t have a job
Here’s a replacement income from the state
You can’t work for 2 months because of an illness
Here’s an income from the state
Americans are often just left alone, I think that’s why people start acting weird - especially when they already have a mental illness
Universal and cheap social security ?
Article 1
Belgium is a federal state, comprised from the communities and the regions
Following articles are all related to our federal state structure, article 8 through 32 is called "The Belgians and their rights". All other stuff is more boring state-stuff
I feel like the Russian one might need a little update
>It shall be organised on a decentralised basis
I thought France was a very centralised country
None of the regional languages (like Basque or Breton) are official in any of the regions for example
I believe your capital Riga was majority Russian speaking up untill like 15 years ago
The throwing up in Ayahuasca is presented as being part of the cleansing ceremony
Some people only drink juice for five days to cleanse their bodies
Others spend 80 hours a week doing a job they hate
People in general are just weird
Personal preference I guess
As a chronic pain patient I wouldn't mind throwing up every now and then and get less pain in return
Sometimes I really wish I could throw up, but I can't anymore due to surgery
It wouldn't be Dutch if there wasn't at least one middle aged woman with a kortpittig kapsel
Former residents of Doel (near Antwerp next to the largest nuclear power plant in Belgium) who had to be evacuated for the extension of the port
Now the project is canceled but the village has become a ghost town (only few people still live)  and a open-air street art museum
I think that there will be a reconstruction projet
Brussels
It can be such an amazing region but years of bad government have ruined it
I feel sorry for those living in Charleroi, it's getting better recently but it's still in the shadows of their great past during the great industrialization
I also feel sorry for flanders in general as they're currently getting brainwashed by newspapers and various medias  owned by less than good people that aim to make people take a direction to become more xenophobic, vlaams nationalist, etc
Kind of an issue that the cordon sanitaire isn't a thing anymore there and it is slowly transforming a region that was once lovely and tolerant into something that i don't recognize anymore
The South of the country
It's not that it's bad there by any means but there is still a very clear difference in development
And the region of Mol, with a higher than usual leukemia rate because of the nuclear research center
How is the Northeastern part
I feel like I hear much less from them than any other region of Turkey
That after WW2 Belgium was on the brink of a civil war about if our king (Leopold III) was allowed back or not (he lived in excile during WW2)
This lead to terrorist attacks, strikes and marches
For a period Wallonia was on the verge of declaring independence
It’s called the Royal Question
Edit: typo’s.
That in 1789 the Austrian-Netherlands had a revolution and formed the United States of Belgium, but the Austrians crused the revolution in 1790 and the Austrian-Netherlands were reestablished up until the Napoleonic wars
The battle of the golden spurs
Its about the only time in history that Belgium did something even remotely interesting
And ofc Ceasar calling us the bravest of all gauls but that's pretty well known I think
Don't want to be that guy, but it's called the 'Royal Question' in English, Question royale in French and Koningskwestie in Dutch
>For a period Wallonia was on the verge of declaring independence
How the turntables turn
Thought the wiki was kings question
My bad
That's okay
So much that they restored the English monarchy
drinking beer in a glass not designed for beer
makes me die inside whenever my father does it, but he comes from a country where beer isn't really a part of the culture so i let it slip
Not ordering a drink when going to a restaurant
I don't really like paying €2
5 or more for a 75cl bottle of soda knowing I can buy a 1
5l bottle of the same drink at the store across the street for less than half the price once the meal is over
Saying "no" when the waiter asks what to drink feels illegal though because the restaurant obviously makes a lot of their profit from it and it's just something people never do
people actually care about that shit
lmao
i eat a little bit of sugary stuff every day, and have always done so, and my dentist says my teeth are good
i hardly brush them every day
Same for beer in the wrong glass here
Please, explain
Or drinking a certain beer in a glass of another beer
Yea, the drinks are what brings in the cash
Not the food generally
I take out my pillbox when I ask for a glass of tap water, even when I don't really need to take any meds at that specific time
I usually have to take meds before eating anyway, but still, even if for some reason I don't I'd still take the box out as if to say
'You understand, right
' Makes me feel even more guilty, but on the other hand
got so much crap going on in my life I can't even leave the house without a giant pillbox and adult diapers in my handbag, so just get me some damn tap water, I don't want to pay for fucking Vitel
if they look chill i guess
i have talked to shitloads of strangers on the streets but i have never hit on girls in that way so idk xD
my father went to the US and he told me that when the waiters see your glass is empty, they refill it with water without asking
he found that epic
It's more about the correct shape/type of glass than the specific brand though
Some beer types need some glass types
Such as : chalice, pils glass, tulip, snifter, etc
So meeting up for just sex is fine but going on a movie date and then having sex is not
Seems like a great way to teach young people about healthy relationships
Yeah, exactly
I've been avoiding buying certain beers I like recently, because I recently moved house and the matching glasses are still wrapped up in the loft
I might be a relatively extreme case, though
In Flanders, were it not from Standard (Belgian) Dutch or tussentaal, you wouldn't understand someone speaking in a town 1 province over
So in the 19th-20th century people started trying this new standard language, couldn't really do it, and got stuck somewhere inbetween dialect and standard
That language is tussentaal, and it has the features that it lacks interesting local vocabulary or grammatical forms, and is still too unintelligable for a Dutch speaker from for example the Netherlands
The worst from two worlds essetially
In dutch words can have multiple meanings
For example: the word weg can mean both road and gone, depending on the context
I study ancient Greek in high school, and it had that too
It's pretty rare, so when encountered we're firsted completely weirded out, then, somewhat annoyed, be like "it's dualis isn't it
". It can really throw you off
Ah I wanted to say gezellig haha
And I love it
I'm pretty sure a lot of languages have that
Scots is way closer to other Getmanic languages than English
Whenever I hear it, I'm surprised how much I can understand because I speak Dutch
A lot of words are very similar, whereas these are replaced with French ones in English
I don't think they do this anymore, but if they used it in ancient texts, it usually was meant to lay extra emphasis on the fact that it was 2
It can sometims be an important piece of information to understand the text
Hello,
Here in Belgium we have to choose from age 12, but in most schools Greek can only be learned from age 13, in second year, or even later than that
Greek is a rather niche study path, only available in aso, probably comparable to your liceo
In my school we have \~12-20 Greek students per year, and I'm quite comfortable saying that that's quite high in comparisson to other schools
In Belgium there usually aren't special schools for specific fields, like a school for math, one for sciences; instead all fields are usually in one school, but you can still choose, for example, humanities, economics, sciences, latin, greek, math, usually making a combination of 2 directions (5^(th) & 6^(th) year)
>In fact, it is so commonly used that some words, like „Mädchen“ (girl) have become standard
It's the same in Dutch: 'meisje'
basically yes, but because it's a suffix in a word it's more subtle and easier to gloss over
No way in hell I'm going to pick summer time
Even winter time is off by one hour of what our "natural hour" is supposed to be
While summer time means more light in the afternoon in the summer, it also means dark as fuck all morning in winter while everyone is on their way to work and children are walking to school
No amount of fun summer evenings can ever justify the immense dangers it would entail
Overall I'd say summer time, but for Western Europe this doesn't make sense
We should be the same time zone as the UK, but we aren't because of a relic of WWII
Thus I'd say we must be GMT + 1 (UK summer time but Central European wintet time)
Winter time is biologically more correct but at this point I dont care which: just pick one and stop this fucking change twice per year
Whichever they want as long as they fucking stick to it
For all I care they reverse the fucking clock
How about a middle road solution and move the clock forward/backward half an hour
Many scientists from various disciplines have advocated for this solution, as it mitigates the harmful effects of both summer time and winter time
It's not a perfect solution, but arguably a better one than keeping either time, let alone the current system
There is a significant spike in heart attacks, insomnia and other problems each time the clocks are put an hour forwards/backwards
Was going to say this
But it's more a typical Belgian solution : compromise
I'm arguing for the safety of these people on their way to work and children
Natural light is very important to keep alert and awake, while also granting a better vision than in the dark
If we go to UTC+2 in winter the sun won't rise until 10am
We’re the country with the most castles per square kilometer in the world
Also, Brussels International Airport is the location where the most chocolate is sold worldwide
Edit: rephrased my 2nd fact
So that means you killed them
>Prison escape is not punishable by law in Germany
I think it's the same here
>Prison escape is not punishable by law in Germany
Belgium too, but if you don't mail back your jumpsuit it will be considered stolen, which IS a crime
This is absolutely amazing
I believe we were the second country to legalize it
Wales has 600 castles in 20735 km^2, which is 1 castle every 34
56 km^2
Belgium has 3000 castles in 30689 km^2, which is 1 castle every 10
23 km^2
Sooo Wales is lying
[You were having the party of the century lol]
Belief me there is no dog meat in frikandel, i think there is not even meat in it
That is a majestic castle
I’ve always wanted to do a roadtrip in Wales, the nature + history is so stunning
This is the closest castle to me:
Fun fact about this castle: in 1949 it got sieged by police because students took it over because they were protesting the fact that the price of beer was going to get raised
Edit: too much god damn typo’s.
Is there a difference between an english castle and a chateau
Isn't it the other way around
Students took it over and the police was besieging them
ah yes, students and their undying love for beets
Oh right, just made a typo
I’ll change it
This post has been one shitshow in regards to typos
My bad
Oh well Belgium is especially full of those
This is mainly due to Flanders being the richest region north of the Alps during the 12th-16th century
Cities as Bruges, Ghent, Ypres and Antwerp were the European heart of trade where all different types of products (wood from Scandinavia, wool from England, stuff from Russia, etc
) were traded and made
Because of this we had a lot of rich folks that build castles for themselves
haha no don't worry, made my day :)
And if I'm not mistaken, the rise of the beer price was not the only thing the students were protesting against
Normally, police uniforms had white hats which made them very easy to spot
They were planning to change the hats / helmets to blue, which made it easier to blend in a crowd and more difficult to see from a distance
Students weren't so fond of this change
Yes you’re correct
Antwerp
Trying to drive a car in GTA with that amount of traffic would be hella funny
Paris, it’s as beautiful as it is dirty and dangerous
I feel like people outside of Europe have a very romanticized view on most EU cities, so it would be interesting to see them portrayed as they actually are; like any major city
Breaking news, local crackhead stuck in traffic on ring
Mayor: ladies and gentlemen, we got 'em
I'd love to play sidemissions for an idiot Filip Dewinter parody
Can you imagine the social commentary you could include if there was an idiot militant Vlaams Belang like faction in vein of the border patrol sidemission guys from GTAV
Putting the 4 freedoms to good use
“Follow the damn muslim filip”
Also the temper of the locals
You don't need a satnav, you need a sherpa
Mine just starts screaming when they find out we’re driving via Antwerp
Manneken Pis, def
I saw it once and was very disappointed
It's not much
It's just a small statue thats "peeing". And it's really small, you can barely see it because of all the people there :')
Manneken Pis for sure
I would say Manneken Pis probably, because one: it will likely be crowded by tourists and two: it's really not that impressive
Go see the lion of Waterloo instead or maybe the statue of Ambiorix in Tongeren
There used to be a TV show that followed Belgian consulates and embassies around the world
The majority of the consulate in Barcelona's workload was replacing stolen passports
In your opinion, what **would** be an amazing place for tourists to go to, which people don't necessarily know of
Loch Ness is amazing because of Fort Augustus for me
I wouldn’t take a boat tour, eather stay in the little town
Edinburgh Castle is amazing and probably the must see in Edinburgh if you’re into history
Been to Edinburgh twice and I always spend around 4-5 hours there
Can you recommend some other less crowded hikes in Norway
Totally offtopic, but as a vampire obsessed person I love your username
I wouldn't call this a tourist trap as you don't need to pay to see it
It's just extremely boring
I still don't understand why all the tourists want to see a small, boring statue
I love the thermal baths in Budapest
Ahh, I misunderstood the words "tourist trap" then :P
Thank you
I collect beer glasses and Smurf figurines and my fridge is pretty much filled with mayo based sauces and beer
I don’t like beer
Though I recently learned to appreciate fries so I’m getting better at belgianing
I’ve also always loved chocolate so that was right from the start
(I’m on mobile and I can’t make it do the fancy flag flair, or I don’t know how, sorry
I live in a small apartment in Brussels filled to the brim with comic books, I own a mini fridge (next to my regular fridge) mostly containing beer, I know a lot of jokes about French people, I have absolutely no idea how my country's political system is still holding up and I'd say I have a pretty good sense of self-mockery
On the other hand, my Dutch is pretty bad and I don't say "une fois" (but to be fair, no one actually does)
I absolutely love our beer and fries
On the other han I'm not really into the football or sport cycling/cyclocross scene, though
I don't have a beer glass collection
Seventy isn't a collection yet
Yes, I am a dumb asocial cunt that drinks a lot of beer
Ecxept for the Smurf figurines, entirely same
It isn't even a stereotype because almost every guy i know has mayo and beer in their fridge (women a lot less but still a lot)
How about mussles, stoofvlees and vol-au-vent
And nagging about every little thing (are you a grumpy person)
Do you hate Walloons/ French people in general
How old are you and when did you start enjoying fries
And what do you eat it with
Tintin isn't even the best Belgian comics
Haha, "often 2,5 minutes late" seems a pretty cliché German way to be late, though
Glad I'm not the only one with a dedicated beer fridge
I don't think we have any like that, maybe ask America, they do that sort of thing (still disgusted from Turkey Beer)
I like mussels, don’t like stoofvlees and vol-au-vent (or anything that resembles those type of dishes like hutsepot or waterzooi)
I do enjoy a good complaining session but have nothing against Walloons or French people
Late twenties
I always ate fries but like 10-15 per meal and I’d be done with them
I think I started to really enjoy them about a year ago or something, cause we go to the “frituur” more often and I think I got hooked
I still don’t like home made ones though
I eat them with mayonnaise, or if you meant with what side dishes I eat them then it’s always with some kind of “frituursnack”.
Turning more Belgian
Frituur ones are _nearly_ always the best, should explore a bit with sauces (on the side) and maybe if you're feeling adventerous, have some "Saté kruiden"
Enjoy them fellow Belgian :D
We tend to be portrayed exactly as countries around the world see us
Non-existent
Except for In Bruges, but then again, it just showed Bruges
Belgium doesn't exist in the world of Hollywood, as far as I know
Oh wait, there's Dr
Evil from Austin Powers
Having very little information on the differences between Eastern-European countries the bit of news I did hear over the years was that Slovenia is doing rather well
You've got In Bruges, but I've never really seen that one and that's the only one I'm aware off
I'm not completely sure it's american either
I think that part of the movie was pretty spot on
The Expatriate takes place in Belgium
It’d actually pretty good
This is just the worst scene in it
Don't worry, I'm sure portrayals of Hungary speak a Slavic language often enough
It's all "Eastern-Europe" to them
Anything East of Germany is East-Europe as far as I'm concerned
Also known as "the countries I never learned too much about in history class". More a depiction of my ignorance than anything else
I mean this one seems believable, they got a point about how it'd be easier with demons
This is a thread about conspiracy theories, not a thread about actual cover ups
Stop spreading the myth that Finland is real
Wake up SHEEPLE
It is like "cabin in the woods"
Well, hardcore nationalists/extreme rightwingers will see a downside to this
Well, germany supposedly has the most power and influence in the EU, and could easely take on the leader role, but it doesn’t do that
Because of obvious “historical reasons”. So france, being the second largest power, takes that role on them
I wouldn’t mind if germany takes on more of a leader role and centralises the EU a bit more, it’s been 80 years people get over it
'a' is only used in typing
α is used in writing, often in cursive
The same goes for open tail 'g', looptail 'g' and the handwritten 'g'.
The first two are in general only used for typing, while most write the cursive 'g' with a loop
Ok so we want Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, Noord Brabant, and Limburg from the Netherlands
And also France is going to have to return Frans Vlaanderen
No pressure guys but we'll invade tomorrow after lunch
i don't like this posts comments, my country will be split up over germany france the netherlands and luxembourg
I believe a few years ago the wikipedia page of San Marino was "locked" on the night of the contest because they were afraid Italians would deface it if they didn't get their twelve points
Joke's on you, our highest hill is just a couple of meters short of being a mountain
Not even including [Rockall] tssk
Next time
Might have to wait for a long time while while we try to form the current one
I know a lot and it is all from the internet: You Tube, Radio free Europe
The Belgian media just doesn't want to cover these topics until it becomes very big
They only care about the US, France, Germany, UK and the Netherlands
In Belgium it is not the top story, but it is covered
Although most people don't really know the exact situation in Belarus
Personally I wholeheartedly support the pro democracy movement, just hoping that it doesn't come to a bloodshed
Even if Lukashenko has a majority it is still unhealthy for a country to have the same man in charge for all these years
But right know he just oppresses the opposition and changes the results of the election for his personal gain
[Physical confrontations between Belarusian police and protesters about controversial election results
I hope it gets the same results as Ukraine's Maidan revolution, but that's probably out of reach
Right now they're classified as "election night clashes", I think it'll stay that way tbh I've grown cynical
I would really like to see them gain a more pro-EU stance and government
Less corruption and more international unity is what we need
I saw some guy walking on the street getting kidnapped by government officials in a white van on the news
Scary stuff man
Last night's evening new did cover the elections
However at that time they only covered that it's happening and that it overt supporters of the opposition can get picked off the streets for protesting
Yeah but there was so much to tell before the election
It will probably come back in the news today now that the protests are escalating
Supersizing food or drinks
There are so many:
\-VAT added at the check-out
As a customer I don't give a shit about what the original price of something was, I only care about how much money **I** am going to spend on it
\-Flags, American flags everywhere
I can get it if you're an immigrant and hanging your original country's flag (maybe with an American flag next to it) outside your house to show you're both
Just American flags is more difficult to get for me
When I see an American flag hanging outside of a house in the US, all I can think is 'Duuhhh, this is the US, of course you're American
" But maybe if I stretch my brains and try to understand what it is to be so patriotic, I might sort of, kind of, a tiny little bit understand
What I can't understand is why a car dealership who sells a foreign brand (e.g. Japanese cars) would put 2-3 massive poles with massive American flags in front of their company
If you sold only US brand, I might get it as advertising that you are so homecountry loving
But they sell Japanese cars, why do you need 2-3 massive American flags out front
I just don't understand, this is not someone that found a flag on their attic and though "you know what, I'll put it in front of the company for some extra decoration
" No someone actually had to justify using a decent bit of budget to buy massive poles, massive flags and labor cost to drill holes into the ground, probably get some kind of crane (I doubt the poles could have been put there just by manual strenght) to put the poles into place
Actual budget and thought must have gone into deciding that this was necessary for the company, for some reason
\-Eating (fast food) in your cars
I'm not talking about being in a hurry, go through a drive through and eat on your way to work/...No I'm talking about going through a drive through, then park in the parking lot of that fast food chain and eating in your car
How is that more convenient than going inside, using an actual table and not risking making your car dirty
(I'm sure this doesn't apply to all Americans, but I knew someone who did this and I've seen others do it too
So I'm sure it's not a complete unusual thing
\-Tipping
I understand that it's a nice thing to leave a little tip when service was great
But I don't understand why it's not required to pay waiters at least minimum wage and why the customer has to carry the burden of making sure that these people can earn a living
Also tipping hair dressers, if I'm just cutting my hair
Am I just paying for two pumps of shampoo, a bit of water and wear and tear on the comb and scissors
In Belgium when I pay for a hair dresser, I always assume that the majority of the cost is actually the labor cost, so I don't get why that would be reduced to 'a tip'.
\-Drinking age: Do we really expect people who are considered to be adults and people who are going through college/university, to really not drink any alcohol
\-All the beeping on TV
If you beep out a swear word, you're actually attracting more attention to it
If someone responds "That's fucking GREAT
" I might have barely noticed that a swear word was used, but if it is "Thats BEEEEEEPP GREAT" Yeah I definitely noticed that a swear word was used
Also changed songs where they took out swear words are weird to me
In Belgium they're not beeped out
It happened multiple times that I knew a song (unscensored) from the radio in Belgium and then suddenly I heard the song somewhere in some American media and it's either beeped out or the lyrics were changed
Like 'Fuck you' from Cee Lo Green, the first time I heard 'Forget you' somewhere, I was really confused
Or all the silent pauzes were so disturbing the first time I heard the cleaned up version of 'Fuck It' form Eamon
\-The Pledge of Allegiance in schools
WTH, that to me seems like complete brainwashing
I could maybe understand starting the day with singing the national anthem and even that I would probably find exaggerated
But having kids vow and making a promise  they probably don't even understand
Pledging allegiance to a nation UNDER GOD at an age they probably never even took the time to deeply think it thought if they actually believe in a God or not or if they do, which God(s) they believe in
I've read it's not mandatory and you can refuse it
But kids will generally go along with what they've been told even if they haven't thought it through what it means
To me it always seemed creepy
The image of a totalitarian country brainwashing it's citizens since childhood
\-Gaps in stalls of public toilets
I have no issues with gasps on the bottom or top, but on the side
Why bother putting doors at all if the gaps are sometimes so huge you easily see everything inside completely by accident
\-A backer's dozen
Though I quite like this one, I find it quite charmingly sounding actually
\-The US customary system (a.k.a. US Imperial system), yup as a metric system user it confuses me
\-US money (coins and bills)  I'm used to euros where the bills have different sizes and different colors
A quick glance into my wallet gives an immediate idea of how much money I have
In the US the bills are all the same size and all grey-greenish
If you look in your wallet and see around 10 notes, you have no clue if you have 10 dollars or 230 dollars
Also the coins are annoying, but I think this mainly just applies to tourists, people new in the US
Certain coins do not mention how much they're worth in numbers
As someone new to US coins it might be difficult to learn by heart in the beginning that 1 dime = 0,10 dollar and it's no help whatsoever if the coin itself just says 'ONE DIME'. Also it confused the hell out of me that 0,10 dollars (dime) is a way smaller coin than 0,05 dollars (nickel)
\-Not drinking alcohol in public
When I was in Florida somewhere, every Thrusday evening there was a musical event close to a beach
There was a little wooden gazebo with enough space for a band and some chairs
Most people sat around the gazebo in their own beach chairs
It was a nice event, mainly attended by people 50+, but also some younger people and children
It always seemed so weird that at a time like that people had to hide that they were drinking a beer
Also what's with the paper bag
By now drinking something out of a paper bag should probably be synonymous with drinking alcohol right
There's probably much more that I can't think of right now
&#x200B;
Edit: I just thought of another one: fixed shower heads
I can only speak from my experience in some homes/hotels/motels in Florida but I've heard it once or twice from other people who went somewhere else in the US
I don't understand why they have fixed shower heads and not ones you can choose to put in a holder or choose to take in your hand
How can you decently rinse anything below your waist without doing a handstand
(Or is that the secret American way of showering
:p )
4 way stops
"My great great grandparents best friend was irish so im irish" while probably not even knowing where eorope os located
How they are all so fat and everything needs to be massive
I think it's a combination of habit and cost
At least for the average Joe, I think if you've used miles and gallons and lbs (what's up with that abbreviation btw) your entire life, you won't easily switch over to another one
18 years ago, the euro was introduced in Belgium
Whenever my dad talks about about buying a car or a house or anything that costs quite a bit, he talks about the price in Belgian franks (and then I have to convert to understand wth he's talking about)
He's not the only one, I've heard many people over the age of 50, who still regularly mention prices in Belgian Franks
Habits are difficult to change
And with things like measurements and amounts there's this thing of instinctively knowing how much something is
I know that 1ft is around 30cm, but when I watch an American show/movie and they're talking about "And it was 15 feet high
" I have no immediate (instinctive) grasp on how high that is
I need to pauze the video to think about it, calculate it etc
So for people who have used the imperial system their entire lives, I'm sure in every day life they're not eager to change
&#x200B;
Also changing everything would be a huge cost
How much exactly, no one knows
Things like street signs need to be changed (I was shocked when I once read about how costly street signs actually are), labels need to be changed on every product, scales need to be changed, a lot of educational things need to be changed (like text books, rulers, maybe certain posters on classroom walls etc) and many many things I can't even come up with
It would cost billions of US dollars I am sure
Then again I also read that the US loses a lot of money from not changing to metric because of extra calculations and calculation mistakes that happen (e.g. in international trade etc)
I think in the long run there's no doubt that changing to metric is the best option
But I think the problems lie in the short run, high short term costs and issues with the average Americans adapting in their day to day lives
Imagine my disappointment when I went to a dollar store for the first time in my life
I was standing at the check out, with my dollar in my hand, ready to give it to the employee and suddenly she says: That'll be $1,06" o\_0
I strongly concur with that
Americans are insanely bad at classifying people from different ethnic groups (I'm generalizing of course, but even the US Census Bureau uses some pretty simplistic racial categories)
"Black/Brown/White", all those are just superficial categorizations that are not truly representative of the difference between ethnic groups, a dark-skin Caribbean, a West-African, and an Afro-American would all fall under the same category : "Black"
A Slav, a North African, a caucasian European, and a "White American" would fall under the same category too : "White"
And this "white" ethnical categorization just means that everyone who's "light-skin" belongs to the same ethnicity, which is factually wrong
And what I personally hate the most is the term "person of color".
Who tf falls under that category anyway
Everyone who's not ethnically caucasian
Then that's so fucking broad, it literally makes no sense to put people from drastically different cultures, ethnic groups, and backgrounds into one single superficial category
What about people from non-western cultures that are ethnically "light-skin"? (Persians, North Africans, Slavs, etc
It's just pure nonsense
>Letting private companies run things the state should do
(Like prisons)
I saw a documentary that even exposed privatization in the foster care/social work system
The country is doomed
>No need to obsess over it
That's because those who obsess over it don't actually know what it is and could not even tell you the tenets if you asked them to
I didn't know that about the money
Did they change it quite recently and is it already quite usual to see these everywhere or not
The last time I was in the US was 3-4 years ago (in Florida), all the bills I got in my hand back then were the green-gray ones
(Though I doubt I ever had a $100 in my hand)
I didn't know that, never been to Norway, I hope one day I'll visit it
Nice picture, seems like a nice area to live
I have no idea what you are trying to say
You could argue that they've gotten more "westernized" for the past few decades after the fall of the USSR and the foundation of the European Union, but no, any country that was east of the iron curtain during the cold war wouldn't be considered as "Western".
Western countries include mostly Western Europe (including the nordic countries), North America (United States and Canada), without forgetting Australia and New Zealand
Interesting
I know what you mean, in Dutch we call it 'wimpel', I'm also not sure what the English word is
Strangely enough Wikipedia doesn't have it
I did find the word 'pennant'. But it doesn't get the same results in Google Images as 'vimpel' or 'wimpel'. It looks like pennants way shorter and are mainly used for sports teams or universities
Well of course not, Communism emerged in Gemany which is definitely a western country
But I think when you look at both recent and Ancient history, there are commonalities between Western nations :
-This western/eastern divide in Europe could be traced back to the theological separation between Western Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Europe
-Western countries of course get a lot of inspiration and are heavily-influenced in their culture from ancient civilizations such as the Roman empire or ancient Greece
Things like political philosophy, science, architecture were impacted a lot by the Greeks, and Ancient Rome of course gave us many other elements such as urban engineering, the rule of law, governance, and republicanism
And believe it or not, but it was also greatly expanded later on during the Islamic Golden Age from the imported Arab contributions in medieval Europe (after the dark ages), such as innovations in literature, astronomy, mathematics, and medicine
Without forgetting all of the imported innovations via the silk road (chinese inventions like paper or gunpowder)
-More recently, you could argue that after the Renaissance, the Enlightenment era shaped what would be considered the modern-day definition of the "West", with new ideologies and philosophies such as liberalism, reductionism, egalitarianism, and rationalism
-In modern western societies, there are some defining tendencies at the societal level that could broadly  define what a western country is : Democracy (or political pluralism in general), secularism (although Americans are definetly less secular in quite a few aspects that the rest of the western world), individual liberties and civil rights (not saying that non-western countries aren't free, just saying that it's a common characteristic within the western world that emerged during the Enlightenment), capitalism/free-market economy (especially after the industrial revolution)
At least that's how I personally see it, but then again this is very broad and extremely subjective, so take it with a grain of salt ;)
>we have like 300 in about 3 weeks
We have 300 deaths per day
Everything you just cited applies to countries like Poland, Czechia or Slovenia
This clear East-West division in Europe is something that definitely stems from the Cold War
Oh yea definetly
As mentionned previously, most eastern European countries got westernized in quite a few aspects since the fall of the USSR and the foundation of the European Union, without forgetting the expansion of NATO
No, they were already "western" way before WW II
Copernicus, one of the key figures of the scientific revolution, was from Poland
Poland was Catholic before the Nordic countries were even christianised
Jan Hus, a Czech Theologian, was already preaching the reformation of the Roman Catholic Church before Martin Luther was even born
The kingdom of Bohemia (present day Czechia) became part of the Holy Roman Empire when vikings were still going on raids
Slovenia on the other hand has been deeply influenced by Austria and Italy for centuries and experienced the Renaissance earlier than many other parts of Europe
Dads get 15 working days paid paternity leave
Moms get 15 weeks
Ours just said to go get it but stay "on the clock", so no paid day off but however long we stay out counts towards a full workday as usual
We do also get a paid day for one day of volunteering at a local health facility involving Covid
But then my dad and his coworkers at the local commune discovered you could donate plasma once a month
Wasn't sure anymore
I know they went once a month because that was their maximum of getting an extra day of
I'm biased but I feel like Mechelen is quite underrated, with its rich history, many beautiful monuments and four UNESCO mentions
The school in the nearby village of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Waver (where I grew up) is also a hidden gem
If bigger cities I would say Bruges
Otherwise you can probably find a few well preserved little towns as well
I spend a lovely day and night in Bamberg
I was on a holiday in Slovenia with my girlfriend, we were planning on staying a few might here or there, nothing booked and just see where we'll get
We only had a tough schedule planned out
We were in the Alpine region of Slovenia (lovely region
) for two nights when the weather prediction predicted lots and lots of rain and thunderstorms
So we just said "let's go to where the sun is shining". Looking at weather predictions from all over Europe it was only northern/eastern Germany so we decided to go towards Dresden
We decided to do the trip in 2 days to take it easy
So we were looking for a place to sleep somewhere (on a camping) and my girlfriend saw the name Bamberg, thought is sounded cute and so we decided to stay the night in the area
We were very pleasantly surprised by the city, of which we had no knowledge before
Beautiful city centre, lovely architecture (of which you don't find much due to WW2) of the medieval period and we had a blast there
I finished my Erasmus in Budapest with a stay at the Balaton lake and we visited Tihany, it was so beautiful
In Flemish (and also in Dutch, even in the official "Algemeen Nederlands") the word "slim" means something like "smart, wise, keen".
In English it means "thin".
English : eventually
French : éventuellement
The English is more like a final status, when the French one is more a hypothetical event
Interesting fact, "Fee" in English has the same origin as "Vieh" in German (sounds more or less the same to me), where it retained it's original meaning of cattle or livestock
Cattle was often used as currency in the past, hence the meaning changed to mean "payment".
Lol, "kaka" in Flemish Dutch at least means "shit/feces" I wouldn't wanna eat a cake that is called "kaka" in Sweden lmao
When I asked Germans if they knew/understood the word Nachtmahr, they said they didn't. Isn't it a specifically Austrian term for it ?
Also in French, "une glace" is an icecream
Yup, same in French, but with C's.
used pretty frequently in that context here below the border
bijkomen is more like when someone passed out and wakes up (or when someone gains weight)
Flemish here: we hear more news about the US and the UK than The Netherlands or France, they come at a close third though
How we feel about it
Considering the Netherlands gives (mostly) boring news and France only news from Northern France, it isn't a big issue at all
Would like less new about nr 1 and 2 though
Nah not really
And I wouldnt really mind either: I love both The Netherlands and France
Belgium is tiny and just not such a big player on a world scale
Im fine with that
I learned we had reached an agreement for a federal government through a french online newspaper
Well, I sure wish we had less news about France, and more news about the Netherlands and Germany as well
Or even better, more news about Flanders too
Idk about Wallonia but there really isn’t much French or Dutch news in Flanders
Most of it is Flemish/Belgian news, European or international
I actually hear very little of the Netherlands on the other side of the language border
Try watching zondag met Lubach
Fun way to get into Dutch current news
I don't know if I can say with a straight face that we're *well* informed about the Netherlands, but regardless, I do agree that they do not dominate our news cycle
Yeah also, it doesn't seem like many Flemings watch Dutch tv at all, whereas Walloon apparently watch a lot of French tv
Totally agree
Sadly, our Flemish news reports very little about Wallonia, with the result that the only things Flemish people know about Wallonnia consists of outdated stereotypes
Oh no, don't get me wrong, I don't see it as a bad thing at all
It's just that it doesn't matter much to see much news from the Netherlands because of that reason, as there isn't much to tell anyway
Well, don't get me wrong, it's still boring, but the shitty kind of boring
Temptation Island, Expeditie Robinson etc
Mixed results really, but that has nothing to do with wether there are Dutch people in it
Although there is always a lost famous Dutch person in most Flemish programs
Makes sense, news from Northern France is somewhat relevant to us, and news from Belgium is somewhat relevant for Northern France
It is definitely a good thing :)
It's alright, you are now part of the boring neighbours
Rejoice
Instead of just adding "Portugal", try adding "site:.pt". This ensures that all suggestions will be from Portuguese sites instead of Brazilian ones
There are separate organisations taking care of public television and radio channels, yes
Flanders has the VRT (*Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie*), and Wallonia has the RTBF (*Radio-télévision belge de la Communauté française*)
The main channels (*één* and *RTBF 1*, respectively) are available nationally, though
We need a small Benelux news portion in the same vein as sports and weather
Would be rather cool
It's an oversymplification to say we are culturaly that different
We all have the same passion for beer, have the same bourgondian lifestyle and the 'aleise' mentality
The biggest difference is the political landscape and language, but a single fleming and a single walloon have a lot in common
You'll find that the world's greatest beer makes for a pretty potent unifying force
(Partially joking :p )
We do have the Belgian Red Devils, our national football team
I've never seen so many Belgian flags and general proudness of our country when they played for the World Cup
It's in those moment we unite
(With beer ofcourse
I can't find it on my Flemish digital television, but it might be available in Wallonia
(By the way, I apologize to my German community fellow countrymen for overlooking them
It is though
riots in the Netherlands, France or Germany would affect my life in Belgium more than riots in the US
Same goes for police violence, politics, shootings or whatever other news I get from the US would be have a much bigger impact on my life if they would happen in one of our neighbouring countries
I mean, I don't listen to radio or watch television so I consume little Belgium news myself :p.
Big stories I'll hear on /r/belgium
Like we have a government now
No idea what parties are involved with it, I just know the right wingers are mad so that's good I guess
>No idea what parties are involved with it, I just know the right wingers are mad so that's good I guess
Good and bad to be honest
Good that we have one and that we avoided going too right
Bad that if this government doesn't do great we will definitely have a rightwing government next term
First of all, I never said that the US isn't relevant at all
But the actions of the Netherlands, France and Germany do in fact have more effect on the average Belgian
Why
2 of thel are the most influential countries of the EU, the Netherlands and Belgium have close bonds with eachother and our police often need to work together
The same goes for France
What happens there affect the *daily* life of the Belgians
The two last things you mentioneda doesn't affect the average Belgian at all nor does sanctioning certain countries, at least not noticable
And the US companies sure are important, but that is not US politics, Facebook only comes in the news because *Europe* will sanction it if they do not obey our laws
I'd worry more about the Chinese when it comes to tech
And even then, all things you just said are major issues, afcpurse those are important
But just another mass shooting, riot or scandal in the US will affect me way less than if it would happen in my neighbouring countries
Which happens to be exactly what our news is oversaturated with
Not
But for most people every government does bad so it's not even that imo
They could do great and propaganda and uninformed people will still think they did a bad job regardless
I just accept that after a while the right will get in power until they fuck it up badly enough for the left to get off their ass
>I just accept that after a while the right will get in power until they fuck it up badly enough for the left to get off their ass
That is the only reason I was hoping that they'd break Cordon Sanitaire this time arround, so people would see VB isn't the answer
Yes, but that's the thing our news is oversaturated by domestic issues from the US
Obviously we don't complain about relevant news
It's a toss-up between Sweden and Spain
I'm pretty sure I could learn either's language pretty quickly, if I needed to
I'm fine where I am
I'd love to live in Italy and my Italian is good enough for that but the economical situation over there is unfortunately way too dire atm and there's no short/medium term improvement in sight :(
I'm happy to live in Belgium so I have no desire to live in another country
I like it here
Other than the weird political landscape I wouldn't really feel happier somewhere else I think
I think Austria, I just love the mountains
You get to pick one language to speak fluently
Knowledge of the others will either be very broken or non-existant
Thank you for mentioning Flanders
Most people in this thread say the Nethetlands but life in Flanders is basically the same
Except for our roads that are worse, but our food is better imo
That's a very good point you bring up there
Lots of people don't realize what the average population density    is in this part of Europe
I love Austria for a summer holiday but during winter in  the mountains I think we would be up for a shock
Just like everyone else
Germanic with a case system, ***only hardcore
***
Correct
Unfortunately, I barely speak French :(
I fit in better in Sweden, the way my first name is written, no
2: Swedish rolls of the tongue more easily
3: I kinda like living in the EU
Undskyld
An ingenious system of clothing with UV and IR lamps build into it
I grew up mostly in Belgium but I still feel instantly energized and happier when I feel the turkish air and sun around me
Ito seemso too meo ao bito ofo naiveo schemeo
All three of us
I get the same thing but the other way around
I'm Belgian and I don't speak Dutch but a lot of the time, when a fellow Belgian approaches me online, they speak Dutch and then think I'm a foreigner when I say I don't speak Dutch
It's the weirdest thing
Nous sommes la majorité, nom de dieu xD
This is so typical for French people lol
North flanders
In France, when I spoke Dutch with my family, people would occasionally assume we wouldn't understand French, and complain about tourists and their language, after which they would address us in nightmarishly thick English
Always fun to bring up that little irony in French ^^
I had a quite similar experience in London
I was with my cousin in the touristic boat that is cruising over the Thames and we were chatting in Dutch when I hear the French couple in front of us talking about us
The girl whispers to her bf "honey, what language are those two speaking
" and the man to answer "Russian I think". Lol
I didn't correct them, it was just too funny
My stepdad once got approached by another guy selling souvenirs in Egypt
He likes say: oh, another idiot selling me shit here (not the exect words and in dutch)
The guy responded with: you could have just say you're not intrested instead of insulting me (in dutch)
Took a Russian evening class, and just the day before yesterday I went to to buy some shoes
People in front of me were talking in Russian *at least I thought so*. Trying to swap shoes or something
The cashier was trying to explain they didn't have a size shoe anymore but they did at their other store
But since her English was terrible I helped with that
She gave them the address but they didn't know the way
So I politely intervented with an *извините пожалуйста, вы русский, да?*, and gave them directions via *идите налево / направо / направо*. So it was kinda worth it I guess
I speak 4 languages fluently, and a couple others little bits and bobs
I travel often, and yet have not had those gotcha moments :(
I regularly play with the French and Spanish decks because I'm half Belgian, half Spanish
I like to play "La escoba" and "Chinchón".
I also play Koi-koi with some family members using a Japanese hanafuda deck of cards
I'm Moroccan-Belgian, never seen 'em in Belgium but they're definitely insanely popular in Morocco
I feel like it's a Mediterranean thing 'cause they're also widely popular in Italy, Croatia, etc
I didn't even know that existed
I'd also never heard if the 'French deck' because I just thought that was the 'normal deck'. So no, I'm pretty sure this is unknown here
Never seen that
TIL there's a Spanish deck of cards
**yes**
When I just had my license for like 2 weeks or so, I almost had a car crash because some 85y old man (at least he looked that old) started driving against traffic
Very scary experience, especially since it was one of the first times I was driving alone
Have been in favour of a driving test for the elder people ever since
The environment would definitly benefit from it
Yes, definitely
Here in Belgium the most dangerous drivers I've driven past/alongside are elderly people "with no time".
Depends when
Fall just started and it was 11°C today
I was cold the whole day
In 2 weeks, 11°C will feel normal again and 0°C will feel cold
Depens on the wind as well
0°C is okay when there's no cold wind
10°C with a cold wind feels like it's freezing
A good jacket
I'd guess that would be when it drops below 5°C if it's not just for going outside and tossing something in a dumpster
I don't really have a specialized cold-weather jacket though so that's something to keep in mind
A good jacket probably only when the temperature dips below 10°C. As long as it's at 15°C or slightly below, a pullover and a summer jacket will do
Also interesting note: I recently moved to the south of France (Atlantic coast, not Côte d'Azur) and while in my home country I'm definitely not someone who wears shorts all the time, the temperature where shorts are still considered as suitable is way lower for myself than it is for the French in this region
hmm i start wearing my good jacket when it dips below 10C, add a hoodie or the like below 5 and more layers of it starts freezing
Was about to write something similar
The same goes for "warm outside".
During winter 15°C is warm, autumn it's arround 18-20°C and summer is anything above 30°C (used to be 25°C)
Politicians of that nature can be found anywhere
10 years ago the whole country was happy when there was finally a day where it was 28 degrees and no rain
Now we're all happy when there's a day where it's colder than 25 degrees
(It's a bit exagurated but still)
For me it depends
Rain after a week of 25°C is heaven to me
Rain when it is 15°C or lower (until it becomes proper snow that actually stays for a few days) sucks
The same goes somewhat for wind
Temperature wise 2 days of 30°C was a lot and now we often wish for rain
A lot has changed in the last 8 summers
Autumn is still wet, summer not so much
I just see the map of europe in my head
I suppose no real words come to mind
I just see the map of Europe and the flag of the EU/Council of Europe
Home, Brussels and Travel
All these words are in Blue in my head
Union
Soviets
Stalin
Everything leads to Stalin eventually
I just picture the European flag
Union
Stars
Safety
I don't get emotional often, but hearing "*Alle Menschen werden Brüder*" just gets to me some way
It's the colour of the council of Europe
Likewise, Etheopia has one of the oldest christian cultures, so they would be European too then
Same here
I am a Belgian living in Sweden and it just feels like Belgium except people speak Swedish and there’s more nature
In french, we have two expressions with "*having balls*" (but no *big*), depending on how you translate *balls*.
*Avoir les boules* (literally balls) means being afraid, while *Avoir les/des couilles* (testicles) means being not afraid, being brave
In Flemish we don't say that someone has 'big' balls but we rather acknowledge they have balls to begin with
• *"Amai, die heeft ballen aan zijn/haar lijf
with extra emphasis on 'ballen'. It roughly means that
• *"Damn
he/she has balls
On the other hand when someone isn't brave at all we say they have no balls at all
* *"Die heeft geen ballen aan zijn/haar lijf
Ballen van staal (balls of steel) is brave in Dutch
In Belgium when I was a kid we used to say "t'as les boules, t'as les glandes ? T'as les crottes de nez qui pendent
" which means "ehh looser you're afraid" or trolling someone like "u mad
Because it's so damn expensive
Austria or Germany have similar views for a lower price
You'll get more bang for your buck there
yo, leman lake is so beautiful though
Only 20% smoke
I don't think there is one general perception about it, but our government has been trying their absolute hardest to decline the number of smokers even further
Years ago smoking was banned in restaurants and more recently there have been campaigns to encourage parents to stop smoking inside since the smoke lingers and damages their kids
Since a few months it's also illegal to smoke if you're in a car with children
As far as my personal perception goes, I dislike it because I can't stand the smell and it is VERY noticeable if somebody just went out to smoke
I saw somewhere that in Amsterdam, of those aged between 18 and 35, a whopping 41% smoked though
How can you guys even afford it with the sigarette prices in the UK
>When we were young, my wife and I both worked in the non-profit sector, and we, in theory, could have transferred to one of the European offices (we were interested in Portugal, Slovakia, and Bulgaria), but the US office was always short-staffed and the timing was never right
Transferring NP work abroad is a pain
IT's really a major dilemma in possibly sacrificing your work for living somewhere more preferable
Why would you do that lol
This
In my experience Francophones are quite rude
Even in Brussels, the French speaking population here are given the reputation of being quite rude and I've heard this complaint not only amongst the expatriate population but also amongst the Flemish
>Well, it wasn't really about the rudeness but the idea that all French people speak English
Oh I didn't see that part
It definitely has not been my experience either
In Brussels even young francophone people speak English very poorly and they tend to be monolingual as well
When I lived in Germany if they noticed you struggling they wouldn't hesitate to speak English, but in Brussels, they tell you that their English is just as shit so you both speak to each other very poorly in the other's language
l’m surprised we haven’t seen the long list of Italian culinary grievances
Ask Belgians if they speak French or Dutch
Both go crazy after that question
We assume you know the right language
To be fair, Holland is Flemish for Nederland
The fact that the Hollanders don't like it is an added perk for some people
Infuriating indeed
And for some reasons, only Belgium is victim of this
We don't see people wanting to split Switzerland
Something equally infuriating: serving beer in the wrong glass
I mean if they asked about Belgium the technically wouldn’t be necessarily wrong
Feel your pain tho
Did you get an answer tho
Lol
I love how equally annoyed and resigned this comment comes off
Saying multiple fries are friet always makes me uncomfortable lol
Friet will always be a singular fry for me
I've got worse:
French Fries
Or saying Swiss chocolate is the best chocolate
Or Heineken
Or the *Dutch*!!
Let's do a switcharoo here
Let your Brabant, Limburg and Zeeuws-Vlaanderen join us in our homely yet lovely mess of a country
In the meantime our prime minister will sing the Marseillaise instead of the Brabançonne
In Antwerp we even have a song [about it]
>!For non-Dutch or Antwerp speeaking people, it's a song about how a bus full of Dutch/Hollanders is the biggest threat to the peace in our country
The Dutch and Belgians are natural enemies
Like Frenchmen and Belgians
Like Germans and Belgians
Like Belgians and other Belgians
Darn Belgians, they ruined Belgium
Belgium doesn't discriminate
We love and hate everything, including our King
If you ever go camping you always find the people you hate (the Dutch) and the people you love (also the Dutch)
Nah, I love our French-speaking wierdos
To be honest, outside of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen and other regions close to the borders we cannot recognise what part of the Netherlands someone comes from unless they tell us
So when we mean Holland we really mean either 75% of the Netherlands or the Netherlands as a whole
Our officials dumped a big load of Mask and the ones that were left were conserved in bad places which cause moisture
I think you know why it’s not really wholesome 100
I have never seen anyone do it here in Belgium
There are some designated beaches but on the regular ones I haven’t seen anyone sunbathing topless
This is not an opinion
There is actual data on this
This article ( [  talks about a French survey about this exact topic
They have the numbers at 48 % in Spain, 34 in Germany and 22 in France
But it is going down
Of the five countries they tested, Spain was the only one that did not show a significant decline
Keep in mind that 'public' is a relative term
In some areas, there might not be all that many people around even when the beach is technically public
Some areas also have specific nude beaches that are semi-closed off but are still technically 'public beaches', which could make the numbers appear lower then they really are (i.e. 'I have never seen it so it has to be low', when in reality, they are all concentrated in one specific location)
Yeah, the article isn't very detailed
The actual study shows the results in way more detail, but it's in French
This is a powerpoint of the actual results: [
Slide 13 basically shows what you're asking (only for France)
They asked whether you ever went topless to the beach
And they give the options 'yes, in the last 3 years (dark blue)', 'yes but not in the last three years (light blue)' and 'no'. But they asked this in specific situations
First about company (partner, female friends and male friends) and then about location (deserted beach, low crowded beach and crowded beach)
Not surprisingly, 'deserted beach' and 'in front of partner' have way higher numbers
Public beach in the last 3 years is at only 5 %. There is also a ton of data about sexual orientation, political affiliation, religion, age,...
So as you might expect, the number is quite high if you include 'everyone who has ever taken their top of in front of their partner or close (female) friends on a deserted beach', but if you go to 'regularly going topless on crowded beaches', the numbers are way lower
Around 50 % is probably a good guess for the first situation
For the second, it's somewhere in the single digits
This is like more expensive than what the german guy said for this price you can go on vacation to germany and buy a falcon and go back
Wow,belgium is expensive
Wasn't orban doing something with over hours
Thats fucked up
I totally understand the Googling
If you know a complete stranger will come and live in your home, you might just be curious about this person and you also might want to be (mentally) prepared for what kind of person to expect
It doesn't seem that strange to do a quick Google search
I wouldn't mention it that I Googled you
If for some reason they find it important to know and talk about what they read, they should have found another way of bringing it up
Maybe just ask about your parents or home situation in the US and see how you reacted to it
I might understand that they wanted to be honest and fair by telling you
'Hey actually we Googled you and we saw ... we were wondering ...' But if you do go that far, then you do that in a private conversation between you and the family without any outsiders present
I don't really see any problem in this
I would call this pretty much expected behaviour
And I can't speak for all host families in the entire continent, it's just for myself
Keep in mind that you are living with those people, in their house, for probably a long time
That's much, much more heavy on privacy in any way than doing a quick google search
> Can I attribute it to the “bluntness” of the culture
I don't think so
The way you feel about it doesn't have a lot to do with any culture
It's probably just your personality
It might take some time, but unfortunately you'll have to find a way to deal with it, it happens a lot that people you might or might not know bring it up
It's not to offend you
My husband's parents did the same to me when I first started dating him (Belgian )
They also regularly search their childrens' names and mine online to see what comes up even though we're adults
Old English : asideca few words here and there, can't understand it
Scots : I get the global idea
The others are fine
My mother tongue is Dutch and I'm pretty much fluid in English, and I couldn't understand a word from old English
That being said, I don't understand much of the oldest Dutch texts either
The first two examples are OK, but the rest is just ksncoanfnaoncKgssgss
The last version (Scots
) was OK too
I can't speak for the Dutch, but I had class on The Canterbury Tales and Shakespeare in secondary school
Plus class on Middle-Dutch
["Van den vos Reynaerde"] was a blast to read
So we got some practice in school
Early modern and middle English aren't that bad to read
They still look a lot like Modern English except for phrasings and individual words
Old English makes very little sense to me (I think it's more Norse-related than Germanic)
I don't think the ease of reading comes from that necessarily, or from knowing Dutch
I think it's just the English isn't *that* different and depending on your language skills one can make a better translation than an other
In Belgium we get presents from a guy in blackface
Or a bushel of twigs if you were a bad boy/girl
He's enslaved by this Turkish bishop who's actually white
Go figure
Oh dear, you've never heard French official speak english
Make that the cat wise
LOL
Hello Congo, how are you doing today
Our king's backyard was a big patch of land called Congo, the rest is history
Cutting of the hands of people who didn't work hard enough, genocides
It was bad
What happened in the Congo Free State is a pretty obvious one
Congo was colonized to satiate the ego of our megalomaniac King Leopold II
Local people were exploited to death, with harsh punishment if they didn't meet the quotas (infamous hand chopping, death
The treatment of Congo was so terrible that even other colonizing nations found it inhumane and over the top, to the point that the Belgian government was forced to take it over instead of the King
Estimations of the death toll vary wildly because of the absence of a census, but they range from a few millions to 15 millions, with 10 millions as a commonly accepted figure
Leopold II
My grandfather had to move from Silesia too, but we don't know more about that
He was born in what was called Hindenburg back then
And Kosovo
Considering the comments I see every time gypsies are mentioned on /r/europe, I think that this policy would be quite popular with the reddit crowds
Probably Leopolds II and The Congo
Also, the level of corruption in the Dutroux affair
Nothing's lower than crimes against kids
Chop Chop
*laughs in Belgian*
Which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't persecuted us and been asshole to us as a whole
Treat people like second grade citizens with less rights than others, and a revolt is the least you can expect
RYAN STARTED THE FIRE
You forgot about Iceland it seems, quite sure they suffered even more than Norway under your rule
They were the poorest nation of Western/Northern Europe due to the trade monopoly Denmark was forcing on them
Lentedip klinkt dan weer als iets om op een cracker te smeren
Same to ward of the spirit of Winter and thing like that, haven't got the chance to go to one in a long time though
We have the same thing in Mechelen (and Heist-op-den-berg), but with a different song ( *Sinte-Mette van de Ruggenuchte)
*  The last years it's loosing the competition against the imported Halloween
A Belgian that doesn’t like fries
My cousin doesnt like chocolate
Belgian that hates beer and doesnt give a single fuck about football: me
A Belgian "not really into fries"
I'm a Belgian person who does not like beer
A Belgian who doesn't drink beer or doesn't eat fries
A french person who supports government-proposed social reforms
Does that person exist
Or one that doesn't watch football/cyclocross/cycling
Same here
Are Germans known for their beer
Bread is French
Believe it or not but this very rare species does in fact exist
I am ‘one’
Less and less people like watching sports though
I get the joke but honestly fries in France are shit, like everywhere outside of Belgium
You have to fry them twice ffs
As for Belgian
Don't we all
Could be , I travel a lot in Europe but I've stopped trying to find decent fries a while ago
There's nothing like coming home and have your first meal home at your favorite friterie/frituur
There is no better way to eat fried potatoes than in a Belgian friture
Perfectly normal, I didn't know Americans use mopeds
Après-ski > skiing
Well it's a big part of our food culture as well, as we eat it twice a day
And unlike most countries we still buy our bread in bakeries instead of supermarkets
How dare you tell a Belgian how to fry his potatoes
It's like telling an Italian how to make pizza
Edit:
for Belgian fries: You just fry them for a bit, let them cool off, either freeze them in or fry them again, done
The kind of potato is very important tho
Mfw someone unironically says that freezing fries before baking them is a good way to make fries
Pretty much the same in Europe
You're lucky I'm open minded and maybe I'll give it a try but don't disrespect us like that again
In Dutch, both are female
Strange, as it's so close to German
Hold on
The sun takes a nap at night
I'll let myself out
Absolutely correct
For Belgium I would say the 1880's till 1914
Economically we were a powerhouse, we had colonies, we were the second industrialised country in the world and brought innovation and technology to the world
Ofcourse people did not have voting rights or there was a voting system where the rich had more votes than the poor, so socially there were a lot of problems
It came to a halt when the Germans took our entire industry sector away
Just reading this made the Kingdom Come intro play in my head
Definitly not a Golden Age for one half of the country
Dutch as a language was banned, including from schools
Industry was built up in Wallonia, not in Flanders, making it richer than Flanders and causing massive migration
Overall i dont think we have had a Golden Age, not as "Belgium" at least
I don’t think colonies of any kind should be a reason for a “golden age”. Quite the opposite actually
We even use it in Dutch
Well, most countries do not have a golden age then
There was always suppression in the past and if we are to count that we also just have to count all of the poor people who were suppressed and then noone ever had a golden age
Belgium as a nation was mighty and was in the top of technology and power, laying railroads in places as far as Astrakhan and Caïro
It was very golden age-ish, but people suffered, as they have everywhere at all times in history
There is always poor and oppressed people, but generally the main population is doing okay if its a Golden Age
In Belgium during that time, only the 1% elite really did good for themselves
Thats why i dont wanna call it a Golden Age
No matter how far in technology and power (which neighbouring countries had more of at the time) we were, a majority of the native population was heavily oppressed
I'd hardly call laying railroads in Egypt and building trams in a Chinese city a Golden Age
Just fyi, Astrakhan is in Russia ;)
And I wouldn't say so
Englands golden age was during Elizabeths reign, a time where catholics where heavily oppressed and the general populace was poor and dying all the time
Golden ages from those times are mostly calculated by the elite, the art, the power and technology of a country
During this time we excelled in those 4 categories
I agree with you it would have been a horrible time to live in, but golden ages are often not that fun
Thats just history for ya
Oh i wasnt talking about Astrakhan haha, we built some trams for a decade about a century ago in some Chinese city near Beijing
Forgot the name, Tianjing maybe
Tsingtao
Anyway
Well, technology wise we werent really that amazing at the time, and art and literature didnt do well at all either at the time given the massive oppression and culture killing government
We werent militarily strong either at the time, so really all you have is a rich and colonial elite
Hardly a Golden Age, even by those standards you mentioned
That bout of Montezuma's revrnge doesnt count sice that was in Colombia so Id say that nasty cold I got while on vacation in Montenegro
Having a cold with fever in a hot climate when not in your comfortable home sucks
As a kid I was basically always in the water
I have home videos of my grandparents and me looking angry when I was like 4 because we were going to a market instead of swimming, I wanted to swim damned
Every year I had an ear infection
Several years later we went to Rose, Spain
It had a dirty pool
You couldn't really see underwater
I now work with swimming pools and I shudder to think how that thing was maintained, or the lack of it
Knowing how fucking easy it is to keep a pool clear
My parents also hired a speedboat
Outside of the swimming area at the beaches there were entire groups of jellyfish, the big red ones
Thousands of them
So me on the front of the boat, wind in my ears for like 30minutes - 1hour
Yea, we went back a few days earlier than planned because of my ears when it started to hurt 2 days later
Normal medication I got from our house doctor didn't do shit and my mother, a nurse, pulled the alarm
The next day after my mother decided that I saw one of those "I studied until 35 to learn about ears" type of deals
Not a fun experience overall and as a result I have a swimming pool in my backyard of 15x5x1
5 meters and I've swum maybe twice in the last 3 years
Never been robbed or anything in Europe
Worst trip for me was Vietnam
Nothing super bad but i went to disneyland paris and it was hyper cold at the time the coldest winter in many years
I'd say it's good for you
Plenty of people think Paris is the only thing worth visiting in France
While it's certainly a pretty city and interesting cultural wise, the rest of the country has plenty to offer as well and the people outside of Paris are lovely
This might be a mith in our city but during WW2 our city was one of the only one's not sabotaged by either the Germans or the resistance because they hid it somehow
They're very proud of that fact
My school was a hospital for the Germans during WW2
>Limburg
Do they have a Limburg everywhere lol
Of course that happens in Belgium
Hey I saw that in the news
Yep that sounds like Denmark
What city
It _was_ a Mercedes-Benz
Even though our roads are terrible, there are constantly road works
Yes of course
Fill the holes with bumps and fix the bumps with holes
Belgium, many parts of Wallonia are beautiful but with no tourists, as tourists almost exclusively go to Flanders
Western Wallonia : Mons,Tournai,the canal of Centre with the hydraulic elevators,the "Fagne" area,Chimay area (and his famous beer made by monks),etc and it's a land of folklore
I think that it would be very nice  for those who want to think outside the box in Belgium
I was in Sumava National Park and I enjoyed a lot,few tourists
Is that really true
I thought the Ardennes, Mons, Liege, Spa and the Caves of Han-sur-Lesse werr visited often
It is mostly local tourism (mostly flemish), but not international
Due to a lack of international publicity (or negative publicity) you have places in Wallonia where, for example Dutch or German tourists will drive past to France, and local businesses would often say "they are driving past the area to go somewhere in Lorraine or Champagne, to a place that is less beautiful, further away and more expensive
I know this is not really what OP asked but I'll still say it
Try to know at least some basic words of most common languages in Europe and definitely when you are going to a different country for a trip
A 'thank you' or 'good morning' could make a big difference on how someone percieves you
I was ones in a little french restaurant near the Italian border and we thought that the owner had a different french accent
We figured out that he was probably from Italy and when he served us we all started to say 'Grazie'.
His mood suddenly changed and he started smiling and saying 'Prego'. That night we got a free dessert and some free limoncello he made
We went back more than a week later and he still remembered us
Making us feel the most welcome out of all his customers
So yeah, most people have no idea how much everyone appreciates trying to speak your language
The little effort it takes can make a person's day
Most higher-paying jobs here in Belgium require you to be at least bilingual (Dutch/French + English) and many trilingual (Dutch, French and English
German is also a very important language if you work in an industrial or trade-related setting
Spanish may be interesting if you work in tourism and so might be Italian, but otherwise most other languages are only useful in niche contexts
Depends on what your exact plans are
If you'll be living in a country, the main language of that country is helpful
If you want something that's useful in general, business-wise, French might be the way to go
Most people who deal with international stuff speak English well enough, but French-speakers are a bit notorious for speaking French-only
I've worked with people from the Netherlands, Germany, France, England, Spain and India and the French tended to have the most issues with communication
It depends on your region even the best european languages like German or french wont help you in Poland or Italy so i would just learn the language of the country you are going to work in
Just finished my second year of Russian in night school
Basic conversations, going to a restaurant or hotel, finding something in a shop, showing someone around in my city,... are all doable
Tried finding the post office and buying stamps in Kiev, that was more of a challenge but worked out in the end
Fluency is a looong way off
I have a Russian penpal who I text with occasionally but I have to use a google translate half the time even though we're keeping the Russian on a "simple" level
The only way to get really fluent in it is to be fully immersed constantly, I think
If someone learnt german in school for economic necessity, he would not be a native speaker
So actually, what you say is not true
Amazes me too, and the reasons people of nations without an ID card mention against implementing an ID card for all citizens
We don't congratulate the family for their child birthday for starters, that's just weird "congratulations you made your child survive X years
" Saying gefeliciteerd to anyone but the birthday girl/boy is very weird to me
We do have snacks and bites like you do and sit together but it's not always in a circle, we usually sit around the table or in the sofa
The flemish government and flemish community government are merged together so we only have 6 governments
Dutroux in Belgium
Even more than Leopold II
Dutroux
He kidnapped several early-teen girls, raped them and then starved them to death in his basement
If he was released from prison today, he would be found death within a day
A person that knew about what was happening got released from prison last year and he was beat up badly within a week
Belgians despise Dutroux, rightfully so
Leopold 2 or Dutroux
Dutroux probably the most because it’s more ‘recent’.
Some bearded fella with a passion for hands
Leopold 2
And also Dimitri Bontinck, he tried to become famous on his extremist son
He's a cunt
Marc Dutroux
Whenever we go to germany, Atemlos is our song
Mostly because of alcohol
Leopold ||| is also on the list I'm pretty sure
I think most Belgians don't know jack shit about what Leopold the second did
Dutroux is definitly more hated
Ding, dong the witch is dead
Do you guys like, don't hate Putin
Mmmh
Recently I'd say Marc Dutroux
In the past, I'd say leopold the 3rd as he was a coward
Leo 2nd did a lot of bad things, undeniably, but he put Belgium in the Map (at the cost millions of lives, I know)
Dimitri Bontinck is definitely an attention whore, but I don't think many people actively hate him
To Bontinck: "I don't even know who you are"
I guess he didn't get **that** famous after all
>  Dimitri Bontinck
As a Belgian, I have never heard about him, quite sure most Belgian have never heard of him either
He doesn't even have a Wikipedia page, nor in French nor in English
You know you can do roman numerals using the i/I right
Definitely
I just feel that a lot of people don't know about the horrors of Leopold III
Many people don't even know about the horrors of Leopold II either
It's something that older mothers would say here too
Like age 50+.
Really
I've always thought he was a bit infamous in other countries, especially compared to other killer rapists
I'm pretty sure most Belgians now at least a little bit about what happened in Congo
I'm 17 and I have heard of him for years and I never watch the news
A little, but not enough for hatred at all
Ask a random person on the street who in the history of Belgium was most hated, most won't say Leopold 2
You are Flemish
Yeah that's true
Yes
That's why you have heard about him then
He is not famous at all in Wallonia, since he doesn't even have a Wikipedia article in French, and not even in English, and nearly all links in Google search are in Dutch
He is thus irrelevant internationally
Yeah sometimes I forget how different Flanders and Wallonia are (in terms of news and stuff)
I'm pretty sure everyone knows about what he did in Congo
I think for Flanders it is very hard because we can notice immediately from which part of the country tje the natives are because of our many dialects
And mastering dutch +mastering the local tongue is very hard
it is very funny that newcomers don't learn standard Dutch, they learn the local dialect
Nigh impossible
Dutch has this weird thing with adjectives and articles
There are literally no rules about them
Native dutch speakers "feel" which one is correct, but you obviously don't have that as a non-native speaker
I think it's almost impossible to fully know the language
There are a lot of foreigners who live here for decades but still make mistakes with using 'de' instead 'het'. But that's understandable
>e.g. there is no 'dt' rule, there only is stem+t, whatever that stem may be
My whole life is a lie
I feel like dt mistakes are made more by native speakers than by people who learn Dutch
Ik wordt daar echt niet goed van
Bit late to answer but in Belgium the phrase you find weird is used more than the other one
If they can make it work then yeah sure I would love it
I wouldn't really want to get it if the system is half-assed though because that could possibly mean economic disaster
Could be good for my allergy, I have severe allergy to work
Someone or the Belgian subreddit posted the employment contract from someone in late 19th century
Those people had to bring their own coal to the factory and heat the place up in their own spare time before work
So yeah seeing where we stand now I know it will be reality sooner or later
But research has shown a 4 day work week doesn't necessary translate to less productivity
Obvious exceptions in factories etc
Edit: in fact, in can lead to an increase in productivity, source:
>Two-thirds of voters reportedly rejected an increase in the country's minimum annual leave from four weeks to six, which would have brought it in line with most other West European countries
so it's not that hard to pay for
* Thank you UK, France, Poland, Canada and US for saving our asses during both world wars
* Also thank you UK for supporting our independence and helping us grow into one of the first countries tot industrialise
* Thank you The Netherlands and Luxembourg for being the best neighbours someone could wish for
* Thank you Norway for being such a splendid country with nice people
Thank you to every country that helped in the liberation of Belgium and others occupied by Nazi’s. Especially thankful to Canada because of which the street I live in is what it is today
They rode in Brugge liberating it in the process
The place they entered the city was none other then what we know call the Canada brug
On which ever lasting words of thanks are adorned
Yeah, i would like to thank Italy for inventing Nutella
Appearantly the Ferrero family is amongst the richest families in Italy
This is a disgrase,
they should be the richest family in the world for inventing Nutella
Italy: I LIVE FOR YOUR FOOD + Latin culture
Greec: old Greek culture
France: Baguette
Turkey: Your bread
England: your accent is so funny
Thank you for not forgetting us in that battle
Thank you for always being on our side when war loomed, even if it meant going against the odds in the beginning
Thank you for starting the industrial revolution (twice) and spreading it to Belgium so we could become the first country with trains outside of the British Isles
Thank you UK for saving our asses during both world wars and supporting our independence in 1830
Yeah,  thanks for that
I can understand German and Afrikaans, but as someone from Limburg don't ask me to translate West-Vlaams (West-Flemish) because that's like Chinese to me
Spoken, I can barely understand the Limburgish and West Flemish dialects of Dutch (or languages)
I sometimes have trouble understanding people from the Northern Netherlands if they have a thick accent
Afrikaans is also very hard, even if they talk slowly
Not a chance I would understand German
Written, I can understand pretty much everything of all the dialects
I can understand most of Afrikaans and a bit of German (maybe 10-20%) and Frisian
Une bière svp, een pintje aub, una cervesa por favor, bitte ein bier,... I'm all-round
Might want to use languages instead of countries
I think my dutch as a Flemish person is as good as a dutch person :p.
Anyway, Dutch and South-African is more or less a yes
Father made a joke at the expense of my mother at the entrance of one of the wine gardens/castles near Cape Town and the girl standing there to greet us burst out laughing :p.
Written German makes me get the gist
Just don't ask details
Spoken if I really pay attention, some of it
I never studied German but depending on the subject can understand anywhere between 10 to 40% I guess
And we can speak it like Jean-Marie Pfaff lol
You better put us in the same lists as the Netherlands, since more than half the country speaks Dutch (there's even a German minority, but I'll let that slide)
To answer your question, I can often get the general meaning in Afrikaans and German, but there certainly are words and sentences I don't understand at all
**Belgian** : I can understand France French and, Swiss French, and they understand us too, except maybe for a few regional/slang words here and there
For Canadian French it's a bit tricky, although I think they have the ability to tone it down so that it's very understandable for us Europeans
For example I can watch Canadian Youtubers and understand them perfectly, but Canadian TV shows are a bit hard to follow
For the French in Luxembourg I feel like it's mostly spoken by French and Belgian expats so again, it's easily understood
Romanian is not understandable by French speakers
Some similarities will make it apparent it's a romance/latin language, but it's very different from French
I can speak for Dutch too
Afrikaans is its own language
It has Dutch roots but it has changed significantly
A Dutch person will catch words here and there and maybe figure out the general meaning of sentences but it's not like both languages are mutually intelligible
For German, there are a lot of similarities but again, they are different languages
Most Dutch people know some German through school as well
Easy sentences will be understood by Dutch people, but for some reason, the same cannot be said when it comes to Germans understanding Dutch
> France/French Canada (Québec)/Belgium/Luxembourg/Switzerland
Yes as long we use french but well if it's a german swiss that doesn't use french or a flemish belgian that does the same then it's obviously harder
Flemish (Dutch) Belgian here
i can understand most south african as long as its not too quick
most different words can be derived from context and most verbs are almost exactly the same
German is a bit harder, but if you can speak dutch and english, german is understandable, again, if its not too fast or the german is too angry :P
Belgian French, Luxembourg French and Regular french are (almost) exactly the same
Its like the difference between British, American and Australian
the only difference im aware of between Belgium and France is: septante instead of soixante-dix/nonante instead of quatre-vingt-dix
I understand on the Luxembourg (Dialect) side, Luxembourg, German, Afrikaans (i think) bit not Dutch nor Flemish
On the French side, Walloon (some from Heinaut and Namur, not Liege) French, not Corsican, I somewhat understand Breton, Quebec
I don't remember the name of the American French language but i will listen to it if someone show me some piece
Maar ik kom uit Brabant en ik begrijp u goed, zenne
West-Vlaams is more of a dialect of Vlaams
I'm form Flanders and French is indeed an official language that you learn, but if you never use that language in your everyday life, but only in school, you will not learn that language
I can understand French, but only basic stuff
Don't ask me to have a conversation in French because that's something I can't really do
As for German, that language isn't mandatory for everyone in school
I only had German for 2 years in school
I can understand it because it is very similar to the dialect from my region in Flanders, Limburg
West-Flemish if spoken on television will have subtitles
Might be similar to other countries but I don't know so I'll explain it here to give you an idea
If you take a city like Ghent, where I went to school, the dutch teacher could tell which one of the 14 regions of Ghent you came from by the way you talk
I wasn't from Ghent, I was from 30 kilometers away
(studied IT which my local high school didn't offer) The guy heard me talk and knew where I was from, a small town of 10k 30 kilometers away
The guy in our class from Brugge, capital of West-Flanders, we often had problems understanding as he often spoke West-Flemish
For example, he used "two and a half" to mean 14
30 instead of "half three", leading to some confusion on occasion
We're all capable of talking simple dutch
But it's not really how we talk with friends in most cases
When talking about Belgium, you are supposed to be confused
The saying here goes that if you think you understand Belgium, the explanation you got was no good
I wish people would stop holding up the myth of "Vlaams" being a language
The official languague is standardized Dutch, following the rules of the language union
Then people from the Netherlands usually say "Vlaams" to refer to either a huge range of dialects, which can be divided into 3 groups (real "Vlaams" including West- and East- Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish) or the "Tussentaal" which is mostly Dutch with some language features that most of these dialects have in common (such as the use of ge/gij instead of je/jij and saying u a hell of a lot)
Neither these dialects nor the tussentaal have standardized forms though
So TL:DR it's time to stop saying we speak Vlaams and admit we speak Dutch, albeit with dialectic features or regional variations
Because there is no standardized form of "Vlaams", people refer to different things when they say they speak Vlaams and the exact way we speak differs widely depending on the region
We all learn standard Dutch in school though and know perfectly well how to speak it as our mother tongue
I've edited: "een pintje aub" is in dutch
[West-Flemish subtitles (Dutch only)]
I think this fits here perfectly
Hahaha that's so true
I always see it as follows: I speak Dutch with a Flemish accent with influences from my local dialect which is between Kempisch and Antwerps
So it will be:
Language: Dutch
Accent: Flemish
Dialect: Kempisch/Antwerps
Or in short, a form of tussentaal with influences from Antwerp/Kempen
Yes that one
Yes i can understand it but it sounds a bit more archaic than Quebecois (less developed)
"Dat konnemi vorstelle datte de verstehst"
As the other guy said, basically dutch dialect
"Da kun(ne)ke me nie voorstelle datte/daje da versta(t)"(I mean, multiple options)
The above is plain dialect heavy dutch
Aub= please
Als het u belieft means st like if it pleases you
All the time
What happens in the US these last couple of years generates so much heat that journalists just have to pick up on it
We're all living in America
Here is the website of a quality reputable Belgian newspaper: [
The categories are Recent | Domestic | American Elections | International | Opinion
This is from a country which is still forming its own government, we have quite a bit of political crises at home and in Europe
I think European news is most lacking
You have to be quite a politics nut to know the internal politics of your neighbouring countries beyond simply the heads of state
I know more representatives and senators from the US than European MEPs, or Dutch or French or German parliamentarians combined
Not all that much actually, the elections arent really covered this year, because  we still have no gouvernemt since 2018 or so and corona
Since 2016 almost every day, every time
It gets old tbh
Our news often talks about the US when Trump makes a stupid remark or when the covid cases do something funny, or when some maniac shoots up a bunch of people again
So yeah, too much
This
I swear some papers must have a journalist whose only duty is to follow Trump on Twitter and make an article every time he says something stupid
True
And there's a looooot of stupid things to report on
Football, not American football
And that's basically a topic year round
August to May is play, June and Juli are transfer and transfer rumors as well as international games often
This is the only sub about Europe that isn t full of Americans telling us how we're being "replaced"
And people here are much nicer in general, of course
I feel like I do have quite a strong feeling of European identity for where I live
I feel more European than I do Flemish or Beneluxian (if that’s even a word, but not more than I do Belgian
That being said though I don’t think a European state is possible or desirable because of all the differences we still have between countries and regions
It seems too cumbersome to iron them out for the supposed benefits and I also just would not like it
If you don't believe a ''European identity'' exists, you're wrong
Just play dragostea din tei to any European
This might not be absolute proof of a single European identity, but it does show certain aspects of culture al over Europe have somehow merged together
This providing a base for a European identity, on top of whatever national or regional identity you already have
idk about that, i always thought the great thing about europe is that we can feel slighty connected with neighbouring countries but every country is still pretty different and unique
Wait what sarcasm
This song unites europe
It's not a particularly good song, but every European has heard it and had it stuck in their head at some point in their life
Too bad, while the BENELUX was the one who basically started the EU, so its countries should have more attention on them, even considering Brussels is sometimes considered the de facto capital of the EU (Wich is not the case , there really is no capital)
As somebody from Belgium who went a week to Manhattan(holiday) and a week to Miami(work)
Way bigger divide between men and women(feeling only really but as a 20 year old guy the entire thing was kind of creepy on more than one occasion
Some things American women seemed to be ok with that would just not fly over here)
How workers are treated
I would laugh and walk out with some of the things they ask employees to do there
That entire culture of "money" that is everywhere to a dumb degree
Watched an NBA game and the basket seemed to be a side activity, left during 3rd quarter
I'm on a plane to Tennessee, let me advertise to you(captive audience much
Overly social for me(more of a personal thing)
Not allowed to be drunk in public
Again, Belgian here, everything around alcohol is weird over there
My father was drunk as fuck on Miami South Beach but luckily nothing happened
The food
Omg, the fucking food
Yes I'm sure there is plenty of good shit
But that bottom layer cheap food here in Belgium can still be recognized as food
Not so much in the US
Finding actually BAD food is a challenge in most European countries I've visited
The loads of non-fresh food in the US makes even basic meals awful
Second worst place to have a quick bite to eat after my holiday in Vietnam
Again, not talking actual non-chain restaurants which are as good as anywhere else
Haha no worries
Maybe it's limited to my circles
Sexy dressed waitresses to lure costumers isn't really a thing here
The entire "cheerleader" thing, when we walked out of the NBA game we walked past a bunch of 6-12 year old girls in cheerleader outfits
The entire thing just felt seedy to me
That's the best word to describe it I think, seedy, poor, in bad taste, something like that
Again, nothing I'm saying here is objective but in higher class/more expensive places I've visited in Europe(London, Paris, Rome, etc
) female employees didn't try to have their tits hang out
Sex and high class don't really mix from my perspective in the context I'm thinking about
I'd say something about Belgium but
There really isn't anything touristy
Maybe manneke pis
A statue of a peeing boy of half a metre with so many asians around it you can't even see it
The Bulgarian coast has become a quick favorite with my friends the last two years
It's cheaper than going to some party beach in Spain and thus getting more popular
Sorry :(
Netherlands or France
France I would say, they are somehow disliked or seen as annoying by both Walloons and Flemings
Maybe Flemings will say the Netherlands, but Walloons don't care about the Netherlands
The Dutch for sure
It depends, most Wallonians despise Frenchies due to the fact that Belgians are the butthole of many French jokes and are perceived as the "inherently stupid northerners".
The Flemish would probably say that the Netherlands are their biggest rivals, but I think that their rivalry isn't as intense as the one between Wallonia and France
And as a Brusselaar, the logical choice would be both, but since most of us are native French-speakers and are more influenced by French culture, I would probably say France
I'm personally not really into this rivalry with our southern neighbor, I don't hate Frenchies, but I definitely despise Parisians
But then again, so do most non-Parisians in France :')
I thought Italy was your natural predator
Do we mean nothing to you
I disagree
You must be from the other side of the language border
Didn't know there was any love between the two of you
200km*
yes, and like a little brother we're the butt of most of your jokes
Also because of the cultural influence
Many Walloons know French celebrities, watch French television and movies, etc
while the contrary is not true
Another example: when speaking with French friends I made on the internet, me being up to date with that tiny thing what has been happening in their internal politics is considered normal whilst I don't expect them to know the name of our King
Maybe it has also something the « p'tits belges » expression
I don't know, as far as I recall (I'm 24), the stereotype has always been that French people are haughty and disdainful braggers
I also think wanting to win against France has to do with a sort of inferiority complex
As I've said, I made many friends who live « outre-Quiévrain », I'm just talking about general reasons for any possible rivalry, I love you guys
yes,although I was in the air when we lost to you guys, so the pilot was literally giving us updates on the game (we were flying Brussels airlines) and the stewardesses were dressed in our flag's colour's
It's just jokes about each other yeah so it's a friendly rivalry
That's a hard truth but it leaves us with the possibility of being Rival with France
This hurts my feelings
Haha the Dutch make jokes about Belgians being dumb and the Belgians make jokes about the dutch being cheapskates
I am Belgian and Dutch so I’m both I guess
I don't think most Belgians like you back hahaha
>some of you sometimes brag on things we do exactly the same (or better) but on reddit then they pass as french only
Do you have some examples
I love how in the final even the journalists and analists were clearly for Croatia and didn't want France to win
(I agree though)
I find it quite funny to see my country Belgium has deeply held rivalries with two countries (Netherlands and France) and the other two don't even realize it
It's like we're a puppy barking angrily at the two neighbouring houses and they just say: "Ooh, look how cute it is
It's no rivalry, a lot of Belgians just really don't like the Dutch
Percieved as arrogant
And we hate the French because they speak the same language as the 'Walen" and we hate Wallonia
Fun times
Edit: this is an observation
I woulf very much like to move to the Netherlands because I love Amsterdam and the Dutch mentality
Just to say but we are both student and I am also named Arthur
Your national monument is a windmill
And don't forget your countrymen in Limburg are catholics too
Well, if it is any concern, I like you
And we know we are a mess, and goddamn if it won't come to bite us in the ass one of these days
And you better believe it will be a direct bother
If it is any consolation, I am a real fan of your country
Amsterdam is just amazing
My therapist: dont worry, Californian wine doesn't exist
Californian wine:
And because they stole our fries
It makes some people very nationalistic towards Flanders and some people very anti-nationalist
> Since beer is lower ABV
You mean bad beers/pisswater beers (what most of Europe has), real/good/Belgian beer is as, if not sometimes more drunkenness-inducing, than wine
Ours beers are often at around 8-9°, with some going up to 10°. Malheur and Bush are at 12°.
I'd doubt that
A couple of years ago a Belgian boy drowned in the shower because he passed out drunk in it
In the U.S.:
Los Angeles
The city is ugly/superficial/disingenous and
tacky
Las Vegas: a complete shithole/tacky/.
Europe:
I agree with you about Ibiza/Mallorca/Magaluf and all other typical British youth holiday destinations
Just seems like a shit show of tackiness and obnoxious drunk people
London
I think this city underwhelmed me the most of any that I've ever been to
It's just
meh to me and I also found it quite ugly and not very nice on the eyes in relation to most of its architecture
Food is good though
Asia:
Bali
I think the hipsters have turned this place into a cliche
Granted I think if you stick to the places that locals go it would be a beautiful experience, but too many westerners are going there and ruining it with these overpriced yoga retreats and other nonsense
Bali was such a let down
It might be nice to spend your honeymoon there in a super luxuary suite without breaking the bank, but to discover the island, it was kinda disappointing
The other islands of Indonesia are way nicer
Edit: I'm a backpacker btw, so I don't like staying in resorts etc
I love meeting locals
Every place below the South of France during the summer
It’s too fucking hot
I also don’t see the point in visiting Barcelona, Miami, Las Vegas, Dubai/Abu Dhabi, Rio de Janeiro etc
Either too fake or tourist traps
Also: the niagara falls are such a scam
I always thought it was located in the middle of nature and stuff, how surprised I was to find out it’s in the middle of Canadian Las Vegas
Venice is terribly overrated
If you're planning on going to Italy I recommend Florence
That city is breathtakingly beautiful imo
Would go back any time I had the chance
I think British facades are quite ugly imo
The drab color of most of the homes does nothing for me in addition to the uninspiring brick
Re: public transport
The tube is definitely outdated
It reminds me of the Parisian metro
It is hands down the worst metro experience I've had to date, especially during the summer time
Disgustingly hot, stifling and just plain inefficient
I don't know, London just didn't have an overt energy/vibe that I got from a lot of other cities that I've visited like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin
I didn't spend too much time doing tourist things either in fact, I spent a lot of time all over the city and away from the "center" but when I went to these other enclaves I didn't feel like I was in London, if that makes sense
It just felt like any other place
Perhaps my expectations were too high
I loved the food and the cultural diversity the most, but the city as a whole made me realize that I personally wouldn't want to live there
Since I'm Jamaican it would have been nice to consider since it has a heavy Jamaican population and is quite a worldly city but
I don't know
Why
Made a roadtrip in California and it’s breathtakingly beautiful
Nothing can beat Yosemite and Lake Tahoe
Even Napa Valley is beautiful
I was raised in NYC and it really bothers me when people compare L.A to NYC
They are not the same and I think NYC has way more to offer and is a better example of what a city should be like than L.A (how can you look at that traffic and call it a city is beyond me)
People are blinded by the weather, but that's really all that it has to offer in my personal/heavily biased opinion
Can't blame them for attracting so many tourists
The place is stunning
In my personal opinion access to functioning/frequent public transportation and accessibility are key functions of a major city
The idea that you live in a city and almost need to own a vehicle is odd
Exactly
I lived in W. NY in a "city" where having a car was almost necessary
By my definition that is not a real city if you need a car to function
Just call it a small town
NYC is the best example of a real city because you literally do not need a car to live there
This is all based on my opinion
It's not a real city if you need a car
Work on the infrastructure and public transportation
It's unacceptable to live in a major city and have to need a car it literally defeats the purpose of living in a city
One that immediately comes to mind is
(DE) Schlimm, bad
(NL) Slim, smart
It can be pretty funny when something bad happens and a German speaker learning Dutch says 'that was smart' accidentally, or when a Dutch person is describing someone in German and says they're 'very bad', while they meant to say 'smart' .
Dutch from the Netherlands ‘poepen’ : to defecate
Dutch from Flanders ‘poepen’: having penetrative sex
Can become awkward
The first that comes to mind is
fabriek (dutch for factory)
fabric (stof in dutch)
Dutch in Dutch is Nederlands, but German in Dutch is Duits, meanwhile German in German is Deutsch and Dutch in German is Niederländisch
Everyone still following
Our hotel guy once told us that, so interesting
It's a minefield
I'd add actually (english, in reality) and actuellement (french, as of right now) which caused me some trouble
Some more false friends between French and English that tripped me up or amused me:
- Inhabité means uninhabited, not inhabited
- Une nouvelle means a short story, not a novel
- Un avertissement means a warning, not an advertisement
- Un coin means a corner, not a coin
- Tissus means fabric, not tissue
- Librairie means book store, not library
- (Culinary:) Entrée means starter, not entree
And in English slim means small or skinny
A slim person, een slimme persoon, and eine schlimme Person mean wildly different things
'Eng' can also mean narrow in Dutch, but it's a much more formal way of speaking and mostly confined to fixed expressions
For example: 'in de enge zin' = 'in its narrow sense'
To top it off: in Dutch, gift can mean both those things
Middag also happens to be the Dutch word for noon
Afaik 'gift' only has the English meaning in Dutch, but usually restricted to money
Poison in Dutch is 'gif' or 'vergif', without the 't', but the verb is still 'vergiftigen', so there's that
I love living in Belgium, it's my home, I know the country very well and feel a strong collection
Lot's of foreigners like to hate on Belgium but I feel like they hardly ever have a strong case against our country
It's mostly ideological, political, and other nitpicks that are big deals in theory but don't actually matter in day to day life
However, I would also love to live in a country with more great nature, and water for swimming and kayaking, Belgium has almost none of that
Canada, Germany and France are the countries I would consider
It's fine
All of our problems are really first world problems
For years I played with the idea of moving somewhere to make a difference but I became too cynical (in part due to my country)
For now, I'll stick to visiting, but I might would like to move somewhere with more of a national unity (but not unhealthy nationalism)
Issues here are so divisive, I'd like to live somewhere where people get along more easily
Also just in day-to-day life where making friends after your school years is basically impossible
Go to the r/askeurope mainpage, on the right you can edit your flair
Yeah Brussels really isn't the place to move to
I think it's much better in cities more to the north and not too big, like Ghent
I live: 15 mins from Bruges, 1h from Brussels, 2 hours from Rotterdam, 3 hours from Paris and Amsterdam and 4 hours from London
I really can’t complain
Newsflash: criminals and the mafia don't care about gun laws
Clearly you left at the right time to be able to do all of those things
Is Brexit an issue for you or will you be able to stay without problems
I suspect the latter but I'm interested how that all actually works for someone in your position
>I left France 2
I was like " but there's plenty of other tv channels".
Knitting a brown sweater shall always remain one of my favourites
Not about shitting but it is remarkable how Norse and Dutch are sometimes alike
I mean the first one I understood without translation
After a night of heavy beers some people feel the need to pour some 'speculaas van 't vat'.
Speculoos on tap
"Mouler un cake", Mold a cake
"Aller au throne", Going on the throne"
I don't really know any more
Yeah
Heard that one and others, but I like the brown sweater thing the most as it doesn't sound so vulgar I guess
Maybe both exist, like chocolatine and Pain au Chocolat
My grandpa was a lada garagist in Belgium, it was and still is his favorite brand , mostly the old nivas are the ones he liked
We have a lot of jokes about them that I won't tell because they're actually fairly stupid
AFAIK they were not that popular but you could see them once in a while
Especially the Niva (4x4) as it was cheap and quite good for the job it had to do
One of my friends still has one and I think it's the most basic car I've ever seen but you just can't kill it as you can fix it with some ducttape and thread if needed to
Spanish friend of mine, living here in Belgium, proposed to go out for dinner
I asked what time
"9:30 P.M?"
"**No
**"
> Also when I took some friends to lisbon for a week, they were 3,one  British one American and one from Canada, I told them we were going  clubbing, they thought we were going home attl 2am, I felt sorry for  them when we left at 7
That's a American vs European thing mostly, I also knew a Canadian who could not fathom nightlife in belgium and how it went on until the morning hours, and especially techno clubs and the music he could not wrap his head around lol
Sounds like a piece of dystopian fiction, or even satire:
"All trash are created equal
So I've travelled a bit and there are few time some cab drivers abroad got offended when I wanted to put on my seatbelt
They pleaded they were "good" drivers so there was no need
Then continued onwards rushing lights and tailgating like there's no tomorrow
Looking at you Turkey
Why would you not wear a seat belt
I'm Belgian and I've never heard of this
In my experience either the host has all the food or the host asks to guests if they can bring specific things
I have never tipped in Germany before because I didn't know I am supposed to
I don't want to be rude, but Spanish can be loud as hell
Think there was a group of about 6 Spanish tourists in my main bar about a month ago
I don't mind a bit of noise, it's a bar after all, but this was so out of place
I was actually wondering if they even noticed it that they were the only noise besides the music
What utter bullshit
> “Northern European friends” (mostly Dutch and Germans)
It's amazing how to the mediterraneans, everything else is 'Northern Europe' :p
My North-Germanic brethren and the Finnish would like to have a word, signore :p.
No, but when he and I use English as a bridge, we use it in speech nonetheless
It's a European thing in general, going home at 2am after going out is something you do when you have to work the next day or you're 16 and your mom is picking you up
I just read this in cockney
I am Belgian and I've done this often
But bbq is the only situation where this is acceptable
Because they didn't order alcohol
That's literally dinnertime
I know, but taken out of context the phrase seems like a really cynical view of humanity :p
Oh, I have been to Spain, Portugal, Italy and Malta, but you guys are taking the lead, that's for sure
Certainly when you're in a group
Don't know what it is
I guess it's a personal preference as well as I just hate "loud" people
Certainly in public
I can't get my head around people that yell in the streets or are extremely loud in bars, restaurants etc
I'm so glad I have my headphones with me when I'm done working and I'm on the train
If you are, you're gonna love it
Most expats I met as a masters & PhD did
\> Many Millennials don't drink alcohol anymore
Source
This just seems like a reddit anti-alcohol centric opinion to me, ~~teens~~ 20's people definitely still drink tons in belgium
I think part of the reason Northern Europeans are considered more grumpy is because when they visit Sourthern European countries they are just hangry from having to wait 2 hours past dinnertime to eat
I think they meant it as in they don't necessarily feel the need to drink when going out rather than just not drinking at all
I'm 21 and I personnaly don't like drinking and back when I was 17-18 people used to try to pressure me into drinking regardless but now I get more people doing the same or ordering mocktails or just one drink for instance
It might have to do with age and maturity but I feel like they don't feel the need to get shitfaced all the time anymore (doesn't mean it never happens though)
Now if you're litteraly talking about teens (which are not millenials) yes they do drink tons of alcohol but I mean they're teens
True, I still stand by my point though, tons of people here in their 20's who drink, I feel like the idea that 'our generation drinks less' is just the bias of reddit users who are more likely to be surrounded by geekier / homey people

He's 67 fyi
If he was born in 47 he'd be 73
He's actually from October 52 so he's turning 68 this year
When pokemon Go was first released I joined a chat room with other people who played that game and one of them put a meme on there with a 'pokemon Go starterpack'. This was in 2016 and I wasn't as familiar with international culture as I am now
The meme contained a phone, a battery pack, something else and a handgun
I asked why someone would take a gun with them on the street, unaware that I would instantly trigger all Americans in that chatroom
To us in the Lowlands, anything that has a slope is a hill, and a mountain, well, we dont have any but a big hill is a mountain to us lol
I can already feel the difference between Belgium and France, can't imagine what the difference with Russia would be
When I was little, I was visiting far relatives in France
They wanted to go walking along the coast during the afternoon
I'm someone who gets car sick quite easily (even more when I was a child) so I asked  if it was far away
They said it was really close by, so I assumed they meant like 10 to 30min
Even 30min didn't seem super close to me, but I knew the French had slight different definitions
In the end it was probably around 2 hours to the coast which is NOT AT ALL closeby
There's also the whole 'poepen' thing which can make it funny if I'm watching some Dutch tv program
Well, I'm glad to learn, thanks to this comment and the reply of the Dutchie, that I at least learnt the proprer Belgian way of using voormiddag, namiddag, etc
during my Dutch learning lessons in secondary school
I didn't know this
Learned something new today, thanks
Misérable in French means : who lives in misery, that is, extreme poverty, hunger, lack of decent housing, of proper clothes, etc
That, and what the French person said
I never figured it out
wtf
I didn't even know this
It's very disturbing to hear a 4-5 year old child say something to his mom like "Ik ga even poepen
Yup, when living in China for a while I was really missing 'real' bread
Because everything there is like a brioche
&#x200B;
My teacher once told me he was in Harbin and people were really proud of their specialty bread because it was so different \[It was tougher and more savory than the normal bread in China, I assume it might be influenced by Russia as Harbin is so North in China and relatively close to Russia\]
But for my teacher who lived in Belgium it just seemed like regular normal bread
Yeah I looked that up this morning because of once again a case of irresponsible, lethal behavior by a cop and appearently of all countries in North-America, Europe and Asia only Palestine has a higher ratio of citizens killed by cops per total citizens than the US
'Voormiddag' isn't used *that* often
It also differs from person to person on which time it means
I would say voormiddag is from 10am - noon
Noon is untill 2pm and afternoon is untill 5 or 6 pm but other people may say something else
Actually for me I feel like 'voormiddag' is used all the time by me and the people around me
I would only very rarely use the word 'morgen' to refer to 11 am
How I used it approximately:
\*Morgen: Starts at 4-7am to around 9-10am
\[Depending on the situation, I would call 4-5am nacht, 6am is definitely 'morgen' for me\]
\*Voormiddag: Starting from 9-10am to noon (12h)
\*Middag: depending on the context either 12 o'clock or if it's clear that it's meant more as a period than a fixted time: 11:30am - 1pm (occasionally 2pm)
\*Namiddag: Starting from 1-2pm until 5-6 pm
\*Late namiddag: 5-6pm, depending on the situation it might also include 4pm
\*Avond: Starts around 6-7pm
"poepen" is exclusively anal sex
Land where you are free to pay your own debts after going to college or hospital
Having aspergers and just being rather a-social I'm happy living in Belgium
People leave you the fuck alone
Cashiers say 1 or 2 words, etc
So Belgium, Netherlands, anything more North, would have been the best possible fit for me and I got it
Can't imagine living in a more social place
Well we Belgians love our wide range of beer very much so it's not really a taboo to get drunk
Of course it all depends on the time and place
Getting drunk during the week while being alone is kinda frowned upon (and you probably have a problem) but during the weekend at a party in the right setting no one will make a big deal out of it
We don't care as long that they don't do anything stupid like trash other peoples property, or fighting or drive while you're drunk most is accepted and people will just laugh it away
You get laughed at if you dont get drunk every weekend
Here amongst people my age its kinda the standard thing to do
Never understood it
Same here, but the first fase starts at 15, not 18
Not in my family and circle of friends
Am I marginaal
:thinking:
Belgium: When I was little there used to be a veggie truck (but like the ones you see in markets, kinda like a stall) that came round a couple times a week, they had these bad, very loud speakers trough which the woman yelled the prices and promotions while the man drove the truck, so you knew they were coming and you could go outside
A bit like an icecream truck, but way bigger, and way more annoying (but very handy)
There was also someone who sold soup out of their car
If you wanted soup, you put your pot on the doorstep, they would pass and see, stop and ring so they could ask you witch soup you wanted
they had like a couple of big barrels of hot soup in their trunk) and you could pay them per scoop
I think these would be forbidden in Belgium
Firstly because public space has to respect our laws, you can't advertise on the public space for politics/religion, except during election times, and you can't really use the public space/infrastructure to proselytise
The only types of billboards you'll see will either be : ads/commerials, or public messages from the government (road safety, environment, ...)
Secondly, these would be seen as hate-speech, and thus against the law and punished by it
the closest to it I've seen was a banner on someone's house that's visible from the train
It was just white letters on blue canvas "Jezus leeft" (Jesus lives)
We have quite a few around Antwerp though, especially around the Singel
[Example]
The classic one one a tall pole like [these] are rare, usually it's on smaller poles or plastered against buildings or structures
Along the highway it is actually forbidden to advertise
That's why we only see road safety campaigns or road work stuff on there
Exactly this, I also tend to believe that the Christians population is a lot lower here and also a lot more moderate
(with the occasional jehovah's witness here and there)
Step holy spirit what are you doing
For me it's Catalan, more than any other Latin/Romance language
I would say Dutch and a little bit of German because I live in Belgium and we are a trilingual country
Otherwise Spanish
Imo Swedish kinda sounds like a toddler who is learning to talk but isn't quite there yet
Yeah, if you just know how to pronounce what's written, you can understand most things
Think info panels, restaurant menus, road signage and news papers
It does take some effort though, but it's definitely possible
In my experience, many German words sound like simple or misspelled versions of Dutch words or are bascially older variants of it
I agree
I remember one of my first classes of German we had a reading test
Almost everyone failed (even though we could answer in Dutch) because we didn't even understand what the text was about lmao
Many French-speakers will say Italian, but personally I find catalan easier, it's closer to French
Yeah but if you don't know those rules and they're speaking casually (as in fast), it's nearly impossible to understand
Beer
The best strong beers in the world are made in Belgium
Complaining about taxes
Even tv stations that don't get tax money people are complaining"wow did they made such a bad tv show with our tax money".
Yeah, my nephews are half Bulgarian and their name days are considered as important as their birthdays
My mom always found this odd as it's a tradition that pretty much disappeared over the past few decades here in Belgium
Belgium is still holding together due to Beer and football
I read that with Jimmy Carr's Birmingham accent, I feel sped
I mean, we do have the highest income tax rate in the industrialized world, so it's fair if you ask me
Fries from the "frietkot/frietuur"
The real Fries with mayonnaise
la [Mitraillette] (also called special or routier) i guess
Stoverij met frieten
Flemish stew with fries
A croque monsieur
You know somebody should really open up a frietkot with a drive thru
What about Wiener Schnitzel
Honestly, looking at the vitrine in my frietkot, choosing between al the snacks, and then going for the usual is part of the experience for me
Drive-thru would ruin the experience
Nope
Seen it plenty of times in Flanders, especially 'student cities' like Leuven
I see it a lot where I live but that's a 5 min drive from Wallonia
Oops I didn't see it was about *fast* food
Nope
I never see any Belgian flags, except when it's football
However, sadly I see more and more Flemish flags in my home city
In the Republic of Georgia, it's not weird
People are very proud of their nation there
In Belgium, it IS weird to showcase it, unless we're at a sports event
You get a flag with a big ass jupiler logo on a crate of beer during the football cups
That's about as far as it goes
The Flemish flag though is a different thing altogether, it's quite common in conservative circles and there's even a version with black claws (instead of red) that people tend to find offensive as it's associated by many with WW2 collaboration
Displaying a Belgian flag - World Cup and National holidays, other than that it’s not too common but can be displayed as a sign of unity in bad times
It’s not that weird to have a Belgian flag overall I think, it’s kinda whatever
Displaying or owning a Flemish flag - tends to have very bad connotations and kind of makes you seem like a nationalist unless it’s solely for the purpose of sports
Like our neighboring countries just hanging out a flag is weird
As in, I rarely ever see it
We have one that we hang out every 2 years for a few weeks
The weird thing is that here I imagine a Belgian flag is more a left wing thing while say, a Flemish flag(especially one with black instead of red claws) is more a right wing thing
I’m Belgian, and I’ve never even owned a Belgian flag
Displaying one would be kinda weird (except during the World Cup)
Yeah it's an important distinction compared to other replies here: displaying the national flag is not associated with conservatives
The Flemish flag I associate with right wing/secessionists
But the Belgian flag isn't popular in to be flown casually
Official buildings fly them, but that's about it
You're right about the Flemish flag, though most of the times it's not the real Flemish flag but rather the one provided by the ultra right political party
Dumbasses
I live in Brussels and I'm thinking of hanging out all the flags of identities that are represented in our household, but then I'd have to hang out 5 flags for just 2 people
Belgium, Flanders, Basque country, Pakistan and France
I do sometimes see a Belgian flag in Antwerp but it is indeed extremely rare comparatively
And many of these Belgian flag are handmade or have the logo of some beer brand (or newspaper) on them
> The second one with a red lion is the one to go with
The Province of Luxembourg has that exact same flag too, which is probably a tad confusing for people who wouldn't know the history of our countries
Are there Luxembougers wanting to "get back their lost territories" by the way ?
It's quite a shame because I really like the Flemish flag
I have 2 of them because I collect flags
>not the real Flemish flag
The flag you are talking about is the flag of the Flemish movement and is how the oldest flag is depicted in our sources
It isn't fake in any sense even if people try to link it to collaboration(which is obviously easy since many in the Flemish movement did collaborate)
But the flag itself is, much like the movement, not fascistic in nature
The "real" Flemish flag you are talking about is the one of the Belgian region of Flanders and is seen as equivalent by most
Those who don't want to use it see it as representative of excessive compromises in the past but few care that much since they view both as valid
Obviously VB as a separatist party opts for spreading the one which isn't an official flag within Belgium
Lol, those are some interesting identities for just 2 people
Yeah I have a Belgian flag where the yellow has the shape of a pint beer and the top is white instead of yellow
Thanks, didn't know that
Still, i'm convinced most of the people flying this flag don't know this either and just do it because it arrived in the little goody bag they got for signing up with VB and think it's edgy
Well, historically, for century this province was part of your duchy
I guess they didn't want to throw away that part of their history, it is litterally a chunk of what could have been part of your country added to our, just because of language
In a way, instead of being a "fuck you", it could be seen as respect for the past too : "yes, it's part of Belgium now, but historically, it's Luxembourg". This province has quite a distinct identity from the rest of Wallonia, based around the fact they are Ardennais before anything, they are really "proud" in that regard
Yeah, there is definitely going to be some overlap there
VB is being clever in that sense by giving their followers as many flags as possible
Means they can co-opt the Flemish movement
Well, thank you for these corrections and details :-)
My father-side grandparents are from Bertrix and the area, and my father spent a lot of time with his grandparents in Bertrix too (but grew up in Wavre), so, my little knowledge about said province come from that
But once I'll be able too, this is the province I want to visit the more : going back to Gouvy and Saint-Hubert, where I had my "classes vertes", and visiting Arlon and Bastogne are in my to-do list
[This picture of a stewardes after the suicidebomber attack in Brussels Airport on March 22 2016]
At the second place there is this shot after the [infamous assault  of the Bende van Nijvel on this Delhaize (November 9 1985)] along with every blurry picture of possible suspects
As the case hasn't been solved yet and it's doubtful that it will ever be solved
That's a very nice picture
Is the woman sitting next to him an ordinary woman
Our most famous pictures are probably from Ypres and the surrounding area in WW1
Or Saint-Paul's during the Blitz
It's iconic, but I think it held a much lesser impact on us
While understandable it is important to note that the Congo Free State wasn't under Belgian rule but under rule of the Belgian King (our government had no say in it, although they ha dmire say than the king when it comes to Belgium)
It's a big difference as we give power to the king but back then the king could be king of multiple countries, we only changed that after the Congo Free State
It is also important to note that the atrocities commited there were often done by corporations and private armies there, among which many weren't Belgian
Leopold II is at fault for never doing anything properly or significant against it, not because he activly supported it
(He made laws at the end of his rule (way too late) to counter it, but it didn't do much in practice
When Congo became an official Belgian colony thing started changing for the better (until ofcourse Belgium was under German rule and had no influence), but it was still a colony with us as the "superiors" which was still a majot wrong
But that could be said of every colony
Another important note is that even if we do consider Belgium and it's people responsible for the Congo Free State years instead of Leopold II, is that Belgium wasn't the only country doing atrocities in Africa at the time, just the one who got the media attention
(Boerwars with the genocide of the Boers in South Africa, Herero Wars and the Maji-Maji Rebellion from Germany with the Shark Island concentration camp etc
) You could argue that Congo was worse, as many more died there, and you would we definitely right
But on the other hand Congo didn't have actual deathcamps
That being said, even though a great majority of the Belgians at the time had got nothing to do with Congo Free State, it is stil a major black page in our history books
I would also like to say that by no means I'm trying to downplay or justify the atrocities in the Congo Free State, I'm only giving context about who is to blame and about other major crimes against humanity at the time
When I was a kid in the summer of 1993, I ran downstairs as usual on Sunday mornings to watch my favourite show "Samson en Gert". Unfortunately instead of my show we got news an extra news bulletin about the death of King Baudouin
I was not amused that my Sunday ritual was cancelled
I think what made me most scared was the images of Sabine and Laetitia being freed from Dutroux's basement
He had kidnapped, raped and murdered several girls before them and kept them in a dungeon behind a concrete door in his basement
I don't remember if it was the girls that were freed or the girls before them, but the police had already searched the house once and heard girls shouting
They didn't do anything then, only later were Sabine and Laetitia found alive
Also the investigating judge decided to let the guy go in another sexual delinquency case with minor girls
This case completely shook the core of Belgian politics
It also caused the disbandment of the Rijkswacht to form the unified Federal Police
I was too young to understand any of this, I was just shook on these girls in underwear being pulled from a fucking dungeon
I wasn't scared to go out at all but damn
Apparently, VT4 interrupted Pokémon for footage of 9/11
Oooh gertje koning boydewijn is brood zo
Dood samson , koning boudewijn is dood
It does not feel strange, but it’s very present being from Ieper with the whole Flanders fields thing
The endless stream of wartime stories my grandparents can tell are also a reminder that it wasn’t long ago
It makes me feel incredibly thankful to live now
> Mainly WWI and WWII
Do you have any idea how long we've been punching each other in the face before those two wars
It's not strange to me
But I'm just really grateful
My great grandfather fought in the war and it took until the age of 95 for him to start talking about it to us
And even then I know he avoided things
I never want anyone to have to go through that ever again
Also in terms of money the dutch also use 2 tons to indicate 200
000 this is very widely used
I have noticed
TIL steenwerp is an actual distance and not a figure of speech
In feudal Japan [yes, koku]
Ah yeah like that, sure
I mostly use the figure of speech in more relative terms
The distance between my home and the park is a stone's throw away to a local
Talking to someone from Russia about the distance between my town and Antwerp is also "a stone's throw" away even though it's like 40 km
So I use it more freely than just literally a short distance I guess
Idk how others (or you lovely folks up north) see it :)
I think I have that comic somewhere in the attic, I vaguely remeber that joke :D
Which Pantheon
The French or the Roman
it really is a wonderful place, very mysterious atmosphere inside if you ask me, and for some reason the triskelion on the wall really resonated with me, maybe just because it's weird to realise this ancient symbol has been on that wall for literally thousands of years
Why the fuck would you designate Auschwitz as a wonder
It's meant to be wonders in Europe
Used to believe belgian cuisine was boring, then I discovered how the Dutch eat and greatly appreciate our food
oh yeah
I love Norway and its towns, they are so beautiful
It's not that great sorry
It's maybe because it's so different from what i'm. used to here in Belgium
I was Røros last summer and found it to be really beautiful
Trondheim was also very beautiful and something completely different
I see, it's still not to bad
It looks like a normal village, which is fine :)
We got Panos in Belgium, which serves coffee and other drinks, sandwiches and some baked goods
I'd really like to see it grow outside of Belgium
Recently moved to Germany from Belgium
I really like Food Brothers (best burger I've ever had) & l'Osteria (giant thin crust pizzas for a really fair price)
I was in Kos Greece a long time ago and there was a pancake shack on the way to the beach and they made the most amazing crepes i have ever eaten, you could combine your own with the ingredients they had
I went there every day around noon
That guy diserves to have a chain world wide
I would die for proper fish and chips places here in Belgium
But every time I had some outside the UK I’ve regretted it
Absolutely the best
They are not that special and good and a bit on the expensive side,there are a lot better sandwich bars in Belgium
They got bought out by Burger King now
Altho it generally wasn't seen as a good chain, even lesser than McDonald's.
We have sandwich bars nearly on everycorner that aren't a chain, i just go to my local one a few streets from me
But for recommendations i don't know man, don't go to the ones in tourist places and you will be good
It’s basically individual local businesses
And yes there are a few really good ones
To pick the best one is however though
No, also keep in mind that a lot of people also use other e-mail providers for work related stuff
Specifically Outlook is used in a lot of work environments
No, in Belgian French we simply say "mail". In France I think they say "courriel".
Nope, not here
In fact, most people use other email providers, like outlook or the special email address of their job
No, we say gmail only when we want to be specific
There might be some boomers that are confused about it that say gmail though
Over here it's just "mail/e-mail".
I think hotmail/outlook are the biggest mail providers over here though, especially if you count them as one and the same
However a sizeable portion has a mailadress through their internet provider as well
Going by the 1500'ish costumers I have I don't see gmail that often here in Belgium
Actually I barely see it at all
I don't even think one has a majority position
My teachers say G-Mail but that's probably because we all got a g-mail adress from school
I was boring and used my actual name
I see, well, since you say "portable" instead of GSM and "texto" instead of SMS, it wouldn't have surprised me if you said courriel, since the only places where I see this word in on French medias
> It's the same thing for "texto" honestly
I haven't heard anyone use the word in years, everyone around me says SMS
Really
Where are you in France
Everytime I watch a French youtuber, a French movie or Tv show, they say texto
Belgium as an independent country (post-1830) :
France, the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and maybe Luxembourg
Belgium before its independence :
France, the Netherlands, Germany/HRE/Prussia, Spain and Austria
- France
- Netherlands
- Germany
- Austria
- Congo
Honorary mention to the UK for meddling as well
Well, I'll only talk modern countries and societies, because societies like the Roman Empire or Classical Greece are studied pretty much everywhere
The Netherlands (because of the lengthy history enjoyed together)
France, although a lot of attention is given to it in French classes rather than history classes
The USA, especially the post-WW2 years (we had to learn all the presidents since FDR and such)
The UK at some points during its history; especially during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian Age were given attention
Difficult one, could be either Spain (especially during the 16th-17th centuries), Germany (especially late 19th and early 20th century, to give perspective on both World Wars), Congo (as it was a former colony, isn't higher on the list because it only became part of our history around 1885, but should be) or  China (as it's a rising power)
Though to answer
Belgium was not really a nation until late, so we just learned the whole of European history in history class
France
the Netherlands
Germany/HRE
Austria
Spain
You should really add Congo to  the post-1830 list instead of Luxembourg
Luxembourg was just
around for most of the time but not more than that
Congo on the other hand
Belgium is older than modern Germany and Italy
I totally agree with you
Yes, but unlike those two, there is no group of states that can be considered the equivalent
They aren't completely banned here
I can still buy supply drops in Call of Duty (I think, I've never tried it) and Limited Event Packs in Rainbow Six Siege
But I can't buy FIFA Packs in FIFA 19
I think loot boxes were only banned from a few companies
They should get a gambling license
The problem is that it’s often young kids who buy those things, often not realizing that it costs actual money
My brother once spent €2000 on some games, not realizing he would have to actually pay real money for it
Kids can still get their hands on 16+ and 18+ games even without an adult
It's not like we banned lootboxes either, we simply require them to get a gambling license and implement an age check
Gaming companies simply have refused to do so which results in a de facto ban of lootboxes for everyone
Just because it's parents' responsibility to keep an eye on their children's spending habits, doesn't mean companies should be allowed to offer (and even promote/advertise) gambling services to children
Both parents can be more responsible and gaming companies can be told to adjust their software so that children don't have access to gambling mechanisms
They're not mutually exclusive
>Parents are the ones who are being negatively impacted by loot boxes
Imagine if beer companies and supermarkets started arguing that they shouldn't be disallowed from selling alcohol to kids under the age of 16
"It's the parents' responsibility that their kids don't drink until they end up in the gutter, not ours".
If the logic doesn't hold up for alcohol, why should it hold up for gambling
It's not like our gambling laws are new, they've been in place long before lootboxes were a thing
It just so happens that gaming companies tried to be slick and implemented a gambling mechanic without abiding by our gambling regulations
That's not how the world works
>in that sense it is easy to control whether or not they consume alcohol
Only if you as a parent check every single penny you ever give your child
Do you think it's healthy for teenagers to be under that much scrutiny of their parents
Personally, I think teenagers should have certain freedoms such as the freedom to spend their allowance as they see fit
Now, if I knew that my kid at age 10 would be free to buy as much alcohol as he wants with his weekly 5 euros then I'd be much more warry about giving him money to spend as he sees fit
So instead of a sensible measure (aka kids under the age of 16 shouldn't be drinking alcohol) and enforcing that as a country, you want us to turn the financial side of our children into a police state where every parent accounts for all the money their children have so that they don't buy alcohol
There's a reason why nobody likes libertarian policies because they ignore pragmatic sensible solutions in favor of utopian societies where magically everyone will behave as a responsible citizen/parent as opposed to realistic solutions
Kids can start earning money in Belgium at 16, but minimum wage (like, 5-8€/h)
Doesn't mean they should start out with debts
I think they don't know how gambling addictions work :')
Username checks out
I can't speak for all European parties but aren't most green parties already single-issue-parties already
The way I indentify myself is situational, i.e. when I'm in another part of Belgium I'll identify myself as being from this region/town
When I'm in another EU nation I'll identify as Belgian and when I'm in the US I'll feel more European
So yeah there are 'components' but they'll come out depending on where I am
'Samson en Gert' is a Belgian tv series for children which also has unlimited meme potential
We have a subreddit called r/Belgica and we turn the flag 1 degree everyday there is no government formed
For Belgium: writing in our national language, belgicaans, which is a mix of dutch, french and german
Let's not forget neurchi de félixibilisation du marché du travail (flexibility of the labour mark)
Some memes are good there but I just like the name so much
Ricardo sa pinto also, in a game they throw a cup of beer on his foot and he acted like it was made of concrete and was laying on the field just to spill time
Oh god did you ever see those psychedelic hardstyle crazy as fuck youtube remixes all glitched out
I know it sounds weird if you never saw it but I can't really describe it any other way
Also, how can you forget about Donal Muyle
'Wij makn uw keukn in België'
Also, r/BELGICA is a meme subreddit where we speak in our three official languages at once
Das ziet er comme ça aus
I'm just dropping [this] here
"Samson (talking dog) vs
Gert (the guy)", by Studio Massa, who I believe is Dutch actually
The guy stopped because it took too long and there was a temporary government formed for the pandemic
Funny
I have never really thought of us as being close haha
I suppose in Flanders we feel closer to the Netherlands because of the language
We share **a** language
The majority of our country speaks another one ;)
Most of us, if not all, would argue the Netherlands is our best bro
Considering how historically, Belgium and the Netherlands have for the most part been tied together, we share a lot of our history and are therefore similar countries with fond relations . Our Benelux alliance is older than the EU and still stands today
Even our militaries often operate directly together
In Belgium I would have said that our bros are more Luxembourg and Netherlands than France
Sorry
Ah lovely that you are finally admitting you like us ️
Culture-wise I would say Belgium (including Flanders) is often a lot closer to France or the Romance world than the Netherlands
This can be partially explained by the fact that we are Catholic instead of those hardcore protestants in the Netherlands
Even in this secular day and age the cultural divide with the Netherlands still feels a lot bigger than the one with France
Interesting view
As a Belgian, I considered the Netherlands more closely aligned to Germany with your brutal honesty, protestant sobriety, strong sense of organization and so on
What would you consider similar between Belgium and (some parts of) Germany
This feeling is, to my experience, most often not reciprocated by Flemings
Some are separatist but even among them, the notion of joining the Netherlands is a really marginal thought
I too, think those Dutchmen underestimate the cultural divide that exists between Belgium and the Netherlands
I feel like we're even polar opposites on quite a lot of issues, which makes me feel even more at home in France or, to a lesser extent Germany
These deep differences have been growing since at least the eight-year's war
You have some differences between Flemings and Walloons too but they do not come even near to the differences between us Flemings and you the Dutch imo
I don't know why so many Dutch like to say that
I think part of it is because they often don't know us so well as we know them as the much bigger entity
Another part, I feel, is sadly often because the Dutch feel culturally superior and imperialistic, and think they should make some kind of Anschluss of the 'lost provinces', thereby ignoring that Belgium has any culture of its own or appropriating our culture
I'm not accusing you of that to be clear (I actually agree with what everything you said), I'm just saying that those Dutchmen exist and are omnipresent on the internet whenever Belgium is mentioned
Something by which I can get pretty annoyed to be frank
Also, pro tip: if you happen to drop by in Belgium, always welcome but do not call us Dutch (or French for that matter), it will likely come over as rude
For the rest, I do like you Dutchies and I am certainly up for a close Benelux cooperation, just acknowledging that we are not quite the same (even in the countries themselves there's a lot of diversity which you also already alluded at with your post), and that all regions have their own merit (not that the Netherlands or the Holland region is superior to everything else)
Kind greetings from your Southern neighbour
EDIT: mainly my bad English
I second this, you explained it perfectly
I agree with that
Basically :
-Portugese people can understand Spanish fairly easily, it's not that easy the other way around though
-Italians can understand Spanish and I guess it would be pretty much the same for Spanish speakers to understand Italian
-Excluding Romanian, French is probably the hardest to understand from speakers of other romance languages
And Romanian can pretty much be summed up like this :
-Other romance languages : Hey Romanian
Are you one of us
-Romanian : *da*
Asteûr le wèlon de Tcharlerwè, y'a pu pon de djint pou l'parlêr !
Some counties in Belgium (mostly rural ones) have the tradition of shooting carbide guns
It's a sort of metal rack (pipes) where you poor in some chemical stuff and you hit it with a heavy hammer
It make a very VERY loud bang
Can go on for the entire night in some cases
Luckily injuries are pretty rare
I'm really late but here goes
In Belgium we play [Les lacs du Connemara and wave/dance with our napkins
Well the actual Belgian flag has horizontal lines and is particularly similar to the German one
Interesting fact is that in the constitution the flag remains horizontal and that has never been changed since the revolution
So if we follow our constitution, we've been using the wrong flag now for around 180 years
How Belgian is that
As far as I know the constitution didn't mention the direction of the stripes or the order of the colors
They do say red, yellow, black but don't specify that that is a fixed order, so us being Belgians of course we'll go the exact opposite way
> Article 193:
>De Belgische Natie kiest als kleuren rood, geel en zwart, en als rijkswapen de Belgische Leeuw met de kenspreuk EENDRACHT MAAKT MACHT
>La Nation belge adopte les couleurs rouge, jaune et noire, et pour armes du Royaume le Lion Belgique avec la légende : L'UNION FAIT LA FORCE
>Die Belgische Nation wählt die Farben Rot, Gelb und Schwarz und als Wappen des Königreichs den Belgischen Löwen mit dem Spruch: EINIGKEIT MACHT STARK
I know that the first Belgian flags had horizontal lines, but unless it's mentioned somewhere else in the constitution I don't think they have to be horizontal
Btw: Happy cake day
Red Lion with the white and blue stripe ? [The best one]
I actually prefer that one because Arlon/Arel has the same one/similar
Why put an Albanian eagle
Why not have you own identity as Kosovans
Only country in the world to do that  so proud
Scotland technically still is
As soon as I started working I started paying a contribution to the household budget yeah
At that point your parents no longer get money from the government for supporting you and it's only fair that you pay something for having a place to live and food
Definitely not unheard of
I didn't have to, but a lot of my peers did have to pay a kind of rent after getting a job and still living at home
Usually more a token tribute, but a friend of mine has to fork over 50% of his pay
His parents like the cashcow, and are making it difficult for him to move out/guilting him into staying (and paying)
Yes it is, I have no problem with it because renting is still more expensive than living at home where I am paying 200 euro a month, as a contribution to household costs
Not common at all and seriously weird
Personally my parents were like "just safe all the money you make with your job and buy yourself a place
I left home when I had saved up 100k basically and instead of those 30-40 years types of thing I'll have my apartment paid off in 10
Not something everyone can do obviously but it's not like I wouldn't have chipped in if they had financial trouble
My entire family is basically based on helping each other out
I helped them a lot just not in financial ways
Literally my sister
My parents were very generous and did not want me to contribute financially
My sister is lazy as fuck, basically taking advantage of that and the free meals
She's had a job for almost five years now without lifting a finger around the house
Like, good for her that she can save a fuckton of money, but I don't like her straining my already older and tired parents
Same in Belgium
For a couple of years now, there have been sightings of a wolf couple in our country and even talks of them having cubs, but hunters and farmers (and simpletons) are afraid of them and don’t want them
Which is sad and pathetic
And then you have Flemish Dutch which shares the same grammar and vocabulary but everything means something else
And 'Dutch sounds like drunken German' is also a common one
> we have guttural and nasal sounds which can be off-putting for some
Especially in France, that's how we can spot you in Belgium : because of how nasal and higher-pitched many French people speak
Someone once told me Dutch is just German for dummies
[Maybe it's the other way around
Love your username btw
Belgian Dutch is the one without coughing up sandpaper
i like this metaphor for the gooische r
Thanks Italy for the food
Thank you France for giving us a decent law system, and for being the cultural giant that you are
France will always have a special place in my heart because of their help during our independence struggle
Thanks French bros
Except our roads, they are terrible
I don't like putting them on top of a hot cup, they always get mushy because of the steam
But thanks for the coaster tip that seems like a fix to my issue
When I'm at home never
When I'm gone for just a second I also leave it unlocked
But then again I've got a dog walking around
I barely bother at night honestly but that's mostly because money is of little importance to me
IF I get robbed because I left the back door open it doesn't really matter to me
During the day, especially in summer, there is a good change you can just walk through the backdoor
Edit: Going by what Americans(and Austrians for some reason) said I'll repeat what most Europeans know
Front door is locked by default without a key(or as we use, a code, no need to mess with keys for me, haha)
And actually LOCKing the front door just doesn't happen
Maybe if we go on holiday, if we think about it
Hotel doors seem to be the best example here yea

Prety much the same but I thought some things different
Meejd
The death of Slovakian in a police cell several years ago
Apparently all was caught on camera and the images only just leaked a few months ago
On the images you can see a female officer imitating Hitler
After going over these news items, we Redditors thought were popular subjects in our own countries, I wonder where I could have learned about all this using another Internet entry point
Can we make this a recurring item ? Reading all this is a learning experience that I think is essential for a person to be able to form an opinion about his environment
Because last time you won the WC the country was so calm
I think those police agents still work for the police witch is also pretty terrible
It's under full investigation
Media had gone silent for a bit because of lack of new info, but it is being looked into
Covid is still the number 1 topic though
Election season in the US is high on the list too
The media was quit about it for a while but the women who did the nazi salute just came out whit her side of the story so its back in the news
Internationally it's KU Leuven, but as long as you stay inside Belgium, your employer most likely won't care
I think the universities here are very homogenous and teach about the same stuff
but for the so called "Top" I will have to go with the University of Ghent and the Catholic University of Leuven
In Belgium, it mostly depends on what you’re studying, each have their own specialities, but for example for medicine, the big-ones all have their own specialisations
But in general, both Antwerp and Hasselt University are probably less prestigious
When it comes to that, it’s down to the KUL/UGent/VUB/ULB
People who went to KUL tend to care
In the international rankings, Ugent is on top with KU Leuven shortly behind
The others aren't even in the ranking
I've studied both at the UGent and UAntwerpen
Maybe UGent is more prestigious but I found the quality of teaching much better at UAntwerpen
I also have a friend who went to get an extra degree (in bio-informatics) at the KUL
He found the level of his professors at the UAntwerpen to be much better than at the KUL
UHasselt is mostly low in prestige due to it catering more towards a different teaching/learning style and a huge lack of masters degrees and phd's
Does anyone maybe know what uni is best for languages
They're usually all in the ranking, just not the top 100
Sometimes KUL tops as well
Age of the university is a factor in those rankings, and makes it harder for young universities to get as ‘high’ as the older universities in Belgium
That’s why there are separate rankings for younger universities (e.g. QS 50 under 50, with multiple Belgian universities)
Prestige is mostly determined by achievements of your alumni
UA is relatively young university so their alumni haven't been able to do too much
I think it's mostly due to it being very young, they still need to find their niche market
I think this might depend on the languages themselves
If you want to study Sinology (Chinese) in Flanders, I'd recommend KU Leuven over UGent
I went to UGent but I heard in KU Leuven you get more of a choice if you want to focus more on thr language or more on the cultural aspects
While studying in UGent I met a few students who did Sinology at KU Leuven and I felt like their Chinese language level was generally better
For other languages I have no idea
Might be an unpopular opinion but I'd say the UK is one of the least interesting ones
It could be because it's so present in pop culture and basically anywhere in the world you go you'll find the UK (food, music, movies, language, people) that there's nothing new to see there
Luxembourg is like what Belgium would be if it had competent leaders
Clean streets, beautiful nature, good economy, ...
Well I don't know what your specific interests are but I always thought we had a little bit of everything on offer
In terms of gastronomy the Belgian cuisine is often described as a mix between French quality and German quantity while still maintaining its own character ofcourse
I'd also say we're a pretty interesting country for the beer lover
History-wise the regions of Flanders and Brabant were extremely rich regions through trade during the Middle Ages and frontrunner of the Northern renaissance
This lasted until the Fall of Antwerp in 1585 after which the centre of artistic and scientific innovation moved north to the Netherlands
Later on Belgium was the first country on the continent to engage in the Industrial Revolution rendering us a big economic power once again and creating and attracting lots of influential figures (f.e. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote their Communist Manifesto in Café le Cygne on Brussels' Grand Place) until the Germans dismanteled our entire industry in the first World War and moved it to Germany
In terms of nature we don't have anything extravagant like the Alps or the Mediterranean but the Ardennes are pretty neat I guess
Very nice place for a hike, rock climbing, canoeing, cave exploration et cetera
So like I said, nothing crazy, but quite a rich history, good food, and some nice nature
The weather is pretty shit I guess
If you're into beer, there's the smorgasbord of beer types, brands and flavors, I think unchallenged by any other country (and I'm not talking craft beers, but mainstream ones)
There is also the mix of French/Dutch/German cultures and languages
You'll also find many things (that people don't think much about but still) that were invented here, some with their own small town/village, like duffel bags, spas, the saxophone, house music, and fries

There is more to Belgium than beer, fries and chocolate
Manneken pis isn't the best thing at all
I don't even know why that thing is a tourist hotspot
Besides the feeling of seeing everything that's in the UK anywhere in the world you go, or even home
Iceland is the best place to see/study/visit the legacy of Old Norse/Norsemen (misnamed "Viking" in mainstream medias) culture though
Thanks to their isolation, it was more preserved there
Who hates you
Belgians
I assure we do not
We only hate The Dutch, French, Germans, Americans and Brits
Also the Dutch
This tbh
We are kinda not as popular are our german, dutch and french neighbours but we do have a lot to offer other than the small statue
Other than amazing beers and fries, we have beautiful cities like Gent or Dinant
Amazing party life, if youre into it, because i know most of us are
I don't know why everyone thinks our accent is adorable
It's just better than Dutch accent is all I know
In fact it gets worse
Flanders is both a region and a community but its territory depends on the relevant policy
Well, in that case I correct myself and not say UK but England
Haha, I can totally understand
Hou uw bek, schijtfransoos
Too bad I moved here with two kids
I missed the whole nightlife scene
Where is it best
That's why I said "if".
Yeah but again, those hundreds or thousands of beer styles are mostly craft beers or independent breweries whose beer you can't find easily, or are overpriced
In the typical US bar you'll find Bud and the same watered-down beers
Thats because you're so neatly packed together, just like the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourgh are
Well im still 22 and a student so most my fun times are in Gent & Brussels near uni
Surely lots of bars and club everywhere that are so much fun
What
Did you say something about Belgium's backyard
^i ^think ^so, ^this ^is ^how ^you ^are ^supposed ^to ^be ^patriotic
Okay now you crossed a line pal
We were just joking around, why would you say something so hurtful
You'd better, it's the only reason Belgians have guns anymore
Lol no but seriously I wouldnt know why he would get triggered other than for shits and giggles
We laugh at that expression (because we know we can make them better than the French ;) )
Same, but thats because i see fries and waffles as standard
"*This is the shit
*" or "*X is the shit
In English, it means something is great, in French, shit (*merde*) is always associated with something negative
Culturally, I don't understand how/why it means something positive in English, since feces are the most disgusting thing in the world
Saying "*Ça c'est la merde !*" or "*X est la merde !*" would means something is bad
In Dutch exactly the same
Same but depending on the tone you pronounce 'please' with
However, *Merde !* (*shit*), or *Bonne merde !* (*good shit*), are positive expression in french
'Frikadelbroodje' wtf even is that lol
I'm guessing it's what we call a 'worstenbroodje'. And I don't even know what 'een tikkie' is
Where in Belgium
Never heard any francophone use *merde* that way
In Liège, it's to wish good luck to someone
I've heard countless time *Bonne merde !* before taking a school exam
Edit: [Here is some references; Interjection 2 & 3]
I knew it
(North) Brabant is officially the best part of the Netherlands
But what does 'een tikkie' mean
Oh, yes, but the logic behind this is : you say *merde* instead of *chance* because : superstition says that the opposite of what you wish will happen
So, saying *chance*  would bring *malheur*, so you wish something bad instead
It's like PayConiq/Bancontact in Belgium
In the French part of Belgium, we have a socialist party called the PS
They have been in office for years, except for the last 5 and there where a lot of skeletons that came out of the closet
For example, they bought tanks in 200* that had a barrel that didn’t comply with the EU standard
Only one factory in Belgium made ammo for that, FN Herstal
Which is property of the French speaking government in Belgium (where the PS still reigns) and the minister of defence of that time, was a socialist (PS) who’s hometown was the town where FN Herstal was located
They still sell a lot of guns to Saoudi Arabia, which sells them to muslims extremist parties
Oh and the tanks from 200* still haven’t fired a single round because they still haven’t been able to get the ammo to comply properly
PSA: you can check the "official" perceived corruptness of your country on this website:
EDIT: A word
Our biggest problem is not having a goverment that is devoted to keeping the country together
Frankly we don't have a goverment at all, what is probably for the best
In Belgium much of the corruption is hidden
It shows up if you have an activity and want to build, licenses, produce, permits
I don’t doubt that there is corruption in our country actually I won’t be surprised that it’s in every country
Everywhere there is money there are scumbags who want more
We had a lot of cases of abuse of resources,tax money and private meetings with project developers
There are a few bad apples that’s true
But I don’t think out institutions or system is corrupt as a whole
I absolutely despise the PS but it's pretty naive to think they're the only ones in the corruption boat
A good example is Alain Mathot
One of the most corrupted men of the PS and who did save his arse by voting against the lifting of his parliamentary immunity
The NVA
No surprise, we're doing worse than our neighbours except France
Most of switzerland uses German though
Unless you visit French speaking region of switzerland, that french won't be useful
Oh, I did not know about that bit of story !
Very interesting, I actually go fairly often in Switzerland in the french speaking part in the Vaud, 1hour away from Lausanne :)
r/AskEurope now has 40000 subscribers
Fuck you for putting Pachelbel on there (I’m a cellist )
Living in the capital:
Endless roadworks, the air smells bad, people tend to ignore the other people, everything's close so it's super pratical, very nice public transportation system, a lot of car traffic, a lot of green parks and a huge one that's nearby a whole forest (Bois de la cambre and the forest De Soigne) so nature is very accessible which is nice to take a break from the city, very nice architecture in the middle of ugly ones, a lot of cultural things to do,great restaurants scene even though it's still lacking of more specific asian cuisine other than just sushi,thai and basic chinese
I live in Brussels and I'm very happy about it
Public transport is great in non-COVID times
And anything I could ever need is accessable
I've been to many European capitals and I love most of them, but nothing compares to Brussels in terms of night life and bars
We have so many awesome old and authentic bars which serve such variety in Belgian beers, it's heavenly
A great workday is one where I get up, walk my daughter to school and then walk to work (picking up an espresso on the way at my local bakery)
I do my work, which I enjoy, and meet up with friends at a bar (it works when my wife picks up my daughter from school)
A good evening is where I get home late, obviously not every day
In the weekend I spend time with my family playing boardgames, reading books, taking walks and relaxing in the park
A high speed train network across all of Europe with super modern trains that all have a similar theme
A network of high quality, railway like bicycle infrastructure for long-distance cycling
Something like the Ravel-network in Wallonia, these are great because they use disused tram- and railway tracks which means light slopes, connecting towns and villages, many bridges and tunnels and practical widths
We could alternatively also place them next to existing railways, rivers, and channels
We should prioritise cyclists at all minor road-crossings and assign each long route a clear name/code
It would just be the best, easiest to ride cycle network, on which you would almost never need to stop if you aren't in a major city
In the future,  with cheaper electric bikes and the knowledge that every faraway place has a nice and easy to follow path to take you there
This would be pretty attractive to a wider audience than we may now imagine
Maybe
Just maybe, un-do an infrastructure ?
I mean
Get rid of the tunnel across the Channel ?
They want to be by themselves anyway
Let them
An affordable high speed train network would be nice
Right now, if you have a car, a partner and a few kids, it is often "cheaper" to take the car
I don't know how feasable this is, but a bridge between Helsinki and Tallinn would be way better geopolitically
It would allow the EU to block off Saint Petersburg from the rest of the Baltic sea, and making supplying Kallinningrad impossible for the Russians in case of war
We have begun creating [national "bicycle" highways (fietsostrades/fietssnelwegen)] connecting major cities
Not all are finished, but the idea is that one might cycle between cities with minimal roadcrossings
Love for this to expand internationally as well
Vlad P, who lives in Moskou, would see his main access to the oceans blocked by dams
He's never going to accept his
Yeah travelling by train is so much easier and more comfortable than travelling by car or plane
I feel like a lot more people would travel to places further away that they otherwise wouldn't travel to
That's exactly what I had in mind
Or something like [this] but it would be weird to see a train with the Estonian flag in Spain for example
All the same with the flag of the EU or all have the national flag of a country
Check out Antwerp station
It's a beautiful 19th century station, but it's been upgraded to service high speed trains and has had a huge capacity increase, all with respect to the old building
You could make the bridge go up so the shipping routes can stay open
It's just a lot easier to block of a few gates under the bridge than a whole sea
But I agree that naval batteries would probably be a much cheaper solution
Well that just sounds amazing
We better get these quick
Yeah that really sucks
Maybe a railway from Tallinn to Helsinki could work
Yeah you're right
And not just national flags, also regional ones
Imagine a train with the Welsh dragon
I mean, airplanes are basically subsidized do maybe someone should just do that to trains instead and see how far that gets us before looking at the rest of the costs
Yes, and they even built a big bridge over the Strait of Kertch, which is admitedly a lot shorter, but by doing so have made the Ukranian city of Mariupol a lot more reliant on that bridge not being blocked
Maaaaaybe they want to cooperate with the EU
Many people here rather wish Charleroi didn't exist
In my city in Belgium we have a saying that translates to "Antwerp is the city, the rest is parking"
Albert, Leopold, Philip, Baudoin
Sucks to be a new country
We'd have: Leopold, Leopold, Albert, Leopold, Boudewijn, Albert and Filip
For the Queens we have: Paola, Fabiola, Mathilde and a few other that I don't know and i'm too lazy to search
Leo would be a safe choice
Bo would be possible too
Not a great choice
3 times Leopold, which would likely be a faux-pas considering the second's actions in Congo
2 times Alhert, one Filip and one Boudewijn
You're shit out of luck if you're a girl, but if Filip abdicates soon, girls could be named Elisabeth
Well, if we can also use predecessor states maybe we have more people
The burgundian dukes for example; Karel, Jan, names like that
And if you wait long enough, you can name your daughter Elisabeth
My name is actually Elisabeth, so that would be fun
yeah but was burgundy belgium ?
you can't argue for it, but you can argue against it
>I've seen people have a "my life is a lie" type of reaction when they first found out
This was me when I found out that Joey is actually learning French with Phoebe and not Spanish
When I was presented with the choice of learning Spanish or German, I thought to myself: which would give me the best traveling experiences
The answer is dos cervezas por favor and me speaking in Rammstein lyrics to Germans
Actually it's "Zwieber".
Yeah, but the guy you responded to apparantly can't form one Dutch sentence without letting slip in some English
"How" should be "hoe". Probably autocorrect if I have to guess, because "How" is for some reason capitalised as well
Also the sentence structure isn't grammatically correct
/Grammar n*zi out
In Belgium we dont even need an opinion to divide the population lol
Among French speakers, the gender of “COVID”.
It was “le covid“ (masculine form) for the longest, then by the end of last year, a “la” agenda arrived out of nowhere
Now every now and then, you’ll hear someone (mainly journalists) say “la covid” (feminine form), sowing confusion and sparking debates among those who raised their eyebrows upon hearing it
Well but that's clearly because of the socialists/walloons/Flemish nationalists/antwerpians/people who shop at aldi/bmw drivers/vegans/recreational cyclists/virologists/MeToo movement/unions/company cars/muslims/priests/covid restrictions/education system/government/road network/landlords
sauce on the fries or in a little plastic jar
And in Belgium it's frieten
Just frieten or fritten
Learn to use plural , cheaseheads
I've never seen Schlagobers when I was in Austria, menus always call it Sahne
Granted, I went almost exclusively for skiing holidays, so maybe they use Sahne for tourists
That's some fucked up shit ngl
A patat is a potato and nothing else
It would be like calling a sword iron
A tractor is used by farmers, teenage guys are trekkers
wow didn't even realise haha, thanks
I'd say it's more between jupiler and stella artois (where I live)
But it's not on the same level, a jupiler person wouldn't say stella is crap
Those damn Belgians
They ruined Belgium
if you say it with a nasty Antwerp accent the 'frietje' problem will go away, though your fellow Dutchies probably won't understand you
1 friet 3 frieten da is gwn logica
En kwni wa er mis is me onze mayo
ah didn't know, I'm from the Antwerp region
I like jupiler more, but stella seems to be the most popular here (atleast in my social circle)
Nobody takes us seriously, we're that unthreatening neighbour
If you want any kind of career you have to go to Brussels
In the south we rely on the French to provide our entertainment (we watch all French TV shows, movies, etc
) and (albeit it's a shameful secret of ours) pretty much identify as French
There are very little things someone could point out as being constitutive of "belgian culture" (waffles, beer, fries, ridiculously complex politics
Truly Belgium feels even smaller because we're also split in two with the language border
Wallonia (the southern, French speaking part of Belgium) has less than 4 million people
Going to Flanders (the northern part) kind of feels like going abroad
There are maybe 2-3 cities, the rest are honestly just towns
It's a little boring
Watching other countries' national tv channels on the regular
I can't imagine a French person watching belgian national tv
Many people in Belgium don't even know what you luxembourgers are up to
You're actually right on many points :)
This is all very subjective of course
Hope no one takes offense in my strong opinions :p
It's a very unpopular opinion of mine so do not be surprised if a lot of walloons swear the opposite :p
Don't get me started on that with Belgium
Yes, Belgium is the capital of Brugge
1) Luxembourg borders the least densely populated part of our country, which limits cross-border interaction with most of Belgium's population
2) Luxembourg is a small, stable and rich democracy
Basically everything the media thinks is uninteresting
3) Luxembourg media is completely absent, at least in Flanders
I can't immediately think of a single television show, film or song that I would link to Luxembourg
I just watched a trailer on youtube of Superjhemp retörns and I think the humour is very relatable
A leopard is called a "luipaard" in dutch
Translated to english it literally says "Lazy Horse"
I'm Belgian so I speak Dutch:
Nijlpaard (nile horse) - Hippo
Roofvogel (robbery bird) - Bird of prey
Jachtluipaard (hunting leopard) - Cheetah
Luipaard (lazy horse) - Leopard
Neushoorn (nose horn) - Rhino
Kakkerlak (pooper-varnish) - Cockroach
Ijsbeer (ice bear) - Polar Bear
Veelvraat (eat-a-lot) - Wolverine
Das (tie) - Badger
Doodskopaapje (death head monkey / "skull monkey) - Squirrel monkey
Schoenbekooievaar (shoe-beak-stork) - Shoebill
Zeekoe (sea cow) - Manatee
Walvis (shore fish) - Whale
Potvis (jar fish) - Sperm Whale
There a lot more tho
As usual, 90% of this list also applies to Dutch
The original words are different, but when literally translated they end up the same
> "orsetto lavatore" which lterally means "little washer bear".
We call him raton laveur (little washing rat) in French
in dutch it's Nile Horse, pretty close
For Belgium, I would say Dos Cervesas from Tom Waes
That one was very popular a few years back
Zoutelande by BLØF, was popular at the same time as well I think
I think you know this song
>level 1thewinberg SwedenScore hidden · 2 hours agoThe year was 2004
The world had been conquered by a crazy blue frog
You could say Avicii
Lais: 't smidje
But internationally famous
Call me old but I would say  [Technotronic - pump up the jam] or [2 unlimited - no limit]
[Danzel with Pump it up]  is/was also really popular .
yup, this one
Even more than blue
And "anton aus tirol"
Yes, as a folk party song that one absolutely takes the cake, but as an equivalent to Despacito I think Dos Cervesas is more fitting
Poland is obsessed with this song
Don't remind me of that nightmare
The description OP gave didn't imply it had to be a *bad* song
And tbf it's all subjective
Not the first austrian you say such things about
#Not functioning or not finished
##Buildings
- In 1975, the city of Leuven gained permission to build a new hospital wing with 622 new beds
The building structure was finished in 1983, but the inner building was never finished, except for the lower floor, due to a change in hospital policies from the government
Since it cannot be used for other means, it will be demolished again
##Railways
- 2
3 km of the premetro tunnel structures of Antwerp are built between 1977 and 1986, but was never used
In 2006, the government used 100 meters of those tunnels for the new tram line 5
- There is a ghost station at Metro line 2 in Brussels, named Sainctelle, never used due how close to the two neighboring stations were
- There is ra 2
5 km long metro tunnel at Liège underneath the Quai Saint-Léonard for a never-built metro line
##Road works
- A tunnel at Antwerp under the Fr
Roosevelt place and the Tenier place
It will never be in use due to the long slope necessary for driving out of such a deep tunnel; being too long to fit in the current traffic plan
In 2019, part of it was repurposed as an underground car parking near a premetro station
- At Harelbeke, the ring road around the city of Kortrijk was never finished due to money problems
Because of that, there is a dead end 2 by 2 lane bridge over the river Lys
- [A bridge for a 2 by 2 lane road at Strépy-Bracquegnies] The four lane road would circle around the north of the centre of Thieu
##Water works
- The channel Ieper-Komen
The purpose was to connect the Yser river at Ypres with the Leie at Lys river
A channel bridge was necessary at Hollebeke
The works started at 1864, but couldn't be finished, even after multiple tries, due to the weak earth in the area
Now, the channel only runs up to Yper itself
- The channel Ourthe
The purpose was to connect the Meuse river at Liège with the Lys
The construction started at 1827 under command of Dutch king Willem I. With Belgium becoming independent at 1830, the political climate changed
At that time, people were constructing the part of the channel with the tunnel at Bernistap, which should be about 2
5 km long, but work on the tunnel ceased
It's only built for 1
1 km and that's where the channel stops
#Functions, but questioning if it's proven useful
- Premetro at Charleroi: There were 8 arms planned, and from those, 3 were built and used
A fourth is almost built, but is only used for the education of tram drivers
- The [cable-stayed bridge near Hasselt] over the Albert channel, as part of a never used connection between the cities of Hasselt and Genk
Originally planned as a two by two road, now used as a residential road
*(Note: I live near there
In the original plan, it would cut through a nature reserve, now it makes a sharp bend at the south of the channel instead, as seen here:
>Also in the bigger picture of connecting the provincial capital of Hasselt and the nearby highway with its northern surroundings, the big 2 by 2 highway-like road in the north of the province bottlenecks to a 2 lane road in the busiest part; a change has been part of a debate for the last 30 years, and we're still no further than just some possible plans
Part of it runs through a city centre whose merchants aren't all too happy with losing potential customers if a ring road or a tunnel would be built, and part of the road runs bordering
a nature reserve
- A double viaduct near Sint-Truiden has ever been proposed for a highway expansion between the city of Tienen and the Dutch city of Maastricht
One viaduct and 1
5 km of highway road has been built
The actual highway itself never came, but the 1
5 km highway road between the two bridges can still be used to travel between a major road and a residential road
#Didn't function, but has a new useful destination
- The A1 highway between Brussels and Antwerp has a 40 meter wide space in the middle of the road for a future built super highway with only one off-ramp between Brussels and Antwerp
The super highway never came, and the space has been reclaimed to build a forest in recognition for all who died in road accidents, and a fast railway connection
- The lubrication pipe next to the Albert channel costed 125 million euro, and was meant to transport dirty water from the chemical industry at Tessenderlo to the Scheldt river
Because of construction mistakes, it never functioned that way, and in the '90s it was rebuilt for the transport of drinking water
#Didn't function, and has eventually been broken down
- Euroshopping Mechelen: A shopping centre in the city centre with a parking tower, shops, a city banquet hall, and restaurants
Built in the '60s, never functioned
Shops were always empty, the parking tower was in a bad state, and the city banquet hall was only sporadically used
The building has been destroyed and instead, a residential area has been built
Source and more, but I'm not going to type over and translate the entire Wikipedia article:  (Though feel free to click the link for some pretty pictures
The [Oosterweelverbinding] a project that's been "in the making" for over 20 years now
It should complete the ring around Antwerp, with construction finally started in 2019, they plan to finish everything in 2026
The new national football stadium
It was supposed to be built for the Euro 2020
If I remember correctly, Anderlecht was supposed to rent it if it wasn't used by out national football team
But they pulled out of the agreement
Then there were problems with *where* it could be build
They didn't get a permit from the givernment to build it at the wanted location
Result: we're not one of the hosting countries anymore of Euro 2020 and I don't think it's ever going to be build
Also the renovation of the Justice Palace
It started in 2003, and it has taken so long that even the scaffolding that are used for the renovation need reparations
Over de tuikabelbrug en waarom er zoveel andere overbodige projecten waren:
Vroeger, rond '60 werden verkeersdeskundigen, of ingenieurs indertijd, betaald in vormen van betonpremies
Hoe meer beton er lag, hoe meer ze betaald werden
Een van de tactieken dat ze gebruikten om de regering te overtuigen meer wegen te bouwen was om eerst zogenaamde kunstwerken neer te planten, dit zijn bruggen, tunnels, knooppunten, enz
om daarna te vragen aan de regering: "De bruggen en tunnels liggen er al
Het zou dom zijn om daar geen wegen op aan te sluiten
Een tactiek die nu (na jaren '90) niet meer mogelijk is; en met dank: de betonpremie werd eindelijk afgeschaft en de regering wilt nu eerst alles plannen en daarna pas beginnen met bouwen
Aan de andere kant: alles plannen betekent dat vertragingen heel lang kunnen uitlopen
Bron: verteld door docent verkeerskunde aan de hogeschool waar ik student was
It's too the same case in Wallonia with rail stations of Liège Guillemins and Mons( always not finished though)
Overrated architect
It seems like no one gives a damn, tourists are still rolling in here in Brussels
The only thing I notice is that I’m one of the only people when I go to Chinese restaurants or Asian supermarkets
Oh well, I love to shop and eat in peace anyway
Also they recently cancelled an Anime convention because of Corona, which makes me both laugh and cringe
Not that I'm aware of no
I don't think so
If they have, I haven't heard of it
To me, it always seems like what defines a lot of people in this country is apathy
Not only now but even in general
To be fair, our government had the most ingenious solution to the whole problem
If we don't test anyone, no one in our country is sick
Done
What a lovely day
In seriousness I think it's got to be pretty severe (or just football), for a Belgian to give a shit
I mean they wanted to split the country and most of us were like "eh, whatever".
Beautiful by sound rather than meaning:
Hungarian: hogy (that)
Dutch: fluim (phlegm)
Icelandic: fljúga (fly)
Bulgarian: флюс (flux)
I prefer this one:
##Schmetterling
Kinda like "smijten" in Dutch :)
In Dutch it is a "Vlinder", but in all seriousness "Papillon" is the most beautiful word that I know for the species
Yeah, but it's more menacing if you curse it or if you say it in such a way as if it scares you more than anything
We have "gooien", "werpen" en "smijten". The first is the regular throwing
The second is also throwing but more like the sence of throwing discs or javelins, so throwing somethign far away
The third is throwing something hard and not as careful
So I guess it could be either of those depending on context
The first one not so much
I just think of that pig with his unitard in the movie Sing
American-sounding names, like Kevin, Britney etc
Names ending in -y (are often American names)
Very old names, like Yvonne, Mariette, Roland etc
Names from the Netherlands, like Sjoerd, Gerri, Trui etc
Jack
I love the name for a dog, but I don’t like it on a person
Kevin for a man, what is seen as an unattractive name apparently
I had a guy in my class called "Geronimo" and a girl named "Pricilla", also "senia" pronounced like xeniia
These are based only on the fact I'm a Romance-speaker, and thus I base myself on the beauty standards of said languages
No offense is meant to people having these names, which are from another language family

I think Sterre is kinda okay but if you name your kid Puck you want that she is beaten up
Which is of course the use of a Puck anyway
In Belgium also
You literally copy-pasted a list of Dutch names you found online
That's weirdly specific, since most of these names, especially the male ones, are hardly used in Flanders, let alone Wallonia
Have you actually ever come across people with these names
The Dutch can have some really weird names sometimes
If I'm not mistaken it's short for Geertrui / Gertrude, but it's still just asking for your kid to get bullied, though
When you find Geertrui a nice name but some asshole called Geert already ruined the name
Randi
Poor guy
Was it short for something else or was it just Sandy
No, I selected names in a much bigger list
These are the names, that from a Romance-speaking perspective, don't sound good or sound funny
Unfortunatly, Dutch and German don't sound nice for most Romance languages speakers
For us, it is impossible not to find these listed names ridiculous, which doesn't mean they objectively are, they are from the Romance languages perspective
I'm quite sure that from the perspective of some languages, French doesn't sound nice either
Not all Dutch names are there you'll notice
Well, you have Bart de Wever, or you have the Gert character from your Samson en Gert
In our past/"current" government, you had/have as well : Koen Geens, Elke Sleurs
But precisely, these are names that in Wallonia will be seen as sounding either not good, or sound funny, regardless of their rarity
Don't forget Brian and Jordan
It's weird how some French speakers like to go out of their way to say they think Dutch is an ugly language
>For us, it is impossible not to find these listed names ridiculous
Wow, and here I thought there were more than 70 million French speakers in Europe
It's good to know they all think exactly the same thing
I fail to see how Flemish people having Flemish/Dutch names would sound bad or funny in Wallonia
I wonder what you would do when you meet a Turk, an Indian or an Indonesian
Just tell them that their name sounds bad in French
Charlie Chaplin be like
Wasn't there a Dutch girl called Bloem Pot
Edit: Nevermind the parents wanted to call her that but the judge didn't allow it and it was in Belgium
"Chantal in Paris" is a title that I would expect on certain websites
We wouldn't tell to someone that we don't like their name
Finding a name funny or not nice doesn't mean we would spit it to the face of the person
I'm just saying that no one in Wallonia would name his/her child like that, because having such a name in school for example would probably result in mocking by other pupils
You know how cruel children can be, mocking names happens everywhere
I had mine mocked sometimes, either first name or family names, despite the fact they are part of French-speaking names since quite likely centuries
When names are unusual, other children will often find play on words or find derogatory associations, that's a problem everywhere
Nevermind the two (yes, two) people called Peter Selie in my little hometown
Oh and Peter Nis, which doesn't sound so bad until you realise everyone abbreviate Peter to Pé. Pé Nis
My ex-gf's name is Andrea
Was always fun when we went on a holiday to southern Europe or to a place with a lot of Italians
Yeah, I already suspected that he’s very anti-Flanders and this just confirmed that hahaha
>insert dutch joke about belgians being dumb here
Sadly, it's not only a Dutch stereotype
I have no idea where it comes from, but the French (and maybe Germans) also have this stereotype
Oh I know
I would love it if Flanders would reunite with the Netherlands tbh (and Wallonia can come too if they want)
Yes please
The saxophone, roller skates, the Body Mass Index, the cassette tape, the Mercator projection, a lot of weapons like the FN SCAR and probably more that I can't think of
I don't know if I would consider any of them 'great' though
Edit: also, bakeliet, the first plastic
So we have the car, the world wide web, the world map, French fries or waffles
Its definitely French fries
[20 Belgian inventions that changed the world]
The internet, the first form of plastic and the CD
But also the saxophone and Asphalt
... And the bikini
Twice in ten years
You forgot bakeliet
The first plastic
Rijndael the advandced encryption standard is Belgian
Yeah we kinda got shared by the whole continent
Oh yeah you're right
The world wide web
Invented in CERN by a Belgian and a British researcher
Toilets
I can’t begin to describe the rage I felt driving 8 times back to the DIY to fix a toilet’s broken flush system
You’re basically condemned to studying for a degree in toilet manufacturing industry standard variations, or buy a completely new toilet set
There are plenty of providers that work on every car charger (e.g. Plugsurfing) . Ok, you get different rates but they work
Belgium doesn't have a state monopoly on alcohol and we also have liquor stores all over the country
it doesnt differ that much, and a lot of taxes and redistribution goes toward making the in-country difference smaller
The term "collaboration" still has a somewhat negative connotation to it, but it's still used, even outside of WWII context
The term Nazi or fascist is used as an insult though
I see, you've been following the Veronica Inside drama
Isnt there a specific term based of Petain's name
Could be mistaking though
Not sure
> Idk about the french-speaking areas in Belgium, but in Flanders there were many collaborators
There certainly also was collaboration in Wallonia, however it was smaller then in Flanders
In Wallonia I think it was primarily Léon Degrelle and followers, he even met Hitler (and Mussolini) and had the "*Légion Wallonie*" in the Waffen SS
They mainly fought on the Eastern front
Of course there was also much more reason to collaborate in Flanders then in Wallonia
I'm Flemish btw
And no I am not defending collaborators in Flanders (they executed my great-grandfather) I'm simply trying to point something out
I've never heard *collaborateur* as a modern day insult
It's used to describe certain members of a certain far-right party who attended parties and funerals of actual ones, though
Nazi/fascist is also almost never used in my experience
Only on reddit do people speak that way
The only thing I can add here is that my friends from the UK are just very grateful that they can communicate with so many different people without having to learn specific languages
They really are grateful to us for that
If you've ever looked into English language teaching jobs in East Asia you'd have known that even having a degree in English still leaves you less wanted than a native speaker without said degree
Divinity: Original Sin 2
Followed by D:OS 1 as well
Mafia 1 always has a special place in my heart
I'm looking forward to the remaster coming out soon
Arma, Factorio, Beat Saber, KC:D, Space Engineers,... such amazing games :)
Yeah i heard it is verry famous in germany ,but why
German city builders have a special place in my heart
Lol I went to Gamescom (Köln) a decade ago and some of the freebies they were giving out was *Lantwirtshaftsimulator*, it was amazing seeing everybody just run over to get a copy lol
Sweet, thanks for the call
My gues was it is one of the few games you doesn't kill nazis
How was it 10 years ago
Summer of 2012 I remember best
It was already very busy
Saw some esports, League of Legends, I want to say semi finals
Right next to some Starcraft esports
Funny when something happened in the LOL game or SC
Half the crowd looked over to the other side to see what was going on
The Borderlands 2 bus was there, it was close to being released and was hyped
People were queuing for hours to test some games like the latest assassins creed (3)
Took a picture of an employee with a sign saying "the queue is 4 hours from this point lmao
Folks had camping chairs and played Yu-Gi-Oh in queue
I think I myself played some Far Cry (3 I believe), near the end of the day when it wasn't as busy
Mostly just hung around with my friend there for the esports, went by the booths, almost caught a freebie Intel processor being tossed in the crowd
Ended up with a baggie full of random codes, posters, stickers and the German localization of farming sim lol
Also went in 2014 but I don't remember that one as vividly
Bigger esports (LoL) crowd I think
Played Guns, Gore & Cannoli (Belgian studio), and Far Cry 4
Now this fall
Kill nazis with your combine harvester for only 5
Nice,if i am wright i think gore&cannoli is from gent
Idk, they seem to be registered in [Kontich]
Dude not fair this is clickbait ,now i must buy it to know what famous things i can explore
Aaaah the anale triangle
Berlin,DORTMUND, hamburg but i could also visit it today or lets say after the covid
Actually pretty cool that you can make yoghurt with bacteria found down there
Didn't know that
Towards the third season, it became too convoluted
It felt like they kept adding layer on layer of complexion just for the sake of being complex
There's a Belgian series called "Cordon".
High production values, very relevant to the days we are going through
I loved it up to the point where I’m currently rewatching it
I think a lot of people like it as well here but I’m not sure that many people think it’s their favourite netflix series
I would like to thank the UK for supporting our independence from the Netherlands
Thanks France for building the Chooz nuclear powerplant in the utter most corner of their territory
I'd like to thank other founding member countries of the EU for creating such a beautiful union
Destroying our country to go to war with France
I'd like to thank the Netherlands for exporting tv personalities to laugh with
Love Luxembourg for your cheap gas <3
And thanks Switzerland for giving me a great place to be during vacations because my country is flat as fuck
Thank you Netherlands for selling us quality weed
Damn how expensive is Norway if you think Swedish alcohol is cheap
Where are you from
I thought France helped us with that
Aren't we doing the same on the dutch border
I know, but the UK and France were the only ones supporting our independence
France and the UK both supported our independence, but I just say thank you to the UK because France invaded us a couple decades before our independence, I don't want to say thank you for that
(And C'mon, no one like the French)
Go to the subreddit and press the 3 dots in right corner above (if you're on mobile)
Then press 'change user flair'
I like the French a lot more than the British, they're more like us and helped us a lot more in the Belgian revolution
Yeah but it was only for their own interest
(Same with the British)
Okay I don't why I got downvoted
This is litterally what I learned in history class
France wanted us to be independent so they would have a French speaking neighbour and the British wanted the Dutch to be weaker because they were their biggest naval concurrent
And maybe thank Belgium as well, cause you fucked us up as well and we forgave
Yea for me it's the opposite, I generally love the French and dislike the English
In my experience as I've been to France countless times, they're the most friendly and open nationality I know and the English came across to me as the opposite of that
Well then our experience is different
I've been a lot to both France and the UK and the British (especially the Scottish) are much friendlier than the French in my experience
Yea that's why I changed it to the English because the Scottish seem more friendly
Wtf bro no
I'm not saying you weren't friendly but in general, and again this is just my experience, people in France were less friendly than people in the UK
Maybe it's because I didn't talk French idk
It's not like  they were rude, but idk how to describe it, cold maybe
I know that we and The Netherlands have carbonated Iced-Tea from f.e. Lipton and you don't find that everywhere
Can't think of any specific Belgian soft drink to be honest
I would think of Nalu here in Belgium, very popular type of lemon energy drink which I personally enjoy a lot
Yeah it[almdudler] is gaining popularity in Belgium too
Never drunk it tho
What about "tafelbier" I don't know if you could really count is as a soft drink, and not 100% sure whether it's all that local
Finley is Belgian i think and Ritchie but not sure if they are actually popular
Gini and schweppes are popular but i think those are French and UK
Aha
Well, it's something for you too then
I still remember the weird looks I got when I walked through London and my bottle of Iced-Tea (which I still had in my backpack) went "psssshhh" when I opened it
I quite hate it yes
That is a dumb decision they made
I watch videos in both German and English, and yes, it's idiotic
Yeah I hate this like "who is this video from
oh Jacksepticeye
why is the titel in dutch
I've never even seen this or heard about it, but I also have everything set to English
I too have selected dutch and english (my two main languages) and i still have this problem so i think something else is going on here
Me neither
not taboo to talk about it at all
i think it's more taboo to talk about the past, in the countries which weren't under dictatorships, because of some aspects in their history that they simply don't own up to
edit: rip my English grammar
yes sorry my flair is not entirely correct
i live in belgium but I'm from a former dictatorship country
i meant that in my country is not taboo to discuss anything from the past (maybe how abortions were done) and in the second part i was indeed referring to the belgian  history
i found everyone in my belgian family and acquaintances /friends very sensitive to the topic especially woth the last discussion over this subject which reached the news and realised that it's never ever brought up  (of course in a discussion where we tall about history /past etc -  i don't expect this to just randomly pop up as a subject over coffee at work or sunday morning at breakfast)
ANYWAY not trying to open a debate, just offering my anecdotal answer
Always Dutch if available
English, because French dubs are bad and French translations aren't really good either
Oftentimes they aren't very faithful to the original text
English
Even changed my PS4 language to English because some games automatically follow consol language without the option to change it
I absolutely hate Dutch dubs, the voice actors often are shitty for the character they're supposed to portrait and the accent
I don't want to hear people choking on a 'G' every other word, no thanks
Definitely in English, Dutch just sounds very lame
Definitely English
99% of the time in english, but back in the day Serious Sam the Second Encounter got the voice actor of Bruce Willis in french, was awesome
The dub of the first Metal Gear Solid is memorable for is very bad but very funny voice acting
English all the way games in Dutch are kinda annoying and if I’m looking for info or tips it sucks to having to translate everything specifically, same reason why I prefer getting Adobe software in English etc
> great French versioning
Once you have tried the games in English, you realise French versions aren't really great
I come from one of the 2 rural area (Luxembourg province, the other being Limbourg) so I wonder what they are going to say
>stuck up, pretentious, rude, and generally not nice people
Depend on which Town/Region it is: Brabant are usually more stuck up than Brussels and the other region
To some extent the same prejudices OP mentioned are also echoed here, but less so I imagine because you're never far from the city and never far from the countryside in glorious ribbon development Belgium
Yes, I have already had situations where speaking some basic German or some basic Spanish would have been very useful
Just deciding which language to learn next can be quite a difficult thing to decide
Honestly, in a European context, you can never know enough languages
I already speak 3 fairly fluent and am looking into picking up at least 2 more
Personally I speak dutch and English
I'm of the opinion that if you live in Western-Europe(Germany for Middle, Russian for far Eastern) just speak the Lingua-Franca
I'm not going to bother learning Spanish while living here
You don't want to learn dutch that's fine
But at least speak English
If you only speak French that's your problem, not mine
I live 5 kilometers from the dutch border
For them, you would need snow and ice to begin with
We don't even get snow anymore, so no
But even abroad I haven't encountered these
Though sticking torches in snow is something I have seen before
Wow that's beautiful
Afaik not a thing here sadly
No because the last few decades we've barely had any snow
Just need to live in the ardenne !
We got some snow recently :)
Yeah this is post is just the Scandinavians flexing on the rest of us commonfolk Europeans on how much snow they get lol
Lucky you, here it was just shitty weather all weeks long, rain rain and some more cold rain
Dear Luxembourg,
We love you guys,  it's like having a cooler little brother
Dear Liechtenstein,
Your country is so beautiful,  your outdoor film festival is really cool
Dear Andorra,
Your people are so nice
I got lost in you once and a compatriot helped me out tremendously
Dear Malta,
Haven't visited yet and i will make sure to do that add soon as this covid thing clears,  I'm very excited ti come over
Dear Monaco,
I loooooooved your oceanographic museum
Dear Vatican city,
Thanks for preserving all that art
Dear San Marino,
You are still on my list to visit,  i want to eat all the foods
And to all of you: thanks for letting us look big
Dear all countries of Europe with the exception of the Netherlands: We forgive you for forgetting us again (well maybe except Germany, please keep forgetting we exist)
As for the Netherlands, we kind of love you, and we hope you don't mind we only ever visit for the weed
You guys are ok,  you make us giggle with the way you talk and you think we have mountains,  which is so cute
Thanks for the kind words, legit had to smile when reading your les bleus comment
We're still kinda salty about that
Aw gosh
This is really sweet
Making me very hopeful
I love milk, drink it every morning at breakfast
It's not that hard, actually
You just kinda don't eat it
You get used to it really quickly
Yeah but my point is you don't have to and it's easy to live without it
In Flanders we say:”In the hole of Pluto
I don’t know if they say the same thing in the Netherlands, can a Dutch person confirm for me
Het holl van pluto
'the hole of pluto'
that's actually kinda weird now that I think of it
But we use it wright
Yeah we do
That was what i was thinking i think i use this  and niemandsland maybe most, but not that i use it so much the most people will use it for my region or limburg maybe
Don't we use  "Jakamaka" to
Or is that more when we mean somewhere we don't know
I think this is more from people from antwerp that use it
I'm a social worker with the mentally disabled in residential care
Most of our residents are risk patients so we're doing our best to keep the virus out
Even though it's mostly a lost battle I think
Flu also tends to spreid like wildfire through our facility
At the moment most of our daily activities are cancelled and nobody can come in or go outside (except personnel)
That's pretty hard for our residents, who tick on routine in their days
Even Luxembourg lasted longer lol
No but seriously, a lot of countries surrendered
Hey we do the same thing, nice
Never heard anyone say the French are polite lol
We cook them better though
Yeah that's what I always heard
At least the great wall bit has some truth to it, the turkic people kinda originated in the central Asian region
No because there's not a direct connection between Rome and Germans, but those same turkic people did migrate west and ended up in Anatolia as the Sultanate of Rûm, which would go on to become modern day turkey
We literally do, the turkic migrations are well documented and studied extensively
Because skyscrapers are very ugly, have no souls and ruin the personality/style of a city
Skyscrapers cities all look the same to me
I watched *The Alienist*, set in 19th century New York, and if it is an accurate reproduction of 19th century's New York, damn, the city was much more beautiful back then than now, without skyscrapers
Take a look at Brussels, back in the day when there was next to no city planning, they would build sky scrapers or rather tall buildings all over the place, replacing the older smaller buildings, which gave a very unorganised and messy look to the city
Nowadays you will find most new high rise buildings in financial districts, away from the historic centre
Back in the fifties and sixties there actually were some crazy plans to pretty much rebuild Brussels in modernist skyscrapers, but before the majority of these plans remained unfinished or were never started in the first place, leaving the city in some unfinished mess of old architecture (which they really should have preserved more of) cut into pieces by the sixties idea of progress
Even countries like China have started to ban tall buildings
They're not ecological or economical
They don't make sense
They're a status symbol, and little more
Europe never went through the phase of building them because when they started to pop up, Europe didn't have to prove its status
Also, the population in most (at least Western European) countries is more equally decided and not all squeezed into big cities with a lot of space between them
[This place totally needs more skyscrapers
I'm not particularly religious but it just feels a bit blasphemous to build higher than the church, no
This
Especially the manageable and cheaper
Even China is banning buildings over 250m these days
Brussels is the reason other countries and cities in Europe started heavily banning new modern developments, not just skyscrapers
Modern developments in Brussels wiped out entire historical neighborhoods
[Yeah, Antwerp definitely needs more too]
Similar things happened to the McDonalds (and other fastfood/restaurant chains and shops) in Bruges
Ah, British people liking to be the US' lackey and selling their soul again
Sorry, but no skycrapers' cities are more beautiful than Bruges, Gent, Tournai, Leuven, Dinant, Namur
Skyscrapers are depressing blocks of glass and steel with no soul
Maybe also say what it means lol "wie niet weg is is gezien" means "who isn't gone, will be seen", it's only used for hide and seek
Wie niet weg is is gezien
Who not road is, is seen
Please, make that they cat wise
I wouldn't know to be honest, because in my experience Dutch people only use Flemish words to take the mick out of us, which we happily reciprocate
I find it very annoying when a person from France doesn't adapt him/herself to Belgian French
It is very disrespectful and arrogant : you are in Belgium, not France, your French isn't superior to ours
Of course, a Frenchperson can't know all of local nuances, but there are some famous differences it's impossible not to know about, notably : the numbers (70 and 90)
We at the very least expect them to swith to *septante* and *nonante* when here
If I go to France, I'll adapt my French the best I can to the way of France, because that's the respectful thing to do and the best way making sure there won't be confusion or misunderstanding
When I'm in the Netherlands, I sometimes start talking with a Dutch accent because Flemish suddenly sounds very weird in an all-Dutch environment
I'm pretty good at pulling it off but am always worried of what people would think if they knew where I was really from
Ja euh, we doen dat in privé sfeer lol
Collega van me vorige week na zijn reiske naar Amsterdam de week ervoor:
Ik: "en oe was 't?"
Collega: "cavakes eh, alé tging goed"
Ik: "niks da u ambeteerde daar
En zo ja wadde dan
Collega: "ja d'ollanders, kmoe ze ni hein"
Heb beetje dialect gebruikt/vlaams om het gesprek beter naatebootsen lol
Nou, jeejtje, wat geinig
Ja iets in die aard
En natuurlijk allemaal voor de grap en dergelijke, niets gemeend, zal zeker meer grapjes uithalen aan de andere kant van de grens wanneer ik de kans nog is krijg ;)
Big love terug, Nederlandssprekende broeders
de "amai" hoor ik zo vaak terugkomen bij Nederlanders die Vlaams nadoen
Zeggen jullie dat nooit
We don’t really use ‘nou’ or ‘jeetje’ tbh
The French are never happy about their president
I'm 38 years old and I've never known a French president that wasn't super unpopular
Not saying they're wrong, but it seems like being the President of France makes you by default, unpopular
Why do French and German people dub everything
Is it that hard to reas subtitles (or learn English lol)
I remember when we watched documentaries in class, we had the option between just the English version with Dutch subtitles or the Dutch dubbed version
Every
Single
Person
Always chose the English version
Maybe because the Dutch one is usually done by someone from the Netherlands with a annoying accent (no offence)
> Why do walloons refuse to speak dutch
A bad education system where they need to chose between Dutch and English
For all the other Belgians shoot me but I think some Walloons also still feel a little superior speaking French
I've never heard of anyone drinking cold coffees
I didn't know it was a thing
In Switzerland there never really was one linguistic community that forced its language on the others, like the British/Anglo-Canadians did in Quebec or the French speaking bourgeoisie in Flanders
The only real division there was religious (catholic vs protestant) and they even had a short civil war in the 1800s. But nowadays religion is a lot less important in general
The Flemish and Quebecois identity were formed in opposition to that other dominant culture, and this is not something that can easily be glossed over
>However, as a Dutchie I love the slight stab we always love to give each other while talking about the other country
Nothing but love from your northern neighbour
Haha I just had to do it
It's almost obligated
Do your ministers own bars
Because that would explain everything
No, sadly I haven't been there
What is weird to me is how long your lunch break is
Instead of it having 2 hours make it one hour and be home one hour earlier, seems the better option to me honestly
Otherwise I kind of follow your reasoning, relative to the sun it is a more standard schedule
I prefer my breakfast at around 8, lunch at 13 and dinner around 19 for a work day
This would be ideal but most of the time not really practical
Just wanted to add a "bic" for a ball-point pen
I don't think normal Dutch does this, but I happen to live close to France, who probably influenced us
Alot of the brands that are already commented: pampers, tippex,
But also bic, it's a brand of pens, lighters, pencils
We call a pen a bic now
There are plenty, but "bic" for a pen is the first one to come to mind
In turkey « fön makinası » means hairdryer (makina= machine)
The blinds reminded me, a (slanted) roof-window is usually called a *Velux* here, I think
I know I do
Are **Bic** for certain pens and **K-Way** for jackets that fit into small bags (different from a poncho
) also as common in the Netherlands as they are in Belgium
I have also often heard (and used to use myself) **Jeep** for all Jeep-like off-roading cars
>7-up for lemon lime softdrink
Is Sprite not popular there
everybody does
Not in Dutch, but apparantly in english dragon and kite can be both used for, well, 'kite'.
In Dutch:
•Dragon = Draak
•Kite = vlieger
Vlieger could be translated literally to 'fly-er' but probably comes from an outdated word for pilot
In Flemish it also means airplane
No, in French dragon is *dragon*, while kite is *cerf-volant* : "flying-deer".
Don't ask why, I don't know
It's not really butchered Dutch but rather that old Dutch evolved into Afrikaans,  Standard Dutch and the variants of the latter
Afrikaans is really funny though
For example 'aftrekplek' is a place where you can get information
It comes from Dutch as
•__'Aftrekken'__ is  'pulling/tearing something of something' (which is how info boards used to work)
•__'Plek/plaats'__ which stands for 'place/spot'.
But in modern Dutch 'aftrekken' has the connotation of 'pulling you off' (masturbation)
Hence for Dutch/Flemish people that would mean that
•Aftrekplek = masturbation spot
German is just overcomplicated Dutch
Chinese tourists standing on the edge of a rock in the Grand Canyon that was hanging over the abyss
They could’ve all died that day
Next to the Windsor Castle, I heard an American tourist ask "why did they build it so close to the airport
". Well well well
Brussels, Belgium a year or two ago
During the month of december there is a large open air christmas market that’s spread out over the city
It brings in lots of tourists and some inconvenience for the locals
Two American couples walk into a café (bar)
It’s pretty crowded, around 20-30 patrons are drinking and talking
‘Hi, are you open
’. The bartender looks around and answers ‘We certainly are’. ‘Great
’ Answers the tourist, ‘Do you also serve Belgian beer
’ A few patrons start laughing, but the bartender answers unphased: ‘We certainly do
And I’ll even pay you a round if you promise not start talking about politics
Walk on the cobblestone roads in Leuven
That's a legit road you doofus
In Etosha National Park, Namibia we spotted a male lion sleeping 5 meters next to the road
We parked and quietly enjoyed the sight
After a few minutes we saw a jeep coming in (way over the speed limit) from the opposite direction
They made a sliding emergency stop right next to us -as they probably saw the lion last minute- and reversed a few meters to get a better view
They were driving an open top Land Cruiser ([example] Leaving the engine on, the tourists took place in the roof hatch while screaming and shouting
The lion -already woken up by the emergency stop- was obviously not amused by this, and started to growl and flex his muscles with a death-stare towards the jeep
Completely oblivious about the fact they were pissing off the king of the jungle, the French (speaking) tourists were loudly laughing and talking while taking selfies
This went on for about 15 minutes, while I was stressfully waiting for the inevitable thing to happen
But it didn't.
[Sleepy kitty]
[Pissed off kitty]
Saw it both in Brussels and Amsterdam (especially in Amstersam though), tourists getting their bikes stuck on the tram lines
Also here in Brussels we have an app called "dott" which is like an electric scooter rental and tourists love it even tho they can't use it properly and mostly drive on the sidewalks despite it writing "Do not use on sidewalks".
A bit less serious but a friend of my sister was in front of the big station in Ghent and he went like,
"Fuck, I lost my bag of weed".
"Stop talking so loudly, there are cops here
"What are they going to do
I lost my weed so I have none on me
A bus drove [here]
You could get a fine for this in Belgium but only if the cop who writes the ticket is having a bad day
r/chinesetourists
It was very spectacular
Atheist, rather anti-religious
You don't start fights in places of worship ffs
How insensitive can one be
Have a modicum of respect for your fellow man
I once witnessed him asking a loud, beligerant drunk to leave the bar
The drunk was a big boy and very threatening at first
It took about two minutes and ten metres from the bar to the door
But when they finally reached the door, the drunk was actually thanking him for being thrown out
Never knew what he said exactly, but it was impressive
España
I live in Belgium, and I have never heard of St
Pauli
Actually, most of Germany is a mystery for most of us
We hear about French news, we know about France, but Germany
Most French-speakers of the country (40% of the pop) don't care about it
That's the reason, also South America
A lot of Spanish and South American immigrants where I live
It's only optional to learn Spanish tho, I did because my uncle is Cuban
This is one of those stereotypes I never understood living in Belgium
If I want to hang up say, a coat hanger, I need to drill into brick and concrete
I always love the "contradiction" between "place with a lot of land but crappy wooden bungalow
No need to tell you that in our countries a lot of land tends to mean a nice looking house because of prices for land
Well, thank you for these informations
Would you recomment visiting Hamburg
For now, I'm only "familiar" with the Rhineland, and have seen Trier, Köln, Düsseldorf and Neuß.
Well it's not because of the immigrants I think but it's partially making the language more popular
All I could think of looking at these homes in Tennessee and such(was there for work) was that it would be useful for my sister to have access to these
She has 2 border collies who need their space and because of wealthy parents she'll have no problem getting the space but it will cost easily over 500k.
Over there she could get a decent home + the land for like 300k I imagine
Thank you
Well, Brussels is our capital, but the inhabitants of Antwerp have a fun way of referring to the rest of the country
There is this common saying amongst the older, proud people of Antwerp which basically translates to ‘there’s Antwerp, and the rest is the parking space
No, that's not a thing here
Brussels region harbor only 1 million people on 11 million, and Brussels City itself is only around 300 000 people
While Brussels is often talked about in our medias, we aren't a centralised country
What we make is a distinction between towns/cities, and countryside/peasant area
It's not just arrogance, it's also partly out of necessity
Because it's near impossible to find a parking space in Antwerp
"#slimnaarantwerpen"
oh but that saying is alive and well under younger people too you know
I, for one, happen to use it sometimes
Also people are not interested in brussel it doesn't feel like belgium
Goes without saying but we usually talk about either Flanders or Wallonia when we're not speaking about Belgium as a whole
We mostly compare Flanders to Wallonia instead of the capital to the rest of the country
It was almost 10 years ago, I was about 20
I was living in London with a Swiss girl and we both spoke French together (I'm from Belgium)
We went to that big park where on Sunday morning people can come and express themselves
Some talk about politics, some about religion
We were really excited by what we saw, we really liked that idea of being able to have these public debates
On our way back home, we sat next to a man who was writing in a little Bible
So I said to my friend, he's probably preparing himself for next Sunday
Which was not meant in a mean way, I meant it like for these debates
But he also spoke French and thought I was making fun of him being religious
I tried to explain myself but it just made him angrier
So I just said sorry and sat there feeling stupid and ashamed haha
I don't think I ever had that problem visiting other countries, notthe Netherlands not France (the others we visited I was a youngling in plastic fairy wings)
I do think keeping up with trends and such is fairly big here
I'm Belgian and lived in Australia
Had some British and American friends who asked me if I was going out
I asked them why they thought so and said because I was dressed so nicely
I said these are my daily clothes
In conclusion:
The Germans are the Americans of Europe when it comes to dressing
The western Mediterranean does it best
I think we do put a good amount of effort into dressing well in general when we go out of our homes
I do think it's quite easy to blend in there, I've never experienced any weird looks or seen any type of clothing we don't wear here
And I don't live near the border either
Clogs aren't what other countries would call 'chic'...
I have a South-Korean colleague who joined us not long ago, after working in Germany for 2 years
She said “the Belgians have a way better taste in clothes than the Germans”. I have never thought that about Germans but apparently others do
well I do think there's some things you just don't do, if you go out in sweatpants they'd have to be within the range of sweatpants that you can leave the house with and should be paired with something good, and mainly stuff like that
I suppose it's something you get or are accustomed to living, what's aloud where
I feel naked if I leave the house in sweatpants
I think dressing to fit is one of the more important parts here
You don't wear certain stuff certain places and if you go overboard (regularly) you'll be gossiped about and generally seen as someone in dire need of attention
Fair enough, carry on
Honestly I did it once and it felt so of I went back to change, but there's people who do it, generally though they are LO en sport, so nine hours of sports a week not counting hobbies and that seems reasonable, even then there's a say in which type
I live only a kilometer away from the French border, so it's definitely at least once a week
For Belgium as a whole it's very common to cross the border for business or pleasure
I live about half an hour away from France
I actually don't go there that often, maybe a few times a year
There's this shopping area I would go to not far over the border, but I'm not that big on shopping
But the company I work in has many French employees, so those people cross the border on a daily basis
(Not counting in Corona-situation of course)
I don't need a passport, my Belgian ID card is good enough, no one's checking (except for in certain situations maybe, but I never had it)
If you missed the [road sign] you wouldn't even realize you crossed the border into a different country
&#x200B;
When I was little, there were less IKEA's in Belgium, the closest one to my home was in France, so that's where we went
When we used to still buy bottled water (now we drink tap), once every month or every few months my dad went to a French supermarkt to get water, it was a little detour on his way home from work, but the water was way cheaper
I heard that in the Netherlands, people who live close to the border with Belgium cross the border to refuel their cars
I've also heard about Belgians going to the Netherlands to buy glasses, apparantly they're cheaper there
As we are a small country, we have easy access to the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Germany, France and in lesser extend the UK
From where I live I can be in all border countries in an hour (by car or train), the UK a bit more by train (~2h)
A passport is not necessary as we have national IDs, a lot of Belgians will not have a passport as they mainly travel within the EU
It is indeed quite common to casually go to the border countries, just for a quick day out or some shopping
Especially so of course if you live or are staying close to the border
People living close to the border will often do their standard shopping/filling up gas if it's cheaper across the border
Also in school day trips to other countries are relatively common
Sometimes in the weekends me and my brother drive somewhere for a daytrip
There are no borders anymore around here
I grew up on the border with Holland and Germany
My mom and sister both live in Holland
My sister studied in Holland while living in Belgium so she actually did the cross border commute for quite a few years
When borders closed between Belgium and Holland during Corona lockdown it was so extremely weird to not be able to move in our own region
I know we're spoiled and a lot of cross border people have that luxury but honestly
If your people like us Limburgers live on both sides of an arbitrary border it really shouldn't be there in the first place
Abolish nationalism
Yes it's very normal
I live in Germany now, but I work in Belgium, so I cross a border every day
The commute is only 30 minutes
The nearest Ikea is in the Netherlands, and is also about 30 minutes away
We often go there on weekends
My parents, who still live in Belgium, do their grocery shopping in Germany every week because it's cheaper
Like other commenters said, you only need your european ID and you're good
The borders are open and nobody's here to check you
If you aren't paying attention, you won't even know you've crossed a border
> Even though im quite definately sure you would need a passport
Schengen zone residents don't need the passport, just the ID card
>  Is it just normal to go from country to country on a practically daily basis
Plenty of people work in another country and they cross the border daily without controls, etc and you can add in the list those that do their shopping in another country because it is cheaper
Also imagine the passport checks and ensuing chaos here
No, when you cross the border the language changes, laws change, cultures and social norms change, ....
It's not because there are open borders that the countries have merged, each country still very much has its own identity
We went to Barcelona and London in 11th grade and Paris in 12th(which was just a language test basically and sucked balls)
Barcelona was us drinking on the beach mainly during the evenings
London we hired a limo in central London past midnight by pooling some money and drove to "the Eye" and all that drinking champagne in the back with 10 students
Good times
Yes, teachers are fine with it
Bit of a pain finding a place to get alcohol sometimes in foreign countries
Age for alcohol is 16 here
Think we also nipped over the border to visit Lille(Northern France) for a day and my father had a season's ticket for their football club for a while back when Hazard played for them
Sometimes joined him
Living close to the border with the Netherlands we often sell some of our stuff to the dutch(we sell swimming pools) and when biking/hiking we often end up there on accident
Keep in mind if a dutch person talks 3 words to me I can tell they're not from Belgium, even if it is the same language
It's impossible to hide basically
edit: Ow, and as I do live close to the dutch border we went to look at the "afsluitdijk". Basically one of the parts when we learned about water in like 5th grade
My sister works there (crosses the border for work, OP)
Her company expanded over the years and has the border running through the building
Ok so only travel-wise yes, it's a bit like travelling within the US
It is very true
How well people can speak neighbouring countries language depends very much on the residents language abilities (and willingness)
Even within Belgium, if I travel southwards 15km and cross the language border everything will be in French
I will have to order at the bakery in French, all signs will be in French, and the information on the train will all of a sudden only appear in French on the digital signs
And 90% (probably more) of the people will not be able to help me out in Dutch, even in the border towns
Even if I travel to the Netherlands, where they still speak my language, the cultural difference is immediately obvious
Not necessarily depending on your mode of transportation and the regulations of the country you are in
But yes, it is always a good idea to carry a passport/ID when you travel
In Belgium we have to carry an ID at all times, so for us it's standard to have these with us even when travelling
I took a plane from Brussels to Barcelona to visit a fair for work and back and wasn't asked for an ID once
Correct on the dialect thing
The dialect of Cologne according to a German:
"Dat konnemi vorstelle datte de verstehst",
Mildly dialect dutch:
""Da kun(ne)ke me nie voorstelle datte/daje da versta(t)"(I mean, multiple options)
In normal dutch:
"Ik kan me niet voorstellen dat je dit verstaat"
And in English
I can't imagine you understand that
(so basically the verb and "that" gets switched in terms of sentence structure)
I went their with my school last year
We didn't realise their was a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights so we just ran on the streets and hoped we didn't get hit by a car
Holy shit Corsica
Went on vacation by car there and they don't give a single fuck
Overtaking you in a blind corner in the mountains while blasting "bella ciau" and using their hand as turn signal
Maybe "bistro". Which I believe comes from russian
Those words or expressions that mix dutch, italian and arabian are interesting
Gabber comes from Yiddish
lmao awesome
Interesting to see that the majority of these words are practically never used in Belgium
The Finnish word, along with those of the Scandinavian languages, is actually derived from the Dutch word 'kalkoen', which is a shortened form of the older Dutch word 'Calcoetsche hoen'. 'Hoen' is an older word for bird and 'Calcoetsch' refers to the Indian city of Calicut
Never heard that phrase
I do like the drink Pisang tho
Mokkel gets used as 'mokke' at least where I live but beside that
yeah pretty much never
Oh yeah now I hear it
Yeah ‘mokke’ seems to be the only one
Though I haven’t heard it in a while
Back in the early 2010’s teenage girls used to comment it on each other’s profile pics all the time
It seems to be trending again very recently
That was popular when I was young and hip in the early 2000's.
In native speakers it's French
Third is Arabic, mostly because of Moroccan immigrants
If we're talking native speakers *and* L2 speakers, than French is the most spoken and Dutch is the second most spoken language
German would be 3rd (4th actually, after English), followed by Spanish
If I remember correctly: Italian or arabic
They are both spoken more than german which is an official language in Belgium
Almost half of our country speaks french so yeah french
Yeah, I believe more than 15% is Kurdish in Turkey
That's a lot
I was surprised to see so many kids have no idea how to use a fucking computer but are really good with their smartphones
I'm shit with smartphones
Not because I'm old or dumb but because for me, a phone must call, text, do basic apps, wake me up and have an agenda tool
I don't really give a shit about all those other apps
I never used it
I guess I was in the wrong (right
) circles
In my experience it's a minority who actually use it
I imagine about 10% in my social circle and throughout uni most phased it out
Its tolerated, we can grow legally, have a small amount with us without getting arrested or permanent repocussions
We cant smoke it publically though
And if you follow the law correctly you cant drive any vehicle 2 days after useage
Criminal procequtions are only reserved if they can prove you have intend to sell or carry a large amount considered too much  for personal use  I believe its maxed at 5grams anything over can follow to proceqution but it rarely happens
Its not too common and less and less youth smokes it
Its main users are between 20 and 40 years old
I'd say less than 10% smokes on a regular basis
I used to believe it was way higher but considering when you smoke you tend to befriend other smokers faster
Ever since I quit I've noticed a lot of people dont smoke it at all
I went to your country in september this year and we were able to buy weed within 5 minutes of starting to search for some
So I would say it is quite common
This was in a touristy place tho (Plovdiv), so maybe thats why
I feel like it does indeed mostly depend on your social circles
Pretty much everyone I know (say 90%) uses it
That doesn't mean they are all heavy users of course
Most of them, like me, just have a little stash they keep hidden away for social opportunities
A bit like having a drink with your friends
It's a nice alternative once in a while and not at all taboo or anything
However, older people and the police tend to treat it like it's the devils drug and a danger to society as we know it, while in reality alcohol or tobacco destroy so much more lives on a yearly basis than I think weed ever will
I have the total opposite experience
In Brussels I get asked if I wanna buy/sell weed all the time
In Ghent there's a large community who smoke fairly often too
Most young people have a neutral/positive view towards it I feel
French : Thibault, Thibaut, Thibauld, Thibaud, Thibaudt, Tibo,... I wouldn't be surprised if there are more versions hahaha
Not that I know of, but we have several names that are written differently depending on which language they speak: French or Dutch
Kristof and Christophe
Karolien and Caroline
Kristiaan and Christian
Stefaan and Stephane
Just a few examples
I have never seen Michael being spelled as Mikel or Maikel lol
I know of a Thibeau
I probably make as many mistakes in my native language as I do in English because I can't be bothered to double check everything and spend a lot of time on proper syntax
I was leading raids in world of warcraft when I was 16 and people thought I was from England after I told them where I was from several weeks later
Was fun
It 's so cool to such variety of Europeans comment
Same in Belgian Dutch, spoorweg
If i read your user name you speak dutch as well
Not that controversial
The most right wing people would see it as a real problem and the rest honestly wouldn't care much
Well since our federal government is quasi-powerless, nobody would give a shit
But if by "in another country", you mean an Middle-eastern/African country, it would be a shitstorm never seen in the history of Belgium
I'm just impressed people know where their Head of State is born
I don't know the name of our current PM
I know it's a woman but I have no idea where she's born
Are people interested in that sort of thing
I'm somebody that's only really interested in what politicians actually do
Well, as we're a monarchy, the chances of our head of state being born in another country are slim, but not impossible
According to article 86 of the Constitution, if there is no apparent heir, the government can appoint an heir who has to be approved by both legislative chambers with a two-thirds majority
As far as the prime minister is concerned, he'd would need to have Belgian nationality to even become (prime) minister (article 97 of the Constitution), but in theory he could be born in another country
Not sure if it would go over well
We have some pretty nationalist parties who would surely attack him/her on it
Not really, it depends on the context
If you mean by head of state: people from the royal family
Well they're the royal family of Belgium so normally they're Belgians and their future successors are too
But let's imagine that for example, Queen Mathilde would have been abroad when she gave birth to Elisabeth (the crown prinsess, so our future queen)
I don't think people would make an issue out of that
She's still going to be brought back to Belgium and grow up here
&#x200B;
If you're talking about the prime minister
I don't think that would have been an issue as long as it is someone that has a Belgian citizenship, grew up for the most part in Belgium and clearly is very well integrated in the Belgian culture
A previous Prime Minister: Elio Di Rupo
He was born in Belgium, as a child from Italian immigrants, apparantly he was the only person in his family born in Belgium
His family moved to Belgium in 1947 and he was born in 1951
Honestly I don't think people would have made a big deal out of it if he was born in Italy in 1951 and in 1952 his family moved to Belgium
I can't imagine that being a problem
Another previous Prime Minister: Jean-Luc Dehaene was born in France
(He also died in France in 2014) But he was son to a Belgian family
His family was fleeing during the second world war, I think they returned to Belgium in the same year he was born
So it's not like he grew up in France
So purely birth place doesn't have much significance
I think it would be different if they grew up in a different country and then came to Belgium at the age of 15 or later
They probably wouldn't have made it to Prime Minister to begin with
And if they did make it that far, then that probably shows how well integrated they are in Belgium that people would vote for them as a leader/representative of the country, and in that case I don't see the problem either
Wasn't his mother an American citizen
So what does it matter where he was born
His mother seems white so he seems half and half
De Tijd for Flanders
De Tijd is the only newspaper that is doing some serious investigative journalism
They were a part of the team that broke the news on the Panama Papers
Also besides them we have this twitter account called ArbiterOfTweets
Nobody exactly knows who he/she is, but it’s know that the person behind the twitter account is a journalist
Whenever we have a story in Belgium he factchecks it, and he is damn good at it
Do they only attack right wing or also left wing
So the ey also attacked hollande
What does they say about macron
England
Flanders has always had a close connection to England (wool trade) plus it helps that we both had the same enemy (France)
Over the years the relation stayed and we considered them as our big brother (World War 1 and World War 2)
But as in every family we sometimes have turbulent times
I think France and the UK because these were the only 2 countries supporting our independence
Luxembourg cause they’re our only neighbor that didn’t try to conquer us
The Turkic Nations, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Kyrgzstan, Uzbekistan and Hungary (Hungary surprised me but it turns out we come from the Huns that fled to Anatolia)
Hence the name HUNgary
They even have a statue of Attila
Well historically you and Scotland were bff's because of England
[This one is my fave
get your boomer ass out of here
Self burns, gag comics and sometimes a bit to the darker side
Self mockery combined with sarcasm and casual racism
And don't forget the joke about the french !
Don't forget it can get very surreal
Like our art or political system
And also about the Dutch
In short, we are the joke
Belgian and French are natural enemies !
Juste like Belgian and  Dutch !
And Belgian and other Belgian !
Those damn Belgian they ruined Belgium !
It's also fun to laugh at Limburg, even more so because their responce time is so slow
And the West-Flemish ofcourse
Which is fun, because you can't understand their comebacks anyway
Our minister of environnement and agriculture got a lot of hate in 2018 for her respons to climate change
Some students got her phone number and loads of people where sending her messages to do more
She went to speak to farmers and claimed the entire movement was a russian hoax and that the secret service had given her proof that the Russians were behind it all
Turned out that was one big lie and she resigned crying pretty heavily:
I'm happy at least one of our absolutely terrible politicians at least got her comeuppance
Too bad she hasn't been completely dumped by her party, and crazily enough people still vote for Schauvliege
Its indeed sad that she still has a political career
I have absolutely no empathy for her whatsoever
The government we don't have
We have too many governments and not enough governments
We have governements
But not a government
Well, yes but actually no
Shit's complicated
I'd say me but I don't run
Our minister of health's message about the corona virus
Someone made a remix of it
One line in particular was taken out of context
"blijf in u kot". It basically means " stay in your cage"
You shouldn't start to worry untill he starts to base decisions on our road polices
At least you have one
That's kind of crazy most of us only remember the counter vs Japan and that it was our best performance at a world cup ever
It's sad but somehow a little impressive how functional this dysfunctional country is
we're so used to that by now that the fun is more or less gone
She is obese but she is a GP so she at least knows what she is talking about
She's facing some heavy critique ATM because of corona and her choice of words however when she told people to stay inside
haha that was a good video
It's functional
Just very inefficient
The thing that surprises me is how many people follow American politics religiously and then import American problems into European countries
It's often really quite surprising as issues in the US are often times non existent or different in Europe
I follow French politics a lot because of cultural influebce and my online friends post lots of memes about it too
I also follow Spanish politics to a certain extent due to part of my family being from there
I don't really follow our own politics all that much apart from the bigger stuff
I do try to at least have a general idea about Dutch politics though
And the news already says enough about US, UK and French politics so I automatically know something about that
Well Belgian politics are already exhausting enough, so other than that I only really follow what's going on in the EU
For the rest I just get my information from whatever breaks through in the news here
f.e. I know the Dutch are going through some shit right now but I don't really know the details of it
Yes, I follow Dutch and British politics, and to a lesser extent French and German as well
I care a lot about Belgian and EU politics,  but not really about the politics of individual foreign countries
I try to stay up to date with important information tho
Oh you're into the weird shit aren't you
Why Bulgaria
Belgium must be the only country that has a viable separatist movement for its majority community
Not exactly
We indeed didn't have a federal government for some time but we had 5 others to keep the country running
Belgium is the only place with no government but too many at the same time
I don't know if scary is the right word but I have to say that the area around Ypres in West Flanders, with the dozens of war cemeteries has a dark vibe I have not come across too often
There are hundreds of thousands of graves of soldiers who died in WWI and death seems to be everywhere
It's absolutely mind boggling to try to even imagine the sheer amount of people who died there during the war
I can highly recommend the Flanders Fields museum in Ypres, it's really good and informative but will also break your heart
In Prague we visited one of the cemeteries, I think it was the Jewish one, olsany ... Part of it was so old that some graves were caved in and you could see bones inside
We visited one of the hottest days of summer and it was actually quite pretty
People usually start around the age of 15, but drinking gets legal at 16 so they don’t so it for too long
Very popular, probably ever preteen is doing it
Belgium here
Most people start drinking when they're around 14-16
15 is the "they buy themselves a beer" age
Simply tasting alcohol tends to be earlier for most I believe
buying alcohol becomes legal at 16, there's no legal age to drinking it
Anyone under say, 14, gets tastes
Not entire glasses
I was given a bit of wine in a restaurant when I was 12 for example
About 2 gulps worth
Really
So when the police sees a 13y old drinking alcohol, they can’t stop him/her
I had no idea
Isn't that how it is in most countries though
I think it's similar here, but it's not illegal for youngsters to acquire it
Only for others to aid them in doing so
Of course, if they are extremely drunk in public, and it becomes a real issue, the child and the parents might have some talks with child protective services
Not really
In French I'd say "c'est une facon de voir la chose" which means "it's a way of looking at it" or you could simply say you disagree but respect his opinion
Same for me, I'm having a hard time thinking about something
The best I could come up with is just "oké dan" or "het zal wel".
Nog nooit gehoord haha
Ik zou 'het zal wel zeker' zeggen
How about "Allez dan"?
When talking I feel you can bring over the sentiment almost with a simple "k".
Oh yeah defenitally
Forgot about that one
A lot of people, mainly younger ones, have 1 first name and 1 last name, usually the last name from the father, although a couple years ago a law was passed that made it possible to use the mother's last name or both last names
Some people have 2 or 3 first names (or however they're called in English)
These are often the first names of their Godmother and Godfather
But this is more rare these days
Middle names are rarely used as far as I know
So most of the time my just first name and family name
I also have three given names
First name + name godfather + name godmother (godmother-godfather if you're a woman) and then last name
It must be a Catholic thing indeed
Although it is quite old-fashioned because not everybody has that
also changing your name has become easier (if you have a good reason)
In Ghent you can even do it for free
In Brugge you can do it too
I there's a fee tho
I guess you can change your name anywhere in Belgium, but they made it free here, I dunno why
I'd say that globally, Germany is the exception rather than the rule
Not so many countries acknowledge the horrors and the wrongdoings of their past
About Belgium though, there are several reasons, I'd say
At the population level, people aren't always very conscious or knowledgeable about what happened
Colonization is often studied in school as a global phenomenon, talking more about Spain, Portugal, France, the UK, etc, than about Belgium
Congo is mentioned, of course, but it doesn't get the spotlight it should
I left school more than 10 years ago so my memory isn't all that fresh, but I really don't remember anything about it in my history classes
I think that it also depends on what teacher you have and where they choose to put the emphasis in the lesson
Next to this problematic lack of knowledge about what happened, there is also the fact that Leopold II was a relatively decent King for Belgium as a country
What he did in Congo was absolutely terrible, but from the Belgian standpoint, he *did* bring back riches and built a lot of grand monuments
He is actually more remembered as the Builder King than as the abhorrent Congo colonizer, although I feel that it's starting to change
Finally, there is also the fact that people don't usually like to acknowledge the horrors of their forefathers, even if they had nothing to do with it
It's just some kind of nationalistic reaction (although Belgian nationalism is very low)
The first reaction to this discussion is automatically "the Congo Free State was a personal colony of Leopold, not of Belgium". It's true and shouldn't be forgotten by putting all the blame on the Belgian government, but in a balanced debate, one should also acknowledge that many Belgians did participate in it as mercenaries, and that Belgium itself benefited from it
On the political side of things, neither the government nor the parliament have ever officially apologized for it, as far a I know
There is some ongoing progress, however, as the government officially apologized this very year to the children and grand children of mixed union (Belgian father with Congolese mother, often mistresses) for the discrimination they've suffered from in the 1940s-50s. Slow progress, but progress nonetheless
About broader apologies for its colonization past, it's not on the table yet
UN experts recommended this spring in a report that Belgium apologizes, but it wasn't followed by the government
From what I remember, the reactions to this report weren't very enthusiast even in the population and in the media
It would take some courage from the government (something that is currently lacking) to apologize because the population doesn't seem to like the idea (for the reasons explained above)
I would like to see a poll about this though
I hope I could answer your question
Bear in mind that I am no expert at all, and it all comes from my personal experience and following the media
Other Belgians might have other things to say, or even refute some of what I wrote
Do we not admit what happened
Because the worst atrocities were committed when Congo was the personal property of Léopold II, not Belgium
And one of the reason the government take control of Congo was to stop said atrocities
Furthermore, while abjects acts were committed, it was not worse than in any other colonial empire
Everyone seems concern with Belgium, but France and the UK were as bad
I think it's fair to mention that Belgium:
Criticised the king when he took control over Congo
Did not enable the king, with one exception in (3)
Gave the king only a loan to build railroads in Congo to "modernise" this
The king actually got rid of governments that didn't want to do this through some clever political manouvering
Plenty of other countries helped out king in his venture
Once it was revealed what the king had been doing, despite having no jurisdiction over the matter, the Belgian state expropriated the colony anyway
The king destroyed all documents, and died immediately after, making a punishment impossible
The current position of the Belgian government is that they'll eventually apologise for colonialism (after all, even after the king died, Belgium still treated it as a colony)
However, the Belgian state doesn't want to apologise now because the current regime isn't democratic either, and it doesn't want to apologise for undemocratic leadership to undemocratic regimes
Belgium pays a lot of foreign aid to Congo, and monitors the situation extremely closely
It is not
What I want to say is that the Belgian government was not involved it the managing of Congo by Léopold II, and therefore should not have to apologize for what he did
But well for what happened after it takes control of Congo from the king
This question is comming from someone who lives (or lived your flair doesn't specify) in the US: a country that conciders accusing US soldiers of war crimes a valid reason to start a war with the Netherlands
> At the population level, people aren't always very conscious or knowledgeable about what happened
That has not been my experience at all
Everyone I know bar elementary school children know about what happened
> From what I remember, the reactions to this report weren't very enthusiast even in the population and in the media
It would take some courage from the government (something that is currently lacking) to apologize because the population doesn't seem to like the idea (for the reasons explained above)
I would like to see a poll about this though
The Belgian government doesn't want to apologise because it doesn't consider the current regime better than the Belgian regime
It's better than the regime under Leopold, but Belgium had no control over that and criticised it from the start, so it would be unfair to push responsibility over
Especially since other countries funded the king's ventures, while Belgium was quite reluctant in doing so
Out if the two loans he received, one wasn't meant for Congo but misused, and one was meant for Congo but he had to essentially kick out a government to get it
The latter was meant to be used exclusively for building railroads
> there is also the fact that Leopold II was a relatively decent King for Belgium as a country
What he did in Congo was absolutely terrible, but from the Belgian standpoint, he did bring back riches and built a lot of grand monuments
He is actually more remembered as the Builder King than as the abhorrent Congo colonizer
Lolwhat
Leopold II is known as the king who sent the cavalry charge with sabers against Belgians who were demonstrating and fighting to have the right to vote
He was a terrible king, both in Congo and in Belgium
Tbh I had to learn about our kings when I was 10
Not the ideal time to talk about his atrocities
There are no legitimate demands for reparations
This isn't 1919 Versailles
Reparations just create more hate
After the Napoleonic wars and after the Franco-Prussian war in 1871 France had to pay reparations
The French carried anger and frustration for more than a century
The reason demands on Germany and Austria were so harsh was because the French didn't want to relent
Do we really want to go back to an era of pointing fingers
History is filled with atrocities
There will be no end to disputes and conflicts when you start going down that road again
No one will vote to remove it, as they think there are more important issues
A very small minority (racists and people blind to bad parts of the royal family) will vote against anyone that removes it
It's electoral idiocy to remove them
And politicians who make dumb electoral moves don't get elected
Officially not, but every one knows it
If you go back to the reality in the late 19th century, for Belgians it was pretty simple
Belgium didn't have control about Congo, Belgium didn't have a colony, the parliament didn't have anything to say about Leopold II, parliament didn't get any information about Congo, Belgian citizens didn't get any news about Congo
It was a place in africa those people maybe heard about because some belgians moved to Congo and mostly never came back
In 1908 it changed a bit, because it became a belgian colony, and people who moved to congo or had to do with it, all (incl
movements) had their own agenda
But almost nobody was involved with congo to let it grow as a state
Belgians moved because they could build a big house, work as a teacher and retire in the sun (far away from belgian problems)
Catholics moved over to preach and spread Catholicism/"civilisation". Some people from our armies because because they saw career opportunities
In Belgium it was still something people didn't hear about
And yes, on reddit you hear a bit more sentiments about it not being a colony in the late 19th century
Mostly as a reaction towards foreigners who know nothing about our colonial history but still point their fingers towards 21th century Belgians
> That has not been my experience at all
Everyone I know bar elementary school children know about what happened
I didn't mean that people wouldn't know anything about it, but I feel that for most people, it's just about regular colonization + chopped hands
The full extent of the Congo Free State atrocities is barely known
Everyone's experience is different, but from mine, younger people are more likely to know about it, through evolving history programs and increased internet access
>  Leopold II is known as the king who sent the cavalry charge with sabers against Belgians who were demonstrating and fighting to have the right to vote
The fact that I don't even know anything about that tends to show that Leopold II isn't really known for that particular event, but I humbly accept that I'm not representative for the whole population
Different people have different upbringings and different topics in history classes I guess
Belgium does admit what happened and it's a required part of the school curriculum
I've left school for quite a while now, and I remember Leopold II's rule being covered extensively
We must've spent months on it
It's not generally something that's brought up in conversation, but when it has it seems like this has been the experience of people in "my bubble" as well
I don't think a lot of people learn about it on the Internet, although maybe younger people do these days as they have Internet access before they get to middle school and are taught about it
Well, I saw a few lessons about him in class last year and the only thing we saw was that he got a private colony, slaughtered millions of people and mutilated many more for some riches, and that he had to give up his colony to the belgian state
We did also see that it didn't go a lot better after that
People were still being mistreated and murdered, but now the state was at least building some infrastructure
So no, he isn't being taught as the Builder King anymore
Most Belgians don't know anything about Leopold II being a 'builder' king either
To most people he's just known for Congo Freestate
That's it
The Belgian state isn't willing to apologise to the Congolese government as long as it's not democratic
It considers the Congolese government to be a "coloniser" as well, and instead pays them a lot of foreign aid tied into democratic reforms
We live in a ceremonial monarchy
They won't make statements about what another monarch did in the 19th century
And in general monarchy and higher class in Belgium doesn't share the view that's mostly carried by foreigners on reddit
Good
I graduated high school in 2011, I'm glad this is how you get it taught now
Because amongst Belgians there are two groups of people:
Belgians who think what the king did was disgusting, but don't really think it's a relevant issue today
No one will vote to get those statues removed
A very small number of Belgians who support the king, either because they're racist, either because they're blind towards the bad parts of the royal family
They _will_ vote against any politician which gets rid of the statues
So politically, it's a stupid move to remove the statues
It can only cost you your job
Politicians which are that principled don't get elected as they don't care about electoral gains
There's a massive one of him here in Brussels and I walked by it the other day and someone dumped a massive bucket of paint on his head
It was beautiful
Well, that's actually a good question, and I can only guess
Some of the statued are vandalised and people are juridically asking to take down others
Most aren't happy about them, but I suppose not a lot of people are really angry about it
We just don't view him as that bad
I think another reason is because it was longer ago, there are still people alive now who remember the regime of Hitler
But if you take into consideration that in the USA, confederalist statues are also taken down, then I don't know what to say
It's as if we don't care, not many people are even aware of congo and nobody cares
If the world started to acknowledge everything they did in the colonies and concentrations camps then it'd be endless, nobody is clean and we shouldn't care for things that were made by people already dead
We shouldn't give importance to things that are awful because that's how u got the neo-nazis and all of the fascination around this "culture".
Ignore it and it's going to fade away eventually
pretty sure it's up to the teacher/school, graduated in 2006 myself and our teacher dedicated almost a full semester on Congo & Leopold II
Yeah ours didn't, it got glossed over almost
The fact he was evil is a mandatory part of the school curriculum
My gay ass would have a problem
I’m a girl so my life probably wouldn’t have been the best
I would've been a dead baby or died not too long after that due to chronic illnesses
Hooray for medical science
Oh god I'd be a guy
considering I would have been born in 1797, probably dead or not even born
Otherwise, hailing our new overlords :(
Santa is not a huge thing here, so allow me to explain where Sinterklaas lives
Sinterklaas is based on the Holy Saint Nicholas, a Saint from Myra in Turkey
His shrine and relics can be found in Bari, Italy
Sinterklaas totally disregards that and lives in a castle in Spain
Each year he comes down to the Netherlands and Belgium to deliver presents to the children who have been good on 5 and 6 december respectively
As a Polish Belgian I grew up with Sinterklaas (6 of December) who’s from Spain, with the „gwiazdka” or Star on Christmas whilst also always hearing about Santa Claus (Kerstman)
All of them gave presents
To this day I’m confused
Edit: Kerstman I always thought came from the North Pole
the north pole ofc, alternatively Saint Nicholas lives in Spain
Wait, wasn't it Turkey
I've always been told the song is wrong on that one
Here Sinterklaas comes from Spain, but santa from the northpole
But now he lives in heaven
You can send him a letter using the address Spain Street 1, 0612 Heaven, and you will get something back from the post
I've always heard santa comes from Lapland
> Here Sinterklaas comes from Spain
In Flanders, in Wallonia, he hasn't any precise origin/place of living
Oh damn, I had no idea
Interesting
You say not precise, is it never mentioned or is there like a whole list of possibilities
Do people actually have a kerstman in the Netherlands
I've never known of a family that does that here in Belgium
People bring gifts to each other, no santa involved
We already have Sinterklaas anyway
> Not all Germans are beer experts
More like, no German is a beer expert
If you want good beer, that's in Belgium you go, German beer is so light and standardised it is more akin to lemonade from grown up, or flavoured water
Honestly, you should always wear it, it is much nicer than modern clothes
But there is a real Mount Olympus in Greece
In fact it's the highest mountain in the country
Honestly I'd have to admit I probably assumed that Turkey had a dessert too
I think as someone from a small country, it's difficult to understand countries with so much landmass, what do you do with it
(I guess you just have more people to fill it with
Eventhough Turkey might not even be in the top 10 biggest countries in the world, it looks pretty big to me on a map and my mind just can't wrap around it
I always assume countries that are huge must have some completely empty barren wasteland
And honestly many huge countries do have deserts: China, Australia, Russia, US, Brazil, Kazakhstan, etc
So yes it's just my tiny country brain that can't handle the idea of big countries without chucking half of it away as unimportant empty space
Same issue over here
Loads of websites offer French and English only, no Dutch/Flemish
Microsoft f.e.
What
Microsoft is in Dutch
I sell swimming pools and have costumers that can't open an attachment
Should've been more specific
Xbox store was a disaster and still is sometimes or the achievements etc
The Lego website is finally available in Flemish/Dutch after years of only French and English
It's gambling basically
Verkleinwoorden for example:
Huis = House
Huisje = Little house
Doofpotoperatie
It's a perfect word but also impossible to translate
Same in Dutch
Everything to put on a sandwich is beleg to me
In english infinitives it's basically "to"
I dont want *to* do it
“Ik heb geen zin het te doen” Sounds off to me
"Mijn lief"? Or doesn't that fit
Or maybe it's a typical Belgian word
Hmm
about [all houses]
Bot European but you should see the tunnel built in Colombia
In Antwerp, near the harbor we had a beautiful building from the Renaissance
Some dickhead architect decided that it was a good idea to build a large mirrored glass boat on top of it
It is hideous
If you are interested google "havenhuis Antwerpen"
[Havenhuis]
They put a glass boat on top of the port authority building
That's how 100% of our coast looks
No, no, they are really nice
You do get some mismatches like here but it's overall really nice
A better pick would be something like the [Imec-Tower] which faced multiple design problems, generally looks ugly and kinda [ruined the view] at the nearby Arenberg Castle
I love this page
Definitely because there's a few houses in the list that I actually like
Like if [this] ([different angle] had a really nice luscious garden around it and some ivy on the building itself, it would look great
I also actually like [this one] it looks so majestic, though some more green in the front garden wouldn't hurt
Except for the roof part on the left and again the lack of a fitting garden, I quite like  [this one] too
[This] looks weird, but I can appreciate it
I  appreciate the slightly weird ones, if you want to feel like you live in the [Efteling] why not
Was gonna say this
it does help navigation though
You go to a different country and ALL HOUSES LOOK THE SAME
Can't say we're not original
Compared to some other things I've seen o  this comment section most of those aren't that bad
Also called "The North Sea Wall"
One or 2 rows of high rises next to the beach, for 60km
But it can become annoying too, when like a quarter of your country consists of residential neighbourhoods with 1001 different architectural styles
All divided by a little garden and a fence, with about 5 meters between each house
Some people like it, some people don't. I think it would be cool on it's on own, not with the building underneath
And i didn't know the date to be honest, it just looked renaissancey to me
>FLNC
What is that
I see nothing wrong with a good castle here and there
I'm going to be a minority I imagine but I got 2 hours of religion every week and I loved it
Not religious, would even consider myself anti-religion
It boggles my mind how thinking adults can believe in that stuff
But
Just like history I find it important to know the basics of the major religions
Especially when discussing this topic with Americans it's incredible how ignorant they are on some of the main aspect of the most popular religions
And no, going to church doesn't solve that
Incredible how little church goers often learn
For us religion also included things like dealing with loss, relationships, environment, moral questions, etc
Of course the topic was RELIGION
Not a particular religion
But religion in general
We have catholic schools and state schools
In the catholic schools, everyone gets 2 hours of religion class every week
In state schools, I'm pretty sure everyone gets some sort of 'ethics' class
I just graduated a couple months ago from a catholic high school and I honestly don't get why so many people are against it
As an atheist, NO ONE forces you to be religious
That may have been the case 30 years ago, but times have changed
We just learned about the differences between religions, their history and some ethic and moral stuff
Also, the catholic schools are simply better
It's the case in my city and I've heard this from people all over the country
In state schools, they often just teach you the bare minimum that's required by law
The catholic school for some reason are just from a higher level
They teach more and it's often harder
I know so many people that had bad grades in a catholic school, so they went to a state school, studied the exact same thing and were easily with the best of the class
It seems like only people who have never been to a catholic school are against it
They used to force you to be religious, but that hasn't been the case for decades
They do
But it's different in state schools and catholic schools
State schools have to provide a religion class for all the in Belgium recognized religions of which they have students (most often this is either Christianity or Islam)
For atheist/agnostic students, there is an ethics class
Catholic schools only have to offer "religion". Contrary to what you might think, this is not religious indoctrination
In secondary school, it's more information about all the religions of the world and the most important tenets of their faith
We also had some moral/ethical stuff on different ways of looking at abortion, the holocaust
Never any indoctrination, just a brief "these are some models you can use to form your opinion on it"
I'm a teacher at an elementary school
Our kids can decide what class to attend: catholic, orthodox, ethics, islam
Our school is in Molenbeek (Brussels)
So 99% follows Islam
This is not the same for every school in our country
We have public schools and catholic schools
Every school has different 'rules' about teaching religion
Wow, it sounds so
fascist-like, or like a Christian version of islamism
Why are Cypriots so fanatic/fundamentalist/integrist
I was in GO (community education) where everything was available, atheism, Christianity , Islam, Judaism, ... . If there was even one student of a certain religion then the school would look for a teacher for that one student
yeah, one of the first thing my religion teacher did was showing the stats on who believed in god vs who claimed to be religious vs who prays vs who attend mass/religious gathering
Just some basic math showed that their had to be quite a lot of christian that were non believer and non practicians
Everything shown to us was always,
Christianity does A.
Islam does B.
Judaism does C.
Hinduism does D.
Buddhism does E.
How to burry, how to marry, the "coming of age" thing
We covered different creation myths and such as well
And a lot of ethics stuff
10 places ahead of the US in high school education in 2020
(16 vs 26)
Mind you, that's not exactly seen as an achievement
The US is ahead of Hungary and behind Slovenia
That was quite heart-breaking
Still heart-breaking though
I'm a bit sensitive for stories about people that have the best intentions and get mowed down by either life or other people
There is no other option, any other city would make the opposite side of the country mad
It would completely destabilize Belgium
Well, if Belgium would split up (i hope not), it would probably be Antwerp and Namur, dont you think
Luxembourg ?
Clermont-Ferrand is cool, it has free wifi
Still not an option
Eupen is still in Wallonia, with (afaik) everyone being bilingual (French/german) there, with not much affection for Flanders
The Flemish (still being the majority of the population) wouldn't accept this
Also Eupen is very far even from Brussels and too small
Anything but Antwerp
It's not a good idea to have the political capital in the same city as the economically most important city
Also, the people living there would explode from perceived self-importance
Eupen maybe
Culture is dynamic, it could handle a bit of French influx
I live in Antwerp, and i'm sad to say people already do that
They would probably choke on their fat necks lol
But we already are just so awesome
Maybe the Netherlands should join Flanders
Oh yeah I forgot
Why isnt it our capital yet
Berlin used to be in the centre though
Like I said
I think having the political and economic capital in the same place is for the worse
There’s a higher risk the capital forgets about the rest of the country
Paris and London are way too dominant in their respective countries, drawing too much investments and resources to the detriment of other regions
Berlin isn’t, but that’s a fluke of history
There’s also an internal reason: Antwerp would become unbearable
They already look down on the rest of Flanders, we’d never hear the end of how important they are for the country
And we make Blankenberge the capital
We have the de facto capital and the second (or third, depending on how you measure it) busiest container port and we're the 8th largest economy in the EU
I think we're pretty important for such a small country
One of the founding members and housing almost all of its institutions
You tell me
Ikr
The Netherlands is far ahead of Poland and Poland is only slightly ahead of Sweden and Belgium
Would you consider Malta an English speaking country
When I went I was surprised to see/hear the native language that much
Yes, there are downsides like people abusing the system or leeching from it
But the downsides are nothing compared to the upsides
Downside would be that more people have access to it so you have to share the material resources with them
It's not free but paid for with taxes or similar contributions
That being said it is cheaper because the prices for medicine are negotiated with manufacturers to a low price
Do you mean apart from the questions from those living in one of these few countries where falling seriously ill means you either die or go bankrupt ?
It still amazes me that some people still think the alternative of a "for-profit" healthcare like in (for example) the US is "free healthcare".
When is Joe Sixpack going to accept that the system in his country is all about "making profit", whereas the system in most other places is about "making people better".
There is no such thing as free healthcare, and there never has been or will be
Doctors, nurses, support staff
get a salary
Most of the nurses (male and female) and support staff work hard for relatively low pay
Most doctors, however
Waiting times for treatment depend on whether there is a need for immediate intervention or not
This has --at least in my situation-- always been the case
No need ? Well
you wait
It has occurred I had to wait three months to see a specialist
But there has been a situation where "You need treatment that better is not postponed
Is right now OK with you ?"
And yes, this healthcare system is partly funded by taxes
And yes, some pay more in taxes than they get out of it in services
No big deal
It's called "solidarity". That is a word you may have to look up in a dictionary
Some get more out in services than they contribute
We don't call these people "leeches". These people are in need, and we all support the system that --hopefully-- can help them get better
I don't need doctors to treat me like I'm buying a car when I'm in the hospital
That would scare me lmao
you do have large areas with no hospitals nearby from what i've heard, the so-called medical deserts
You can get monthly paychecks if you are considered disabled or too sick to work
There are people that aren’t sick or disabled, but somehow get all the right documents signed to receive paychecks
The subject here would be that paying them would change that fact
Let's assume doctors are usually just neutral, they don't have anything to gain by being an asshole, it worsens their reputation
Why would you want to pay them money to be kind to you
Isn't it better if they are kind to you for reasons which aren't connected to monetary gain
Gone bad
In our household eggs never go in the refrigerator
They stay good for days
Don't worry
The French counting system makes sense, it's just French people who messed it up with their weird-ass 70 and 90
70 = septante
90 = nonante
It's that simple
French people are just wrong
BELGICA FOREVER
Also, as someone who's learning Dutch, I have to say Dutch makes no sense
Anything I think I understand is wrong
I think you mean French from France
As a Dutch, you should be familiar with Belgian French, where the only weird number is 80
Greek it is not the hardest language in the world but it sounds odd
Germans, I like you and my online gaming buddy is a German and an awesome dude but whyyyyyyyy all this der die das dem den des business
WHY
Dutch learner here
I still don't understand if the computer is sitting or lying or standing on the table, and why it's any of those things instead of just being on the table
I had classes of Turkish for two years at university
The language in itself is very regular, but its logic is very different
So, wouldn't say it doesn't make sense, just that it makes a different type of sense that takes awhile to be accustomed to
Turkish is a Central Asian/Altaïc language though, most Europeans don't consider it European, since its presence in Europe is the fruit of imperialist/colonialist invasions from the Ottoman empire
> Also they’ll still look down on you because you’re not actually French
Well, then practice French with Belgians or Swiss people, French isn't limited to France
French grammar isn't much different from English grammar, what do you find so complicated about it
But
It makes no sense
But thanks for trying
\^-^
I could held a basic conversation in the past, but I lost nearly everything since I haven't practiced it outside of the classes
And my classes were 5 years ago
Still glad I followed some courses though, it is an interesting and rather nice language
I would disagree with that on one point
Italy has, the most interesting /crazy history in the world
Whether you look at pre-Roman times, Roman times (especially the non-stop civil wars followed by mad emperors), post-Western-Roman invasions, the catholic medieval mess of Italic wars, the renaissance, or anything around the Napoleonic or World wars, Italy has something stupid, weird and or hilarious for any time period you could ask about starting with the Etruscans pretty much
I'm not a historian, but I know of no countries history that's as unstable as Italian history
There's a few good contenders, like China, or the mesopotamian region for example (not sure which country to assign that mess to, first guess would be Iran), but by and large, none are as out there as Italian peninsula's history, far as I can tell
Same for me
I barely even knew it was a thing but purely through references my boyfriend makes I've learned a lot already since I met him
Weirdly enough I learned more about it then about our own Belgian Revolution
Although tbf, there isn't much to talk about with our revolution
Not sure if this is sarcastic or not, but yes, we had one to gain independence from the Dutch
In Belgium, have been to a few:
-	School courses take 50 minutes each, but sometimes can take up two slots for 100 minute total
When that’s the case, there is usually a 5-minute break in the middle
-	There are usually 7 courses in a day on Monday-Tuesday-Thursday-Friday, with sometimes 8 courses in later years
Wednesday always has 4 courses, and so ends at midday
-	Exact times and durations differ from school to school, but in the ballpark:
-	2 hours of courses, then a 10-15 min break outside (same for elementary as for high school), then 2 courses, then 50 minute lunch (25 min eating, 25 min break outside), then 2 courses, then a 10-15 break outside, and then 1 last course
-	School starts around 08:30, and ends around 15:30, give or take 20 minutes depending on when you started and how long your breaks were
On Wednesday, school ends at around 12:00
-	In every school I’ve been to, there were 2 hours of Phys
per week
When the school had their own sports hall, people went to that room
When the school didn’t have their own sports hall, students walked to the nearby public sports hall or were driven there by a rented bus, depending on the distance
-	In elementary school, students stayed in the same classroom while teachers left and returned
You had mostly 1 teacher for most courses (reading, spelling, art, world orientation (a mix between history, geography and biology)), you might still have another teacher for a select few courses (maths, phys
, religion, ...)
-	In high school, same thing
Students didn’t swap rooms except for a select few courses, though there were more courses with specially assigned rooms
You do your chemistry in the chemistry lab, you do your music education in the room with the piano, etc
-	There is no formal equivalent to middle school, though in informal context it refers to the first two years of high school
-	At university, it’s a bit more YOLO and chaotic
You’d get an agenda like [this] Courses take about 60 minutes here, and swapping rooms is very common for students
-	It’s never fun to wait an hour between two courses, so the university tries to match the lesson plans each year so it’s students get the fewest amount of “skip-hours” possible
-	When you fail a course in university, you might want to redo it the next year and take the follow-up courses of the courses you succeeded at
But of course, some courses will overlap and there will be problems
You can discuss those at the student administration
The only way to never have courses overlap is to succeed at each course always
-	Unlike elementary and high, when you fail your exams at university at the end if May or June, you get a “second seat,” you can retake your failed exams at the end of August or the start of September
That gives you plenty of time to study, and no summer holiday
Or combine both and cut in your studying time
Up to you, you’re an adult now
-	Anyone is eligible to enter university, as long as they finished high school
This is in contrast to Germany, where only people from Gymnasium are eligible, afaik
No need to send letters, you just go to the student administration and join at the start of September
Studying costs about 1000 euro per year, not including rent or food; depending on the amount of courses
It can get cheaper if you have a low income
-	Some courses, such as when studying to become a doctor or a lawyer, may have entrance exams
In those, only the best xx students may follow the course
If you’re studying IT or business, no such entrance exams exist
-	Lastly, fun fact
“Blijf in uw kot” is the Flemish slogan for the Coronavirus “Stay at home”. *”Blijf in uw”* means *”Stay at your”* but *kot* is the Flemish informal word for *student housing
* Even so, it’s a fun word to say
*Kot, kot, kot
* and everyone knows what’s meant by this in Covid-19 context
It's different in Flanders and Wallonia (I'm in Flanders) and times can differ from school to school, but for me:
\- School started at 8:25
\- Period 1: 8:25-9:15 (all periods are 50 minutes)
\- Period 2: 9:15-10:05
\- 20 minute break
\- Period 3: 10:25-11:15
\- Period 4: 11:15-12-05
\- Lunch break: 12:05-13:30 (so almost 90 minutes)
\- Period 5: 13:30-14:20
\- Period 6: 14:20-15:10
\- Period 7: 15:10-16:00
Most schools have a shorter lunch break and have a break between the 6th and 7th period, but mine decided to be different
Also: on Wednesdays we only had school until 12:00, so we only had 4 periods then
The break at 10am was also 5 minutes shorter then so we could leave at 12:00 (no idea why they didn't just end it at 12:05)
I wake up around 7:20
My school starts at 8:30
Lessons are 50 minutes each
We have 2 lessons from 8:30-10:10
Then a 15 minute break
Then 2 lessons from 10:25-12:05
Then we had a break to eat and play some games untill 13:05
Then 2 lessons from 13:05-14:45
Then a 10 minute break and then 1 lesson from 14:55-15:45
This is on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday
On Wednesday, we only have 4 lessons
It's basically the same except we only get a 10 minute break instead of a 15 minute one, so school ends at 12:00
For me it's like this
* 6:30: wake up
* 7:15: catch the bus
* 8:05 arrive at school
* 8:30 school starts
* 8:30-11:00 three classes of 50 minutes each
* 11:00-11:15 break to pee (or in my case work in the shop on Monday)
* 11:15-12:55 two more classes of 50 minutes
* 12:55-13:55 one hour break
* 13:55-15:35 two more 50 minute classes
* 15:35 go home
* ??:?? take the bus
* ??+2:?? get home
(alright that last bit is exaggerated but fuck the busses)
But most schools have a structure that's more like
* Two times 50 minutes class
* 15 minute break
* Two times 50 minutes class
* Lunch break
* Three times 50 minutes class (possibly with a break)
I can +1 this, except for the entrance exam to study law
That is not a thing in Flanders
It wasn't when I started law school 4 years ago and it wasn't a thing this year either AFAIK
Your university courses only last 60 minutes each
Mine vary from 3h up to 4,5h each
It truly feels like hell sometimes
>In high school, same thing
Students didn’t swap rooms except for a select few courses, though there were more courses with specially assigned rooms
You do your chemistry in the chemistry lab, you do your music education in the room with the piano, etc
In my school, we switch rooms for every course
A lot of teachers have their own room
>School courses take 50 minutes each, but sometimes can take up two slots for 100 minute total
When that’s the case, there is usually a 5-minute break in the middle
I've never had such breaks
Also, even 4 hours (200 minutes) of a certain course was possible
There was only the normal 10-15 minute break after 2 hours, although teachers sometimes gave us an informal break of 5 minutes (where we weren't allowed to leave the classroom)
Ah, then I was confused
I'm not going to edit my post, otherwise your post wouldn't make sense anymore
Thanks for the correction though
In my reference point: Multiple course slots exists, sure, just like in elementary/high, but even then there would be a 5-10 minute break each hour
You'd usually just stay in class during that time though
Refresh your brain a bit
Huh
Depends on school then I guess
>although teachers sometimes gave us an informal break of 5 minutes (where we weren't allowed to leave the classroom)
That's the kind of break I was talking about
Sorry for making it not clear enough
In my experience, that happens more often than not, and can be discussed in that way when generalizing the Belgian school system for the internet
Only time it didn't happen was when students were behind on the curriculum and every minute of the course mattered
Yeah I didn't people *don't* switch rooms in other schools
Students occupied a castle to insist on lowering beer prices
Did the advisor get away with it ?
Could you explain the second one
First one is
Interesting
I must say I'm unable to give you an answer to that question
Can't find it reported anywhere so far
Also some say it had actually been organised more as an enormous prank out of boredom rather than for some good reasons like the beer price that would be raised from 3 to 4 franks
De oude stede
Yep, in Gent natuurlijk
[Wallon Buiten ?]
Especially for the Flemish part of Belgium, I would say the first Sunday of April
That day the Tour of Flanders is held
Everyone is either watching the race on TV or is somewhere along the parcours
Good answer
I was focussing so hard on the different national holidays, but not one of them would have everyone in the best of moods lol
This is probably closest to that :p
Here in Brussels it's probably Carless Sunday
Cars are banned from the city and everybody comes out to cycle, inline skate or just walk
There are stands all over the city where you eat, party, give your bike a check-up, or just socialize
24th and the 25th of December
In the Netherlands they celebrate the 26th as well
24th evening and 25th day are both celebrated but it depends on the family
Some celebrate the 24th, some the 25th
I don't think Italy has been united on religion since the Roman empire somewhere :p.
We have a lot of diversity here, a lot of Belgians with all different skin tones
They are all Belgian to me, and taking a normal picture of a white Flemming, would be like taking a white person in America and saying this is the average American, u can't just spot people from your country any more, unless ur country has a big lack of diversity, or u can narrow the group down to Flemmings, Walloons, Belgians with half mixed heritage, full mixed heritage, and so on
Then I could probably guess
Dirk Kuijt is the ultimate Hollander for me
Dirk Kuijt is so Dutch looking to me
Belgium and The Netherlands are so similar but you can still tell that this is a dutch person and not Flemish, he is indeed the most Dutch looking man ever
In Belgium, Brussels and Bruges for sure
There's always plenty of tourists in Brussels, but I still feel it's an extremely underrated city (Belgium's an underrated place to visit as whole IMO)
Every year we have hordes of our Spanish brothers and sisters who come to visit Bruges
I always wondered who that city became so popular in Spain
Probably bruges or brussels
Anyway just the big historical cities
The north see coast, especially La Panne since it's so close to France and maby the Ardenne !
Yeah, and Ghent also gets quite some tourists
The historic centers of the three cities are often so crowded
As for Antwerp, I don't know, since I've actually never been there, and I'm not planning on going anytime soon, with Covid raging over there
Also, we get a lot of German and domestic tourists on our coastline
On a nice day the beaches get packed
Antwerp is quite touristy as well, especially the Groenplaats and de Grote Markt
You really should go once things are better
It’s really a beautiful city (well not all of it haha)
You never have been in antwerp, are you from wallonia
Nope
But Antwerp is kinda far for me anyway, being from Southern East-Flanders
Bergen is closer than Antwerpen, to me
I am from south west-flanders and if you want to see a big comedian or music group it is brussel or antwerpen
Saying it like that “it’s a state in the US” sounds very condescending to me tbh
Also I think everyone would know the names of the states just not where they were located exactly
If you are concerned about it, just say “I’m from the US” and if they want to know the state they will ask
To recite them all
If you say the name, will we know it is a state
Probably
How well do we know the state you name
Really depends on how famous the state is
Don't ask us for their capitols though
I cant really speak for other Europeans,  but I can name most of the states
I can only locate like half of them tho
We’ll know the names I think
Apart from that we’ll also know where the big ones are and pretty mich everybody knows where last election’s crucial states are
So putting Minnesota on a map for might be hard for some, but everybody knows where Pennsylvania is
I think I recognize all 50 as a state and with few exceptions I know more or less where they are(not exactly but I know if it's in the North, South, etc
Although minnesota would be one of the lesser known, a lot of people know most of the states (not where they are on a map though)
I also think minnesota would be known because of big time rush (children's program)
Cultural hegemony over European media is mostly why lots of Europeans are familiar with the names of the states, and they even keep up with US current affairs
Well, more like if you say the name they will know it is a state
If you give them a test and ask them to write down all US states, then no
Yo, I am from the région bruxelloise, it's in Belgium
But I'm originally from Vlaams Brabant, it's also in Belgium
Sounds like a funny way to introduce ourselves by province
Good comparison honestly
"Slovenia" or "Bulgaria" you might not know where it is but most will know it's somewhere in Europe
They even took a city name from Belgium (Hoboken) :)
Exactly :) that’s what I meant
Well, there is the difference in language so it's mostly an easy giveaway
Austin is well known from western movies like Jango Unchained, I think
That's why I know it's in Texas at least
In Belgium you can localise someone quite precisely based on his accent
Damn, the State Capital if New York has less inhabitants than Bruges
It's hard to say, the type of difficulties varies
My mother tongue is French
I have learnt, in school or university, these languages : Dutch, English, Spanish, Russian, Latin, Icelandic and Turkish
And by myself, a bit of Swedish and German
But I didn't continue
For me, my top 3 hardest are these, for different reasons :
* ***Russian*** : because of its pronunciation and its rather complex conjugation and verbs
As a whole it is not easy
I could get around the declensions and cases, since I studied Latin for 6 years in secondary school, so, I was accustomed to the logic
* **Turkish** : while Turkish has a very regular grammar, barely no exceptions, and follows a clear logic, it is a very different logic from Indo-European languages
It is agglutinative, meaning it works by adding suffixes to radicals
What would be one sentence in an European language can simply be one long "word" in Turkish
It asks you to think your sentences totally differently from how you think in Indo-European languages, you don't build your ideas the same way with an agglutinative language
That's an harder switch of thoughts than having to use grammar declensions in my opinion
* It will sound surprising, but **Dutch** : here, not because it is objectively hard or not, I suppose, that after having learnt some other languages it should be a rather easy language
But for two reasons : like most French-speakers and Romance-languages-speakers, I find this language to be particularly ugly (Netherlands' Dutch) or ridiculous/funny-sounding (Belgian Dutch)
It really makes it hard to be interested and devoted in/to it, when you don't find a redeeming quality in how the language sounds
I should learn it, I want to learn it, but it is so unattractive from the aesthetical standards of the perspective of Romance/Latin languages/cultures
Even if German is technically harder I would have an easier time learning it, since I find it more attractive and potentiallly nice-sounding
And that's why I don't count Icelandic in the hardest ones as well, despite the fact it is actually hard, because I find it nice aesthtetically
I've been trying to learn Welsh, and I think it's pretty rough
I started learning Italian once, and that was quite easy, but I didn't have time to continue
German is so hard
Danish
Like what the actual fuck did you guys do with your pronunciation
What's up with that
Why does everyone talk like their mouth is on fire and their brain is simultaneously frozen
Why is the same letter a different sound every fucking time
And this comes from a guy who knows way too many languages (thanks Flemish schools, among others)
From those I want to learn, Russian
Spanish, German and English were way easier because they're Romance and Germanic languages and Im familiar with those since my two mother languages are Romance and Germanic
Russian is beautiful, but totally different
Bulgarian is hard af to learn
Hard language and lack of study materials
If you like a lot of grammer rules
You should really try dutch it has a lot of grammer rules and exceptions
In belgium, you're supposed to learn three languages in school (more can be chosen, but I had a maths extra)
I did try to learn korean, and that's a bitch to learn
Japanese is the samen
The hardest ones for me are tonal languages like Chinese Vietnamese and Thai because even trying to remember the difference between basic words is so hard
Languages like Hungarian may have hard grammar rules but at least i can learn enough to understand what they are saying in a relatively short time even if i don't know how the speak correctly
Govoriti li Srbija
[ja ä bök]
Wait you find German nicer sounding than nice old Flemish
You mock your fellow countrymen
I feel so offended
You really are Belgian
Not that you should talk, wtf is up with Walloon French
Oké matjen, here we go
Ge pakt de stam van uw werkwoord, das basically het werkwoord zonder de -en
Dat gebruikt ge achter "ik" en voor "je". Na "je" of u of hij of zij of zo plakt ge der een t aan, tenzij er al een 't staat
There is no desire to offend anyone
I find Belgian Dutch to be better than the Dutch from the Netherlands at least, some accents are nearly nice
The one from the Netherlands though is the ugliest thing I have ever heard
Depending the accent, German can sound nice, while I have never heard nice-sounding Dutch (sounds like the Dutchies are always trying to clear their throat, that's so guttural ; their hard g' and j' are just the sound of hell)
That's just Romance aesthetical standards talking
All these "art", "oert", "oen", "ijn", "ij", "uin", "org", "oet", "ijk", "oeg", "eert" and others sounds I could mention are just funny/ridiculous sounding to us
I mean, look at all these ridiculous names I'll list below, they sound like the names you would give to dwarves, goblins and gnomes in fantasy
I have selected all the ones that sound funny based on beauty/aesthetical standards in Romance languages :
**For males :**
Gert, Bart, Baaf, Bert, Borg, Brett, Crabbe, Daaf, Dok, Druyt, Faas, Fiek, Flupke, Freek, Goos, Haas, Hacke, Hoeke/Hoefke, Huf, Jaap, Jef, Jejoen, Jokke, Jurjen, Kees, Klaas, Koert, Kuppe, Lebbeke, Leek, Lippe, Maas/Maes, Merck, Naard, Nap, Neef, Nolle, Otte, Pien, Pinxt, Pulle, Raafke, Raan, Raf, Roelof, Rubbe, Rutte, Ruud, Scholte, Sepp/e, Sjaak, Sjoerd, Smeek, Soet, Stoffel, Taal, Teun, Thoke, Tis, Tjip, Treun, Tuur, Tuyp, Viel
**For females :**
Aagt, Aaltje, Ant, Barb, Barbel, Berta/Bertha, Bertine, Bertje, Bet, Betje, Bieke, Brechtje, Bregje, Daatje, Doortje, Drika, Eef, Eefje, Elke, Feme, Femke, Floorke, Floortje, Frieke, Geertje, Geertrui, Geike, Gertie, Giene, Gientje, Goele, Gon, Gonde, Greet, Greetje, Greta, Grete, Griet, Grietje, Guus, Guusta, Heike, Henneke, Hildeke, Ingeborg, Jans, Jemke, Jet, Jetje, Jikke, Jomar, Jorunn, Josje, Joske, Kato, Keetje, Koba, Kole, Koos, Kruis, Liek/e, Lorna, Lot, Lotje, Lotte, Lutgarde, Maaike, Machteld, Marke, Miek/e, Mirte, Neeltje, Nelletje, Net, Noortje, Piet, Pieternel, Reeke, Renske, Riet, Saartje, Sosse, Steetje, Thoke, Toreke, Toreken, Trees, Trijntje, Trinette, Trui, Truida, Truide, Uge, Ulrika, Ursula, Veerle, Viefke, Virge, Vroon, Wantje, Wiebke, Wiske
I mean, are they for real
Who would call his/her child Vroon, Trui, Barb, Bertje, Gert, Baaf, Borg, Fiek, Scholte, Sjoerd or Jaap
What were they thinking
I was exaggerating my offence for the joke of the flemish and the Walloon constantly bitching around, not to worry
Those names truly are ridiculous, some of them sound quite normal and are names I've heard a lot, but most are utter garbage
It can also be stunning, jawdropping, exuberant (that might be a bit of a stretch), fantastic, wonderful, splendid,... I will agree that there are less words with subtle nuances of "good" than other languages have
And if there are, few people use them
I got it, but well, I just wanted to share a perspective
I want to precise though that besides my unfortunate "no-liking" of the language, once I'll have an earning and schedule (searching for a job, just finished university), I plan to take lessons of Dutch again, even if I might not need it, because I do think Francophones should learn it
I really think we should see more Flemish movies and TV shows on our TV and in our cinemas (because for now, there is none on french-speaking channels and cinemas
) and hear Flemish songs on our radios
If we were exposed to Dutch/Flemish since very young, if we heard it much more frequently, if it was part of our environment, I'm sure we would be used to it, and not find it ugly anymore
Because despite the fact I genuinely and unfortunatly don't like the sound of the language, I find it sad, and I'm a bit "angry" at our public medias for not promoting things from Flanders
So, while I know your comment was a joke, I just want to precise that I don't feel disdain for your language
I think this is important, because the Francophone elite of the past showed disdain and disrespect for all non-French languages of Belgium (including Walloon, which was nearly and practically eradicated), that Flemish people suffered from it, and that there are still vile remnants of it among some Francophones
I agree, it's important that both sides learn and practice the languages of the "other side". We have a similar problem with French, no French to be heard anywhere, even our politicians are often dubbed
There is also a lot of French-hate and wallonais-hate here, which I absolutely don't get
It's ridiculous
Fuck yeah
I hope it can grow stronger and more united in 2020 ️
Absolutely
Yes life is good here but i'm not sure about the future of the eu
Glad I live in Europe but disgusted that EU is ruining it
Yes
To be honest, I don't know enough about the matter to precisely say why being in the EU is better than out, but generally speaking, I got the feeling there's more pro's than contra's. Not great, not terrible
Just imagine what we could accomplish if the governments of the EU, Russia and Ukraine would all show goodwill, set aside their differences and worked together to tackle the real world problems
Ah one can only wish
Come together, right now, over me
To give a bit of perspective on that
30 minutes South-West for me is Ghent
30 minutes West is the city of Brugge
1 hour South-West is Brussels
3 hours South is Paris
3 hours North is Amsterdam
etc
etc
If you don’t vote you can get a fine (starting from €30 up to €1000 if I’m not wrong, it depends on which election it is too) in theory, but they rarely actually fine people as far as I know
You don't have to vote, but you have to register at the voting station
They have a list of the people who are domiciled in the voting district and basically just cross out your name when you show up
Very easy to just see who wasn't there this way
In my experience, not showing up to vote barely ever gets fined
However failing to show up when called upon for supervision gets fined pretty much all the time
Yes
It's actually often related to your profession
Government employees, people in law professions or education are more likely to be called as the supervisors of the voting and counting bureaus
If you have been called up once, chance as great you get called up again in later elections because the pool is smaller
Then you have the general population who may be called up as "bijzitter", basically people who get a specific single task on election day (helping out voters with questions, taking names, counting votes)
It's rarer to get called more than once this way, but in smaller voting districts it's definitely possible
You can get a laughable compensation varying between €20-€40
Yeah
People go to great lengths to get out of bijzit duty
We have the pink ballet (roze balletten) which is a conspiracy from the Dutroux age where people believe(d) that there was a network of pédophiles infiltrated in the highest Powers of the nation, organizing outragious sex parties
Another one is the gang of Brabant (Bende van Nijvel) which was a group of gangsters that committed some horrendous robberies on supermarkets with lot's of deadly victims
The conspiracy is that it was a politically motivated attack orchestrated by the national police and right wing parties
The strange thing here is that during the years it became more and more clear that this might actually be true
Our King Albert I didn't die due to a climbing accident, but was shot by a jealous husband of his maîtresse
This has got to be taxes in Belgium
People believe that taxes are payed so the goverment can usenit for building and maintaining a modern transport infrastructure, public services and all
The reality is that all our roads are full with potholes, our trains and busses are always overcrowded and late, our police, firefighters, teachers, doctors are greatly understaffed
Yet we pay the highest taxes in europe ...
And for some reason we all just keep on paying taxes
Apparently Belgium doesn't exist, i don't know anyone who believes that but if you google belgium doesn't exist the first site you come across  is blocked by the belgian ministery of truth
Didn't even know that existed lol
It depends on what you're looking for
Sometimes the Dutch one is more extensive, sometimes the English one is and sometimes the French one is
I just kind of use whichever one is the longest if I want to find something specific
The dutch language wikipedia is quite good actually
It is nice to be able to read other languages (English, French, German, Spanish) so I do sometimes check what wikis in another language have to say on a certain subject
The English version typically has the most information, but other language versions sometimes are more detailed
I usually use English unless it is something that is more local
for some technical stuff (engineering/physics) the explanations can be a lot clearer/more to-the-point in dutch
Not often bit it happens
Also local history is something I always check in both English and dutch
I use them both
Especially for anything related to Belgium or the Netherlands, the Dutch Wikipedia can be a lot more extensive than the English one
Often there'll be information mentioned in the English one, and not in Dutch one but also vice versa
The Dutch one often is severely lacking in content about Belgium though
Often the pages exclusively talk about the material from a Dutch perspective, not including Belgium at all, or only as a small and often incredibly incomplete and outdated paragraph
I find it convenient to have both
Sometimes the English article is just too detailed and the Dutch one is short and to the point
I've seen many articles about very specific stuff (even about Belgium) that doesn't have an English or Spanish article, but that does have a Catalan article
Unless you are 14 or something, I am impressed by your ignorance
I've had Germans ask about the Belgian language, so it could be worse, I guess
Very common, most people drink tap water, it's good quality
Uncommon, even though our tap water is really good
Yes
Why
Because it's drinkable
That's honestly the only reason I can think of
Where I live (around Ghent) almost everybody I know buys bottles
Everyone in my family and a most people I know drink tap water
Funny, where I live, (around Gent too), almost everybody I know drinks tap water
I don't know anyone who doesn't drink it tbh
Some people see it as something more for "poor" people maybe, but that's kinda elitist bs
Taste is fine for me, but can't really argue but tastes
I'm kind of weary of foreign tap water because I know water quality in Belgium is really good, so when abroad I would drink bottled water to be sure
You drink a lot of blood then
For me it's the opposite
Maybe it's more a local thing
No it is common he tripping
Finding a job in Brussels is almost impossible
I thought my difficulties were due to not speaking French/Dutch at a high enough rate but after consulting multiple natives/expats it seems that it's just a Brussels problem and even trilingual natives also can't find work
There will be no new plots of land after 2050 and in 2030 they will severely cut back on the amount of new plots available
Brussels is very stagnant and undynamic
The entire city feels like one big government quarter, almost entirely dominated by civil servants and Eurocrats
My city is economically stricken, nothing has changed much, a lot of unemployment here
There was to be a shopping center but there is an insoluble conflict between the city and the developer
The site is now a big urban wasteland
Socialists have always been powerful in power for a century due to a mining and steel history but also because they rely on a network of clientelism and on nostalgia for struggles for social gains
I understand a bit the Flemish desires for autonomy for this reason
My country is heavily indebted and spend badly
No one wants to make the necessary reforms due to a very complex state structure and community issues
Politicians have the mentality of being responsible for nothing and always accuse the other
Same in my hometown (Leuven - Belgium)
I met an Irish guy in Brussels who said that it's cheaper to live in Brussels than in Dublin, I really did not expect that
Brussels is not so prosperous economically, a lot of unemployment especially among young people and immigrants
Many HR are Flemish and favor their own communities and those who speak their language perfectly
In addition, the job market in Belgium is very rigid and there is too much socialism there
British people go to Jamaica and also make a fool out of themselves it's so embarrassing to see, I'm so glad I'm not from the touristy areas of the country so I don't have to witness it
similar to here where the gov sold a huge building (might be classified as skyscraper) to only rent it for decades
The longer I live in Brussels the more the nepotism heavy culture is apparent here especially in the EU institutions
I'm moving to Berlin after, if I can't find work it will be surrounded by depravity not the EU
I think Belgium is one of the only countries in the world with the right amout of socialism
I find it really sad so many Flemish people became so selfish and stopped caring about each other
This through our social provisions
Same in Belgium
Even my local supermarket doesn't take visa
Tf, isn't Vancouver like insanely expensive in comparison to other Canadian cities
Honestly wouldn't think Dublin would be worse than Vancouver B.C. (Narduwar voice)
My friends apartment is dead in the city center at 800 for two bedrooms
My one bedroom apartment is Art Deco style not too far from
The Center by public transport and is 740+75 in charges so 815 a month
My apartment is more expensive than average though because I personally wanted an apartment in this style but you can easily find a one bedroom in Brussels for less than that
The apartments here are also of a very high and good quality, I’ve yet to see one really bad one
Yis
Where in the Caribbbean
It's a big place and every country has something different to offer
I can definitely provide some advice about Jamaica though
Jamaica is a great place to live if you:
are not gay
American evangelicals had their way with us as they did many poor and black countries and it has been the worst stain on our culture in my opinion
Avoiding clichés of course, the culture is very laid back and chill
Other than that, if you intend to live (or visit) there and you avoid Kingston you will be fine
Kingston being the capital the violence is largely concentrated there and it's definitely not a place that you would want to expatriate to and I've personally never spent a very substantial amount of time there even
Personally I'm from a very rural area in "Maggoty
" Other areas of the country that are cool are: Mandeville, Clarendon, Hanover, Saint Elizabeth, Trelawny, Westmoreland
In my opinion the Western part of the country is definitely the most beautiful in landscape and also happens to be the safest, it is here where most people live off of the land and mind their business
You can rent a house very cheaply there and live in the mountains lol
I plan to do the same thing at some point even if it's just for a brief amount of time
The food is absolutely amazing and it's what I miss the most living in Europe, the landscapes are beautiful, the people are funny and endearing, and it's a really amazing culture to experience in its entirety
I get annoyed with tourists who visit there because they essentially never experience Jamaican culture in its authenticity because they often spend their entire time in resorts
There's a youtube series that I'm aware of (that I don't necessarily endorse either lol) called Ras' Kitchen that documents the life of a Jamaican rasta and a few episodes features some British/Scottish/European dudes who have moved to Jamaica
They live "in Bush" though lmao which basically means they live a very simple and straight forward life living off the land, but it's not indicative of a life that every Jamaican lives
Since I'm from the country I couldn't give you any indication of what city life in Jamaica is like but I don't think I'd like it anyway
Edit: [This] video gives you a really good idea about what the Jamaican countryside is like and the rasta in it is really funny and is a good representation about how most country rastas are like
Yes, Jamaican landscape is overall largely natural and unexploited
It's a pain in the ass sometimes if you go hiking or fruit picking which is usually why you will see people travel with machete in hand, to hack away the bush
> Is this in an area of the country considered mountainous
The W. part of Jamaica is definitely amongst the most mountainous and has the most naturally beautiful and untouched "nature
" However, it is an Island and there is beauty throughout the country
The Blue Mountains for example can be seen throughout the Northeast/South of the country
Very BEAUTIFUL views and amazing natural scenery as well
> You just introduced me to the concept of "country rastas"
Rastas are a very visual part of the culture
They are stereotyped far too often in the West and a lot of people just know the parts of rastafarianism that are the most shallow (smoking weed, locs, etc)
They are very serious about how they live and most are very spiritual people who live very simple lives and live off the land
Many are vegans and commit to living their lives very naturally
>  From the video I also assume that Jamaicans have no issues understanding other English accents and dialects
Not a problem
Our mother tongue is English but we speak in a dialect called patois
If you don't understand it (which you probably won't lol) every Jamaican can speak without the dialect to just standard English so that you can understand what they say
We won our independence from the British so we also sometimes speak using British colloquialisms as well
> Also, I have absolutely zero points of references for Jamaican food
It's AMAZING
Especially the breadth of the fruit in a tropical country is nothing compared to what is imported to Europe
I read being crazy old, and I had no clue why you were talking about the warmest january
From my experience (french speaker) Paris only has incredibly wonderful people or incredibly rude ones, nothing in between
Yeah the plastic isn't staying in europe, i've learned that we export it mostly to asia and it isn't pretty
It's also January 17th in Belgium
What a coincidence
Yep, the ski resorts have to work a lot to keep the pistes in good health
For those wondering why Brussels isn't even on the list: it's because the city is divided in a dozen different administrative entities
And for those wondering whether that's a good idea: no it's not, it's an absolute mess
Szczecin soudns familiar but I'm not 100% sure, otherwise Brno
For me it was Szczecin in Poland, with 400,990 inhabitants
After that it starts getting fairly common for cities that I've never heard of to appear
Iași, Romania; Bydgoszcz, Poland; Plovdiv, Bulgaria and Constanța, Craiova and Galați in Romania
All the way down
But I'm a geography student, so that might account for something
That list doesn't even have the European capital, Brussels .
Poznan, which incidentally only has a slightly higher population than my city (Antwerp)
Good to know
Brussels only needs to get counted the right way to be top 5 or something, they only count 1/19th of the city for
reasons
To be fair, it's not the German name for the city
It is called Köln
In Dutch we call it 'Keulen' which I think is closer to the German spund than "Cologne".
Yeah but it's only a small part, the other parts aren't suburbs or something, it's just more city
Strange list
Just try to speak it (Dutch here)
You will make mistakes but we will most of the time understand it and will be glad to help you
I find the best way to learn language is to hang out with people who are native speakers
Since I was 10 years old I always had to study French
For 8 years I studied it and I was horrible at it
I spent 6 months in the US on a semester abroad and met some French friends
They taught me more French in that 6 months than my 8 years in school
Some tips when you learn a language in general:
- listen to music in that language and look up the translations in english
- If you have a basic knowledge of the language, read a quality newspaper (for Dutch that would be De Morgen/De Standaard/De Tijd in Belgium)
- listen to the national radio station
There you will hear politicians and famous people talk (Dutch would be radio 1 in Belgium)
Well, step one would definitely be picking one language
How much I loathe them, but a good way to get a grasp of our language is by watching our soaps (Thuis, Familie),  because they use very clear, understandeable Flemish
Other tv shows can be tricky
One the one hand you have shows where the Flemish is very basic (like FC De Kampioenen), but a lot of shows embrace our dialect diversity, which can make it hard or a learner to follow (I'm thinking shows like Van Vlees en Bloed; Eigen Kweek; Matroesjka's to name a few older ones)
Tu spreek keine Belgica
Written press is mostly the same I figure
The moment we all open our mouths tho, that's a different story
As you said: native speakers
But you're right
yeaa for sure, i do feel like a bit of a european, going to france or germany on an easy vacation, netherlands for shopping etc, no border annoyances (usually), no need for money exchange etc
its pretty nice
Belgium:
When you forget to close the door: This isn't a church
In Wallonia it's ''We're not in a church here''
When the food isn't ready, I'd get "shit with beans" as an answer
That would be "do you live in a church" here
Dutch royals are forbidden from having any position of power or public authority in Belgium
So they can't be on the throne, they can't get access to the public sector and they can't participate in elections
**That's in our constitution
Another one: In Leuven, street musicians can be fined for playing off-key
In Hasselt, you can get fined for using a sports field for any other sport than the one it was intended for
You were also not allowed to wear a mask that covers your face (before Covid-19), but exceptions are made for Sinterklaas, Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny
On to national laws: if you get declared bankrupt, the curator cannot take away your last cow, 12 goats or sheep, one pig and 24 chickens, along with the food they require
I love my country
Uhum: WIJ WILLEN WILLEM WEG, WIL WILLEM WIJZER WORDEN, WIJ WILLEN WILLEM WEER
(We want willem(the king of the netherlands) gone, would willem become more wise, we want willem back)
I can't find it either lol
I looked it up and it is said that  it's considered a decree with constitutional status
I can confirm this is true
Oh yeah I forgot about that one
Best revolution ever, way better then ghe french one
No, you can't in Dutch
To give you a few examples: au and ou sound the same, you need to know which it is
So do ei and ij
Most of the time, yes
There are some spelling rules that you need to remember
Loan words are completely a seperate category as they still can have their original spelling
And of course, we have exceptions that you just have to know
"Wraak", "wrat", "erwt",... these are for children some difficult ones to spell
No, not at all (Dutch)
C can be pronounced as K or S, depending on the word
The J in the common name Jef is pronounced as ZJ
Words ending in -tie are pronounced as -tsie
There's also a large amount of loanwords from English and French, with similar problems
We had a russian student in our school, she would open the russian version of google maps and would be able to pronounce every village exactly as we would in dutch
Pretty cool
French consistent with rules
There's not a single rule they don't have exceptions for
Or do you mean pronounciation rules
it was surprising to me that the russian text she read sounded exactly the same as what we would call the village
This is not always the case
Whereas an english speaker would have difficulties pronouncing brugge like brugge and not like Bruges, she would just read the text and it would sound exactly the same as I would say it
When I was a student I had a summer job at a butcher shop
When you had ‘to go’ the code was ‘I have to go see Albert’ or when someone was called for ‘He’s helping out Albert’. So customers wouldn’t get offended
The boss was a staunch republican (not in the US sense) and Albert was the name of the King of Belgium at the time
The smallest room (het kleinste kamertje) in Dutch
My dad always said pissodrôme
He was always the classiest person in a room
I don't think I've ever seen him without a suit
I personally like to go for tongue-twisters:
Hottentottententententoonstelling
De kat krabt de krollen van de trap
Als een potvis in een pispot pist zit de pispot vol met potvispis
De koetsier poetst de postkoets met postkoetspoets
Als kakkerlakken in kattebakken kakken, heb je een kattebak vol met kakkerlakkak
Reminds me of the song:
>Door de kamer vloog een vlieg
>Vliegensvlug vloog daar die vlieg
>’t vliegen van de vlieg was vlug gedaan
,want ze vloog tegen de vliegenvanger aan
>O o o,...
>’t Vliegen van de vlieg was vlug gedaan
want ze vloog tegen de vliegenvanger aan
>Flanders they make it so soft that it's almost a 'h' sound
That's west flemish
The rest of Flanders uses a regular soft g.
Gemakkelijk by a west-fleming sounds like 'hemakkelijk'.
We also say 'dikken' where I'm from but when people from somewhere else hear that, they are confused or insulted lol
I'd like to add "pieke" but AFAIK that's only used in the region around Sint-Truiden
We need Krampus
The only solution
We needed a king and just got a royal from somewhere else
'Never be king in your country
Come to Belgium, we have the opportunity for you
All you have to do is send us your credit card information
In 1989 a soviet mig pilot ejected from his plane in Poland due to an issue with the afterburner
The plane kept on flying on autopilot until it finally crashed on a solitary house in the rural kooigem in Belgium
Killing an 18 year old boy who just finished his final exams and who wanted to sleep in while his brother and parents went shopping
The diplomatic consequences where minimal because it became clear the cold war was running on it's end
To commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle at Waterloo, Belgium wanted to mint a special 2 euro coin
Because the battle at Waterloo is a sensitive subject for a lot of French, they vetoed it in the Council of the European Union
Instead, Belgium decided to mint a 2,5 euro coin to commemorate it, because that doesn't require approval by the Council
Jeez, good thing royals these days aren't being married to each other anymore as a rule, what a bunch of unoriginal people we were
I went on an Erasmus exchange last year and lived abroad for about 4 months, so I feel like I can answer this question
So I applied for Erasmus with my home university, I was accepted and they sent a message to the receiving university (in Bordeaux) that I was coming over, so to please let me attend classes
Other than that, I was on my own to get enrolled there and find accomodation
So I went through the motions of applying for student housing (Bordeaux actually has a bit of a problem with that but I was able to get it through the university)
They were being a bit bitchy about the required documents because I needed some documents that were specific to French citizens and they didn't accept the Belgian equivalent ones I sent over (despite being in French as well), but I was able to get it after jumping through some hoops
As soon as I get everything sorted, I hopped in my car, loaded up with a bunch of stuff and made the drive to Bordeaux
Roughly 900km from home, but I had some friends with me who were going to go surfing nearby, so we could switch drivers a few times
While I did bring my passport along, my identity card would have sufficed
Once I went through some administrative stuff to get properly enrolled at the University in Bordeaux, I lived my normal student life as I would have in Belgium
I went out to bars, went grocery shopping, cooked my dinner
Just everything I did was in French
The language was really everything that was different, as I just paid for everything with my Belgian debit card and everything
The most major "limitation" I had while there was that I had to spell out my name letter by letter every time someone needed it, as it was distinctively not French at all
EDIT: I'm not sure about the civil engineering market in the Netherlands but if you're not hellbent on living in the Netherlands, you can move one country over to Belgium (thanks to the free movement ;) ) and get a job here, as we're in dire need of civil engineers
Almost every civil engineering student out here has a job lined up for them months before they graduate
We have the highest density of castles per square kilometer
Untill the end of the Middle Ages (and even after that), 'Belgium' (or actually 'Belgica') and 'the Netherlands' used to mean the same thing
It meant all of the Low Countries
Belgica was just the Latin translation
Edit: when the Dutch gained independence Belgica was also used to refer to them
Now I know where I'm from
>Rovaniemi
O is in "open mouth in amazement"
What happened to Inari, Sodankylä, Kittilä and Enontekiö. Did these cities stop to exist ?
Many also don’t know that the English sent a counter-Armada as a response/retaliation, but which was equally unsuccessful and quite a disaster
Many also don’t know that the English sent a counter-Armada as a response/retaliation, but which was equally unsuccessful and quite a disaster
> The self-label Deutschland comes from the Latin [Theodiscus]
It's actually the other way around: 'theodiscus' is a latinisation of the West Germanic word \**þiudisk
Belgium has the most, because a mile is a larger unit then a kilometer so the same applies for them squared
And about wales they say it has the most per square mile while about Belgium they say it has the most per square kilometer
So according to mathematics and logic Belgium has the most
My nickname actually is Thomas The Dank Engine in both my friend groups who don't know each other lol
It is amazingly large for one administrative entity
I wonder how (for example) police officers do their work
I mean, the distances these people need to cover
Here, a postman fills my letterbox three times per week
how does this work over there ?
I also wonder if there is some sense of "community". Do people come together regularly in social events, or church or something ?
Most amazing
Very hard to grasp the concept, living in a place with neighbours one brick away (and currently engaged in an argument making a lot of noise)
> Other countries such as Germany favoured retaining the coins due to retailers' desire for €1

That's right it's 1

I only joined the Scouts for a short period of time, but it was exactly the same as the Swiss Scouts when I read your description of it
It was also just ment to be fun, we'd walk to some random place in our neighborhood and play games over there
The leaders where young adults (18-25 like you said) and also over here they all had their own personality and humor
We'd always do stuff outside, except if the weather was exceptionally bad
I didn't had the nickname thing, but maybe that was because I haven't been part of the Scouts for long enough
First off, there is no "boy" Scouts
Chapters are all mixed gender
It's mostly as you described in the Swiss model
In Belgium you have regular Scouts, which are but you also have other compeeding variants, like Chiro and KSA
There's some good rivalry between the variants, but it's all basically all similar to what your Swiss experience is like
Basically it's mostly social hangout activities for kids
There is certain aspect of real "scouting" (as in making camps from logs of wood in the forest, making fires etc) but these are mostly done in the summer camps
Throughout the year it's mostly fun games, and organising events to raise funds for the chapter
It's the same with special names (totems) and their are some advancement ceremonies accompanied with larger activities, but the focus is mostly on fun, especially among younger members
The "leaders" are the "older" members usually in their late teens/early 20's. It's expected to learn to work independantly in the chapter without further adult supervision and it's rare to have older supervisors or leaders, and usually these are people for whom scouting is a second life
So apart from fun, it's also a way to teach organisation, leadership, and cooperation skills to young adults
Something you didn't touch on
I've heard alcohol is a big no-no in the US scouts
Is it the same for Swiss chapters
The use is not prohibited, and I have a hard time imagining the Belgian scouting scene without beer
Many kids in scouting have their first drinks on scouting events, and among the older members
It's expected that the older members inspect the ones pre-drinking age, but it's not uncommon for them to turn a blind eye to minor infarctions
It's pretty much the same in Belgium as it is in Switzerland, but it's still separated between boys and girls
And we have the special names too
We call them totem names and mine was cheetah
Something you are told you'd carry your entire life
All I know about Belgian scouts is from my brother's experience
He became a scout at 16yo and based on everything he told me I'll say : drunk
Well not everyone ofc
I'll add that all the scouts from my city were rich bitches who bullied me for years  you can imagine I don't like scouts very much hahaha
How your scouts experience will be depends on the group and you yourself
Mine went overal well, great people, loved the leaders and the activities, but I personally didn't feel great in the group
The group did nothing wrong, everyone was realy friendly and all
I just felt uncomfortable so I left at age of 12
No regrets for having joined the scouts, no regrets for leaving
I would definitely encourage my hypothetical children to give it at least a try
The memories are good
Wow seems like you went to a very wrong group
Those ruin it for everyone
Because in general Scouts & Gidsen Vlaanderen is an extremely well organised and responsible organisation, but of course the different groups choose how much they want to follow their rules and guidelines themselves
I remember when we went camping, we once found a member of another group on his own in pitchblack woods
We called the leaders and apparently it was a 'punishment' and they were going to pick him up again a few hours later
The kid was on crutches for christs sake
I can't imagine how you can be that irresponsible
What if he wandered away
How in the hell were they planning on finding him
You literally couldn't see your own hand if you stretched it out, that's how dark those woods were
It always makes me so furious when I hear stories like that because normally the scouts are an amazing place to send your kids
I've learned all kinds of valuable skills and responsibilities
The survival things you were talking about are done and practised by every group I know
Setting up tents, shelters, HUDO, cooking (although not all the time), firemaking, navigating etc
It saddens me that there are some groups who are mainly in it just to get drunk with their mates
Haha children should be able to be dorks sometimes
We do
One of the oldest towns of Belgium, Tongeren, started out as the Roman settlement Atuatuca Tongrorum
Large portions of its Roman wall are preserved and it further honors that heritage by also housing the Gallo-roman museum
None are well´preserved, there is the gallo-roman museum
in tongeren
But they only have outlined where the original walls were build
In the museum they´mostly have artifacts
I happen to live in a town that was created by the romans
It started as a trading post and evolved i  a small town
If you dig deep enough you can find coins or shreds of roman roof
Neveneffecten - wildlife
The beat doesn't sound very interesting, but the lyrics are fabulous
Ain't really a guilty pleasure if it's one of the most universally liked songs (in my experience)
ja jongens we hebben de gabber gevonden
I am Belgian but I feel like “ Het is een nacht” is our guilty pleasure as well (and all Marco Borsato’s hits)
If you're going for any song by the Gebroeders Ko, it has to be "Ik heb een boot"
You should drink the right beer out of the right glass
You should double fry your fries and eat them with salt and a sauce (30+ different ones) of your choice
Couldn't agree more
Also they're Belgian fries, not French
Anytime that gets brought up anywhere, every Belgian agrees
Bless you
Please sir, we are a neutral country
I once went to Sziget and Stromae was performing
He went on this entire rant because someone had translated fries in his song to French Fries and every Belgian in the tent was screaming so loud in agreement
It was great
Good action, keep educating your felllow countrymen about the correct usage of glasses
Actually yes, when going to the frituur/fritery/fry place to take a pack of fries with a type of meat you need to have some kind of sauce to make the meal complete
When eaten in a restaurant with beef and a salad for example it is not necessary, or maybe a little bit of mayonnaise
There are a couple theories
One is that American soldiers called it French, because in WW1, while they where in Belgium, the official language of the belgian army was French
So they just called them French fries
Another one is that it's based on the verb 'to french'.
Don't forget a snack like frikandellen of bitterballen, always eat fries with a snack made out of mechanically separated meat
I loooooove Derry Girls
So sad the upcoming season was postphoned
You uhhhm, you think you guys can give us some money to improve the roads first
Get your Lays out of here
You name your snacks after zombies now
Once I played Halo with a guy for like an hour before checking his profile and seeing he was from the Netherlands
We were speaking English to each other the entire time
It happens all the time in Amsterdam (not with Belgians, but with Dutch speaking people)
A lot of people who work there actually don't speak Dutch, so usually I just address them in English
It often happens that, after a while, I find out that they actually speak Dutch
Then I switch to Dutch, they keep talking in English, I'm confused and return to English, then they answer in Dutch, we're both confused and just continue in English
Yup have it sometimes on festivals here
But their accent mostly gives it away
It happened to my father who was speaking with a Dutch person, he heard my father speaking French so he began to speak in French with my father and my father heard to his accent that he was Dutch so after a few minutes my father asked in Dutch (because he is bilingual) if he was Dutch because it would be easier for him to speak Dutch than a Dutch person trying to speak French and the Dutch person was completely bummed and said "so all the time I was making an effort trying to speak French with you, you could speak Dutch"
It's not English but it is similar
He couldn't tell you're Spanish from your Spanish ID card, but could from your last name
Did the same, thought a Swedish girl was from the UK - her English accent was so perfect I asked which part of the UK she was from
Edit: I am from the UK but live in Belgium
Wait, is it common for people to mistake Swedes for Canadians
Same especially in southern France
Oh wow I didn't know that
That's interesting, thanks
No, becasue they are not allowed to leave a package without a signature
They go to a package shop, if they fail to deliver it after a few attempts
You can pick it up there
I once saw a parcel at my neighbours front door and took it home, only to deliver it to them when they got home
I told them about the incident and advised them to make a complaint
It never happened again after that
It was in the summer of 2019
Delivery services don't leave packages unless you specifically ask them to
And most of the time you need to sign off on it
The only time I've known them leave it at the door is when they can see we're home, and they ring the bell without waiting for us to come out
only bpost does this
postnl dhl ups dpd all live it at our door but it probably depends on your region i live in a friendly street in pajotteland  but i imagine that in cities this wouldn't work
How did you recieve the packages then
I get mailbox delivery packages aswell but never that way
Post
nl has one of the best delivery guys of the region
He's a self employed driver so you can even  expect him to deliver on a saturday or sunday
Very friendly and overall nice guy
Couldn't agree more about this one
> Unfortunately, that character is of drunken Brits fighting and pissing in the streets
It's an acquired taste :p

(Dutch "as" means ash)
This is the only Dutch word with a phonemic glotal stop
I love how the verb vögeln also exists in German
It is also a popular Flemish slang for sex
In Dutch, treffen only means to hit
We do have the expression: "Ah, dat treft
" (Ah, what a coincidence seeing you here
I believe it's about €900 a year, but it depends a bit from university to university
Textbooks not included, which can be quite expensive for some courses, especially during the early years
So overall, not as good as it can be in Europe, but definitely affordable to put your kids through college without going into debt, which is pretty awesome
Here in Belgium every citizen gets "points" for studying
We call them study points
When you first start out, I believe you start with 60 points
You can spend those on courses: 5 points for English, 15 for medical, ... (I'm making these up, I don't know the exact quantities)
If you succeed in a course, the first year you get double your points back
If you spend all your 60 points, and you don't fail any courses, you get 120 points back
After that every year, you get back what you spend on the course
Spend 10 points, and if you succeed, you get 10 back
Of course you still have to pay for housing, but you can also apply for grants and stuff like that
I don't really know what the situation is for foreign students, maybe they also get points, I don't know
If you don't have any points, you can also just pay for courses
I don't think they're exactly cheap, but they're not American-like expensive
Belgian beers and chocolates
Everything is expensive af in Belgium
We honestly can't complain
Our taxes though
That's a different story
In Belgium it is very expensive I have 1gb for 10€ and this is even the cheapest you can find in Belgium, before I had 250mb for the same price and even wifi and TV is super expensive around 30-50€
It's years ago that I had a decent thunderstorm in my region
We only know 3 weather's. Clear sky, cloudy or rain ... . This year we even didn't got a lick of snow
No, the thunder is okay and in itself it could be pleasant but thunder generally means lightning and I'm really scared of lightning
When I'm inside a closed off house or car I'm generally okay
But I wouldn't open a window, which has resulted several times into me overheating and sweating myself to death (not literally of course) in my room because I refused to open a window
During periods where lightning is more common I worry a lot about leaving the house
I'm terrified of being stuck outside while there's a thunderstorm
I don't have a car or a driver's license, so if I go somewhere it's always by bike
It really worries me a lot, I don't want to end up outside during a thunderstorm (definitely not among open fields) but I also don't want to end up in a situation where I have to let something important go for my fear of lightning like going to work or meeting up with friends
&#x200B;
I was once caught outside running in Florida when a thunderstorm came, luckily I made it to the house before it got really bad
But still it really really worried me
I was really tired and started to speedwalk (instead of run) but everytime I heard thunder I got so panicky that I started to run again
I also knew that Florida was the lightning capital of the US where yearly more people die of lightning strikes than in any other state
Yeah that didn't help ease my mind at all
Yeah but only when I'm cozy inside
Actually I feel very happy during any kind of storm when I'm cozy inside
Thunder is soothing
I love it
"Boterham", it means "slice of bread" but literally translated it means "butter ham"
Stokstaartje (meerkat) -> stick tail
Ovaries = eggsticks in Dutch
Random others:
- Snelweg = Fast road (highroad)
- Vrachtwagen = cargo car (truck)
- Drilboor = drill drill (drill)
- Baksteen = bakestone (brick)
- Verrekijker = far looker (binocular)
- Stoelgang = chair hallway (stool)
Mierenneuker = ant fucker (nitpicker)
muggenzifter = mosquito sifter (also nitpicker)
bleekscheet = pale fart (very pale person)
klokhuis = clock house (the core of an apple)
boterham = butter ham (sandwich)
gelukzak = happiness bag (lucky person)
And the second one
Klootviool
Lol I've never heard of that but it sounds really funny
I think those are mainly used in Flanders
I use them instead of wentelteefje
I've only heard of wentelteefje
Hallo
Mijn naam is Seppe, het is een genoegen jouw te ontmoeten
Van waar ben je
Hello
My name is Seppe, it is a pleasure you to meet
From where are you
Dutch/Flemish from Belgium
Yeah we have the same in Dutch
The obvious answer would be wolves but I like to be contrarian and actually believe boars are more deadly
Depends
Ticks, wasps and bees would cause the most damage due to allergies or lime desease (in case of the ticks) and their cheer numbers
The common adder is really rare to encounter and get attacked by, but they are our only venomous snake
Its venom also isn't *that* strong
We have gotten handful of wolves reïntroduced, they so far avoid humans but can attack sheep and have done so
The wild boar is probably the most dangerous to encounter in the wild
They are pretry common is certain regions and can lead to fatal accidents on the road, you also don't want to be charged by them
Cows, mainly the Belgian Blue can be dangerous aswell
To take a dark turn: Humans would still be the animal that cause the most fatalities to other humans
Tl;dr: So either we include humans, in which case we win
Otherwise it depends on the parameters
Likeliness of an encounter/attack
Likeliness of severe wounds/death in case of an attack
The wild boar would probably be second place with the first parameter, behind the creepy crawlers, and first with the second parameter
Boars
They don't seem that bad, but they can be terrifying and damn fast
Glad somebody spotted it
If a Belgian answers "wolf" here I want to strangle them
Fuckers are cowards
Much rather find them in the woods than boars or lynx
(although the change is high all 3 of them run)
The European viper is definitely not as dangerous as those other two
They tend to avoid human contact and theire bite is more than half the time not severe
(Confirmed in the wikipedia link you posted)
If you are attacked by a Brown Bear or Siberian Tiger you are more likely to die than if the common adder does attack you
To be fair, we meet far more often boars than wolves
Big spiders are usually not the one you need to be afraid of
Especially in Europe
Yeah wolves have actually returned to Belgium in the last couple of years
While it's a contributor, wolves simply don't kill many people, full stop
Predators tend to avoid unnecessary conflict
You don't see a lioness attacking a giraffe for example
Can't talk for the other guy but the problem is that in some languages there isn't really a distinction(same for things like "lend" and "loan")
Same word in dutch
A snake and toad can be "giftig".
> In a simulated battle our platoon of 3 tanks distroyed over 120 Leopard2 tanks in multiple waves without a single loss on our side
How the hell do you even pull that off
lmao
Frightening German efficiency
For Belgium:
The King is the head of state but has no political power
He is not even allowed to have any political opinion, unless backed up by a federal minister
He often does represent Belgium abroad in diplomatical missions
Technically he's also the commander-in-chief of our armed forces
Since he's a trained fighter pilot, I don't think people really mind that he is
The prime minister is the head of the executive branch of government
Usually, a couple of political parties who together have over 50% of seats in parliament will join in a coalition together and pick ministers and the prime minister among their ranks
The positive aspect of this is that the government can rule pretty efficiently, as the majority of parliament is of the same political color as the government
Side note: Belgium has a bit of a problem with forming coalitions every now and then
Back in 2011 it took us 541 days to form a government
It looked like we were going to break that record since there was barely any progress in forming one since the elections in May 2019, but the still acting government in "running affairs" as they are called was granted special powers to handle the current crisis
A monarch and president are pretty much the same position which is head of state and a prime minister is the head of a government
Chancellor like in Germany is pretty much a different name for prime minister
There are often some small differences in balance of power between those roles though
Oh man Belgium has a king, prime minister and 3 regional governments
It all works somehow (arguably, we haven’t completely descended into chaos as of yet)
We don't even fly our own flag (barring during the world cup)
They pay
Have free movement(of goods, services, people and capital)
Have no say in EU law
Have to abide by many laws with some exceptions(fishing and such)
-C’est arrivé près de chez vous, if you can talk french, it’s probably one of the best author movie that tou can find
Belgium - C'est arrivé près de chez vous
"c'est arrivé près de chez vous" known as "Man bites dog" in English (1992) from Belgium
It's a great dark comedy presented as a fake documentary following a serial killer
'The Broken Circle Breakdown' is absolutely great
Especially if you don't know what it's really about, it's effect is just amazing
The movie I enjoyed the most by far from Sweden is 'Let the right one in' - never found another move with an atmosphere quite like it
Gomorrah
It's still a mystery how that managed to lose the academy award to Shakespeare in Love
Sounds spooky
You know of New Kids Turbo
It's not a movie I'd expect to go international (except to my own dutch speaking Belgium of course)
It's not necessary but reading the Wikipedia page of the Easter rising helps a bit
You get the slightly more subtle references
Well it means fear so you're not wrong
I came upon it by checking imdb top lists IIRC - it was very well acclaimed, and rightfully so
And is it still as hilarious
Because here it makes fun of a certain stereotype, with certain hairdressing, clothing, language and cars
Well, I would say that the movie cures depression, so maybe watch it again, it could be the path to the enlightement we had around 2012
CERN
They had touchscreens waaaay before the rest of the world, who knows what kind of crazy technology they might have right now
The colonies
The Belgian equivalent is Kleine Brogel
It's common knowledge that it is an army base where US nuclear weapons are stored
But the Belgian government keeps denying it
Because it's quite a nice piece of stand-up comedy: this is Scheire's complete routine (in English) about CERN
It really is
Seg ge moet die hun idee ni zo afkappen
It’s basically « you are in hell, which one of the demons would you like to torture you
Not from Europe, but I'd definitely choose Jacinda Ardern
At least she has common sense
If not her, just anyone with common sense
Nicole Minetti
no man, that's a hydra
Yeah and our King is too
I love how different Flemish is to your guys' dutch
Nothing wrong with your dutch ofcourse but it's crazy to me how much they differ, for example, Flemish is a lot more formal even in informal situations
You guys say "jou" or "jouw" while we say "u" or "uw". The differences are in the small things and I love it
Dutch (flemish): I love our diminutives
We can make everything small, cute or a nickname by adding -tje, -ke, -je
Like they do it in Spanish: Bruno becomes Brunito
I lived in Australia and what I love about the Australian english is how they shorten everything
Arvo = afternoon
Brekkie = breakfast
Avo = avocado
Barbie = barbeque
Maccas = MacDonalds
And so on
I like how similar Dutch and German are
You can quite easily understand eachother without really having to adapt too much
Lekker lekker lekker lekker
For the rest i personally think dutch sounds kinda dumb, prefer it over french tho
>Re: the Dutch word "lekker", in German we have a similar word (lecker), but it is only used in terms of food being tasty (or maybe in like a sexual context I guess, though probably not often)
When I first moved to NL and heard people call other people lekker casually I was like excuse me what
Just so everyone knows, this is very much a Dutch thing
In Belgium 'lekker' wil only be used with food and in a sexual context like in German
Yeah I like how different the languages are in some aspect without really losing any connection
Same for Flanders
The town down the road has a wildly different accent/dialect than me (because of history, see below)
Move to a different province (which is maximum 50 km away) and you get a completely new way of pronouncing vowels and different vocabulary
And still we all (usually) understand each other
[Except for West-Vlaams] (sketch, dude is "mad" his dialect is being subtitled)
Check sidebar videos for more standard Flemish to compare
History: my city used has a [medieval hunting lodge/castle (built in 12C)] and the [next town over] were expert falconeers
They developed their own lingo to keep the rifraf from other villages from learning their secrets to falconing
And it just developed from there
So now I say "Ààrendoenk" and they say "Jèrendunk".
Dat is bij mijn weten nu ook geen waar, zeker in het noorden en westen van ons landje niet
I'm guessing he's talking about Dutch not Spanish
And I have to agree, gezellig is a really nice word
Nope
We say 'goe weer'
Het woord 'lekker' is pas naar hier gekomen wanneer de standaardtaal is ingevoerd in de jaren '60
Daarvoor was het gewoon geen onderdeel van de taal
Well in Belgium we eat our fries with mayonnaise, and that disgusts too much people
Américain préparé, it’s basically raw meat with seasoning and we spread it on our bread
Raw minced meat mixed with a raw egg, pickles,onions and tabasco
I heard several americans say they will not even try fries with mayonaise ( the only correct way btw) and that it disgusts them ???
Belgium
Ours are pretty tame compared to some others I bet
- kop ("leftover meat" in gelatin)
- ox tongue (usually in "Madeira sauce")
- ox tail soup (is that even weird
- some people like calve brains
- escargots
- blood sausage (though commonly found pretty much everywhere in Europe)
- people outside of our continent sometimes consider horsemeat weird, but other than riders, nobody would really bat an eye about it
Blood sausage is one of the best thing to eat in winter !
I studied in the States and when people saw me eating fries with mayo they were freaking out
Thank god for like minded people like you in the States
Why not, probably more from alles correct
As you know New York was first New Amsterdam, if you have a mix of English and Dutch alles correct becomes quickly oll correct
And Boston is close to NY
You never know, and we probably never wil certain
So, we have 6 governments now
1 federal one
3 regional ones: one for Flanders, one for Wallonia and one for Brussels; 2 for communities: one for the French speaking community and one for the German speaking community (yeah, we took some land from Germany as war reparations for the War)
What about the Dutch speaking community
Ah no, that one is combined with the regional one for Flanders
I know, confusing right
You know how the Germans just occupied us for 4 years and destroyed our country
About that
"yes, we're still a country
And no, French isn't the superior language"
You think that's snow falling out of the sky in Russia
Yes, a great modern nation that loves ~~PiS~~ peace
Thx for clearing that up
My intent wasn't really political, as I was just trying to make a (bad) pun
Financial district in Brussels maybe
Antwerp central station has nice modern elements inside too
I went to visit and it seemed very dead and empty tbh
Liege Guillemins station
Het Eilandje and Nieuw Zuid in antwerp are pretty modern too
Financial district
Antwerp is integrating more and more modern elements into the city
Nieuw-Zuid, Justitiepaleis, Havenhuis, MAS,  the currents works on both the leien and kaaien
I mean, google it
[Here's a decent pic]
Knowing both French and Latin, I understood a surprising amount of the Italian page about some boxer
Native French-speaker here :
* Gallician, Catalan, Portuguese : could understand most of them, they are rather close to French
* Spanish : same, but since I had Spanish classes in secondary school and university, hard to say what is the result of closeness to French or what I have learnt
* Romanian and Italian: could understand some of it, but clearly less, they are more difficult to understand from my native French-speaking perspective
Understood Spanish without too much trouble
Italian was hard
I understood a word here and there
Portuguese was easier to understand as I thought, but harder than Spanish even though they're very alike
Romanian, I understood a few words here and there but was even more unclear than Italian
Catalan was okay-ish
Kinda like Portuguese: similar to actual Spanish but didn't read as fluently as the latter
Galician was harder than Spanish too
Understood in great lines, but Spanish was definitely the easiest to get
French is my mother language
Baggins was translated as Balings
It absolutely means nothing and is not related to our word for bag at all
Then again, Thorin Oakenshield was translated very literally as Thorin Eikenschild, which just doesn't sound as cool
Then when we jump to the Witcher, I in general believe most names were kept the same, but some things got
weird
Dandelion got translated as Ranonkel
To start of, Ranonkel is such an obscure word that I literally did not know that it was a word until I looked it up
Secondly, it's not an archaic name for dandelion, but for buttercup
And for some reason the name of Geralt's horse, Roach in English or Plotka in Polish, was never translated and just stayed as Plotka in the Dutch translation
But once we get to ASOIAF, shit gets real arbitrary
The names of most keeps are translated, which I don't mind as most of them stay true to the original and don't look too out of place
But some first and last names are changed completely without rhyme or reason
Jeyne Poole's first name gets changed to Jaene, which is still a very weird name
Any name ending in -y gets changed to -ing, so Renly becomes Renling, Manderly becomes Manderling
Once again, I've no idea why, as the changed name is just as weird as the original one
Yes, absolutely
I'm so grateful to have had to opportunity to visit in seven years ago
I'm saddened at gut level, I'm from Belgium
In my city there was kind of an "architectural tragedy" of a similar kind during the Revolution when the [Cathedral of St-Lambert] was destroyed by the revolutionaries
It was a masterpiece of gothic architecture, one of the biggest in Europe, even Napoleon of all people thought that its destruction sucked
Of course, this is much worse because it's a Paris landmark, it's like the nose in the middle of the face of the city (even though the Sacre Coeur or the Eiffel Tower could hold that title, but if the Eiffel Tower collapsed, it would be much less of a tragedy IMO)
I don't understand people that honk at learning drivers
In my country there is a big blue L in your rear window, so anyone waiting behind you KNOWS that you're just starting to learn
It boggles me how they think that making the stressed young driver EVEN MORE stressed by honking at them will somehow make them go faster
Flemish and Dutch are the same language, written you wouldn’t know the difference (like British and American) and i never had any trouble understanding a Dutchman
I haven’t heard a lot of Frysian in my life but it’s pretty hard to understand for me, although it sounds familiar
Reading is difficult but understandable
Afrikaans is kind of the same, altough i would say that it might be easier to read and harder to understand than Frysian
Luxembourgish sounds like German to me, so i can make out some words but i can’t really understand it when spoken or written
I don’t know what Low German sounds like but i can’t understand it (idem to Luxembourgish)
Flemish is basically the same as Dutch
Dutch people should have no trouble understanding Flemish apart from some dialects like West Flemish
I have never had trouble understand a Dutchman
Spoken Afrikaans is hard to understand but I'll sometumes have a general idea what they're talking about
Written Afrikaans is a lot easier to understand though
Edit: after this conversation I realize it's actually super easy to understand
With Frisian it's kind of the same story as with Afrikaans, although it's slightly harder (both spoken and written) to understand what's going on
Never heard Low German/Low Saxon
I looked a bit at the Wikipedia from both Dutch Low Saxon (Low German spoken in the Netherlands) and the German Low German version and I could understand almost everything from Dutch Low Saxon, but Low German was a lot harder and I probably couldn't understand half of it
I wonder what dialect the Low German Wikipedia is based on
When I was in Luxembourg I heard some people speak Luxembourgish and I couldn't understand anything
It almost sounded like German but it clearly wasn't quite German
I can barely understand it written
I'll sometimes get a general idea what they're talking about but that's it
Low german and luxembourgish isnt really mutually intelligible with my language (Flemish)
I dont know much about Fisian,  but I think it's more mutually intelligible than Low German and Luxembourgish
Afrikaans is pretty mutually intelligible
Dutch is perfectly intelligible since it's thesame language
From my point of view (Belgo Luxembourgian) who used to speak Lux at school a long time ago
Lux-German/Low German: Still understandable
Lux-Flemish/Dutch: I understand a few words but I can't understand the more complicated word (there are still some word we have different Morgen/Moien but I understood them due to having learned German in Primary school)
Lux-[Frisian] Not at all, rarely a word sound familiar but without looking at the caption/traduction I can't really be sure what it say
Lux-Limbourg: More than regular Dutch
Dutch and flemish are mostly the same but there are many dialects of flemish so some are not the same and very different but standard Flemish is the practically the same as dutch
Afrikaans is understandable to someone who speaks dutch if they don't talk fast but it grammar is different and some words can be completely different so a dutch speaker will need to study afrikaans if they want to talk with a Afrikaner
luxembourgish is very different from dutch not intelligible Frisian is also very different from dutch it is hard to understand
Low German has more in common with dutch than German but it can still be very hard to understand if you also know some German the language becomes very simple but if you only speak standard dutch it is a lot harder
>  i never had any trouble understanding a Dutchman
That's interesting, because as a learner of Dutch and native French-speaker, Belgian Dutch and Dutch Dutch sound like different languages, it's hard to believe it's the same
The many hard g's and other random guttural sounds, the flatter melody, the words sometimes pronounced with an "English" accent makes Dutch Dutch so aesthetically different from the softer, more melodic, never English-sounding Belgian Dutch
What I notice when on holiday for example, many Dutch people do not recognise Flemish when they hear it, which I think is strange
It's not that they don't understand it once they realise it, but that initial "ah you're also speaking Dutch" trigger takes a good while longer
I always find that strange/funny :)
> Dutch - Local Flemish dialects: varies from difficult but doable to understand to totally incomprehensible, almost always subtitled in the Netherlands
Don't feel bad about that, most of the time it's subtitled here too :P
I feel you need to know that my mind read this with a Limburgs accent for absolutely no reason that I know of
All correct but I'd like to note that both West-Flemish and Limburgish, are seperate languages, while what we call Flemish is just Belgian Standard Dutch
Which is, like you said, just standard Dutch with a different accent, some words used differently and some words that the other doesn't use and vice versa
Flemish isn't a dialect of Dutch
It refers to the dialects spoken in Flanders
The official language is just Dutch
Wa bedoelde ge daar nu weer mee >:(
As a Flemish speaker I'm flattered
heavy West-Flemish dialect is completely unintelligible to ~~me~~ everyone
Brabants(region of Brussels) and general dialect mostly
Bit dumb to use it so much imo
Like, every Flemish person can probably speak enough dialect to make himself ineligible to over half of Flanders if they wanted to
Plenty of words that are basically known to be from my little town for example and are rarely, if ever, used outside of it and completely unknown 5 towns over
Have you seen French grammar
There are a lot of differences between Dutch-Dutch and Flemish, but grammar ain’t one
Goeiedag
Ik ben Gerrik Callewaert uit Bavikhove, deelgemeente van Harelbeke
Ik ben West Vlaming en kzoen geren tvolhende zehhen
Ik zien da beu da West Vlamingen assan ondertiteld wordn op televisje
ik vinkik da echt een skande
I may be from a different place, but reading about how the grains were compatible with an orange in French on the back is also something I'd consider nostalgic
Oh my grandparents live in Limburg and speak the dialect, I've always found it something like a blend of standard Dutch and German (as someone who doesn't speak German) with the adative of the melodiousnes of the Limburgs accent
I'm not sure how it varies with that spoken in the Netherlands (if it is spoken), I think i've always considered it similarly unintelligible to West-vlaams which wouldn't be strange considering they're the outer ends of the country on our side
Ik kan echt elk woord verstaan
Ik vind zoiets echt leuk haha
Ook de groeten
I can understand the first half i think: we can test it, maybe you understand me
We are ??????
Is that a bit right
Doesn’t Luxembourgish also have a lot of French mixed into it
Sure, that's why I precised that I'm not a native Dutch-speaker
When I had Dutch at school, we learnt the Belgian pronounciation and the audios/videos were in Belgian Dutch, so, this is what I have been used to
You will never be exposed to Dutch from the Netherlands in French-speaking Belgium
So, it was a bit a "shock" to discover the sonority of Dutch Dutch, whose aesthetic is quite different ; but with time I guess I could understand it to the same level I can with Belgian Dutch
Not at all, Walloon is an entirely different language
No, not really
Kzien à oek gère zene
Ge hebt gelijk
Net zoals wij veel vaker 'gij' en 'ge' zullen schrijven in chats zoals deze zullen Nederlands snel 'nou' gebruiken, iets was een vlaming vrijwel nooit zal gebruiken
Late reply but I think, as a Flemish speaker, that Dutch Dutch sounds different, but we've heard it enough to adapt to speak in the most understandable way for them
If I speak to a Dutchman I'll automatically adapt my sentences and pronounciation to a more clearer version
If I don't know beforehand that one is going to be speaking Dutch Dutch and expect Flemish, it'll take about three sentences for me to lay the switch in my mind and actually understand what they're saying, after that it goes without issues
So i do get what you're saying
Generally though I'd say a lot of children's shows were spoken in Dutch Dutch so you're used to the sounds enough to not be troubled
thanks, I generally don't know much about regional accents or dialects in the Netherlands other than the most obvious ones
Ik dacht echt dat Afrikaans toch meer verschillend was van het Nederlands, maar blijkbaar niet
It helps that I know a tiny bit of German
'villäicht' really looks like 'vielleicht' for example
Ah nice that you can still understand it
I can speak French and pretty much understand German yet Luxembourgish is just about the right combination of both for me to not understand it at all
Gy zet toch e patéke e
that's off, if you were to also suggest Flemish our r 's actually roll in the far back of our throat and are not what I'd suggest hard, tho I suppose the Dutch (generalising I don't know too much about regional accents there) don't roll it as much or as far back so it's likely to sound harsher
It's more complex but people generally use it to refer to the Dutch spoken in Belgium
Belgian Dutch or Flemish Dutch are better terms in this regard
It's the same language as Dutch from the Netherlands
"Wel", of "nu"
"Nou" gebruiken voelt echt absurd aan voor mij
I suppose that's valid, otherwise they'd need a seperate government and we already worked so hard to get it down to six
Ende is also Middle Dutch for 'and' :D
Yes, German dialects like Swiss German and the German of Vorarlberg I believe also makes my head hurt
I also can’t hold that against them
My Dutch is also a dialect which can be hard to understand so I’m not really in a position to complain about others
More like grandpa, I'm a man as far as I know
Nou seg wat een tyfuszooi
^(Ben ik nu een volwaardige Nederlander
Might depend on the region, southwest of province Antwerp here (Maline)
So the easiest dialectial sounds I think, but it's how I and everyone around me does it, you gotta be far enough back that you can roll it like the tongue r, except in your throat
Yes but American English also sounds different from  English in the UK
It's the same language
Amai, wat een armoede
A group, that's a key word
The standard language (standaardtaal) is the same in Belgium and the Netherlands
My initial comment said it groups the dialects of Flanders
It also includes de standaardtaal
Wel, wel
Nah, I'm fluently a cunt in both Dutch and English
Sometimes I feel less awkward speaking English
Some everyday sentences just make me cringe in Dutch
Nice
Me too I guess
But have you seen [this jewel] though
West-Flemish in a nutshell ;)
For me it's even funnier because I'm from the same area, so my accent is exactly the same when I speak my dialect
Hatred is a word too exaggerated but I think only inhabitants of Brussels like the capital
People living in provinces feel more connected to the region they live in
Monaco and San Marino
Bruxelles is not particularly disliked by the common Belgian
I don't know most people i know quite dislike Brussels
The ones I know say quite the opposite in fact
I visited Luxembourg City a couple of weeks
So many construction sites
But so damn beautiful that city is
I loved it
So is molesting kids, and well
It depends on the part you live in
I studied in Groningen for a year and felt the same :) It misses  a lot to be considered a 'vibrant' city, except for younger students maybe
There isn't too much diversity (people, events, concert halls, etc)
I guess it has to do with the fact that it's far from other urban development without having the characteristics to be an attraction pole in its own right
For example, I'm quicker in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Rotterdam, or any bigger Dutch city coming from Belgium than coming from Groningen
Had a good time though, but the city itself isn't thát memorable
Yeah,  back in 2018 because of a immigration deal
Took us 2 years to get a new government lol
Have our governments ever collapsed
Hahahaha
\*reads it again\* HA HA HA HA HA HA
This is Belgium, mate
We're veterans
And in 2010 over BHV, and in 2008 over Fortis (which happened live on tv)
At least the Dehaene and Verhofstadt cabinets were more stable
Not that they weren't plagued by scandals and resigning ministers, but at least they didn't collapse
The Belgian government doesn't fall that often compared to many other European countries
It's just that WHEN it falls, the political parties are completely unwilling to form a new government
We have the most childish politicians of Europe
And the voters love it
Both Walloon and Flemish voters purposely vote for political parties that "don't do compromises". It's like the voters don't want a government
Actually we were
Nothing major happened, we could all go on with our lives in that time, and thats just the way we like it
If he was talking about the Palais de Justice (Law Courts of Brussels): I've never known it without scaffolds
Even the scaffolds were in scaffolds for a while
Belgian election results aren't more divisive than elsewhere
Many European countries are forced to have minority governments
It's just that in Belgium, parties refuse to approve minority governments
This gives the fake impression that Belgium is uniquely difficult to govern in, while in reality on paper it's just as difficult as any other country, it's purely unwillingness to do it like they do it abroad
I mean, we've got a couple of backup governments who deal with the shit we actually notice
> Nothing major happened
Except the pandemic
Just waiting for multiple layers of scaffolding and becoming a tourist attraction
I sure hope so, I wouldn’t imagine the mess it would make in a country which would have more per capita than we do
In Flanders it’s even seen as weird if you don’t know French and English
Being monolingual is pretty rare in Belgium
For starters, you would need to know French or Dutch to understand half of your fellow countrymen
If you live in Flanders, none of your english media is dubbed, just subtitled, so you pick up quite a lot as you go (I was already somewhat proficient in English before ever getting it in High School, due to consuming lots of English media and it being closely related to my mother tongue)
Here in Belgium, when you take ASO high school (which is the most theoretical, "highest" section of high school in Flanders), you're supposed to know at least four languages: Dutch, which is our native language, French, which they speak in Wallonia and is our second official language (we start learning it when we're about 10-11), English, which we start learning at about 14, and German, which is our third official language and which you start learning at 16 (in ASO)
In many schools you have the option of learning even more languages, my old school for example, gave the option Italian in your last year (when you're 17-18)
The "lower" sections of high school (less theoretical and traditionally viewed as less than ASO, even though that's stupid): TSO, BSO and BUSO, learn at least Dutch, French and English in high school (again, in Flanders
I believe that in Wallonia you have the option for Dutch, but its not mandatory like French in Flanders (not entirely sure about that, but many people say that here in Flanders)
But yeah, I turned 18 yesterday and I speak fluent Dutch, fluent English, decent French and not too bad German
(I went to ASO for 5 years, I'm currently dubbeling my 5th year in TSO
We have 6 years in ASO, most of TSO
A lot of BSO and a few TSO sections offer 7th years which are kind of mandatory if you want the full diploma)
In Belgium we should be able to speak the other main language, so the Flemish learn French, but the Walloons often don’t learn Flemish, which is kinda sad
We (Flemish) also learn English, and often take German classes
Kiev was a strange experience
Restaurants had on average one staff member who spoke English
One time they had to get someone from the kitchen to translate because my Russian was not good enough to understand the waiter's Ukrainian
I think I spoke all languages there just to find my way
Someone spoke French, another German, which I could make sense of
Now a random post office to buy stamps, that was a frigging adventure
Nobody spoke anything but Ukrainian, not even the people in line behind me
So in my best Russian я хочу две марку, пожалуйста. But apparently I needed six, for two postcards
Then my visa card didn't work (because they put it in backwards)
After I paid they ran off with my postcards, waving me off
Eventually the cards arrived at their destination but it was still a weird experience trying to figure it all out without Google translate
TL:DR Kiev was great
But next time I'm getting some mobile data to have Google translate (and maps) with me lmao
If you have interest in learning Norwegian, yesterday I happened to find Beginner Norwegian classes on the site Futurelearn
You can follow it for free, there are some drawbacks to the free version, like you can only access the class for 6 weeks or so and not for an unlimited time
But normally that time frame should be enough to finish the class
&#x200B;
As a Belgian, yes we would easily switch to English when speaking to a foreigner
To make the communication go better
It's a gesture of friendliness not to let you struggle while we're more than capable of talking to you in a language you're comfortable with
As a language learner myself I can understand that struggle
Generally what I do, is even if people greet me in the other language, I will respond in the local language
After a few times back and forth they generally get that I'm trying to practice
You could also say something like 'Is it okay if we speak ...? I'm learning it
" I think many people will respond positively to the the fact you have interest in their mother tongue
I don't understand the snobbish reaction, that's very unfortunate
The only way I could understand that is if you tried to speak French in Belgium but when you were in Flanders
Flemish people speak Dutch and generally speak way better English than French so it would be very strange to us if an English person tried to communicate in a language we both suck at instead of in English which is easier for both of us
Also they might feel slightly offended if they assumed that you didn't know the difference between Flanders and Wallonia and assumed that all Belgians speak French
But even then I don't think a snobbish reaction is appropriate though
I'm sorry you met the wrong people, most of us are normally not that rude (I would hope)
My Russian just isn't that great to keep up
I constantly had to ask people speaking it back to me to go slower or repeat
I learned a lot, but I noticed it too that languages outside of their own wasn't their strong game
Yeah I get the frustration
It's even more difficult because you know they do it to be helpful and you don't want to come over as disrespectful
This is very rude except:
-If you are helping them with cooking
-If they ask you to take something or if you asked for permission
-If you are at your sibling's, parents' or maybe best friend's house and you visit them regularly
-If you are a babysitter
It depends
If you're with family or a good friend it's no problem, at least if you have a reason to look in the fridge
With strangers or people you don't know well it's not appreciated
* ***France*** : their cuisine and food variety, how they preserved and promote their patrimoine/heritage/history, the nice architecture of many towns
A lot of literature too
In French-speaking Belgium we adopted and like a lot the ideals of the 1789 revolution
But specifically the 1789 ones, and some parts of the Napoleonic legacy/heritage
* ***Netherlands*** : their cycling culture, I wish it could be imported to Wallonia more (although, Wallonia isn't the most practical place to ride a bicycle, too many hills)
Some degree of social progressism, and openess towards sexuality
Probably where I would emigrate if I had to move to a neighbouring country, despite being a native French-speaker
* ***Luxembourg*** : their relative social progressivism too : free public transports, legal cannabis (not a smoker, but well, having it illegal is hypocritical when alcohol is legal)
A whole part of Wallonia used to be part of the Duchy of Luxembourg, and my father-side family is from the province of Luxembourg, so, there is a good deal of links between Wallonia and this country, even though the culture and languages aren't the same
* ***Germany*** : their industrial music, Neue Deutsche Härte, gothic music and neo-traditionnal music scene
Aside English, German is probably the language I listen to the most in music
And even if it is rather forgotten by both Wallonia and Germany, we spent centuries together as part of the Holy Roman Empire (from pre HRE in 843 to its foundation and until 1795
Our social security/welfare model is heavily inspired on the German model, and our relationship to power and politics today is a legacy from the HRE times
* ***United Kingdom*** : their humour, their movie industry, TV series, part of their literature (Stoker, Shelley, Mielville, Poe, Blake, Conan Doyle)
I like to listen to BBC 4 as well, BBC as a whole is a nice TV and radio channel, much better than French television in my opinion
I like their style/fashion as well, and how some places look like stuck in the 50's aesthetically/visually
I find interesting as well how their conservatives are less backward than continental conservatives : such as making same-sex marriage legal
Netherlands: that they are so innovative and they buy all the new stuff apparently (literally just learned about this yesterday)
There are like 20 times more electric cars and it's just way more modern in general
France: Amazing history, culture and places to visit
Luxembourg: Cheap gas
No, that they're more progressive socially
Germany: That they haven't invaded us in more than 70 years
The Dutch do have best free time\\ work time balance in the world
You guys are more organized and in some fields way more advanced than us
E.g. I study pharmacy and one of our professors keeps talking about things that are better in the Netherlands than Belgium
And of course bitterballen, stroopwafels and snackwalls
Well, I learnt something, ah
His style seemed so British to me
> I always forget about them
Lol, they're you're only actual neighbour if you don't consider a bridge as a border
How dare you
How dare you call it patat
Yeah totally, I can't drive home through Belgium
You van stop right there and still be correct
In Belgium we celebrate cailliau as the inventor of the internet
Thank you
Dries van Langenhove, an extremist right wing politician
We don't want or need him, pls take him Luxemburg
Gwendolyn (T)Rutten, she is just is the most moronic "liberal" and has successfully driven her party into the ground
Unfortunately, there are many people who do want him
I don't think we're going to get rid of him soon
It seems like 28% of Flanders does want him
I was looking for this
I don’t think everyone who voted VB is a fan of DVL necessarily, I have some VB-voters in my life and none of them like DVL
You need to prove that the name already exists
In the past, the name had to appear on some list somewhere or be derived from one of the names on that list
My grand-father had a colleague that was called Odil De Krok, so if you start with his last name it's De Krok Odil (the crocodile)
I feel bad for him but it's pretty creative and funny lmao
One that comes to mind for me is "Kim".
Male or female
Depends on culture
In mine it's female but there are places it's male
Same reason you wouldn't name somebody "hooker" basically
"Joseph Hooker (November 13, 1814 – October 31, 1879) was an American Civil War general for the Union"
Fun fact: there used to be 3 names in French which were written the same, boy or girl: Claude, Dominique and Camille
Obviously this changed in the last 40 years
Now there are several accepted gender neutral names
Never heard of that one
But a man named Anne would definetly be weird
Same for boys who are born today and who would be named Camille
Some name attributions definetly change over time
Depends on what you are looking for
pretty much all our musea are about a very specific subject
War, which war
Art, modern or classic
Science
Midieval musea
(Any castle really, I have fond memories of "Het Gravensteen in Ghent, but also about the Castle of Bouillon and the Citadel of Dinant)
I'm not into art and I often find war depressing so I'd go for science:
Museum for natural-science in Brussels (it has a great dinosaur collection aswell)
And even though Technopolis in Mechelen doesn't like to call itself a musuem but more of an "interactive-centre" for science and technology, it is great for kids to come into contact with both
I'd call it an interactive museum
Train World is the greatest museum I've ever visited
It is not at all boring and has some very cool stuff: Obviously lots of noteworthy locomotives and carriages from the past
But also interactive maps and info of the development of our railways, the beautiful station building of Schaerbeek, a railway set, simulator and even a real "seinhuis" (= signal house) that they didn't demolish but build the museum around
How crazy is that
I also liked the House of European History, specifically because it only asked questions and provide objective information
It specifically wanted to be apolitical and leaves visitors to make their own conclusions and opinions, which I really appreciated
It was also just a nice museum in a beautiful building and with some cool stuff
Honourable mentions are: the Museum of Natural Sciences and C-Mine in Genk
Also the Africa Museum which has been totally revamped
The exhibition now openly talks about the wrongdoings of the colonial era and also sheds a light on modern Congo
Do parents in your country sometimes talk in a different language if they want to discuss something without their children hearing it
Here in the Flemish part of Belgium, most parents tend to switch to French if they want to discuss something without their (small) children knowing about it
Mostly it is used to discuss bedtime, but it usefull for a great many things
For example, you might want to ask your partner which (unhealthy) dessert they might want after the kid goes to bed, without tempting your kid
Today, for another example, we used it while visiting a Zoo and to discuss if everyone was okay to leave before breaking the news to the kids
Children only learn French from about age 10 onwards so it's a usefull tool for a long time
We tend to learn several languages in our education, so we kinda take this option for granted, but I wondered if parents where you live also do this
Which language would you use apart from your native tongue
I live in Flanders too,  but my parents never did that
a lot of belgians here haha
and no my parents didn't do this
Yes
My grandparents used to speak in Flemish when they didn't want my ( french speaking ) father to hear something
Yes, but not so much than before
In the french part of Belgium, when adults/grand-parents wanted to talk about something without the children knowing, they talked Walloon
Since Walloon is not that common anymore we hear it less and less
But my mother and my grand-mother sometimes continue to speak it around my little cousins
I understand it now so it’s a bit useless “against” me
Exactly
My Flemish parents had heated discussions in French which is actually the reason I use French curse words to this day
I guess the example you give could happen in theory and I know both of my parents are proficient enough in French to do it, but they just never did
At what age do they start to teach Irish
Same here, my parents only know Dutch to my knowledge, never heard them use any other languages other than the odd basic English word from some song or smth
If they had something private to discuss, they'd go to the bathroom or hallway or something while we were eating or something
Quite common in my social circle (Antwerp region)
I figured everyone did this
Mine neither, then again I guess my father would understand as much as I did
But I myself did this yrick a few times when giving a youthcamp for asking the time, discussing whe´ to stop a game, etc
I remember my parents used to do this
Same here
Parents never spoke french
Just told us to go to the living room or our bedroom
My parents did it
Not only did they speak in French, but also in English
In my experience when switching to a different language it is 70% of the time snack related
aren't most hungarians monolingual
I figured most of Europe taught at least one foreign language
Anyway, don't think too much of our French proficiency
After school you tend to not use it for years unless you're on a holiday, or for rare reasons like this
There's very little cultural interaction between the two sides of the country
Dutch and English are I credibly closely related, more so than German and English
. Dutch is the easiest language to learn for English speakers
I'm from Antwerp as well, but I don't think I've ever heard of anyone doing that iirc
Basically no game(or much on tv) is translated in dutch
I remember back playing PS1 games and often it was like 4 big flags, English, French, German or Spanish
First generation of pokemon taught me a lot
Many moves including verbes and such
Here in Belgium we only begin learning English in 8th grade but the English teachers basically assume you know English
Bad times for immigrant kids sometimes because of it
Algerians will speak French at home for example so they tend to be bad at English
i've heard frisian is even more similar
i have no idea if that is true
yeah now that i think about it, in our english classes in flanders the teachers assumed you already knew english to an extent
it didn't start at zero
i don't remember people having much problems besides some moroccans but they managed to catch up
we started having english at school when we were 13 for the record
I'm from 91 and got the first generation pokemon games as soon as it came out
The place I was stuck on mostly was getting into the 6th gym town
Fuck knowing they needed a drink
One day I just accidentally passed them
Getting HM03/HM04 was another pain in the fucking ass but I was stuck there for so long I guess I got it in the end
I got past boulder cave without using flash
Pretty sure I had the HM for it too
Most fun experience with it was my first playthrough though
I just kept spamming A when learning a new move
So I ended up with 4 status moves on Pikachu
It is
They used to be one language
The differences between English and Dutch are tiny compared to other languages
I had so much issues learning English the first few years, because I really was starting at 0, and the handbooks and teachers weren’t.
The way you phrase that makes it seems like those 3 are the only games on the market :p.
Savescumming before having to choose an option untill it works out is how i finished Yellow and Red
Generally I'd say it's sweet depending on the setting, but usually tourists or people from the other side of the country either address in English or in French, it's nice to practice my own language learning though so not too bad either way
I'd love to help, it just depends on the time I have and the place we are in
In Belgium natives are happy when other natives speak their native language
Not my experience, in Belgium I'm considered quasi bilingual in Dutch and French but once in Paris the shopkeepers and staff will interrupt me and start in English very annoying
Had the same experience in Amsterdam when they hear a Flemish accent
I had just the weirdest experience with locals while studying abroad in France
I was following all of my lessons in French, so I obviously knew enough to have a normal conversation, and stuff like ordering food was no problem at all
However, whenever I ordered something, it must have been pretty clear that I was not a native speaker, because the server would instantly change to English (this happened more than once)
I appreciate the effort, but I understood them perfectly in French and it's obvious they have some trouble with English, so it just made the interaction harder for both of us
I've always felt it's normal to adapt to the person you're speaking to, a subconscious way for me to adapt is to go to a clearer standard Dutch if I'm in the Netherlands, same for children I try to speak clearer whilst older people I usually speak to with a heavier accent
So it's only natural to adapt to tourists or people learning the language to me aswell
My favorite one in Turkey was "Alles Gratis
Alles Gratis"
&#x200B;
that was thus a fucking lie
It depends like most things, but I don't think it's an issue if it's about things such as asking directions at all
Perhaps if you start a full on conversation in fluent French expecting them to be able to go along as easily but I think that's fairly logical
> The other thing that might happen occasionally, for some reason my accent in french sounds like flemish so people might switch to flemish
That might be because quite a few Flemish people don't take kindly to being addressed in French without being asked in advance, as if it's just taken for granted
It's a historic grievance
If they immediately switch to Dutch it's an assertive way to say 'you're in Flanders, we speak Dutch here'.
Ah well I see then, I suppose I depends on how you grow up treating dialects and such, I believe in general we just act different around dialects here
Either fries or waffles
Most Belgians would say fries but I think most non-Belgians would say waffles
So many to choose from
chocolate, stoofvlees, french fries, hop, etc
I guess I'd go for french fries because that's a smell you'll often smell just walking down the street
And dark chocolate
Too bad those don’t go together
As the other one said, dark chocolate or beer (Trappist maybe
) would work aswell, with dark chocolate being the most heavenly intense smell of them all (not saying fries or waffles don't smell good, but kinda hard to replicate on a smelling card)
Yes, so definitely fries
Edit: spelling
By the way, how do I edit the flag and land name like everyone here
My first thought was peanuts
Doesn't smell as good though
You know how to Belgium
Yeah true I just chose my 2 favourites from our country :)
Edit: and also because that's what you'll smell the most while walking in Belgium
(If you're on mobile)
Go to the subreddit
Press the 3 dots in the upper right corner
'Change user flair'
That's true, but I feel like the frietkot culture is a particularly Belgian thing that doesn't really exist in other countries
But fries are bad outside of Belgium and northern France, they don't know how to properly make them
French fries
Yes
Proper Belgian fries
Only in and near Belgium
So is chocolate, beer and basically any food or drink nowadays
>Yeah true I just chose my 2 favourites from our country :)
Those are good choices, so :)
>and also because that's what you'll smell the most while walking in Belgium
Bakeries too though
Those three are only surpassed by the beautiful and fresh smell of exhaust fumes
Ah finally, big thank you
Upper Northern France and Southern Netherlands too, bassically small towns near the Belgian border
It's basically in a region tightly surrounding Belgium
Zever gezever
Maastricht is de place to be
Experienced this when hitching through Spain to Porto
Got picked up by a guy from El Payo who just arrived by plane from his home in Eastern France
The village was filled with French Spaniards because it was summertime
During the year only 500 of a couple thousand actually live there
Beautiful little village, so sad
Went to see a little dam for electricity production nearby which got started but never finished somewhere in the 70s. I wouldn't wanna stay in a place with such corruption
Is it known to be a hub for software development
Why exactly would you like to go there
Is it nice, cheap, higher wages than Bosnia, ...?
I think it should be legal, but with certain restrictions
(Amount, location, age)
I like the idea of the coffee shops in the Netherlands where you can actually smoke in a safe space(?) It would be nice if there were places with experienced and professional staff that could comfort you in case of a bad trip
&#x200B;
I've smoked weed before, and I have nothing against it, but there are some people in my college dorm building that smoke every single day, and it's so annoying having to smell it everywhere/be bothered by high people all the time
Legal after having a smoker's license
How to get that license
-prove you have work and are useful in society
-prove you study and get a useful degree
-prove you didn't steel to buy it
Yes offcourse
There is no better hack than legalisation to put the streetdealers off side
Also it would be a new income of tax like sigarettes which I don’t have a problem with it
If you see to the US how much extra income they had by legalizing
All the politicians have a weong look on it as they grew up learning that drugs are bad
Which isn’t complety true as they use hallucogenes to takle depression an anxiety
It works better than some medicines that only enriches the pharma industry
Offcourse there are going to be problem cases just like with everything else (alcohol, coffee, perscription drugs, sugar)
The medical value is a double edged sword
I have seen some cannabis-induced psychosis and it isn't pretty
If this wasn't 'just' cannabis (with the entire lobby behind it) and instead a medicine developed by a pharmaceutical company, it would never get released to the public with the side-effects that cannabis has
No way
I'm still for legalization btw, punished addicts isn't helpful in the slightest
Nope, there will be to many taxes
You will pay 1g of outdoor thai 15€
*Moreover, during adolescence, cannabis is associated with increased psychiatric emergency department (ED) visits15,16 and increased risk for psychosis,17 with some research suggesting that it might as much as double the risk for psychosis and schizophrenia
18*
Double the risk for psychosis and schizophrenia
I have seen A LOT of CIP
I work with the mentally ill
My advice if you have any kind of mental problems (but certainly anything on the schizophrenic or psychosis scale): do not smoke cannbis
It will fuck you up double as hard
I don't have a problem with people smoking pot, I just don't like how it's almost treated like a herbal remedy
It's not
It has serieus potential side effects and nothing is said about it
Imagine if immodium came with these kind of side-effects
No way it would be legal to sell
I knew for a long time that the Dutch had claimed sealand to build on it when I was a kid
But I had the wildest theories on how they'd done it
First I thought they just built land that floats on top of it
Then when I saw the dikes I thought they mustered a lot of bulldozers and had pushed all at once
Then I was given a pretty bad explanation of how it's done so I thought they closed a part of the sea off then scooped the water away with buckets
I used to think that Greenland was almost as big as Africa (because of Mercator you know)
Also that Denmark bordered Norway, Sweden and Switzerland for some reason
And the strangest one: When people talked about Poland, I thought they meant the North Pole and the South Pole because in Dutch Poland = Polen and poles (as in both the north and south pole) = polen
It's the same fucking word
Edit: and also that Kaliningrad wasn't owned by anyone
Because in the maps in my school, it didn't get named
I thought it was just useless land that no one wanted lol
When i was a kid i thought Finland had Eskimos
As a child I always thought the French, Italians, spains and portugeese spoke the same language
I thought, when I was a child and before geography classes, that all the Balkan peninsula was Greece, with the norther borders of Croatia, Serbia, Romania being its northern border/included in it (since I had never heard of these countries)
Then I discovered that Greece was just a tiny part in the south of Balkan, and the existence of other countries there
I used to think countries where shaped as you wrote their name
Oh come on
And I used to think it was in Belgium because everyone just says the Dutch name: Duinkerke
I'm also a map (and flag) nerd
Although I don't know all the capitals, I know the place of every country on the world map and I know all the flags
scandinavia being different than the scandinavian peninsula is just asking for confusion
like vlaanderen that doesn't have it's municipal in o-vlaanderen or w-vlaanderen, but brussels in brussels, that isn't a part of vlaanderen
My recommendation would be Bergen, Copenhagen, Krakow, Vienna, Isola Bella (or in general the Borromean islands, not a city but very beautiful islands in Lago Maggiore  in northern Italy)
Edit: spelling
If you want to go from west to east, yes
I interpreted it wrong and assumed OP just meant you have to choose cities that aren't from the same part of Europe or the same country and north to south would be allowed too
Isn't it crazy expensive
I'm curious
The problem with any “brand” of coffee is that by the time you get it, it’s stale
Coffee is best consumed within 2 weeks of roasting it, at the very most 4 (which already clearly tastes less good) Espresso is a bit more forgiving with a darker roast, but wouldn’t push it beyond 6 weeks
The only real option to get this quality of coffee is to source it locally (which I prefer) or online with a roaster who puts a “roasted on” date on the package, or where you know the roast is maximum
a few days old (as is the case with one of my go-to roasters here locally, but I still always ask them)
I don't like how it tastes, it's very bland imo
So you studied art school in marseille
Not in my language, but when I was in Colombia, I remember someone said "sorry to molest you" because molestar is to bother/disturb in Spanish and he translated it thinking to molest is the same as molestar
Good thing I understand enough Spanish to understand the confusion
Same applies to dutch I think
"Ik ben zo opgewonden"(winded up would be the literal english translation) could easily be both understood as stressed, excited or aroused depending on situation
BUT
Without context it's understood as arousal
Not really
I'm one of the last millenials
Because I'm still studying at 25, I have a lot of contact with students of Gen Z. They're supposed to be a different generation but I hardly notice any differences compared to students from 1993-1995 when they were 18-19
why not
you go to the ghost, ask their name and adress, move on to the next ghost
easy
Yeah same everyone says it constantly
Really, is IJ a name
Oh ok
I thought a name for a person lol
I know the Dutch can have weird names but IJ is weird, even for you guys
Green olives definitely
They are easier to find in shops that the black ones
Cant speak for the entire country, but i feel like its about equal here
Definitely green
Even in mixes they try to favour the green one
For some reason people in general seem to prefer green olives over here
Don't know why though, both taste good to me
Their Instagram is also S tier
And their clothes/goodies are way nicer than the Nasa one
Man I almost cried :(
In Belgium, once you are in Wallonia (3
6 million inhabitants) or Flanders (6
6 million inhabitants), it's like living in a monolingual country
Everything will be in either French in Wallonia or Dutch in Flanders, and nowadays, few people really learn the other language or continue to learn it/speak it after secondary school
The only place that is somehow multilingual is Brussels region (1
2 million inhabitants), even though French dominates, and you'll hear English more often than Dutch
However, speaking Dutch will be a requirement for many jobs there
I think it's annoying (I'm Flemish)
No offense to Walloon people but we have different mentalities
We have different newspapers, different tv stations, different political parties and even different governments (we have like 3 ministers for everything)
Wallonia always votes left, Flanders more liberal/right
That's why our federal government never functions the way it should
In 2010 we took the world record of being the longest without a government from Iran, it took us 541 days to form a government
At the moment we are on our way of breaking our own world record again (and corona is not the reason for this)
One of the only things holding our nation together is our national football team
We have a royal family but no one particularly likes them since we never hear from them and they are just very boring
In Flanders we have to learn 8 years of French in school (10-18y)
In Wallonia they don't have to learn Dutch in school (they can choose between Dutch, German & English I think)
So ofcourse no one chooses Dutch since it's less spoken
Even in Brussels, where everything should be Dutch and French, they don't understand Dutch in a lot of stores
The French of the younger generation in Flanders is not as good as it used to be since we only hear Dutch and English on tv/radio
I live 20min drive away from the Flemish/Walloon border and I don't know anyone there
It really just feels like a different country
Here in Flanders where the majority of people live we learn French at school but in Wallonia where the minority lives they can choose to learn Dutch but few people actually do it
So the system is broken, and lot of people feel the same way
Even suggesting to replace the mandatory French with more English is somehow seen as insulting and bad
It's really fucked up
Belgium has super strict laws to protect each community's language
This means a flemish community absolutely cannot help you if you speak French or the other way around
All official statements are also in Dutch, French or German in their respective communities
The base of this law is the marginalizing of the Dutch-speaking community in the past
Because education is a competence of the communities, each community gets to decide what each student should know at the end of their education
The Flemish community decided to start teaching French at age 10, as a mandatory first foreign language
However, the Walloon community give their students the option to choose between Dutch, English and German
And almost all of them choose English
As a result, most Flemish can speak some French, while most Walloons speak pretty terrible Dutch
And this goes all the way to the top, there are plenty of Walloon ministers on the federal level who's Dutch is downright terrible (honestly, I can't say much about the German community as there's not a lot of politicians from that area who go federal)
Luckily, each statement by the federal government is in all  three official languages
All laws also have an official translation in Dutch and French, but the German translation is usually unofficial
As a side effect, the current press conferences about the coronavirus are horrible
The slides that accompany each conference switch back and forth between Dutch and French and you have to be proficient in every language to get everything
The prime minister's Dutch is also quite bad, leading to a lot of animosity along the Flemish
Come check out r/belgium, where the official language is
english, because it would be unfair to the other communities if we picked one
Dutch, French and German posts are allowed though
The famous Belgian compromise
PS: Belgium has three communities, the Flemish, the Walloon and the German community
The German community is the smallest, representing only 1% of the community, next is the walloon community, representing 31,8% and the biggest is the Flemish community, representing 57,6%. The 11% unaccounted for is Brussel, because it's bilingual and the Belgium Bureau for Statistics doesn't track languages, only residence
You should know most of Brussels is French
So we have three languages in Belgium: Dutch, French and German
While I do have some French on me I don’t speak a word of German (I can understand some of it because it’s sometimes similar to Dutch) so yeah I can’t communicate with every Belgian
I also think in Belgium we have a very different culture between Flanders and Wallonia, which I think is neat but means some people would like to split up
Political-wise it’s a mess however
We are such a small country but we have 6 governments, and also very different political tendencies
Wallonia tends to be more left-wing while Flanders unfortunately leans to the right
The federal government is bilingual
ETA: In Flanders it is mandatory to learn French at school (from the age of 10), but in Wallonia it’s optional to learn Dutch
Belgium is a construction of two countries that share some political matters, in almost all areas there is a divide between the French and Dutch speaking part
Wallonia, the French part, seems to follow France in all possible aspects while Flanders, the Dutch part, is rather more a stand alone country, but sets the Netherlands as an example
In the past, Wallonia used to be more prosperous and wealthy so many Fleming worked there and could hold a (basic) conversation
Nowadays, French knowledge has seriously decreased however the Flemings still better speak French than the Walloons speak Dutch
Even in Brussels most people are not even close to bilangual
Yes if you want to work for a big company it will be a requirement
But for "normal" jobs it mostly is just seen as a plus
I'm dutch speaking living in Brussels, my French is decent but far from fluent
Whenever I'm in restaurants or something I always ask if they speak Dutch (dutch Is an offiacial language in brussels, 4/5 cases they'll look at me weird and try to speak a few word and I will switch to French
Even in the city hall/police station of my own municipalitiy, next to no one speaks dutch
The dutch speaking schools are packed with French speaking people, which I, as such, don't have a problem with, but they don't actually want to learn dutch, they just speak french and assume you do to and they look down on us, they call us "les Flamands" (even when I don't really identify as Flemish) and it really divides our schools and limited the people I could be friends a lot
It sucks
I believe English is spoken on all 6 of the islands (and Dutch is barely spoken)
But on the ABC islands, the most common language is Papiamento, a weird Portuguese-Spanish-Dutch creole I believe
> In Wallonia they don't have to learn Dutch in school
That is not true, many schools in Wallonia have mandatory Dutch
I had, and it was a public school ; was in ASO for the record
I've more than once heard Wallonians say that Flemish people are barbarians which is actually really fucking insulting considering the state they are currently in themselves
A mix of English, French and Dutch as I seem to understand it
Our coach is Spanish, so I'm guessing they will all speak English
Most of our football players are very good at speaking different languages since they all play abroad (UK, Spain, Germany
I think they speak both Dutch and French on the pitch since they can all understand both
No idea, I really don't care about football, so, I'm unfortunatly not the best person to whom such a question should be asked ;-)
I started going alone to school by bike or on foot when I was about ten
This was in the Dutroux era
It was only a kilometre though, in a mid-sized city
Not well, I’ve heard some medieval Dutch (van den vos Reynaerde and Walewein) and I can understand it a little but not much at all
The general sounds have stayed the same but most other things have changed
I think the transition from unreadable to slightly understandable is around the transition from early middle ages to late, probably not entirely coincidental with the growth of cities after the 1000s. Trying to read the original manuscripts is downright impossible though, the alphabet also changed quite a lot
I find "Karel ende Edelgast" from 1270 pretty intelligible, but the text is from Brabant and so am I.
I understand a lot of Walloon but it's hard to trace back it's history
We have some origins from around 900 and it was the main language until WWI
Unfortunately it's hard to find written proofs (Latin became the used language instead of Celtic languages)  so we don't know how it was originally
As someone who speaks West Flemish, those old Dutch fragments are understandable
It's like reading a text from another West Flemish speaker who is from a different region
You can understand most of it but some words are just different
Edit: I read it again and the last sentence however is pretty difficult to understand
to me Karel en de Elegast was quite understandable, but mileage varies i suppose
any older than that is just a different language tough
I don't think it's all that fair to use the Hebban olla vogola text to judge how comprehensible Old Dutch was, after all it was a form of old West Flemish and all of you still struggle to understand even the modern forms of it :p
&#x200B;
that being said, coming from West Flanders the text is perfectly understandable over here
Icelandic has got a lot of sound changes, like any language, but they are so consistent, which is why modern Icelandic text looks so much like Old Norse
An obvious example is the Icelandic plosives: they all became voiceless
The g also turned into a bunch of different sounds
Also the difference between i and y is gone
I think Vikings would still be able to communicate with modern Icelandic people
They could also somewhat communicate with the Saxons that arrived in England, after all
Yes, you are right
There has been a lot of dialect levelling on the mainland, whereas Iceland has experienced less of this simply because it is so small in comparison
Yes ! I don't understand how people keep mixing 'to agree' with 'etre accord' when the verb 'agreer' exists in French with a similar meaning
In Dutch it is both correct
"Een foto nemen" (take) or "Een foto maken" (make) are both correct standard Dutch, but in Flemish (Belgian non-standard Dutch) we often say "Een foto trekken" (pull/draw/take)
That one is less common here, but true
I never heard that one before
Bokken en kemels worden al eens geschoten in Vlaanderen
Soms ook in een franse colère, of uit z'n krammen
Iets kan ik ook een lichaamsdeel schieten
Maar een foto ? Niet echt
In Dutch that would probably translate to 'momenteel' or 'op het moment' but 'actuel' would translate to 'actueel'.
> until our teachers told us to shut the hell up
Belgian teachers can relate
Anyways, I went to the USA last year and it was literally full of Dutch people, it was crazy, I heard Dutch literally EVERYWHERE
We were visiting this national park and I was talking to my mom (in Flemish aka Belgian Dutch) and suddenly these 2 Belgian teenage girl screamed “OMG, ARE YOU BELGIAN
” in Flemish
We were like “uhm yeah
” and they continued screaming: “FINALLY
The states is literally FULL of Dutch people, we’re so happy to finally encounter fellow Belgians
” Weird but funny, also gave us some strange looks from Dutchies
Not sure, but I think it was Zion
>And also Asereje by Las Ketchup
Here it's know as "The Las Ketchup Song"
Yes, the things mentioned are : date of birth, sex, nationality (and names obviously)
Ours cards are electronic, so, there is a chip with more informations that a computer with card reader can access to
In Belgium, having an ID card is compulsory/mandatory by law as soon as you are 16, and legally, you can't go out without it
We have one, it's basically a very neutral looking piece of plastic with some data, a chip, and some other security features on it
Sex, not gender
They are different things
In between the __17th__ and __18th__ century Ghent was the biggest city (if we are just looking at the region of current day Belgium)
Somewhere in the middle of __19th century__ this changed
After that I don't know up until __1983__, during that year we fused a lot of towns and cities together and Antwerp has been the biggest ever since, as it instantly multiplied its population by a factor of __2
5__.
That is if we are going by __city__ and not __metropolitan area__
Currently the biggest __cities__ are: Antwerp > Ghent > Charleroi > Liège > Brussels
By __metropolitan area__ it would be  Brussels > Antwerp > Ghent ...
Edit: formating and clarity
1600 : Ghent
1700 : Antwerp
1800 : Antwerp
1900 : Antwerp
Today : Antwerp
(For the record the 5 biggest cities today are Antwerp, Ghent, Charleroi, Liège and Brussels)
Paris was the largest city in Europe full stop for most of the middle ages
Looked it up today
Still dwarfed by Chinese cities at the time though
Meanwhile, Antwerp had
105 000 citizens in 1567
84 000 in 1584
And 46 000 in 1591
IIRC the language/dialect spoken in the early 17th century in Amsterdam was Antwerpian
Antwerpen was never part of the Netherlands to begin with, it was part of the Duchy of Brabant ... Your country didn't exist until 1581
Yea, this is one of those questions of bureaucracy mostly
Recently learned that say, Tokyo is basically several cities in one and all that and can hardly be called one city
If we sort the [agglomerations] by population, it is :
Brussels > Antwerp > Liège > Ghent > Charleroi > ...
1000 - 1550: Mostly Ghent, with peaks for Ieper around 1250 and Bruges around 1400
1550: Antwerp
1600: Brussels
1700: Probably Antwerp (due to the French bombardment on Brussels five years earlier), but both Brussels and Ghent would overtake it again soon
1800: Ghent
1900: Brussels or Antwerp, hard to say which of the two had a larger agglomeration (Antwerp was the larger municipality)
Today: Brussels (although Antwerp is the largest single municipality)
Liège came close a few times, but I can't find any evidence to argue it was ever the largest city of modern day Belgium
It might've been Tournai in the early Middle Ages
>Antwerpen was never part of the Netherlands to begin with
Except much later ofcourse
but that doesn't matter to their point though
They said it changed when a significant part of Antwep moved to Amsterdam, they didn't say Antwerp was the biggest before that
Fun fact: kuttenberg means cunt mountain in Dutch
Haha
>16th century
But sadly the Spanish had to ruin it
The order is true but the numbers seem wierd when you use the Belgian definition
Antwerp was about 1
2m and and Brussels 1
6m in 2017
The city of Brussels is rather small actually
People just confuse the region of Brussels and neighbouring towns of Brussels with the city of Brussels
Molenbeek for example is often denoted as part of Brussels and if you are talking about the metropolitan area or the region of Brussels, then this is true
But it isn't part of the city of Brussels
The city of Brussels is a rather small municipality
It represents only a fraction of the agglomeration
No, I dislike when they appropriate things that are not theirs
The Belgian definition
[Here] is the source of citypopulation
[Here] an article of the Cairn about Belgian agglomerations
Both only in French sadly
Tbh, I either never heard of it or I forgot about it
I'm from Antwerp and we learned about the 80 year war mostly through they eyes of the city of Antwerp and as a war between protestantism and catholicism
No not really
After the initial revolts that took place all over the 17 Provinces, the most southern provinces, in a pretty logical manner, ended up siding with the Spanish after a while since the roots of the revolt simply didn't run as deep there and they where predominantly catholic after all
That's the way we learned it as far as I can remember
Probably with a small surgue during the Napoleon era and then the small part where we fused with the Netherlands again
I'm Flemish, my French isn't good enough to read those sources properly
>The Belgian definition
Every country holds different definitions for agglomerations
For example, in 2011 when using the European defenition there was a massive agglomeration that contained a big chunk of Flanders (including Antwerp), Brussels and some linear settlements all the way into Wallonia
It had a population of 5
2m, because they were all connected through linear settlements
Edit: [source for the above]
In Belgium we define two types:
*Big cities* and *regional cities*. (I'm not going to define the properly here)
The five cities we mentioned earlier are the only ones seen as big cities while Louvain, Bruges and Verviers (for example) are seen as regional cities
If you use the Belgian definitions and the population numbers of each municapality from the 2017 for each of the five "Big cities". You get that Antwerp has 1
2m and Brussels 1
6m and the rest below 1m.
You definitely just forgot about it
The Union of Atrecht are basicaly the catholic regions that sided with the Spanish, while the Union of Utrecht were the protestant regions at the time of their creation in 1579
Most regions of present day Flanders were part of the Union of Utrecht, but obviously the situation quickly changed after the Fall of Antwerp in 1585
Yeah I looked it up before my comment, but I don't recall ever hearing about it before
At first I even thought Atrecht was a typo
I feel like we're having a little misunderstanding here
Like you and I both said, the initial revolts took place all over the 17 Provinces with some regions more fiercely involved than others
When I was talking about the 'most southern provinces' I was referring to the county of Artois and the county of Hainaut AKA the counties that made up the Union of Atrecht, which our Dutch friend was talking about
Flanders and Brabant were part of the Union of Utrecht but did indeed later get conquered by the Spanish and thus became predominantly catholic as most of the protestant population fled north whereas Hainaut and Artois were already more catholic to start with
So yeah, understandable misunderstanding I guess
I should've been more clear with the whole southern provinces thing given the end-result of the war
Haha yeah it's one of the main reasons I really remember it
Always thought it was kind of funny that you have two battling factions called the Union of Atrecht and the Union of Utrecht
But hey maybe you did indeed just not learn it
I thought you might have because I live in Sint-Niklaas so we also had a pretty large focus on the things that happened in Antwerp back then, but we still learned about it
Figured the programs might've been similar
I honestly don't know how it began initially
I had an American friend in the South of France on holiday when I was 8 or so I talked English with already
Games kept improving my English
By age 13 I was reading English books(looked for something to read in the car and found an English book) and by age 16 I was on Ventrilo leading raids in Karazhan with most being surprised I wasn't British later on
I generally don't remember learning English in general except for a single word
A loading screen for Age of Empires II contained "plains". Through context I figured out what it meant(and that it wasn't planes) and it stuck with me ever since
But that's the only English word I can remember consciously learning
Since I was 6 years old I already played some games on the Nintendo
Those were in English, but tbh I barely knew any English
When I was 13, I started getting English at school
At the same time I got a PS4 and played games on there that were in English
I started watching some Dutch YouTubers, but they use a lot of English vocabulary
Like a year later I started watching English YouTubers and I started using the internet way more
Programs weren't dubbed so things shows like Dinosaurs or Third Rock From The Sun helped with a basic understanding
Plus video games, they weren't localised (so no Dutch version), dad got me and my brother GTA III when I was 8 so
Around age 10 (around '05) my older brother showed me Runescape
I played it, introduced it at my school even
Good times
That shit taught me so much English (and real life skills like don't get scammed or follow strangers into the wildy)
My parents are from different countries, one Flemish and the other from Pakistan
They spoke English with each other thinking I didn't understand
It's weird how babies work
They just absorb whatever you throw at them
So I have very little memory of actually learning English
I do have a vague memory where I'm just beginning to learn to read and my parents hand me a text in English to see if I can read it
I just learnt how to read Dutch but I was already reading English fluently as well just by deduction of what it must sound like
English has a lot of phonemes that are pronounced different than they're written, so that was a process but still
I basically figured it all out at a very early age
Television in Flanders is never dubbed, always subtitled
Spending hours after school watching The Fresh Prince, Friends, The Simpsons, Full House, etc helped
Because of that my accent is completely American to the point where Americans assume I'm American sometimes
Then there's the internet which consumed whole chunks of my life, and which is I believe 90% in English
(I was reading this article about languages on the internet that says: "a survey published by Unesco in 2008 found that [98% of the internet’s web pages ] published in ] [12 languages] and more than [half of them are in English] -[The many languages missing from the internet ] Miguel Trancozo Trevino 15th April 2020 )
So am I a native speaker
My parents' pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary was terrible but I do indicate native speaker on forms and cv's because it's been part of me since before I can remember
I don't know, what's the rule there
I watched a lot of television as a kid
We don't dub programs and most of the shows are American
I think the Simpsons really taught me to speak English
I'm not bad at languages and by the time I had my first English lesson (14 I think
) I had enough knowledge to just fill in the book in a week and be bored for the rest of the year
I also enjoy reading, and enjoy reading in English
I think about 60% of the books I own are English
Very rarely does a writing style not resonate with me, most of the time I enjoy it pretty good
Reddit did helpt me to realize that it's not easy to express yourself fully in a foreign language
There's a lot of nuance that you can't express or sometimes I'm writing a sentence and I notice that my train of thought doesn't really translate very well
English is funny in that way
I guess it kinda started around 10 years old cuz i used to play runescape
Didnt have english classes until i was 13 tho, went on to a bachelor as english teacher
Didnt finish it tho
For me what worked the best was games and subtitles
I learned more english from the old x-men cartoon then from anything else, and after that gaming helped
I'm told my older sisters and brother taught me how to read a bit when they did
Reading slowly,  i couldn't read all the subtitles
But i compared the first words odd every line to what the people on tv were saying
And that was that
Must have been about 4 or 5
Once my mom found out,  she stimulated the hell out of it and got me some kids books and stuff
Subtitles are the best
English started in highschool at around 13-14 years old but I was already fluent because I grew up playing Guildwars which forced me to learn English and ask my dad to translate certain things
Best way to learn a language is by using it constantly
I even followed my courses in English even though I had the choice to follow them in dutch
TLDR: in Belgium it's possible to do erasmus to another school in Belgium
&#x200B;
I'm Belgian and our country has different language communities  which have separate governments and education is under their jurisdiction so it is possible en done by some but you can go to the opposite language university then your original
giving you an erasmus in your own country
But it can be worse Brussels is a 2 language zone so you can go there to a dutch speaking uni and go on erasmus to a french speaking one without changing city
in case of the VUB and ULB it's even on the same campus .
I did my Erasmus on Svalbard
Interesting place for sure to spend almost half a year
I did my Erasmus in Umeå (in the north of Sweden) during the winter months
It sure was an experience, didn't see a lot of sun in the beginning :)
I was also thinking about this
So surreal ahah
Well you would want to go to a university that offers courses which fit your program, no
For example I'm getting a masters degree in Biology with a thesis oriented toward molecular biology / genetics
If I would go on Erasmus I'd choose a place that has a strong molecular biology program
Sure you want to go to a nice place you haven't seen before, but you still want to pursue your educational goals right
Also Erasmus outside of Europe is a lot less subsidized so it costs you personally a lot more money
atleast that is kinda  different experience
belgium is a very small country and it is a full legit erasmus
In most cases you are but the KU Leuven offers some courses in English and those are usually packed to the brim with Erasmus students
The only thing that died over there was my bank account ;)
Another fun fact: They actually do have a cemetery in Longyearbyen
It's only symbolic though and no bodies are buried over there
Last time they tried this the bodies started to reappear on the surface after a few months because the permafrost pushes everything upwards
Fun times assured
I went to Barentsburg (Russian settlement) and Pyramiden (an abandoned town with only 6 inhabitants left)
Besides that I also did a lot of activities in and outside of Longyearbyen
I gotta admit, it did feel weird to know that you’re living in the northernmost town in the world and that this was basically the end of civilization with only wilderness around you
Kinda cool tho :D
I think the reason I don't really get that might be because I travel a lot by default
I can take a month off and decide to take the camper from Belgium to the Black Woods for a bit, travel to Switzerland and end up somewhere in the South of Spain
These things aren't really an experience for me
They're just life
Being "somewhere else" just doesn't do much for me
Speaking as somebody who could wait with graduating and everything(sister just did at 27, there simply was no hurry or pressure on her to do so, she took a break for 2 years to raise dogs for example) there are plenty of people who can't exactly go and do that as well
I fully agree, but then an Erasmus doesn't seem like the best way for me since it's still centered around education
If travel is what you really want, then follow your dreams and travel
You can indeed always focus on your career, so grab the opportunities you have in your 20ies :) whether it's Erasmus, gap year, volunteering, ... I for example took a gap year between my bachelors and masters and made 3 large trips to South America and Asia
Sure, not the same as living there, but a lot of time to go around and explore
I just wanted to make clear with my original comment why some people might choose a destination that doesn't seem as interesting
It doesn't work well for individuals, but you can often guess where a group is from
If you see people with very outdoorsy clothes and deuter backpacks, those are germans
I'm pretty sure I can spot a Dutchie just on sight
But I'm never going to be able to prove it, because usually you hear them coming before they are in visual range
You can tell I'm more Germanic because of my face but then you still couldn't say if I'm from Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria
Purely by looks you can't do much more than guess imo
[This] shows average faces of women around the world
The western and southern european ones (nationalities of which I've seen many people) all made me go 'oh yeah, she really does look like she's from there'.
Came here to look if a Finn left this kind of reply
We truly are easily recognizable
Round face, pale skin, light hair, a certain face structure, similar to people in Eastern Europe imo
We look really young too, something which I hope I will someday be happy about
Really
To me, Dutch people are quite easy to tell apart ... they have Dutch faces
Lol I feel personally attacked  yeah I guess round faces lack edges the same way edgy faces lack roundness
But I don't think any face "lacks" anything
Flanders as well tbh
Oh okay thank you  there are just lots of people who feel insecure about their round face because it makes them look so much younger
That can be really annoying sometimes
My GF and I recently switched over to bar soaps instead of liquid soap in plastic containers
You can find bar soaps for shampoo and conditioner as well
ie Lush
The reason why mostly supermarkets selling bread use paper bags with plastic windows (for lack of a better word) is that cashiers can see what's inside without having to open the bag
Benefit : not opening is faster ==> more clients per hour ==> less cashiers needed ==> savings on salary
The bread is fresh in supermarkets, so no barcode
You cut the bread and put it in a bag yourself
You have different bags for different sizes of bread but not for different types of bread so the prices can still differ
"To pull your plan" both exists in Belgian Dutch 'zijn plan trekken' and in Belgian French 'tirer son plan' (not sure about the German speaking community)
It means something like 'to manage', 'to fend for oneself', 'to figure it out for oneself'
Examples:
*-Someone has a plan to do something but you don't agree with it and don't want to join
You can tell them 'pull your plan'. Basically 'do it yourself', 'figure it our for yourself'.*
*-You have to go to a place you've never been to before and you friend is worried "Are you sure you're going by yourself, I can join you if you want
" "No, no need, I'll pull my plan, I'll be fine
" \[I'll figure it out\]*
*-Two moms who's kids were sent out to do something
One mom is very worried
The other says: "Hey don't worry, they'll pull their plan
They're old enough and they're with two
" \[They'll figure it out, they'll manage, they can fend for themselves\]*
&#x200B;
We even have a noun for the person "een plantrekker' (not sure if a French word exists for this)
Someone who can figure things out for themselves and always finds a way to get things done or make things work in their advantage
\[ Sometimes it could be used in a negative way to tell that someone always finds a way out of their responsibilities/duties
We also have the idea of 'A (good) Belgian pulls their plan
' or 'In Belgium we pull our plan
'. So we have the idea that a Belgian person can generally figure a problem out for themselves
I'm not sure if this is used in the Netherlands or not and if it's even used all over Flanders, but where I live there's the expression: **It's like an angel pissing on my tongue/it's like an angel pissing in my mouth
** *(Als een engeltje die in je mond/op je tong piest)* It means that something tastes really good
I hate this one so much
I have a vivid imagination and whenever my mom uses this expression, I just cringe, it seems disgusting
**Promise makes debt/promise creates debt** *(belofte maakt schuld)*: If you make a promise, you need to keep it
**Even accounts make good friends
** (Not sure if that translation was any good, the original: *Effen rekeningen maken goede vrienden
*) On a financial level, it's good to have clear agreements with your friends, it's best if neither side is in debt with the other one, that's the best way to keep a good friendship
My favorite is probably "staring the cat out of the tree". It is used when someone waits instead of taking action
I can add that "Das ist mir Wurst/wurscht
" also has a Dutch counterpart in "Het zal me worst wezen", which means the same thing
Parler Anglais comme une vache Espagnole really made me laugh
I didn't need to read the meaning of the expression, it is so clear and beautifully worded
I never realized how weird this was
Haha love how literally you translated it
I'm a pro plantrekker and proud of it
Yeah, I didn't know how to translate it but I thought that going litteral here would be the best for this thread
Though 'pulling your plan' sounds freaking weird in English, it doesn't make any sense
I think in France you say 'se débrouiller' instead
I'm not French speaking myself so I don't come into contact enough with French variations to really know where people use what
But I think it's not that strange that it differs
As a Flemish Dutch speaker there are so many differences between the Dutch in Belgium and in the Netherlands, so it wouldn't surprise me at all that there are also many differences between Wallonian French and French French
I also read somewhere that 'tirer son plan' came from the Flemish expression, so influence of Flemish Dutch on French in Belgium
Like I've heard French speaking people in Brussels use the word 'dikkenek' (meaning braggart), which is obviously a Dutch word, not sure if it's also used in Wallonia
I also heard that the expression 'à tantôt' is Belgian French (meaning: see you later today), maybe you could confirm/deny if this is used in France
Haha yes
As a Flemish teacher in a school in Molenbeek, I yell: 'Tirez votre plan
' alot when they keep talking while I try to explain something
Just translated it literally, had no idea if they used it in French
I'm not a 100% sure, because I'm not a native French speaker, maybe some Wallonian scrolling along can confirm or deny
But I think in Belgium when saying  à tantôt  it implies that you'll see each other again on that same day
[Het Groene Boekje ftw]
Yes,always the anglo-saxon people outside Europe
They thought that I speak belgian haha
I've only met one guy in my life that was really aware that French was spoken somewhere else than France
He was a salesman in NYC
He even asked me about the differences in "Belgian French" vs French
Most people ask me what does "Belgian" sound like because they've never heard it
A lot of people don't even know Belgium is a country and since I'm a French-Speaker, they just say "ah oui oui baguette are you from Paris
At least equally commonly they inform me that in Belgium in fact multiple languages are spoken
Some other misconceptions that are rather frequent:
French is the majority language but there is a small Dutch minority
French and German are the only languages of Belgium
The Dutch, French and German communities are equal in size
All of even most Belgians are keen on ripping the country apart
Belgium is a part of either the Netherlands or France
By relief, this one is uncommon
TIL people also speak German in Luxembourg
As a Belgian I feel like I should have known this
I'm astonished that people thought more about German than Dutch when it's coming to our languages
Like I mean, I don't even know a single german translations to our cities !
Not even close
Every time they measure the amount of people in favour are under 20%.
The German community in Belgium is smaller than some communities that aren't officially recognised
Belgium is so complicated, man
Just a few villages surrounding Brussels
That's a disingenuous way to put it
There is a majority government that would work in every province but Antwerp
The parties refuse to do it because they argue there needs to be a majority in Antwerp
Useless polticial games
It's just that Wallonia ussually votes left and Flanders votes right
Also, the biggest party in Flanders now refuses to step into a government with a Flemish minority of seats
(Which makes sense imo because Flanders has by far the mayority of people)
> Just a few villages surrounding Brussels
Is where there is a *majority* of francophones
I can't speak for the rest of Flanders but you'll find a decent amount of native francophones in the province of Antwerp as well
Also some small region in West-Flanders
Also a dutch region in Walloon in the East somewhere
> Also, the biggest party in Flanders now refuses to step into a government with a Flemish minority of seats
(Which makes sense imo because Flanders has by far the mayority of people)
If you want to  count that srt of things, the last governement had only one wallon governement and was definitely not representative of wallonia
I say we accept it because its a *federal governement* not a coalitions of the régions
Why is the biggest minority so important
The only place where the coalition without the nationalist doesn't have a majority is Antwerp
Why is one province more important than the others
The previous government with the nationalists didn't have a majority in most provinces
It wasn't an issue then
No I mean the villages surrounding the Capital region
I don't know their opinion about it, but flanders sure as hell wouldn't allow it
Those communes were part cause of a major political crisis for years, in fairly recent memory and caused our sixth state reform
[More info on wiki]
>you'll find a decent amount of native francophones in the province of Antwerp as well
I live there
Its probably the province with the least francophones since there is no border with Wallonia
In waht Antwerp cities do you think these francohphones live then
Exactly
The previous government didn't have a majority in any French majority provinces
The current coalition created this week has a majority everywhere except Antwerp
Oh I know I'm just saying one of the reasons why it takes so long right now
I personally don’t like it there, but Knokke is pretty well known (especially amongst rich people)
They tried (with the emphasis on tried) turning it into Saint Tropez 2
Keith Haring used to go there a lot, though
If you want tall old grey buildings right at the edge of the sea then Belgium has a treat for you
Depressing as fuck
Yet the beaches are loaded with people on any somewhat warm day
Yeah, our "kust" is not really anything to look at
But the childhood memories make it treasurable
The Westhoek is nice too
Zeeland is where the Kiting's at
I go to Brouwersdam anytime conditions allow
Thanks for having me :)
You got that right :)
[Envoi] by Absinthe Minded is definitely a banger
I dont know if it's known outside Belgium, it should be
That or [Adolescence Blues ] by Equal Idiots
Edit: added links
For me, that would be [Yevgueni - Nieuwe meisjes (new girls)] It's has a really catchy folkish tune that I really like
Also [Faces on TV - Love / Dead]
Singing in English: Equal idiots (garage rock)
Singing in Dutch: zwangere guy (rap)
Singing in French: Stromae (mainly hiphop/electro)
Singing in German: I don’t know
I really like Loïc Nottet
He has a very unique voice
Maybe you know him because he performed at the Eurovision song contest in 2015 with [Rhythm Inside]
Every song of him is different
He sings what he likes, mostly in English
Some examples:
[Heartbreaker] (pop song)
[Million eyes] (powerballad maybe
I don't know)
[Mr/Mme] (French chanson)
[Candy] (an entire Halloween musical)
Just to name a few
Wow I had totaly forgotten about Envoi by Absinthe Minded
Thanks for bringing that now nostalgic song back to me
I hate to admit I've never heard of any of these but I'm looking them up right now
Check out Your Highness if you like Stoner (metal)
Oh great
Yeah, I know the drummer a bit (he's my tattoo artist) and they have their own beer (brewed by the guitarist) as well
They're awesome guys
But looks like you know a lot about it then if you even came to Desertfest :)
Antwerp and Ghent
It's like cats and dogs
I lived in Ghent for two years as someone from Antwerp and I was looked upon
I know it happens the other way around as well
The province of Antwerp vs the province of West-Flanders
Most West Flemish people can't stand people from Antwerp and vice versa
I personally have no problem with either
Not sure about the fiercest, but I know the citizens of Aalst and Dendermonde
While they're more frenemies than enemies, it's been going on for 800 years
Aalst is mainly known for its onions and annual carnival, in which it isn't shy from controversies
Dendermonde is mainly known for its decennial "Ros Beiaard" parade, in which a giant horse puppet is paraded through the city with four "heemskinderen" (four brothers born consecutively and city natives) on its back
2020 would have hosted a parade, but it got cancelled due to COVID-19
At least every few years, the rivalry gets the news
There's a whole chronicle detailing the rivalry here (in Dutch, but Google Translate will help, if you're interested): [
Some highlights: both cities have produced a whole load of songs mocking the other one
Aalst has its own parody version of the Ros Beiaard, which is often used during their carnaval
One city stealing the other's horse, the other city listing one's horse on eBay, students of both cities occupying each other's monuments, city representatives getting desinfected at visits in the other city (pre-COVID, people
), ... Whatever you name, it has probably happened
Last year most recently, a truckload full of onions was dumped on a Dendermonde roundabout in the middle of the night
By now, the rivalry is rooted in tradition to such an extent that the cities have made joint statements to honour the tradition and keep it alive as much as possible
Man, I love being European at moments like this
I think Ghent vs Bruges is fiercer and dates back far longer
I honestly get the impression a lot of people talk shit about Antwerp but Antwerp doesn't really care
It's like when Samuel L Jackson was in Be for some movie and he posted a picture of de Grote Markt in Antwerp
Everybody on Instagram or whatever was shouting he had to come to Ghent, because it's nicer
If it were the other way around, nobody from Antwerp would've said anything, pretty sure about that
I live in Antwerp, originally from the area between Brussels and Leuven, and whenever someone says Antwerp = arrogant I just have to mention people from Ghent aren't any better tbh
Feels more like Ghent against Antwerp
Antwerp doesn't really care about Ghent
I'd say Dendermonde vs
Aalst is much fiercer rivalry
I would generalize this to Antwerp against the rest of Flanders (exept Limburg, I mean seriously do people still believe the lies that it exists
Antwerp is the city, the rest is parking commes to mind here
And here I am
Half Kempenaar & half West Vlaming
De avatar van Vlaanderen
Hate us cuz they aint us
I understand, I was very happy living in Ghent
Living in Antwerp wasn't the same afterwards, but I stayed for love
Same thing has happened with Anderlecht
And here I was, trying to defend you guys :p
Like you said, Antwerp doesn't care
I've lived my whole life in Antwerp and this is the first I heard of a rivalry between us and Ghent
Sure I've heard about other cities disliking us, but I never cared enough about that
I like parking jokes too much
I don't know what their reasons are for disliking Antwerp
Maybe it's because outside of Brussels (capital region, not the city itself) Antwerp is probably the only real "big city" we have in this small country
I don't know
But it's something that starts to annoy me sometimes
Whenever I say I live in Antwerp, everyone immediately has to yell "aaantwaarpe" or "tstad" or whatever they think is funny in a very bad impression of Antwerps, ignoring the fact that first I live here and I'm not from here and second: no one cares
>I don't know what their reasons are for disliking Antwerp
Maybe it's because outside of Brussels (capital region, not the city itself) Antwerp is probably the only real "big city" we have in this small country
I don't know
I think it's because of the Antwerp mentality
The big mouth, small heart
We come across as arrogant because we don't give a fuck about what others think and we have no problem saying that
That doesn't mean we think less of others, but we think primarily about ourselves first
>But it's something that starts to annoy me sometimes
Whenever I say I live in Antwerp, everyone immediately has to yell "aaantwaarpe" or "tstad" or whatever they think is funny in a very bad impression of Antwerps, ignoring the fact that first I live here and I'm not from here and second: no one cares
Ye, if it's done in a funny way I can appreciate it
But sometimes it's just people doing it because they can, but I guess that's also Antwerp
Every city has those, no need to feel ashamed of them
>I live here and I'm not from here
Everyone can become an Antwerpenaar
For plenty animation movies in Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, we use a Flemish dub rather than the Dutch dub yeah
Don’t want cheesy Dutch accents indoctrinated in our 7 year olds
Some animated movies even have complete separate dubbed versions: one in Flemish Dutch and one in Dutch Dutch
I really dislike the delivery of the Latin lines
Obviously none of the actors is native in the language and it just sounds like they're mindlessly saying the lines they studied
EDIT: I want to clarify I don't dislike the Latin from an objective standpoint, as far as I can tell there are no mistakes in grammar or vocabulary, I just believe they don't speak their lines like an actor would in English/any other language, there is almost no stress or intonation in the words
I'm also watching that with my parents, it's really nice to see how the German would be translated into our dutch oftentimes you can translate it directly and it sounds less fluid and older but still very understandable
It's a nice way to see that
I can't imagine how Latin might sound to you, it's made to be spoken the Italian way so it sounds different than how I might pronounce it, I personally quite like that they didn't have the Latin pronounced from an English standpoint or anything (my mother teaches Latin and she's absolutely taken)
With pleasure
Idk though, it's been heavily researched and it seemed pretty good to me, my mother teaches Latin and she loves it
Maybe you're confused because you're used to it being delivered with your accent (not an attack just wondering)
Right now I believe it sounds weird to me because most of the works I translated were written in dactylic hexameter, which obviously influences the stress in words and stuff
I think that's a really interesting point, I've started watching it with my family particularly because of the languages and since the Latin I'd a lot further away then German is to our Dutch I never really saw it that way
I'd agree though if the languages we're reversed it'd possibly feel very off to me
Dialects are basically dead in Wallonia, everybody uses the same grammar, and writes the words the same way (a dialect is : different grammar and different spelling /orthograph)
We have different accents though, but an accent isn't a dialect
In this regard we are very much the same as the Netherlands
Every town has its own dialect
But sadly enough most smaller dialect are going extinct with only older generations still speaking them
The bigger dialects from large cities are still spoken by most people though
In Belgium even more trust me
I recognise difference in dialects 10km away
It's the same here (in Flanders at least)
And I swear it's really hard or impossible for people from West Flanders to understand people from Limburg
Behalve west-vlaanderen
I'm 17 and I still speak my dialect at home and man it's so much more fun to talk in dialect then in Standard Dutch or even just *tussentaal*.
Here is West-Flanders the dialect is still going strong, though it's slowly fading away
Which is a shame honestly
An accent isn't a dialect though, an accent doesn't change grammar and doesn't change how words are written
You'd be surprised how accurate that is
Limburgish was a different language historically
It didn't evolve from Dutch, it evolved independently
That might be part of the reason
I have a Brabantian dialect from the province of Antwerp and I can understand all Flemish dialects but that may be partly because the modern language is mostly based on Brabantian dialects
It is sad indeed, I have heard some West-Flemish in various videos on Youtube, and I find it rather nice, I prefer it to "normal" Dutch
But at least it is still spoken, Walloon dialects are nearly extinct at this point
Some old people can still speak and still do, some schools exist to teach it, but it isn't widespread, ressources are neither easy to find nor plentiful
So, while some actions have been launched to save it, I don't think it is very successful, and there are few incentives to learn it
I speak a mix of Brabantian and East Flemish dialect and I can ussually understand what West Flemish or Limburgish people are talking about, but I can't understand every single word
Ussually yes, although I know someone who can't inderstand them so he talks English to them which can lead to very awkward moments
I speak Vlaams
Giesbaargs, a mix of East-Flemish and Brabantian
A different accent alone doesn't make a dialect
If you speak the standard/official version of your language but just have a different accent than the TV and radio version of your language, you don't speak another dialect
A dialect is nearly another language : it has a different way to write words, it had a sometimes different grammmar
Yeah sure you miss a word here and there but to me it's pretty understandable still
I certainly don't deny that an accent is an integral part of a dialect, just saying that a different accent alone isn't enough to say "it's another dialect". For example, in Belgium, people in Liège, Charleroi and Namur might all have a different accent than mine, but i don't consider their accent to form another dialect
And while Belgian French might have some slight differences with French French, the differences are too few and not strong enough to say Belgian French is a full dialect
It is a variety of French, rather than a dialect ; people from France and Belgium can understand each others without any problem, and sometimes without realising the person ins't French or isn't Belgian, despite the possible different accents
Well, thank you for the nuance you brought, I shall precise in the future than in my country, a different accent isn't considered a dialect, but that this is how we see things locally
I bookmarked the video for later
Well, thank you for bringing the position of linguists on the matter
In the language I speak, we don't consider the different accents to be dialects, even if for linguistics they might be
It just doesn't really fit how we view what a different dialect is
For example, it isn't like West-Flemish vs standards Dutch, which are written differently and have a somehow different grammar, or High-German/standards German vs Austrian German
We might have different accents, sometimes a slightly different vocabulary, but the differences are too small compared to what you have with German or the various Norwegian dialects
But of course, this isn't in accordance with the linguistics' definition
Somehow the blame for most things the EU fucks up ends up in Brussels, even tho politically speaking, Belgium only wields minor power within the EU
We don't plan this shit, we just allow them to plan it here
Edit: I know that it's just an English referencing structure
But that doesn't make it okay, because it makes less intelligent people take it literally nonetheless
I'm pretty sure Trump didn't mean the EU when he called Brussels a hellhole, but I have a pretty good guess where he got the idea
We don't get blamed, but they got the fame
French fries are not French, they are Belgian
Gosh, I hate it so much when they say "Brussels this, Brussels that
blahblah" as if we did enforce some shit on them
Especially the Brits obviously
Ok fair point let me edit that
I can assure you they know our beer and chocolat exists
Remembering our fries can't be that hard
Yes, yes it does make me feel good :)
Poor Walloons though
From what other people commented it seems that the fries were invented in France, but it were the Belgians that turned it into the fries we eat today
My whole life is a lie
Does Belgium even exist
How can I know anything anyone ever told me is real now
Yes, thank you
I have only recieved this article from the University of Liege maybe 10 times today
Boooi French fries are everywhere over here
Ever heared of a 'frituur'? It's sort of a fast-food restaurant where the fries are the most important part of what you order
NASA didn't invent the rocket yet they get all the fame for getting people on the moon
Also just not true
Having some vague link to another ethnicity doesn't suddenly make you non-Russian when you're born in Russia and your mother tongue is Russian
Stalin was Georgian though
It's the classic and fantastic technique of "Divide et impera", "divide and conquer". The Romans used it as well
You don't actually expect Americans to know the difference between the Arabic and Greek alphabet
Some of them propably think Greeks still build shrines to Zeus
Will admit: I ALMOST made that mistake between the 2 alphabets as well one time
Almost
Yes, that's my point: there is a huge difference
But there are people that haven't seen anything but their own alphabet for most of their early life so when they see 2 'foreign' alphabets they assume both are the same thing
Or don't bother to care about the difference
If the Brexit had been a well thought-trough plan with a whole explanation of 'this is why leaving is a good idea and that is what we will do IF you vote yes' and that plan made sense than I would have had no problem with leave-voters
But that's not what happend
The Brittish government was litterally like 'hey look we don't really have a plan or anything but we just wondered if you chaps would like to take a wild leap and leave the EU
We don't know how or what we're gonna do afterwards, but sometimes a man just has to do something crazy amIright
' AND PEOPLE IN THE UK ACTUALLY WENT WITH IT
And look in what sort of a mess we are now: The EU and UK are litterally at each others troat because nobody in the Brittish parliament knew what to do if the leave-voters actually won so they just decided to be a bitch to the EU
It's part of biology class in 8th grade but during that grade we cover both animals(7th was plants), their skeleton(think where the wrist is in the leg of a horse or where the legs in whales are), evolution and more importantly, all the "systems" in the body
Including the digestion system
(also the reproductive system so this is actually also sex ed basically)
So what happens if we combine those
We cut open a big flemish rabbit of course
(if you don't know that rabbit look it up, it's as big as a rather large dog)
So yea, during biology class after going over the digestion system in humans we cut open a rabbit in class
Blew with a straw into it's lungs, cut open the diaphragm and see what happens, disembowel it, etc
Damn that shit smells
We do have art history in Belgium in some departments
Between 3rd and 6th grade we tend to have all sort of "world orientation" subjects
Often combined with a trip
Instruments in the orchestra
Firefighters
Water
Butterflies
etc
etc
Art, normal life of ancient Greece and Roman people, etc
was also touched upon and we covered a lot of art in history classes later on
As the other guy said, Belgium by 11th grade has 100's of directions but I'm not going to count those because those aren't "normal" in most cases
Like I did software and IT in 11th grade so I had 5 hours of programming, 5 hours of computer hardware, 1 hour of math involving irrational numbers, etc
In Flanders, this is not a separate course, but part of the general Dutch classes
Apparently this is not the case in the Netherlands, poor souls
I mean, maybe it's not because of those lessons(though they're not a separate subject) but I'm pretty good in sniffing out bullshit or knowing when something is historical or fictional because of it
If those are related they should be fucking mandatory world wide, maybe we wouldn't have presidents not recognizing fucking satire
About 8000 French students and 40 000 German students learn Dutch, mostly in Hauts-de-France, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia
It is also taught in Brazilian highschools that are close to Suriname
The sad part is that it isn't even mandatory in Wallonia
That's how much they care about our language :(
We have it in catholic schools
It's honestly a fun class (if you don't have a teacher that just let's you learn useless stuff)
For me, it was basically a mix between history and ethics class
We just talked about how to be a good human and learned about the history of every religion and the differences between them
I don't get why so many people are against these classes
I would say that I spended a couple of hours on it each trimester back in (Flemish) highschool
Yes
8 fucking years of French for every Flemish student, starting in 5th grade
I studied science-mathematics (one of the least language focused studies) and I still had 3 hours of French per week, while only having 2 hours of English
In 7th grade I studied modern sciences and had 6(!) hours of French
If the school system was good enough so everyone would be fluent in French, I wouldn't mind
But of course that's not the case
It's bullshit
And when you then learn that Dutch isn't even mandatory in Wallonia, it's frustrating and completely understandible why so many Flemish people want to separate
Imo it's the basic form of respect to at least make it mandatory to learn the *majority language* (by far) of the country your living in
And then some Walloons still get mad when we don't (or just refuse to) speak French to them
Imagine if the Frisians didn't learn Dutch, I'm sure they would be hated too by a lot of Dutch people
It is
Zeg dat het minder energie kost om insecten te kweken omdat een populatie insecten heel snel biomassa opbouwt
Vergelijk het dan met hoe lang de draagtijd van landbouwdieren duurt
Zeg dat dit logisch is want grote dieren verspillen veel energie aan homeostase
Kippenvlees is ook duurzamer dan koeienvlees
Begin vervolgens over gekweekte vis: alle populaire vissen zijn carnivoor
Je moet eerst herbivore zeedieren kweken, die dan slachten en vermalen tot vismeel: dat dient dan als voer voor de carnivore vissen
Enorme energie- en waterkost
Veel beter zou zijn om insecten te kweken en die te voeren aan de vissen
Begin ook over alle voedselverspilling en zeg dat insecten dat kunnen opeten
Het Belgische bedrijf Millibeter gebruikt hiervoor de zwarte wapenvlieg en krijgt vervallen voedsel van de supermarkt
Lol, in Belgium we litteraly share a village with The Netherlands
There are random zones in this town which are part of Belgium and random zones part of The Netherlands
There litteraly is a store right now which half of it is closed during lockdown because it is in belgium and the other half of the store is open because it is in NL
Shop divided in 2: [
Since Baarle and Putte are already taken, I'm going with **Monschau
** Not a Belgian city, a German city, but the Belgian border runs through its borders - twice
To get from **Monschau, Germany** to **Mützenich, Germany,** one needs to cross through 40 meters of Belgian territory
That'd be two border controls, if people would be silly
The thin slice of Belgium, as seen clearly on the map below, is an old railway line given to Belgium as part of the Treaty of Versailles
Nowadays, it's part of a cycle network
Yes
The Benelux (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxemburg) has had a tariff union since 1944 and a full on economic union since 1958
The European Union was inspired by the Benelux Union multiple times
Serious explanation: during the late 12th century some Duke gave away lands to some other Lord
Fast forward 800 years later and one lord's lands were part of Belgium while the other pieces of land were part of the Netherlands
It's never been a problem so there's never been a reason to try and untangle the cluster fuck
Another possible answer: Why not
Definitely
Well, Germans seem to see their aggression and attack of Belgium and France in WW1 as some sort of legitimate act of "defense".
Meanwhile, we see it as a barbaric and unjustified action, as the actual starting of WW1
They not only illegaly and unlegitimately invaded a neutral country, they as well : killed thousands of innocent civilians, pillaged Wallonia and destroyed its industries, imposed a reign of terror on Walloons
And if it wasn't enough, they tried to sabotage the country as a whole, by exporting their vision of nationalism to the Flemings, and revisioning/simplifying history by making them believe that Walloons were the ones forcing French upon them (while in reality, it was the bourgeoisie and nobility, Flemish included, that oppressed both Dutch-speaking Flemings and Walloon-speaking Walloons)
This act of sabotage is known as Flamenpolitik
Ironically, Germans were less barbaric and savage in Belgium during WW2
But while they apologise for WW2, they seem to think they did nothing wrong in WW1
The fact that Dutchies don’t believe that without Flanders they would have never become the Naval power they used to be
during the 16th century Flanders was one of the wealthiest regions in Europe, because we were the biggest trade region north of Italy
At the time of the Spanish war The Netherlands were absolutely nowhere near the power/ wealth Flanders had
Because of this war many Flemish merchants fled to cities as Amsterdam
When they fled they also brought their wealth and knowledge
After some time they started doing business as back home and the rest is history
He's remembered as both a warmonger and a reformer by a lot of people
He's viewed negative and positive here
Negative because obviously he conquered us and positive because he brought a lot of reforms like everyone having last names and just the laws
That's like a French person saying they deserved to win the last world cup football
(I hope I don't start a war here lol)
Well basically our whole country supported Croatia
Yup and imo they deserved to win
I was surprised at how much Danish, Swedish and Norwegian I could understand if I focused enough on the text
I also noticed that the longer, more complicated words were often similar to Dutch (högreståndspersoner  - personen van een hogere stand) whereas short, simple words were completely different
Are scandinavic language german
I speak Dutch as a mother tongue and I'm pretty fluent in English so I understand everything of those languages
So:
Afrikaans: basically 100%
Low German: 50-60%
Luxembourgish: 40-50%
German: 30-40%
Bavarian: maybe like 10-20% at most
Danish, Swedish and Norwegian: almost nothing except a word here and there
Icelandic: nothing
For some reason I can understand a lot of German if it's spoken, but if it's written it's very hard to understand words
Yeah
Flemish isn't even a language
It's a collection of Dutch dialects and Germanic languages that are politically called Flemish
As a french belgian, when I read dutch it's flemish (I barely understand spoken dutch)
No, this is more something from the generation of my grand-parents
Well, the [second version of our anthem] was quite hostile toward the Dutch crown/royal family
Considering how the Dutchies seem to like them, since they even decided to take their name as national colour, they would probably find it offensive
> Les lacs du Connemara
What's even funnier, is that this song is a staple at weddings over here, or at least in Flanders
Do you wave your napkins around to this song or is that just us
We have this classic from the early 2000s. I had not heard the [original] yet
Al wie da ni springt
Al wie da ni springt
Al wie da ni springt is homofiel
>Everyone who doesn't jump is homosexual (though countless variations have been around)
Song for children were usually quite odd
This was a song for dividing children up in two groups
Two children take eachother by the hands and form a gate where the rest of the group has to go through while singing:
>White swans
>Black swans
>Who wants to sail with us to England
>England is closed
>The key is broken
>Is there no smith in the country
>Who can fix the key
>Let go through, let go through
>Who stays behind has to lead(?)
At the end, the two put there arms down, capturing whoever was going through it
That child then has to choose between a golden apple or a silver pear
They wisper the answer and that decision decides behind which of the 2 children they have to stand
Children songs are weird is all I'm saying
Student militias
What
What is the oignon's song
Never heard of it
And when played, it's tradition that the guests will wave their napkins around
Can confirm, am flemish and knew this
I didn't want to make it sound more ridiculous than it already is tbh
I tend to gravitate towards England and the Ottomans in most Paradox games
Rarely my own origins
My favourites in EU4 are Burgundy, Muscovy and one of the powers in Northern-China like the Yurchen tribes or Mongolia or a successor
Japan is also nice for playing in Asia
I only played ckII once and I played as Sweden it was fun but I never touch the game since !
But in EUIV I usually love to play as Poland or France, both of them have rival that are kinda challenging to take down and they both have interesting mission tree !
Imperator Rome: Menapia
Crusader Kings 2: The duchy of Flanders
Europa Universalis IV: Flanders
Victoria 2: Belgium
Hearts of Iron 4: Belgium
I play Belgium because it is a minor nation, wich is more challenging and fun IMO, and because i'm Flemish, seeing my country endure gives me a patriotic pride
I also play a lot of Sweden and Romania, but major powers like Engeland or Germany/HRE are a bit overwhelming for me
In eu4 Austria, lowlands or German duchies
In Victoria II Prussia or Belgium
I usually tend to play with the German (Age of Empire) for the cavalry and big industry
Then again I'm from a Pseudo-Germanic side of Belgium
Usually not as fleshed out as the more prominent nations
Sure, me too, but despite these origins we have more in common with our other neighbors
I would be quite scared if they made a Belgian Faction in Age of Empire (colony are not something we should have any more) but a game set in the antiquity could be quite cool (Maybe Total War Troy if they make DLC faction up north)
Yeah, I guess that's part of being Belgian
I do kind of identify with the Netherlands and have enjoyed playing as the Netherlands in EU4, but I do also identify with France (and I enjoy playing France too)
Can't be bothered to play as Vlaanderen though, that too much of a challenge
Burgundy in EU4 is pretty good to play
You'll like it since it's largely about trade, colonialism and development
You just have to fight past the difficult beginning and take care of France
Repaying the loans needed for that is enough incentive to play the trade game
The 'record' is shared by different small villages, all situated in Wallonia
The names are Nil-Saint-Vincent-Saint-Martin, Malèves-Sainte-Marie-Wastines, Geest-Gérompont-Petit-Rosière and Chaussé-Notre-Dame-Louvignies (26 letters)
If your talking about cities then Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve (23 letters) has the longest name
Belgium has Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, 26 characters
I'm planning on maybe visiting Utrecht for a weekend
Heard it was pretty nice there and it's not too far away
Amsterdam
I've somehow never been there
I know Dutch people often say it's overrated but I don't care
I've only ever been to Zeeland in the Netherlands
When I visit Amsterdam, I'll probably also visit the Waddeneilanden and maybe Friesland
Not this year since I bought an appartment a year ago and I'm still rebuilding my financial reserves, but the next trip I plan, is to visit Moscow or St
Petersburg
Because Russian architecture is really beautiful and it has been on my wishlist since I was a kid
Especially Moscow
Always been fascinated by Russia
Also, the very tip of Scandinavia
Because I want to see the polar night
It must be so weird
There was this wonderful reddit thread I checked before I did my Erasmus there, I’ll see if I can find it
(PM me if I havent linked it by tonight haha)
I terms of smaller cities in Belgium I would definitely recommend Leuven
Only about 100 000 inhabitants but it houses a huge university so very vibrant with plenty of things to do
For Belgium, I would recommend : Dinant and Durbuy for picturesque value
For historical value : Tournai : ancient capital of the Franks, under Childeric and Clovis
I've been there twice before
Overrated, sure, but definitely worth the visit
It has a lot of nice stuff but it's just crowded with annoying tourists who are only there for weed and hookers
Isn't Brno the place with the race track
So you're saying I can go to the Netherlands without having to miss a trusty old Belgian café? Now I'm definitely sold
Leuven is a big city though, 100 000 inhabitants is big
Yeah well size is relative and looking at the average city in France (and Europe in general) I'd consider Leuven small, but I get it
How about Ypres then
Or Durbuy for the smallest of small
It is relative indeed
I must admit that I'm biased by my Belgian perspective of what is a big city, and even more so from the Walloon Brabant perspective, where the "biggest" city has "only" 40 000 inhabitants
Yeah we don't have many "big" cities in Belgium
Looking at it in a broader perspective, I think only Brussels and Antwerp would qualify as such
Ghent, Charleroi and Liège are arguable, but everything beneath that I'd say could be considered "small" by modern standards
Knokke for sure
They ride golf carts through center of town as if it was a normal means of transportation
Some of them also pretend to have French accents just to sound fancier and their mayor was for years on end (42 years to be exact) the local Count who was a product of incest and who openly hated on the lower classes (died this year)
That's how old money Europe it gets right there
On top of that it's not even a beautiful city or anything
Vienna immediately comes to mind as a place for rich people
Is Zürich worse
I have never been there
Also so much fur coats over there, it's unsettling
A one way tram ticket is nearly 7CHF if my memory serves, so yeah I think we can say Zurich is one step above (but I agree with you about Vienna looking rich, especially the touristy places)
Yeah I don't think anyone understands the whole golf cart thing they got going on there
But obviously there's also plenty of Porsches and fat BMW's going around to make sure you don't forget their cash cash money
EDIT: [just as a little example of the counterbalance]
Yeah I have no clue why anyone would like to live there haha
It's terribly ugly and terribly expensive
All those ugly apartments in the back literally cost millions
Truly mindboggling
And for Belgians, the UK and France feel like Eastern Europe
I think Russia lol
I have never seen any more foreign one,  although I do not really pay attention to license plates
Saw an Estonian plate in my street in a small town where not many foreigners live
Very surprised  as I rarely seen any non-Belgian plates in my area
When I was in Cannes, France there was a whole street full of super expensive cars with license plates from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE
Yesterday we passed a truck with a Kazakhstan license place on the highway
There's Kazakh, Moldavian and Armenian Cars parked in my street in Brussels center
I see a lot of American plates around Tervuren
I've seen a Texan drive around here in Belgium once
Didn't really need a license plate to tell me that, because his vehicle was HUGE, but it did confirm it
While at the north rim of Grand Canyon, I spotted a small VW bus with Belgian number plates
It turned out to be a couple of travellers from less than 5 km from where I live(d) in Belgium
It felt a bit weird to speak Flemish (again) overlooking the Grand Canyon in the rain
The weather made it feel very "belgian".
Weird license plate
To be exact, it's the tail that is little, not the monkey
Not to be confused with "aapjestaart" which would be little monkeys pie
Most Belgians cheer for anyone who's playing against France
If both Belgium and the Netherlands are playing, we better bloody well win from those Dutchies
But once we're out of the game and the Netherlands are still in, we root for them
You go, you lovely orange cheeseheads
Yes I would support The Netherlands
We love to tease each other but at the end of the day we do share a language that bonds is
I'd never cheer for France or The Netherlands
Maybe for Spain or England though
I'll cheer for netherlands if belgium is knocked out as long as they don't win
When Belgium is out me and my friends generally cheer for any country against France ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'll cheer for Spain as half of my family comes from there
Sometimes I'll cheer for Germany or the Netherlands but never ever for France
Not France
Same
And we cheer for you too
^Unless ^Luxembourg ^is ^playing
Has been the case for as long as I can remember haha
I would never root for them
you forgot a few:
5- happy
6- cake
7- day
Broo
Everybody hate the French
To each their own I guess
We can still hope
Living in the Netherlands I found that people will talk far more directly to you than they would in Belgium
I considered a few remarks I got just to be rude and as if people were invading my privacy
Netherlands and UK: How small their houses are on average
Same here, I knew a Canadian exchange student years ago and I took him to a Belgian techno club once and the next day he literally told me 'I don't understand European nightlife' hahahaha
I can add a +1 on the bureaucracy in France
It was equally bad in Bordeaux
Go to the pub around 9pm
Have some drinks
Have some laughs
Arrive at party around midnight
Hmm, I don't remember unfortunately
If it has town rights, it's a town
It is funny, I always wondered why they've done that and how this countries can function
I've only been to two (Monaco and Luxemburg, if you count Luxemburg in it because apparently a microstate is a 'country' with less than 400k inhabitants and Luxemburg has more so idk)
I'm Belgian
We are probably the smallest non-micro state in Europe
I don't have any opinion about people in microstates, I don't think a lot about microstates and I think they are a relict of ancient times in which there were a lot of city states
Honestly, some of those microstates were kept alive after the First and Second World War because large European nations thought "oh, so cute that you're still alive
Well, you're a cute puppy and you attract tourists, so you can stay alive". Monaco is a shame within Europe, tax heaven for the rich
Belgians should invade it, just to make a point
Luxembourg is our neighbour, we Belgians and Dutch use it for cheap gas on the way to our vacation in France
And no, this is not a joke
On the other hand, it's fantastic when they beat or draw a big country
Never forget Turkey - San Marino 0-0
I think it was a stupid idea
Things are going to escalate now
Not so very epic future maybe
I'm more worried about the fact that Trump ordered someone to drop bombs on a civilian airport
I'm glad I'm not a young and healthy American male
I just hope we're gonna stay out of this as much as possible
We have no business in picking a fight with Iran
Also, just as re-election year comes up, Trump does this ""heroic"" thing and his supporters will eat it right up, like it happened with Bush
Sadly,  US voters will react to this, by giving Trump an even bigger majority
US media will stand behind their president if this escalates
I dont give a shit if the US thinks we're cowards for not joining their potential war
Fuck them in the ear
Germany, again
Probably the Dutch
They still haven't fully progressed that we became independent about 190 years ago
Luxembourg
You don’t have debt if you kill the bankers
#Thinkaboutit
Since when is Scotland an independent country
A nation must be independent to be called a country, this is neither the case of Scotland or England
Neither do we, so yeah
You want ligma sauce with it
Are you implying that Germany will invade Russia ?
Wait what does it look like
Yeah clearly the US is very willing to impeach their presidents for commiting war crimes, just look at what happened to Bush and Obama for having torture camps
[here] [here] and [here] are some sources that take about 3 seconds to look up
I'm sure you can find about a billion more if you want to look for them
Guantanamo bay doesn't ring a bell
The articles I linked all talk about how torture is still being used there despite being illegal under both international and US law
Even if it isn't being used anymore that doesn't excuse the use of it in the recent past
The point still stands that the US isn't held accountable for commiting war crimes
Not by it's own people or institutions, and because of the threat of war, not by international organisations
They were under Bush and under Obama, and several sources claim that they still use torture there, even if they claim not to
We can leave those speculations for what they are as long as there is no evidence to prove them, but given the US's stance odds of an unbiased investigation is pretty low
Either way, the point still stands that under the Bush administration Guantanamo bay was turned into a torture camp, which is a war crime, and under the very same administration the policy was ratified to invade any country hosting an international court that would put on trial an American for war crimes
Most people in what
Guantanamo bay
Most people in it are put in it with no trial or investigation
Even if we live in the assumption that every person in imprissoned in Guantanamo bay is 100% certain a war criminal, that doesn't give the US free reign to torture them
Commiting war crimes against war criminals still is a war crime
This isn't hard
Oh great, whataboutism, such a great argument
Are you claiming that other countries do nothing to combat terrorism and that the USA is somehow this sole beacon of justice in a war against evil
Cause if that's your argument I'm gonna suggest you check yourself into a mental clinic of some sort, cause you're fucking crazy
Obviously terrorism is bad, nobody is saying that it isn't, but if you can't see that torturing people and then threatening to invade your own allies if they hold any of your people accountable for their crimes is a bad thing, then you really are blind
like locking away people without a trial or investigation, torturing them, threatening war on your own allies if they hold you accountable for your war crimes and claiming the moral high ground while doing all that
Great things you're doing there
You must feel very proud
We have "social restaurants" where you can get a meal for cheap
Cheapest I know of is €5 for soup, main course, dessert and coffee
What great/catchy songs will never be famous worldwide since it's written in your native language
This one's from Belgium, the Flemish part to be precise
It's a very famous song here, a classic if you will
People from the uk : sad English noises
Everything from Fleddy Melculy
[L'Enfer des Dieux] by Mass Hysteria is quite catchy
Mia by gorki is beautiful, and I think it's pretty well Known in the flemish part of Belgium
First two are known here too c:
That song is indeed beautiful
I love old music like that
Geweldig liedje bij het feesten hahah
Schlager
Yees this one
Honestly this reminds me of Lorenzo's "Fume à Fond". It's a French rap song about smoking weed
Quite catchy as well imo
What about the wonderful [Moonspell] ?
Bijelo Dugme is awesome
Very qualitative rock
Thought you were gonna post something like "de kreuners -ik wil je"
I've never heard the one you posted before
I'm not that into Flemish music but I have to say this one is better than a lot of the things I hear in flanders
"Ik moet zuipen" stays on the top of my "best ducht songs"-list tho
Die had ik nog niet gehoord maar klinkt goed
And nobody heard it in Francophone Belgium, where music in Dutch isn't played on radio
Flemish songs, is sang in Dutch, aren't even famous in all the country
I did not know of this song
I would've thought something made by Clouseau, K3 of Niels Destadsbader (skwon meiske is catchy imo )
Or happy Welsh or Scottish-Gaelic noises
"Het is een nacht" is de grootste schijf ooit
What about "Ik Moet Zuipen" van Schorre Chef
Kaizers Orchestra is amazing
Personally i like Glittertind's songs too
Norwegian is a gorgeous language
Everyone singing in English would be kind of boring though
Italy "fixed" this in 2018 by having the lyrics on-screen in tons of languages
Since they got 5th then, it seemed appreciated
Hahaha can't argue with that, that's a true must on the party playlist
Oh sorry, maybe this link will work
If not, the song is called "Als ze lacht" by Yevgueni
België!
Is er leven op Pluto
As you can see I'm not good at electronics, the first link should work though
Kun je dansen op de maan
In the Flemish version he had a West-Flemish Accent
I found it pretty fitting
Ge zit nen tovenoare, Harry
Echt
In de filmversie
Nog eens dringend herbekijken dan hahah
De mop is dat ik weet waar die link naartoe gaat zonder er zelfs op te klikken
Edit: ik had gelijk
More accurately, "brief" is a letter/postal and "briefje" just means it's a small one
And "spieken" bassically means cheating/copying (on a test)
In Belgium (french-speaking part) we say "un copion", from the verb "copier", to copy
The whole point of a cheat note is that you are not allowed to use it
;-)
No, though in some schools there are a few lockers available for a small rent
Yes but only a few use them and there are only 40 lockers in total
Well, we need to bring our books in school bags every day to school
However, my school has small lochers but you need to be quick because there are only like 150 for 450 students
Luckily if you rent one (pretty cheap), you can keep it untill you leave the school so you don't need to try to get one every year
Most students just put their bag with clothes for physical education class and their stuff for drawing class in it
And maybe a couple books but there isn't enough space for all of them
Yes ! They were quite tiny and you could rent them for a school year
I know my school had lockers but I know it's not the norm
During the first 4 years of high school, we had homerooms were the majority of our classes were thaught in (except classes that required specialized equipment, like sciences), so we just stashed most of our books in our desks
In my last two years we didn't have those anymore so every class was in a different room
They had lockers but not enough for all students and they came at a small fee
I never bothered with them but most of my peers seemed to like it
we all had our own locker in my school and the schools I know of
This doesn’t seem to be the case everywhere  though now that I read some of the comments
I went to 2 different high schools
They both had them but they were optional
It was more to leave your lunch and some personal stuff
Everyone carries their books in their backpacks
We also had to pay a fee but it was 5€ and you could get them back at the end of the year when you gave back your card
I don't think it's very common elsewhere to not be in their shoes all day tbh
The same in Dutch
10^3 = duizend
10^6 = miljoen
10^9 = miljard
10^12 = biljoen
10^15 = biljard
10^18 = triljoen
10^21 = triljard
Etc
I thin in french it’s the same with billion/trillion
This page disagrees
How would you say quadrillion
Tahutbiljoona (thousand biljoona)
That word doesn't seem to exist
I think our way of doing it is sensible
There is clear logical there
Most of the European mainland uses this system and I agree
We work in powers of a million
10^6 is a miljoen
(10^6 )^2 is a biljoen
(10^6 )^3 is a triljoen
Etc
The thousands inbetween have the same prefix but end with 'ard' instead
1000 * 10^6 = miljard = duizend miljoen
1000 * (10^6 )^2 = biljard = duizend miljoen
1000 * (10^6 )^3 = triljard = duizend triljoen
Etc
On the otherhand, english has stepped into a system of thousands which gives you:
10^3 = thousand
(10^3 )^2 = (10^3 )^(1+1) = million
(10^3 )^3= (10^3 )^(2+1) = billion
(10^3 )^4 = (10^3 )^(3+1) = trillion
(10^3 )^n is named after n-1 for n>1
This makes way less sense, on top of that thousend doesn't follow the same ruleset even though it is clearly a power of 1000
It would make more sense if they said
(10^3 ) = million
(10^3 )^2 = billion
(10^3 )^3 = trilion
They don't make as much sense as the long system, where numbers are more predictable
The numbers have prefixes indicating how many groups of six zeros there are
- Million = 1 000 000 ^1
- Billion = 1 000 000 ^2
- Trillion = 1 000 000 ^3
- Quadrillion = 1 000 000 ^4
So if you want to know the magnitude of a septillion, it's easier and more intuitive to figure it our in the long system than the short system
- Septillion= 1 000 000 ^7 = 10 ^(6 *7) = 10^42 = 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
The short system doesn't have these neat identities
That's not what I meant
How do you say 10^15 in Finnish
It's billiard in French, biljard in Dutch, quadrillion in English
Do you say tahutbiljooni in Finnish
Wow, didnt know that
Cool fact
That's not as straight forward at all
No wonder it isn't! This formula was retrofitted onto the short system, rather than defining it
That's also how you used to say it in British English
It's easy but vastly more complex
You can draw a continuous graph through any sequence of numbers
The long scale draws a simple graph, as it was designed to do so
The short scale doesn't.
Yes, we have old coal mines that sometimes sink buildings
I think it's about 60% Dutch, 40% French
I think the whole dividing in communes, regions and provinces by itself makes us stand out
You started the first one too by attacking Belgium and France
If you hadn't done it, it wouldn't have gone world war
Tbh Eastern Europe is catching up pretty fast and that time spent with communist regimes is probably the major cause for why Eastern Europe had such an economy
Are you sure that's not the UK
Has it been in continuous use in that time
(including for regional during occupation ofc)
That would break my heart
Yeah I know I was just saying the numbers, I wasn't saying you're wrong
Belgium was a neutral country, it couldn't let Germans go through
Germany had no valid/legitimate reason to attack
Germany could have decided not to enter the war
They had no valid/legitimate reason to attack
I know but you're talking about electronic music culture which is a lot bigger than edm
No, it’s not
If I exit through the back I look at the driver through his mirror and do the little nod thing to thank him
At one point I took a bus, Monday to Friday, for 2 years
I've never even so much as looked at him
Like, I wouldn't want random strangers talking to me in his situation
Over here in West Flanders it is, at least in smaller cities
Really
I’m from there too and honestly never heard anyone do that before
If it's a long one and you're in the back, it can't be helped
Funny because I hear it all the time
Well, let's do the math here :
* Europe + USA = 1,07 billion people
USA being only 327 million
* China alone = 1,4 billion people
Blizzard is a capitalist company, the choice is made for the shareholders and company owner/CEO : China = more potential profit
Don't expect ethics and morality from capitalism, there is none in it
People can die, suffer, starve, as long as corporations make profit
That the whole point of capitalist economy/ideology, just look at the millions starving every year, despite the fact there is actually much more food that we need to feed everybody
I just tried to send a request and they want to verify it's my account so they're asking for my ID
Now that's a dilemma
Faire enough, but living standards in China are rising, its middle class is growing
So, while just now it still doesn't have the same purchasing power, it might have in 10 or 20 years
In long terms, China is a big potential market
Besides, China quite likely produces most Blizzards goodies and electronics, so, I don't think they can afford to loose them
You're going to love the Baarle-Hertog/Baarle-Nassau border my friend
Cyprus and Czechia
We may not have the prettiest border, but I like the coincidence that we have a monarchy, and that [we have a little crown on top
Though ironically our King, compared to most other monarchies, is a popular monarch, meaning he is not a king of the land, but rather a king of the people
They should come together and form the Phallic union
A boot kicking a piece or rock
Imperialism at it's very worst
Any country that takes being in favour of democracy serious should severely condemn the invasion
Of course not a single EU nation will dare to do so
Make of that what you will
As we had ISIS-attacks in Belgium and the Kurds fought with the Alliance against the terrorists, our country should absolutely support them
Plus I see no reason, why Turkey should be helped
TBF, they weren't getting in the EU anytime soon ever since Erdogan got dictatorship fantasies
Okay, I respect your opinion but here's a fact
Kurdistan doesn't exist
We fought for these lands and still are fighting the PKK (a kurdish terror organization) and will not give up the lands just because they wanted independence
That's like Spain giving away Catalonia or Serbia giving Kosovo
I personally don't support Erdogan and the younger generation who will be voting in the next elections (which i am a part of) dont really like Erdogan and so naturally we wont be voting for him but still Kurds won't be getting independence with the new president unless the new president is a pro kurdish independence guy
(I do recognize the Armenian Genocide fyi)
It's the first real anarchist country, even with all the flaws
They were building a very good and healthy country, and trying to make all ethnicities feel welcome and heard
"Your land".
I do not condone terrorist actions by the PKK or any other groups, but you have to admit, considering what 'your blood' did for centuries, it rather pales in comparison
Armenians, Greeks and now Kurds who have been around in those areas for centuries as well
Just admit it, it's not that hard
What you said IS correct, we did not treat them with the respect they had deserved but what im trynna tell is that they wont be getting indepencence
If someone would deserve independence for being treated like shit then why are there no black republics in North America or Europe
Yes, there are a few things which give it away
Non-native accents are really hard to get rid of, up to the point where it’s sometimes even possible to hear what a speaker’s native language when they’re speaking English
Native speakers also tend to have a certain style and use less common words and expressions which tends to give it away
You can usually pick out the Dutch and French accents very easily
Yeah, for example, Dutch speakers seem to use the word 'also' a lot more compared to 'too' or 'as well', which is probably because 'also' is in the same position in the sentence as 'ook' in Dutch
Yes they all mean 'ook', but 'also' is in the same position in the sentence as 'ook' is in Dutch, while the other 2 aren't.
For dying, and indirectly related to biting, we have "casser sa pipe", to break one's pipe
But it's the reverse connection: if you're biting the pipe it means you're alive
When you die, you let go, the pipe falls to the ground and breaks
Here in Belgium we use it the same way
De houten mantel aantrekken is another one
Our politics
Nobody understands it any more, not even Belgians
In Belgium we fry our fries twice
This is apparently something other countries don't do
If you think you understand Belgian politics, whoever explained it to you explained it wrong
Why are there condoms in the baby box
The government wants to prevent you having more babies
I pay €29,99 for 15gb
Competition is dead here and the prices outrageous
Me neither
Over here I pay €29,99 for 15gb
It ridiculous
AnneMayKantereit is a phenomenal German band I don't even care that I don't understand jack shit of the lyrics
i would say it's [1 uit de 1000] if i were to guess which is most popular right now
Belgium: Brussels
Flanders: well, basically everyone picks on West-Flanders or Limburg, except if they are from that region, plus obviously French speakers
Walloons: no clue, I assume they just pick on Flanders or something
In Belgium probably the french-speaking part
For people from Flanders Walloonia is the odd one out, for Walloon people, Flanders us the odd one out
I would say our German speaking minority that live near the border
I guess it would be the Oostkantons
Everybody seems to forget they even exist
For Belgium it's the Germanspeaking Community
that's like half the country
East Cantons
No, definitely Flanders, the only part of Europe where voting for ancient collaborators and former Nazis is seen as normal and doesn't shock people
Yes there's that too, ofcourse
And still not having a government because of it
> Doesn't shock people
What newspapers have you been reading copain
You know I'm including the N-VA right
Apparently Flemish people consider the N-VA a normal party, despite its dubious origin, despite the fact Jan Jambon went to event in favor of ancient Flemish SS, despite the far-right links and idead of Theo Francken, despite the ancient nazi, and neo-nazi Bob Maes was made a member of the Antwerpen branch of the N-VA
I hate Maluma
Niels Destadsbader
Now you made me cry because I remembered that Kamping Kitsh is also canceled
So basically the liefde voor muziek songs
Is it really worse than Maître Gims or Jul though
Euh
It works
2 girls now having their own households, but only one had boyfriends stay overnight (as far as we know) when she still lived with us
A typical conversation then
"Oh mum, it's possible so-and-so will stay the night".
"OK, just protect yourself, clean up afterwards and don't make too much noise
Is he staying for breakfast ?"
Her bedroom was next to ours, and there have been occasions we could hear him snore
If you're bringing a crush over to spend the night, everyone kinda assumes you're having sexual intercourse anyway
It's not exactly discussed, unless you're ruining other people's sleep
I think it also helps that our houses are not made of plywood, but more often solid brick
So the sound isolation is generally pretty decent
Let's see
I could sleep at my gf's house or she could sleep with me since around 16
(never heard a no for these things but I didn't exactly ask it at 14)
My first girlfriend lost her virginity(and I mine) in her bed at home with her parents downstairs
Never had an issue with this in general
One of those problems I'm too European to understand I think
I can't imagine that my parents would frown upon bringing a girlfriend home for the night
They might not be happy at having a series of girls at breakfast, but I suppose as long as you are reasonably discrete, they wouldn't mind
For an internship I once lived some weeks with my (still quite catholic) grandparents
I know they made a fuss when my parents wanted to move in together before they were married
So I was quite nervous to ask whether my long term girlfriend could stay the night, and I was prepared for the demand that she would stay in another room
They were perfectly fine with it
Yep
Currently age 29 and my sister is 26
I hear my sister and her boyfriend
She will sometimes hear my gf
Leave the room for a while or set up a headset or something
I'll catch them fucking in the pool
They caught me and my gf on occasion
Sex happens, get over it
Brought girls home since I was 16, even got my own hotel room when she went with us on holiday
We had a lot of fun being able to be a tad louder that week
Damn, that was to the US
We broke a lot of laws over there, haha
No way we're not having champagne on New Years Eve
Never had to lock the door because frankly, if you suddenly enter my room and my gf is riding my dick it's your own damn fault
As I learned the hard way, lol
Caught my sister doing exactly that at one point when I went over to ask if she needed anything at the shop next door
Ow, and the noise thing, do note that my room was build out of concrete and brick basically, including the inner walls
If I want to hang something on the wall you better have a drill
A hammer won't do and noise is in general less of an issue
We're both more or less planning to move out next year
We worked for the family company so it was just easier to live at home and save money for when we do move out
I'm leaving home next year with around €210k.
"Could do safe experimenting in my own bed ;)"
This is what baffles me honestly
Why wouldn't you want your daughter to lose her virginity where she's most comfortable
Had sex for the first time at my gf's place at 16 while her parents were downstairs
Looking at it from the comfort and safety of the girl's point of view that just seems rather ideal
Would be nice if there were some people over here who know it out of their head
Since it contains the lyric "Oh flourish country, with a unity that can't be broken" and considering our current political climate, where there's a very obvious ideological split between the two regions, making the formation of a federal government impossible, I always found that line a bit ironic
No one knows it by heart back here
We have ‘De brabaçonne’ in Belgium but because we speak not only one language it really weird before a soccer match
In general I think the unofficial anthems are way better
Rule Britannia for example
My mother is Italian and my father a fan of Ferrari, we would always hum that song when Ferrari won a F1 circuit
Happy memories
O dierbaar België o heilig land der vaaderen
Onze ziel en ons hart zijn u gewijd
Aanvaard de kracht en het bloed van onze aderen
Wees ons doel in arbeid en in strijd
O land in eendracht niet te breken
Wees immer u zelf en ongeknecht,
Het woord getrouw dag ge onbevreesd moogt spreken
voor vorst, voor vrijheid en voor recht
Voor vorst, voor vrijheid en voor recht
Voor vorst, voor vrijheid en voor recht
Pa pa pa paa pa pa pa pa pa pa paaa papapa
Pa pa pa pa pa papapapa VOOR VORST, VOOR VRIJHEID EN VOOR RECHT
I never had to learn the text, probably never will, since I don't care
Don't like the anthem either tbh
Ô Belgique, ô mère chérie,
À toi nos cœurs, à toi nos bras
À toi notre sang, ô patrie,
Nous le jurons tous, tu vivras !
Tu vivras, toujours grande et belleee,
Et ton invincible unité,
Aura pour devise immortelleee,
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté
Aura pour devise immortelleee,
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté
Imo La Brabançonne is a beautiful anthem
I had to learn it at school 2 years ago and I still know and I love it
It's definitely on the beautiful side
Also, anthems are just as good as the community of the country standing behind it
Look at the Welsh anthem when performed in stadiums, goosebumps
Very good
Just in time haha
And thank you
According to one of our prime ministers it goes:
"Allons enfants de la Patrie
They just fought Netherlands and needed a king dude with a good network to guarantee neutrality
They had to make him want to stay I guess
Mostly Granny Smiths and Pink Ladies
I'd say around 5
1 or 2 green varieties, 1-2 cheap red varieties, pink lady & bio
Egg shells ... crack ... causer
Belgium as well
Did you know they also work amazing for slicing mushrooms
Protip: they're also really good at slicing mushrooms
Which kind
We generally use the metal one like [this
But I've heard tale of string based slicers being used in Scandinavian countries
My parents have had the same one since 1998
My in-laws get a new one every year though, always from Bond Zonder Naam
Went on exchange last semester and some people were absolutely baffled when I said I (and most other Belgians) owned a deepfryer at home lol
That's so weird,  i never thought about it that they might not have it
My family was one of the households without a fryer, and i also don't have one
(Too dangerous
That is what frituren are for,  no
Dutch has alot of them
Half our language consists of words that could be childspeak
Fridge
Koelkast (cold closet)
Glove
Handschoen (hand shoe)
Hippopotamus
Nijlpaard (Nile horse)
Turtle
Schildpad (shield frog)
(Edit) another iconic one is the word Sloth - Luiaard (Lazy being) and Hospital - Ziekenhuis (house of sick people)
Well, we call gloves "handschoenen", which translates to "hand shoes"
Same in Dutch although not used that often:  'schietgeweer' is 'shootgun'
Wait, you don't say GSM for smartphones and mobile phones
Well German also has some childish sounding words like 'Fahrrad' (idk if that's the wright spelling) which is a bycicle
Literally it means drive  wheel (I think)
> Luipaard (lazy horse)
It comes from leopard though, the fact that evolved to sound like "lazy horse" is pure coincidence
Ladybug
Pimpampoentje
Afrikaans is on another level
Kijkkassie (Watching box) aka Television
Even tho I heard that word isn’t being used anymore
Flemish here, we call it a ‘brommer’.
Well, German and Dutch are closely related
We also call a turtle a shield-toad (schildpad), but a bike is just a fiets
Well like I said it's not used often and I don't think it would get used by military people, but more just in 'de volksmond'
I prefer it over "mobieltje". This is a hill I'm willing to die on
Maybe that's only in the Netherlands but I've never heard of that word
Well
Yes
You're not alone
And whomst'd've
talk dirty to me, daddy
It looks a lot like a traditional student cantus (drinking and singing evening)
No clapping, knock on the table instead
Make a V sign with your hands if you wish to speak, a T sign to ask for a time out to go to the bathroom
If the "speaker" says surgite, all must rise, sedimus =sit down
The rules and customs are archaic, sometimes dumb and pointless, but usually necessary so a bunch of drunk students are able to sing the same song at the same time without too much loss of time
It's not unsurprising that the House of Commons looks like a student party :)
I love it
At least it’s fun to look at
Animo
Neither in French, we only have, if I have to only cite the non-vulgar/crude ones and non-slang ones :
* Faire l'amour : make love
* Avoir une relation sexuelle : have a sexual relationship
* Coucher avec : sleep with
Saying either "avoir du sexe" or "faire du sexe" is incorrect in French; we would understand, but it would sound really weird, and we would spot you are not a native speaker
Late af, but we perpetrate it
There's also ["faire ngolo ngolo dans la case"] by far the most common
That's slang language (never heard anyone say that), I don't talk about slang in my comment
As a reminder to who that gave the ultimate sacrifice in WW1
Came here to say the same thing
First thing that came to my mind as well
Pistolekes met maanzaadjes
The only downside is that you'll find seeds stuck to your teeth until a few hours after you ate it

Don't think so here in Flanders
It's just detective, romance, crime, etc

I doubt Sweden could've remained a great power in Europe into the 18th century, Russia would always have westernised at some point and the coalition of the Great Northern War was simply too much to handle
And if Sweden hadn't lost Finland to Russia in the Napoleonic wars Finland would've still become independent in the 20th century
Yeah, I would love it if North America had more than three countries
or exaple: Florida, Texas, Quebec, Louisiana and maybe even some independent west-coast and native American lands
Just the USA is cool too but things could've been so much more interesting over there
I always wonder how life would be ik a united Benelux
Would it be as divided as Belgium is today
How would politcs be
Would the French speaking part be forced to speak Dutch
IC trains between the North and the South
Nice to think about
You lost me at "under the king of orange Nassau", but a Benelux state would be awesome
Belgian revolution wouldn't have happened if you hadn't oppressed and persecuted us
Flemish Nationalism started because they were oppressed
If you treat the Flemish as equal I am sure the cultural differences would be okay
That's not how 19th century nationalism works, it doesn't care about old political borders
As long as there's a Finnish culture and a Finnish language there's going to be the a push for an independent Finland
Especially with how e.g. Finnish wasn't even a recognised language, or how some notable kings of Swedish in the late 18th and early 19th century had absolutist and/or ultraconservative tendencies (and that's an understatement)

I'm not sure, but I think so as many shops (even butchers) were given fines for selling surgerymasks at "woekerprijzen" when we were low on masks
Right now those are reasonably cheap, while the more fashionable ones can be a bit more pricy but can be used more (wash them)
We don't think about it much at all, and I'm not quite sure why anybody else would either really
The Yalta conference didn't make a single declaration about what would "go to the Soviets" or whatever, it did the opposite and declared that there would be free elections in *all* liberated territories, including those liberated by the Soviets
Whatever you blame on Yalta and Potsdam probably was never even mentioned at those conferences, and is more a fabrication than anything else
I'm gonna explain some of the stuff that actually happened around the end of the war tho
The Baltic states had already been annexed by the USSR back in 1940, the allies never recognised the Soviet annexation so to say they sold you out is disingenuous
Despite that the Soviet control over the Baltics was unfortunately a political fact that could not be reversed
Poland was the only country that was specifically addressed at Yalta
And what they did was reorganise Stalin's provisional government to be more democratic
Stalin had already made it clear even before Yalta that he would have Poland in his sphere no matter what, and with over 6 million men of the Red Army in between them and Poland the British and Americans practically did the most they could to limit Stalin's influence there
The Polish government-in-exile did a lot to sabotage themselves as well, for example they distanced themselves from the rest of the western allies by taking a hard stance against Poland's new border even though everyone else was in agreement, leaving the Soviets with more influence over what would happen in Poland
Some Czechs like to mention how US troops entered Western Bohemia quite early but forget to mention these were relatively small groups only securing the flanks of the 3rd US Army
There were still a million German troops holed up in Czechia
And even then Czechoslovakia was an actual democratic republic in the post-war years
In 1946 the communists got the plurality of the vote in an actual fair election
Fact of the matter was that after the Nazi invasion and soviet liberation communism had become quite popular, even before they finally did a coup in 1948
I don't really know much about the early postwar history of Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria
I do know though that all 3 were axis allies, and thus part of the enemy, you don't really have the right to complain about "being betrayed".
Most people here are probably too dumb to even know about it
The allies couldn't have liberated Czechoslovakia
It's true that US troops entered Western Bohemia quite early but this disregards that fact that that was a relatively small force that was only securing the flanks of the 3rd US Army
There were still a million German troops holed up in Czechia, and a rear guard isn't going to be enough to beat that
The Soviets used 2 million soldiers to defeat the Germans there, which was as many men as the *entire* British army combined at that time
every single one of the conferences had a famous picture with the big 3 though
lol the old territories
You'd have taken the swamps of Belarus, with basically no ethnic Poles anyway, over places like Gdansk, Silesia, and Prussia
I would thinks the Soviets would be on the left side, you know, with them being communist and all
The Red Army was at no point involved in the coup, there weren't even any Red Army troops in Czechoslovakia at the time
The USSR was involved, but not at all in the way you pretend they were
"KGB units were present during 1946-48"^(\[citation needed\])
Also the KGB wasn't part of the Red Army, and I wouldn't be surprised if what you're talking about was actually the Czech StB
I literally said "citation needed" lmao
Those first 3 articles have nothing to do with the coup, which was what we were talking about
That wikipedia article never even claims that "Moscow" was the one behind the assassination attempt, or that the Russians backed it
In fact it literally says it was the work of the Czech communist party lol
>Don't try to be moving goal-posts now
"They initiated a coup backed by the red army to systematically dismantle democracy in the country
" Oh but sure, I'm the one moving goalposts lol
How about you don't ignore the primary subject
Obviously the Russian secret services were in Czechoslovakia
No shit man, they were also in France, the UK, the USA, etc
Everyone had spies everywhere, they still do, so tell us something we didn't know already
&#x200B;
>Who the hell do you think gave them the support and tools to enact these intrigues
Oh yes, because famously all of the "tools" to stage a coup were stacked away in a barn in Moscow, and nobody could get to them without the explicit consent of Stalin
It's not like the Czech communist party had a secret service of its own
It's not like they were in control of both the police and the army
They didn't control the propaganda ministry, the ministry of the interior, etc
Oh no, wait, they already controlled all of those things before they instigated the coup
A couple dozen NKVD agent that, according to your own article, couldn't even speak Czech, aren't going to instigate a coup lol
Not to mention that the very same paragraph you quoted that from just said they were preparing for what would come *after* the takeover
I've been reading through that article and so far literally the **only** thing I've seen about the KNVD is just that people were making sure that the NKVD was aware of what was going on, not that the NKVD was helping to instigate the coup
let be that they were the main driving force or the ones who enabled it
But I suppose it's much easier to blame outsiders for something that was actually done by Czechs
Y'all took a single sentence in one reply, took out out of context of the original discussion and then changed this thread from "the Red Army backed the coup" to the "the kgb backed the coup" and now to just "there were spies in Czechoslovakia". And then you accuse me from moving goalposts and arguing semantic while I'm *literally* telling you people to stay on the original subject
Not that I expected anything else to come from this anyway lol
Also the first thing I said was that the Red Army didn't back the coup, maybe you should scroll back up again
I'm still waiting for any of you people to post a link to an article, preferably academic, that actually shows the red army or kgb played any significant role in that coup
Bro you literally just quoted "***helping to*** instigate the coup" as "instigate the coup" and responded to it with "I didn't say instigate, I said help". You have done nothing but twisting words, taking stuff out of context, and moving goalposts the entire time and then accused me of doing those things while I'm literally telling you to stay on the subject lol
OP said the red army backed the coup, you literally just admitted that the only thing the Red Army *actually* ***did*** was *existing*.
&#x200B;
>explicitly sent to secure the coup
Have yet to see a source that explicitly says those agents were explicitly send to "secure the coup"
&#x200B;
>We're all fully aware the KSČ caused the coup
Noone is arguing otherwise
There is someone, namely *you*. In the next paragraph you say the coup was carried out on the "orders of Moscow". If Stalin ordered the coup then Stalin would have caused, thus instigated, it
That's how these things work
If a leader gives an order he's the one responsible, even if other people carry it out for him
You're acting like Stalin was that leader, you even try to prove it with some whataboutism with other countries (and the accuracy of those claims are something that I could also start arguing about lol)
You're contradicting yourself
I'm gonna keep it real simple, show me a single academic article that explicitly states that the coup was carried out on the orders of Stalin or the KGB, since that seems to be one of the things you're so adamant about
Not gonna bother replying anymore otherwise ~~(not like I'd bother anymore either way)~~. Nothing that has been linked so far has even as much as alleged that Moscow gave the order though, so good luck lol
I'll take one, no, two doses of Swiss salaries please

>Ps British food is unironically not that bad
In comparison to wot
>Wouldn’t say any system from anywhere else in Europe is better lol
Nah, Finnish education system is Top 2 in the world
It's miles better than not just European countries but just many in the world
Oh, I'm dissapointed
It was to give more autonomy to the different language regions
At the time there was a big movement to stop the frenchification of Flanders
It only came 2 years after the Leuven Vlaams movement in 1968 where there were big riots and slogans like: "Walen buiten
" "Walloons go Home
" and sometimes even "Walen Raus
" were used
The protests made the government fall and removed the French part of the KUL to another city called Louvain-la-Neuve literraly meaning 'New Leuven'.
>After all, we did invent chips

You're lucky I'm not actually from Belgium or else I'd go hard

Dutch I will agree with
German
you all just make potatoes and meat in different ways with the same few sauces
I'm originally Jamaican so neither of these cuisines are particularly amaze to me
I do love a Yorkshire pudding tho
I don't think so but nowadays there is some talk to confederate the country but even that isn't super likely to happen I think
Plus if you don't know the two biggest parties in Belgium right now are N-VA and Vlaams Belang, who are both Flemish separatist parties
No, but we should
Belgian Gin I would say
Comes in may different flavours
It's delicious
We call it Jenever
Beer is so popular that our beer culture is recognized as [UNESCO intangible cultural heritage] It's hard to name just one beer, given that there are so many though
I really like the amaretto as well
Yeah, jenever is the first thing that comes to mind for me
Jenever is so good, especially in winter
Hmm vanilla, Hasseltse and cactus
Jenever is called also peket in Wallonia
And there is also Zizi Coin coin, a delicious mix citron-cointreau
I think it's easy to get decent at, especially with all the English programs on tv
But hard to master
Most of my friends could make themselves understandable if need be, but it wouldn't sound perfect by a long stretch
Same for me, it's okay over here since I get to think a bit and edit my words, talking fluently AND correctly is a different matter
I think it's deceptive like that
The language itself I would say is easy to begin with but hard to master(few rules), especially as somebody already learning a Germanic language(I want that frisbee/Ik will die frisbee, the structure is incredibly similar at the beginning)
When it comes to me, I'm dutch so
I was playing with an American in the pool in the South of France when I was 8
There are few times I remember not understanding English
Maybe around that time when I was playing but it could be that I was in general not able to read yet
(so age 5 or so
I just remember knowing what to click but not what the buttons themselves said
By age 12 I was reading English books as well as dutch ones and by age 16 foreigners didn't know if I was a native English speaker or not
(I'm saying foreign because I'm still confident an actual British native could tell from my mix of American and British that I wasn't a native speaker)
By age 18 my thought processes were in English and in many fields I have an easier time expressing myself in English
I don't get why english is hard, public schools should have a good english program because that language is mandatory for becoming an expert in any scientifical or international field
English is easy to learn if you love series or comics
Speaking it is hard though, and pronunciation is harder
Schools should teach the [international phonetic alphabet] (IPA), it's actually easy to learn, and it makes learning any language a lot easier
I don't think it is hard it is easy for most people speaking a west European language
But it can be irritating trying to spell words correctly it is almost impossible to know how to spell something correctly if you are using a word for the first time
Some languages have more reasonable spelling for words but some are also worse
My native language being Dutch and having had a LOT of French in school, while having a little English, I'm way more proficient in English than in French
That's probably due to experiencing a lot more English in daily life and it being in the same language family as my native language, but even when compared to German I find English to be one of the easiest languages
I've studied 5 foreign languages and English was by far the easiest one
Dutch is also my native language and English is by far the easiest to learn, and the one I'm the best at, even though I started having French on school 3 years earlier than English and we've always had like dubble the amount of hours a week of French than English
>I don't think English should remain the default language in the EU institutions
Than what would you want as the default language
German or French would make the most sense, but I don't think many politicians would want to learn either one of them
English is a language that most people speak at least a little
Can confirm that Bulgarian is difficult as hell to learn
My learning experiences are pretty much just reading interviews with Bulgarian artists that I like, there's not much else to use
>Pronunciation is Scandanavian languages is very difficult for me
Very true
Consider yourself fortunate you didn't pick Danish, for your tongue would surely be in a triple knot by now
Because only +24M people speak dutch
We are surrounded by countries that speak other languages and have a higher number of speakers
We do not expect people to learn our language
This is why most dutch speaking people are bilingual or trilingual
I speak Dutch (Standard Dutch and West Flemish) and English
I can understand some french, but speaking back is a bit hard
We learned that Dutch is somewhere between English and German in terms of evolution
A lot of the rules that German has now, were also rules that Dutch had in the middle ages
And English has a lot of similatities with what people predict Dutch will look like in the future
I’m learning it out of interest for slavic languages and Bulgaria :) It’s very hard, but that gives me even more satisfaction every time I make progress
It's that sneaky Latin that caused all of this mess
People would speak correct English :
* University would be used instead of college
* Toilet or WC instead of bathroom
* S instead of z (colonise, realise, apologise etc
instead of the ugly/childish-looking colonize, realize, apologize etc
* -Our instead of -or (colour, favourite, humour, etc
instead of color, favorite, humor)
And probably some other details I don't have in mind right now
The ambivalence
Trying to be a reliable platform for a general public but at the same time trying to be a platform for all kind of sexual or porn niches and extremist ideas
Why with my bicycle of course, they are use for offensive (RING RING YOU IDIOT) or defensive (RING RING I'M OUTTA HERE) actions
That's how the Germans beat the Dutch in WWII, by stealing their bikes
Poor Dutchies were completely powerless
How/why more consistent
Maybe I should have said "standard" English instead, the same way French from France is the standard version of French people learn, and not the Belgian, Swiss or Québec one
American English is perfectly valid and legitimate in USA, but I don't see why it should be elsewhere
I speak Belgian French, but I don't expect people to learn it outside my country
And if I'm abroad, I would use the French one, because it is the one that is legitimate internationally
Otherwise, using American English in Europe doesn't make any sense to me
British English is what I learnt, and it makes more sense to me
Saying "bathroom" or "restroom" is just a relic of American prudishness and Christian fanaticism; WC or Water Closet makes much more sense, toilet is better too
Z's instead of s's look like mispelling, as z is a loan letter
In my country, what you call a "college" (called "haute-école" here, as a "collège" is a Catholic secondary school, so, a school where people from 12 to 18 y.o go) ) is seen as something quite different from a university, and thus, grouping them both with the same name is odd; college =/= university, two different goals : one gives you a professional degree, teach you a job, the other gives you an academic degree
If we have to call them collectively, there is a more accurate term : higher education
Because it is the standard English
Why would we learn American English in Europe
When you learn French, you learn French from France right
Not the one from Belgium, Switzerland or Québec
These are totally valid locally, but they aren't the standard version of the language
Same goes with American English : valid in USA, but outside of it, British English is the legitimate and standard one
I will one up you: the Belgian city of Mons/Bergen is a completely different word depending on which part of Belgium you are in (its the French/Dutch word for 'mountains')
If you are not aware of the meaning of those words, there is no way to make the connection
In Dutch, s and k are switched: Grieks
Norwegians used to say Grekenland, but like for sooooooo many placenames, they decided to make it fancier in the second half of the previous century
Another interesting thing that happened is British soldiers giving making dutch town names sounding English, but in doing so using real English nouns, so it has some (nonsense) meaning thus a link to reality
The only example I can think of right now:
Dutch: Ploegsteert
English: Plugstreet
It's very obvious there's a phonetical link between the names, but it's also unique they used real nouns: A plug and a street
I was quite amazed when I found out about this and I don't think this happened in other contexts
You also use the spelling from 1914, like Passchendaele instead of the contemporary Passendale
> English uses the French name for a lot of Belgian cities, including some Flemish ones
There's an evolution to move away from that and use the Dutch name for Flemish cities
So while in older English texts you often saw *Malines*, *Louvain* or *Alost*, nowadays it's Mechelen, Leuven and Aalst
The names of *Bruges* and *Ypres* are of course too engrained now so those will probably remain
"Ghent" is based on old Dutch spelling, but it also happens to emphasise that it's not pronounced like the "gent" in "gentleman" :)
I think this varies by region
I'm from East-Flanders, and nobody uses Firenze here
Dutch: Aken
Some more:
Wallonia: Tournai = Doornik, Mons = Bergen, Braine-l'Alleud = Eigenbrakel, Nivelles = Nijvel, Soignies = Zinnik
France (although nowadays the French name is used more): Valenciennes = Valencijn, Cambrai = Kamerijk, Douai = Dowaai, Roubaix = Robaais
Don't forget Charles V's birthplace Gante (Ghent - Gent), he was also raised in Malinas (Mechelen)
Underrated comment
I mean I'm East-Flanders too (close to Ghent), and didn't even know that it was a thing to say "Florence" in Dutch
Your point still stands, I guess
But it's not that in East-Flanders nobody uses "Firenze".
English doesn't have words starting with unaspirated p. The closest pronunciation would be "Baitching" or something
As a Catalan, unaspirated p and aspirated p might sound similar, but a Chinese would disagree
Some Chinese people don't listen to how voiced a sound is, they only distinguish aspirated and unaspirated
English speakers say "Bay Jing". This pronunciation is perfectly fine
Dworp = Tourneppe
Well, in Dutch at least, Peking is stressed on the first syllable, while Beijing is stressed on the second one
I can hear the difference between [ɕ] and [ʃ] well, however, I find it hard to hear a difference between [ʃ] and [ʂ]
This last sound is one that I definitely mispronounce in Swedish
To a Chinese person, the English word spill sounds like "sbil". You are right that they won't think of [ʃ] as [ɕ], but English doesn't have a sound that looks more like it
[k] sounds even less like it
Maps
me is pretty well known among travelers for being very detailed all over the world
Absolutely not, both of them are correct in the context of a conversation
Britanique is grammatically and phonetically correct, and I've been in tons of situations in which I've heard francophones refer to you guys as "les Britaniques".
Nop, that's straight-up weird
Tough, just like how some francophones might refer to the United States as "Les US" instead of shortening les États-Unis (which would result in EU, bringing even more confusion), you might also stumble upon French speakers simply referring to the United Kingdom as "UK".
As an example : "J'suis parti aux UK pendant les dernières vacances".
Nah it doesn't get shortened at all, most francophones tend to refer to the EU simply as "l'Europe" (making no distinction between the EU and the European continent), but then again, I come from Belgium, which is a very europhile country
However, I've heard Frenchies refer to the EU in casual talk as l'Europe as well, and to my knowledge, l'Union Européene is only used in formal and official contexts
In a casual conversation
I've never heard it to be quite honest, but I might be mistaken
Yw pal

A take-out pizza will set me back 12 to 20 depending on the size
In Dutch:

Translated literally:

> - N is for not surviving
Almost exactly the same
Now I remember why we would usually watch the german dub
Cursive
I find it crazy that some people don't learn it, or don't start with it
It's so much quicker to write
To me, handwriting is automatically and always cursive
Cursive, that's the only way we are taught to write
Personally, it takes me hours to write in print script, i can't do it fast, and it is rather ugly
With cursive, it's much easier to do callygraphy, to write nicely
I learned handwriting first if that's what you mean
exactly
Same
It actually kinda sucks because mine is not particularly legible
I wish I could write in print without it taking hours
Cursive is normal hand writing though, hand-writing print letters is the not normal thing
I didn't know the word until I saw it here on Reddit
It's simply when you link your letters when you write words, while print is when you write each letter individually, without connection to the others
We are planning to take a trip to salzburg and read somewhere that there and in berchtesgaden they filmed the sound of music

Why would there be anything wrong with octopus
It's some pretty good food if you ask me
Honestly, they're just too damn creepy for me
They're like the alien spiders of the sea
Isn't that like everywhere
Fried octopus rings and such seems about as common as chicken nuggets if one doesn't count McDonald
Basically available in most places that have cheap, friend food for you to pick out
Also, why the fuck would eating basically anything be weird
Uncommon
Maybe
But not weird
I actually love the taste of it
I had very delicious octopus salad in Portugal, but have not had the guts to order a whole one
It still freaks me out a bit
West-Flanders for being farmers who literally nobody understands and Limburg for being slow and calling [this] a 'long hamburger'.
In Flanders definetly West Flanders, which is where I'm from
For Wallonia I do not really know for sure, but I have heard jokes about nobody living in (Belgian) Luxembourg
I'd say Charleroi
The airport is named "Brussels-South" because if you tell passengers they arrive at Charleroi, they wouldn't want to get out of the plane
It is sometimes said it is a dirty city because of the many coal mines that were created in the region
The is also Herstal, near Liège, were one can find the finest barakis (a more or less equivalent of rednecks/gopniks/beauf/racaille/you name it) of Wallonia
Unfortunately, I can't say much about Flanders, maybe someone can help
Limburg is often portrayed as being backwards
Hela, ik ben van regio Maasland en daar zegt niemand lange hamburger, dat hoor je vooral in Zuid-Limburg ^^
Then we have people from Antwerp (city) who think they are the centre of the world's attention
They have a phrase that goes: "Antwerp is the city and the rest is parking space".
People from Ghent are progressive vegetarians who ride bakfietsen (bikes with a container in the front) and lot of them are students
People from Aalst are people who live on the margins of society, hence the nickname 'Marginaalst'. They're also famous for their carnival, which is quite vulgar
Leuven is full of students, more of the posher kind, but nothing else
The town is basically dead during the holidays
Brussels is either full of radical Muslims (Molenbeek) or Francophones who hate Flemish people and speaking Dutch
Liège has this weird love affair with France even though French radicals burned down their cathedral during the French Revolution
They also like to think they are different than the rest of Wallonia
People from Namur are rather slow (Walloon Limburgers) and that's why they have a snail as their symbolic animal
Charleroi is a depressing place and people who can afford to leave it do
Industrial decline at its finest
And Wallonia
It's not so much the provinces and more the cities (like Charleroi and Liège, especially the former) that have reputations for having a lot of "barakis". Luxembourg is empty and people from Namur speak super slowly
It's a curryworst
Or as it's widely known as frikandel
Ah dat wist ik niet
Maasland's got its own kind of problems though
The Liégeois destroyed the cathedral Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Lambert themselves
At the time of the révolution liégeoise which began simultaneously with the French Revolution in 1789, the merchants who saw the cathedral as a source of cheap raw material influenced the revolutionaries who thus made the decision to destroy it
Plus it was considered a symbol of the Prince Bishop's power
The destruction began in 1795, the place remained a heap of ruins for more than 3 decades until 1827 when the place was finally leveled
A huge loss since this jewel of Gothic architecture culminated at 134
5m high, making it the tallest cathedral in the Benelux
Since the new Republic of Liège was not well received in Europe at that time, the Liégeois voted to join the French Republic, hence their connivance (this and other things later such as the world wars)
Frikandel are not the same as currywurst
We don't know what is inside of the Frikandel
Huh interesting, I thought the French did it considering that it happened during the French Revolution
It's very rare for a religious site to be completely destroyed by the city's own inhabitants
Yes it's pretty rare because that's stupid
but they did anyway
Yeah I know that but I am sure that it's not curry
Frans-Vlaanderen terug Vlaemsch

We have a lot of things to improve in Europe too, but, no, I would not live in the US
The main reasons are : gun problems, impossible health costs, limited polical choices and to many religious nuts
No, I wouldn't. For living in a first world country, it just doesn't sound like an improvement in any way
It would ask too many sacrifices without getting anything back in what I value
If I would move to another first world country, it would be to a country with much higher standards on equality, health care and education among others
These things seem to be ok in the usa if you're rich, which I'm not
No, my reasoning behind it is that the US is capitalistic and imperialistic
This conflicts with most of my world views
You're goverment is always looking for war/conflict and it does not matter if you have a GOP or DEM president in office
Also looking at how you your country treats immigrants/asylum seekers from the southern regions how would you want me to live in a country that actively separates mother and child
They are just looking for a better live for their children
You either deny them at point or accept them
Not this "punishment".
So no thanks, I rather stay in my little country
This is why i would not want to live in the US

So no thanks, I rather stay in my little country
No, my reasoning behind it is that the US is capitalistic and imperialistic
This conflicts with most of my world views
You're goverment is always looking for war/conflict and it does not matter if you have a GOP or DEM president in office

Because it's really hard to become a citizen of Monaco
In belgium we have the same, but the other half work 40 hrs
40 hrs do included overtime which you can take as a holliday or as money
Some even work 50 hrs and more
Ofcourse they do, well at least in my family
Even about their period and the kind of anticonception they use(d) and that worked or didn't work for them
I don't ask them about it, but as a guy I don't think those subjects should be taboo if they want to talk about it
I think this is somewhat the same across the country
Edit: Funny how a comment about a subject about this can turn into a huge debate, only because I used a less known synonym for birth control
Not one comment about the subject-matter, only about a single word I used
Nice
My (M) mum loves talking about her pregnancies and how easy or difficult her labour was depending on the sibling, so I never thought of it as a "touchy" subject for close family members
I guess it's different if a woman miscarries or if she goes through a postnatal depression
Both are correct
Me too
Anticonception is clear 'anti' 'conception' while contraception comes from 'contra'  'conception' -> contraception
Germany is Duitsland
Estonia is Estland
And the lands south of Estonia are Letland and Litouwen
If you're going to literally translate Duitsland, it's Germanland rather than Dutchland
Latvia is Lettonie
Leeuw van Vlaanderen  by Hendrik Consience
Hendrik Consience was a Flemish writer is is considered to be the writer who taught the Flemish to read
(1812-1883)
'In Flander's fields' is also a good contender imo
I learned wah more about that than about de Leeuw van Vlaanderen at school
But it's not written by a Belgian so I get why it couldn't really be a national poem
I would say Tijl Uilenspiegel for al Dutch speakers
Nevertheless, thats a great suggestion aswell
yeah, i would go more with this or even reynard de vos
De leeuw van Vlaanderen is too politicised
Then again, with our country being split along linguisitic lines, its next to impossible to have a true national poem
Maybe the wonderfully Belgian website of [houtinfobois
be] or something truely bilingual
Boars,deers and wolves but not in my region tough
About the wolves a "funny" story: a year ago the first wolf was spoted  and a few weeks later another one
Iwas taking a shower in the morning and they were talking about the second spoted wolf on the radio a few hours later they said the wolf died becaus some one drove him over that day
The only wild animal I see “regularly” is a hedgehog
I’ve seen 2 deer here in the wild in my entire life
It’s depressing how little wild animals I see here in Belgium
Oh and rats, RATS EVERYWHERE
Disgusting little pests annoy my chickens
It’s a plague
Meanwhile in my usual holiday spot in Germany I have to watch out when I walk the dog at nightfall because then the giant ass deer start to roam around
You have to be careful when driving because foxes cross the street day and night
You need to be extra careful for deer because they move around in large groups once nightfall starts so you encounter them both by car and by foot
Conclusion:
Belgium: only rats & Hedgehogs
When I’m in Germany (Harz region): foxes & deer everywhere
We know it was accorded to them because of corruption, and yet they are still allowed to organise it
We will be playing soccer in the fucking desert in a country that gives not a single fuck about the sport, they had to shop together a national team FFS
I hoped that nations would boycot it but that would require having a spine
it sucks  :
\-timing
\-heat
\-human rights violations
The Qatar team is actually quite decent, they even won the last AFC Asian Cup, the Asian equivalent of the UEFA Euro tournament
And as someone else said the level of the national team shouldn't be the deciding factor to choose a host
But I agree on the corruption part, ofc they bribed FIFA to host it
I won't watch it either
The Qatar national team isn't that atrocious really
Of course no Russia or Germany or Brazil, but I don't think that should matter really
If somehow San Marino manages to have all infrastructure etc to organize a competent World Cup, I'd gladly see them play there
And several died in the construction of some stadiums I believe
For me, it really depends on the country
I found that Sweden and Denmark have quite a good cuisine, although not as varied as others
On the other hand, I view Norway as the darkest pit of culinary doom
But true, the Southern European food is just delicious
I don't really know why, it's just what I (and most people I assume) like best
It's pretty much unknown, but not considered to be boring or bland
My first guess about what to expect is a very wide variety of seafood and probably a variation on what's Knödel in austria
I don't know that many Scandinavian (or northern european) restaurants, but those we have in Brussels are considered to be top class
I don't think Belgian/French food is boring at all
Climate and Protestantism
Sure, not being able to grow a frivoulous olive or sunny peach plays a huge role, But don’t ignore the sober and austere mentality of Protestants: ‘It’s only supposed to feed you, not taste good’. As opposed to the indulgences and follies of the Catholics
That's just because spices were not as available than today
Today, everyone can add that hint of spice to make the meal more exciting
Italian nonna's make the best
Period
It was obviously exaggerated as a joke, but I have traveled twice in Norway (1998 and 2006, so that isn't very recent) and I don't remember anything interesting about the food
There was good fish of course, but that is a bit generic for all Northern countries
Products with blackberries were nice too
I also remember some stuff (I'm not sure what it was exactly) that we really didn't like and used as bait for fishing
Overall, the main thing I remember is that it was super expensive and not-so-good
Same with Iceland by the way
The quality/price ratio was far lower than what can be found in Southern countries
edit: I remember about elk or deer sausage too
Saint Empire Romain Germanique
There's both "Roman" and "Germanic"
Oddly enough, despite the fact Romance-speaking Belgium was part of it from its foundation until 1795, like the French people we call it too "Saint Empire Romain germanique" (Germanic HRE), despite the fact there were many non-Germanic parts in it, including us
That must be a Netherlands thing because in Belgium we say Heilig Romeinse Rijk
How do you distinguish it from the actual Roman Empire
TIL
In recent times I've seen a lot of cases where dutch in the Netherlands differs from that in Belgium in small ways
Very interesting imo
In Flanders we have TAK: Taal Aktie Komitee, they mainly try to keep the cities bordering Wallonia completely Dutch
They will paint over the French city name for example
But they are generally known for trying to keep Flanders a completely Dutch-speaking country
It's not like they will invent new words, but they insist on using the less popular Dutch words if they exist
They are definitely part of the Flemish movement, so most members will also vote for Vlaams Belang or N-VA
Er is toch geen enkel probleem met faxen en cancelen

We actually use it in automation work, when we put the program into the automates
when I was a kid I thought cum was the past tense of "to come" which made for some awkward convos looking back
Trough, though, thought, taught, tough, touch, etc
For the life of me, I can't remember how to writ awsner the right way
I know I just wrote it wrong, that's just how it comes out every time
Word and world
So similar
I know what the words mean and I never get confused by their meaning, but I often mess up when I speak
Eddy Wally, nah its Tintin
Our king literally made Spielberg a honorary knight cause he made a movie about Tintin
And also we have everything Tintin, Tintin chocolate, Tintin planes, Tintin trains, Tintin museums (multiple)
Pater Damiaan who helpt people with a deadly disease (don’t now how to say it in English) on an island where all the sick where just dumped and when he got the disease as well he kept on helping them and he made houses and tools for the sick until he died from the disease himself
Didn't even know that
WW2 still directly or indirectly has an impact on the entire world today so yeah
In belgium some flemish nationalists still refer to ww1 when there where foot soldiers whom were dutch speaking and could not understand or speak french, were given orders in french
Also i think, i am the last generation of people that still had family that was old enough during the war to remember it and to tell stories concerning ww1 and ww2
So there is a generation of people being lost whom still had certain personal stories and memories to the war
History books will discuss in great detail how the appointment of BoJo to deal with Brexit lead to WW3
Not specifically culturally isolated, but lots of posts on /r/chronicpain and /r/migraine are about stuff related to US healthcare and I really can't relate to that whatsoever
I feel quite sorry for them to be honest; it's already incredibly rough to survive through everyday life with chronic migraines and chronic pain and I can hardly keep my healthcare stuff and general paperwork up to date, because my head is out of business for half of the time due to the pain - I think I would've completely drowned in the US system and drop dead out of sheer misery
Yes, I especially hate the US-centric identity politics and how there's a silent implication that the US is the only relevant country for race related issues
Like if you bring up a criticism on their ideas of progressiveness / liberalism they go bonkers and assume you're a US white male
And they just stop replying or just can't really grasp the fact you're from europe and have such an opinion, since they also prop up western and northern europe as the perfect regions of socialism and democracy lmao
Which ironically makes them very bigoted in my eyes
I notice this behavior a lot, like speaking in place of cultures they don't really understand but claiming to defend
It fits into my overall idea about (of course, not all
but generally my experience) Americans as friendly, but EXTREMELY concerned with what people think of them (while they will simultaneously claim they don't), so it can be a very fake kind of friendly, and they will do stupid things to get acknowledgement from their peers I guess
This post went a little out of scope and became a rant about americans here haha, just want to conclude with I love interacting with americans who visit Belgium and this is something mostly confined to reddit
Someone else said something similar (e: /u/knorknorknor ) but I have trouble agreeing with the American premises of life
For instance their addiction to self-help in all books and quotes subreddits
It's always the story of how you solve all your problems through sheer individual will
I think we have much more the reflex of saying you need to rely on your friends and loved ones in though times, and that often change needs to be done in the environment around you and not "your mindset". But if you tell that to Americans many would consider you fatalistic or a leech to people around you
Also the partisanship of their politics is weird as hell
It's like a political discussion can't be abstracted from the two parties in power
>I was obviously lying as well as a hipster when I said I didn't know anyone who eats their fries with ketchup
My dad threatened to disown me everytime I put ketchup on my fries instead of mayonnaise

Oh lovely
Adopted a senior myself a month ago
I would get 10 senior cats if I could, but [this lovely lady] doesn't like to share human attention (does great with other cats when no humans around though) and would get upset and frustrated if I'd get another cat, or dog, or kid, or whatever :p
A Fiesta from '99 :)
the best way to enjoy this sub is to forget it and then suddenly have a post "Enjoy this TIGHT pussy"show up in your front page
I had a dream last night about how my cat was all happy rolling around in the grass in a big garden and now I'm thinking of moving
Absolutely
I even feel like my personality while speaking English is effecting my personality in my native language
It doesn't change my personality at all
It's just a language
Yes, I become more social, I find it easier to socialize with strangers in English
Probably because I went to study abroad 2 times where automatically you become more social, and I still associate English with being in a social mood or something
I have had conversations in English with random people that I can't really imagine myself having in my own language, to be fair
It's pretty strange
*Sapir-Whorf hypothesis intensifies*
I speak 5 languages, does this mean I have 5 different personalities
With that accent it's pretty hard to take a Dutch person serious when he's angry
Quite the same in Belgium, we always ay that it's good money even if it's not extremely high
Brussels: Ugly, pollution, corrupt, traffic jams
Antwerp: harbor, drugs, arrogant people, diamond industry, Jews, also pollution, also traffic jams
Ghent: liberal, students, canals, old architecture
Bruges: tourists, canals, old architecture, football
Charleroi : airport, dirty, collapsed industry
Leuven: university, Stella
Old  buildings from 1700 where you can live in
Adding some for the south:
Dinant: saxophones and kayaking
Durbuy: smallest city
Brussels: a lot of immigrants (like every capital), tourists, EU capital
Bruges: **Chinese** tourists
Charleroi: poor
Liège: students, oufti, nightlife, train station
Namur: pretty, university, slow, government
Louvain-la-Neuve: student city, university, pedestrian-friendly, special architecture
We had a few "grenade attacks" around antwerp, supposedly drugs related
Huge drug import problem due to the port, mostly cocaine from Latin America
Drug traffickers were left alone for decades, the current city council started a war on drugs, this stirred some shit, and now drug gangs fight for their niche on the streets at night with hand grenades, mostly in residential neighbourhoods, blowing up cars of their rivals, for intimidation and to discourage politicians on the war on drugs by swaying public opinion
Almost always only material damage
Same story hits the national news every other week
My man
To add to that you also have
Louvain La neuve: Study town
Kinda like Leuven except in French
Mons: I actually have no clue but apparently it’s big (duh) and i’m pretty sure it was the culture capital of europe at some point
La louvière: Pretty much like Charleroi except way more crummy
This is new to me
By the way, I did a quick Google search of the drug capitals of Europe
And I found this article of the [Daily Mail]
Unsurprisingly, Antwerp came in third
The interesting thing is, they put a Dutch flag next to it
To who
They discover more drug networks than before, they catch and arrest more drug lords and corrupt port workers, and they discover record amounts of drugs in cargo containers, but it seems it only shows how big the problem actually was and still is
So depending on who you ask, it's working but it will take a very long, sustained effort, or it's not effective and it's only making the city unsafe for innocent citizens
I think that more countries will join (Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro etc) and not a lot of countries will follow the UK
At least here in Belgium, the we-should-leave-the-EU-sentiment has almost vanished since the Brexit
Because more countries will join, the structure will probably change - but I have no idea how it could change
I also think the EU will continue harmonizing more and more laws, even in private law, so the differences between law in different countries will become smaller and smaller
For me i hope it falls apart, that a lot more will leave
Europe is not that good in my eyes, costs too much money and they abuse their power in the EU parliament by coming in signing and leaving directly just to collect their money
They will enforce new rules and taxes that aren’t needed
Just my opinion
the next top-5 contributor is ready to leave
But sssst dont even try to get it into your brain if you were on state-propaganda the last years
the old xenophobes voted Remain
Private law is for example the laws concerning contracts
They’re already slowly starting to harmonize those laws
I mean that they come in put their autographs in the book collect the +300€ for the day and leave within 5 min
Thats what i meant with abusing power
I still believe a country is it strongest on their own not to dance for others
The whole system needs to change
Since the Euro was introduced everything went to shit and got a lot more expensive
And then there is that drunk that’s head of the EU
I never believed in it and it never will
The only positive is that you can travel without stopping at every border
But that’s all for me
The EU has cost us all a lot of money for some stupid elites that don’t care for people of lower and mid class
IIRC you can't join the EU with ongoing territorial disputes
Unless they're super tiny, or you're Cyprus
Yeah, I think so too, especially for contracts between people of different countries (which often happens when buying stuff second-hand online)
It's like that everywhere
I blame the lack of political subjects in school
If young people would've been taught about the political system at school, they would show more interest and actually vote on stuff that concerns them
Instead it is left up to them to discover it and as a result, the older generations will always have a heavier turnout (relatively) then the young ones
I say scrap the two hours of religion in the schools, and replace it with one hour of philosophy (in which you can include religious teachings) and one hour of politics
It’s not that you don’t want to invade countries, it’s that you can’t : Just try to invade India, with their army and nukes, or Africa and their suicidal guerrileros
Plus it’s better to exploit their economy by installing puppets at their heads rather than developping them with infrastructure and things like that, which cost money
Same thing for us, except when Leopold went ancap
Ssssshhhh no, it's al the British Empire's fault
C'mon now
Do you consider Bulgaria ruling a bunch of europeans land that were not Bulgarian an empire ?
I think another thing we must not forget is that Germany was not a good country led by a bad leader
Hitler was the result of democracy in action
There was resistance, but there was also widespread support
Many soldiers didn't commit atrocities because they had to
They did it because they wanted to
I don't say this because we should all be angry at Germans in 2020, I say this because it's important we know so we can see when it's happening again
I mean the USSR had a lot of qualities
You mean Northern-Belgians
« I think the germans learned the wrong lessons »
« They need to defend democracy »
Hello i’m american and the germans should do the same thing we do : 1
Bombard a country, 2
Destroy their lives and cities, 3
Warcrimes  4
Now it’s a perfect democracy
Enjoy, Iraqis
As a citizen of a country, you need to share the burdens of responsability
The british east indian company was british, and the german reich was still german and the kongo belche was still belgian
Not really, i think the roman legacy is more of an latin one, even if Italy is clearly the most important bit
What do portuguese think about Savimbi tho ?
Maat, die grap werd zoveel keer naar ons gericht
Enkele keren andersom kan geen kwaad
They can tho, don’t forget the mass orgy that was the roman empire and the many natives that were fully integrated into the roman society

'Dos cervezas por favor'
Because it was a song in the Flemish part of Belgium a while ago
Dos cervezas por favor
Jeg spiser ikke fisk
~ Norwegian
Tua madre si e fata mangiare da una anatra, l'anatra pensava que era una nocciolina
I think it has absolutly no sense but i love to say it ( I don't speak italian and noone I know (but my italian friend who told it to me) does
Vannas putas (i think this means bath foam in Latvian)
In Spanish, mostly profanity laden quotes from Narcos
Dos cervezas por favor

Don't care about things happened in the past, a German Hakuna matata
I didn't even really know of this one
AND IT'S IN MY OWN LANGUAGE
That’s the first thing Belgian Dutch speakers will teach foreigners lol
A man of culture i see
Genau
Well, now I know
And I won't forsake my duty from now on
I have so many Gogos at home
I loved these little guys
I liked center parcs as a kid because of the amazing pools, now I don't like it anymore because I find the houses too small and especially the beds aren't long enough
But it's indeed nostalgic
Same ahahah
Don't watch the Geography Now video about Belgium
Half the episode is wrong
His other videos are great but somehow the Belgium episode is super bad
I think [this] is a pretty good video explaining why we're so divided, although it has some mistakes
There's [this guy] from the US that biked around Belgium visiting all of the trappist breweries
Can't get much more Belgian than that
It's also really well filmed and put together
Same
Not Just Bikes is awesome
Too bad for him he's stuck with us cause he said he'd rather have more global viewers who could learn a thing or two about Dutch infrastructure
I'll add here that there aren't really any good YouTubers about Belgium that I know of but [this] documentary is still one of my favorites
Belgium is a lot more than a few bad roads and some political anomalies, and it's about time people get that
Are there any video's/channels covering anything other than our complicated political system
It would be nice if there were channels/video's covering our food, local festivals or special sites within Belgium
Every video has mistakes, but it's not like almost half of the episode is wrong in most of his videos
I'm sure there are top 10 videos about 'things to visit' or 'things you didn't know about Belgium'. Also [a video about our Army] and [lots]  [of] [history] [videos] and one about our [languages] Just to name a few
However there's very few video's on cultural stuff
We have some peculiar stuff going which could be well suited to a short video
I imagine you could make a 10 min video on the festivities of Het Ros Beiaard in Dendermonde, or about the Gilles of Binche, where you can have some nice exposition shots while explaining the history about it
Right now I'm pretty sure Tom Scott has more exposition video's on Belgian peculiarities than there are video's made by Belgians
In another life, I would have gone into history in uni and I'm pretty sure I would be making them myself, however I went another path and can't really spare the time doing it myself
Yeah you're sadly right
Although I didn't even know Tom Scott has made videos about Belgium
Moved from Belgium to the UK about half a year ago, also to be with a loved one
Im not a fan of the UK much, but my partner and i try to make the best out of it
As long as you two being together makes you happy, itll be alot easier
But, if you really really dont like the country you moved to, you might want to discuss this with your partner and maybe see if you both could settle down somewhere in the future that you both like
I personally dont want to settle down in the UK, and neither does my partner, and we have discussed this before
It really helps to talk about it
[Rendez-vous by Pas de Deux]
The version they song after winning the Belgian nomination is even [more cringing] (starts at 2:39)
Oh that was a trainwreck indeed
Uhm, it's one of the best
Worst: so much to choose from
The most recent horrible one was Mother in 2014
That song actually aint bad tbh
That was actually funny
It's a common mistake countries who send joke entries make: if the joke isn't funny, you don't have a lot going for you anymore
Copycat in 2009 was leagues worse
Had nothing going for it
Not wearing them but usually they are planted on memorial, further more in Ypres and passchendaele
There is also the Daisy but I haven't seen it anywhere else than in the Ardenne
We don't even wear them in Belgium, where a big chunk of the battles were fought
And I don't think they do in France
It's solely a British thing to wear them
We do lay poppies near the graves of the soldiers of WO1 to remember the fallen
Only during the memorial day, and then only in Yper, I think
Theyre not worn alot, mainly on the coast during times to remember WW1, but they are in alot of places such as graves and monuments, because the poppy signifies Flanders Fields(yes, like the poem/song)
So while for us its a remembrance symbol for WW1, for the British its to remember their soldiers
As far as i know we're the only ones that really use it
Yes
One of the elementary schools in my village is even called "Red Poppy". But my village has a WW-addiction
Yes, because in French "Czech Republic" is already : Tchéquie, no one bothers itself calling it "République tchèque". So Czechia is much better name, much less tedious to say and write than "Czech Republic".
I mean, we don't go around saying "Kingdom of Belgium" instead of Belgium, or "German Federal Republic" instead of Germany, etc
so why make a exception for Czechia
I kinda do it on reflex anyway from Tsjechië to Czechia is just way easier to remember
Yes I like it because I don't see why we would call it the Czech Republic
Just like everyone says France and not the French Republic
Also, in Dutch we say Tsjechië so it makes sense to also say Czechia
Same as many here, it is called Tsjechië in Dutch which works fine
But "Czechia" in English just sounds odd yet doesn't have a good alternative
Suppose the main question is whether Anglophones can get used to it
Does it have to be the current country or do empires where we belonged to also count
Otherwise this is gonna be 1 sad game for Belgians
I really like the flags of our [Air Force] and of our [Navy] I also like the flag used by [the United Belgian States]
The one of the [Austrian Low-Countries] when what would become Belgium was part of the Austrian Empire
Bring back the empire already
The white one wins when it comes to royal flags, but your current flag is pretty hard to beat l. One of the best out there, such a nice shade of blue
I also don't like the gold in your flag
People say we stole your flag
As a symbol of nationalism
I actually like the flag of the [Belgian marine]
>the UBS
Yes bby inject that flag into my veins
Aesthetically speaking ofc
Which is kinda ironic, since the Belgian flag (1830) is older than the German flag (1871 or 1848 at best)
Yeah I know
I saw something today that said that Belgium actually has one of the oldest flags in tye world (like top 15 I think)
Yes and it's not even close with the second oldest
Have you never read or heard anyone say "ik gun het hem wel"?
That's actually a really good example
Imagine you like someone but that person gets in a (good) relationship with someone else
You are obviously *jaloers*, because you wanted that
That *jaloersheid* can develop in *afgunst* if you try to sabotage it with ill intent (negative), or it can stay healthy  because you see how happy they are and don't want to ruin it and try to let it go (neutral)
A positive example is that you are slightly *jaloers* of some because they are naturally good at something where you aren't as good at
For example, when I hear random people singing good or see them draw beautiful things I'm *jaloers*, because at that moment I wish that I was even half as good at that as they are
*Jaloersheid* can be accompanied by admiration, while *afgunst* never is
Wha in the netherlands too
I thought it was a dialect
Altho in West flanders we say: jalezienn (yes double n)
Fair enough
Jaloezie is pretty much used by everyone during daily life
Afgunst only has few uses these days
Not *that* rare though, I still hear it often enough
I'm from a town of 20k and when traveling say 30 kilometers away some people will notice the accent and ask if I'm from the town I am
Several dialects will get subtitled on television
I am not intimately familiar with the Dutch dialect groups from the Netherlands, but the Belgian varieties come in 4 large groups:
\- West Flemish
\- East Flemish
\- Brabantian
\- Limbourgish
And that's just a rough division, some of the dialects within each stand out (Ghent dialect is quite different from most other East-Flemish varieties)
It's quite rich considering how geographically small we are
Even worse
West Flemish is a protected language in France but not in Flanders
Accents aren't dialects
You have the same thing with French you know : only one official written form and official pronounciation
You just have different accents and a few local words, but as a whole, in Europe, French is very uniform
Antwerp is also big for fashion and cocaine
Also Antwerp is the place for the chemical industry
The news mentions both, but when talking about vaccines in general they say 'Phizer vaccine' for short
'based in the US'
Pfizer is an American company, but all the vaccine we and the rest of the world get is produced in Belgium
So it's not really a Europe vs
America thing, rather Belgium vs
Germany
Janssen is a Flemish company in the province of Antwerp
Let's see: Dank u, thank you, Danke, tak, takk, takk, takk (?) (ok maybe that's cheating a bit, don't know how you spell the Swedish one though), kiitos, merci, grazie, gracias, obrigado/-a, ευχαριστώ, spasiba (don't know how to write cyrillic)
Fourteen something
The ones I know are: merci, gracias, grazie, danke, dank u, díky, takk, tak, tack, thank you, ευχαριστώ.
I can say thank you in Dutch, French, German, English, Swedish, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Russian and greek, which makes 11 if I can still count
> Danish (and Norwegian if it's the same word)
And Swedish and Icelandic too then
Honest question, I understand that Scottish Gaelic is pretty moribund but are there many Scottish people who don't even know how to say thanks in that language
Glad to hear your optimism
I don't know any Celtic languages myself but I have fond memories of a trip to the Isle of Mull when I was a wee lad (aha), with beautiful Scottish Gaelic music playing in the car and picking up some of those beautiful sounds on the streets
And maybe it's only sensible to focus more on the preservation of the Scots language on the east coast instead of trying to forcibly introduce and try to educate a language that's been gone there for a long time, because that could create some hate for the language like in Ireland
Cheers
Quite ignorant
Bicky burger recently had a campaign in which a man slabbed a woman for “not giving him a real Bicky burger”, it got a lot of backlash as well because it promotes domestic violence
Not gonna lie
A cocktail called "twin towers" sounds like I would wanna drink it
Taking shots with friends sound fun indeed
National-Liberalism
Was kicked out of Malaysia and Singapore's leader was crying on tv for that
Now they're rich and have strict laws (no chewing gum), I think they have the best schools, but because of that there's a high suicide rate (too much pressure)
City state
Ok this is pretty weird but isn't it famous because it grows so quickly it's sinking into the ground ?
You thought i was going to say Nat-Zhee ?
The park between the parliament and the royal palace in Brussels is full of patriotic symbolism but through the years it gained an extra one
The different roads in the park point (some on purpose others came later) towards the most influential institutions for Belgium
To the palace And the parliament, the European parliament, the palace of justice, the Brussels cathedral but also Belgium's biggest bank and the American Embassy
Do you know Louis De Geer "the father of the Swedish steel industry"? What do you think about the Walloon immigration to Sweden
We have them too but we call them smoutebollen
Vinkenzetting[Vinkenzetting] let's all go sit alongside a closed road with birds in a blinded cage and everytime the bird sings a certain  melody: 'suskewiet' you can put a mark on a black stick with chalk
Belgium has the occasional world class skater, be careful we're coming for your gold
Wait is it a long/big jump or several smaller one ? Also should we wear protective equipment ?
Belgian politicians take themselves too seriously to have any weird parties
In fact, they all try so hard to be normal that they end up copying each other for about 95% of their programmes
On the other hand, our entire political system is weird enough with 6 different governments, people I can't vote for because I don't live in the same part of our tiny country as those people becoming prime minister, ... Guess it's silly enough without the weird parties
The Pirate Party
It supports drastic reform of copyright law, the legalization of cyber-piracy, and the abolition of patents
As far I know, there are plenty of other pirate parties in the world, they even have some kind of international rally, and the Belgian one is a founding member
why are they not in power
I think VB would deffinitly fall under the catagory 'weird'
> Last election there was also the so-called pirate party
I have no idea  what their standpoints are but they didn’t make it either
There are  always some weird new parties every election
We also have a 'pirate party'. According to [wikipedia] they support "reform of copyright law, the abolition of patents, and respect for privacy
" It maybe isn't that bad
Yes
But also no
The government we currently have is one of "national union". It does not actually represent any majority of votes, and as such can't do much except manage the covid19 crisis
That said, even though I didn't vote for them (I literally can't vote for our current prime minister since she's from wallonia), I (and many others) think they're doing a pretty good job
Unfortunately, racist isn't weird
We also have the pvda who are pro communism which is equally weird as VB in my opinion
Both those extremes are weird tbh
>Later it turned out he was clucking their main program (infinite life, free beer) in Morse and ASCII code
That's dedication
>Australia
Really big geographically, but tiny in terms of population at 25m.
It's just crazy to think that the small region of Benelux has more people than all of Australia and Mongolia combined
Belgium has 11 million
Norway is empty lol
Java is 4,5 times the size of Belgium
No, unless you count "first class", which is just a bit more quiet than the rest of the train
The only quiet coaches I have seen were on the Brussels - Brussels Airport - Antwerp - Den Haag/Amsterdam train, which is a Dutch train and the quiet part is only first class as well
We don’t have them, but I wish we had
When I still used trains to go to school, the only quiet zone you could find was in first class or on the toilet (depending on the age of the train)
And the modern ones (Siemens Desiro I believe) don’t even have a separation between first and second class
It’s just two small glass screens at the end of the carriage with eight slightly nicer seats behind them
I don’t get why you would still want to pay an extra fee for such a barely noticeable increase in comfort
Oh I wish we did
How lovely would taking the train or bus be if we had some sort of unspoken etiquette rule that made talking on public transport impolite
No more ladies shouting in their phones on the bus
One can dream, right
I looooove romanian trains
I get to travel in 1st class for 5 euro in the pocket of the train guy
I get to help give food deliveries at 2 am on nightrains
Watch videos with the train guy on his broken ass nokia phone
I love having 8 hours delay for a 40min route
Its just
wild
A higher chance of having a place to sit
That's the only reason you travel 1st class, nobody pays more to have some drawings on the walls
yeah no it was horrible, as a local
id avoid trains like the pest
for me
it was a life changing experience
Gent is the safest and chillest big city in belgium
You have a lot of youngsters and students and the atmosfere is very nice
Apart from some tourist attractions you can also go out very well and there are a lot of fancy second-hand shops
Yep definitely Ghent, really nice atmosphere, a lot of beautiful spots and a nice city centre
Less touristy than Bruges, so it's still a city where you can really live
I lived in Ghent during my Erasmus, I'll definitely stablish there if I got the chance
600 000 isn't small though
And you forgot : it got Killepitsch
What do you think of Neuß? Spent a holiday there with my gf, and visited Düsseldorf too
My sister sends me memes from there regularly even when her German isn't that good
Second image is hitler with Saint-Nicolas Bruh
Reminds me of r/BELGICA where they mix up Dutch, French and German
Ik see que du est ein homme de kultur
Best filter is to just avoid the places you know many Americans are going to be
That's really the best answer I can give
I can give you a little rant about this topic as well, If you like
Here it is:
r/all is simply a nightmare
Avoid it at all cost
I had so many blocked subreddits at one point that it might as well have been my own front page
Same with most subreddits that aren't specifically aimed at a non American audience
I think we should have a genuine debate about whether or not to make a few more subreddits aimed at a European (or simply not American) audience, because most of reddit is cognitively or culturally inaccessible to me as a European
r/askreddit is a perfect example, and there are many more
Despite the name, it's really just r/askAmericanRedditors
There's the assumption of all the commentators that everyone is American in there
Even when avoiding the obvious topics where you know most comments you won't be able to relate to, you still run into American exceptionalism constantly
"Oh what, you don't know these weird acronyms of US secondary school subjects
What did you think this was, a subreddit where we cater to a worldwide audience like our description says we do
Silly foreigner
We're Americans and we're the only ones with opinions that matter
I want a subreddit that's like r/askreddit (where you can ask anything), but specifically aimed at a non American audience
r/askeurope is specifically related to matters about Europe and the European way of life and thus doesn't fill that niche fully
I sometimes go to /all to pass some time, and looking at my RES subreddit filters here's what I filter out: MMA, nba, hockey, DestinyTheGame, baseball, and imsorryjon
So apparently US sports that I don't know anything about anyway, and two subreddits that annoyed me enough to add them
exactly the same
When i first got reddit hte first thing I did was unsub to all the default subreddits they subscribe you to because they were all annoying
Found my own niche(s) and I second not having browsed all, I literally have no idea how to get there
So we should start r/asknonUSreddit
edit: I just did
Pls use it
What are the most memorable single-day field trips you went on while in school
For example, me being a Belgian, I still remember going to the chocolate factory of Coté D'or, visiting the Caves of Han and its wildlife park, driving around in the harbor of Antwerp, cycling the Vredesroute (peace route) in Ypres and visiting Fort Breendonk
Canterbury
We left our school at 8 am and got back around 8 pm
We were only in Canterbury for like 5-6 hours but it was an amazing day, probably because I had never been in England and was looking forward to that moment for years
We went to Lille once for a day
It was kinda scary because nobody speaks french well when they are 15
and there was some kind of protest and some of our schoolmates got caught up in it and had tear gas thrown at them
We went to [Xanten (Germany)] twice (During my first year of Latin, and the year after again for history when I changed courses)
Very cool stuff, seeing a lot of Roman leftovers so close to home
Fort Breendonk was also very impressive
The WWI things we did were rather underwhelming (except for the huge cemeteries)
Other schooltrips for like geography were very local and lame
"This is the highest point in the area", standing on a random rolling terrain element, 38m above sea level lmao)
I biked over it a million times to go to school, never noticed any elevation lol
1) Going to the holding camps of WW2
Torture chambers and all that
Some harrowing stories
2) We went to London
It was around midnight and our hotel had a limousine driver just sitting there
We walked up to him and went for a ride
10 kids all paying 20 pounds
We drank some champagne and such while driving through center London, to the London eye where we took a group picture, etc
3) Having a good drink around a campfire at night on a beach in Barcelona
Remember taking some glass of a girl when she's had enough and all that
2) and 3) weren't endorsed by teachers or the like
Just something we came up with
Good times
I don't think I really have one that sticks out
So here's the list of what I still remember:
We once went on a very sunny day to Ghent, to the Gravensteen (medieval castle) and afterwards to the Blaarmeersen (lake with beach)
It was a really enjoyable day
One day I want to visit the Gravensteen again, because I can't remember anything except for the fact that I thought it was cool/interesting
We also once went to [P]  (zoo) and  Bellewaerde (amusement park)
I also once went to Boudewijn Seapart (Seapark + amusement park) but I didn't really like it
I also remember it was very rainy, so that might have influenced the fun
In high school we had a 1 day trip to Canterburry, which was really fun and exhausting (we left at 5am and were back home probably at 3 am the next day) Also in high school a 1 day trip to Lille
These trips to Canterburry and Lille were mainly fun because you had the freedom to run around, exploring with a few friends without the teachers (and you had to run all over the place to answer certain questions)
I also went to Paris twice, once I visited everything in group
The next time I just hung around with a couple of friends, sunbathing in le Jardin des Tuileries
As a Belgian of course I went to Ypres, I feel like most Belgians had a school trip to Ypres at some point during their high school years
I went to visit Archeon, a historical park in the Netherlands (roman times, medieval times)
I just remember that there were people walking around in Roman attire and their was a reconstructed bath house
I wonder if I ever went to Bokrijk (historical park in Belgium)
I can't remember it, but I can't imagine that we would have never gone there with school
I'm pretty sure I did  Fort Breendonk  at some point, but I don't really have memories of when or how it was
A trip to Brussels, I really only remember visiting the Royal Museum for Central Africa and the The Royal Greenhouses of Laeken
I also really enjoyed the sports day where we did la descente de la Lesse (kayaking down the river Lesse)
I had done it once before and once after that too
And it's definitely not the last time I'm doing that in my life
During a sunny day it's really a fun and chill activity to do with some family/friends
Edit: added a few things
Côte D'or and Breendonk are there too
My memories from that era are too fuzzy to remember which field-trips were with school or with summer "camps", or which ones were from "classe vertes" or single day trips
We made a little leather wallet/purse in elementary school: I collected flippo’s/beyblade’s in it for over 6 years
Good memories in Bokrijk (& the playground next to it)
As a Belgian I also went to Archeon
I'm actually from the region close to the border with France, so it was super far (probably 2:30-3 hours in the bus) and I get car sick easily, it was horrible
But Archeon itself, eventhough I don't remember much about it except for the people dressed up as Romans and the Roman bath house, I do remember really enjoying it
School (at the age of 11, 14 and 18)
School for me
Teachers thought it trough informative videos and explanation .
We get a sex education at school
I also have an older sister who showed me her condom stash and told me to take them whenever I needed them
In primary class ages 10-11, it was done by our class teacher
In my secundary catholic school, it fell upon the biology/science teacher every two or so years with standard biology videos
These were the exact same they used in the 80's, but in hindsight they were very clear and honest in the information
There were also additional courses by an organisation which specializes in sex ed (Sensoa)
They would bring in games and visual aides to help get the message across, and they have sessions with students to discuss their attitudes towards sex, and to answer questions which may be too embarassing to ask your teacher
Fun fact, I actually volunteered for the organisation while in med school to have a sessions with kids in a secundary school
It was actually loads of fun
We helped clear up some misconceptions many kids had, and they really liked asking questions
5th, 7th and 8th grade
From basic questions to how periods work, fertility, hormonal and non-hormonal birth control, etc
They give it in school  ( when you are 11/12, 13/14 and the more biologic stuff 17/18) but sometimes parents do also ‘ the talk’ . And we have several good websites which are not porn, just educational
Similar to Belgium in that case but that's for age 13-14
In that year in biology we basically go over all "systems" in the body(digestion, blood, urine, lungs and yes, reproduction)
A part of a viaduct in Brussels was dismantled and rebuilt in Bangkok as a gift from the Belgian government where it is now called the Thai-Belgian Bridge
Thailand also has a similar friendship bridge from Japan
I think it's a cool form of diplomacy, to build something that is actually useful for another country (free of charge) is a powerful sign in my opinion
Hey, we also dance the Polonaise
We always danced on it on school when it's our local festival
I am half Luxembourgish - half Italian (from Sicily and Umbria) with a French and Belgian nationality
Living in Belgium, I identify myself as a Belgian with Italian roots most of the time and even if I feel close to the French through culture, I don't say I am French except when I am asked about my two nationalities
I don't speak Italian ( i'm still in process of learning it ) but I can understand it, because I haven't been totally cut off from my Sicilian origins, where I visit my family usually every year for two months and where I can still draw on some cultural references
I'm half Flemish and half Dutch
I identify with Belgium the most because i live there, but i also identify with the Netherlands, just not as much
i'm dutch but parents moved to belgium
im kinda considered a foreigner on both sides now
An opera in 1830, “La muette de Portici”, led to riots breaking out in Brussels that night and, eventually, the Independence of the Kingdom of Belgium
That we opened the sluises of Nieuwpoort during the beginning of WWI so everything was under water and the Germans couldn't go through
Then they were all stuck there for 4 years
'Native English speakers never say just "Yes" or "No". They always say "Yes, it is", "No, it isn't", "Yes, I would" and so on
The greatest lie ever told
Also, do French speakers ever say tu or nous
I feel like it's always vous and on, but I am not sure
We were thaught that there were 3 ways of asking questions in French:
*Intonation*: "tu viens
" (Basically a normal sentence but your voice goes up at the end to indicate it's a question)
*Est-ce que*: "Est-ce que tu viens
And *Inversion*: "Viens-tu
We could usually choose which kind we used, so everyone always used the one with intonation because it's the easiest
You just make a normal sentence and put a '?' at the end
It turns out (from what I've heard at least) that that is never used
Even the 'est-ce que' one is rarely used
Of course the hardest one, 'inversion', is used almost every time
Edit: I'm stupid
Inversion is almost never used, the other 2 are
I also remember learning this, although only the older English teachers thaught this
I am very sure it is spelled: J'sais pas
This is how it would be written in comics
In Dutch, it is always inversion :)
I always say qu'est ce que in French
Huh well now I'm happy but confused
I swear someone told me that
But good to know
In Dutch, the intonation thing is mostly used when you're surprised
Like where you'd react with 'Really
So for example:
"Je bent blij" = You are happy
"Ben je blij
" = Are you happy
"Je bent blij
" (With the emphasis on 'blij') means more like "Are you *really* happy
With that
How
Maybe it was someone from Quebec who told me that it is used then
The reason I found it the hardest is because with the other 2, you can just keep your regular sentence structure from when you don't ask questions
With inversion, you need to change the order of the words
So it was still the hardest, even though we also use inversion in Dutch
I like the dutch names but i like the french names even more
I also like the Dutch and French names
I don't like the English names like Brussels, Antwerp and Bruges, etc
I think it's nice that you can clearly see etymology in the Dutch names, like the suffixes -zele, -ingen, -gem, ... that give a view of the history of the place
I'm sure that's also visible in a lot of French names, but I'm not familiar with the etymology there
I also think the original Dutch names are better then the French for the regions around the language border
For example Zittert-Lummen > Zétrud-Lumay
Same goes for Dutch
Okay I can’t for the life of me figure out what the last two are supposed to be, pls help
Oh hahah wauw ik had ze gewoon luidop moeten zeggen dus
With 376/km² population density (vs 33/km² in USA), it is a bit hard to have a middle of nowhere in Belgium
In most cases, just walk a couple kilometers, and you'll find a village, or a house, or a town/city/municipality
However, the least densely populated area of the country is the [province of Luxembourg] and as well the most beautiful part of the country
My village literally has the nickname "outside of the world"
Well technically there are no 'middle of nowheres' in belgium
But every region has its redneck zone
Near leuven everything in the middle of triangle Aarschot-Diest-Tienen is called 'de marginalen driehoek' (marginal triangle, let's say a redneck area)
If you are from antwerp city, you consider everything which is not the city or a posh neighbourhood 'the parking'.
In the far west corner of westflanders (westhoek) is an  area called 'bachten de kupe' (behind the tub), it got it's name from ww1 where the whole area was intentionally flooded (hence kupe or tub)
Some parts of the [Westhoek] (province of West-Flanders) are also sparsely populated compared to other parts of Flanders/Belgium
It's like the time stood still in these villages, which makes it nice to walk/drive through
More than the province in it'self, you could point to the Ardenne since some part are really remote
I wouldn’t call it the most beautiful though (Bruges, Ghent etc
You are kidding right
Have you ever been in the province of Luxembourg or in the Ardennes
Landscapes and nature around Flemish cities are boring : flatlands, farmlands, and sometimes some small woods
I'm not talking about cities here
The province of Luxembourg, and the Ardennes, have the more beautiful landscapes and nature, rivers, cliffs, hills, forests
But even when it comes to cities, it has beautiful places that Flanders doesn't have, such as :
[Durbuy]
[La Roche-en-Ardenne]
[Bouillon] and its [castle]
And plenty of nice little towns and villages of the kind
If we open ourselves to the rest of the Ardennes and some parts of the Condroz, and not just Luxembourg you have as well :
[Dinant] Which is one of the most beautiful part of the country as a whole
Or you have as well Han-sur-Lesse near Rochefort, its caves and animal park
Flanders and its cities is the mainstream part for tourism, the one overexposed
But when it comes to nature, cuisine/gastronomy, picturesque towns that aren't overcrowded and were people are friendly, this is in Wallonia that you must go, south of the Sillon Sambre-et-Meuse
First of all, opinions can be different and yes I’ve been to all those places
I prefer alive and medieval cities with beautiful goth architecture
You might not like it, but at the end of the day; there is a reason why the northern part of the country has way more tourists
No one goes to Belgium for its relatively mediocre nature or dead southern cities, let’s face it
Also, Flanders is not friendly
This is just ridiculous and untrue, where the hell did you get that from
but most importantly, you’re going to act like these UNESCO’s world heritage cities are not picturesque
[Ghent ]
[Bruges, aka the Venice of the North]
These cities (and more so Bruges, but that obviously depends on the person) are often given the title of ‘the most beautiful’, so there must be some truth to it
You can bore yourself to sleep in those cities as much as you like, but for me and many others, beauty lies in the way a city comes alive and offers plenty of ways to take in its rich (!) culture
You were correct when you said it was the “middle of nowhere” in Belgium, but beauty is a subjective concept and I gave my personal opinion on the matter
In Belgium (especially north and center) towns are small cities and cities are big towns
Usually young people and those without kids go for appartements, those with kids usually go for a house with a backyard
I can't imagine there is a lot of difference between the 2 over here
Smaller towns are just a connection between bigger towns and the max distance you can be away form a big city is maybe 20 minutes
So you can live in a small town and be 20 minutes away from our biggest cities
Our geography teacher back in 11th grade once told a story about when he met his Chinese girlfriend in China
He told her he lived on the "country side". She's packing batteries and such but he meant he lived longer than 5 minutes from an inner city church
(he uses a bike to get to the city center of Ghent to teach so it's not exactly far from that either)
In most of Belgium, cities don't end the way they do for instance in the USA
The only way to know in Belgium when you are leaving one town is when there is a sign saying you have arrived in another town
The area between Brussels, Leuven, Antwerp and Ghent is called the Flemish diamond, because it is very urbanised, has a dense road network and you can almost never get more 10km from a town, and i think 10 is a lot
Our disastrous build policy doesn't help with that
yes, scandinavia is literally a breath of fresh air
I love visiting the northern countries
that is also a very impressive bicycle trip
Belgians live relatively large and poor town planning lead to all the connecting roads to be built shut too
That's why there is almost no free space in Flanders
In Wallonia the terrain makes it less dramatic and in the Netherlands they did do town planning properly
But lots of people need lots of homes ofcourse
In  Belgium very unpopular
Cycling and football are the main sports
Endurance on the cobbles
Hard and fun to watch
Isn't the entire cycling season going to be done over the next few months
Like even TdF and all big ones one after another
It's going to be curious which big shots will ride which races
It's a nice one though
When the package of milk is opened we keep it in the fridge but you can cool the bottle before drinking it as well if you like
We don't refrigerate raw eggs
Neither go in the fridge here
(milk when unopened, stays good for weeks, obviously goes in the fridge after it's opened)
/raise shoulders
I don't like cold milk unlike some here
It's mostly used for cereals for me
Eggs never go in the fridge, and milk only goes in once opened, or to chill before drinking
For storage milk generally stays in a storage cabinet, but not in a fridge
I never store these in the fridge unless they are sold in the fridge
(Eggs are somethings sold in the fridge and sometimes they aren't, depends what supermarket I go to
Milk is never sold in the fridge here, so I store it out of the fridge
When I open the milk, I put it in the fridge, obviously
Milk is the same
Eggs you buy unrefrigerated but once at home most people put them in the fridge
Milk is usually bought in a pack
The bottle we use goes in the fridge, the rest of the pack in the basement
Eggs always in the fridge
The tray is actually not so great since it's in the door (at least in my country it comes in the door)
Eggs are very sensitive to changes in temperature
When you open the fridge a lot and the eggs are at a tray in the door, they undergo a lot of different temperatures
If you store eggs in the fridge, don't do it in the door
In Belgium too, UHT is what most people would buy and use without even thinking about it
It's interesting to see what the [markets in different countries] look like
For Italian and Asian places, this is a well ingrained custom, but for other restaurants it isn't really that popular
They were promoting it a few years back with the cringy "restorestje" campaign, but not much has changed IMO
Portion sizes in most restaurants aren't excessive, so usually there is very little in the way of leftovers to be able to take with you anyway
I get the impression that in Germany it's more like 'this is the rule, and it is a good rule because it makes sense, and you should feel good if you follow the rules'.
Whereas the UK it's more like 'doing this will make me look upper class, so that's what I should do
Don't want to look like those lower class plebs'.
I feel like Belgium is somewhat in between, more like 'I will do the most sensible thing, as long as I still look middle class'. So we definitely have 'wrong' supermarkets (where it's embarrassing if you shop there, because you would look poor)
So you only go there once in a while to stock up on non-perishable food
But the rest of the time, you go to the 'right' stores, where you just buy a few items though
AZERTY
In Belgium we use AZERTY
And there are no special keys for letters like ë, ä, ö, ß, á, ... because we don't use that in Dutch except in some rare situations
Belgian AZERTY but I can programmatically switch it to QWERTY, mostly for when I'm gaming
The superior [Belgian AZERTY] which allows you to make these : *éèàùäëüïöÿâêûîôÂÊÛÎÔÄËÜÏÖ* easily, but as well *áúýíóìòÁÉÝÚÍÓÀÈÙÌÒ*, unlike the French AZERTY which is inferior to ours since French people have difficulties writting capital letters with the ´and ` accents/diacritics, or using said diacritics on *yuio* freely
We can as well make the *ñÑ* easily if wanting to write in Spanish
In summary, Belgian AZERTY is more practical to write French than the AZERTY they have in France, which is kinda ironic
Other characteristics are : the , is where the M is on QWERTY keyboards, and the M is next to L. we have as well the *ç* "letter", but unfortunatly we can't make its capital version aside from using the ALT+128 code
Really a superior keyboard layout to QWERTY and its very limited set of letters/diacritics
Unfortunatly, too many softwares and games developers ignore this better layout
Don't forget to precise that Belgian AZERTY and French AZERTY are different
My work pc is Azerty, but the rest is qwertz
I use azerty but I secretly prefer qwerty
Yup AZERTY, though unfortunately when writing a language like Chinese and using the pinyin input method, the keyboard changes to QWERTY (of couse not the letters on the button, just the function)
It is quite annoying to go back and forth between QWERTY and AZERTY because after a time I start to confuse them
It's also really annoying having to type punctuation marks in QWERTY while looking at an AZERTY keyboard
I just use the full stop from the number pad, but to get something else I always need to try some out before I hit the right one
You French fucks really fucked us Belgian gamers over
I worked at Switch (Easy-M back then) for about a year
We had quite a large stock of laptops and keyboards
In my memory we had about 80-90% azerty, with the rest mostly qwerty and one or two qwertz that didn't get sold
Our branch was kind of the de facto central stock, tech repair center and B2B, so we had a lot of overstock from other stores too
But being the B2B go-to for techies and pro's we had quite a stock of these programmer layouts that were qwerty, I believe it was the [Apple International English] layout
I think I sold about a handful of these in a year with iMacs
Makes me want to switch to international qwerty now, being a programmer today myself
Cmd + Shift + ( GANG
Had some Dutch classmates in my Uni in Belgium
They got frustrated using the library computers because of the AZERTY keyboard
In group work they made me type everything if we did it in school
Yeah true
I think we use the exact same AZERTY except that the French one has more text on it on some keys, whereas we just use symbols for those keys
AZERTY is better than QWERTY though
I would say the first French republic was quite close to pre-Christian Roman Empire/Republic
The French revolution has Greco-Roman Pagan heritage written all over it
The Cult of Reason was basically worshipping Athena/Minerva
I want you to battle /u/Rovanasa_Hill as to make out whether it's Vatican City or San Marino who has more claim to the heritage
Indeed, Napoléon ruined everything and destroyed the revolution and first republic
Meanwhile, in Belgium, everyone closes their curtains at sunset
My mom does this and I'm just thinking; "why would you want to shut out daylight while it lasts
I think you found a real-life exploit, my friend
Blame Christianity
If you are a Christian, it's a sin to work on God's rest day
ptdr magl
amazing, I almost wooshed
'k zien aa gère
Not as common as
"Euj geil mokke
Its the Flemish way of saying it
In NL Dutch, u is mostly formal
But saying “ik zie jou graag” just sounds weird/forced to me
Where I live its “kzien aa geire”. Where the aa is u.
In this sentence it's meant informal
I have never used the words "je" or "jij" in my life  - which are the proper informal words - when speaking to someone . Always used "ge" or "gij". But it's something Dutch people don't do
There is quite a shift in use of words below or above the Rhine actually
Affirmative
Belgium has a lot of very strong dialects, this is the Antwerp dialect which has a lot of French influences, because we are a trilingual country
That's too high brow for me
There not much difference between the languages
They're in essence the same
But there are a huge amount of small differences
Then again, there are equal amount of small difference between local dialects as well
To the point where some Flemings are more comfortable in understanding Dutch dialects compared to, let's say, a Bruges dialect
Last elections in Belgium were a disaster
They put all the winning parties ‘off side’ and created an alliance with the losing parties to keep their posts instead of passing them on to the winning parties
Now we have no goverment for about 4 months again and this isn’t the first time that this happens
No government for about 4 months
The previous government resigned over a year ago
We’re almost hitting that record again
And they don't want to held new elections because it would be even worse than
What do you mean the winning 'parties'? N-VA was the real winner and they are part of the coalition
The other party that won votes in the election was VB but you didn't seriously think that anyone would form a coalition with the Fascists, did you
The way to form a government in case you aren't aware is to represent over 50% of the people
A combination of smaller parties is as representative as 2 or 3 bigger parties
I don’t keep track of it, was a rough guess
Jup, r/belgica
Don’t overestimate the regional governments, they can still only decide on topics that were assigned to them
The residual power is for the federal government
And how do you expect Belgium to keep existing as a country if the regional governments have to do everything instead of the federal government
The federal government is responsible for finances of the country, the army, the justice system, social security etc
And don’t worry, at this point I honestly don’t see it keeping existence either
Its kind of a mix here
Lots of people like a tan, but not having one isnt considered unheqlthy
Some people just dont tan (they just burn)
I myself tend to be fairly pale (blue eyes too) but I do tan fairly if I wear sunscreen
No sunscreen= burn
I’m ginger, and yes most people tend to think i’m british while on holyday, (i speek english with a brittish-ish accent, am ginger, burn like a petrol fumes and rarely get a tan (this year was the first year of me getting a light tan, without changing skin right after
Accents are very thick in Flanders, and have some connotations, people from West-Flanders are seen as farmers (also they can’t pronounce the g for some reason), people with an Antwerp accent are seen as cocky assholes, and people from Limburg are seen as dumb, because they speak very slowly
Accents from Limburg and Western Flemish are meme material
The last one usually gets subtitles as well
West-Flemish, then you're a bit of a backwards farmer
Limburgs, kinda funny because they speak somewhat slow
Is there anything that gets said about Vlaams-Brabant actually
I feel like in Flanders it's rare to encounter someone that *doesn't* have an accent (except on tv)
Gerrit Callewaert intensifies
We're the normal ones
Not really
I do it occasionally and I don't give a fuck if people find it weird
Yes, except when it's a real cheap resto or fastfood
But nobody really cares
No, because bail our bounties in general are non-existent
There can be some sort of reward if you have a tip for the police, but you will never be allowed to apprehend/arrest someone
we don't, cause that's fucking mental
I was surprised my French SO never ate canned halved peaches filled with a tuna-mayo mix
Apparently it's typically Belgian
Also paling in 't groen, Gentse waterzooi and vol-au-vent
Snert with pieces of smoked sausage and baked bread is the best winter meal
Yeah, but zuurvlees is beef I think
Haven't had that in a long time
Just a bit too sour for my preference
That could be true yeah
Not that much horse meat is being used these days
Mainly some regional sausages and charcuterie that I know of use it still
13 but actually more
a total of 50 bellfrys spread arround the whole country and parts of France are grouped as a single world heritage site
13, including La Grand place de Bruxelles, one of if not the most beautiful city center in the world !
We have 13, but our beer culture is considered immaterial world heritage, which is pretty cool
Didn't know about that
Dang, that's quite a lot for our small ass country
Belgians definitely know what the Wadden Sea is
Especially the Flemish and we account for 2⁄3 of the population
People who say lange hamburger deserve to get drowned in the Maas
Some people think that a [frikandel] is called a 'curryworst' (despite not containing any curry), and in the far east there are even people who call it a 'lange hamburger' (= long hamburger)
I agree
I'm from W-Vl and everyone is calling a  frikandel ( just like your picture) a frikandel, obviously it is the best name for it
Was looking for this comment
Curryworst for the win
Ne frikandel is een balleke
I'm not a native French speaker so I probably have no say in this debate, but just for some extra fun:
**Couque au chocolat
Fuck that shit
I call it "een glacéke" and love it to bits, but eating it
And then there's my grandma, who always goes "that's too big, you should cut it in two and share it" before exploding custard everywhere
Curryworst the and only correct word
Frikandel is voor dirty Hollanders
Frikadel is a meatball
Frikandel is a curryworst
Tzijn enkel de Limburgers die dat zeggen hoor, wie anders
How dare you
Haha in mijn dialect zeggen we enkel frikadel, misschien daarom ;) de eind -n wordt hier niet uitgesproken
Have heard that, too
I do not agree
It has no spine thus can't be a book
No no not Münster, anything but Münster, please
I spent a week in that region and Münster was all I got to eat and all I smelt the entire goddamn time
Honestly, I like the -ium at the end more than the Dutch "België" or the French "Belgique" or the German "Belgien".
Belgium is good
Belgica, no real reason but it just sounds epic to me
Braveland, in reference to Caesar's quote
Or Atomium, in reference to our monument, and to keep the quite unique  -ium ending
Or Beerland, because we are the only country with decent beer
Lol we already have  3 names for Belgium so I don't really care honestly
België / Belgique / Belgien
Any name would be less of a profanity compared to "Belgium"
In older Dutch we called it Hispanje, but for some reason it's just Spanje now
[I mean
In Dutch we call it Polen, but we use the same word for poles (as in the north and south pole), so I don't think it's a good name either
Belgica is even better imo
But I agree, the English name sounds better than the Dutch, French and German one
Why not change it to flemish ;)
No, Czechia doesn't have the variety and diversity Belgium has
All Czechia has is pils
Sorry, but German beers are so light that they are more like lemonade for grown-ups
Gaylord
Kevin
It's such a whitetrash name in my country
I love Saoirse as a name
But I know I would burden a child with everyone just pronouncing it wrong etc
Same
I really love Saoirse
But if I would have a daughter, it would be a burden, not a name
So what name did you end up picking
I personally try to avoid because I think it's trashy, but a lot of people absolutely do (though I must admit Supreme is not that big of a thing here)
I think people try to avoid overly obnoxious or large logos but not just logos as a whole
[This] is what most of my t-shirts more or less look like
I walk into some clothing store, grab a few t-shirts with nothing too much on it every few years
France
Now they are just a country filled with bad middle lane drivers in my eyes
Even worse than here
I used to be fascinated by Germany, I learned the language, read a lot about the history (pre 20th century tho) and even listen to the traditional music (I still love German folk music)
But then I met them and I thought they were the most boring, bland people ever
Still today I'm still heartbroken about that and no German I met since helped change that
Well at least it's according to classical tradition
I remember reading an ancient Greek text somewhere and the author was also complaining that, apart from a few monuments, Athens was just ugly, overcrowded and unorganised
Interesting argument but you can also look to this through a different lens and reverse this argument
If we other European countries make the international news it's usually not a good look either
Quite the contrary: at worst news reports from other countries often miss out on important nuances of local culture, or even is influenced by prejudice against them, or in the best case, get a clearer and less biased outside view on things by not being influenced by nationalism or emotions
Either way, it doesn't really present a prettier picture
I find it a bit weird to say that because we are more often confronted with a UK point of view we have more anti-UK bias
A much more simple explanation is that the nationalistic reasons for Brexit don't work on us and that therefore it's only logical that we are no big fans of Brexit (never mind all the antagonistic rhethoric against us and us getting poorer too)
I'm not taking any sides, I'm just saying that it makes sense from both viewpoints and that you can save your grievances about anti-UK bias because of language specifically, if anything this grants you a disproportionally big cultural and political sphere of influence
Still better than paying 100´s of euros payage
When driving on the E17 the ones in the middle lane going 100 are usually 30 year old Peugots with an F on the back
Nice troll
For Dutch:
In general (but lots of exceptions exist, and families have moved between countries in the past): the Netherlands will not capitalize 'de' or 'van', but Belgium will use 'De' and 'Van'.
There were also some funny guys who chose dumb names like Pannekoek (pancake)
Not that funny now hey
FYI
Van België is used as their surname sometimes, but their actual surname is van Saksen-Coburg en Gotha
My favorite dutch last name is "pissman"(pee man)
Costumer of ours
It's a pretty easy language overall and quite closely related to my own (Dutch) so it could have been worse I guess
Yeah, I think I do
More so the cultural dominance of the US than the language itself though
And it is a bit disheartening that for communication with my countrymen to be effective a foreign language seems to be the best option by far
No, I’m quite happy that there is a language most people speak that is not so hard to learn
Only in the sense that a lot of our culture is being anglicized
I think it's great that there is a lingua franca, but it does get kind of annoying when people's start mixing English and Dutch (or even worse, French) in their daily language
It feels like the Lingua Franca of the world sometimes and I think that’s a great thing
Especially as someone who’s from Belgium, where we have three different language communities struggling to understand eachother
Not really i do wish there was more stuff in other languages that could help me learn them i also don't like how americans in particular do not understand things that are not common in their country like the metric system or minor cultural things
Luxembourg:if they rise the fuel price
The netherlands:their accent hurt a lot
France: their national football team
Germany:no
I think we ourselves are the biggest threat to our own country
Can you explain
Oh shit you know about it, i mean we would never do something like this
Hockey is a brutal game
Your could be afraid from your financial situation
And we would keep it like this(in real life the north and south are best friends but we act like we don't like each other so the neighbours don't come suspicious)
Maybe they give  us obesity with bratwurst and liquorice
So that means war
You guys love our accent though
Most Dutch people I've spoken to think our accent is cute
Nah that record got broken by northern ireland
You also work very close with the belgians right
Do they sometimes jam your radars
That is becaus we are dedicated to our act(where is the oscar)
And who are you
You do it also with canada and mexico
And you half of our tax money
Ögedei's mongol invasion went as deep as Czechia, Austria, and Croatia so they didn't really care too much about having to cross some mountains to fuck someone's day up
Commonwealth time
Interesting ,but what i never understood is why, russia is big enough an europe is not gonna attack russia for more land
That's funny because it's true
If we get it from carice van houten
The russians even touching belgian airspace
Yeah delete the comment about the mexicans so our russian friend can make the joke
[Well, their aircraft did
Their pilot did not
An attack on norway is it difficult,a conflict between norway and russia is it financialy a big cost for russia(becaus i read an attack on ukrain will cost a lot of money)
Yep, knowing he lived quite rural
What are the odds
We have a small German community also dialects are dying here
I speak a tiny bit of walloon thanks to my grandparents
Over here all 3 regional languages are official ones so German doesn't really count I think
I speak a West Flemish dialect though and the other regions joke/act like it might as well be a separate language
I speak Dutch, the ‘majority’ language in Belgium, but I prefer speaking West-Flemish
Which can be considered to be a language on it’s own as it’s a strange combination of Flemish and French
Around 1 million people speak it in Flanders, 80
000 in France and 30
000 in The Netherlands
Isnt it because of some French policy that tries to get French to be the main/only language spoken, for some sort of closer feel of unity
The Flemish minority around Dunkirk is also getting smaller and smaller
Not really i think, the difference is just the accent and some words, a bit like the difference between the French in Paris and in the south of france or with the French in Belgium or Switzerland
I think wallon is dying its a sort of mixture between French German and flemish
You have something of 600k speakers and it will probably die in the 21th century
Here in flanders all of them in school we are forced to learn "algemeen nederlands" (common dutch) currently only the elderly still speak it
There are still 25% of the population who speak French in Canada
Thats just like, the entire West
Living in a country where history and a lot of scientific fields don't get studied because they're not profitable for the debt they cause doesn't sound attractive honestly
Many people from western europe still know little of their eastern european brothers and sisters
U've got Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya
Deserts with camels, going to own the sun energy market
Most I'd know would be Egyptian history because of movies and series, but I barely know anything about North African culture
Edit: missed Algeria, biggest country there lol
Do you consider countries like Nigeria North or Central Africa
I have a great deal of respect for Maghreb nations and feel a lot of kinship towards them
To me they feel as close as several fellow EU countries
I don't believe I have that much knowledge over them though
Not to say I'm without a clue either
The high days of the Bourgundy counts in their rule of the lower countries (14th, 15th century)
John the Bold; John the Fearless etc
A local historian did a popular podcast on his book about the Bourgundians and it has fascinated me ever since
1) Lots of political manoeuvring to get a first kind of unification in the areas of the low countries
Going against France one day, against England the other, and even contending with the Holy Roman Emperor and meanwhile frequent rebellions in Flanders itself (Ghent like 5 times over their rule)
2) Betrayal: at one point John the Fearless was betrayed by the French king and slaughtered on a bridge
3) They had lavish lifestyles and parties (hence the term Bourgundian lifestyle), which would be amazing to see in life
4) Lots of the cities still have a lot of the landmarks
5) Several strong female players, like Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut and Margaret III, Countess of Flanders
The First World War I know it’s very hard to make an AC game in a World War but there are so many historic events that happened then in our country and many of the old cities like Ghent look exactly the same now like in that time with many old buildings and they are some of the most beautiful cities in the world
Four options: -Roman times (to get Ambiorix some fame)
\-Burgundian times
\-Under the Spanish
\-Belgian revolution
The ancient Rome one seems very plausible after the last three games
WW2 AC isn't really compatible with the RPG turn AC has taken
But adding in a tonne of Roman gear, political intrigue (Templar emperors
), aggressive expansion, barbarian invasions, a vast and varied territory, gladiator fights
In fact I bet it's the next AC setting, or at least on the shortlist
Yessss
It would be awesome to see Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp, Louvain and more in an AC game
Curious though, what book/podcast are you referring to
Sounds interesting
De Bourgondiërs, Bart Van Loo
[Link to book]
You can find it on Spotify as a free podcast
It's probably the most well known English language Christmas movie
However, in the French-speaking part of the country, we tend to be more in line with France when it comes to movies
Therefore, the traditional Christmas movies would be "[Le père Noël est une ordure] or "[Les Bronzés font du ski]
Yes, every year
Doesn't miss

Margies (marginalen) in the North c:
We need to have someone from the German part to tell us about their terms
Probably Assi like the Germans xD
I'll be the stand in German c:
I speak French and Spanish
I can somewhat understand Portugese and Italian if it is written, I may not get things like idoms but I probably could understand the general meaning of the message
Understanding someone speaking either of these languages is a whole different story, though
It is disturbing because my brain would be like "Wtf is happening, it sounds familiar, I should be able to understand".
As for Romanian, I may be able to recognize some words but understanding the general meaning of the message may be more difficult than for Portugese and Italian
Very good
My grandma always goes on trips to Germany And it’s always fun to see her and the hotel owner talk in their own language (Dutch vs German) yet being able to have a perfect conversation
Dutch/Flemish native, can understand a decent amount of German but probably not as well without the exposure to it
Lot more similar than with Scandinavian languages though, the writings appear more alien in that regard
Although I’ve caught myself confused a few times when I heard a Scandinavian language spoken in my city and couldnt decipher if it were Flemish or something else for a few seconds
Swedish and NO, DK have a lot of words that are easy to remember because they are oddly similar sometimes
Icelandic is the one that seems the farthest removed, there is a word here and there that makes sense but other than that it’s more unique
Language families are pretty fun
Imo, German sounds a bit like Dutch from the middle ages in some ways, like a lesser evolved language
Show me your hands, I'll show you
We used the guillotine back in the days

Pretty common in Brussels and ''communes à facilités'' (communes on or near the bilingual border) but very rare elsewhere I think
In Flanders(Belgium, education is not a federal thing here) we learn french when we are 10-11 or so but sometimes even earlier
We learn english at age ~14
The kids who are better at school and in higher streams learn german at age 16 and the higherst stream learns Latin from age 13 i think, with a possebility of greek
Wallonia is different, they also learn a secondairy language, but they have to choose between english and dutch
which is a shame because they allways choose english
So the walloons cannot speack dutch most of the time
And when kn flanders they will NOT try speacking dutch, nor english they just assume we all know our french very well, which is very frustrating
That’s why the bilingual Brussels is more and more becoming “francophonic”(no idea if that’s a word)
In Uni we had a lot of English courses
I am now going for my second masters and it’s entirely in English
I think you can count bi/multilingual schools on one hand, however it is common at university level to have classes in English aswell
Pretty common
We learn Dutch, French, English and in later years German as well
Most school have at least Dutch, French and English as second language and in my school you had to take a second language (English, German or Dutch, from most chosen to least) then when you went in 5ft or 6th year you could take a third language (English, Dutch, German or Spanish, again from most chosen to least)
You also had the option of having immersion, where some subject would be taught in a different language, when i was in secondary it was English only in my school but another one from my town offered German immersion
At highschool only the language's classes were in that language (French; English; German)
Other classes were all in Dutch
In uni we had some semesters with English classes though
Well, it does exist
It is called 'Content and Language Integrated Learning".
My daughter has had biology, geography and informatics in English in a Flemish public secondary school
Catalonia, Basque, Galicia
The thing is, if Vlaams Belang and NVA win big next Flemish elections, they could try to split even if the majority of people disagree
The Independent Republic of California begs to differ
That'd be unconstitutional though, and doing something unconstitutional while a majority of the people disagree will fuck up lots
velocity and speed, which makes physics confusing
What the
Wegen = verb or plural
Singular for road is "weg".
Don't forget Flanders
I think that, at least for Dutch-speakers, it's pretty easy compared to others because the languages are very closely related
also:
> I’ve heard that over 90% of people in the Netherlands and over 85% of  people in Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark) can speak English
For the Netherlands at least it's not true
This was a test where Dutch people had to say of THEMSELF if they spoke good English, and in the same test like 80% said that they speak better English than the mayority of Dutch people
As for Dutch, I don't think school has anything to do with it
In Dutch Belgium the numbers are similar to the Netherlands, while in French Belgium they actually spend way more time studying English yet proficiency is remarkably lower
Furthermore, plenty of kids who haven't had a single class of English yet speak very simple English
I believe the following to be responsible:
- Dutch and English are extremely similar
English is one of the easiest languages to learn for Dutch speakers, and vice versa
- A lot of popular media is English, giving people a lot of exposure to the language
Children aquire languages especially well, and combined with an easy language and a lot of exposure, this could easily explain high English proficiency amongst Dutch speakers
For Flanders, Belgium:
- Small country, and Flemish alone doesn't get you very far
- Lots of influence of anglo culture
- We get English from 2nd year of secundary school
- No dubbing
- Lots of travelling, and people don't speak French or Dutch, English is you safest bet
Province (West-Flanders) , Flanders, European
Only Belgian when national team is playing
I identify first as Flemish
Then being from Antwerp (Antwerpenaar)
Then European
Then Belgian (although it only lives when the national football team is playing)
The dynamic between North and South is pretty different tho, you’ll find a lot more Belgians in Wallonia than in Flanders
I identify with my city first, then Flemish, then Belgian and then European
Watching tv and playing football
If my parents allowed me I was playing football outside, if not I was watching tv
That’s basically my youth
Shadow boxing but with a stick
I kicked a lot of imaginary ass back in my day
Literature sounds very strange
Littruh chur
I had to overcome some kind of mental block to say that word
"Rural" is also a terrible word
I can't pronounce "microtransactions" quickly
I have to distinctly split it in parts
For example: "Fuck this game and it's shitty micro - trans - actions"
However, I don't understand how some people can't pronounce "nuclear" and make it "nucular"
I've always hated the word champion, and championship
I remember being in second grade and just not being able to pronounce it
A classmate even laughed at me for that
Maybe that's why I still feel like I can't pronounce it
I can't think of a single word, I study in English, but "lord of the rings" just always comes out as "lororerings" :/
Rural is a terrible word
I just pronounce it "litrally"
Native English-speaker; I once made some Polish friends of mine repeat "Fred's threats fret threads". They made me talk about that bee in Szebśćenie or however it's spelt
Most Dutchmen pronounce dead, dad and that like the word debt
The English word "and" is usually pronounced without the D and the vowel is like uh
So it is pronounced like Dutch "een". Even the dictionary mentions this pronunciation
Good contender for hardest to spell
Quite funny, were talking about language and you're making a spelling mistake
It's vice versa :)
Why is it that when Dutch and German borrow words from French, they sound similar to French, whereas when English borrows a French word, the pronunciation gets put through a shredder
No problem
But please do not assume Belgians speak French :)
I've been in Cardiff for a night out
There was a culture shock
At 20h people were already shitfaced
At that hour, typical students in Belgium meet up to eat something ("fondke leggen")
It was as if everyone had to go home at midnight and thus had to binge as quickly as possible
Really weird
They are not really far, but no direct neighbors: Ireland and Austria
Both formerly very catholic with a bigger (and in Belgium's case two) condescending neighbor who speaks the same language
When Austrians complain about Germans, I totally get the feeling
And when I read stories about the crimes of the catholic church in Ireland, it makes me think how influential the church was over here
Also the gloomy weather
Swin, nature reserve
Basically on the border of Belgium and the Netherlands there is an area that's rather flat and during the flood gets flooded before going all the way back
It's a huge area with a huge amount of birds and such
Alternative, the "polders", again between Belgium and the Netherlands
A lot of small lakes, we went there on occasion to find eggs, swim, etc
Anything going South for me is the Flemish diamond
High density of people and industry so basically jack shit there
Not OP, but this is in Belgium, more specifically in the most eastward Flemish province, Limburg
On the same domain there's also a very cool open air museum, with old preserved buildings from all over Flanders, as well as a forest, an arboretum and really nice castle gardens
Certainly worth a visit if you ever come to Belgium
We use Blackboard Collaborate Ultra at university
Zoom is banned
What do you dislike about blackboard collaborate
My university uses BB collaborate ultra for every faculty (I think) and the professors at my faculty really like using it
I also like it, but I haven't used Zoom so I can't compare
In Belgium:
Reet = ass
Lulstraat = dick street
We have a place called 'the anal triangle' because there are 3 cities/towns with 'ass' in it:
Reet, which just means ass
Kontich, with kont meaning ass
Aartselaar, but you pronounce it as Aarselaar and aars also means ass
There are also Aarsele and Aarshot
We also have Bierbeek which means beer stream
We also have towns like Peer (pear) and Wortel (carrot)
And we have many more
In Belgium there is Buitenland
Meaning abroad in English
In Belgium, Trou-de-mon-cul (hole of my ass l, literally)
Also Cul d'Enfer (hell ass)
Historically, le Cul was the back of a field (or a small field)
Poepershoek would be "fucking corner" (fucking as in sex) for us Belgians
Also, Nottingham was called Snotingham, during the Anglo-Saxon period
I don't think that's Europe my good sir
Where is Lulstraat
Asking for a friend
there are many funny names of towns in France [see this map]
There are also Putte ( whore in french),Jambes (Legs), a bus stop "Couillet-Queue" ( "balls and dick"),Champion,Bouge(Move),the river la Haine (Hate),Bouillon(Broth),etc
In Mechelen you have the Befferstraat
I don't know anymore, it was a very tiny street without houses in Flanders
Do you mean in Bonheiden
On the Mechelsesteenweg
No the Befferstraat in Mechelen
It leads to the grote Markt
The one you are talking about is Befferhof and Befferdreef which are in Bonheiden right on the border with Mechelen though
Yeah, your right
Railway disaster in Buizingen would be on the list
The first one to spring to mind (perhaps due to it's relative recency) is the [Buizingen train crash] in 2010
Two fully loaded commuter trains entered in a head on collision in Brussels after one of the drivers had ignored a red light
The worst one however is probably the Marcinelle disaster, which happened in a coal mine called "Bois du Cazier" in Marcinelle, now part of UNESCO World Heritage
In 1956 an Italian mine worker tried to load a cart into one of the lift cages
What he didn't know was that that lift was actually headed towards another level
So while he was loading his cart into the cage, the lift moved upwards
This caused the telephone lines and two electrical cables to break of as well as the air and oil pipes of the lift
This then of course sparked an immense fire underground whose deadly gasses rapidly spread throughout the entire mine through it's ventilation system
The heat of the fire snapped the cables of the other lifts and soon the miners found themselves trapped with no means of escape or communication between the above and below
Of the 275 miners at work that day only 13 ever made it out alive
When the excavators finally reached the bottom of the mine well over a week later, they famously reported "Tutti cadaveri".

In the Heysel-Stadium 1985 39 people were killed because the stands collapsed
It's been the Champions League Final between Liverpool and Juventus
After that, the stadium was renamed and renewed
Not geographically in Germany but by a German with a German company: [deliberate crash of a Germanwings airplane] into the Alps, resulting in 150 fatalities
Or the bus with all the schoolkids that crashed in Switzerland - if found that it wasn’t suicide
People were killed because of confrontations between violent supporters
The collapsing stands are a consequence of the confrontation (English hooligans charging Italian stands)
The collapse isn't even the cause of most deaths
From your link:
> Contrary to reports at the time, and what is still assumed by many, the collapse of the wall did not cause the 39 deaths
Instead, the collapse relieved pressure and allowed fans to escape
Most died of suffocation after tripping or being crushed against the wall before the collapse

Usually one really knows anything about Belgium, except for that one Japanese man who, upon hearing where my friends and I had come from, said, "Oh, Congo
... I mean, really
Well either they don’t know the country or make a reference to WW 2
The worst one was when an American said to me: “that’s not even a country, stop making up places”. So that was kind of sad
When it comes up in a converstation with non-europeans, most often I get comments on Waffles
Which is weird to me, because waffles are not in the top 5 things I feel like people should associate with us
(I'd say Chocolate; Beer; Fries; Dysfunctional governments; Surrealism/absurdism)
The craziest part is that within the waffle people there's even two factions: you have the group (usually from non-anglo countries) who've had actual Belgian style waffles (Liège or Brussels style waffles); and you have the group who associate us with American "Belgian" waffles (usually from anglo-countries), which are definitely not Belgian
Yeah, either they know nothing and ask where it is or they'll name some cities like Anderlecht and Clubbrugge
Also EDEN HAZARD AND LUKAKU
But to be fair most know about Brussels and have a strong opinion on whether it is livable or not
It's either a cool place or hellhole overrun with Muslims
When I used to live in Molenbeek they would usually ask how dangerous it is, if I see many terrorists etc
Not yet, but there's still a chance it comes in February or March
No nothing
This week the temperature was stayed between -3°C - 3°C however but it didn't snow
No there is no snow in Belgium so far the last few years there was only snow at the end of the winter
It was semi popular in the past but now it has been replaced by online shopping
[The police officer pepperspraying protestors while eating a waffle]
[Walen go home] during the linguistic protests at the (then bilingual) Catholic University of Leuven in 1968
These protests did not only cause the university to split amongst linguistic lines but also set in motion the split of the Christian People's Party and led to the state reform of 1970, the first of many that would shape the federal structure of Belgium
[The construction of the Atomium] (1957)
As a fellow Belgian, I can confirm
I also like the foto of Queen Fabiola with an apple
Why would he lock his bike at the king's palace
This surely would be the last place his bike would get stolen
Some people don't age well
That could be from the Dutch hunger winter during WW2
Advantage: traveling and its really quit
TIL nearly 20% of people in Luxembourg are Portuguese

I wonder if you can go freely to the North part of the island and if it's a often recurrence to do so
Or the island is well separated and the two parts are hermetic to each other
Tbf, they could absolutely give an interesting answer tonthis question
Which would make their inhabitants only rarer, thus making it infinitely interesting
Faroese (sounds even nicer than Icelandic in my opinion) and eastern Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian)
Italian people talking about food, especially in documentaries like when they make olive oil and all
So melodic and passionate
Definetly Japanese
That double L is something else entirely though
I love how rare it is because I've never heard it in any other language
That's actually such a good description
I love the way it sounds though
I find it really nice sounding, can't really explain
It feels very "aerial" due to its pronounciation (while Icelandic feels more "breathy" in comparison)
Our first king, [Léopold I] was German
Otherwise, for prime ministers, [Charles Rogier] (one of our main revolutionaries) was from France
Not that I know of
The closest we got to that was Elio Di Rupo as prime minister
Son of Italian immigrants but the only one born in Belgium
He is also openly gay, and that got pretty much no attention
(Just like we currently have a trans woman minister without it being made a very big deal)
Belgium (Southern Netherlands) has had as sovereign: French (Burgundian) Dukes, (certain parts) French Kings, Spanish Kings, Austrian Archdukes and Emperors, a combo of an Austrian and Spanish Archduke and Archduchess, a French Emperor, a Dutch king, all before we settled with a German Prince who became King Leopold I of Belgium
Also: Prince-Bishopric of Liege has had multiple foreign Prince-Bishops
Since Belgium it’s been mostly cool, have been some French-born ministers but that’s about it
One of our ex prime ministers was born from Italian immigrants, Elio Di Rupo
Does it count
>one of our main revolutionaries
>from France
Well that explains why he was a revolutionary
Charles V was born in Belgium (and yes, we can use this name, all the Low Countries were called Belgica in Latin still during that time)
Léopold 1 was German, our first king
Charles Rogier, one of our first prime minister and major member of our revolution, was French
I totally forgot we had that trans woman as minister
Was a rather big deal internationally
Don't forget when we temporarily made a United Belgian States through revolution, before the French revolution even happened
The real copy cats are the French
Yeah, but that's not really fair is it
Belgium didn't exist prior to that
Exactly, nobody in Belgium cares and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way
What is more accepting than not giving a shit about the sexuality and/or gender of your politicians
We don't care if she is trans or Elio is gay
We only care if they do their jobs, or more accurately, if they don't.
Was it before the French Revolution
Both started in 1789
One of my law professors (and ex-minister) thought Cyprus was Malta and Kreta was Cyprus, and said that a few times in front of a lecture hall of +600 students until someone corrected him
It was funny though, and he could laugh with it
It sure did the stereotype that older people can’t do European geography not good
In classic architecture class we were talking about a house in the Netherlands and one student remarked how it's obvious where the house was build, because the outside was colored in red-white-blue, to which our teacher remarked 'Since when is there red in the Dutch flag
The Germans started ww1- my dutch and religion teacher
She also said the winter olympcs of 2018 i think it was where held in North Korea
Religion teacher, who nobody really took serious and had to fight constantly for control of the class
She used these fill-in booklets to structure here courses in different themes
One of which was about the role of science and religion
Basically, the point was religion operates on ethics, science operates on factual statements or something like that
But one small sentence in the booklet was in my mind a bit out of place
So I was one of the few paying attention to see how the teacher would clarify it
So she read the sentence: " Just like religion, scientists often use **symbolism**", and just moves on to the next part
So I raise my hand and asked if she could give an example
She became red, began to stammer a bit
The whole class was silently waiting for her giving an example
She eventually came up with " a sunset, the sun isn't really setting
" but nobody was convinced
She then apologized to me for not immediately finding anothe example and moved on with the course
I felt a bit bad
Edit: symbolism, not metaphors
So he was what ?
Vandelanotte
To be fair the aquaduct one had me in doubt for a second becuase technically he's not wrong
So many people don’t get this and it annoys me
There was a map
We were learning about the European Union and he included a map of Europe several times in his PowerPoint to show the expansion of the EU and other stuff
Yes
She wasn't my youngest teacher ever but she didn't seem THAT old
I think we all remember how the United Kingdom of the Netherlands worked out (or maybe not all of us)
To be fair it wasn't the brightest class
Some propably didn't even know what the Dutch flag looks like, some others like myself were trying to suppress our laugh
They still hear language
People who are deaf, however, maybe think in sign language, written language and moving lips
What about deaf and blind
Touch
Either way, animals indeed don't think in full sentences
But they probably have other ways to structure their thought, like images and feelings
That's true, she did however asked for the country and not a city
She is known to mix up stuff, nobody corrected her because it was  for some trivial pursuit style 2018 recap and the guys who got the point didn't win anyway
Italy sure did help the allies by trying to invade Greece
Retarded politician teaching law
There could only be the one lol
I know that her statement was wrong and she suggested it had another function than it  actually has
I just remarked that an aquaduct CAN sometimes span a river
Still not it's primary function though
In English you spell it as aqueduct
That just makes so little sense that I assumed the op misspelled it
In Dutch
And I assume there are other languages as well
It's a regional thing
Some towns have a strong Saint-Martin's day  (11 November) tradition, in others the kids go around with New Year
The door to door singing is still a thing if it wasn't for kovit
The gateau is big money, supermarkets and backers sell tons of them
That we may have winter blackouts again, due to our underfunded outdated overexpensive energysector
We have whole schedules detailing which provinces will get cut off from electricity at what times
In Belgium we had the news of a guy in his mid twenties that wanted to honour his deceased mother by litting fireworks
He accidentally lit his face up with the fireworks and passed away as well
Winter
In this time of the year
Unheard of
There is a poem by the flemish author Willem Elsschot called ‘Het Huwelijk’ (The Marriage)
It’s about an old man who is contemplating his life and his marriage
His wife is old and sickly and he fantasises about killing her and burning down the house, but he doesn’t act it out
That’s where these lines come in:
“Maar doodslaan deed hij niet, want tussen droom en daad
staan wetten in de weg en praktische bezwaren,
en ook weemoedigheid, die niemand kan verklaren,
en die des avonds komt, wanneer men slapen gaat
(My literal translation) “But he did not kill her, for in between a dream and a deed, there are laws that stand in the way, and practical issues, and a melancholy mood that no one can explain, that comes at night when we go to sleep”
The whole poem is a masterpiece of sparse but powerful imagery
The ending gives me goosebumps every time
Although I know some french speaking Belgian poets, I don't think a line of poetry from them really reached such status
However lines from French poets such as "Demain dès l'aube, à l'heure où blanchit la campagne" are better known
I don't know much about Flemish poets though, maybe someone from the Flemish region can elaborate on that ?
Most definitely a good choice
Most certainly one of the most beautiful in the (Dutch/) Flemish language
However
Most people would not have heard about this poem, as it is not widely known
Ask someone to recite a poem in dutch, and it is very well possible they well resort to Hieronymus van Alphen's "Jantje zag eens pruimen hangen" :
> Jantje zag eens pruimen hangen,
>o! als eieren zo groot
>'t Scheen, dat Jantje wou gaan plukken,
>schoon zijn vader 't hem verbood
(Little John saw prunes hanging from a tree, prunes as big as eggs
He wanted to take some, but his father told him not too
At least that is better than the (only) line of poetry this guy I know can recite in Dutch
>Vinde gaai maain gat nie te dik in deze rok
(do you think my a\*\* looks fat in this skirt
I can't really think of many foreign movies set in Belgium
The only one I can think of is 'In Bruges' which shows Bruges as a picturesque, touristy, historical city with shitty weather
So pretty accurate
The movie shows only one side of Brugge, the touristy side
The whole of Belgium is much more than a medieval city
Agreed
It was the centre of world trade for a while and they do brew "Straffe Hendrik" in Brugge, but there is more in Belgium
Much like Britain is much more than Buckingham Palace
France is much more than Champs Elysées
Spain much more than Ramblas
Say you prefer Dutch beer
Drink beer in another beers glass
Be careful with our beers
Some are quite heavy and will get you drunk in no time
Think that Flemish people and Walloons are the same
Its kind of the same like England and Scotland
We are two different types of people with our own culture
Put beer in the wrong glass, i'll make an exeption for pills but never put duvel in a crystal glass
Speaking French in Flanders ir Dutch in Wallonia
I would also add don't try to keep up the drinking with the locals
It depends where you are from, but its quite common to see Brits and other tourists lying passed out by 22h or puking in the gutters
Our beer has a bit more alcohol than in some other places
And don’t say fries are invented in France
Except for us
You'll always stay Hollanders for Belgians :-)
I didn’t know it was such a rude thing to ring your bell in the Netherlands
Here in Belgium I guess we’re somewhere in between on this
I’ve always learned to ring your bell when someone’s cycling in the middle of the cycling path so you can safely overtake them
However lately, more and more people seem to think you’re being rude
You can just feel them looking annoyed once you’ve overtaken them
Kinda depends on what you buy
We bought our kitchen there because many people we knew were extremely glad with theirs
Also, their customer service and warranty are a lot better than the alternatives
Food, cheap and a maze to walk trough
Good for people with a low budget like students and young couples, not so good in the long run
They have some innovative ideas that are now done by others aswell
(Powerless chargers and usb power outlets integrated into furniture, smart lamps etc
Over here I've seen it used by my sister when she went to study as well as my parents who make 300k'ish/year
Shoe cabinet, a fifth wardrobe(or something, not counting them), etc
I'm moving out somewhere next year and I'll be buying most of my stuff there because I'm cheap and with few exceptions don't care that much about quality
As long as my desk, chair and bed are higher quality the rest can be bottom of the barrel
I find it more disgusting how many Germans brag about them being good at war
Your such a chad good job
Both China and the US are in essence oligarchies though
More like American personel not taking responcibility for their criminal actions
Fries from a traditional ´frietkot´. Most fries outside of Belgium taste like paper
Forgetting about Belgian cheese, tsk tsk tsk
Chimay, Oude Brugge, Orval, Maredsous, Herve, Briquette de chèvre, te veel om op te noemen
Most Dutch chocolate is a joke though, with some notable exceptions
Mexican, no
I've also seen an Irish restaurant
Obviously the ones you mentioned are among the biggest of course
We use that as well
Can confirm
We use it in Dutch too
There is no real relation found between drinking hard water and kidney stones (thus far)
The only polish ''groceries'' that i know of where i live are in cheap stores (no offense) like in Traffic or Action and it's Fanta or Coca cola that comes from Poland, idk why though
Icelandic history
I find it crazy that they were their own country *before* they became part of Norway
Not a country but a specific region: Bourgogne
Ever since I visited the region and listened to this amazing podcast about it’s history (for all Dutch speaking people: De Bourgondiërs van Klara, te vinden op alle podcast kanalen) and read a book about it (De Bourgondiers of Bart Van Loo, recently translated in German) I’ve been absolutely fascinated by the region and its past
Russia and France
I don't know why, but they both have such a rich  history that has known some extremes
I just like Russia's architecture and such too
See you all in 400 years when sombody mentions us
Malta
For such a small blob on this globe, it has a fascinating series of events during its history
For me personally, it's because it's so rich
You guys have been through so fucking much
It's close to us Europeans, but also totally different
It's hard to describe
Added bonus: I love Russian architecture so there's that
I think a week in Ghent during the week of November 16th, 1949 could be interesting: [Battle of Gravensteen]
To 1830 when the Belgian Revolution happened and I want to see if my home city supported it or not
-All the way back to before the Indo-Europeans arrived
-Back to 2000 years ago when there were just Germanic and Celtic tribes
I would like to see what their life is like
I recognize the German one, the Russian one, the French one and the British one
I may know a few of the first words, but that's about it
Well, ever since our prime minister accidentally sang the first two phrases to the French national anthem I always sing that when they ask me to sing the Belgian one
I think most Belgians don’t even know the Belgian one
I know the French one (La Marseillaise)
I can sing along to the chorus and a big part of the first verse
Despite being a Dutch speaking (Flemish) Belgian, I can't even remember what the Dutch national anthem (het Wilhelmus) sounds like
I just listened to it, and I'm sorry to say this, but I understand why I don't even remember it
It's a bit boring, it reminds me of those slow church songs
I also don't like the lyrics
I can sing along to the 'chorus' of the English/British national anthem 'God Save the Queen'.
I would recognize the beginning of the German national anthem 'Das Deutschlandlied'. But then again it starts with 'Deutschland, Deutschland, über alles
' (Germany, Germany above all
) So that would be difficult not to recognize
I didn't know the national anthem of Luxembourgh
I just went to listen to it and I think it's a pretty great anthem, sounds nice, great lyrics
Well done Luxembourgh
&#x200B;
As I barely know the ones from my neighboring countries, I doubt I'd not the ones from further away in Europe
Btw, I'm not a sports fan so I generally don't come across many nationale anthems
Funnily enough they don't. Sure you see the expensive cars (but most of them are company cars)
As housing is concerned I have concluded the following
They either live in a "normal standalone" house or they live in a forest
Meaning that their mansions are surrounded by tree's so nobody sees them from the street
So you think it is just a private forest with a gate
You have the occasional snob who shows off
Those are usually ignored
Buying big houses
Especially in summer when all the summerbars are open they love to spend money on expensive drinks/bottles so that everyone start looking at them
Almost got into a fight with such an asshole because we needed to move from his table while we were there first
I don’t care who you are if you don’t have any seating do like the rest of us and wait at the bar or go somewhere else
I don’t give them much attention as it is mostly ‘fils a papa’s’ spending their parents money
Nevertheless i refuse to go to summerbars again, now we meet up and go sit near De Schelde with our own booze and food that everybody brought a long to share
More fun, less drama and way more cheaper than being in a bar only to be seen
Well it is trashy
Just guessing it would be "familie" (family) just another everyday soap but it has been going for decades
Atm 30 seasons at 6823 episodes
Isnt ' thuis 'older then family
It's familie
I was also expecting thuis
West vlaams (coastal area and Brugge in Belgium), they talk like they swallowed their tongue
If a West Vlaming is interviewed on national television, they are always subtitled .
I just know West-Flanders is going to be mentioned
West Flanders represeeeent
It did get mentioned
You even have Wikipedia in western Flemish for the fact
I just knew that this was gonna get mentioned on this post
And as someone from West-Flanders I also don't always understand
Young people are no problem but when I hear some old people talking it really feels like a different language
By what definitions
I’m pretty proud of my West Flemish but I would not call it a different language
Really cool
It's unfortunate that all the recordings from the US (at least the 5-6 i tried) have such bad quality sound, i can barely make it out
Some dialects you really can't call dutch anymore lol, can't make out anything being said in the Vaals recording for instance
Sounds more German than Dutch
Well, Zeeuws is a 'overgangsdialect' between the Flemish and Hollandic dialects
i was very confused at first when i clicked on the first wikipedia result for "Karel Cogge", unreadable lol
Last year was the first year I didn't get to see snow at all :( I'm a bit anxious that when I have kids, that they won't ever see snow here in Belgium
Have you been sleeping under a rock
Software engineers with tattoos and piercings are super common
I AM one
Comma for decimals, spaces for thousands :
10 569 745,369
I use spaces as a decimal separator and because my elementary school teachers couldn't see the difrence between a point and a comma
So I write 1 000 000,00€.
Yep same with your rebelious southern neighbours
Might be my gaming background but I've used things like "I have xK in the bank".
I've been using that in international conversations to avoid confusion
Can confirm
And if you are working in a scientific field you usually won't use ',' but '.' As decimal seperator
Here in Belgium at least it's either €1,55 or 1,55 EUR
Thanks Napoleon
Usually it's expected that people's religion (or lack of it) is something more or less private
Being an atheist is fine, but it's not something you're supposed to preach about
That means you're the vast majority in this country
I can confirm because I don't know her name
Thanks for mentioning, I honestly didn't know
I don't follow the news and have no interest in politics
So I just assumed that as we don't have a federal government we also didn't have a PM or that Charles Michel was still in place until a federal government was made
Just stop making new ones
It works wonders
Yeah and her name is Sophie Wilmès.
But nobody care
Oh yeah, 15 year old student fucking his 40 something old teacher is so french
We literally had a test about 2019 last week on school and one of the questions was who our prime minister is
I think more than half of the students in my class didn't know the answer
Funny thing is I had completely forgotten about her
We don't really give a shit here any more because it's such a fucking mockery
17 just like me
I know
We even learned her name
Some people wrote Bart De Wever, wtf
Everyone knows he is the Emperor of Flanders
Both in my own language as while im talking in English,  I use 's' instead of 'sh'
buddah-pest; so the s sound
Though people I know who have visited tend to obnoxiously insist on the "sh" sound
There is no sh sound in Dutch except in loanwords and in diminutives of words ending with s. (s + je becomes "shuh")
So we say Boedapest with an s sound
French (I understand it with lots of effort and am far from fluent) and German so I'd be fluent in all three of our national languages
Spanish because it is spoken by a vast percentage of the world and it would, as far as I've been told, also makes Italian somewhat understandable to me
Edit: Also West-flemish, those peasants are hard to understand without subtitles
Spanish and Russian for sure
The third one I don't know
My French is pretty good but I'm definitely not fluent and it's almost a requirement to speak French for a lot of jobs
On the other hand if I would talk to French people for a couple months and follow French media I'd be fluent
But I'd be more interested in knowing Japanese or (Egyptian) Arabic because they're very hard and I'd like to visite Japan and some Arab countries
English, because mastering it is the true art
French because it's a national language and i'm trash at it and Norwegian because i fell in love with the country last year
Mandarin, Arabic, Swahili
As I already can express myself in Dutch, English, French, German and Spanish, I would be able to communicate with people in a lot of countries in the world in a "local" language
Japanese, Arabic, and Russian
It'd be awesome to be fluent in these three completely different languages, and which aren't as popular as others
I am from Flanders and I can understand your pain
However, the learning curve of French (and many other languages) isn't linear
I had to learn French for 8 years and the progress I made in that last year was HUGE
Learning a language takes time and suddenly your progress will increase exponentially
, so don't give up
>a third one that doesn't make much sense learning just to look cool
Klingon and Elvish bring in all the chicks, I've been told
I don't think many people in the Balkans speak Russian
If I have to believe the other commenters and you it seems like: French is somewhat easy for Italian speakers and Italian is easy for Spanish speakers but not vice versa
As others have said
I'm Flemish and I was indeed taught French
French isn't a class many like though, kinda like Math
All Flemish people eventually learn French up to a different degree, but not every kid is interested or good in languages
Sadly, I was both
I barely passed those classes
As I have a form of dyslexia, languages were never my strong suit, and as a teenager I kinda gave up on it, and focused on science and math
On top of that, I never have to use much French while I often have to use English, so it is extremely rusty and somewhere in the back of my head
Both of them are notorious exceptions and I've never used either of them in my daily life for the last 21 years
If you want to order a beer, you make eye contact with the barman/woman, show a hand with the pinky up, and then a beer will come your way shortly
You are perfectly in your right to refuse a beer you just ordered if they serve it to you in the wrong glass
As soon as the curtains close, all the people who aren't tied to the barman or any of the regulars are expected to leave
When the barman says he'll round up, don't be a dick about it
Now, this I like
Is this only in Belgium
Always thought this was a pretty widespread thing
I've only seen it in Belgium, but I might be wrong off course
Yes it's mainly branding even
Serving it in a glass that's not even a beer glass is just on a whole other level of not done
Are you even drinking a real beer at that point
But if it's some weird wine-like glass but the brand is actually correct, then that's considered to be the brewers fault and not the café's. You'll never really see that on any Belgian (or German) beers though, it's usually foreign brands who come up with these weird non-beer glasses
If you want to be special and unique take a lesson from Kwak or La Corne, those actually have cool glasses
But I'm getting a little off track here
Not serving a beer in it's correct glass is honestly the biggest cultural "no-no" I can think of in Belgium
Not even someone calling fries "French Fries" can match the pain it causes to see someone drink a Duvel from a Chimay glass
Not to long ago there was this guy on r/BELGICA (kind of like the ich\_iel from Belgium) who got permanently banned for posting [this picture] And even on the official r/belgium, right between 'No agenda pushing' and 'Respect \[Serious\] threads' there is the famous 'Rule 5' which states the following: *"Do not advocate serving Belgian beers in beer glasses that weren't specifically designed for those beers
If the beer has no specific glass, the rule can't be violated, but it's probably not worth drinking anyway".*
(EDIT: This might seem like a long-winded answer to such a simple question, in which case my apologies
But you have to understand that I am very passionate about this matter
Yeah no I have no clue either
It was just an assumption really
Yes of course they have it here as well
I'm not trying to criticise foreign brands or anything
The reason I said that is because I've had it a couple times around the Mediterranean, (probably because of the heavy wine culture
But I didn't want it to come over like that, so sorry
I just really dislike drinking from glasses like that
I remember drinking a local beer once which had a glass that was so thin that I broke it while holding it, so maybe it's just some sort of trauma
Idk they just feel a little too uptight for a beer
I like the feeling of a good sturdy glass
But that's just personal opinion
Like I said, I was getting of topic
There are a lot of armed police in Antwerp, they protect the large orthodox Jewish community there
I think it's the second largest orthodox Jewish community in the world outside of Israel, after New York
Same in Belgium
If I'm not mistaken that 5 continent thing is more about continental plates/drift
7 is Celsius
5 is Kelvin
In a sense
Neither is wrong, just depend in what context you're speaking
True
But in some context we also just said Eurazië (Eurasia)
In my school a continent was defined as "one piece of landmass that is completely connected
" It differs from an island only in size: everything bigger than Greenland is a continent
Everything smaller than Greenland and Greenland itself is an island
All this implies that there are 6 continents:
• North-America
• South-America (split from North-America by Panama canal)
• Eurasia (Asia and Europe are a connected piece of land)
• Africa (split from Eurasia by Suez canal)
• Australia (bigger than Greenland, so is a continent)
• Antarctica
There are litterally a 100 different ways to define a continent
That’s more of a historical concept, rather than a geographic one
If we go by tectonic plates we would also have a lot of small ones that are nearly pointless
There are areas that are rather fractured
It's about major landmasses
That's why America and Eurasia are one, and Australia doesn't include the rest of the islands in the neighbourhood
Other way arround
Europe and Asia as a seperate continent is historic while Eurasia is geographic
Til
Thanks
No problem :)
I'll give the reasoning (just because)
There is no geographic reasoning to see Asia and Europe as seperate continents, only culturaly and historicaly you can find reasons for this
It is starting to be really good in the region around Antwerp
Going by bicycle paths it appears that Flanders is similar to the Netherlands while Walloon is the polar opposite
Happy with what we have here in Flanders but I don't think I can speak for all of Belgium
My city, Leuven, is a university city with ~33% of the population during the semester being students
The infrastructure is *okay* but could be better
But there are so many bicycles (~44% of trips are made by bike) that it doesn't really matter all that much
Cars HAVE to pay attention to bicycles because there are so insanely many of them
I think in Flanders in general it is getting better, but there's a reason we recently invented the word 'moordstrookje' (murder strip), meaning a narrow part of a busy road with heavy traffic, which serves as a bike path, and is very dangerous
Like this one:
I still feel unsafe riding my bike in a city I've never been in
Traffic situations are often unclear
I like the fact that "fietsostrades", bicycle highways between towns, are more common
However, speed pedelecs going at 45km/h are a real danger
Brussels is a very car-centered city, but cyclists are increasing, leading to more road rage
Wallonia is an other case, with many hilly parts, I hope a Walloon compatriot can chime in
As a person living in Antwerpen (well, at least in one of its districts), I am very surprised that Antwerpen, for some people, is used as an example of a region where cycling infrastructure is "good".
Yes, there is the "Fietsostrade", which as far as I know, is something other parts of Flanders/Belgium not have
But my knowledge is limited on that topic
And we can be proud it exists
The person that started the project, should get a reward
However
"Fietsostrade" can get very overcrowded during rush hours
Not to mention the many pedestrians using the bike lane for walkies
And then there are the prams &é"'(§è!çà and the e-bikers whizzing past at lightning / breakneck speed
Bike traffic jams at crossings "managed" by traffic lights, which have "elleboogdrukknopjes" that have no effect at all except spread Corona virus and keep cyclers busy
The crossing of the Schelde river
The elevators in the tunnel seem to be like Eden Hazard
More often injured, than playing
Again
Traffic jams during rush hours !
In the city, only the very brave should attempt to ride their bike in streets like Ommeganckstraat, or Brederodestraat, to name just these, or just any street where the bike line and the tramway share the same area
For those unfamiliar with Antwerpen, one is a street next to Antwerp Zoo, the other one is a very busy street with lots of shops in the south of Antwerpen
Parking your bike is also a problem, especially in the center of Antwerpen
Hardly any parking spaces, and a lot of bike theft (of which solving doesn't seem to be a priority for local cops)
Once outside the city limits, often bike lanes are again just painted on the roads and qualify again as  'moordstrookje' (murder strip), the narrow part of a busy road with heavy traffic
Or the bike lane is next to the footpath and is very uneven requiring a custom-build suspension fork to absorb the many potholes
So, if Antwerpen is considered good, then I feel sad (and bad) about the rest of the country
Belgium is "car country". Bikes are not of interest to politicians, as there is hardly any money to be made out of a bike, in comparison to the money made out of cars in taxes on petrol, parking fees
But I agree
It could be worse
I always felt safe cycling on a place like your linked to
And thought it was an OK bicyle road (indication)
Maybe I trust the people in their cars too much who knows lol
First of all, I agree with most of what you said (rushhour is something that is kinda hard to fix in a densly populated area, so I don't think it's fair to complain about that
Or do you want bridges/tunnels at every crossroad
But I specifically said "region arround Antwerp" to not include the district of Antwerp itself as I recognize that this isn't perfect (als a lot harder to fix)
But to be fair, most of Antwerp is "zone 30" so still pretty safe (in theory)
I also said that it is *starting* to get really good, not that it already is really good
In the last 4 years the cycling infrastructure in Antwerp has been improved *a lot*. The fact that I can safely take my bike and drive from Hoboken to De Scheldelaan (Port of Antwerp) while constantly staying on a bicycle track, or to almost every university campus of the UAntwerpen has to account for something
So, considering the infrastructure that has already been build the last few years and that is planned to be build, I think that it is fair to say that Antwerp is starting to be really good for cycling
Wij hebben dus soms zulke fietspaden op wegen waar auto's 70km/u mogen vlammen
Totaal krankzinnig
Maar in vgl met veel andere landen mogen we dan weer niet klagen
They're safer than no bike lane but such a road really requires separated bike lanes
The basic question when designing bike infrastructure shouldn't be:"would I cycle here
" But rather:"would I allow my 10 year old kid to cycle here alone
Quite so
On the whole, Antwerp bikecitizens are well off
However
Compared to Denmark, Holland
not quite there yet
Compared to Portugal
I feel sorry for those people
Denmark is relatively MEH when it comes to bike infrastructure outside of Copenhagen
Or you are a troll or you are just crazy
We have bikes with two sets of gears
And they aren't that expensive
And biking in Lisbon, even with those fantastic gears you're on about, would be hell
Ever been there
It's literally build on 7 hills by the river
In Dutch we have: Wat was was voor was was was
This can have 2 meanings:
1) What was 'was' before 'was' was 'was'? (the answer is 'is')
2) What was 'laundry' before 'laundry' was 'laundry'? (the answer is 'clean clothes)
"klopt als een bus
Translated: "as right as a bus". Used to express when something is just right
And yes, I'm talking about a bus that drives
How
You forgot one meaning: What was wax before it was wax
Actually that isn't completely correct as it's a mix of "het klopt als een zwerende duim
" And "Het sluit als een bus
" So "kloppen" in this context would be literally translated to "throbbing". The bus is not a vehicle either, it's an old word for a box
Which makes it even more ridiculous as the literal translation would be "It throbs like a box".
Het klopt als een zwerende duim = it throbs like a festering thumb
Het sluit als een bus = it closes like a box
Honestly I've never heard of that
I learned something today
Still pretty weird yeah :D
* Father Damian (saint)
* Leopold II (Only king I'm gonna mention since he's the most notorious and had the biggest global impact)
* René Margritte (surrealist painter)
* Hergé (comic book artist)
(I'll try less recent ones from now on, they will predate Belgium, but lived in the area)
* Peter Paul Rubens (painter)
* Pieter Brueghel (the elder) (painter)
* Godfried of Bouillon (king of Jerusalem)
* Gerard Mercator (mapmaker)
* Andreas Vesalius (anatomist)
* Ambiorix (gallic chief)
There's more but if I go on the chances are they are not that well known, or they are mostly famous in one part of the country (Flanders vs Wallonia)
Worth pointing out that Flemish Belgians and Walloon Belgians will not know the same people
Plus since most of the people you mentioned are culturally important but perhaps not historically as important;
* Leopold I
* Leopold II
* Mercator
Thank You for helping out Belgium, but
no thanks
Dutroux
You will not be making many friends with Belgians by calling him an historical figure
And I think you mean "Soeur Sourire". Or not
Why not have both :)
François Who ? Or do you mean Father Damian, the one that cared for the lepers on Molokai ?
I would add Raymond Goethals; Dirk Frimout; Wilmots; Toots Thielemans; pater Damiaan; Rubens '; Breughel,....
Karel Martel grandfather of Charlemaine is also very significant
I wouldn't associate Rubens and Bruegel with the Netherlands since most of their work was done in modern day Belgium (and as a proud Belgian I say they belong to Belgium)
For Bruegel I can agree he's partially dutch, but Rubens was Flemish
Let's hope he's"history" soon
Soeur Sourire made #1 spot in US charts, and I must admit I had never heard of Soeur Emmanuelle
Reading the name "Emmanuelle" made me think of a very different person, certainly not a nun, and not Belgian :)
Indeed :)
r/brandnewsentence
Here in Belgium they are just lying passed out in the streets or puke everywhere
They come here drinking trying to keep up with the locals but our beers have like double the amount of alcohol
The last brit I saw was a few weeks ago in my regular bar i go to
Big attitude, yeah lets drink i'll show you how we do it
He was passed out on the floor at 10h.
> As an active dialect speaker, I actually feel less weird speaking English than standard German, if that makes sense
Same, but for Standars Dutch
I hate it with a passion
"Allons enfants de la patrie" - then Prime Minister Yves Leterme when he was asked on Walloon TV to sing the Belgian national anthem in French
edit: wasn't PM back then, but was about to be
[Link to vid]
Live is no pony camp
Didn't one of your ministers also say something like 'France is a great country, just unfortunate that there are so many French people inside it'?
I mean, Erna Solberg is a fucking riot as well
Examples include:
- Being asked on Twitter to legalise marijuana, replying with "Nah, don't wanna".
- Livestreaming her PUBG games on Twitch
- Livestreaming Bruno Mars concerts on Instagram
I think spaghetti is rather popular in most European countries
[I was mistaking, he was "formateur" and about to be PM] oh and he also answered incorrectly on what they were celebrating on our National day
Tbh I agree with her lol
Isn't she an absolute queen
We see them as cheap(er) workforce that do jobs many Belgians don't want to do anymore (like cleaning)
But on overall I think we don't have any negative thoughts about Romania
You forgot Switzerland and Belgium, who have large parts of their country being Romance speakers
The most famous one is the Grand Place of Brussels ([google street view link] ), and in particular the [town hall]
Most people know about 'Manneke Pis' (The peeing man) in Brussels, but my city Geraardsbergen actually has the real Manneke Pis, or so we claim
[Onze-Lieve-Vrouwenkathedraal (Cathedral of our Lady)] The special thing about is that one of the towers remained unfinished
It's definitely a treasured building in among the citizens
There's even a general rule is that no building in Antwerp may surpass the 123m tall tower, or at least withing 2km of the cathedral
[The Central Station] is good runner up
The inside has a beautifull mix between it's original architecture, and modern expansions
My hometown also has a castle
It's called The Castle of the Dukes of Brabant, [here's a picture] that I took
It's right in the centre of the city and my old high school is right across of it
> The castle of the dukes of Brabant has a long and eventful history
The building probably dates from the early 13th century
For centuries it served as a settlement and a hunting seat
The coat of arms of Maria van Zimmeren, Lady of Turnhout, is displayed above the entrance
A lawcourt has been established in the castle since 1796
In the French era, noble families disappeared from the castle and dilapidation was inevitable
Around 1800 the French government started using the building as a court and as a prison, as deprivation of freedom became the common punishment
In 1807 the castle was sold to the City of Turnhout, which let it to the ministry of Justice
When in 1904 prisoners were moved to the new prison in Wezenstraat, the justice of the peace court moved to the castle
It became property of the province in 1908, which ordered architect Jules Taeymans to restore it
He gave the castle its current exterior appearance
It became property of the state in 1975
The Buildings Agency made a major effort to restore the whole back to its old lustre
Because of this, the Turnhout court is now established in a wonderful historic monument
In the moat you can see the Naiad, the goddess of all springs and rivers
She settled down here in 1991
This is what Rik Poot imagined water nymphs from Greek mythology looked like
These days it's the Court of First Instance of Antwerp (province) division Turnhout
Where I live during the school year we have a famous medieval Cathedral (Sint-Baafs), the Gravensteen Castle, some medieval Abbeys, ...
The list goes on and on, while where I live with my parents, there is only an old neighbourhood from the 1860-1930s and a WW1 hospital, because of the strange environmental circumstances (dunes), but in the next village there’s the ruins of a Medieval abbey, and more landwards there’s a medievak city, with a few churches, 9th century protection wall, 18th century fortress remnants and some other buildings
The region was Belgium’s last stand during WW1
I like the one in Leuven more
One of my favourite cities in our great country
Leuven is nice too, but the question is about one's city, and I'm from Brussels ;)
Marteau in modern French
Martel ( or Martell ) is just the ancient French word for marteau ( hammer )
The D is soft, right
I'm going more for 30's than 25's now, but here it goes:
**Portugal:** earn 1400€ bruto (1000€ netto), save some 300-400€ after paying living expenses
**France:** earn 3000€ bruto (don't remember netto, maybe 1900€), save some 1000€ after paying living expenses
**Belgium:** earn 4300€ bruto (2700€ netto), save some 1500€ after paying living expenses
**Belgium, for your 25yrs old (my last salary):** earn 3600€ bruto (2300€ netto), save some 1200€ after paying living expenses
Always living alone in an apartment
All values for 14 salaries per year (so twice a year you get a full-paycheck bonus)
Exact same thing with us, and the Greeks also
The South of Europe is becoming just a retirement home for old Germans, Belgians, French, etc
that belgian wage is obscenely high for that age
2700 euro net when just graduated is a very high salary
May I ask what you studied/what field you are in
I think most starting salaries for having completed university would be around 2000 net but will rise quite a bit with how long you work in that field/job
But a lot of people get extra benefits such as company car, extra health insurance and what not
> You wont earn anything in the private sector
I was contacted by an engineering firm to work in Luxembourg (not many of those there
), and when asked for the net salary they paid the same thing as I did at the time in Belgium
Yeah
Same netto for 3x the housing prices
I don't think so
Banking there pays well tough, no
I mentioned that I'm already going for 30's, and it's an achievable wage of you work in STEM
2700 is for 5yrs experience (Mechanical Engineering), just graduating is more like 2200-2300
Rent, food, gas, the occasional night out (tough not too many, bar/restaurant life is expensive here)
So far Belgium has been the country with the higher salaries vs
cost of renting that I've personally seen
I suspect that in Germany you can make even more money and rents are similar, but it's difficult to access that
I had a Portuguese contract (" detached worker contract"), paid Portuguese taxes, even tough I was working in France for a French salary level
For that salary level, taxes in Portugal are higher than in France, for sure they were higher than 25%.
That was actually a low-ish salary in France
If you come from a good university directly to a good company, you can make a lot of money there
But most people (as I was) are hired as outsourcers, with shit/precarious conditions and low salaries
No, you also included a wage for 25 yrs old, which is still an obscenely high wage
May be achievable with a combination of good soft skills, working really hard, and plain luck, but extremely out of the norm in my experience
3600 gross at 25 is not difficult in STEM
Maybe not for the average worker, but for the average STEM worker is not unbelievable if you work at a big company
I work in STEM and know nobody at 25 who is even close to that
Traveling between the Netherlands, Belgium and France would become very confussing for tourists
The tax stream is reversed south to north
;-)
People would complain about struggling to find a new good frituur to get their fries from
Language swap, north is now probably less wealthy, different culture, completely different political views
And someone foreign trying to learn Welsh would now be pissed as the small differences are now not correct anymore
The actual tax stream is from Brabant to the periphery
That would stay the same
Counter to that, you would be able to visit a few new ones in a row which is always fun
The difference in wealth isn't between North and South but between Brabant and the rest of the country
Brabant would flip over ultimately changing nothing, and people will still complain about "transfers" from North to South
It is seen as gross
Cars that pass by will often honk if you are seen doing that
there are public urinals in open air
it's pretty common
otherwise it's looked down upon but bums still do it all the time, nobody cares because what are you gonna do
It is
Then why are there public urinals on some squares and such
In my experience nobody really cares
Ofc it is seen as gross to pee against a building or such tho
i have memories from high school of looking at my friends in the eyes when they were taking a piss so that they would feel gay and awkward
it was a common gig we did
I like my pasta still crunchy
On a serious note though al dente is fine for me but not a real must either I'm not difficult about it
My dad likes everything like pasta and vegetables overcooked though so when they cook it's gonna be soft pasta
Most of the people close to me hate al dente pasta
I personally hate mushy pasta (which is unfortunately the standard in Belgium as far as I know)
That's sooo annoying
The water is either 50°C or 1°C
Before I clicked  thought that word was a synonym for yeeting
I think they meant the car had a start-stop system so the car doesn't idle at red lights
As soon as you put it back in gear, the engine starts again automatically
The closest we have in Wallonia-Brussel, is [La dictée du Balfroid] A spelling contest where 6th grade children have to write a text read to them
It used to be shown live on  television (maybe still is, I don't know)
I think this concept is better that the spelling bee, because it's the same text for every children, it's more fair
And the words have some context within the text, not just random unrelated words
We used to have a spelling competition on tv here
It was once a year and aimed towards adults
Dutch is a disaster with weird spellings
Is it d/dt/t? Two O/E/A/U or maybe one
Is it oe/ou
I’ve struggled with my own first language since childhood
We have spelling tests in school, and every year there is a 'Grand Dutch Dictation' where hundreds of Flemish and Dutch people compete
Someone reads a complicated text aloud, you write it down, and the one with the fewest mistakes wins
Dutch can be a rather complicated language
Don't think it's even just a question of non-English speaking countries
I never came across one growing up in the UK
Here in the Dutch-speaking half of Belgium, there used to be a TV spelling competition, though
Dutch is a bit less regular in terms of spelling than e.g. Italian
Ly and j sound the same in modern Hungarian
> You can write [o], o, ô, au or eau for instance
No, o and ô don't sound the same, and o and au/eau don't sound the same either
When does ou sound like oe
In some rare French word
D/dt/t and double/single vowels is based on rules
You just have to apply them
You can't compare that with English orthography that just needs to be memorized
Those competitions are barely Dutch
So many French words that no one ever uses
Dutch spelling is pretty okay except for:
-ij or ei
-au(w) or ou(w)
-c or k/s
-Ctie or -Csie (C = any consonant)
And there are even some hidden rules for these kind of things
Loanwords tend to have au, ei and c. Strong verbs have ij, weak verbs have ei
Ou is always followed by W, D or T (except in the word count and some English loanwords)
Dutch children might also have problems with g/ch, v/f, z/s and aai/ei depending in their accent
But we can't change the spelling every time a sound merges somewhere in the Netherlands lol
On the other hand, Dutch children might not have a problem with -Ctie and -Csie like Flemish children
O sounds like ô before S and also at the end of words (when you ignore the silent letters): pro, mot, chose, poser etc
Belgian dutch kid here and while I dislike that we had to learn French I can't deny that having a good understanding of both a Germanic and a Latin language is incredibly benificial
Always write -en- except
...if the word has a plural with -s: groentesoep
...if it shouldn't be taken literally: reuzeleuk, apetrots
...if it's zonne-, mane- or koninginne-
I have never seen anyone make a mistake for this unless they are older and grew up with different rules
You always write the trema at the start of the second vowel sound
The ie vowel is spelled "i" in open, unstressed syllables in the middle of a word
Otherwise it's "ie". So bacteriën, knieën, oliën... For this exact same reason, you write "centrifuge" rather than "centriefuge" etc
I don't think children have a problem with this
But yes, it can be hard for adults who don't read that much
You will forget these kind of rules immediately
Also in West-Flanders
Some dialects in Flanders even distinguish ou and au
That rule got abolished in 2005
I think it is just these two rules now, with just those 3 exceptions
De geschiedenis van die tussenletters is best interessant
Voor samenstellingen gebruiken Germaanse talen de genitief ( -s-, -e- of -en-)
Die uitgangen begonnen hun eigen leven te leiden en zelfs in het Duits komt het niet steeds meer overeen met de genitief
Tegen het eind van de middeleeuwen sprak niemand nog met naamvallen, maar men bleef ze wel schrijven tot in de jaren 40
Tien jaar later kreeg men vanzelfsprekend moeite met het schrijven van samenstellingen, dus verzon men gewoon nieuwe regels
Schrijf een s wanneer je die hoort, schrijf e/en wanneer je een doffe e hoort
De N schrijf je alleen maar als het woord "in het meervoud hoort". Deze nieuwe regels leken heel simpel, maar bleken onmogelijk
Bessesap was zonder N want één bes heeft al sap, maar bessenpulp was met een N want voor pulp heb je blijkbaar meerdere bessen nodig
Vrouwenborst was met een N maar niemand begreep echt waarom
Er werd verwacht dat je enorme lijsten van samenstellingen vanbuiten leerde
Dus men besloot nieuwe, intuïtievere regels toe te passen in de jaren 90
De paardebloemregel waar jij het over had was omdat men biologische namen niet wou veranderen
Elke plant heeft een vaste Nederlandstalige wetenschappelijke naam
Maar tegen 2005 besloot men alsnog om ook de nieuwe regels toe te passen in de biologie
In het Zweeds verschijnen er in sommige samenstellingen soms klinkers als tussenletters (zoals -o- en -e-), maar dat valt ook niet te begrijpen zonder de naamvallen van Oud-Noors te kennen
Belgium:
Vote
Wait 2 years
Magic doesn't happen
Have an illegitimate government
Sleep
Repeat
Please wait for about 8 years while I type up a post that *vaguely* lets you know how it works
Kinda
The head of state is always the monarch but the head of the government is chosen among the parties that negotiate a majority government after the elections
Normally trough voting but last years the new trend is to choose them their selves and put all the winning parties off side
It's the 2nd time it lasted 500 days before they could get a goverment together
We have even ministers without votes
I wish we were more like you guys
Aaah
The goverment in 'lopende zaken'.
There's nothing illegitimate though
And don't start the "they didn't win" explanation
They sort of are both legitimate and illegitimate
They were not properly elected by popular vote, so in that sense, no, they are not legitimate
On the other hand, they were chosen after négociations, so in that sense, they are legitimate
My feeling is that out politics is so fucked up for the past 20+ years that nothing is legit anymore
Regardless of the political affiliation/regiin/language/etc
This country does not work anymore
We need global change in mindset in all political parties
What worked a long time ago does not anymore, and politicians need to realise that
While I agree our politics are fucked, our system was always a system of coalition, nothing illegitimate about it
Yes, other parties had more votes, but they don't have a majority
By their early 30's for sure, but most people I know aren't pressured to settle down in their 20's. Housing market is rather expensive so many stay with their parents until their late 20's. Granted they often have to pay a small ammount of rent as soon as they have a proper income
Both me and my sister stayed home until our late 20's without facing any real pressure from anywhere basically as far as I know
We both saved up until we could get the house we wanted with a small loan and then moved out
This is from a rather wealthy family by the way
It wasn't a "we totally can't afford it" thing
It was a "we can afford way more if we play this smart and don't rush it
"(parents told me literally 30 minutes ago their 10 year old business was appraised for 4 million
They're looking to sell and retire)
Could have moved out at 22 and saved €400/month
Or I stay and save €2000/month
Not a hard decision for me
The deal was basically "as long as you save up a lot of money we're willing to pay for X, Y, Z." My sister wanted to buy a house with her boyfriend and my parents were rather pushy in that she needed to own and pay for half of it for security reasons
Hence they also encouraged her to save
So all our income basically went to a bank account and we rarely took anything from it
I left home with 250k in the bank
No at least in in the 20s by the time they get over 30 they may get some minor shame
Yea, reading it again I see it
Just defaulted to personal anecdote
Still, the not being pressured into moving out should still be consistent I think
At least in my wider family
Don't think anyone moved out before 26
West Flanders - Farmers with a dialect so unintelligible from regular Dutch it might as well be its own language, if it even is a language at all
East Flanders - Ghent is a West Flemish colony
Antwerp - arrogant and drug dealers
Limburg - slow semi Germans
Brussels - place to go if you want to get stabbed at night
Charleroi - same as the above, and it's also incredibly ugly
Belgian Luxembourg - nobody lives here
Wallonia in general - lazy
Eupen Malmedy - rumoured to have mythical creatures called German speaking Belgians
What's with the royalists
Hey our language isn't horrible, Dutch from the Netherlands is
Leuven = snobby student capital0
Luik = Fortresses and forests, sometimes both at the same time
Namen = we care so little, we just gave it "name" as it's name
Region Antwerpen (not the city) = rich racists
Aalst = worst part of the marginal triangle
Ive actually never heard a stereotype about flemish brabant
As a Walloon currently learning Dutch, I gotta say Dutch from the Netherlands is awful but Flemish Dutch is aight
You guys are cool
It does not have more crime than your average European capital but it does have more crime than the rest of Belgium, it's only a meme after all
There are some areas you best avoid but still it's not like I would be anxious walking alone in Brussels at night
The only thing I know about it is ''het pajottenland''
That's a good reason to be fair
Molenbeek and Gare du Nord
Other than that you'll be fine really, no worries
Brussels is a nice city and Belgium is a beautiful country
Lots of great architecture and art history in the north, lots of nature in the south
Visit Bruges and Ghent if you get the chance
It's great
I live in Belgium and (in normal times) leave the country about once a month, even if it's just a day-trip to the Netherlands
It’s very nice from a cultural perspective
I love that I don’t have to travel far to be able to discover other cultures and places which feel so distinctly different from home
I can assume that for people travelling for their work it’s maybe not as nice that they might come across a different language and different customs
For me it depends on what you’d call often, but we did take smaller trips abroad more easily
Sometimes for leisure but our closest IKEA is in France as well
And I can be an international student in the Netherlands and still be relatively close to home
I grew up in Germany close the Dutch and Belgian border
We went to visit the neighbouring countries quite a lot, sometimes just for the groceries
There were certain things we'd always buy in the Netherlands, and things we always got in Belgium
And sometimes it's just boring to always see the same stuff at the supermarket, so a change of scenery is always interesting
I'm very used to just taking a quick drive to another country, it's just fun to have an many interesting places close by
You can drive 1h30m in any direction from our capital and leave the country
That fact has always amazed me
Not now we don't since international travel is still prohibited
But in Normal Times people just pop over the border fo work, shopping, leisure or just because they feel like
Depending on where live, you may even need to cross the border for your commute because it's faster than staying within the country
I live in Antwerp near the Netherlands, lots of people go to Breda for shopping, and I personally pop over a few times a year to go scubadiving in Zeeland
At least a few times each year, we spend the weekends abroad in our family (either with my parents, or with my SO's)
Usually Netherlands due to proximity, but we've done France and Germany a few times as well
If I bike an hour north I'm in Holland, 2 hours and I'm in France
It's still cool te be able to be in another country and culture even if it's close-by
Stays something special to experience differences in architecture, landscape, language, food, town signs
It's always a bit like going on vacation, even if you're just going to Auchan to buy water or st
Especially not now with Corona and all, as trips across the border are not recommended right now
Overall it is pretty nice, it actually makes travel by bus quite feasible, which made for some very cool school trips and summer camps back when I was younger
It decreases a bit as you age
Even though my country is small, I'm still 45 minutes away from the closest border
That is not a very long drive, but not a trip you make on the daily
Depending on where you travel to, it's also possible you don't speak the language, which is not very comfortable, as you can imagine
It feels similar, I would guess, as driving to another state in the US
But instead of being slightly different, you can get in an entirely different culture after driving but an hour
Belgian here
We visited London(we took a limo at our hotel around 1am with 10(no teachers), drank champagne, etc
), Paris and Barcelona(near a beach so go camp fires and a lot of alcohol) for several days
Lille is technically another country but that's just a day trip
Was to improve our French
I did everything using English
Haha
In high school we went to London, Paris and Prague (and also a day trip to Amsterdam)
London and Paris were tradition, the third destination would change over the years (it's been Berlin and Rome as well)
I would say, many different beer glasses
Beer is to Belgium what wine is to France, which means that there are many norms around it and we respect it more
And thus, every beer or at least type of beer (we have a huge variety) has to be drank in the right type of glass ([for example] So, it's not uncommon in Belgian houses to have a cupboard/dresser full of different beer glasses, basically being nearly as well equipped as a bar/pub holder (but with only one or two glasses of the same type or brand)
Because a beer in the wrong type of glass is seen as "blasphemous" here
I approve your message
And maybe also a deep fryer we all have at home
People who don't use the correct beer glass belong in prison
It's the only on I have at home
Very common in Belgium as well and I don't see them disappearing any time soon (seems to hold up trough generational changes)
Same for Belgium
> beers brand did as a gimmick and to make money
There is objectively a little bit of that
But, at the very least, you "should" have a glass of each type/shape
Not *obligatoirement* the right brand, but at least the right shape for the type of beer
A bit like you don't drink red wine in the same type of glass as champagne for example
In France too, types of wines are drank is their appropriate type of glass
Sure, some of them are
But what I mean is this (as already replied) "you "should" have a glass of each type/shape
Not imperatively the right brand, but at least the right shape for the type of beer
A bit like you don't drink red wine in the same type of glass as champagne for example
In France too, types of wines are drank is their appropriate type of glass
And a croque/waffle iron
It's a gimmick but as usual, gimmicks and the real thing are intertwined in Belgium
I guess so, most people I know have one, including myself
Why
It is not common in the Netherlands
Yes, at least good beers
It's relatively OK with inferior/cheap beers, such as pils and ales (which, by our standards, are just the adult version of lemonade), but with real beers, the ones that are at 7°-12° (the trappists, specials, abbey's), don't do it
We use a towel when handwashing
Or your dishwasher just takes care of it for you
Unless you're a student
Sure we do it, but we do it for beer too
And countries like France and Italy, which have good wines, will take more care about that that in countries with bad wine or no real wine culture
I'm quite sure that in Nordic countries, they don't really care as much as long a this is a wine glass, nor do they in Romania, where their wine is generally so bad it's seen as ok to put coca/cola in it
Beer is treated in Belgium the same way, with the same respect, French people show to wine
Wine countries are France and Italy
Spanish, German and Austria wines are considered sub-par wines compared to the ones of France and Italy
I don't agree with that
Every single one of those other countries also offer excellent wines

I am running a Minecraft server with some friends
We're not strictly European, though about half our players are European, mostly Belgian, and the server is hosted in Germany
We got people from outside Europe too, like from Panama and Australia
It's the plain Vanilla experience, although we made a small server modification ourselves to sync the in-game chat with our Discord
We're a tightly knit community of around 25 active players, of which three to ten are usually online at the same time
We're behind a whitelist, and usually new players only make it into the server by being referred to a friend
If you want you can send me a DM, and I can add you
Whitelisted servers can give a true feeling of multiplayer survival Minecraft an open server never can
There are some basic rules, like no raiding, griefing or being overly disrespectful to other members of the community, or abusing exploits that we as a community agreed in where a bit too OP, like certain item dupes
Stuff like AFKing or automatic farms are completely fine
Send me a private message if you're interested
Yeah it was fun, a bit of a shame it doesn't update yet
I'd like us to take a page from the US and allow for turning right on red at some intersections
They started doing it for bicycles at some intersections with a new sign, but there's lots of lights where I'd love the option to that with my car as well
Free table water in restaurants and even pubs
Absolutely ridiculous that we don't do it
I have found Belgian beers in Italy to
Blame the banks
Not an issue for our shop, swimming pool business so profit marges are dumb
€11 goods sold for €34(€42
00 with tax) but if you have thin profit marges and every transaction costs you €0
20 that's going to cut rather deep
I'm just annoyed that at the end of the day the mask is more to protect others and less so yourself
So I'm certainly going to wear one if I feel slightly under the weather in the future but it's not going to do me a lot of good if others don't.
Isn't there like minimum parking spots in the US for exactly that reason
(most of Europe has a max)
How can they have that and still fuck it up
Thing is, both France and Wallonia aren't flat like the Netherlands, so, even with good cycling infrastructure, it wouldn't become as popular as in the Netherlands
I think most Dutchies couldn't cycle in Wallonia even with Dutch-level infrastructure, too many hills and slopes, their legs are too used to flat terrain
Or to get rid of black money
Someone came over to pay €985 for something we sold her by mail and had delivered to her in cash
Aside from the roads thing, most older buildings are at least to some extent considered heritage, so renovating a house can be very hard
And if you stumble upon anything while digging, be prepared to have endless construction delays by  archaeologists coming to check out what you found
>Old houses and flats have terrible insulation and windows let in so much wind through the edges of the crappy sash single glazed windows - it's very unpleasant
Hard to heat as a result
Oh man yeah
I can still remember back in the day when we couldn't go to the toilet downstairs during the winter as it was too close to the outer wall of the house and the water would freeze up
We did some renovations since but we couldn't install double glass on the street side since it wasn't possible in the old framing and we didn't want to replace it (pretty sure wouldn't even be allowed anyway)
Every year some West Flemish farmer hits a bomb as well
Tactical voting is not really a thing here, as we elect our representatives who try to form a coalition with other parties in order to secure a majority in parliament
Last election some people did not vote for the far right party (known as Vlaams Belang) as since 1991, all Flemish parties agreed to NEVER EVER EVER form a coalition with them
As a result, they will never get the chance to govern, unless with an absolute majority
That being said, they were the second biggest party in Flanders last election, and the biggest party has a similar hard stance on immigration
There were talks but no accord, as they didn't have a majority together and all other parties were very clear that they would never govern in a coalition with Vlaams Belang
Needless to say, this made a lot of people angry and our next elections might go crazy
Never that I've heard of but we don't have a president anyway
We have a similar thing called 'Drie koningen', where kidd dress up as the three wise men from the bible and go door to door on January 6th in exchange for sweets
I thinks this is also bounded per region
My nieces for example still do this in the region Mechelen, but I never heard of it before they did that and I live in northern Antwerp (onle 50km away)
This is indeed how you do it
We have bise and non-bise regions, so you have to be prepared either way
edit: typo
Also there are some region where you do a different number of Bise
3 is the right number
Three is the only right number :p
All who never Bise are prude, all whom the number is one are unpolite, 2 is the number of a Conman but 4 and 5 are right out
You are bang on the money
None or one is impolite, and two feels fake/forced
Three all the way
You learn how to deal with it
Sometimes it won't work so one will have to reverse
With experience you'll know the spots where you can pass freely at high speed , etc
Not exactly true
I went to Ireland a few years ago and to make the comparison complete, there should be a rough stone wall on the right edge of the road
Kinda like [this example] but without the grass buffer inbetween
I was impressed by how courteous the drivers were
People instinctively backing up or setting themselves aside to let the other pass, and always kindly waving when you passed, or when you let them pass
Quite different from driving in and around Antwerp
Yeah driving in Belgium cities generally sucks in comparison of rural places where people are much friendly
I love it when it's a place where waving to the other driver as thanking sign is common
Another reason why this might be impossible is a fenomenon called "hollow roads", where the road erodes over centuries of usage before being paved properly
This way earth walls of 2-3 meters can form at both sides of the road because the road has sunk into the ground
There you need to pass eachother at widened passing points as well
the road was likely there before the car, and just paved at some point
For Flanders: [Vlaanderen boven]
It is mostly satirical
A mix of praising and stinging Flemish people
For example there are the lines:
• "Waar het geld in het zwart vloeit"  which basically says it is the place "where money flows dirty".
•"Waar een g soms een h is" (in west Flanders a 'g' often sounds like a 'h')
In the chorus he also sings:
•"Waar mensen belangrijk zijn, en buiken/pensen omvangrijk zijn"
(Where people are important, and tummies/paunches are bulky)
A song I very much associate with France is "Douce France" by Trenet, in particular I associate it with Southern France
To explain the "zwart geld": "zwart geld" is money that's never reported to authorities
"Omdat mensen belangrijk zijn" was also a very famous CVP slogan at the time the song was made, back when they were still the dominant political party in Flanders
As for Belgium as a whole, maybe "J'aime la vie" by Sandra Kim is one of the most widly appreciated songs
Loch Lomond is probably the song I associate the most with Scotland
I honestly thought that [this] would be the unofficial anthem of the Netherlands
I love "Merck toch hoe sterck", we often sing it at cantussen (traditional student drinking and singing parties, like "Kneipe" in Germany)
Bella Ciao was already a huge song before Casa de Papel
\*Money that should've normally been taxed, to be completely correct
Example: You let a plumber fix your sink, and he agrees to be paid in cash and he doesn't officially bill you, so it is cheaper for you (as taxes aren't included)
In that case you would've paid him in 'zwart' (black) and the money he now has is called "zwart geld" (black money)
Ah yes, our one and only Eurovision win
But yeah, I agree, but I wouldn't say it fits our countries spirit so to say
Would be a bit weird to have "Oh Canada" as the British anthem though
Except for Jacques Brel ;)
Yeah, better explanation
Hmm yeah, you're right
It's hard to find a song that both halves of our country can identify with though
Gwlad
Gwlaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
Grand anthem really
I didn't, almost never do, especially not when in discussion
I just wanted to remark that Bella Ciao was widely known where I live before the series (which isn't that big here I think)
Exactly
So I wonder what song Walloons would pick
Blankenberge in Belgium
Literally translates to “whites mountain”, considering Belgium is as flat as it gets and Blankenberge is a seaside town the name really doesn’t add up
East-Flanders is the second most Western located province in the country
It's the same for Walloons, Wallachia and many more  words with Wal(l)
Besides our Bergen 'Mons', we also have Heist-op-den-bergh, which, given the likelihood of 'heist' being an old cognate of 'highest', translates to
'Highest on the mountain'.
However, like most of Flanders, it's on completely flat land
I used to live there
There really is a mountain but he's only 50 meters high lol
There is this cartoon about Blankenberge
You have a family of Africans who visit Blankenberge and then you have this extreme right wing guy who point to the sign and say: “can’t you read
[the picture]
I think that it's up to the people to protect their own culture and make it live
If their culture dies, it's not because of some external force from the EU or globalisation or whatever else, it's because they stopped caring
If some of their cultural traits (e.g. local festivals, small dialect, etc
) aren't attractive enough to young people, it will wither away until it disappears
It's up to them to make their culture attractive in order to keep it alive
I take the time
Life is a marathon, not a sprint
It's useless to work like a donkey and getting burned out
You gotta realise that you gotta work till your 70
Unless you got an alternative plan and you can handle it, take your tim to live
Lie is too short too miss out on it
how old were you in the 90s?
When I was still active, I made sure I had time for a proper meal and enough sleep
It's nice to have a few autistic genes
It's a matter of organisation
Planning is key
Create a weekly menu
Go shopping during the weekend, or shop on the way back home in shops you know you can get in, buy stuff, and go in minutes
Buying a dishwasher also helps It does mean you get about an extra half hour of time free for more important activities
Go to bed at least 8 hours before your alarm wakes you, and do so every day
Create a routine
TV off at least half an hour before going to bed, the same with your smartphone
Get one of those apps that puts your phone in night "do not disturb unless I win the lottery" mode at a certain hour
Cutting back on alcohol also helps
So does removing all energy drinks from your menu
A nice cuddly partner also helps, but you can't get mine
Beating the world record for the longest period without a government has been something Belgium has been really into the past decade
Currently we’re on our way to beat our 2011 record for 589 days without a government
I bet none of these foreign losers can come even close to beating us
So sad for them
Same here
None of these foreigners are on our level tbh
It really is getting pathetic to see how way out of their league we are
If you know something is a problem it does not become less of a problem just because you do it in a remote area
In fact it's probably even more annoying because the clean up crews now have larger areas to cover
right after WW2 or in the 60's/70's ?
Brussels doesn't feel Belgian to me at all
Not just all of the foreigners, also all of the large buildings and ad billboards and trash everywhere make it feel so un-Belgian
Definitely Brussels
Obviously as its the capital and our biggest city, you see more POC than you would in a "regular" city, but you're also likely to hear every European language under the sun if you hang around the European quarter for a while
>Maastricht feels the most foreign
yea I have been to Maastricht many times and it feels very Belgian
Yeah, it always blows my mind how familiar it is
If you remove all the cycling infrastructure and most bikes, you honestly have a Walloon looking city
Even the landscapes around the city reminds me of a lot of Wallonia
[Maastricht] vs [Namur]
All of the cities in territories that used to be ruled by foreign powers count for me
Dunkirk feels very Belgian to me and while on vacation in Alsace, I constantly felt like I was in Germany because of the buildings and town names
Nice used to be an Italian city as well
It’s a world language, we can pronounce most foreign words with a little practice, we have latin and german influences, so it unites the latin languages and the germanic languages
Why not:
The Dutch speak it too
I would enjoy half of Europe talking Flemish and the other  half talking French
That way we can trashtalk bigger numbers over their language
Same as English TBF
Organisation or organization, color or colour
I'm Flemish and I can confirm that it's not that easy to learn German sorry not sorry
Easy to learn for speakers of Indo-European languages yes, not so much for other languages
I speak Walloon, but if it became the European Lingua Franca it would be very weird tbh
Dutch it is then
We have so many dialects we need subtitles to each other, so it wouldn't unite anything
I knew some French person would say this
My French friends told me in Australia they didn't like the Australians cause they didn't try to speak French to them
So sick of this chauvinistic bs
Where do I aply
I'll do it, I'll translate documents, please
Forget about the Dutch g sound
You can say it in a much softer way, which will make it sound more pleasing
And it will still be proper Dutch
Okay, but what if I said I don't have the patience to learn it
* Forcing all the population to speak French : it made Wallonia loose its historical and culture language(s), and it alienated the Flemings, Dutch-speaking Brabanders and Limburgers, which in the past were different identities/cultures, favorising the birth of the Flemish movement
Being a centralised country was a mistake too
* Letting Léopold II get Congo, for quite obvious reasons
Going apart from the Netherlands
I see this as an absolute win
(though not in earnest, you're one of the best neighbours a country can wish for <3)
Napoléon was the mistake, he destroyed the French revolution
Personally, anything in single digit Celcius is considered chilly
Cold is when it's freezing, normal is anything between 10-18, 18-25 is "the fuck is this summer or what" and anything above 25 is too hot
Anything above 33 is fucking horrible
For Belgium, based on our very high humidity :
- Freezing : -infinite to 0
- Cold : 0 to 15
- Chilly : 15 to 18
- Nice : 19 to 23
- Warm : 24 to 27
- Too hot : anything above 28
I wear a binder, so my temperature is a bit higher most of the time
Cold: -10 to 0
Chilly: 1-9
Nice: 10-18
Not so nice, but still okay: 18-22
Please don't: 23 - 25
Stop: 25-27
Too hot now: 28-30
I can't go outside: 30+
I live at 50
666379°N, and it's ok
I'm not someones who spend a lot of time outside, so, I don't really care about short days
And anyway, short days are soon over, since th 21st/22nd of December, they'll start getting longer (the true origin and meaning of Christmas by the way)
That we are a country
The only things uniting us are the king and football
HR was still filling in the paperwork
Well sure, there's plenty more stuff we share
However we very rarely feel 'Belgian', that feeling only comes with football pretty much
I know a Polish tongue twister (one about a beetle making noise in a field, can’t write it though) and how to say merry christmas
One time I said "yo tambien hablo español" to an Italian girl
We date for 3months haha
Ah yes that’s the one, I’ll definitely check out the poem as well (though I won’t understand anything else I’m afraid) and a wesołych świąt to you too
Ottignies part : [the instrumental of this song]
Louvain-la-Neuve part : [the instrumental of this song]
And I fucking love it
[Arlon]
Even the principal church sing it with it's carillon for the hours so I could usually hear it when I was still in school there
I'm giving our government capability to cooperate
Muhahaha
I give you five governments
What he's really offering is our ability to not take yourself too seriously
Which hardcore are you talking about
hardcore alone means nothing when it comes to music, plenty different genres use it
You have hardcore in rock/punk/metal, you have hardcore in rap, you have hardcore in electro
Huzzah a country of culture aswell
Ooh quite a contender to the Belgian political shambles, impressive
Well, hardcore is its own genre in punk/metal too, and it existed before electro/techno hardcore
So, when I read the word hardcore, what comes to mind to me is [this] or [this] or [this] if going back to the roots/beginning of the genre
Knokke Le-Zoute boys/girls
Based after a rich beachtown where a lot of entitled people go to

Belgian here
For some reason, I've never visited the Flanders Fields museum in Ypres (a World War I museum), even though I only live 20 km away from it
It's one of the most important tourist attractions in the entire region, and possibly in the entire country from a British perspective (given the huge amount of Brits visiting Ypres every year)
I don't know if that's something a lot of people do in Belgium, but I personally say "1 crocodile", "2 crocodiles", etc
Crocodile has the same meaning in French as in English
Why a crocodile ? Because it works
Same in Dutch: een-en-twin-tig, twee-en-twin-tig, drie-en-twin-tig (21, 22, 23)
As usual, STEM degrees are in high demand, especially civil engineers, as most of them have a job waiting for them while they're finishing their degrees
Law is a very solid choice as well
Most of them end up doing something law-related, but a law degrees gives you access to pretty much anything that is not science-related
Physics, Math and Computer science are usefull masters to have because they give you acces to jobs you would not relate to it
Obvious things ypu could do is get a Phd
and do research, you could teach etc
, but finance and insurance companies are actively searching for people with these degrees
Engineering, medicine (or any health care related degree) will give you nice jobs aswell
The most usefull thing you can have is a drivers licence, as even if you don't have a highschool degree you can find a decent job with it
Recognized does not mean of the same value though
A dutch nursing degree isn't seen as a full qualification here in Belgium for example
The Russian doctor who came to Belgian also had to take certain classes and tests
There are people who actually care about that
Like, I know it exists but if that's something that dictates what you wish to do with your life there is something seriously wrong with you
Might be because I don't really notice it here
A good construction worker isn't really seen lower than say, somebody working at a bank
Professor and such is another matter
The good old "baraque à frites" that we have in Belgium and France
Lights being on all of the time on the highways at night
Vending machines that sell beer cans in public spaces like train stations
>I've heard that our daily TV news programmes are way longer than what's normal elsewhere, they last for more than an hour typically
Don't know how true that is though
The news in belgium typically lasts 30-40 minutes
I guess you really like to be thorough
I'm not that patriotic by any means, but I've yet to find a place outside of Belgium that serves proper fries
I mean, bread is the thing you get for free here in restaurants
Wouldn't describe it as "loads of bread" but still
> black licorice
That's everywhere, and there no not-black licorice
I'll admit that your bread is the best one, though I hate to compliment the french
I prefer their croissants but I prefer our normal bread over their sticks personally :p.
Doesn't the Netherlands have "wapenstilstand" on the 11th of November
WW1 thing I suppose
An American friend pointed this out to me in a mixture of awe and shock
I never really had noticed because we grew up with these
But he was right, never saw a public beer vending machine outside of Belgium
They are not that common anymore, because sentiments are changing a bit
But I know a few night shops that stil have them outside
So they can serve the public 24/7
You can find some too in Brussels Midi Station, where the Eurostar arrives
Belgian beer culture is a thing, had my first (small) beer when I was 10 with my parents and grand parents
"red licorice" is mostly an American thing, and doesn't actually have licorice in it
It's an improper name
Come to Belgium in that case
You go out as a construction worker at 7am
Stop at the "hot" bakeries(those that make it themselves instead of buy it and sell it) and and buy all sorts of goodies, still hot, and cheap as fuck
Hell, once had to leave at 5
30am and just knocked at one before it was open to get my stuff
It's one of those things I miss a lot when I travel
TIL
Yea, hence why I said "WW1 thing I suppose". :p
So many interesting answers
Well, no one is innocent, I guess
What do you mean by innocent in this context
Definitely the Netherlands
If you think what happened in Congo is terrible, well, the Netherlands colonialism was the inspiration for Leopold II, he learnt his methods from them
And of course, their oppression against Belgium, and the fact they waged war to try and prevent independence
At least in Belgium, we know about the colonial atrocities, they are talked about, and not denied
But everyone seems to forget about the Dutch atrocities, they fly under the radar
And Dutch people still refuse to recognise they were oppressors when it comes to Belgium, they still seem to think they were right and that somehow we are the bag guy from freeing ourselves from their tyranny
Only if you compare it with other second-half 19th century colonial empires
I'm quite sure that colonial empires in the Americas were far worse than Belgian Congo, or even the Congo Free State
At least, there are Congolese people left
We can't really say the same for indigenous Americans in many countries
And where they are still alive, they are a small minority and are largely discriminated (with a very few exceptions like Bolivia)
You can blame the eradication of native Americans on diseases, but it was also the case in Congo as Malaria and Sleeping sickness were at an epidemic level at the time and probably killed more Congolese than Belgian policies did
Besides, the triangular trade and the conditions of exploitation of African slaves in the sugar cane plantations were also worse than what happened in Congo
They dropped like flies, which is why there was a constant need of new slaves coming from Africa
They didn't even have time to reproduce
Worked to death in a few years, then the new batch arrives
1918
Either 1908 (Belgian Congo) or 1885 (Congo free state) make sense but I don't get why you went with 1918 here
Everybody knows about Congo atrocities, it is one of the most famous thing, and no one denies it, even in Belgium
> there were few colonial empires that were worse than Belgium’s.
Indeed, there was the Dutch one, the main source of inspiration of Leopold II
What hands
We cut those off, y'know
I was specifically talking about the harsh conditions in Brazil or in the Caribbeans
In the US, for instance, slavery was less perilous and slaves indeed reproduced and the population grew
But that was almost an exception on the American continent
Still, slavery was only one part of my comment
There is the whole annihilation of native Americans thing too
I stand by my previous comment that colonization of the Americas was much worse than Congo
> Why do you feel the need to compare at all
Because OP started the comparison game
I quote:
> Belgium is often seen as rather innocent and harmless, but its colonial empire was probably **the worst out of all of them**.
I went on to discuss why I don't think that it was the worst out of all of them
> And why specifically did you choose slavery in the US when the US is not even a European colonial power
Where did I mention the US
I mentioned the American colonies, but I wasn't referring to the US
Did you know that America was a whole continent
I actually had in mind Spanish colonies when writing my comment, as well as in the Caribbeans
Well, on Reddit it is definitely not ignored, it's the one I have seen the most spoken about, while British, French, German, Dutch colonial crimes are never spoken about
I think the idea that Congo is forgotten about is widely outdated, it is the most spoken about these days, the most famous case of colonialism gone wrong (not that there is colonialism gone right mind you)
Maybe it was often ignored a few decades ago, but this statement isn't valid anymore today
Otherwise, Belgium wouldn't be the most common answer in this thread
Everybody knows about it
Perhaps is it because there is this constant bashing about Belgian Congo here on Reddit, and it's fucking tiring
Belgium deserves to be bashed about it, entirely
But the issue is that the people who do it are terribly uninformed about what happened there
They just know about cutting hands, '10' million dead and sometimes have heard that there are still Leopold II statues in Belgium, end of the story
Then they are outraged when they see Belgians coming with facts
People accuse these Belgians of being all kinds of evil because they assume that they just want to minimize (or even deny) what happened
If you point out that the Belgian government had no power whatsoever in Congo before 1908, you get accused of downplaying the involvement of Belgium
If you dispute the 10 millions dead figure (which is more of a guess dating back from the early 20th century, without census), you are downplaying the horrors that happened
If you mention that other nationalities were involved in the Congo Free State as companies and mercenaries, then you are rejecting the fault onto others
And if you dare say that it wasn't a genocide, by the commonly accepted definition of the word, then oh dear, you are a negationist
It seems that people just want to have a 100% evil colonial Belgium to bash so that they can think "at least our colonialism wasn't that bad compared to theirs" and sleep better at night, I suppose
When you see such discussion weekly here, your patience runs out
I imagine that you would understand that
I also see this with the US being blamed for a lot of stuff, sometimes unjustly, in European subs
Ah shit, here we go again
Belgium is one big mess of autonomous regions, and still nobody is happy
Belgium has 3 communities and 3 regions
The communities handle cultural matters (including education)
They are the Flemish, French and German community
The regions handle economical and territorial matters
They are the Flemish, Walloon and Brussels region
Flemish and French community have a say in the cultural and educational matters in the Brussels region
German community is part of the Walloon region
There are a total of 5 governments (federal government makes for the sixth)
Flemish government for Flemish region and community
Brussels government for Brussels region
German government for the German community
French government for the French community
Walloon government for the Walloon region
They are currently looking into combining the French and Walloon government into one single government
As you see, it's complicated
When I have a few hours, I will explain it for you
Our autonomous regions have a country
> They are currently looking into combining the French and Walloon government into one single government
That wouldn't be possible because of the German community
However, ever since transfers between federal entities was made possible, a lot of Walloon regional competences were partially or totally transferred to the German community
That's indeed a more accurate way to describe us
It would be possible under the proposed "4 (or 2+2) states model", where the communities are abolished and all competences are transferred to the regions
OMG I have a pair of those always lying around on my desk somewhere
I love them a lot, I use them for everything, cutting my nails, cutting paper, cutting threads, sorry but even getting some of the dirt from underneath my fingernails (they've got a pretty fine thin tip, super useful), stabbing holes in things (like paper) etc
It's one of the items I made sure to bring along when studying abroad for 2 years
I never knew it was a certain brand
Only now I looked at the brand on the scissors and it is Fiskars indeed
Good to know, if this one ever breaks or if I ever lose it, I'll know how to find another one
&#x200B;
Apart from that, I don't think I've seen it in other places, I don't think it's necessarily a thing in Belgium (or maybe it is but I don't pay attention to other people's scissors)
I don't even know where I got mine from
Probably took it from my parents' house but not sure where they got it from
We would be part of France, what a terrible nightmare
It just would'nt exist anymore
Me not like it
French tyranny again !
I have no idea how that would look, Belgium with a government
I prefer no government to the terrible French government
Your government is a nightmare
with the current political state of our country, yes, very
Teachers of Europe, how are your students doing in 2020/2021
How far behind are they
Do you think they will get back on track
In Dutch we have the word "leerachterstand" (learning delay) when a student has not learned yet what is expected of him at that age
Do you think they will be able to overcome this delay and get back on track
I would also like to know how your students are doing emotionally compared to adults coping with the lockdown
I also wonder if there are differences across Europe
Oh wow, this was me at age 12-14 (2009-2011)
I took part in a school musical and got a very minor role with 2 sentences
I always went to repetitions even when I wasn't needed, just to flee home
That musical saved my mental health and grades, even though I did feel bad for getting such a minor role
My parents eventuallu decided that they would divorce once me and my siblings are graduated (they didn't want to be bad parents), and in the meantime they would just ignore eachother
We are almost all graduated now and they don't even speak of divorcing anymore
They think they're such great parents for not divorcing but don't seem to realize that the yelling took its toll on us
I feel so bad for you
Things will get better once everyone is vaccinated
I know that will take a few months, but you can do it
Why should a Greek person need Dutch language lessions
Not really
We don't really have dumplings in the traditional assortment of pastry
Usually more like 3 AM and more beers (or 4 strong belgian beers), and I would hope to find a frituur still open, otherwise it's usually döner
Bit early, but definitely a Julientje
Fries saté spices, flemish stew sauce, viandel (fried "sausage"), fried onions and mayo
Some fries probably, maybe pita or kebab, perhaps even a pizza if I'm with friends
Kapsalons are so goodddd
That's how you know German beers aren't proper beer but only flavored water
With 14 real beers, you would be too drunk to manage to go home
And Belgians
The [Atomium] or the buildings of the [Grand-Place]
The Atomium in Brussels, Belgium
One of the coolest building I've ever seen
Internationally it's likely the Atomium, but nationally I would like to argue for the Palace of Justice
It's been under renovation for so long  that the scaffolding is starting to disintegrate
I was thinking about the Atomium as well
I know it's not as iconic for the country and that I'm a little (or very) biased being from Antwerp, but I think [Antwerpen-Centraal Station] deserves a mention :)
I agree
Such a beautiful castle, and the military tattoo is amazing
I’d argue that the old town hall with its astronomical clock is the most iconic building in Prague
Arn't there quite a few hills in Ljubljana ? Must be hard without any gears on your bike !
&#x200B;
edit: looked it up and apparantly it's only the South-East part of the city that has hills
I hope you're comuting on the other side ;)

Went in Feb right before covid got big
Radiation is a bit anything higher than background
Anything "dangerous" you see on any tour would take days of constant exposure before it'd be a lethal dose
Lots of trees everywhere, even on the rooftops of lower buildings
In abandoned villages it's completely overgrown, fallen across houses etc
Didn't see a lot of wildlife
Saw fox tracks in the snow, and a deer or something similar in the woods
Couple of dogs in Pripyat, one at DUGA (Tarzan <3 ), more at the NPP but there are workers there who feed them
Oh and two black cats at a junkyard

January 1790 - December 1790: United Belgian States
1830 - 1914: Kingdom of Belgium
1918 - 1940: Kingdom of Belgium
1944 - ... : Kingdom of Belgium
The country has a whole have been free since 1830 to 1914, 1918 to 1940 and 1944 to nowday but some part of our kingdom has been free before like the prince évêché of liège before the Austrian/Spanish lowland
Nicosia, I didnt know what I was expecting but it was definitely underwhelming
Ooooh
the amazing ribs from Meštiansky pivovar
yummy
Didn't try it
I also tried their grilled trout which was prepared with small pieces of bacon it was amazing as well
I don't think they would comment on it, even if they might not like it
They are paid to serve you the drink, not to comment on what you order
And if they would make such comments, they would probably loose many customers for their lack of respect for them
Now, however, instead of asking for the cheapest shot/beverage here, you would simply look at the menu and ask for the cheapest thing you saw on it
Asking to a server "the cheapest you have" would seem a bit weird, since usually, you take time to look on the menu before ordering anything
The only time you don't look the menu is to ask something generic you are sure they have : "a 33/pils", "a cola", "a coffee", "a glass of wine".
to add: since a 33'er is almost always the cheapest, putting up a pinky finger (belgian symbol for ordering a 33'er) is quite possibly synonymous with asking for the cheapest beverage
probably out of date, but when i was in school (about 20-15 years ago) it was: Ancient egypt and the fertile crescent (mostly focused on egypt), Ancient Greece, The Roman Empire (some sidenote mention of the celtic civilisations living here prior to incorporation in the roman empire
The quote "Fortisimi sunt Belgae" is guaruanteed mentioned in every textbook in Belgium)
In Dutch it is pronounced, you would say "Haa" but in flanders it's also common to hear something like "hash".
In my personal dialect I do drop the "h" in some words like "heel" (very" I would say "eel", certainly when speaking fast
Last one is not correct
We pronounce Y like ea in wear
If you spell it
It would be pronounced /ɛi/, è is a different sound
Monaco, because it is just a city full of tax evaders, and doesn't seem really interesting
Its global architecture isn't beautiful, and I can see better nature and towns in the part of France surrounding it, such as the "Parc naturel régional des Préalpes d'Azur" and the "Parc national du Mercantour". I don't feel attracted by Mediterranean French cities, smaller towns and villages that aren't on the coast are better : not overly touristic, not full of ugly apartment blocks
I would visit any other of the European countries
If you say Russia because of the government, shouldn't you also say Belarus and Turkey
>governments
I  could be wong, but I think Turkey is the only country that recognizes Northern Cyprus, so *technically* it's just government lol
Well, I'm sure you can find interesting or beautiful things in Monaco, but I wouldn't pay/travel specially to go there
I've always used Perpètes-les-bains, first time I hear about the geese variant
Another one in dutch (Belgium) is tsjakamakka, a made up name for an unknown place far away
We use a made-up name in Flanders (at least aroud Antwerp): **Chakamaka** or **Jacamaca**.
I think it's Timboektoe
In Belgian Dutch we also refer to 'Chakamaka' (Zjakkemakke, Jacamaca) which is a fictional place
The one time a Dutch tourist in Antwerp, sitting on a terrace with view on the 123 metres tall tower of the Cathedral of Our Lady gleefully said: "Oh, what a cute little church
It's only the highest building in the city, but she decided it was cute
> [Belgium is a beautiful city]
And while he's probably the most famous American to have said that, he's certainly not the only one I personally overheard saying that here
Was about to say that, like Iran and Syria were pretty modern
I like to point that out to racist people xp
Ah no the trans agenda uncovered
Yes it is I the transiest fry jumping out of your sunscreen
In Flanders it's also often played around Christmas
I've seen it a few times already
Seriously, that's a thing
That would sound so awkward to me
"Bonjour, Monsieur
-- Bonjour, comment puis-je vous aider ?
*ignoring whatever he just said*
-- I would like to order a coffee please"
Much less liberal than in the USA it seems, but still fair IMO
You can use deadly force to defend your or your loved ones' physical integrity
Only physical, you cannot attack or kill someone for trespassing, stealing or armed robbery
The danger to your physical integrity must be immediate, so in the process of happening or just about to happen
You can't shoot someone who's running away in the back
The thing is, because say, a person breaking in knows there are likely no guns anywhere
the person isn't going to bother with one
Just showing up is going to make them run because they don't want to be seen
Neighbors(butchery) got broken into, our back fence got forced open, etc
over recent years
The backdoor is still often open at night
I just don't fear burglars because they're after my stuff only and that's a nuisance, not a danger
By law it's just a case of "if your life is in danger do what you need to do to stay safe" with the caveat that if you can escape you fucking do so
If you're at your front door and you decide to to go and attack a burglar in your kitchen at the backdoor you're a moron
Shockingly human life here is valued over property damage
Something many Americans don't seem to grasp
You can also only use proportional force and this is very strict
If a knife is pulled on you you can't shoot him even if you have a legal firearm
As you said, when someone breaks in you can almost not harm that person since material belongings are less important than physical integrity (of yourself and the robber even) as long as he isn't threatening you physically
I doubt the court would accept shooting a fleeing suspect just because he stole your car as self-defence, basically anywhere
But IANAL either
I'm more likely to die in a car crash than to ever be in that situation so sorry for not exactly giving a shit
fair enough my dude, could do with some nicer language tough
I think there is just the local police for your arrondissement and the federal police for bigger matters
The Rijkswacht which is the same thing as Gendarmerie was reformed as a branch of the federal police a few decades ago because of internal issues
And for those curious about the "internal issues" that triggered this, it happened because the police and gendarmerie were competing rather than fully collaborating
This took a sour turn when Marc Dutroux kidnapped children
The gendarmerie suspected Dutroux but decided to do their own parallel inquiry rather than inform the judge
They fucked up big time, didn't find the two 8y/o girls hidden in a house they searched under a false pretense, and the girls later died of starvation
This blew up big and got us the reformed police
Not enough punishment for the involved gendarmes, if you ask me
Yes I know but there's a difference between military police and militarized police
Also, military police are sometimes seen escorting military transport
In that case, you have to listen to them same as civilian police
(For example telling you to stop, move aside, ...)
We don't use the noun 'boekstaaf' in Dutch anymore AFAI, but the verb 'boekstaven' still is
It's a very formal/literary synonym of "writing something down".
Well yes, because "Van den vos Reynaerde" was a direct translation of a French text called "le roman de Renart". It's even mentioned in the first paragraph of the Dutch poem, which was written down by a certain 'Willem' in the county of Flanders, back then the economic and cultural hub of the Low Countries:
>*Willem, die Madocke maecte,*
>*Daer hi dicken omme waecte,*
>*Hem vernoyde so haerde*
>*Dat die avonture van Reynaerde*
>*In dietsche onghemaket bleven*
"Willem, who made 'Madocke' (we don't really know what it means)
lay frequently awake at night,
he really regretted,
that the adventures/stories of Reynaerde,
were never written down in Dutch
" ("Dietsch" is an old word for "Nederlands")
>*Dat hi die vijte van Reynaerde dede soucken*
>*Ende hise na den walschen boucken*
>*In dietsche dus hevet begonnen
"He made \[people\] look for the holy life of Reynaerde
and according to the French books
(litt
"Walloon", but back then Walloon was almost a synonym for French
It originally meant foreigner, someone who doesn't the speak the common Germanic tongue
See 'Wales' or 'Wallachia')
he started it in Dutch
But in Dutch it's also 'adder' though
Figured as much
"een nadder" and "een adder" basically sound the same
I don’t get it, it’s not because the US is 300 years old that there’s only 300 years of history
Belgium is almost 200 years old but hell, our history classes start in the year 3500 BC
In the first year of high school, we learn about the prehistory
Second year: Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt
Third year: ‘early’ medieval times (500-1000)
Fourth year: ‘late’ medieval times (1000-1500)
Fifth year: ‘new times’ (1500-1830)
Sixth year: Belgian independence, world wars, cold war
Belgium is very much an artificial state and wasn't independent until 1830
We basically start by mentioning Gaul and its conquest by Caesar in the first century BC
Then there's a big gap where we focus on other more important empires in Europe and around 1700 we shift back to the low countries again
We get a quick run down at age 12 and further brake it down until age 18 with one age (exmp medieval age) a year
Simplify and skip a lot of portions that didn't really have an impact
By heart, I know we went over Leopold II, Franco, Robespierre, Louis XIV, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Lenin, Alexander The Great, Charlemagne, Tsar Nicholas and Rasputin, Napoleon, etc
We skip a lot my history teacher skipped the crusades and a lot of the cold war
Well, we don't really focus on Belgium, as it only started to exist in 1830
From 13yo to 18yo we focus on:
Year 1: early hominids to the first civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt
(Sorry India and China
Year 2: Indo Europeans migrating to different places in Europe, then Greek city states, Hellenist culture, Alexander the Great, the most important story beats of the Roman Empire up to the fall of the Western part
Year 3:Everything Middle Ages in our neighhborhood
The germanic tribes, gavelkind succession, the Karlings Merovingians, spread of Catholicism, farming practices, feudalism, the rise of cities
The crusades
Diseases
Year 4: New era
starts with the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire
Renaissance (buildings, paintings, sculptures
Luther and the Protestants
Reconquista
Exploration and colonisation
Inquisition
Some wars
Baroque ( recognize differences to Renaissance)
Year 5: enlightenment: philosophies
Nationalism More colonization
French revolution + Napoleanic wars
Belgium
Italy
Germany Industrial revolution
More Belgian politics
Marx
WW1
Year 6: interbellum WW2
Cold war (proxy wars)
Basically all major conflicts with the geopolitics behind it, some of which are still relevant today
And then some internal Belgian politics finally explaining wtf happened that we ended up this way
Fall of the USSR
Balkans
Iraq (the first time) 9/11 and the consequences it had
And then briefly on some conflicts that are still relevant (That was in 2015)
So tldr: everything necessary to understand current Belgian politics and current world conflicts
Belgium over 6 years
7th grade: Prehistory, Egypt(early, middle, late)
8th grade: the ancients, So Greece and Rome
9th grade: Post-Rome
Mainly focussed on the normal people
10th grade: Feudalism, France, England
11th grade: Napoleon + WW1
12th grade: WW2
And in between we cover the Aztecs and all that as 1 or 2 lessons
1st year of high school: we learned about everything that has to do with humans untill about 800 BC (Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia)
2nd year: 800 BC untill the fall of the Western Roman Empire (476 AD) We first learned about the Greeks, then about the Romans (and a little bit about the Celts)
3rd year: Middle Ages (476-1453) Charlemagne, christianity, (fall of) Byzantine Empire, Habsburg Netherlands, France and a ton of culture
4rd year: (1453-1750) mainly colonisation of America
Dutch Revolt, The Enlighment, humanism, and again a ton of culture (renaissance
5th year: (1750-1939) American and French revolution, South American Revolutions, colonisation of Africa, WW1, Unification of Germany and Italy, Belgian Revolution, Russia and the formation of the USSR, Interbellum
6th year (I'm currently in the 6th year): WW2, Cold War (and Vietnamese and Korean War), and then probably decolonisation of Africa and the fall of communism
*why do i see that many germans ?*
Wouldn’t happen for Belgium, they barely have power here
And on top of that the title of King is not even tied to the land in Belgium
His title is literally King of the Belgians, not King of Belgium, so his title isn't even historically tied to territorial claims
You start university at 17-18 years :
We have 12 school years, 6 of primary school, 6 of secondary school
You start primary school when you are 5-6, you end secondary school when you are 17-18
Do school years last 13 years in these other countries
Or manybe the explanation is that they start school later, such as 7 instead of 5-6
Yes, "only" 12 years
For Belgium, it is 6 of primary school, then 6 of secondary school (no such thing such as middle and high school here)
Secondary school is divided in two cycles : lower/inferior secondary school (years 1-2-3), and higher/superior secondary school (years 4-5-6)
The only difference between the two, is that the later has classes given by people with a university's master degree who had a postgraduate training to teach, while the teachers in the lower/inferior cycle went to a teaching high-school (high-school in Belgium is : a higher education school that gives your professionnal bachelor degrees; it's an alternative to universities (universities giving academic degrees))
I have no idea what "A-levels" are supposed to be
Hogeschool in English is college
No, it isn't. College doesn't even mean the same thing in the UK or the US
"College" isn't a word that fits Belgian education system
In our country, a college is a Catholic primary/secondary school, and high-school is vocational higher education
Hogeschool and American college are more or less equivalent, since they are both institutes of tertiary education that are not universities
So that's how I explain professionally what a hogeschool is to foreigners who are not familiar with the Flemish education system and it works quite well
The fact that some secondary schools have the title of college doesn't really matter
>or make illegal referendums
Imo that's kind of stupid to call these 'illegal'. The Spanish government will likely never give Catalonia a referendum, so it'll always be illegal
The flair cuts of at "since" on my phone and RiF so you're right to include it in your comment
>And in the day vote all anti independence citizens didn't vote because it was not considered a real one
So the results were heavily biased
Yeah I know and I don't consider the results legit either
I just think that Spain will never allow a referendum
Does not necessarely work
The states in Germany never had a very strong independence movement
The states in Belgium keep getting more seperated and more and more people want independence even though we have a lot of autonomy
I live in Antwerp (Antwerpen in Dutch),  which according to the myth  was named after a soldier who killed a giant,  and threw the giant's hand in the river ( throwing a hand = 'hand werpen',  which sounds a lot like 'Antwerpen')
I've heard other explanations too,  but those arent as interesting :P
[Here] is the story
"kortenberg" (short mountain)
...it's on a slight hill
additionally "Meerbeek" (LakeCreek)
..it has a lake, and some creeks
I live in Hoboken, district of Antwerp and thus the original Hoboken (looking at the US here)
Anyway, the name comes from 'Hoge Beuken' (English: high [beeches] which are trees that are really common here and can be quite tall
However, I prefer the version where a mayor dropped his "[boterham] and yelled "oh boke
". (We often call a 'boterham' a 'boke' near Antwerp
My city is called Louvain-la-Neuve, so literally "Leuven the new" in French
This is because in the 70s, French-speaking students were kicked out of the Leuven university (located in the Flemish speaking part of Belgium) so they decided to build the same university but in the French speaking part of our country
Around the university they built houses and shops and now it's a fully functional city with a lot of students
Turnhout
I was told it comes from the old germanic words "durnum" and "hulta" meaning thorn and wood/forest
So it means thorny forest
Another explanation is that "Turn" is another word for tower
So it means tower in the woods
My city in Belgium is called Oostende (~ East-end)
We used to be an island just in front of the shore
So as we were on the East-end of that island, there was also a city on the West-end (called Westende)
And on top of that there was a church in the middle between the 2 cities,  Middle-Church (called Middelkerke)
Throughout the years they started to fill up the space between shore and our land, which resulted in Oostende becoming the city at the beach
I've learned the story this way but could never back it up with results online
So yeah
I live in a small village called Zedelgem, formarly in our dialect known as Zilleghem
It has two parts 'Zedel/Zille' comes from one of the many medieval words for swamp 'zele' and the second part 'gem/ghem' is widely used throughout germanic speaking countries (like 'heim' in germany) for a place where people live together
Well there was Village A, it was ideally suited for trade and was called Turnhout, but it belonged to a knightly order so people had to pay extra tax for that which people didn't like
So in comes village B, that's "free" and right next to it so all trade goes through there
Then they had to find a name so they named themselves Turnhout to make it easier for traders
And eventually turns into s city
But wait
Village A is also called Turnhout, so what's with that
Well
Now it's called Oud-Turnhout (old Turnhout)
Turnhout comes from the Germanic turn or torn (torn trees) and hout comes from forest
This was actually very interesting to find out, thanks for the question
My town is called Ieper, which is derived from the small river it was built on, the Ieperlee
The Ieperlee takes its name from old Dutch where it means something like stream bordered by Iepen (a type of tree)
Ravels, it comes from Ravenbos which means something like Ravenwood
The area around here used to be popular hunting grounds for nobles a long time ago and the next town has its name from eagles
Falconing was a big thing here and you can still do it im a few places
My town is called 'Kortrijk' and at first sight it looks like it's a compound of the Dutch words 'kort' (short) and 'rijk' (realm)
There's a folktale about how a young man was offered a plot of land by his liege lord to found a new town, but only under one condition: the boundaries of this new town would be determined by how far the young man's horse could run continuously without stopping
The horse, however, was quite old and tired and after only a short while the horse slowed down, collapsed on the ground and died of exhaustion
And that's how the young man's realm was quite short
The real etymology is not as exciting, but still interesting
It goes back to the Gallo-Roman word 'Cortoriacum', but the exact meaning is unknown
There are also a few other towns nearby with names of Gallo-Roman origin like Wervik (Viroviacum) and Doornik/Tournai (Tornacum), which is quite exceptional, since almost all other town and village names in the area are of Germanic origin
Using the city I was born instead of live
It's now named Eeklo but used to be called eikenlo
"Eik" is dutch for "oak".
Basically we had a lot of oaks and it became a rather wealthy town because of it's location, a day's travel away from Ghent and Brugge
The city's name in Dutch is Keulen (pronounced as 'Köhlen' in German), so you can see where it branched off from the High German version
For people who want the boring story: Antwerp is right next to the river Scheldt and as it happens to be right next to a big curve in said river
In such a curve of a big river lots of silt gets pushed into that curve
In old Dutch they thus called it "aenwerp", wich is what they called the naturaly raised ground that was "thrown" (worpen/werpen) there by the river
'Antwerpen' thus comes from 'aenwerpen' where the first setlements of the city came to be, near the "aangeworpen grond" (thrown in ground)
The original 'aenwerpen' were near the small castle called " 't Steen" but have been gone since the end of the 19th century, when we build the warfs at 't Scheldt
Dude that's hilarious lmfao
>s‑Gravenhage (known as The Hague in English)
First time I heard that name as a Belgian
We just say 'Den Haag'.
Interesting story though
Milan is pig city,  aight I'll remember that :P
Turn it around and you get Leuven
Hoboken New Jersey, iirc
I didn't went into details but further down the tread I started [I already mentioned that]
Thanks for the more thorough explanation though
It is still interesting
shit, you're right
this is splendid trivia
Yeah I looked it up
It had a really similar name but then flemish people emmigrated to there and renamed it to Hoboken
They "ronronnent", so it's *ron-ron*. (with French pronunciation of "on")
There are 3 languages in my country, but the Flemish AKA Dutch speaking people tend to say 'miauw'. The verb would be 'miauwen'.
I'm not sure if it's dialect though
The public universities: Brussel, Gent, Leuven, Hasselt, Antwerpen, Louvain-La-Neuve, Liège, Namur
Edit: and Mons and maybe another one that I forgot
The royal military academy
The University of Leuven
It's one of the oldest in the world
I can't tell you, why it is the best but I have a little fun fact about it
Maybe some of you know, that Belgium is divided by the language conflict between Walloons and Flanders
Or much simpler: the frenchspeaking part and the dutchspeaking part
Because of its location in Flanders that's about 30-50 km away from Wallonia, there where a lot of Frenchspeakers
In the 20th century the Walloons were thrown out and dislocated in the South
A new frenchspeaking City (Louvain-La-Neuve) was build including a new University
But here comes the crazy part: As the new University had no books, the library of Leuven was split in half
So for example: Leuven gets the books that start with "A", L-L-N gets the books that start with "B", and so on
I think that's one of the craziest stories in the history of the Wallonia-Flanders conflict
uGent and KU Leuven are both in the list of top 100 best universities in the world
Don't forget Mons
De kludde, he lives in Wichelen
He basically eats humans
There are Frogmen near where my parent live :
["Nekker" or "Nikker" in Flemish
Distances
I used to think Los Angeles and San Francisco were pretty much neighbouring cities the way people in movies talk how they're close together, but according to google it's a 6 hour drive
&#x200B;
To put that in perspective
You can drive from Bruges (at the North Sea coast, inbefore  Zeebruges) to Arlon (in the most Southern part near the Luxembourg border) in half that time
I wonder how other European people from larger countries experience that, because Paris-Marseille is even further apart
(**7 h 52 min** (776
3 km) via A6 and A7) or Bilbao - Malaga ( **8 h 41 min** (920
3 km) via A-4 )
&#x200B;
But I guess that's nothing compared to Oslo - Tromso :o
&#x200B;
Or Kalingrad - Vladivostok
Must be fun for football fans, because Baltika Kaliningrad and FC Luch Vladivostoka are in the same league :o
Same where would you be able to drive like that here
Belgians would just start talking to you in English, as soon as they notice you are a foreigner
I'm not sure if asking for the standard dialect would work out here, as many people who speak a regional dialect are rather convinced they actually speak the standard dialect
No dialect in French, everybody speaks a local variation of standard French
So, there is no "switching of dialect" possible
One European traffic system with the use of symbols instead of language
Once abroad, many people don't understand what traffic signs displays
A degree (secondary school -> university)
In Belgium the traffic rules aren't even the same for the whole country
On the 'gewest'roads, you can drive up to 70km/h in Flanders but 90km/h in Wallonia and Brussels
It's especially annoying for tourist, because why would there be different traffic rules in the same country
I'm fine with text as long as it's non-critical
Like a symbol sign telling you access denied - and the sub-sign reads in text "except for cyclists
If you don't know how to read the text as a cyclist, you can still fall back on the regular sign and find a way around like car drivers do
You won't be able to take the shortcut, but you're not directly endangering yourself by taking another way either
Yes, and that's not my point
My point is that **I** would support that a degree (not *any* degree) for a specific study in country A should have the same value as that degree in country B. And I'm not specifically talking about university degrees, but degrees from secondary school degrees to university master degrees
Maybe that's for the best haha
It's not like we have one too
It's fine, though I don't know what the end mean (also I may try to make the poffertjes at home)
Curryworst or frikandel
The "Curryworst" vs ["Frikandel"] (the actual correct name) vs "Lange Hamburger"  and the ["Frikadel"] (the correct one) vs "Frika**n**del" (just wrong) vs "Boulet" (acceptable) vs "Gehaktbal (meatballs)" (a general term, also correct) problem
Because the camps are mostly regional divided, conflict remains minimal
But ordering in a fritterie in region you're not from can lead to a lot of confusion
French speaking part VS Dutch speaking part
I don't think anyone beats that
The Flemish Belgian "rock paper scissor" divide
[So you have folks who say "blad steen schaar" (green: leaf rock scissor) and you have people who say it as god intended: Schaar steen papier (orange: scissor stone paper)
While the greens are bigger in area, orange is the most densely populated part of Belgium including the biggest cities and orange also has the big advantage of being correct
I'm still not sure if there are actually people who like raisins
Surely, they must exist, since we can find such things in stores, but I don't recall ever meeting one
^(I actually prefer the raisin buns
I have a French Canadian friend
She's disgusting
She keeps saying the c-word
In some places in Belgium, it's "couque au chocolat".
Patat
PATAT
It's FRIET
If you have 2 of the 4 main ingredients of mayonnaise, why not just make mayonnaise
Buy an egg, buy some moustard
of lange hamburger
I've never heard anyone call it curryworst, that must be a Flemish thing
I would say: Fricandelle or Fricadelle
Frikadellekes are meatballs, the long meatstick is ne currywust
The meatball from the frituur is een boulèt.
I do
It's "friet". Ne patat is something you pull out the ground
Both words refer to the same thing
However, people call it differently in parts of the country
The debate is about which one is the right word for the snack
Yeah it's mainly a Flemish thing
Fricandelle is a meatball to me, or at least the bastardized dialect word frikadel / frikadelle(kes)
We say that as dialect for ice cream around these parts tho
> I think couque is belge
It is, but not even from everywhere in Belgium
Only in Brussels and in Hainaut
In Namur, Liège or Luxembourg it is pain au chocolat
Niet in België. Vreemd hoe het onderscheid zo duidelijk is in België en zo 'controversieel' in Nederland

Hold on now
As a Belgian it is my god-given right to have a voice in anything fry-related
That and waffles
Klinkt logisch hahah
[Vinkensport] A chaffinch bird is put into a little cage

Not in this period of your country's history
Is this always or because of the pandemic
Szczecin comes pretty close though
Maybe it's just me but I aways feel like spelling makes more sense in Slavic languages that use Cyrillic
Wow, that's harsh
Given that prohibition usually doesn't do much I doubt you Norwegians drink less because of this rule
Here in Belgium stores aren't allowed to sell any alcohol after 8PM, but that's just because of the pandemic
And people already lose their shit over it
Please don't tell the Germans
Ireland
I've been visiting there with my mum every year for ten years, except last year of course
I love it there
Beautiful nature and coastline, cosy towns, friendly people, yummy food, all the music on the street
Their accent sounds so cool too and I wish I could talk like that
I'd love to just go live there to be honest
Could you link some of that Czech music
I'm trying to create a playlist full of European music and any help is welcome haha (others are of course also welcome to chime in)
The Netherlands
Everyone is so happy over there
(Well, except when they are not) I have never found a country that just clicks with me as well as the Netherlands
I can't learn the language because it is already my mother tongue
However I also love the Swedish language so I am learning that
Switzerland (german part), I just love the Alps, the language, the houses
I just want to live in the mountains, have some animals and do some gardening
Same here
I also only visited it twice but those were the best vacations ever
Such a beautiful place
The UK is a very overhyped country
I don't know why so many are in love with it to the point where it can only let you down
You're half/half
That's a combo I have never imagined, but sounds so cool
I know some Poles and it's hard to imagine my image of Poles and Mexicans combined
So you're chill (my idea of Mexican) but also complain a lot (all the Poles I know)
Awesome thanks
I can send it to you already if you want, it's sort of an eternal work in progress haha
I'm pretty ambitious with it
Right now I'm at about 1400 songs but it's still waaaay too focussed on western Europe for my liking
So if you'd ever feel like overloading me with a whole bunch more, well known or less well known, I definitely won't say no :)
The end-idea is to make something that celebrates the musical diversity of Europe as well as just European music in general so anything is welcome really
See it as the sound of a continent all rolled into one list
Haha cool
My son is half Belgian, half Taiwanese, also not a usual mix I think
That is also a thing in Belgium and Spain, AFAIK
(with the exception of football)
European all the way

In my eyes, this is only about administration

I've never even had to show my passport travelling between European countries
That
Is also acceptable ;)
I included it
But used Google translate
Thanks
I used Google translate, so
Thanks
And no problem
Hope you can end it well or have a good one tomorrow ️ I'm studying at the moment and it's frustrating me out, so I can relate
Okay but Switzerland isn't in the EU, so I understand that
But even then, I didn't have any border control driving into Switzerland coming from France
Yeah
I used a list of all the languages I found on the net
Meh :) I think it's natural people want to correct it
As long as they don't act like dicks, as they don't, I'm okay with it
And thanks
It was a welcome break from studying today
That's a good point
;-)
Yes, and it's the reason for the "ye Olde ...shop" trope
The "y" is actually the letter thorne and is pronounced "th"
Ha didn't know that
In Dutch we have neither so not 100% familiar with the use :)
Filip Dewinter
Organised a 'Islam safari' though muslim neighbourhoods
That's Belgian extreme right for you
Also Leon Degrelle who was a collabo who was at some point considered as the nephew of hitler
He escaped in Spain after the war and remained there till his death
We didn't want him back
Alive or dead
A lot of Flemish people love Dewinter though
Yeah, the closed minded xenophobic muslim haters do
Not exactly a politician I would argue
Don't know, for me politicians kind of implies being voted or elected in some way, though that seems a bit of a narrow view by me
What about Sarkozy
Didn't he fall completely out of grace after the 2012 election
With all the scandals, all the corruption that was exposed
Still, I think the king back then was much more involved in poltics than today
He's somewhere in between
But still, what he did was horrible, and 10 million Congolese people died during the Belgian supremacy
Leopold II was pretty much one of the reasons todays Kings are not able to be as involved in politics, though the biggest reason remains Leopold III
In Flanders it depends where u are
There has been multiple polls and even a map in r/Belgium that shows where people say what for "rock paper scizzors". And the comment section became somewhat hostile between people who used a different version
To put it simply, these are the 3 main ones used
Blad Steen Schaar (Paper/Leaf Rock Scizzors): used by the most people
Schaar Steen Papier (Scizzors Rock Paper): used mostly by people from Antwerpen Province and Vlaams-Brabant Province
Steen Papier Schaar (Rock Paper Scizzors): used by people who live very close to Dutch borders, so probably mostly the Province Limburg
we just use the standard, but in east flanders we say paper, rock, paper scissors, instead of rock paper scissors
Yeah same here
Do you call it steen papier schaar
I've always called it schaar steen papier and I've heard it being called blad steen schaar, but never another order
This whole thread hurt my brain lmao
Blad might be better translated to 'sheet' in this case
A "blad papier" is a "sheet of paper".
I always thought it was "blad steen schaar" in Flemish and "schaar steen papier" in Dutch Dutch
Good question, we don't even know why lol, btw if u scroll up there is a comment where Dutchies and Belgians are discussing the differences as well as a map with the regions where they use what version lol
We just have a lot of dialects and languages
The flemish region alone has: Limburgish (classified as a seperate language outside of Belgium), West-flemish (also classified as a seperate language outside of Belgium), East-Flemish and Brabantian
And many cities have there own regional variants
Antwerp has the Antwerp dialect which is a version of Brabantian but totally different from someone from Vlaams-Brabant
Aalst lies in Oost-Vlaanderen but its dialect leans more to Brabantian than East-Flemish
And many many more examples akd  the same goes for the Walloon region
And you think steen papier schaar sounds good
It's as bad as saying patat to frieten
[A map of the naming of the game]
Only Brabant-related dialects/regions use (the superior) Schaar-steen-papier
Both schaar steen papier and steen papier schaar sound so ugly to my ears, and unnatural, blad steen schaar FTW
Steen papier schaar sounds terrible
> blad steen papier
It's blad steen schaar
The "blad" in that version is "a page" of paper
According to this map I live in the blad steen schaar area but I say schaar steen papier
But I live just outside the schaar steen papier area
In Flemish I've always played schaar steen papier, bur in French we play it Pierre papier ssizoo
That's where you're wrong
Well, it only shows where one is a majority over the other
Same, but the opposite
Patat is plural WHAT
Yeah
I heard schaar steen papier way more but that might've been different at other schools in my city
Weird probably in the Netherlands it is only used like that, we really do say Frieten or Patatten as plural
I’m sorry but that’s wrong on so many levels to me ahahah
You can't compare the per-person cost of a family of four to a single person, it's a lot cheaper to cook for four (per person) than for one
Also kids generally eat less

These are the same people that claimed Obamacare included "death panels" where doctors decided whether or not you'd be allowed to live or instantly killed
They know what they're saying is BS, and yet their voters gobbled it up
Why would they stop now

I'd know where I want to live in this overgeneralised world of US conservatives
If you have a (semi)permanent residence, which means you're paying taxes, yes, I think you should get a vote on how your taxes are being spent
I'm not sure this is practically feasible however, since the voting systems differ from country to country
Here in Belgium for example you have compulsory voting, and as far as I know doesn't really have a registration system
I think that if you lived here for a long enough time (say 5 years so you can also apply for citizenship) you should be able to vote, but only if you show that you are commited to the country you live in by at least showing you want citizenship
So assume you can only apply for citizenship if you are in said country for over 5 years, have a place stay, have a job with at least a  minimum wage and speak one of the official languages
I think you should be able to vote if you are in the country long enough, 2 out of the 3 other requirements are met and have proof that you are working on the 3rd
On the other hand, I don't think that you should still be able to vote in a country that you don't live in
(I that's why Turkey still has Erdoğan and partially why Hungary has Orbán.)  If you return to a country I think you should again live there for 5 years (or less depending on how long ypu were gone) before you should be able to vote
Same in Belgium
My grandfather has been living in Belgium for more than 90 years but he has ever just voted for the communes since he has the citizenship from Luxembourg
In the latter part you make it sound like it wasn't even that bad
If I may give you a word of advice: if you want to quote sources to counter someone elses statement, don't use wikipedia as your source

I flew to Madrid from Belgium last week
Didn't ever need to show my ID to get to the gate, and on arrival I never had to show my ID either
This was for both ways
Ticket with a Shengen destination was all the documentation that was needed to get to where I wanted to be
There is no slow down, there are no controls or roadblocks and it doesn't affect me
It's probably like going from one city to another in other countries
The only thing that might affect me is that other countries use a different language, different signs and different traffic rules
No slow downs, no controls
Just a sign next to the road that says *welcome in [country]*. If you’re from the USA: it’s the same like crossing the border of 2 states
I often end up in the Netherlands on accident when I go biking with my family in the weekends
As a passenger in a car and not looking out the first sign tend to be a message on the phone welcoming you
Easy as hell
Only rarely will you be checked when crossing a border in the Schengen area
It's crazy that in 100 years we went from having to be stopped by world powers from invading each other, we went to establishing the Benelux and all that came with it
Belgium is right in between France, the UK and Germany and therefor gets a lot of trucks from all over Europe all going trough our small country
Some stick to the main highways that are made to endure heavy loads, others don't give a shit where they go and constantly wreck our smaller roads
Therefor a large part of the buget goes to making repairs that could have been avoided and other roads that are also in desperate nead of replacement pay the cost
Also the fact that our government doesn't know how to handle money
I stopped getting these a couple of years ago
Do you still get them then
It varies from airline to airline, (or maybe destination), but in theory you shouldn't have to show your ID at any time when travelling inbetween Schengen airports
In practice sometimes they still ask it upon boarding to verify that you are the owner of the ticket, but I've had flights where I never had to take my ID out
As for the UK, their rules don't really apply, since the UK was never Schengen
Nope
Brussels -> Barcelona and back here for a fair for work
Could have left any identification at home technically
(still had my ID and driver's license with me of course)
By law any identification would suffice, not just your ID, but in practise I wouldn't try annoying the staff
Yeah as I said in the last part of my comment: the government doesn't really know how to spend money
Long text messages or text messages with images count as MMSs
I end up sending some every now and then
In the past when we still got them it was super annoying
We lived really close to the border so we got them just by moving within our home
You were correct
Because of the amount of traffic, national and international, Belgian roads not only wear down faster, but we have a lot more of them than other countries, despite being smaller
This means we can afford less money per road
That's why even the less busy roads are usually in poor shape
I'm sceptical Dutch administration would be able to make much of a difference
Right we indeed do have an insane amount of roads compared to other countries
Didn't even think about that part yet

The bright red colour of the Austrian flag and the cable car that is hanging in the distance make this one of my favorite pictures

I'm interested to hear what a strange town name is to a Dutchman
We do have dumb town names
One town is called “Buitenland” translate to ‘abroad’

I'll have you know we have 6 goverments thank you very much
Just one of them is currently in running affairs
I don't know how we continue functioning either
That’s the beauty of having an unnecessary amount of governments, when one or 2 break down you still have some to spare

Glad Michael Palin said it, bless his heart
To be fair, we have many, many governments
When one gets stuck, the other governments and the civil servants take care of business
Not an ideal situation, but it kind of works
Like 90% of Flemish seperatists would rather be part of Belgium than join the Netherlands
Wallonia is similar and the guys from Brussels would just create a city state
Maybe we should split, but are neither Dutch or French
What's weird about our beer
That’s hilarious I love it actually
Well yes but after that we split up from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands because the Catholics (Belgians) were fed up with being looked down upon by the Protestant north
I mean, did we ever really function in the first place

These are regions where they speak these languages
Just because the name of the language refers to a nationality doesn't mean they are solely spoken by that nationality
These languages originate from Belgium just as much as they do from France and the Netherlands
On a federal level we are once again stuck in long drawn out formation period
However the trains will keep riding, schools will remain open and every government institution will keep running
The impasse will have zero impact on everyday life
You have to keep in mind though that a lot of Belgians commenting have their own political perspective
The country is in many ways split
The fissure runs along the language border
Many on the Flemish side and some on the Walloon side want a permanent separation and some of them will insist the country is not working at all and is run worse than a banana republic
This in my opinion is an exaggeration used only to score political points
I don't see the country splitting any time soon though
As Flemish and Walloon tend to ignore the elephant in the room called Brussels
Still 1,3 million people in a country of 11 million
Next to the port of Antwerp, Brussels is also one of economic heavyweights of Belgium

Cash me outside, how bout that
You already got our spot in the cup
Hmmm I'd say those are interchangeable, I use both about as often
To be fair Flemish is more accurate since the Dutch need subtitles to understand most of us
Hmm, okay, fair enough
But you forgot your Bicky
Lol don't talk about things you don't know anything about
These are group names for the dialects of Dutch and French spoken in these regions
There is no such thing as Flemish, each village has their own dialect
We have a different accent and use some other words compared to the Netherlands but even within Flemish provinces it varies
You wouldn't say American is a language either
I don't understand West-Flemish either
I'm just making up for the Brits Leaving the EU
So if you can't handle that: CASH ME OUTSIDE, HOW BOUT THAT
Walloon is its own language though
Walloon absolutely was its own language before they were frenchified
You don't seem *that* informed either
I do but I live in Gent

No idea but we're on the receiving end of several countries
In Belgium, we male joke jokes about how the french are swaggers and in return they makes jokes about how we are stupid
The Netherlands, with the dumb Dutchman
Edit: forgot the jokes about the Walloons
France and Flemish
Dutch, French and Italian people
They are so goddamn loud
And Dutch people are everywhere
I saw more Dutch than French people in France
People in Flanders make fun of the Netherlands and in Walonia they make fun of France
(Both make up Belgium)
In Wallonia, we make jokes about French people being arrogant/disdainful/haughty
We joke a lot aboit the Netherlands
Love you Netherlands
Ah yes, make jokes about the Belgians who speak French to you French people while you respond in your "perfect" English :)
That's awfully ironic in a historic sense

The plane commander said « the plane is too heavy throws things »
Then the Turk throwed Kebab, cuz there is too much kebab in his country
Then the Belgian throwed « French » Fries cuz there was too much of these in Belgium
Then, that’s the joke everyone maked in my 12 years of school,it’s not my joke,and i’m not saying it’s true
The Dutch throwed the Turk, because there was too much Turks in his country
Plz it’s not my joke don’t kill me
>I don't remember any jokes about Turkish stereotypes or the country of Turkey, though
Why should you never run over a Turk on a bike with your car
Could be your bike
An American a French and a Turk are in a plane
The American put his hand out of the plane and tell the 2 other passengers that they are in America
The French and the Turk ask him how he know and the American say that he touched the Liberty Statue
The French does the same and tell them they are in France
The other ask him how he know and he say that he touched the Eiffel tower
Then the Turk stick his hand out of the plane and proudly say that they are in Turkey
The other ask him how he know and he tell them that someone stole his watch
Don't worry the Luxembourgish province like you the most
Luxembourg will always be our favorite brother don't worry
They could have copied too
A government
What's that
Why would we copy what France claims is their stereotype for us *for you*?
Bruh this is inaccurate
We did 500 days once, honour us god damn it
Why can’t it be NL that wants to throw it back at us
Or the French that throw it back at us
Your arguments make no sense
Not to worry, we're currently working on it again ^^
The French don’t joke about NL
I meant they want to throw back a stereotype we directed at them to us
I don’t understand what you were trying to say there, but doesn’t mind
I’m trying to say that there’s no way to know who started with the jokes
Go ahead and research it, then
Nah I have better things to spend my time on
I was not, I’m saying that you cannot just know who was first
The Netherlands wasn’t always the richest of the two, so that doesn’t prove a lot
Maybe joking about NL has been a way for Belgians to distant themselves more and more from NL
So moral of the story: as I’ve said the entire time: we don’t know who was first and will probably never know
True, but that doesn’t make us know who was first
The Belgians wanted independence so they could perfectly have started it too according to this fact you gave here
I didn’t find anything about the jokes on the internet, so nope: we still don’t know
What the fuck is a meertens Instituut even

I'm too lazy to get out of the couch to start the heating and once I'll put it on, I'll have to get out of the couch in 5-10min to turn it off again because it heats up a bit too quickly
On top of that I'm going to bed in half an hour (or at least that's what I tell myself, reality might turn out very differently) so I feel like starting to heat the living room right now is a bit of a waste
Yup same in Belgium everyone wears their jacket in class
I’ve never heard of such laws

I would call yours super duper cold too :p
Thanks for your reply
Interesting they didn't let go of the law once the scarcity had diminished
Here, we had car free Sundays to conserve oil, but they were reduced significantly over time as more oil became available again
Now we only have one car free Sunday a year iirc, more out of nostagia than anything else
And then we get to bike and skate in what are normally really busy streets, so that's fun too
They had a referendum once or I think maybe even twice, but the people voted no
Norway is doing good without the EU and they would have to make quite a lot of changes in their laws to join, so I can see why they don’t want to
The EU and Norway also have a very good relationship, so there are benefits for both Norway and EU-countries without Norway being part of the EU

Last time it happened in what is now Belgium was in 1666, with Charleroi
It happened because far-righters and far-right youth movements from Dutch-speaking Belgium expelled the French-speakers from Leuven and its university, an event known as the "*Walen Buiten*". So, the French-speaking teachers and students of said university had no place to teach and study anymore, and it was decided that a new city would be built to host them, the university's building and the campus
I know it's commonplace in francophone Belgium to continuously depict anything that's related to the Flemish movement and Flemish nationalism as far-right, but the fact remains that without it Dutch (or its dialects) would never have been made an official language in Belgium nor have remained the majority language in Flanders
They had to fight tooth and nail for every piece of language legislation, because the French speaking bourgeoisie were not doing it out of goodness of their own heart
I wish Leuven Vlaams/Walen buiten could have been approached more gracefully, but it seems to me that francophones don't understand why it happened in the first place or think the Flemish were just being difficult
The language border had just been made official a few years prior, something many French speakers didn't accept for a long time, and Leuven was part of the Dutch speaking area
However, there was still a large section of the University of Leuven that was French speaking and a lot of Dutch speakers (rightly) feared that Leuven would become majority French speaking like Brussels
Many francophones never took these fears seriously and some of them even ridiculed them (e.g. Université de Houte-si-Plou)
When later plans were announced to expand the French section in Leuven and to create a sort of corridor between Leuven and Brussels, tensions came to a boiling point and Leuven Vlaams/Walen buiten was the sad result of that
It's important that francophones realise that they weren't just the defenseless victims in this whole debacle
They enjoyed many privileges back then and when these were taken away, they felt attacked
There was never a Dutch speaking university in Wallonia and you can rest assured that they would have never allowed it
The UK has the Tolkien Estate , Belgium has Moulinsart, to handle, manage and protect the property and rights related to Tolkien and Hergé's (Tintin) works/opi
Does your country has a simular institution that has a monopoly on a writer's work which considered a national marvel/treasure
Hello people,
So, these two bodies/companies have near exclusive rights to the works of their respective writer
Meaning : they decide what can be published, who can do it, they handle the rights and copyrights related to what Tolkien or Hergé wrote
In summary, they have a kind of monopoly on their opi, and you can't do anything Tolkien or Tintin/Hergé related without their approval (may it be movies, books, t-shirts, mugs, toys etcs
I don't know for the Tolkien Estate, but Moulinsart is particularly aggressive in that regard
For example, an artist called *Un faux graphiste* ("a fake graphic designer"), who was posting on Facebook, had to shut down his page because his work consisted mostly of Tintin's strips and pages, in which he had modified the texts in the speech bubbles
His work was humourous, absurd reinterpretation of what happened in the strip or page
He made no money from it, got no profit
But Moulinsart did "attack" him legally, and he had to delete everything
So, does your country has something similar
Is there a major writer/literary work that is "protected" by a company/legal body that has a monopoly on it and controls what can or can't be done with it
Yeah, I mean specifically what he wrote and his world
Not about the creatures that aren't his inventions
The only onces I can think of right now are:
Room (meaning: cream)
Of (meaning: or)
Edit: this is in Dutch
In West Flemish (a Dutch dialect) we have these tshirts/sweaters with: “west flemish for behinners”.
They have sentences like:
“Awesome means breath”
“Hail means horny”
“Hot means god”
“Honey means don’t go”
“Dust means thirsty”
“Tit means time”
French:
pain = bread
demand = to ask, neutrally
con = idiot
bite = slang word for a dick (the male genitals)
&#x200B;
Dutch:
pet = a cap
lol = fun
Literally
"lol hebben" means to have fun
Go visit the Big Cities
There are nearly no locals left, so nearly impossible to annoy them
I'm in Poland right now, and I've been conflicted in whether I should tip, and how much, because the service is excellent but I don't want to come across as exactly like was described
I'm not currently in one, but my ex was Russian and I'm Belgian
Surprisingly, there were very few cultural differences
The biggest differences between us were class differences as she was rich and I'm rather poor
There was however one big cultural shock for her
We could walk in the street and hold hands and no one gave a fuck
In Russia, there's so much homophobia that she just couldn't do that with her ex, or at least not without getting harassed
Other than that, no big differences, or at least nothing I would consider to be cultural differences
Bidet
Three
That for birthdays
Well I don't really know, it was her experience as she told me
I wouldn't be able to ask her anymore, unfortunately
Maybe it was because her ex was butch, I don't know
All I know is she felt general hostility from the people she saw
I don't know who you are but generally, oppression is easier to see when you're the one being oppressed, maybe that's why you don't see it
(but idk)
Yeah, I'd say so
I'm sure other people may have different experiences, especially since I was only ever with her in big cities, but overall, I generally wouldn't be afraid
Maybe it's different for men, tho, I couldn't say
Really
We learned at school last year that a lot of schools in the UK are single sex
> share everything
A true Communist
Here in Belgium you are allowed to switch lunch and dinner
belgium as well
one of the dishes is a sandwich and the other is the warm one
you can switch or do exception every now and then (no big deal) but that's how it usually works
That's also true for us
Probably a small house in my province (Brabant wallon), and either a very small house or a nice flat in Brussels region
But if I go elsewhere in French-speaking Belgium, I could buy a quite nice house with that money, if not a big house
Small Belgian village
You could afford a nice house, nothing extraordinary but reasonable big and nice
[Here's a link to an example] 3 bedrooms, 246 m², €395 000
It's a bit old but I just looked it up because I don't really have an idea(wealthy background)
[With all taxes and such it's going to cost you more than 400k but close enough
Bought 2 buildings for 500k+ a piece but they're still under construction
One is a decent sized apartment and the other is a home that's a lot smaller than the one here
So yea, a new house that's separate is going to cost you 500k easily
Really that expensive there
In Flanders, as long as you're not in or very close to Bruges, Ghent or Antwerp, you'd definitely get a nice newly built house for that money, size depending on location
Where I live it would definitely be a pretty nice one
Brabant and Brussels are very expensive yes
You can have a house for that price sure, but much smaller than what you would have in the rest of Wallonia with the same amount of money
I'm from Antwerp: generally you want to avoid most of the restaurants in the historical centre, especially those that hail you in and have pictures of foods etc, the usual thing
HOWEVER there are actually some very good restaurants there too with nice and cozy terraces / views, but they tend to be more hidden from sight and only known by locals
I think it's ok to check on Tripadvisor and google reviews
last I checked those they seemed accurate & honest
(even tho I know sometimes restaurants do scummy things in tripadvisor)
I consider pretty much entire Bruges to be a tourist trap
It's probably still worth going but as far as I know everything there in the centre is overpriced and catered to tourists
For entire belgium: avoid shops that loudly advertise 'belgian beers' or 'belgian chocolates', if you want either of those to take with you, you go to a specialty drinks store (like Drankgigant) for beers, or to a well reviewed bakery/chocolaterie for chocolates
Which is the street
That makes sense, I always thought of it as lovely ruling animal
Well if we're going on that route, a calf is someone who does stupid things ("stom kalf")
We pretty much all write in English, hell even r/belgium is pretty much entirely English
Rarely you'll get Dutch/French postst or comments
In /r/Belgium we usually posts translations of articles in anything non-english (Dutch/French/German) via deepl
com
The primary language is English so everyone can understand one another
But NL/FR/DE is always open
But you don't want to see the beautiful mess of language that is /r/BELGICA
/r/Belgium is mostly English because of the two language communities, although you see Dutch being used relatively often
Yes, dutch posts are so rare
r/BELGICA is peak belgian performance
Ok, that's awful
I never bothered to learn English(study it) but people were surprised I wasn't from Britain when I was talking over Ventrillo when I was 16 playing world of warcraft
I remember being 6 or so and having trouble playing pokemon yellow because of my lack of English though but back then I was only listening to dutch music of course
I had an American friend by the time I was 8 playing in the swimming pool in France
we also have r/wallonia that is in French and some time in Wallon
I love it
I genuinely love r/BELGICA
Yeah it's not common, but it's one of the official languages
They even have their own parliament and representation in the federal
But yeah it's a couple of villages, yet I had to take two years of German in school because of that
Die
Niemals xD
My sister had an English teacher who thought she lived in the UK bc she learned English from watching the Young Ones and TomSka with me
Also our unhealthy obsession with the Sex Pistols did help haha
As someone from the other side of the language border; I've never heard real Wallon, come to think of it
>~~It's beautiful lol~~
Das est prachtig
Well nowadays it's very rare to hear someone speak Wallon because it was forbidden to learn it at school
There are some politician who want to reintroduce it but they can't decide which form to take
Hahaha all is forgiven
Now I can enjoy r/ich_iel
and nobody can figure out what's going on in West-Flemish
Oedje mulle
I am always confused when playing rainbow six siege
You get a message 'the target is on the first floor', so I run up the stairs with my hard breacher, to disapproving looks of my team
In belgium: begane grond= gelijkvloers
Everybody so fucking flexing and where here just with body mas index and fries
It might seem rather insignificant, but we invented the saxophone
We also invented the saxophone and the contraceptive pill
I think you forgot about plastic
We invented the saxophone and the Mercator projection
Never heard of this
Weren't the Dutch first with stock exchange
Shit I forgot
Belgians are the inventors/discovers of (or involved in the process of doing so) in a surprisingly large amount of things in chemical and medical fields, considering how small our country is
Baekeland made the first fully synthetic plastic while working in the USA
Solvay discovered the process that's used to produce three quarters of the world's sodium carbonate
And institutes like the *Institute of Tropical Medicine* in Antwerp are known around the globe and played a major role in research of HIV and Ebola
Thanks bud
Yeah we produce SCARS which Belgians can obviously not use so they sell it to Not very ethical clients
Fuck you kaasvreter
That is cultural appropriation
The first stock exchange is in Antwerp I believe
It has recently finished restoration
Why not
I think we produce P90s aswell
Jazeker en zo hebben julie iedereen GEKOLONISEERD
I'm not fluent in Italian, but doesn't it say in here that the word "borsa" is derived from the "ter Beurze" building in Brughes
> Il termine "Borsa" deriva dalle riunioni per determinare il valore delle merci e delle valute che si tenevano a [Bruges] nel '300 e nel '400 presso il palazzo *Ter Buerse* (già taverna che radunava mercanti e specializzata nella loro consulenza[\[9\]] poi centro della piazza luogo degli scambi monetari e delle sedi "nazionali" dei mercanti stranieri), costruito dall'antica famiglia aristocratica *Van der Bourse*, che decorò (com'è ancora visibile) l'ingresso del palazzo con il proprio simbolo araldico: tre borse
[\[10\]] Dopo Bruges, le prime borse sorsero ad [Anversa] nel [1531] a [Lione] nel [1548] e a [Francoforte sul Meno] nel 1585
Il cammino delle borse fu quello di passare da una gestione privata ad una pubblica, fortemente regolamentata
Well my dear man story goes in ww2 American soldier in walonia (French Belgium) where offered fries and they thought they where in France
I mean the people
I think it is wrong to have a weapon factory that is in hands of the government that produces more weapons then the army need and sell it to Saudi Arabia and other violent people
Yeah I mean it’s actually a cool idea but in practice it doesn’t turn out good
But you can only know that cuz it happened
A Belgien just invented it
It's not his fault that people overuse it
I think we are still a lot better of then if he jad't invented it
But yeah the backlash isn't great
No problem thanks for liberating us
Haha yeah I formulated it weird I know
We have East and West Flanders, but that is a historical region, then also Vlaams-Brabant and Brabant Wallon which used to be part of Brabant (together with the now called province of Antwerp and Noord Brabant (NL))
The province of Antwerpen, Namur, Luxembourg and Liege are just named after their province's 'capital'.
Goodbye Limburg
Best part is that East Flanders isn't in the East of Flanders anymore
Didn't count that as a bland name
Somehow France has always been good at making people lose their own language and making them speak French
Its name comes from a city, the capital of the former Duchy: Limbourg
In the province of Liège nowadays though
I'm struggling with understanding what will actually change
People seem to just get worked up without much substance
Maybe it's just me not reading up on it, but then again it isn't terribly much reported in our newspapers
Young people complain about something they don't understand and make bad decisions
Nothing new under the sky(.)[
In all seriousness, I think it is great this got approved
The opposition has been wildly misplaced
A lot of concerns were raised, but in reality the biggest issues people had have been resolved
Where can we find a list of who voted what
I might doing something wrong, but on the Europarl website I can only see that a vote is schedule today, not the results
This is a directive
The EU has no say over this
It's entirely up to the member states to implement and enforce the laws
The EU will only sue member states which have done something illegal under the directive
Again, article 13/17 is not addressed to companies
It's addressed to member states
I don't think fully democratic countries exists
This is democracy these days:
Be a politician and look attractive to the people (and cooperation's) so they choose you
Get elected
Follow the parties interest
You can now help decide things for 4 years
This includes the decision of problems that where not present during the election
You have secured your pension so everyone can fuck off now
We are just an autocracy in disguise, they give us the feeling of choice and freedom but the truth is that we have no choice nor freedom
Most of those demonstrations came at least a year too late
There has been a lot of criticism about the directive way before the june 2018 vote
Most of that criticism came from academics, governments and even from the UN rapporteur
I know they didn't solve all the issues all the issues, but at least 80% of the issues that were brought up have been solved, and part of them were in the end rejected by parliament
For activists it's fair to bring in ideological issues with the directive, but they did that way too late
If you have issues with the directive, now it's the time to talk and/or discuss it with your national members of parliament BEFORE it's put into law
One of the things to gain with that is a strong voice on the table during stakeholder meetings
Another gain is can be a more flexible approach of exception to copyright protections
These tools are already provided in an earlier directive, but now will be the time that national laws will be re-evaluated
> Until Instagram blocks the upload of your photo of you and your spouse in front of the illuminated Eiffel Tower because apparently that needs to be licensed
Not for private citizens but the filter won't make a difference
If Instagram did that, they would have violated the law
Article 17(7) bans that
Companies only have to make a best effort to prevent the upload of specific works reported to them by the rightowners
That best effort is limited by the cost (Article 17(5)), as well as the fact that any such effort may not result in legitimate works being taken offline
Additionally, your Eiffel Tower example is a great way to illustrate what happens when no technology exists that could even begin to prevent re-uploads
If the owners of the Eiffel Tower go to Instagram, and ask it to prevent the upload of that work (being the Eiffel Tower), Instagram would simply cite recital 66 which says:
> _Different means to avoid the availability of unauthorised copyright-protected content could be appropriate and proportionate depending on the type of content, and, therefore, it cannot be excluded that in some cases availability of unauthorised content can only be avoided upon notification of rightholders
Or in other words, because it is impossible for software to distinguish photos of the Eiffel Tower reliably, it is completely acceptable they rely on the rigthholders reporting every individual photo separately
However, if you uploaded a full length Disney movie to YouTube, a platform would trivially be able to detect that, unless you specifically tampered with it, and be able to take it offline
This is so platforms are incentivised to do licensing agreements
Until now, YouTube could just profit off of that movie until the rightholder complained
They offered breadcrumbs to rightholders as "compensation". The rightholders were in no position to ask for a fair remuneration, because legally YouTube is allowed to profit off of pirated content - and the rightholders cannot simply walk away from the negotiations since they didn't upload their content in the first place
The mechanism ensures that YouTube also has an incentive to conduct licensing agreements, since now they will be required to make a transparent and best effort to prevent users from re-uploading the same content over and over again when it is taken offline
I used a Disney movie as an example here, but the impact is actually larger for smaller content creators who do not even receive breadcrumbs, and do not even get close to having the capacity to find all copies of their content
A regulation is an EU law
A directive is an EU legislative framework where member states are expected to implement a law that satisfies that directive
Every member state will make a different law, so /u/nanopulga suggests that websites will just ignore the laws
I know it's a bit extreme to suggest
But I think it would be possible to merge technology with politics
For example we could have a system that keeps some sort of trust tree and people assign trust to certain politicians
People can choice to revoke trust and give it to another politician or decide to step up and demand to be heard themselves
No need to plan elections, the political landscape can chance any time and politicians have no insurance they either do their job good or lose it
This is what I consider to be a democracy, the argument that the population can not micromanage an entire country might be true, but I think that if the population disagrees with a certain law we should be able to act immediately and not within the next election
Yes, because all these things do not matter if you aren't rich or have influence (those 2 usually go hand in hand)
- You can have freedom of speech, but what is the point of advertisers and big companies can decide to snuff out your platform if you cross their lines
- Freedom of press is a shitshow
A journalist is only as free as it's platform/medium allows it to be
Most mediums have a political agenda
If they speak on their own platform it will not reach a lot of people
- Freedom of assembly
Tell that to the yellow vest protesters in France
I'd rather call it Free to get beaten to shit by the police if your argument doesn't benefit the political agenda
- Right to private property
This is a right capitalism provides and doesn't really have much to do with democracy
- Right to due process
Also a shitshow
Yes you have to right to process but if you don't have monies good luck with that
Although it depends on what case thought
-  right to presumption of innocence
Again nothing to do with democracy, it's morals and how justice systems function
Also in most cases I you are guilty until proven otherwise
- Equality under the law
Sure, but it's those who practice the law that are doing it unequal
As long their are lobbyist and under table deals there will no be equality, its usually the party with the biggest pockets that wins
I've never seen pizza's served with additional sauces
Only thing you similar you get here is a little bag of hot chili oil if you get pizza at the kebab place
Dipping pizza in garlic sauce is defo a thing in belgium, I do it sometimes but it makes me feel extremely gross afterwards
Belgium:
Pros : small, nothing is really far
Every kind of food you'd want
Social security
Cons : politics is totally out of control, nothing is done anymore
Prices are increasing, life quality is slowly decreasing
Change is almost impossible
Salaries are not evolving (frozen for a long time) but cost of living are
There's a massive exode of graduated people that prefer getting a lower salary for a better quality of life somewhere else
>politics has been a shitshow since forever
I'm quite certain this is going on everywhere
> sad food culture
Welcome to visit us down here any time you like
> politics not as big of a mess as other countries
I wonder who you could refering to :)
Btw, I’m Belgian
But what would happen should the tax haven issue be handled
> in case of war we always get attacked first
I don't know
We had our fair share of unexpected visitations too ;)
Wow that's bleak
Politics is a problem, but I'm not experiencing the 'massive exodus' your experiencing
I believe we are actually better protected against rising prices than most countries, thanks to the index system that makes wages follow the cost of living, except for the occasional index jump
And I think quality of life is actually excellent over here
I'd say
Pros: great, varied food and beers
Multi-cultural
Well connected
Culturally vibrant for such a small country (festivals,...)
Cons: shitshow politics
Poor infrastructures (our highways make us the laughing stock of our neighbours)
Shit weather all year round
Small time mentality: very few ambitious projects attempted
Thanks for this :) didn't mentioned it because people often mention chocolate and waffles first :p if I go to another country, I'm almost always missing the Belgian beers if the country is not a beer country itself :)
The wages are actually not following the cost of living
Even though we can for sure not complain, because it's far better than a lot of other countries in the world
The quality of life is decreasing, with the raising of the retirement age, the pollution that's getting really a problem in cities, and the lack of general direction of the country
I'm really getting sick of this country
And a lot of people around me as well (not just 2 or 3, it's actually more 20 or 30)
We're just sick that the country does not care about it's people, and even less about the environment
Sick that the differences between the north and the south (not counting the German speaking people, but I don't forget them) cannot be resolved, due to stupid cliché... That are not entirely untrue
I lived in multiple other countries, like Spain and Czech Republic, and it was feeling a lot better
Agreed
You wrote it better than me
Thx
As retirement is still a long (and ever increasing )way off for me, that's not something that's really affecting my quality of life
And I think we're not exactly alone in the world with that issue, see for example the massive strikes in France
I think you might be a bit optimistic about other countries, they probably have their issues as well
(Spain and it's Catalans - I'm not sure that's doing better than Flanders and Walloons
The wages not rising as fast as the cost for living is pretty much anywhere though
yes, the traditional dutch kapsalon
Who could forget
Tbh you have to share those with us so you get only 50% credit
I'm not saying that everything is better somewhere else
Of course every country has its pros and cons
I just can't stand Belgium anymore
That started a few years ago, and it's been increasing ever since
I don't know anything about such word
However, since it seems there is a word for it in French and German, it's likely there used to be a word for this in Dutch as well
An old word, as we don't really have illegal abortions here anymore
I've heard the term Engeltjesmaker" maybe twice in my life before but other than that I agree
Not really a word for it in our modern vocabulary
For me that would be Die Wacht am Rhein and La Marseillaise
*Катюша* and *Священная война* by the Red Army Choir
Especially *Катюша*.
On a humoristic note: [Song of the Walloon Student]
The Soviet, Dutch (Wilhelmus) and French (La Marseillaise) Anthems, Bella Ciao and Scotland the Brave are all amazing songs imo
Whenever I hear the March of the Defenders of Moscow it makes me want to wear an ear flap hat, grab a Mosin-Nagant rifle, and run to give my life for the Motherland
Red Army Choir is amazing, too bad they pretty much died in that crash
I have that but with the song Jerusalem ("And did those feet in ancient time")
I'm neither English nor religious
Still I feel a weird patriotistic feeling when hearing and wanting to sing along to the song
They died in a helicopter crash a few years ago, if they are back it's just completely different people
I think it would be either Buizingen (two trains collided) or Ghislenghien (gas line explosion)
From those in reltively recent history was probably the [dioxin crisis] the [l'Innovation fire] and the [2003 heatwave]
From Italy, [Seveso] also comes to mind
Not big in casualties (fortunately), but definitely famous for its repercussions
"Thanks" to it, the EU adopted better safety regulations for the chemical industry:
> Industrial safety regulations were passed in the European Community in 1982 called the Seveso Directive,[15] which imposed much stronger industrial regulations
The Seveso Directive was updated in 1996, 2008 and 2012 and is currently referred to as the Seveso III Directive (or COMAH Regulations in the United Kingdom)
I'd say that the [MS Herald of Free Enterprise] can also count: a ferry that capsized right after leaving the port of Zeebrugge, killing 193
In addition to that, some other large disasters in Belgium were:
* The [**Marcinelle mining disaster**] in 1956, which killed 262 coal miners, and was the worst mining disaster in Belgian history
* The capsizing of the [**MS Herald of Free Enterprise**] in 1987, which killed 193 of the crew and passengers, as u/lunaclio already mentioned
* The [**explosion of a chemical plant in Tessenderlo**] in 1942, which killed 189 and injured more than 900
Like the explosion in Beirut, this explosion was also caused by improperly handled ammonium nitrate
Well, that, and y'know, the two World Wars can probably also be classified as disasters that killed a lot of people
More than any of the civilian disasters in Belgian history
Though some of the worst incidents during the Wars in terms of civilian casualties were:
* The [**explosion of a German ammunition train in Hamont**] in 1918, which killed an unclear number of civilians, which was later estimated to be about 1,000
* The [**bombing of Mortsel**] in 1943 by the allied forces, which killed 936 civilians
Mussels & fries
1 or 2 per year, no more
Probably a little more in Flanders located closer to the sea
Also waffles
Unless it comes from a craft stand located in the city center or the supermarket bought for children, nobody eats it often
When going to Brussels or Liège, you'll see a lot of shops selling waffles
I literally can't tell you the last time I ate a waffle
I think as Belgians we often forget the importance of waffles in our lives because we often reduce 'waffle' to the Brussels waffles you eat in tea rooms or the Liège waffle you eat in shoppingstreets in city centers
But we often don't think of all the other types of waffles that we've eaten way more often in our lives:
Suzy waffle / sugar waffle (when it's not from Lotus)] Basically the Liège waffle you can buy in the supermarket
I have eating this one hundreds of times in my life
[Eggwaffles] also the kind you buy in the supermarket
Really, really soft and they melt in your mouth
I'm not sure if this is just me, but I always seen this as a waffle for small children (wouldn't stop me as an adult to eat it though)
[(West-Flemish) Lukken] [butter crisps (Jules Destrooper version)]  a.k.a. New year's cookies: A very classy and classic cookie for when someone comes around for coffee, definitely around New Years
[Soft homemade fruit waffles] (often with tiny bits of apple, though the pieces weren't always obvious when eating the waffles): I made these myself as a kid (when I was old enough to already use the waffle iron obviously)
In my primary school it was also quite a popular thing to bring to school to eat during the break or to give to your class mates on your birthday (generally made by the moms ofcourse)
They're so deliciously soft
I don't have time left to continue now
If I think of something else I'll add it later on
Anyone else who wants to, feel free join in with the waffle love and waffle nostalgia :-)
I really love bigos with a good kielbasa which I clearly prefer to German or Alsatian sauerkraut
I know the recipe from my grandparents originated from Poland :), it seems there are a lot of different ones
I never thought of that as a purely Italian thing
I always assumed it was an (Italian inspired) American thing
But maybe Americans think it's Italian
Not sure
I'm pretty sure I've only heard of this concept through American sources
&#x200B;
I have spent some time around Italians when studying abroad (not in Italy)
And oh boy, you're barely kidding when saying that destroying Italian cuisine is a capital sin for you guys, you take the authenticity of Italian food very seriously
:-)
Also look at the restaurants who serve mussels in that period, it's a very common dish
I think it's rather a special case because if mussels are always associated with fries, I doubt that we eat on average fries more than 2-3x per month and often with burgers, carbonades, plain American, steak, "roulade" endives,etc
We have the same
And you have to take a sip before putting your drink back on the table
I chose to do it like this last year:
Latin: Blue
Math: Blue
Nature sciences: Green
Geography: Yellow
Dutch: Orange
French: Green
History: Yellow
Religion: Yellow
Technology: Red
Music: Black
The traffic is really, really bad
Anywhere on the highways near Antwerp or Brussels during rush hour and often outside of rush hour you will find yourself in traffic
Belgium is a transit country so we have a lot of trucks passing through, as well as a dated mentality in the populace about cars
(Meaning everyone will have one/two even if they dont even need it, because its still seen as somewhat of a status symbol) Our system of salary cars doesnt help the problem either
Sadly traffic is a complicated problem to solve and there seems to be no solution in sight anytime soon
Highest taxes in the world
The Flemish private medias are hold by groups/companies that were created by nazi collaborators, hence why the far-right ideas are so widespread and accepted as normal there
Flanders is probably the part of Western Europe that did the least to punish the fascists, who could continue their life like nothing happened
Haha, whenever I drive in the Netherlands, I honest to god say to my self "wow we really should visit more often, the have so much more green compared to Belgium"
And no government tot spend them
Werent there a lot of instances of suspected collaborators being killed after/near the end of ww2
At least thats what happened in my area
Some innocent people were killed because other folk thought they had been working for the nazis
I know about the media groups being owned by just a few people, but i didnt know we had been so kind to fascists
I know some politicians have ties (via their grandparents) to the nazi regime but never looked much into it, if the same is true for the press, thats more interesting to me
I think that's more about the swiss being much better off than the rest of european countries
Ever looked up net wages in belgium
No, it’s Belgium sadly enough
While I don't let it bother me both my dad and sister became a heck of a lot more racist after teaching/going to school in places like Ghent
Getting attacked as a teacher or my sister having to wait some days until I get done with school so we can drive home and constantly have Turks/Moroccans yelling at her(she's a blonde) to the point she doesn't feel safe waiting on the sidewalk doesn't exactly help
Ow, and the bunch of foreign kids who basically knocked out teeth with pool cues because you looked at them funny
On multiple occasions
Basically if they arrived at an establishment I left, cops  would be there soon anyway
[A video explains it] the title is a bit clickbait/provocative, but there are more nuances in the video
They have to split the 2018 budget in Parts of twelve and that Will be the working budget for 2019
Yeah no, this is yet another instance where wikipedia isn't well updated or w/e the issue is
Belgium is frequently ranked #1 and sometimes gets dropped to second place but only to quickly regain the first place ;)
Great explanation, even though I didnt always agree with the presenter
Also good to use my French again haha
On top of that we have a lot of "hidden taxes" like social contributions
I would say Gent
Whenever I hear tourists talk about Belgium, they often find Brussels boring, either find Bruges artificial or wonderful but everyone seems to love Gent
I have to agree, Gent has a great historical center, a vibrant student life, a practical public transport system and it's easy to bike there
Gent is for the younger people, Bruges for the elderly
Take the tourist out of Bruges and the city is dead, in Gent life begins when the tourists are gone
But that's not great per se
After living in Gent for 5 years I'm heading back to Bruges
The public transport isn't that great and cycling in Gent can be really dangerous (especially with the tram)
I agree that this is probably the best answer, but a lot of Belgians (unfairly, imo) hate Ghent for being a socialist bastion coming up with crazy socialist ideas like banning all car traffic from the city centre
Same with Leuven btw
I also came here to say Gent
Mechelen maybe
Foreigners may not know it, but I don't think I've ever heard a Belgian say something bad about Mechelen
The Welsh are lush
Bavaria seems to be pretty liked and it's a region nice to visit
Leuven is beautiful but mainly a student city, Antwerp is seen as your ordinary port city
Yet I think Antwerp is better than Gent
I think I've heard absolutely no-one hate on Gent because they're a socialist city
And I'm from rural West Flanders, no bigger hate for Gent than from rural West Flanders
Heck to this day my father won't visit Gent because he absolutely hates the city
I have never heard that Gent was a socialist city
I mean Gent tends to vote more to the left than Antwerp for example but that's it
Architecture or technology
Antwerp has I think more lovers but Gent will have less haters
Maybe I've spent too much time reading the comments on the Facebook pages of Belgian newspapers then, my apologies
I guess I based my experience on the backlash from the traffic circulation plan, but it's entirely possible I'm wrong, so my apologies
Yet Vienna is rated the best city to live in
Nothing like the good old comic murals in Antwerp
Gent is even better imo
The day you start taking HLN comments for truth is the day your life ends
Nice
I'm in my second year now
Lots and lots of work but you can bet that both your creative and theoratical skills will take enormous leaps in no time
Definitely
To be fair, I only read them to understand what people with a completely different mindset than my own think about the news (okay, yes, also to laugh at dumb people sometimes)
Also, it's not just HLN, it's De Standaard, De Morgen and VRT NWS too
Try reading the comments on more scientific things
I'm not overly educated in science(business guy) but the stupidity on display in many cases is almost impressive
Well you have to diversify your stupidity you know
I just think it's easier to have it all in one language
I know my dad (who's also a programmer) likes to name variables in Dutch
I cant stand it, tho
It's just too messy
English, but the problem is that sometimes we don't realize always that we're using false friends
My Mum has always shopped at Lidl, back in Germany my parents were on a tight budget, and now we go there because they have good products
People at my dorm make fun of it, and some say they don't trust the food, but they're all from well off parents so
Yeah
I go there because they also have German products
And bc my Mum eventually worked for a company that worked with Lidl on frozen meals for a few years
She said they demanded very high quality for low prices
It is seen as selling cheap/low quality products, although it has improved over the years
> Here in Czechia it’s one of the better one, while when I was in England everybody made jokes about how bad it is
Why is that
Maybe because products in Slavic Europe are even of lower standards/worse quality than the ones in Western Europe
Since Lidl is from Germany, a western country, what is low standards in the west might still be seen as better standards in ex-sovietic countries
I don't mean to offend of course, but the meats and products we find in Polish or Russian stores here are quite low quality, and each time there is a food scandal, it's very often with products from an ex eastern-block country
It’s bad, we also joke about it
>Colruyt
>pleasant experience
Colruyt literally has the aesthetic of a warehouse
Kind of the same story here in Belgium actually
Yeah
But everything is placed logical and the store is in general pretty clean
And don't forget that they sometimes bake little sausages or other stuff for customers to taste
Because it is known that you have lower quality standards, less controls over quality
We have plenty Polish immigrants in Belgium, and thus, you can find Polish stores with products imported from Poland, and the quality is definitely lower
The fact Polish people here comment that Lidl is seen as high quality quite proves the point as well
Eh I grew up on Lidl and Aldi stuff bc my Mum always likes to save money (and their produce is often better and cheaper than for example Colruyt)
If the budget is tight, you have no choice
Plus it's a piece of home in Belgium
The problem I have with this idea of being jealous when your so is meeting with another person of the opposite gender is what if your so was bisexual
She's no longer allowed to go out with friends at all
How does that work
Here's a fucking idea, don't be with somebody you don't trust
My sister always hung out with guys in high school(way less drama according to her)
If her boyfriend had issues with her 2 best male friends she has known for 10+ years they can sod off
In my 1st and 2nd year of high school, I was in a class with 18 boys and 3 girls (in the 2nd year 4) We were all really good friends and even though my friend from another class joked about me being in love with a good male friend from my class, everyone knew nobody in our class/in other classes was in a relationship
(And your sister is right, waaayyy less drama with boys XD)
Sometimes it's different though
My best male friend is going to another school (i know him from when i started school, so like 12 years) and I said to some friends that i dreamed that he was back and i was happy, because I am really going to miss him
They started singing that im in love with him, wich is not true
Conclusion: it's not really weird in Belgium, it just depends on the people that see it
In Flanders:
1) A close friend/family calls: "Yo" (really informal greeting), "Ja" (yes)
2) Known contact, but not really close: "Hallo, [name]" (Hello)
3) Unknown number: Met [full name] (with - as in talking with
4) Calling to a company, like your internet provider, this is what my mom often does: "Een goedemiddag, u spreekt met [last name] from [city]
" (Good afternoon, you're talking to ...)
Most of the time I say: "Allo me \[name\]" which is the dialect pronunciation of "Hallo, met \[name\]" (Hello, with \[name\])
1830, during the Belgian revolution
The first mention of Belgium is in Caesar's De Bello Gallico, where he describes the tribe of the Belgae as the bravest of all Gauls
It should be noted that Caesar's reasoning that we were the bravest is based on the fact that we were the furthest from Roman civilization and merchants only seldom visited, preventing things that would make a man "soft" from entering into our society, not actual battle prowess
Then for literally thousands of years, we're conquered by this or that kingdom (some argue that this is the reason why Belgians are pretty good at learning new languages), until we launch a revolution against William I of the Netherlands in 1830
Our national holiday, which for many countries marks the date that something significant happened for the foundation of their country, is 21st of July
It commemorates the day in 1831 that our first king, Leopold I (not to be confused with his son, Leopold II, who wrecked Congo),  acceded to the throne
Well we became independent from the Netherlands in 1830 and got our first king on 21st july 1831 (our national holiday)
But we were already independent as the United Belgian States from January 1790 untill December 1790
Julius Caesar is technically the first person that meantioned our country
Belgica was a province of the Roman Empire and the Belgae lived there (they were a mix between Gauls and Germanic peoples, just like Belgium now)
111 years old
lol that’s cool
Didn't France become a monarchy again after Napoleon for a couple decades
Maybe try [this] if you're interested
Do you know that a truck/lorry is [that] What kind of family has that to begin with even in the US
Otherwise, yeah, no need for a lorry, you can rent, have delivery, or borrow the van of an acquaintance, or borrow or rent a trailer to attach to your car
Most people know someone that has a car with tow hook & trailer or a van or can use one from work
Otherwise you can rent a van from the home improvement store, furniture store, rental place (you can rent anything here: vans, trailers, diggers, scissor lifts, etc
), etc
or have their stuff delivered for an extra fee
Delivery of large items is even free at a lot of stores
Say I live in an apartment on the third floor and I need a new fridge
If I have the new fridge delivered, the delivery guys will bring it to the third floor and take my old busted fridge of my hands for recycling (we pay recupel tax for this)
If I were to pick up my new fridge at the store I would have to lug it to the third floor myself and get my old fridge down to the ground floor as well
Sometimes we just make multiple trips
Say I need 500kg of gravel (20 bags of 25kg)
I'll just make 2 trips to the home improvement store's drive through and get 10 bags each trip in my regular car
Everything is close by, so an extra 20 minute trip is just less hassle
I think you got yourself confused
People in the US refer to semi-truck as "semi" and pick-up truck as "truck".
Pick-ups aren't trucks, they are big cars/SUVs
Truck/lorry is [that] That's the only thing that can be called a truck
We do that here too in Belgium
Belgians love home improvement
If you need a lot of drywall you just have it delivered
If you only need a small amount you can rent a van at the home improvement store (sometimes even free for a certain amount of time/distance)
Otherwise you borrow a van or trailer from someone (dad, uncle, friend, work, etc
You could also rent one from a car rental place, but that's usually more expensive than using the store's van
My parents drive a small Mazda2, but my dad has a small trailer he bought second hand for €250 that can hook up to it when he needs to haul larger items
He's hauled bricks, new doors, a washing machine, a refrigerator, a large dinner table, a 65" TV and much more in that thing
This way they can drive a small car that easily fits everywhere while still being able to transport larger items when the need arises
> You do realise that truck simply means a vehicle designed to transport cargo, right
It must be designed to transport cargo, and weight more than 3 500 Kgs
What you have shown is a truck, because it is clearly heavy, and is utilitarian before anything
Pickups aren't trucks because : they weight less than 3,5 tons, and their utilitarian side is secondary, most people use them as SUVs/big fancy cars
Having a small open trunk isn't enough to be called a "truck".
To drive a truck, you need a special driving license that allows you to drive vehicules above 3500 kgs, called C license
You can drive a pickup with a normal B license, hence why it isn't a truck
Trucks are vehicules that require a C driving license in Europe
Makes sense
If they don't give delivery for free when you buy a lot they wouldn't be selling over here
I think there is in general a bit less DIY
My father was big into that but I'm more a guy that goes "each has their job".
If I need something I hire somebody that does it for a living
To be fair, money isn't really a concern for me
Might bother more if it was
Same type of behaviour if a Belgian goes to Corsica : if they think you are from France, they are unpleasant with you, they become much nicer when they know you are not French
The German Walloon are quite nice
Little sidenote for the non-Dutch speakers who are reading this
The verb 'oppassen' can mean 'watch out', it can be used it 'dangerous' situations: someone crossing a street or someone dropping a glass on someone's foot
But it can also mean 'keep an eye on': for example keeping an eye on someone's kid, or keeping an eye on someone's backpack when they go to the restroom etc
Very similar meanings but slightly different connotations
The noun 'oppas' as 'babysit' has more the connotation of 'keeping an eye on'.
Yeah, this is probably the best I can think of
I don't think it's used a lot in Flanders (more a word from the Netherlands I think) , but I live close to the Belgian - Dutch border, so we got some overlap and it's used here too
From West-Flanders, close to the French border (so, far away from the Netherlands)
I've definitely heard the word 'oppas' being used around here too
I think this depends regionally, I never used it and the people around me don't either, my mom mentioned it's more of a thing from the Netherlands
I live in southern province Antwerp close to Vlaams Brabant
So I suppose it really is a regional thing
Oh really
I always thought of it as more of a Dutch word than also being used in Flanders a lot
Wow, learn something new every day
Wow ok, thank you
Zijde zeker dadde noar 't west vloanderen woart gegoan
No such thing in Belgian schools
Definitely not a general thing
Belgian schools have a few distinctions: in academic secundary education (ASO), there's no cooking in any school I have experience with
They are more focused on sciences and laguage
Skilled profession secundary (BSO) has it, but I'm pretty sure it depends on your curriculum
I'm not sure about art school (KSO), but then again, nobody who's not in arts school has a clue what they do over there
Really
In French-speaking Belgium, there is no such thing, at least not if you are in general (so, the options aimed at academic studies after secondary school)
I’m against it
Pretty easy to tell you how I feel about it
It happens all the time
Imagine that someone would actually have to know Dutch to live here
Unimaginable
Well for resident status I wouldn't impose any language requirements, people should still be able to learn the language and customs once here
But for citizenship I think it isn't too far-fetched to have as a requirement that you should show some measure of integration, or at least the means of engaging in society
And for that language is essential
I'm not saying that they should have perfect Mastery of that language, but at least be able to work efficiently
What if they learned a Sami language
Seems to be the consensus somewhat
Should technically be possible, but not exactly the smartest move for the immigrant
There is a university my friend goes to and it says that any scientific or otherwise discoveries made by students who go to the university belong to the university, their reasoning was that they used university property so that apparently makes it fair to take the discovery from the student
He decided to do his research at home, or keep it a secret untill the university no longer has claim to any discoveries he may make, doubt he's gonna make any though, he studies pharmacy things so it's gonna be hard to make discoveries I think
who likes winter
it's cold and there is less stuff to do outside
You ignore them
Live here for 8 years, couldn't give you a name of who lives within 5 houses of me in any direction
My parents are best friends with everyone on their street, they go running together, celebrate birthdays together and they play darts, cards, chess, etc
together
But they also live in the countryside
I recently moved from Belgium to a city in Germany and I don't really know what my neighbors look like
We try to avoid eachother in general, but if you ask something of someone, doesn't even matter if he/she isn't your neighbour, they will do they're best to help you
I know everybody in a 3 mile radius around my house by face and when we cross eachother we smile or nod
But you don't really see people break the silence to often
And when the do, most of the time they're from the Netherlands
I only talk to the ones next to me or across the street of me, all the rest gets a good day to you
Personally i don't want to get too close with them as then they start conversations over the garden fence when i'm in the garden chilling
i don't have the need for that, a quick chat at the door while coming home/leaving no problemo
It's your own choice
People won't be mad if you don't look for contact
But if you just moved it's much appreciated that you at least introduce yourself
I know most of the people living in my street, or at least I know in what house they live
My neighbour-neighbours we know very well, we accept each other's mail, have a drink
I know I would do the same
30-45 minute bus ride or 30 minutes by car
Shop connected to my house
I've had cases where I woke up at 9
55 and open shop at 10
30 Seconds right across the street
And a folding bicycle
I love the slavic name ‘Polina’
To be fair, Polish can make anything sound badass
"financially independent" move-out between 22 and 32 mostly
In Belgium people just leave when they feel ready i still live with my parents at age 24 my dad did not move out until he was 27 less than a year before i was born i'm planning to move out later this year or next year some of my friends already moved out at age 21
According to some people on the internet my country is not a country
We technically deposed our monarch and stripped him of his powers to pass a law to make abortion legal then reinstated him after we passed the law and he couldn't block it anymore
This was 1990 so not all that long ago
Out royal family doesn't even have a royal crown (I think)
In the Elder Scrolls games (and extended universe) there is an elfish race named Bosmer, or Wood Elf
'Bos' is the Dutch word for 'forrest'.
In Flanders some people use ''ezel'' as an insult, but it's not really common
Like: "Eej stoemen ezel". But again, not common
Probably only heard it a couple times in my life
Haha I remember that, it was really weird the first time I read it
It probably sounds a bit more exotic to English speakers than just the word 'leech'.

Apparently people think we eat fries almost daily
We don’t, actually, I think most people eat it once a week, twice max
Digital tv device to pause a TV program
Edit: misunderstood the question
I haven't see such device abroad
Answer to your question : euh, waffles aren't eaten that much as thought abroad
How flat are your flat lands
That really depends on the circles you're in
I don't know many people that don't smoke weed for example
Not just the younger people, also my Dutch dad and most of his friends smoke weed and have plants themselves
you’re not Belgian sooo
Not that I know
>some maybe around 800m.
That higher than everything in Belgium, you definitely all live in mountains
I've seen it quite a bit, but always in the context of porn
Our first king, Leopold I, married princess Charlotte of Wales, who was second in line to the throne
If she hadn’t died after only one year of marriage, our future king would one day have been the husband of the queen of England
He was then offered the crown of Greece, but declined because he thought the country to be too unstable
That’s how he ended up becoming king of our newly founded country, Belgium
Imagine declining a crown to an unstable country and then founding *Belgium*
In the last week alone I've seen this myth that Fritz was the one who did that being spread 3 times already
There have been defenestrations in Leuven a very long time ago
Then again Leuven only has about 100
000 inhabitants (the actual number is higher because there's about half as many students but since they go home in the weekend they're not official inhabitants)
A frituur, you could compare it with a McDonalds but all frituren are privately owned (so frituur is not a chain or brand or anything) and they are cheaper and way better than McDonalds
Edit: also way smaller than a McDonalds, most have like 3 tables max or so
The big flemish parties voted against it like the dumbasses they are
I like Pfand it'll solve a lot of littering problems Belgium has
One of the best things about living in Belgium, I'm always disappointed by the dominating presence of bad fast food chains in most other countries
They are everywhere here and I love it
Netherlands and Belgium love to prepare all kinds of things in croquette style too
Kroketten
We have them w cheese, with garnalen
Witfloof
It's a loan word from your bullar
Appletizer is too sweet :/
It can basically be compared as a name with "pub" or "cafe".
We have them all over the place here in Belgium and the good ones make a lot of money
It’s an actual thing, indeed
Belgium has loads of them
My town has only 8000 people and we have like 5 of them
Yeah, very comparable to a chippy
I have no idea what that is, but they seem like a brand and don’t really look like a frituur
But it’s not, actually
Well, everybody knows civilization ends at the frontier of the [western roman empire]
Here in Belgium it seems that some people do a cold breakfast and lunch and a hot dinner or they have a cold breakfast and dinner but a hot lunch
Personally I eat my hot meal at dinner
Lunch is bread or sandwiches
NVA claims that the prices of the goods will go up and they say it's not as effective as recycling, which is bs
They promised to have a discussion and evaluation, but then we had to go vote so
A lot of people suspect lobbying
I recentst read an article that, on good days, they make €3
200
Maybe I should just quit my studies and start a frituur
VB and Open Vld are also against
Together with N-VA they have a blocking majority in parliament
No, that would be the friteuse
A friend of my father owned one for 20 years
He retired when he hit 40
I mean
yes, being successfully self employed will earn you more money
Know of course 50% go bankrupt within 3 years or something
Not entirely
Those look more like restaurants, most frituren have like 3 tables max
Thanks
Wow, ugh
Get some sense in them
[Brussels waffles with "warme krieken"]
(The first and second picture, not of great quality, but at least it looks real and it shows you how it is served)
Edit: For those who are not familiar with 'krieken'. In Flanders and Southern Netherlands we call a sour cherry (prunus cerasus) 'een kriek'. "Warme krieken" is a kind of sweet sauce made out of [prepares sour cherries] You use the sap that is in the jar to make the sauce, then add the cherries back into the sauce
We eat it with Brussels waffles and ice cream as dessert, but can also with meatballs and a slice of bread as a proper meal
The belgian cake called [Brésilienne] (literally called ("Brazilian")
Die krieken maken het wel af
My absolute favourite sweet dish coming from our country
It only rather recently occured to me that they are 100% a Belgian thing, and not imported from France or Austria or whatever
I don't think I've ever seen them offered abroad anyway, while over here they are offered almost everywhere
From the smallest bakery to the biggest supermarket
Brésilienne, the crème-glace or the gateau, with extra notjes
Inderdaad
Voor mij moet het ook echt gewoon met warme krieken zijn en niets anders
They are two totally different things
The Brussels waffle is used like crépes, you need to put things on top of it, like powdered, sugar, fruit, ice cream, chocolate etc
The Liége waffles is a snack made out of a dense dough with small bits of sugar crystals in them
It is usually eaten without any toppings
It's pointless to compare the two
I honestly don't know and did't find any info on internet, sorry
Hell no ! It's custard, sweet whipped cream and nuts ! That's delightful
Ik wou appelflappen zeggen maar heb het opgezocht en het komt uit holland, raar dat zo iets lekker van daar komt
My thoughts exactly
Lakmans are waffles too, no point in comparing them to Brussels waffles
The same goes for Kempense galetten
Je verstaat toch wat krieken zijn, ik zie het probleem niet
Een kriek is niet hetzelfde als een kers
Leer eerst wat het verschil eenis tussen kersen en krieken, en dan mag jij meepraten over eten
Even genoeg gelachen, maar een kriek is dus niet zomaar een kers
Wat wij in Vlaanderen en Zuid-Nederland 'Krieken' noemen, heet in de rest van Nederland een 'Morel', een zure kers (*prunus cerasus*) als het ware
Een kriek is dus een kers maar niet elke kers is een kriek
Het bier type 'Kriek' is ook vernoemd naar dit type kers
Als we in België over kersen spreken, bedoelen we vrijwel altijd de zoete kers (*prunus avium*)
You did attacked a neutral country (Belgium) without any valid reason, you launched the offensive on civilised nations, so, yeah, you started it
Yes, many breweries have their version of Christmas beer, usually darker, sweeter and stronger in alcohol
Nearly every brewery in Belgium have a specific "winter/Christmas special beer". There are dozens of those
Not beer but 'jenever' and glühwine are popular during Christmas time
Depends on the beer
Leffe Christmas beer is an abomination that we should've never released to the world
Or Leffe in general
I'm still surprised how popular it is outside of Belgium
AB Inbev pushing lesser beers abroad because they don't sell here anymore
Depends on the area
In cities, not anymore
As far as you can go "rural" in Belgium, it tends to be more common
My parents for example have a woodstove
Me in Antwerp on the other hand, wouldn't make any friends with it
It wasn't exactly an empire, but Leopold II had Congo as a private property
In school, we learned that he used the profit he made there to enrich Belgium and especially build large buildings, we learned that Congolese people were brought to Belgium and displayed as animals in a zoo, we learned about the massacre and attrocities he ordered in Congo, etc
In the end Congo became Belgian property and later, they gained their freedom again
However, we learned that the Belgian government should have handled their independence differently (should have helped them more with the transition) as not shortly after, there was a crisis in Congo
It's definitely not a part of history we are proud of, but I am glad we learned about it in school
Because I feel like more often than not, the dark parts of your own country's history are quickly glazed over
Well, it probably would have been better if you stayed a republic
Maybe more likely, if said republic hadn't treated South Netherland/Belgium as badly and persecutively as Willem I did
Vic de Wachter in Flanders
I like his voice more than David Attenborough, honestly
Attenborough also speaks very unclearly in my opinion
I feel like Jacques Cousteau would be more iconic no
Or maybe that's just on an international level I don't know
Anyway, next to David Attenborough, he was the first to spring into my mind when thinking of iconic European documentary presenters
I was thinking about Rudi Vranckx
Surely it's Peter Cremers
Oh yes, of course
I was thinking of nature documentaries
Both voices are well known, but Vic De Wachter's name is more known, I think
He did many BBC documentaries such as Planet Earth and Planet Earth II
Sometimes people confuse the two voices
Right now, our 9 (?!) health ministers, I guess
With the literally biggest one Maggie De Block
Orders masks from a scam in Turkey, then orders masks not at a good standard for fighting against the covid
Then orders masks without the stripes to attach them to the ears
Oh, and helped cut the hospitals budget by 900 M€ a few years back with the now prime minister
That's a croque madame
They're known as "croque monsieur" amongst Dutch speaking people in Belgium
If you asked me for a tosti, I wouldn't even know what you were talking about
I thought he was specifying it wasn't croque monsieus for some reason
But yea, love them
I often take it if I need a quick snack somewhere
A croque madame has a fried egg on top though
You mean the croque monsieur machien
Surely a croque madame is more common
Croque monsieur with a friend egg over it
You have bacon in your croque
Mines always with ham
We have them also with bolonaise sauce in it
't Krokmasjien
I don't think there is a strict rule saying you can't put anything on top though
Still sounds better with bacon
It's the same in all of Belgium and France to my experience
No sauce
I think that the real contribution of Belgium goes further than simply hosting the institutions (all other member States would gladly take them) or being a founding member (there's nothing exceptional about that)
The main contribution, in my opinion, is in the art of compromising
We are experts in squabbling, negotiating, tearing ourselves apart, but in the end reaching a compromise nonetheless, and we are recognized as such in European political circles
This is why two of the three Presidents of the EU council have been Belgians
Our expertise, built for decades internally in community conflicts between flemings and walloons, is helpful at the EU level too
Furthermore, with one half of the country looking north and the other looking south, we are well placed to bridge this gap also found in European politics
•Founding member of pretty much every big European project (ESA, CERN) and the EU,
•Brussels
•Politicians, mainly ex-prime ministers who become president of the councel of Europe
(Van Rompuy and Charles Michel)
Brussels is home to the EU's most important institutions:
* Main seat of the European Parliament (the only reason Strasbourg is still around is because it's still officially in the treaties and the French refuse to give it up)
* European Commission
* European Council (which is not the same as the Council of Europe)
Besides being the de facto capital of the European Union, it also houses NATO's headquarters, the most important military alliance in Europe
Not just the presidencies, but Belgians are disproportionally represented in high level EU jobs
Beautiful text but full of crap
I can say that, source : am Belgian, knows our history
We've also dumped Tindemans, Martens, Dehaene and Verhofstadt there
The EFTA wasn't the precursor but the competing agreement
>Germany is one of the nations that forms the bedrock of the EU along with France, Italy and (formerly) Britain
By including Italy I assume you mean founding members
If so, it's quite shameful to exclude the BeNeLux from it
That being said, most of the other things I can agree on
I certainly don't. Last time I drank Guinness I drank a Belgian beer before it
The Guiness tasted as bland as it could get
Edit: but then again, the Belgian beer was "Oude Geuze Boon".
Glad that we contribute in more than one way
Our country was literally founded by compromise
While it's a funny meme
It doesn't matter much if the federal government takes too long to form if you have 5 other governments that make everything run more or less smoothly for the average joe
Might aswell add beer and waffles then ;)
How is hosting the
•European council,
•European parliament,
•European commission,
•NATO,
•EESC,
•EDA,
•IEEA,
•EUROCONTROL,
•and many more,
not a major contribution to Europe
You do know that this makes us a target for anyone against the EU or Europe in general or even NATO, right
What do you mean
•Is there sugar in Belgian beers
To answer that question you need to specify the beertype
Are there mainstream beers with sugar
Yes, most mainstream "kriek" (cherry) beer (or fruitbeer in general) has added sugar
But that leaves the vast majority of beers that don't have sugar added to them, even the original "kriek" beers don't have that
•Do we put sugar in our beer like people do with tea or coffee
No, never
Why is Italy making these demands
Well, Kriek is widespread ofcourse, as you can buy it everywhere, but so are all other kinds of unsweetened beer and those far outnumber Kriek
A cold kriek like Lindemans on a warm summer day, is good yes
But I wouldn't compare it to a beer like a Trappist or a Geuze ofcourse
(Edit: also note that most good version of this beer aren't as sweet as you might think)
But a proper unsweetened Kriek (without added sugar) like [Oude Kriek Boon] is heavenly though
[Léon Degrelles] and the [Rexist party] for the French-speaking side, [Staf Declercq] [Hendrik Elias] and the [Vlaams Nationaal Verbond] for the Dutch-speaking side
Verhofstadt
Don't forget [Cyriel Verschaeve] the crazy thing is there are still a few streets named after this traitor
A few weeks ago one of these cities (Kortrijk) decided to rename the street to a resistance fighter from WW I.
Id even dare to add Leopold III
Would you consider Gorbatjov a traitor
promised center-right politics based on entrepreneurship, then made a huge U-turn to globalism and radical leftist politics
Yeltsin was the one during the 90's right
Indeed socialist, i am somebody who calls such a disgusting u-turn guy a traitor
Child molestation in the Catholic Church sure is a big scandal
Someone set fire to a building designated as a future assylum centre for refugees
The major concern is the rising extremism on the right wing
Some are questioning the discours that was used by the right wing parties against the installation of this particular centre and if it may have instigated the arson
Not to mention that this party was and sometimes still is referred to as a facist party
Who is Epstein
The only Epstein I have ever heard about is the creator of the Epstein Drive in The Expanse books and TV show
Wallonia basically feels like a different country, that’s quite weird
How rude people in big cities are
I’m from Flanders and am amazed by how much nature and little houses Wallonia has in comparison
I don’t know if I could call it a culture shock though, but I live close to the language border and there is an immediate difference when crossing it
Very true
As soon as I go to Flanders I notice the differences
Different houses, different infrastructure, different people
Also, so many bikes
Well, we already had a couple of wars before
Seriously, nothing wrong with German or Austrian beer, we just have a bit more distinctive styles
I'm envious of all the bike paths
Here, we only have one bike path along the Meuse
(it's an awesome bike path tho)
Wait wait, there are no bike paths in Wallonia
Basically, if there's no alternative, yup
We sometimes have to
I'm actually pretty lucky because most of the way from my village to the nearest city has a bike path next to a river, completely separated from the road, but in the city, I basically just have to deal with cars and share the road with them
Including the old assholes in Mercs who think endangering my life, theirs, and other people's is worth not losing fifteen seconds
Oh, so very few
They exist, but [they're not nearly as common in Wallonia as in Flanders]
You're a poet
And so overly British
Love it
They’re turning an electric train (well metro) into a diesel train
Y'all are lucky
What's weird here is that you can see the border between Wallonia and Flanders if you look at a [map of bike paths]
But I am one of said Frenchies
:'(
(also, Belgian separatism isn't viable, but that's a whole 'nother topic)
But that sub is full of Dutch people and y'all have weird accents
BELGICA STRONK
Not that I know of
We're a peaceful bunch
And in fact, I really do like my Flemish countrymen
French and Dutch people are just neighbourinos with silly accents, but overall nice
At least in my opinion
I mean they make good wine, but apart from that, they're just weird
They can't even say 70 properly
(also, they vote for far-right and that ain't cool)
I have, on occasion, been known to drink beer out of a glass that was not specifically designed for that beer
In my defence, sometimes you have too much beer and not enough glasses, and I do try to stick to the shapes as much as possible
I'm not too fond of kids
I like dutch people and their accent (please don't kill me guys, I know it's wrong)
I'm not really into chocolate
I say "pain au chocolat".
I hate beer
And I don't give a fuck about football
Out
Heresy
I'm ok with pilsners but I hate Trappists or any stronger beer really
*takes note*
At least you like beer
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
Ping pong no 1581 for you
>"That sounds Spanish to me"
We have ''That sounds Chinese to me'' (in Dutch)
That just must've been Dutch people then idk, we very much refer to ourselves as Belgians
That or Flemish/Walloon
That is really interesting though
I mean Belgians are generally pretty calm people, but that a country on the other side of Europe would have a saying referring to us is very interesting
I wonder how that came to be
Blackface
In my school we have a rule that you can't wear too 'extreme' clothes to school, but nobody really cares as long as you don't come to school naked
Does anyone actually uses these, only the weird kids with overprotective parents use it
When I was young I used to love horse meat, I ate it everyday
Yes, the story says that they’re actually white, but they bring the presents through the chimneys so their face gets dirty from all the ashes in the chimney
While I also doubt that's true I fall asleep nice and warm in the Alps in my T-shirt
You snowboard, drink some hot chocolate and sit in the sun nice and hot
You watch the temprature and of course it's still freezing
Ice cold if it's that temperature back in Belgium though
No clue why
Would be my guess
Permanently cold air far away from the coast and high up -> dry air -> less loss of heat
Same reason that 20 degree water is cold, 20 degree weather isn't. Water is better at removing heat, flowing water is even colder still(to the touch)
My father has a background in being a kinder garden teacher so his entire life he did these types of things
When he taught in high school for example he would still do it with a few volunteers he found and just go through all the classes during the day and sharing some candies during classes because why not
It's a fun time for everyone
He used to play the Saint and all that but he's a rather well known figure around these places and turned to play a Piet because of it like 20 years ago
There appears to be not much available about everyday life in Belgium on YouTube, except for this one [
Maybe it's because Belgians don't think it is necessary to tell other people how good life can be in Belgium, if you don't mind the 5 (or is it, or 7) governments, the tax burden, the lousy weather at times, the traffic jams
There is more than beer, fries, mussels or chocolate, Brussel/Bruxelles, Antwerpen, Liège or Brugge, Mons
Oh yes
FIFA #1
Just saying
in Belgium at certain events we play the song les lac du connemara and swing hankerchiefs or whatever piece of white paper or cloth in the air
EDIT: also people in their final year of highschool pull all sorts of stuff like building baricades, fireworks, lewd chalk writings on  Chrysostomos/hundred days (till graduation)
oh belgians put a front door in your garden when you reach 40-50 etc
this is just how my school plays football
We also have Sinterklaas in Belgium (but in some parts it's Sint-Maarten)
Wait does Sinterklaas not come on 6th December in the Netherlands
Here in Belgium a few people (including me) do that as well
I wouldn't know why you wouldn't want to do that, it's so handy
He sticks around for a couple of weeks here too and the gift-giving happens on the night between thr 5th and the 6th (parents put the gifts after the kids are asleep so the kids will see them when they wake up on the 6th)
Leopold II
Leopold II, but that's hardly a secret at this point, especially on Reddit
I mean, compared to alot of other historical figures, that doesnt really sound like a "bad guy".
Exactly
he was a monumental cunt and this is why I listed him as "famous, but a really bad person"
* Deciding to be a centralised country at its start, while we should clearly have been a federation or confederation since the beginning
* In extension of that, forcing down French as single national language, making Walloon progressively disappear, and antagonising the non-bourgeois and non-aristocrat Flemish people
While I accept French as my native language, I would prefer if we had kept our historical Walloon dialects
*Colonisation of Congo was bad too, but I don't think dumb is the proper term to use for that case
Belgian confederation, like Switzerland
That sounds good, I like it
Small
we have 11 million people, which is more than Switzerland, a confederation, and its 8 millions inhabitants
Flanders has around 6,5 million people, which is bigger than a good deal of European countries, and Wallonia has around 3,5 million people, which is bigger than some European countries too
Brussels region has 1 million people
[Here is a map on the subject] is bigger than many European countries
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Austria, which, like Switzerland, are smaller than Belgium, are federations too
Theoratically it’s more democratic than a monarchy
In term of population, we are bigger than [all these countries]
For some reasons, people seem to assume that small territory means small population, yet, with the Netherlands, we are the most densely populated country of Europe
Belgium for its red letters, Iceland for its blue letters
Liechtenstein for its white letters on black backgrounb
Luxembourg and Netherlands for their black letters on yellow background
I think [the Belgian ones] are pretty great
The [old UK ones] are also cool
The stripy flags at the top and bottom took some getting used to because I found them very busy on a license plate
Now though, I really like it and it's also very recognisable
The [decal on plates from Salzburg] was particularly great to me because the lion on it looks just like the [Flemish lion] and the Austrian flag is the same as the [flag of the city Leuven] which is where I'm from
What a coincidence
Yes, when the plate is rather new the colour is pretty nice
Plus, it’s unique and easy to see who your fellow Belgians are on the road
They're very recognisable when you're on holiday and foreigners are very recognisable when your inside the country
I'm quite certain people from every country feel like their plates are "the norm" and "good looking" because we grew up with them and literally see them every day
That explains it
I've always found the German license plates very nice because the number combination is always very nice
Never knew this was because you have some kind of say in what the license plate should be
I also really like the [short plates] must be fun to get one of those
My favourite license plates are still those from Slovenia though
The green really pops and the shields look good, even from a distance (unlike those german circle things
I like license plates with special colours
You think
They're actually stamped metal, that's the nicest part
Most other countries seem to have flat printed ones now
Those are green here
I think Brussels and Antwerp will always see the most growth
They are the economic powerhouses of Belgium and the most populous
Antwerp is currently working on infrastructure, like massive projects, redesigning the 'ring around Antwerp', rebuilding pre-metro stations, redesigning town squares or making new ones, the same goes for parks, cycling routes etc
We also have Nieuw Zuid which is currently being build, and about 10 to 15 years ago we got massive projects a bit downstream on 'het eilandje', etc
In short, lots of projects
Skyscrapers are generally a rarity in Belgium, because it messes up the old city skylines
Iirc no building in Antwerp may ever be taller than the O.L.V. Cathedral
NIETS is hoger dan de kathedraal
A lot of countries or cultures have a national dance
We don't even have anything close
LGBT+ stuff in general
I don't really know that many people who are LGBT+, there aren't many spaces dedicated to us, and I certainly don't know of any near where I live
Typical French
Forgetting Belgium exists
I don't need it 90% of the time but when there is a heat wave it is really painful here
Sorry if I sound ignorant, but what do you mean by 'spaces dedicated to us'?
Happy cake day
Somewhere to go that's mostly for us
A common example would be an lgbt+ bar, for example
Somewhere to hang out with people like me and to meet them, etc
I'd never heard of this, so I guess your comment is right
We really lack in LGBTQ stuff
I write in cursive, so, there is never a line in lowercase cursive
Never used it with a line, maybe it is a Flemish thing ?
Yeah I do it the same
Flemish here, never saw anyone writing it with a line before
Didn't even know this was a thing
Yup, learned it like that too
We are taught to write z like [here]
Written, capital Z doesn't have a line but more of a swirl
That's how I leanred it
It is somehow common yes, but most of the time, since they are to honour family members, godfathers/godmothers etc
most people don't like them
Most of the time, you only see them on official papers, and don't know said second name of your friends and family (cousins, aunts/uncle, grandparents) members
I have a compound one that I don't like in my case, but that manages to refer to : my godfather, my former/ex-godmother, and 3 of my grandparents
They're quite common, thought I feel less common for the younger generation
I'm in my twenties, I don't have a middle name, most people around my age that I've talked to about second names do not have one
But I feel that for the generation of my parents it is super common
But I don't feel like their second name is really used in general
Then again, this is purely anecdotal, I don't know most of the young people in Belgium and I've never read a study/survey on it
Same here
I know someone and his second name is Squanto, like come on
I have no idea tbh
Saying "how are you" when you mean "hello". And answering "I'm great", even when they feel miserable
Going to a drive-through for all of their food - even coffee and donuts
Why
Edit: also not adding the taxes in the price that is displayed
How hard is it to show the price you actually have to pay
And your weird railway system
How they act towards their flag
I mean, most Belgian flags either have a big Jupiler, Red Devils or SportsDirect logo on them or have faded colours and it is no big deal
I don't mean that disrespecting a flag is ok, because of everything it represents
But I feel like sometimes letting the american flag touch the ground is the worse thing one could do in their life
Their love of guns, imperial units, truck culture (??? the average guy isn't even hauling anything most of the time man why that pickup ?), fast food culture, culture of waste (ever heard about recycling ?)
The pledge of allegiance is very unsettling
Children shouldn't have to do such a thing, and certainly not the part about god
What about freedom of religion and secularism
Sueing, I cut the roof of my mouth to some cereal
Sure the company
I trip from a wet floor in any company's building
Sue the company
Kissing your children on the mouth
Where i live it is always full
they have harvey kellog to thank for that (yes that kellog)
Waffles as breakfast food hurts me as a Belgian as well
Oh yes, it's not something exclusively american
It's just the first thing I thought about
I'm not talking for the rest of the country
It was a question about what I find an odd (american) habit
This was one
And no, I don't use this as a formula
I say it as a open question, otherwise I use hello
You use them
We have some McDonald’s “restaurants” with drive-thrus but I’ve literally never seen someone use them
??? No
We definitely don’t have any donut place with a drive through, and as far as a know also not a Starbucks or other coffee place with one
Sounds like a recipe for disaster tbh
But the drive throughs are so lazy, and why would one eat in his or her car
And about the taxes: what about poor people who have to count how much money they can spend in a shop
Don’t make it even harder for them
About the trains: you not having any railway system near you is actually exactly what I mean
But apparently, some children still get in trouble if they refuse do to it, depending the teacher or school
That's weird
There is always a line at my local McDonalds
A preference for local food is actually a global trend
*hour rant in somthing that once resembled Dutch about how miserable I feel*
Really
In 15 years I think I’ve seen like 5 cars at my local one (and we’re quite a big city, though)
Lol, up until 2 months ago we didn’t even have a Burger King in my country
I do but: nobody there
It’s so crumbly, I’d be annoyed with my car being dirty and touching the steering wheel with my greasy hands
Wait, actual restaurants have drive-thrus too
If that’s true, that’s honestly so sad
I’d rather just enjoy my meal in the restaurant
Your car get crumbly and dirty
You don’t have a proper table
You don’t have a fork and knife
Burger King bought Quick and the first one opened 2yrs ago in Antwerp
Omg yes it was KFC 2 months ago, isn’t it
Is dat al 2 jaar geleden en niet 2 maanden ofzo
That’s really weird
The main reason we didn’t have Burger King was apparently because of our strict food safety laws, because we already have 67 McDonalds and because we have what we call the “frituur”, which is kind of McDonald-ish but better and cheaper (and it’s not a chain, it’s all snackbars run by private owners)
So there actually isn’t any need for Burger King or KFC or those things
Oooh I see, you got me thinking actual restaurants had drive-thrus
My image of it - that I get from watching American YouTubers - is: they get the meal, park the car in the parking lot and eat the food there
Or they eat while driving
The parking one is so sad though, please just go inside and get a table
Eating in someone elses car
I’d be angry af if someone would do that in my car lol
You always get crumbles in your car, unions or salad falling out of a burger (except if you have one of those McDonalds burger that barely has vegetables in it)
Eating a sandwich always gives you crumbles, since good baguettes always crumble
[Havenhuis in Antwerp] by Zaha Hadid
There is a lot of room for interpretation as to what is "good, modern architecture".
The "MAS museum" could fit in the collection, so does the "JustitiePaleis" Antwerpen-Zuid, even the "HavenHuis".
Antwerpen seems to have plenty of examples of bad, contemporary architecture
But I'm no expert
Come and see for yourself
Talking for Antwerp
It's controversial one
Plenty of people who are not fond of it
I personaly feel like they could've done a better job with someone else
I do like het [MAS] as a building by itself in Antwerp, though it does stick out like a sore thumb and does not really fit in the area IMO
The [Court of Justice in Antwerp] is also one of the more modern constructions, but it's straight up r/evilbuildings material
in regards to architecture it makes more sense to call it contemporary
It's less confusing imo
No i think it is fine the way it is now
I too have seen Zondag met Lubach
In all seriousness it was a very valid point
No need to make one up if we already have [our own
Sidekick
Standard issue FNC
Special powers
[Daddy's Royal Airstrike]
My god what a change on Philippes part
That's a long way from the stiff and awkward rake we se nowadays
Maybe we should get him experiencing some of those G-forces again and loosen things up a little
Sidekick for me would be a talking dog
No in my school they mostly focused on things that happened my country during ww2
It's mentioned when we learn about the period around WW2 yeah
[this is what belgian dominance over the continent looks like ]
Atomium
Or that floating staircase
Please fellow belgians help me
The atomium in Belgium is pretty amazing
I live in the city with the original Manneke Pis, but no one recognises this
The [city hall] of my hometown (Leuven) is quite nice
A few of my personal favorites:
Antwerp central station
, Port authority building in Antwerp
, City hall of Leuven
, Church of Ostend
, Church of Dinant
Yes but for us this isn’t some random statue
This is the most well known statue in Belgium
This is our national monument
"It's sterile
The station in Liege is also a cool station
I guess door-to-door salesmen and the enforcement officer
In België is dat 'die wandelclub met de paarse frakken'.
We'll share this one with our buddies in the north: Black Pete
Sometimes I forget that there are places in the world where euthanasia isn't ethically accepted yet
This sounds familiar
So Americans being Americans
Nothing special to see here people
Remember those girls kidnapped by Kony in 2012
Just 2 weeks earlier his group has tortured and burned over 200 boys from a school but not a peep was heard about that
True it has deffinitly blown up over there the last few years
Thing is, we can perfectly keep him without making his entire face black
That's why it should change
That comment about the elves is deffinitly one I'm going to use if an American decides to interfere in foreign cultures again
If you've been told since you were a child that he's black because of chimney soot then it's weird to suddenly change your mind about it
But yeah it's fucked up and I'm glad we're changing it
Ate fries 4 times in a week
I ate chocolate, waffles and fries and I drank beer all in just a couple of hours
>I purposely lightly touched like hundreds of tourists walking on the cyclepath as well
I visited amsterdam in january and rented a bike and did this as well
I felt like a local
My SO kept saying I was biking like a madman
... why not
One time frituur, 3 times side dish
Restaurants do that, yeah
But I don’t go to a restaurant 4 times a week, not even once a week
The average Belgian eats fries once a week
Italians don’t eat pizza 4 times a week either
Can you hold conversations in German
Do you live in Germany
Can you vote in the German elections
No, that is not at all what he is implying
Erdogan's biggest supporters live in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany
Turkish citizens have it really bad right now and many don't vote for Erdogan, yet he keeps winning, partly because Turks living in Western Europe keep voting for him without having to face the negative consequences
Democracy doesn't work if the voters don't face any positive or negative consequences
It's a bit hard to remember exactly, because I was still in primary school during the first wave of aids and the earliest years of testing or campaigns
But on the same time I was one of the first groups of children that grew up with the idea "you should use protection, that's really not a bad idea".
For a long time, it's seen as an infection for [i]them[/i]: mostly gay man, probably also a focus on our black community, drug users, prostitutes
It took a long time to grow out of that
And obviously the stigma here (for the first 15-20 years) was that AIDS was no more or less than a death sentence
Especially the gay part wasn't really a value judgement (in the eyes of my generation)
I mean
Freddie Mercury and some of the kids around the block who died of it were still seen as victims, not as "bad gays".
For me, personally, the first time my point of view opened up a bit was with the Philadephia movie
I really believe that that movie was pivotal in making people realize that there was more about it than blacks-gay men-prostitutes
It could happen everybody
Hah, I never knew that
I still hear a remix of that phrase at parties from time to time
I find Spanish to be the most beautiful language in existence
I like German too when spoken with a deep voice
But thats probably because I like Rammstein
Absolutely love Danish
Swedish used to be my favourite, but The Killing really swung me
I'd have to say Finnish is my fav foreign language
It sounds like someone is doing a spell whenever they speak Finnish, sounds amazing
I'm getting sick of Americans and their "lol surrender monkey white flag frogs" shit towards France because Chirac back in the days told Bush to go fuck himself with his Iraq clusterfuck
I also don't like it when people insult Russia as a country or the Russian people just because their government sucks
I'm Belgian
the france surrender jokes are way overdone and frankly an insult to one of the few country who managed to overrun more than half of europe
To this day I refuse to acknowledge the fact that PIGS is a real acronym
I though human-ressource was too on the nose but this is straight up an insult
I see little to less advantage of throwing that kinds of insults
If that's your kind of entertaining yourself, go ahead, but it says more about the people saying it than the other side
Iceland, because I really like the country
And Germany in case of war related stuff probably
It's kinda like how I get tired about the "British are prude and posh" stereotype
It's bullshit
I used to be in a British raiding party back when I played WoW and we had so much fun
They often did banter because I was "that Belgian mainlander" but it was all with the utmost friendship
Exactly
There are so many more jokes to be made about the French
The surrender ones just don't make all that much sense
I quite like Monty Python
It should be properly timed though, only when it's actually about the Spanish Inquisition, and just as a little funny side reference, and not all the goddamn time
My parents have 4 kids
My 30yo brother,  my 26yo sister,  19yo me and 17yo sister
When talking about me and my younger sister,  my parents always used to say 'de kleintjes',  which translates to 'the little ones'
They sometimes still call me ''spookje'' (Dutch) which means 'little ghost'.
My name is Casper
I think you can make the connection
I was called Robbedoes, which is a cartoon character from "Robbedoes en Kwabbernoot". My sister likes to sing "Robbie Robbie Robbie Robbieeee, nanananananaaa" to the tune of Ruby by Kaiser Chiefs
My irl name is similar to Rob, which is also how I got my username here
Mon poussin and mon chaton
Leans my duckling and my kitten
My mom used to call me a mix of my actual name and Duimelijntje (Thumbelina), I really don't know why though :p
My mom calls me lolotteke
Mix of French (lolotte) and Flemish (-ke)
My mother always says "our Connor" instead of just "Connor".
(Connor is not my actual name)
Some names get "our", others get "the". "The" is only used for male names
Vrolijke vrolijke vriiieeenden, vrolijke vrienden daaat zijn wiiijj
My parents called us de klein mannen ( the little guys)
In the Antwerpse Kempen, they say "de klei(ne) mannen" = de little men
The second syllable is dropped so it sounds like "the clay men".
I love how my little brother has 10 cm on me and he'll always be my little brother
This sounds just so wrong
Die is female and kleine is male
It's either dien kleine or die klein
btw i know officially 'die' is used both for male and female words, but half of the dutch-speaking people still use the gendered version of it
Are you from the Kempen
I bet they say "de klei mannen" with no N.
Now I think about it, my uncles also say "our Connor".
Incorrect
Nonkel bob
Just on the edge, epic joke
Nonkel Bob
Nee dit is in (veel “dialecten” in) België zo
Dieje/diene grote, dieje kleine, dieje lelijke,... verwijst naar mannen
Gewoon “die” daarentegen verwijst naar vrouwen
zo een uitspraak maakt duidelijk dat je niet vertrouwd bent met de spreektaal in een groot gedeelte van het Nederlandstalige gebied
That's the way it is in 't "Aantwaarps".
Another example "die van ons" vs "dieje van ons".
Yep
I wanted to rehearse my German and it basically gave no info on the grammatical rules (nom/acc/dat
) even though it's essential
You're supposed to learn it by trial and error with Duolingo without any explanation; or you have to hope that the people in the comments are giving the right advice
well the standard language is based on the brabantian dialect
which makes even less sense for them to use that ughhgrgrgrgrg accent haha
Nepotism
Sigarettes
It’s unhealthy af and a massive cost for society
I was shocked when I visited Italy that there were cigarette butts everywhere
Yall have a serious littering problem
That too indeed
Healthcare, funded by tax money
It’s proven that the average smoker cost a lot more than the average non-smoker, due to illnesses they get from smoking
Alcohol is worse than for example weed so it makes no sense to make alcohol legal but to criminalize weed
[Article about the cost of smoking in Belgium]
> The social cost figures from the so-called SOCOST study show that smoking accounted for 727 million euros in direct costs in 2012 - doctor visits, hospital admissions and outpatient care
The patient takes about 10% of these costs for their own account, among other things via brake money, which means that 582 million euros are borne by society
The indirect costs, production losses due to diseases due to tobacco consumption, amount to 746 million euros, bringing the total social cost to 1
3 billion
That would mean about half a billion in "social benefit", but that is calculated without the intangible losses - the loss of years of life -, according to Van Camp and Hufkens
The SOCOST study calculated that in 2012 some 294,000 healthy years of life were lost due to tobacco use
At 40,000 euros, which, according to the European Commission, costs a lost year, one comes to the "hallucinatory figure" of 11
7 billion euros
If you add the social costs due to illness and disability to work and deduct the income from excise duties and VAT, the total cost of smoking in 2012 will remain more than 11 billion euros
The problem is that education doesn’t work
In the Belgian news yesterday: every day (!!) 6 minors end up in hospital because they drank too much
Then there’s also the hundreds of deaths caused by DUI
If education doesn’t even work when it comes to alcohol, how can we be sure that it will work with weed
Thank you, and my apologies on behalf of Belgium for this clearly mentally faded lad
pls move out of belgium
There are plenty countries where your dream state already exists,  in the middle-east for example
Alcohol shouldn’t necessarily be forbidden in my dream state, DUI should be forbidden in my dream state with a zero tolerance policy
I’m glad to move out of you think it’s okay to drive after drinking alcohol
That's a completely different topic though, you were clearly implying totally forbidding alcohol, weed, smoking, etc
We have werewolf, Diabolical Wolf, Saint Deer (with a Cross between the horn), a ghoul (Karmadog iirc),
Then we have faery (good and bad) who lives in the forest but also near the river
We also have Dwarf (Nuton)
**Lange Wapper**, a size-changing giant:
- Harasses drunks at night, first showing himself as a small figure, then growing ever larger and larger and chasing them
(IRL this would the shadow of streetlights growing larger and drunks mistaking it for a giant)
- Hides in baby cribs to steal breast milk, when found out he grows to such a size that he fills up the entire room
**Kludde**, a chained dog-like beast walking on his hind legs
Can take on other shapes as well
- Hides under bridges and in forests and harasses travelers walking past at night, announcing himself by rattling a chain
Once presented, he jumps on the back of travelers and forces them to carry him on their backs for the rest of the night
Come morning he disappears
Nuton is more of a kind of imp
Aside from living in caverns, it has more similarities with the Irish leprechaun in some ways : helps you and bring you good luck if you are nice with them, do some housecores/menial work
And can bring woe if you mistreat/disrespect them
They are very similar to the German Dwarf  , Imps are usually of demonic nature
Apparently it is
Never heard of *lutins* (imps/leprechaun) being demonic
Well Imp are not really helpful, Leprechaun are still mischievous (not helpful)
And most of our myth are similar to German one (we used to be closer to Germany)
You realize Santa Claus was based off of that tradition
But how else would you decorate your toilet room
I never claimed it was based ONLY on Sinterklaas
But there are simularities
Edit: reread my comment
I see the confussion there
Glad that I taught you something today
You don’t want to know the shitshow it’s been
:p Many people are extremely angry about it
In Belgium in particular, people feel as if we’re forced to conform to American sensibilities that are mostly irrelevant here
There have been countless polls among black people here, and almost none of them take offense to the way black pete is traditionally portrayed, yet we have to ‘modernise’ our tradition because how it looks internationally
Santa gives you coal
Yeah that might be the origin for that yes
Flemish people know about gender though
One sidenote: a neuter word in Dutch is not necessarily neuter in German and vice versa, for example, das Boot vs
de boot
(People might get confused with equivalent
Those are not articles, but personal pronouns
There are rules, but they are limited and many exceptions exist:  Anyway, I seldom hear native speakers get it wrong, but maybe it is not a coincidence the Flemish team used to win 'Tien voor taal' most of the time
Yeah we got taught the trick to figure out a word's gender
Whether you use "ne(n)" or "een" with a word
For example, you can use "nen auto" (a car) [masc
] but you can't say "ne kast" (a closet) [fem
I don't know why it is this way but it works
The definite article for plurals is always "de".
And yes, the ending changes, too
Whereas German has a whole truckload of different plural endings, Dutch is mostly restricted to -en or -s for plurals (with some exceptions, like 'kinderen' and Latin loans)
We do, but usually it's combined with a cycling network [(signs look like this)] In than case you may also find walking network routes [(sings look like this)] but these are less common, and you might find regular routes (either with their own sign, or with color coded signs)
Not really as you described
Daytime tv on (Flemish) public tv usually shows older movies
If it's foreign language movies, it is usually a) selected for their quality (having won an award or something) or b) Louis De Funès.
I liked Alert Cobra, it was a series but still it was German
I'm sorry you have to watch all those TV shows dubbed in German
Makes it even worse
Ah, Louis De Funès. Always reminding me I don't understand French as well as I'd like to
I liked the car crash
The Dutch stereotype that Belgians are stupid, despite the fact that statistically speaking, we have better education
Fits both categories
Funny since it's kind of ironic, annoying because it's utterly uninspired as far as stereotypes go
Imo the French people are the opposite of surrendering cowards, only the government could maybe deserve that stereotype
You're all construction workers and cleaning ladies
What about the ''muh belgium part france part Netherlands'' , that one is annoying as hell
And about the dutch saying you are dumb , here we Walloons have the same with the french ,even though you hear them say a lot of bs on tv
The french have the best military records in the entire history !
When we went to Italy with school one of teachers said that many Italians will refuse to wear shorts/general summer clothes until after Easter, at the earliest then even
We manage to form a governement !
Do we tho
Right now ? No !
But we had a government before ! And that's impressive for a country like ours X3
We already have a Monsieur patate so We'll pass X)

In the nineteenth century Ambiorix became a hero because of his resistance against Julius Caesar

Father Damien - a catholic priest
He won recognition for his ministry in the Kingdom of Hawai'i to people with leprosy
Some famous Belgian heroes:
Louis de Potter - Journalist who paved the way and was the *de facto* leader of the Belgian revolution
He might've become the first president of Belgium if history had gone a bit differently
Nowadays he has largely disappeared from public knowledge unfortunately
Ambiorix - King of the Eburones, managed to outwit and defeat one of Caesar's legions
Godfrey of Bouillon - leader of the first crusade and first king of Jerusalem
Adrien de Gerlache - Lead the Belgian expedition to Antarctica and was the first to winter there
Paul Henri-Spaak - Leader in the creation of the institutions that later became the European Union
He was also the first president of the UN general assembly and secretary-general of NATO
What a legend
My paternal granddather fought in WWII and was briefly a PoW
My grandfather fled from Congo during the Congo independence conflicts
A cousin from my grandmother's side did a suuuper extensive genealogy project and found some super old lines
I'm linked to a known and semi-famous [*Vlaamse Primitief*] and even older around 1100 there's some links to Danish nobility or something
I can't remember exactly
Most lines also gave location and profession
Nearly all of them from 1600 on were all in or around the town I live in now, still
Closer: great grandpa fought in WW2, got captured very quickly (because Belgium in WW2 wasn't really prepared for a blitzkrieg as you know)
Spent five full years in a Stalag, got sent to the hole, was forgotten for 14 days, took the uniform of a British pilot that died in the hole, got out
Was liberated by the Soviets in 45 (he weighed 28kg) had to walk back from the Czech-Polish border to Brussels where he was reported MIA/presumed KIA
Other grandparents had to house German guards in their farmhouse, mostly old and injured Eastern Front veterans who filled their days with strolling around the woods "patrolling" and playing cards
A US patrol checked the farm during dinner
The Germans immediately surrendered and calmly pointed to the food, which they then shared before marching off

All of Belgium's irresponsible drivers do compromise this reply
The day of the week the Donald Duck magazine arrived was a great day, think it was Wednesday
We had hundreds of those comics at home by the time I could read as my sisters are older
They were the first thing I ever binged, hard
But letting 8y olds shoot a gun, on the other hand, is completely save and should not be made illegal no matter what happens
In Belgium you can choose between a license for an automatic car or a license for both
If you do the exam with a manual car, you get one for both
If you do the exam with an automatic car, you get a license only for automatic cars
I’d say 99% of the people do it with a manual car
Yeah I'm sorry about that
As someone who has just gotten his drivers license I just prefer to take public transport as much as possible because driving yourself is just a source of stress and constant danger
We use a lot of English words like they're Dutch
Like 'nice', 'fuck/fucking', 'shit', 'chillen'(to chill) etc
They're not English words anymore to us
Un parking = a car park, a parking lot
Here we use smoking and parking too
Though in American English they say 'Parking lot' so it's not that far removed from 'parking'
A smoking is an actual word for a type of suit fyi
Ah okay, I misunderstood the reply you made to the other guy then
>Actually the influence of English on our language make people put in spacing in words that should be a compound
This is called the English disease in Dutch
I’m not really familiar with scams in Belgium
But there is an Irish/British scam in France I know about
My boyfriend and I experienced it last summer (and then after this read about it online)
Someone comes up to you really desperate, it can be a family or just one person, with us it was a young man from Ireland
He claimed to have all his stuff stolen in Bordeaux
Someone allegedly broke into his car
We were just listening at that moment, a little hesitant
We asked what he wanted and it was money for a ticket back to Ireland
He showed us his car, but there was nothing with the car
He opened the trunk, still in despair
To show us the trunk was empty because everything was stolen
There were some children’s and women’s clothes lying around so we asked questions about his living and family situation at home and why he was in Bordeaux
He wanted to give us his number and name
We could even call his dad to check
In the end he also needed more money then just for the ferry ticket
He would give it back once he arrived home
But of course you will never see your money back
Ever
Never give in to things like this
Just tell people like this to fix their problem with the ambassy or the police
Here’s another example of people who experienced this scam:
Those guys were everywhere remotely touristic is Lisboa
A guide told to us they sold literal rabbit shit
But yours makes way more sense
Why would anyone be bothered to collect that much rabbit shit, put it in a bag and try to sell it to tourists
Is ‘une bouteille’ also good
I don’t know how to pronounce that ‘un pichet’.
Man, thats a story
In all fairness its seems like an odd place but i have a Belarussian friend who is nice
Seems like there is some interesting stuff in the country just not a typical tourist haven
Thanks
- Language education starts too late
The older you are the more effort it takes to study a language
- Language education doesn't focus enough on using the language, although apperantly this has been somewhat improved since I left school
- Primary school doesn't group people by their ability
Students who are better at a particular subject can't excel, while those that need more help fall behind
- Secondary and tertiary education should flow into each other better
Students who know what they want to do should be able to hop into tertiary education quicker
Overall I think it could be a lot worse, I think the education system does most people well, I think fixing these four issues would result in massive improvements
Education in Flanders: heavy focus on learning French, German, English and optionally Spanish
Education in Wallonia: Do you want to learn English or Dutch
Sorry you have to choose one of the two
Oh woops
Seems like our school doesn't have any Dutch teachers
So English is good
>Language education doesn't focus enough on using the language, although apperantly this has been somewhat improved since I left school
I'm in my last year of high school now, and just this year and last year they started focusing more on using the language
Also: I'm Flemish and I have 3 hours of French now, and I think everybody has French untill their last year
Apparently in Wallonia, the last 2 years of high school you can choose if you want to get Dutch (which a lot don't want)
I think that's stupid that they don't learn that much Dutch when it's one of the main languages of the country
Yeah it's so stupid they get to choose for dutch when they become 16 while we are obligated to have 3-5 hours a week of french sometimes starting when we're just 9 years old
9 years
I started getting French when I was 10 or 11 (5th of primary school)
Although we did listen to some French songs and learned 'Bonjour' in the 4th year
As similar as you expect from a place that received Dutch settlers for over one century (the 1700s), but was then taken over by the UK 200 years ago (1814 -  )
It's a people with some inherited characteristics from respectively their Dutch, French, and British mother countries
From the Dutch they got their religion and language roots
Note that Afrikaans as a language is also spoken by a very large (larger than the white Afrikaners) ethnically mixed local group variably called Cape Coloureds -  (who are protestant too), Cape Malay -  (speak Afrikaans but took Islam along from Dutch Indonesia) or Griqua (mix of local Khoi with Dutch) -  . I can't go into the nuanced differences and similarities between white Afrikaners and Cape Coloureds
That's a novel in itself
From the French they received their wine-making expertise, but all the French settlers became Afrikaans-speaking
Still a lot of people have a French family name like *De Villiers*, but they pronounce their own name in hard Afrikaans (pronouncing all the letters of the word - DE VI-LI-JEERS, not like in French DE-VILJEE)
French pronunciation: First five seconds of this clip: "Bonsoir Philippe De Villiers, Merci
" -
Afrikaans: At second 10 of this:
From the British they got their tea drinking habit, and a fondness for cricket and rugby, but the British are seen more as oppressors while the Dutch never were seen as oppressors
That's also a novel in itself
Because of the isolation from the 'mother country', several  characteristics were frozen in time
Afrikaners are still majority practicing Reformed Protestants, most of them as member of the NG Kerk (Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk -  )
Afrikaners are more religiously conservative while the Netherlands became strongly secularized along with the rest of Western Europe
Dutch opinions on abortion, elective euthanasia, soft drug use, acceptance of atheism are foreign to (most) Afrikaners
Besides the deep British influence (as mentioned: tea, cricket, rugby), you'd have to add a big sprinkle of what Europeans would call "American" traits
- They do their shopping in large shopping malls
- They drive everywhere, even if it's one street over to a neighbour
- They have a historical culture of gun ownership (although the SA government gradually introduced strict registration laws on gun ownership)
- Contrary to Europeans, Afrikaners fall much more on the "privatize it"/"it's your personal responsibility" spectrum when it comes to education, healthcare insurance, or pension insurance
As a consequence, South-Africans pay through the nose for their private schools (if they can afford it), private healthcare plans (as in the US offered by the employer if you're lucky), and private saving for your pension
- And the Evangelical brand of Protestantism is also seeping into South Africa
NG Kerk calls them "the happy clappys".
True
I didn't want to go too deep into why you drive everywhere (the distances are larger for starters, plus it's a lot safer), nor into the complicated reason why affordable social security (healthcare, education) is not really an option because the high unemployment makes it so there actually isn't a big enough tax base to fund it all
As you know that opens up the can of worms of the sorry state of S.A.'s public healthcare
(By the way, I'm married to a South African and visit frequently, so it's how I picked up these nuggets about S.A. over the years
Steamed chinese buns
My recipe wasn't the best but I was still surprised by how good they were
Went on camp with my youth group in Hungary
We stayed in a random small town, and an old lady made us a huge pot of goulash
I don't think we got any more Hungarian than eating grandma's authentic goulash with your feet in the Danube
Liege waffles are a bit too touristy I think
We only made waffles when we had too many eggs at home
But vol-au-vent and stoofvlees are regular and absolutely amazing dishes
Stew is always good but I have a soft spot for my own country's ones :)
Same
We went for Georgian food a lot in Kiev, it was heaven
The country is definitely on my to-visit list after that
I like em now too but they take quite a while to make but I read you can after steaming them freeze them and later microwave them so if you can make enough in one go it's probably a lot more interesting
Our old garden used to have a fuck ton of cucumber plants
We always ate em raw as snacks, gave them away, ate them with every meal and still we had too many
So we made cucumber soup
It wasn't bad, but raw was still better
Nothing to do with the meaning of the flag
But our belgian flag has been unconstitutional since the beginning of our country
The constitution discribes it as 3 horizontal lines, but the flag is allways and everywere presented vertically
Altough i think they changed it recently
It sounds like a joke but it isn't a joke
For me, it's the red next to the black
The gold should be there to separate the two
It's more balanced this way imo
Also uncommon ratio's get extra points in my book
Some of these posts are made by bullies
It's not a game if you can't get hurt but others can
"Striptease ball game" - You had to stand in a circle, your legs had to be spread and your left and right feet had to touch the feet of the children left and right of you
You had to try to make a "goal" by kicking a ball between someone's legs
That other person had to prevent this by kicking the ball away with one of his legs
If you lose (when someone makes a goal between your legs), you had to remove a piece of clothing
You were not allowed to remove your underpants or shoes
Socks and shirts and pants etc
were all allowed
"Who is afraid of Big Bertha
" - You had to stand in a line on one side of the field
One person is standing in the middle of the field
He is called Big Bertha
He shouts: "Who is afraid of Big Bertha
" Then everyone else shouts: "NOT MEEEEEE
" and tries to run across the field
Big Bertha then tries to lift someone up
Then there are two Big Berthas etc
Eventually only one child remains
The game ends when even he gets lifted
That's belleke-trek in Belgium, and knock-down ginger in the UK
Sounds like "bundle
" in the UK

I don't think Charleroi is that well-known
Their airport is even called Brussels South Charleroi Airport despite being 70 km from Brussels
It could be surprising but many people know Bristol
And that’s because of the TV show Skins
I discovered this city with this TV show and many others did too
Yeah, I don't get it either
Yes
And tbf, it is a very ugly city
I didn't even know that
Kind of weird that Charleroi would get a metro and not Antwerp (although it has a premetro)
The opinions on le Nord they painted in Bienvenue chez les Chti’s weren’t exagerated, were they

That it takes a looong time to really befriend a Belgian
Don't get me wrong tho, once you have a Belgian friend, you have one for life
But I've heard about people having a difficult time befriending people here
Why though
Spanish, along with most regions of France, are some of the nicest, most laid back people I know
And Spanish people absolutely love it when I at least try to speak Spanish when on vacation over there
I thought the stereotype was that no matter who is president, you're always gonna think he sucks :)
I can say that the stereotype of "Frenchies being rude" is untrue though
I always feel welcome in France when I go there on vacation
&#x200B;
On vous aime, mes frères :-D
Apparently we are seen as distant and serious and a little dark (humour wise - it's the flag, isn't it, or is it Congo
In all seriousness though I think it's because of that little sentence branded into out culture: "Denkt eer ge spreekt
" (Think before you speak)
Belgians tend to hold you accountable to what you say
(Which is, amongst others, why all other political parties tell the racist party to go fuck itself here)
During the hot days this summer(like 35+°C) we just left our construction workers home
They're not working in those temperatures, period
Yeah, that seems logical
I've seen a video of Americans visiting Belgium and one think they thought was really weird is that Belgians stare a lot
Which is true, I guess we like to try and see what kind of person he or she is
(Also, when 2 Belgians like each other in let's say a club, they will stare at each other first to make sure they both are interested, I can confirm this btw)
Well, that's the thing, we appreciate such honestly :D (As long as it's not rude ofc)
We have our fair share of austists I guess
Our constitution dates back to 1831, but it has changed a lot since then
We have had 6 big State reforms from the 1960s to 2010s. That's about one every decade
These reforms transformed Belgium from a unitary country to a federal one
Now basically everyone agrees that it's a mess, and a new very large State reform is planned for after the 2024 elections
The process to amend the constitution is the following:
- The government and a simple majority in parliament must agree on what articles of the constitution to modify
- Then new elections are called
- The new parliament has to agree to the amendments (only to the articles that have been opened to change) with a 2/3 majority overall, and at least a 50% majority in each linguistic group (French and Dutch speakers)
In order not to call new elections all the time, the parliament usually votes on the articles to modify at the end of the legislature, right before the elections
So the next parliament has the possibility to make amendments without calling new elections
My girlfriend is French and pronounces it as ski-well in English
In Limburg they say einbiegel
Ain-beegel like a bit German
Anybody know where it came from
Eekhoorn= eek+hoorn
As a native French speaker, I can confidently say that I can't confidently pronounce it
That word is impossible to pronounce for me
If I had to say it, I would substitute something else for it, like "small animal" or something
It's absolutely the r sound
It's a sound that doesn't exist in French and while I have learned it, sometimes, it trips me up and I think it's probably the fact it's between two vowel sounds, not entirely sure
Actually, I'm good enough at English to not have a French pronunciation like that but it's just one of those words that just trip me up
The English r doesn't exist in my language
I'd say that counts as unusual enough for it to be hard to pronounce
I honestly don't know
There's just something about it
I know it's the sounds that surround it that make it difficult for me to pronounce, but I don't know why
Yes, I can, just not together
Belgium doesn’t recognize Palestine as a state, which is pure bullshit imo
It's so dumb
I always thought a lot of countries didn't recognise Palestine untill I saw a map of it
It's basically just Europe, the US and Canada that don't recognise them
Palestine is recognised way more than Kosovo
Weapons is a difficult issue though
Wallonia here in Belgium sells a healthy amount of weapons too and a non insignificant part of that to the Saudis
But if we didn't sell them weapons, what do you think would happen
Countries like Russia will fill the vacuum and get the profits
So not only would our moral stand barely make a difference in terms of access for the Saudis, we'd also indirectly be sponsoring Putin and allow him to expand his influence
All in all, I don't like the fact that we sell weapons to Saudis but I'm pragmatic enough to realize that it's our best option right now
>Where do you draw the line then
I don't know
I'm no expert at geopolitics
>It's either all or nothing
That's a false dichotomy
You being in the EU means you decide what the EU tells you
>It is all or nothing
You keep saying this but you give no actual argument as to why that is
Why can't Belgium (for example) decide to sell to the Saudis and not to North Korea
Should North Korea sue us because we're breaking some law
Note: I'm not saying I'm against selling weapons to NK either
I'm simply disagreeing with your "well if you sell to X then you are obligated to sell to everyone" logic
Feel free to explain to me where I'm wrong though
> You say you're not d'accord with selling weapons to North Korea because the state there kills people who do not obey
I never said that I am against selling weapons to NK though
No entrance exam here
You have a secondary school diploma
You can enter any university you want, no elitist and selective bullcrap here
No such thing as entrance exams here except for medical stuff
You finish high school, you go to college
The end
Culture is I would argue really laid back when it comes to what you're talking about
In high school you can as years progress make more and more choices, by 11th grade we're talking about hundreds of options
Everything from car mechanic and electrician, to sports, IT, languages, science, etc
Now you take that knowledge if you want to college and just start there
I did an IT direction, very math heavy for obvious reasons
One of the first classes for my economics degree was financial algebra
I didn't have to study a lot at all for that class because of my background back in high school
So again, no matter the degree from high school, you can begin nearly everything
But that doesn't make it a good idea
My financial and math/IT background means that to succeed in a language aimed one I would need to do some studying for a year just to catch up
Upside: You're busy more with the things you prefer
Making that what you wish to do easier as it's spread out over more years
Not having to study financial algebra meant I had more time with some other classes, though again, many of the first classes were repeat for me
Downside: harder to change midway through
While I did IT I had to change schools that didn't offer it
I had to study 4 years of German to get my degree for economics, something that wasn't given when I took IT
Though harder, it's of course still possible
So most "private tutors" at a college level will be people trying to improve what they want to get into or people who want to switch what they want to do and need a new basis to have an easier time succeeding
My uncle did languages in high school but wanted to go into banking so he took private lessons to get his math up before starting college
But it's rather rare
Except for medicine
If you want to study for doctor or dentist, you nees to do an examn and only the best x people can start
Yes, you can start studying medicine just by applying
Why couldn't you
Why would there be a need of a selection process
Anybody that has a secondary school diploma can do that, unless he/she has a professional/vocational secondary school diploma, that is, one that teaches you directly a job
The idea of doing anything STEM related and not being able to speak English is kind of odd
I did IT in high school and the English teacher was very blasé, assuming we knew English
The guy who spoke French at home(Algerian family) actually had a lot of issues with it because of that
In Flanders you have an entrance exam for medicine, though
Yes
Maybe it's different in Wallonia though, idk
But I doubt it
That may very well be in Wallonia-Brussels Federation too, but it is likely one of the only very few ones where it is the case
Wallonia doesn't have an entrance exam
It has been a point of contention between the Flemish and Wallonian regional accreditation departments for several years now
Oh wow that's... weird
It's mostly a matter of further education opportunities
For specialising their are only limited spots
So in Flanders they made a selection exam, so students who finish their studies can, with reasonable certainty, find a specialisation and a job
In Wallonia students are more likely to have worse job prospects after graduating, because there are more students starting, than there are available spots, and they more often have to go abroad to finish their education
I place them in the fridge, but supermarkets just store them at room temperature
Language (Dutch VS French)
Which beer is the best
Most of them are great god damn it, you're wasting time arguing which could be better spent drinking beer
Frieten, it's called a frietkot, not a patatkot
If u say patat you have mental problems
>According to it's protesters, it is a racist version of blackface
Early stories definitely speak of a "kroesharige neger" and "den zwarten knecht" so it's hard to argue it's not racist
But there's an easy solution a lot of places employ here in Belgium, not sure if it's the same in the Netherlands
Zwarte Piet is just portrayed with smudges of dirt on his face instead of full black face
That makes sense if the explanation is that he enters through chimneys
Both people who think it's racist and people that want to preserve Zwarte Piet as a concept should be happy (unless they specifically think the fully black face is necessary in which case they're likely just racist)
Not really we call mashed potatoes just "purree"
It's potatoes prepared in a particular way, no need to specify what it's made from, same stuff why you don't call a steak "cow steak"
Jij connais die /r/BELGICA sprache
There is no "Belgian" language
"Flemish" is very close to Dutch and the "Belgian French" only has a few subtle differences with "France French". And there is "Belgian German", but it's a really small area of the country
Guess you could also call them frietuur, still, frietuur not patatuur
Why would you say patatzaak when it's obviously called frieten
I guess you're right
Is this song also a tradition on weddings
Here in Belgium it's always played at least once and people start swinging their napkins around
Scandalous
Herman van Veen is fantastic
That's so weird because I'm Flemish, and it's obviously a French song, but I've not been to a wedding where it wasn't played, song's a lot of fun though
I have never used a train internationally, the cost is too high to me (money and time wise)
If it became cheaper I definitely want to take the train more
However I do try to avoid going somewhere on a plane, I'd much rather drive there
I love driving to holidays, you have the freedom to go where you want, when you want
This is not possible with either train or plane
Also the drive itself can be so fun, putting on music while driving along beautiful sceneries
I love it
My choice between the train of a plane is seldom made for time or cost reasons
I must add, I travel most of the time between Antwerpen and Toulouse, or Agen
Flying means you can hardly take any luggage, which on top of that does get "lost" once in a while
The flight to Toulouse (from Zaventem) will take roughly 6 hours in total
On the train, I take a large(r) suitcase and some hand luggage without a problem
TGV train to Toulouse or Agen takes about 10 hours in total
For longer distances and short (business) trips, it's almost certainly going to be "flying". All I probably have/had with me is/was another shirt/suit, toothbrush, undies, laptop
For longer trips and holidays, I typically rent a car, so I can take whatever luggage I want, go where I want, when I want
We should create an EU wide train company and have the Swiss be in charge of it
And since the Swiss aren't in the EU we can't claim they're biased
I'd say that would qualify as a car ride
Thanks to watching Scandinavian fiction I understood your two comments
I'm not saying it doesn't help
But a lot of it (when written) is quite understandable
I speak (Flemish) Dutch indeed
English reading is "perfect", speaking will always have some sort of accent
I can read and understand enough German to know what a sentence is about or get the gist of it
Speaking and writing, not so much and I should actually take it up again
I like the sound if Scandinavian languages/North germanic a lot
Except for Danish as it indeed sounds like a strange bastard between yours and whatever is going on
Would actually love to learn Swedish/Norwegian
French movies: the accent
Other movies: well they don't really portray us
For some reason, Hollywood is convinced we all speak French
We don't. More than 60% of the population speaks Dutch
We're not portrayed often, but when we are, movies tend to give the impression that we are mainly French speaking, even though the majority has Flemish/Dutch as a first language
They even do this when they are in Flanders
Zurich I'm guessing
About siestas, the region I went to multiple times, they definetely had siestas in the surrounding villages, shops (maybe except that one supermarket) closes from 2pm to 4pm (ish, it has been a while) but stay open until 10pm, it was a surprise when I walked about 6km for a pharmacy that was close in the afternoon
Thanks for the input
Siesta was the first thing that come into my mind, not the midday nap
But rather a "resting time"
If you live in Belgium and can't ride a bicycle, you're probably disabled
I can, I think I was 5 or so when I learned it without the side wheels
I was 4
Everyone here knows how to bike, except for my dad maybe
He was already too fat when I was 5-6 so I've never known him to ride a bike
He used to though
Yes I can ride a bike, probably started learned very young
Can't put an age to it, first as a todler I had the [mini plastic todler bike with four wheels] or the [three wheel bike] those were just for around the house
Then I guess between the age of 3 and 6 I started with a normal kids bike with two extra support wheels in the back until the time came that my dad decided I could do without
&#x200B;
In Belgium it's super normal that everyone can ride a bike
At least in the countryside it is, but I assume in the city too
I know one person who couldn't really ride a bike, he learned it as a kid, but because he never actually did it (probably for 10-20 years) he kind of forgot how and had to learn it again
But that's honestly the only Belgian person that I know of that couldn't ride a bike (and I think now he can again and he did actually learn as a child)
I grew up in a cul-de-sac almost so I was basically on wheels since I was like 2
Learned it without side-wheels when I was 4-5 I think
Don't think I know anyone that can't ride one
Disabled people and such, immigrants
Riding a bicycle, swimming, reading, knowing the the sun is a star, etc
are all things I assume an adult knows and can do
And if you live in the Netherlands you're probably a prick anyway
The Dutch and their "humor"
Honestly, the Roman empire could provide one of the best stories
There's war, there's scheming, conspiracies
Basically play EU 4
That will do the trick
Dutch people are called de kezen, de kazen , roughly the same as the cheeses because they are known for making cheese
Hehe, that river's name means fart in French
I think you mean 'kaaskoppen'
Who doens’t like some good old Gouda boys
We learned about Hitler trying to get the power and failing -> going to jail and writing a book -> his party becoming popular and Hitler becoming the leader -> WW2 and Holocaust
Here they say it started in 1940, because that's the year belgium got invaded
The flemish loves to remember the battle of the golden éperons ( not sure how it is translated in english), the moment where they murdered the french army because the french can’t pronounce « schild and vrienden »
In wallonia Nationalist like ... Idk they aren’t really that much nationalist, but probably the strong monarchy and the pre-WW1 period
That time in the 14th century that we as a bunch of farmers defeated the mighty French army
Do germans celebrates Luther ?
Which is funny considering Flanders as we know it today and Flanders in 1302 are 2 very different regions
Belgium: duck, quail, pigeon are readily available in supermarkets and are not uncommon in restaurants
Goose is limited to foie gras, I've never seen actual goose meat for sale
Turkey as well
It's very good meat actually
Tastes amazing
Yes they are, the dish is also forbidden as it was seen as animal cruelty
Haha no I haven't. But if I remember correctly, the dish is supposed to be eaten with a napkin over your head
Charleroi is called the ugliest city in Belgium, and even of entire Europe
Did you know you can book a safari through Charleroi
Even if you are blind en deaf, you can smell the ugliest town of Europe
Only for masochists and the obsessed of the real ugly:
Charleroi in Belgium is often considered the worst looking city
It's juts like of many cities that heavily relied on coal
A lot of wallonian cities:
Charleroi  elected the ugliest city in Europe, Liège, Châtelet, La Louvière which  has a large urban canker still not rehabilitated for a dark conflict  between the city and a developer, Seraing, Mouscron, Verviers, Louvain  la Neuve (a new university town with lots of concrete and no charm)
For  most of the cities mentioned, the industrial past, the economic slump,  the total lack of architectural cohesion and the fact that the wealthy  locals who never want to live in the city center explain this without  speaking of the Mosan art which I find quite enough
ugly
In Flanders the towns are much more beautiful but Genk and the seaside resorts are also hideous though
This one surprises me
Looking at pictures, it seems somewhat nice
It's a good song
A Dutch-language cover of it (Zoutelande) was huge in Belgium and the Netherlands
When I speak Flemish, I get mocked for having a French-ish lilt, and when I speak French, I get mocked for the Flemish tone
Oh the bane of being a Brussels sprout
I was living in France when I was 15-16, and they seemed very amused with the way I said the word "huit" (8)
Not really know, I'm from the part of the country which speaks the standard accent you hear on TV and radio (Brabant and French-speaking Brussels, formerly part of the same entity)
Thus, we would be the ones doing the mocking I suppose
Yes, I'm from the province of West-Flanders
1)In our accent we basically pronounce G's as H's and H's sometimes a H's and sometimes we leave them out
So we're known for not being able to pronounce G's, or not being able to pronounce the difference between a G and an H. This is very confusing to others
2) The infinitives of verbs in Dutch end on -en (pronounced like 'un'): dansen (to dance), zingen (to sing), lopen (to run), etc
Many regions (both in Flanders as in the Netherlands) just drop the -n at the end: danse, zinge, lope
But West-Flemish people drop the -e: dans'n, zing'n, loop'n,... (using a glottal stop)
This sounds apparantly very funny to others
In general we're known for having an accent and dialect that is super difficult to understand by others
Also the entire province has the image of being the countryside full of cows and every West-Flemish person is a farmer, harvesting potatoes, we barely have electricity/internet/... and out toilets are still outside
&#x200B;
As a student I studied in Ghent (province of East-Flanders), some differences and funny things were pointed out
But Ghent is full of West-Flemish people (students and ex-students who didn't leave) so overall they're quite used to it and it's not too big of a deal
When I was a student in Antwerp (province of Antwerp) it was a way bigger thing; there are also way less West-Flemish people there
First of all communication was more difficult
But on multiple occasions I had people laugh with my accent because they thought it was funny
It wasn't really meant in a mean way
But sometimes it can be quite annoying if a conversation is interupted because someone couldn't answer the question because they were noticing how funny my accent was and didn't actually listen to what I said, or they were laughing (not out loud, more on the inside) so they couldn't immediately reply
As a West-Flemish person I am very aware of the fact that I pronounce certain things wrong, I'm pretty sure almost all West-Flemish people are aware if this
But it did quite bother me that on a few occasions when I was talking to a person in Antwerp and I addressed the fact that Antwerp people pronounce their vowels wrong (said with no ill intentions, just as part of a discussion about pronunciation/accents) they denied it, said that I was wrong, total disbelief
I kind of felt like they didn't take my opinion on the matter seriously because of my West-Flemish accent
While pretty much every West-Flemish person is aware that we pronounce certain things wrong, apparently Antwerp people don't necessarily all know about the flaws in their own accent
Don't misunderstand me, I've met Antwerp people who did know, I just feel like less people in Antwerp are aware of their own pronunciation shortcomings in comparison with West-Flemish people
I also don't mean this as hate towards Antwerp or people from Antwerp, I had a great time there and I think the people there are just about as friendly or unfriendly as anywhere else
It's just something that bothered me
This one I never get, how different is Belgian *huit* from French *huit*?
It's only the Flemish that will be under water, here in wallonia it's Okey ^^
- *Comme même* ("like even") instead of *quand même* ("when even") (*quand même* means : still/anyhow/anyway/even so)
- Mixing up *c'est* (that is) and *s'est* (indicates the reflexive/pronominal form of a verb)
- Mixing up the *-er* (infinitive form) ending, *-é* (past participle) ending and *-ez* (indicative present, 2nd plural person) ending
The dreaded dt-error
The [d/t error]  is a killer in Dutch,
Damned final obstruent devoicing
But honestly, I don’t get why people keep making this mistake
It’s not like it’s irregular, you just have to follow the rules
When in doubt, use the verb ‘smurfen’.
Oh yes
How could I have forgotten it
> Autant pour moi instead of au temps
Both are accepted: www

"Comme même" occurs more in written form around here, but it isn't one you see very often

I prefer fokschaapshit, it rolls well off the tongue

Social security is not linked to nationality but to where you contributed to the social security
So if an French person comes to work in Belgium, he will contribute to the Belgian social security and thus be eligible for Belgian social services such as unemployment, healt insurance, pension etc
If he moves back to France and continues working there, he will still be eligible to receive a partial pension from Belgian for the time he contributed there

It was really pretty and cool
I had never seen that many huge buildings in one place
Especially this walkway thing that was up in the air and between buildings that I don’t remember the name of
My feet did hurt at the end of that trip, though
Apparently the grid system is the worst possible option for traffic flow
I always laugh with the Quebec translation of the movies, for example in France or Belgium Cars stays Cars but in Quebec it is named "Les Bagnioles" what literally means the cars but with a more familiar word
And a totally different example the trilogy The Hangover is named Very Bad Trip in France and Belgium (yes it stays in English) and the Quebec translation is "Lendemain de soirée" which literally means "the day after the party".
Here in Flanders movie titles are normally only translated for Flemish-dupped movies, which only exist for kids and family movies, and even then it doesn't always happen (Cars, Frozen, Onward)
If you are going to watch the English version, the name stays the same
Most translation I know aren't that funny but rather accurate, except for one
A bug's Life (which is mostly about Ants) is named "Een luizenleven", which literally would translate to "The life of a lice".
However, "een luizenleven" is also a proverb for "an easy/comfortable life".
Not from my country since we almost never translate titles or dub, except for children's movies, but I now that Home Alone is "Maman, j'ai raté l'avion" (Mommy, I missed the plane) in France
For some reason, iirc, the Disney movie "Treasure Planet" was called "Schatten planeet" in the netherlands, a direct translation, but in Flemish it was called "Piraten Planeet" (guess what that means)
Not sure why
This is funny xD
Meh, some theft but that's it
My laptop, car stolen from my parents, car broken into while on the beach in France
Obviously bike stolen several times, most of the times we found it again
That's about it I think

Here is a song from Wallonia (Belgium)
This is from the "Ti T'chapias" wich means "little hats". The song is about drinking typical Walloon beers
[Ti T'chapias - Vive la Wallonie]
"Gestapo Knallmuzik" has top hits in pretend-German, it's basically Dutch with German pronounciation and intermittently some small German words, like [Angela Merkel] a "love ballad", or [Heel die Tag Pörno] or [Claudia Schwiffer]
I apologies to all German speakers for this
'Zeil je voor het eerst' and 'De Marie-Louise' by Bart Kaëll
Anything from Samson & Gert  (but mostly 'Ochtendgymnastiek', 'Samsonrock' and 'Bij de Brandweer') and Plop ('De Plopdans')
For the people from Antwerp: Katastroof, mostly known for 'Met de wijfen niets als last' and 'zuipen', but also for 'Dansen met de Paterkes' en ''t bed van tant' Janine' ([for the Dutchies]
[this] song its about going home with some woman but suddenly she has a dick and you don't want to be rude so you fuck her rough in her hairy ass
Probably [Angela Merkel] or [Kachelwinkel Peeters] by Gestapo Knallmuzik
It’s flemish people singing in very bad German, and it’s honestly fantastic
Well, even though it's pop/commercial music, I like some songs of Stromae
Also anything from boef and Watskeburt from de jeugd van tegenwoordig
Its about not being able to have sex whit a girl cuz she is 17
First of all
Really good song
Second of all, they are American

don't forget the most famous dutch meme, g e k o l o n i s e e r d
Shaking hands is a formal thing here in Belgium -> first meetings and the like
Or if you meet somebody at a party(I'm mainly thinking about business stuff here)
So not a regular thing with the same person
Say a colleague doesn't get more than a greeting
A hug seems more gay to me than a kiss on the cheek, I mean it's just your cheeks touching, you don't put your lips on them, that would be weird
Lol I understand what you mean by double shake
I'd feel fine hugging both men and women too but that's more intimate to me
It's like actually putting your lips on someones cheek, you don't do it when you meet but when you're celebrating or something
I can't imaging meeting my friends and hugging them lol
I've had dogs, cats, rabbits, kangaroos, horses, donkeys, all sorts of birds, from the small little twerps to big parrots and chickens, goats, sheep, all sorts of fish, etc
over the years
Currently about 100 chickens since April or something, 1 cat, 3 dogs and a pond of Japanese koi probably worth about 50k.
I'm allergic to both cats and dogs
Very annoying I tell you
I'm allergic to both but dogs look so much nicer than cats, even though I'm kind of afraid of dogs
I don't walk my cat, but during lockdown when there were no cars, my cats decided that they were going to join me on walks
They quite often just walked 2 kilometers about 3 meters behind me while yelling constantly
Love them goofballs
I remember something like that but it was further explained that people usually have 2-3 cats while for dogs it was closer to 1 or 2
We used to live in the center of a block so if you followed the path you would end back at our house
When we walked the dog our cat would follow us jumping in front of the dog as if taunting him that he wasn't on a leash
When washing the car we would often see the dog leaving on one side of the house and a bit later arrive at the other side
I'm a weird one in that case I guess
We have 3 dogs and 1 cat at the house
Two dogs for the parents(the calm ones), one for my sister(dancing/agility dog), cat is mine(brittish shorthair, calm one that crawls on my back when I'm sleeping sometimes)
Belgium has officialy 3 languages  dutch, french and german
Nobody knows where these german speaking belgians live, nor have we ever encountered one
For years there are stories about people that have met them
Some believe these stories others  believe they are myths
We got quit some dialects that aren't spoken anymore and our German community is also pretty small
We have other languages too though
Walloon is still spoken by a couple hundred thousand people, making it a larger language than German in Belgium
Other regional languages are mostly dead or almost dead
Living in Limburg I sometimes hear some Limburgish from other people
Officially it's classified as a regional language based on Dutch, but it's just as similar to German
Different versions of Wikipedia in languages spoken in Belgium, so you can easily compare them:
- [Dutch]
- [French]
- [German]
- [Walloon]
- [Picard]
- [West-Flemish]
- [Limburgish]
- [Luxembourgish]
These are all officially recognised native languages in Belgium which have their own Wikipedia
A lot of them are endangered or at least losing speakers as time moves on
Languages like Luxembourgish are spoken in only a few communities in Belgium, but more common in other countries
Dialects of Dutch, French or German were not included, but especially Dutch has a lot of strong dialects
Belgium only recently embraced its language diversity
In the past it was keen to classify different languages as dialects of French or Dutch, and forcing people to study those instead
Especially Walloon suffered from this
Although it still has a good chunk of native speakers, they're mostly growing old
The language has been nearly completely wiped out in favour of French
The languages spoken in the North have adapted to the Dutch that the speakers were made to study, becoming gradually more similar to Dutch
I could be wrong, buy isn't there a language called Northumbrian in Northern England
Don't forget the dialects of West-vlaanderen
I feel like Flemish we have some of the most extreme dialects in Belgium
Like if I go to Aalst I'll just give up on understanding people
I think it was from one of your earlier visits
Picard(chti is a synonym) isn't a dialect nor a patois it's its own sister language, the fact it is called patois comes from the francisation that made it look like it is inferior
Provençal on the other hand is a dialect , but from the occitan
Edit: The situation of Picard is the one of many other languages in France , like walloon , occitan ...  Unfortunately
Ja jongens jullie en Oost Vlaanderen zijn de enige die nog dialect praten
There's so much detail missing
I didn't mean to say Belgium recognises them, only Dutch, French and German are officially recognised by Belgium
For instance Limburgish is recognised and funded by the province, cooperatively with our friends over the border
Sadly, our Flemish overlords keep wanting to take away our right to do these things
The European Union also officially recognises Limburgish
Wallonia and the Netherlands have a much more reasonable language policy
Yea he was joking I think, because the comment he replied to was also joking
Wat ? Mij uitmake voor een west vlaming, Trots gentenaar hier hahha
>  I just checked some texts in [Picard] and I understand everything so yeah, it does sound like a dialect now
It does because it comes from the same continuum dialectal and are from the same language family
Furthermore, you've probably seen a text in "picard" in the french litterature sense , which is french litterature **but with words coming from local languages** ( there are examples with provençal and champenois, or even anglo normands), which isn't Picard as of the language itself
That or you've seen a ''bastardized'' version that is more commonly spoken today because of francisation incentives from the french government and belgian alike
(probably option 2, as there is mention of 2016 in your link)
> Do you know some versions of picard without francisation ?
No unfortunately , as i'm not a picard , and even after having searched , i could only find [This] which is medieval , but isn' easily readable
> They make a confusion with gallo, a french dialect from the East of Brittany (my grandparents speak it)
Gallo has not as much consensus than picard , but it seems that it's more considered a separate language too

So basically what I learned here is that nobody knows which exact countries form the Balkans regions
If you count Greece as a Balkan country, there's no reason not to include Turkey
Greece is in the Balkan peninsula, so it is fair to include it
Istambul can be partially included as it spans over both sides of the Bosporus, but wether or not it can be seen as the most important city I would say depends on whether the whole city is said to be included or only the part on the Balkan peninsula
Which part is the most important
As I think it's only fair to count that 60% as Balkan city
Depends on the definition, some definitions of the Balkans specifically exclude Greece
??????! Really
You don't think of Mainland Greece and Turkey as Balkan
I have never been there, so I was waiting for someone to confirm this
So thanks
If the most important part is in Thrace, then yes, in the global sense  Istanbul is the most important Balkan city
Not sure if it is the most important city for the Balkan countries though
I don't think of Greece and Turkey as Balkan either, I think of Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, and suchlike
In Dutch we speak of the Balkanschiereiland = the Balkan peninsula
This makes it impossible not to think of Greece and Turkey as Balkan
It wouldn't be a peninsula without them
Yeah, I know
That was just my question
Yes, apparently
I live in the historical center of a city which had it's height in the 15th century, so i'm surrounded by buildings ranging from back in the 1400's all the way up to brand new
Most of them were build between 1500 and 1900
My grandparents used to live on an old farm and my father found some Napoleonic coins in the garden when he was young
You'll probably find sth if you're lucky and search long and hard enough with a metal detector
If you'd visit Antwerp (after the Corona crisis), it'll be worth it to visit the underground parking site on the 'Leie' where a piece of the Spanish bastions/wall is visible
Now a project also integrated more of it in a park and car tunnel after being buried for over a 100 years
[The Spanish fortresses] were built by order of Charles V in 1542 - 1553, when Antwerp was the largest city in the Netherlands and was threatened by the northern rebellious provinces
Later, a citadel was built in the 16th century under the rule of Philps II and the Duke of Alva
In this pentagonal citadel the soldiers resided who had to keep the city under control in these barracks
Note that most of it has been demolished in 1895 to free the city for it's expansion
Nevertheless are the remaining bits very interesting

a friend of mine found a canadian ww2 gas mask in a field a while ago, most stuff older then that is pretty rare
Same in Belgium
In the area of the WW1 front, and in the rest of the country as well, unexploded artillery shells are found frequently
Many farmers have died after hitting an obus with their plough
I learned practically nothing about the EU in high school
I did learn about the different institutions and their functions in my last year of elementary school though (given that I was 11, this was obviously on a pretty basic level)
I'm in my mast year of my Master's in law and specialised in International and European law, so I do understand how it works now
We have what we call 'campus cards' that anyone who uses the train to go to school can get
It is one large card you have to get from your local train station once and then you attach a smaller card to it that allows you to take the train 5 times back and forth between your home and your school/university
Costs around €12 per small card
Only valid for trains unfortunatly and not for busses or trams
Some people also say 'een, twee, drie, spaghettiiii' here

Lmao how could I forget about that one
I don't think I really get offended by anything, but I do think it's quite annoying when people just think they can solve all our political problems two seconds after I met them
"Clearly you're country seems disfunctional
Why don't you guys just split up
One part to the Netherlands, one part to France
You're a fake country anyway
It's a bit more complicated than that mate
See nobody here is really patriotic about Belgium (except for when it's football, I dare you to laugh at Manneken Pis then), but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who wouldn't get annoyed if that's one of the first things you bring up
It's always those type of people who think they're an expert on the country because they watched some 10-minute YouTube video about it
I had a Romanian friend one who told me that a common question was if people would still support Ceaușescu .
I mean wtf who asks such questions
No, it's part of Denmark : p
Another thing people forget to do in France: when a shop employee or whatever greets you with "bonjour".... have the decency to answer with "bonjour"
People in France say "bonjour" much more easily than i Belgium, but it's important that you reply to them
Do people still do this
Asking any of that is the last thing that would go through my mind when talking to Germans
I want to clarify that OP doesn't take offense to these questions ( I think) But just says these are common questions
I don't think Belgians are easily irritated about such things ( bcs fries are fucking great )
"Omelette du fromage"
&#x200B;
Just no
to answer that question i never heard, yes there are people who regret those times
you could say they are supporters of him, i guess
It's not rude
I'd even say it's very nice to show enough interest to ask what region someone is from
We don't expect foreigners to know about Brussels being a small separate region
Or that there is a small German region as well
As different as standard American English and standard British English
No baguette fromaga
Dutchmen rarely use the word Vlaams
They call Flemish people "Belgen" and they call Flanders "België". But indeed, they sometimes use it when talking about Belgian Dutch, but I think they would just as often say "Nederlands" instead
And every person in Paris is carrying a baguette
So poor Sweden is hated by everyone :(
Well, who needs them anyway
Sweden has the nicest sounding language :p
Klapt vloams jong
For some obscure reason, they say 'Vlaamse friet
That's true
Oh yeah, that's right
But they also say "Franse friet". Is there a difference between Flemish and French fries
Maybe Flemish fries taste better
Aiai dan gon kik toch alles een vitess oger moete luistere

They also tell Flemish people their language is ugly right in their face

Well I don't know about the rest of Belgium but in my town they're gonna start using silent fireworks so animals won't get scared
I also just now learned about it but man I'm so glad it is a thing
This index scores 8 factors
* Under-5 mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births)
* Child stunting (% children aged 0-59 months)
* Out-of-school children of primary and secondary school age
* Children engaged in child labor
* Adolescents currently married or in union
* Adolescent birth rate
* Population forcibly displaced by conflict
* Child homicide rate
So in this index, poverty indicators are valued more than pure medical indicators (for which there are data available); other indicators aren't included because data about it wasn't available, like for sexual violence and trafficking
But Singapore just does very well on all these 8 indicators
On the same line with other countries in the top 10, but with significantly less teen mothers
Longest without a federal government, twice I believe now
Brussels is the most international city (most languages spoken) after Dubai
Belgium has the first Geocache on the Afro-Eurasian continent
Though that's probably very interesting if you aren't a Geocacher, haha
UNESCO declared our fries to be Cultural Heritage and our Beer Culture to be Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity
We are going for a new record this year
That's the weirdest church tower I've ever seen
It just looks like a big barn
Seems like fun hidden tourist spot though
We're bound to overtake that record quite soon
The new bicycle facility underneath Gent Sint-Pieters train station is set to have 17 000 bicycle spots
That is if the works ever get finished of course
Given the historical precedent, my money's on the German
I know how this is going to end, someone from "vlaams belang" or "ptb/pvda" wins and the other parties going to say "sorry no extremist didn't you hear about cordon sanitair" back to zero
There's An emergency government, and they figured out some limited Powers somehow
Plus, there's always the flemish and walloon governments and probably a few other government of equal power stuck between the couch cushions or something
From Half As Interesting
I... I... I don't think we need any more bombs from Germany
No more fries
Belgians would cry at this loss of our cultural heritage
If what vanished
Never heard of that
EDIT: just googled it, apparently, it's some sort of vegetable
No more fries
I think our whole nation would collectively die from heart attack
We'd just invent a syntheticly created potato
I ain't giving up my fries that easily
They can take our land, use it to settle their own gross battles, but NOT our fries
I've heard that pumpkin is a possible alternative, only problem is that I really don't like pumpkin
Mitraillette masterrace
Thank you for that glorious invention
I made good use of it during my studies
I love bread which is why I've never visited the US
I've heard stories of the bread wasteland that is the US
Didn't notice in Ireland
Was too drunk to notice I think
I mean over here people go super crazy and drunk about cycling and cyclocross, but luckily it hardly ever gets violent
Which has to be the most outrageous thing to have happened at a korfbal tournament
Ever
The fuck
What did they do to deserve that
A fucking korfbal tournament
Was it like, an accident, or did they actually get into a fight
Yeah, cycling is a surprisingly peacefull sport (for the fans) for how big it is here
No you're right
It's more about the individual cyclists and the countries they're from, not really about the team they're in
Belgium would be complaining about fries being Belgian and not French
We would all be complaining about the english guy being drunk and annoying again
We'd hesitate between all the options and finally end up choosing an incoherent mix of different dishes
We would hate the taste but wouldn't really complain too much because we asked for it
Belgium will sit on the prestige table with the other founding members of the EU and a glass of our best beer, while the kids (Eastern europe) are fighting over the food
Netherlands sat down at 17 and finished eating at 17:15
Dinner at 19 is late
18 is fine
Otherwise Belgium is happy but really indecisive
Those silly Wallonians
Welp, there he is
drunk off his arse and spouting some bullshit again
The disrespect
My blood is boiling, I'm shaking with fury and I just punched my pillow
Not only in the alps, the low countries (Belguim and The Netherlands) also eat at 18
Sorry I don't drink water, only beer
The Eighty Years' War
I had no idea the "south" (modern-day Belgium) was also involved in all of this until I read about it on Wikipedia
One of the most famous battles, the Battle of Nieuwpoort, was even set in Belgium and (apparently) is a well-known thing in the Netherlands
I guess they don't teach us that in school because it's something Dutch/"un-Belgian".
In high school we didn’t learn a lot about how and why we got independent from the Netherlands, and what country we formed before that (de Zuidelijke Nederlanden)
I’d have loved to learn about that in high school, luckily enough I had a history course in university and learned it there :)
How the Duchy of Burgundy had such an impact on modern Belgium and The Netherlands
How reading one book can open a lot of eyes
Nearly all of Belgian history
We have no history lesson about our own country
Also that Belgium was already independent in 1790 (I think), this only lasted for a year but still
The country was called 'the United Belgian States' although in Dutch it's translated to 'Verenigde Nederlandse Staten' (United Dutch States)
The country was unrecognised but it was a republic
It's teached in school nowadays though
We learned about this at school
Apart from that Ceasar said that Belgians were the bravest of all the Gallians
Sadly most teacher forget to say this was just a marketing stunt of him to brag that he defeated the bravest Gallians, even tho we were just some regular folks
Eh, that was not my case
I had to learn the whole monarchy history
I liked the part where leopold III was a pussy during WWII /s
Yes, de Bourgondiërs by Bart van Loo
He also has a podcast where he talks about it for 8 episodes
Really interesting (his main focus is Flanders of course)
yeah, it seems it really depends or the school or the teacher
The entire run might actually turn out as long as an average Belgian government formation
True, but so boring at the same time
Dubbing is the worst, I can't watch it
If I don't understand the language I'll just use subtitles
Dean is the Dutchman with the questionable fashion sense who just likes visiting
We didn't go into shutdown for 500 days
Shutdowns don't even exist here
It was a lame duck session of 500 days, not a shutdown
The previous goverment stayed in charge until the new government was sworn in
People hardly even noticed it
I remember when I was in Thailand, my school had some old reader's digest from 1993 that mentioned that the Czech couldn't agree on a name and had decided on Czech Republic as an interim name
Well, I mean, technically stuff like holocaust denial is banned right
So there are some opinions you can be fined for expressing (if not simply for having)
There's a thread about that on r/europe right now
Got all the usual suspects: r/T_D posters, brand new accounts, no-flair accounts, and American flag accounts
80%-90%? Looks like I'm moving north
To be fair, you have to admit the two favorite go-to smears Russian propaganda uses when someone criticizes the motherland are: “They’re fascists” or “They’re gay”.
I know
And we're not the only ones seeing that
I sometimes read about people who have been on reddit longer that r/europe used to be better
Is it just lackadaisical moderation that made it go to shit
Some of the threads over there, especially if you dare go into *new* once in a while, are downright scary
I hover over accounts sometimes and see that these posters are often very new (a few days/weeks) or are obviously American, but still, it's quite scary the amount of upvotes some comments straight up arguing for ethnic cleansing get
I can agree with that
There is a big difference between what Russian propaganda puts out, and whether people believe it
Especially young and traveled Russians will know it's all bullshit
But I distinctly remember during the Ukrainian revolt that Russian media first went with "they are degenerates and homosexuals", and when that didn't work (because how could homosexuals be so brave
) they went with: "Oh, they're all fascists, didn't you know
And some of those stories stick
I wonder how many Russians know the far right only got about 5% during the last Ukrainian elections

133 and further
I found a pirate copy here:
> In November and December 2013, the Russian media covering the Maidan introduced the irrelevant theme of gay sex at every turn
When covering the very first day of protests by Ukrainian students in favor of the association agreement, the Russian media sought to fascinate its readers by conflating Ukrainian politics with handsome men and gay sex
**A social media page of Vitali Klitschko, a heavyweight boxer who led a Ukrainian political party, was hacked and gay material introduced
Then this was presented as a news story for millions of Russians on a major television station, NTV
** Before Russians could apprehend that pro-European protests were underway in a neighboring country, they were invited to contemplate taboo sex
> Right after students began their protests on the Maidan, **the Russian television channel NTV warned of “homodictatorship” in Ukraine
** Viktor Shestakov, writing for Odna Rodina, claimed that **“a specter is haunting the Maidan, the specter of homosexuality
The fact that the first and the most zealous integrators in Ukraine are local sexual perverts has long been known
**”
> Dmitry Kiselev, the leading figure in Russian television media, warmed to the theme
[...] He is the director of a new media conglomerate known as Rossiia Segodnia, or Russia Today
[...]
> On December 1, 2013, the world press reported the beating of students by Ukrainian riot police the previous night
As Ukrainian students huddled in a church tending their wounds, Kiselev found a way to formulate their protests as sexual geopolitics
That evening on Vesti Nedeli, recalling to his viewers the Great Northern War of the early eighteenth century, he described the European Union as a new alliance turned against Russia
This time, however, **Kiselev claimed, the Swedish, Polish, and Lithuanian enemies were warriors of sexual perversion
** Poland and Lithuania were not in fact enemies of Russia in the Great Northern War
Getting one’s own history wrong is essential to eternity politics
> In another episode, **Kiselev expressed his delight to have discovered a magazine with a nude photo shoot of Klitschko from a decade earlier
** On the set, Kiselev stroked the black riot gear worn by the Ukrainian police as the camera zoomed in
Meanwhile, the **newspaper Segodnia breathlessly praised itself for publishing a photograph that framed Klitschko together with a gay Ukrainian writer
** In the Ukrainian context, these were two activists at a press conference
In the Russian press, the sexual orientation of the one and the male beauty of the other was the story
> European integration was interpreted by Russian politicians to mean the legalization of same-sex partnerships (which was not an element of Ukraine’s association agreement with the EU) and thus the spread of homosexuality
When the German foreign minister visited Kyiv on December 4, **the newspaper Komsomol’skaia Pravda headlined the meeting as “Gay firewood on the Maidan fire
**”
Continuing:
> The Night Wolves found concise ways to translate sexual anxiety into geopolitics and back again
As a male-only club devoted to black leather, the Night Wolves naturally had a strong position on homosexuality, which they defined as an attack by Europe and the United States
A year later, celebrating the Russian invasion, their supreme leader Alexander Zaldostanov remembered their proud parade around Crimea in this way: “For the first time we showed resistance to the global Satanism, the growing savagery of Western Europe, the rush to consumerism that denies all spirituality, the destruction of traditional values, **all this homosexual talk**, this American democracy
” According to Zaldostanov, **the slogan of the Russian war against Ukraine should be “death to faggots
”** The association of democracy with gay Satan was a way to make law and reform foreign and unthinkable
And if the gay scare doesn't work, just call your opponents nazi's:
> On March 16, some of the Ukrainian citizens of Crimea took part in an electoral farce that the Russian occupiers called a referendum
Prior to the vote, all public propaganda pushed in the same direction
**Posters proclaimed that the choice was between Russia and Nazism
Next page:
>  In the same spirit, **Alexander Prokhanov, speaking with Evelina Zakamskaia on Russian television on March 24, blamed Ukrainian Jews for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—and for the Holocaust
> This was a new variety of fascism, which could be called schizofascism: actual fascists calling their opponents “fascists,” **blaming the Holocaust on the Jews**, treating the Second World War as an argument for more violence
> Russians educated in the 1970s, including the leaders and war propagandists of the 2010s, were instructed that “fascist” meant “anti-Russian
” In the Russian language it is practically a grammatical error to imagine that a Russian could be a fascist
In contemporary Russian discourse, it is easier for an actual Russian fascist to call a non-fascist a “fascist” than it is for a non-fascist to call a Russian fascist a “fascist
” Thus a fascist like Dugin could celebrate the victory of fascism in fascist language while condemning as “fascist” his opponents
> **Ukrainians defending their country were “junta mercenaries from the ranks of the Ukrainian swine-fascists
**” Similarly, a fascist like Prokhanov could describe fascism as a physical substance that spilled in from the West to threaten Russian virginity
In June, **Prokhanov wrote of fascism as “black sperm” that threatened “the golden goddesses of Eurasia
**” His lapidary expression of racial and sexual anxiety was a perfect fascist text
Glazyev also followed the schizofascist protocol
While endorsing Nazi geopolitics, he set a standard for calling Russia’s enemies “fascist
” Writing in September 2014 for the Izborsk Club, **Glazyev called Ukraine “a fascist state, with all the signs of fascism known to science
”**
It goes on and on
So maybe the Russians don't believe anything of this, as you claim
Might be, I don't know
Still, the pattern of the rhetoric is clear: the enemies of Russia are either gay or fascists
[Bart De Pauw] used to be one of the most popular TV personalities over here, but in 2017 it was revealed that he had been harassing female colleagues for years
His contract was immediately terminated, and you don’t really hear from him anymore, except for his trial which is supposed to start in a few weeks if I’m not mistaken
That, and then some other male celebs made headlines a few months back because their nudes got leaked after they sent them to someone who claimed to be a woman but turned out to be just some dude
It was really big news for two or three weeks and then it just blew over, so it’s really not *that* interesting tbh
You forgot my way by frank sinatra somehow being used as a funeral song
like wth
Do people even losten to it
Not the American way but 10 days or 2 weeks of boy-scouts camp is fairly usual
Same here I think
It used to be every 6 months but because everything is always fine I go every 9 months now
I used to go every 1-2 year but now I realise I haven't been to one in like 2
5 years
But everything is always fine
If it starts hurting I'll go again
In Belgium, there's a system where you get paid back more when you visit the dentist regularly than when you don't visit often
The standard is twice a year
Also, it gets more expensive if you don't go once a year
Mutuality/ziekenfonds doesn't pay back as much of the cost in that case
Yup, that's why I go once every year
Dentist also sends out a reminder so I won't forget to make an appointment
Belgium is a small and (often) insignificant country, so I don't expect anyone to know its history
If I had to point one thing however, it is the little known fact that Belgium was actually an industrial powerhouse in the 19th century
The first country to industrialize on the continent, the second in the world after the UK
The per capita GDP (PPP) was continuously in the European top 3 from 1830 to WWI
That Flemish cities as Bruges and Ghent (even Ypres and maybe Antwerp) in the period between the 13-15th were seen as the richest/most powerful cities north of The Alps
> I met quite a few people who didn't know the emperor/kaiser was elected
Maybe is it because the election lost its importance during the few centuries of continuous Habsburg rule
We aren't even thaught about Congo lol
Well it's just mentioned and my teacher said some bad stuff we did, it isn't even part of the curriculum
Yeah, I figured that people would learn about that
This is why I didn't mention it, because it doesn't meet the requirement of the question: "surprised to learn was **not** taught in other countries
Yeah but it's not like the king chopped off all those hands
>Your king was kind of a sick psychopath tho
Nooooooooooo, what do you mean with that
He didn't do *anything* wrong
Officially the death penalty was abolished only in the 1990s, but we barely used it
The last executions were performed on Nazi collaborators in 1950
There also was one execution in 1916 (we borrowed a guillotine from France, because didn't have any of or own anymore)
The last execution in peace time was in the 1860s.
Well, the expats in Brussels all seem to live within their own bubble
Which makes me think we must not be the friendliest
We are friednly and neutral towards anyone
But don't expect to make a Belgian friend, that is equally hard for a middle easterner than it is for a German
Is Belgium seen as former Spanish territory, since we were part of your empire from 1549 to 1715
Depends on the employer for us
in my case I recover it as a bank holiday that I can use whenever I want until 2022
It just gets added to the pile of vacantion days I can take
Officially no
It's a workday
But in practice employers will offer an extra vacation day as compensation
Mine give it back to us the 14th of May (So 4 day WE)
Mine gives it between Christmas and New year, we always have a week off between those two
i shower 2-3x a week when the temperature is cold/moderate
when it's hot i shower every day
I do; we have a pizza cutter/wheel, but scissors just work better and faster
Amazing, you might have admitted to blasphemy greater than fruit pizza
I use scissors and everyone here looks at me like I'm crazy too
Burn the witches
Flavius Claudius Julianus, labelled/called "Julian the Apostate" by Christians
Because he simply tried to save the Empire from the cultural and spiritual destruction brought by Christianity
Christians were basically killing, torturing, force-converting all non-Christians; they were destroying ancient temples, burning literature, doing everything they could to destroy European historical and cultural religions, in order to have only one religion, one way to think, one way to live
They destroyed our cultures, philosophies and spiritualities
Had Julian lived and his successors continued in his path, European cultures and religions would probably still exist, without the destructive monopoly of Christianity
Unlike some previous emperors, he didn't violently persecute Christians, he simply tried to reduce their influence and take-over over everything
With him, maybe Pagans and Christians would have coexisted, there would still be alive continuous European religions, instead of only Christianity and a church killing, persecuting or force-converting all non-Christians for centuries
1) Hadrian (all the obvious reasons)
2) Didius Julianus, because my man straight bought his way to the throne
Didn't end well, but still
I live in Antwerp,  which means that I look down on the rest of the country
I think we also mostly laugh with the 'slow' Limburgers and West Flemish who can't pronounce "muggengeheugen".
''Muhhehheheuhen''
MA HOW SEH
We don't want you on our roads
I don't know if you noticed but Flanders has actually started investing a lot in roads
Just look at [what they plan on doing in 2021]
Stomme kut
Met vriendelijke groet
WEST-VLAANDEREN
In the western flemish dialect the letter G is pronounced like an H, so the word muggenegeheugen (mosquito brains) becomes  something like  Muhhehheheuhen
I would think the cinema industry are concentrated in near Canne
Brussels,  Antwerp and Gent
Antwerp is the city,  everything else is parking space :)
By municipality: Antwerp, Ghent and Charleroi
By agglomeration: Brussels, Antwerp and Liège
Though everybody seems to go by municipalities except for Brussels
Going by municipalities in Brussels is ridiculous
You might as well go by Antwerp's districts
Just like when talking about London, we talk about Greater London, not London City
Same with Paris and its separate 'arrondissements'.
It's Brussels, do you even know how big Brussels is
But you're right about the municipalities
The vaccination against polio is mandatory here
I’d fully support mandatory vaccinations for the ones on our basic vaccination chart (vaccinations for deadly diseases) since *only* 93% is vaccinated with those, which honestly doesn’t seem like a lot to me
Usually yes, but not for all of them
Kinda means the same no
Quite similar to the German Wilhelm
I visited Bulgaria and I was pleasantly surprised
The cities are really beautiful and really green as well
And the Bulgarian landscape can be breathtaking
Flemish people like to talk shit about Wallonia, but there are some amazing cities and small towns and the Ardennes are the only real nature we have here
We have Last Friday Lunch where I work
Every last friday of the month we have lunch together with all the departments/companies in the building on the company dime
This is about 70 people and each department/company takes their turn organizing it
Lunch can be a local caterer who comes on site, pizza delivery, a food truck, etc
It's also totally normal to drink a few beers and/or have some wine with your lunch
It's a nice break we all look forward to and a moment you can relax and talk with your colleagues and management
We haven't had a LFL in over a year because of Covid and I really miss it now that I think about it
hopping here to say that for example in Romania you're the one who has to host(aka pay) dinner for your guests while in Belgium, where i live now, it's expected for your guests to cover the bill
Or buy you a cake or viennoiseries
My boyfriend recommends Noordkaap (for example "Arme Joe") as band that sings in Flemish
He knows a lot of good Belgian rock/metal bands but they all have English lyrics
CPeX
Clement Peerens Explosition
He sings in Aantwaarps, a universal language
Metal I would say the only one that sings Dutch/Flemish consistently is called Fleddy Melculy
Amenra has a song which is called "Terziele
Tottedood
" which has lyrics in Dutch/Flemish
If you go to just general rock music, there's some things like Gorki and Noordkaap
But my guilty pleasure would be De Kreuners then
Their biggest hit is called "Ik wil je" (I want you) and is a staple at drunk parties
Except de boeren don't understand it
Leopold II
Yep, came here for this, but also an honorable mention for this title: Yves Leterme, for thinking we were France smh
He made Belgium great, don’t get where the insanity would come from
Stalin the second
Chad the mad lad
He didn't rule the Congo, he *owned* it
It is the first and only private colony ever
What he did in Congo was nothing short of atrocities
And you have to be a special kind of evil or fucked in the head to commit such atrocities
Technically not since ethnic cleansing was not the intent or cause of death (less than 5% of the deaths in Leo's Congo were violent deaths afaik)
But merciless exploitation on a scale that rivals the largest genocides
Absolutely
Some could argue that it's even worse
Mate, a genocide doesn't stop being one because it was only partial
The essence is that people were lined up in the desert to die because they were Armenian
Let's not deny history because of nationalistic pride and let's call a spade a spade
As you see the Kingdom of Belgium has done even worse, yet almost nobody here denies the nature or the scale of the atrocities committed in the Congo
Because what the Ottomans have done *fits* the definition of genocide
The guy who coined the word even had that particular event in mind among others
"Genocide" isn't some sort of rank on the Scale of Badness
It describes how things went down and the intentions that were behind it
What Belgium did is in many ways worse, but it doesn't fit the definition
So what hypocrisy
Marc Dutroux, he kidnapped 6 girls and put them in a basement and sexually abused them
(he kidnapped 2 girls, three times)
He killed 2 girls, 2 starved to death and the 2 others were found
Another famous case is the one of Andras Pandy
He was Hungarian but lived in Belgium
He killed 6 of his family members
Don't forget the Cassis de Dijon case, ECJ
Especially the argument that a higher alcohol % is beneficial for your health
10/10 for trying lol
Also, the Dutroux case induced the police reform
And Andres Pandy made his family members disappear in destop
Actually his wive let the 2 starve to death
He was in jail (for something else than the kidnappings) and he asked her to feed the kids
She went to the house to feed the dog but not the kids
She's a monster too
She's already released from prison
Welcome in Belgium
Not a single person in the Benelux seems to know what is the utility of the Benelux
You know alot but I'm gonna  smooth some edges, if you don't mind
>I know that Belgium has administrative division, based on ethnicity
It is language based, ethnicity isn't really part of it
North Belgium (Flanders) is majority and officially Dutch (Flemish), Walloon (South) is French speaking (historically Walloon)
Brussels is an enclave in Flanders and has it's own government, just like Flanders and the Walloon each have one
On top of that each language communty (German, Dutch and French) has their own seperate government (But in the case of Flander and the Dutch speaking community those are one and the same) and we have a federal government which gives us a total of 6 governments and parliaments
>Belgium has 4 (?) official languages
3: Dutch, French and German in order of most spoken (only arround 3% speaks German as a mothertongue iirc)
>Netherlands and Luxembourg have three (?)
The Netherlands has 1 language that is official in all provinces, and that is Dutch, but in Friesland Friesian is an official language too
On some colonial Islands they have English and Papiamento as sort-off official languages too
Luxembourg is correct (Luxembourish, French and German)
I feel Liège probably isn't the best city for visiting pretty architecture, or classy people, although I've only heard from others
(Aside from Namur I've only been to wallonia in passing)
edit: I forgot I go to the Ardennes a lot (they're really nice if you want to stay for a while with a group in a cozy house and do hikes
It is a pretty big central city but possibly a bit far from the ports for it to be as effective as other options
That's not really locals though but people travelling through because it's notoriously cheap there
We prefer not to think about it too much
It sounds so European to accidentally drive through another country
Our women are made of sand too
Only the Dutch can be difficult when it comes to financial matters
I've no idea when Belgium or Luxembourg ever made a lot of a fuss
> Brussels is an enclave in Flanders
Historically, Brabant isn't Flanders though
Brussels is what remains of a genuine Brabant
Before the 90's, both Brabants weren't considered either Flemish nor Walloon, and before the "Flemish movement', Limburg and the province of Antwerpen weren't considered Flemish either
Limburg was its own cultural thing, Antwerpen was a part of Brabant
And Brabant has a distinct history from Flanders
It's the perfect example of anarchy
I hate sand, it coarse and rough
And it gets everywhere
Walloon,  and [many others]
Yeah, but in terms of "officially" we mean the administrative languages etc
Otherwise West-Flemish, Walloon, Picard, etc
would count aswell
I went on a trip in Dutch Limburg a while ago
I didn't know the language existed, so when I heard someone speak it, I was confused af
At first I thought it was a dialect of German, but the more I heard, the less German-like it became
I legit thought they were speaking some made-up language with a bit of Dutch and German in there
That's probably how non-benelux people feel when they hear someone speak Dutch or Luxembourgish
Yup, correct
But I hope you see that I was talking about the current day region of Flanders, which surrounds the region of Brussels, instead of the different midieval county of Flanders
that's fun, I'd definitely recommend Bruges and Ghent, I really liked visiting Bruges and occasionally go to Ghent during the Gentse feestdagen, it's a really nice atmosphere
If you like churches then you'd easily find Them in Maline aswell (though as a person who's lived there all her life I may be considered biased)
I'm from Liège, the city is not great but it's fine I guess
They're far away from everything not Luxembourg tbh
Are the cargo ports connected to the port via railway, waterway or road
Because if it's road that's just dreadful
Otherwise I'd be strongly in favour
Don't worry, at least 3/4 of the Belgians also don't understand all the governments, and even just the structure and functioning (as if
) of the overarching federal government seems to be lost to many
The institutions here are just really strong which is why the country just keeps functioning even after a year and a half without a government
I just mean in general but that specific deal is probably what it's all about yeah
And you're right that they have the right to be sceptical
Something like this is giving and taking, compromising
Limburg and West-Flemish
Walloon, Picard and many more
[West-Flemish get subtitled by our own goverment
Yes, but that's not what an official language is
That's a recognized language, both Walloon and Picard are examples of that in Wallonia
I'd say Antwerp is a bit of a mix between the old and the new, it's nice just a bit more modernized, I'm sure there's some nice places though and I've visited a few art shows there that were really nice, definitely recommend looking up some of those
Baarle-Hertog/ Baarle-Nassau is a very interesting place and pretty good looking as well but keep in mind that it's just a medium sized village with lots of farmland around it and not some kind of tourist hub
I live in Belgium right on the border with it
Still interesting to see it with your own eyes though
I knew it was that video as soo as I read your comment ;)
Antwerp is really nice to visit as well yeah
Maybe more variation then Brugge or Gent but with possibly a somwhat smaller historical centre in comparison
In Dutch (Belgium ):
- **singular**: dankuwel
- **plural**: dank jullie wel
Don't forget "dikke ciaoukes"!
In our area it is only used when starting to drink a beer
Wouldn't people in the Netherlands also prefer "dankjewel" for singular
There are honestly so many ways to thank people
and the totally Dutch word 'Mercikes'
There are like hundreds of ways to say thank you
I had to narrow it down
Maybe because you live in Switzerland
But we mostly use 'danku(wel)' for singular and plural
That's the shortened version
Kind of like "thank you" and "thanks" but without much of the casual connotation
Dankuwel is more of a Flemish thing
People don't like to use 'je' here
It sounds unnatural, to me at least
It doesn't mean good in Dutch
It most commonly is used as the negation of a negation, I don't think English has such a word
- "Why didn't you do it
- "I _did_ do it
Becomes:
- "Waarom heb je dat niet gedaan
- "Ik heb dat _wel_ gedaan
However, several centuries ago it did have the meaning of being well, in the sense of well-being, being happy and healthy
That meaning isn't used today except in this fixed expression
We use 'u(w)' instead of 'jou(w)', 'je' would be 'ge'. 'U' is still formal if it's used as the subject of the sentence
I mean in een unformal context
Dutch is pretty much halfway between German and English
Yeah I didn't mean to be exhaustive in my answer
That said, "hij heeft er wel tien gevangen" and especially "wil je wel eens nadenken" sound like they come from the Netherlands
You wouldn't hear "wel" being used in those ways here
"Hij heeft het wel geprobeerd" _feels_ like it's the same meaning as the double negation, but I can't describe it well
Translating it to English, it becomes the same stressed verb
"He _did_ try it
Le petit prince
Its a French book that Flemish students are supposed to read for French class
We didn't have one book we all had to read, we were given a list of books written (mostly) by Dutch and Dutch-speaking Belgian authors, of which we could freely pick for books report and the likes
AFAIK, no world literature, which is a bit of a shame if you ask me
I'm frankly under the impression that it's whatever the hell your teacher likes to be honest
Education in belgium is very liberal and divided, we have directions issued by the gouvernement(s), but those are minimumgoals it’s up to the teachers and schools to add their own touch
Also the communities (flemish, walloon and german) have their own minimumgoals and stuff, thatns why walloons aren’t forced to take dutch classes, but Flemmings are forced to take french classes
Anyone can start a school here, everyone can choose what school they want to attend and follows their values
It’s just that your degree will only be accepted and will only receive subsidies if you accomplish the minimumgoals
The freedom to choose your school, and start a school are constitutional rights
Who now cause a little uproar after the Flemish gouvernement made new, very specific minimumgoals for our schools
To make it short, there is no list of books we have to read
The teacher or school decides or just lets us choose
Also, les miserables
Is it easy for a modern Greek speaker to understand ancient/classical Greek
IIRC correctly we are one of the few countries hammering so hard on grammatics and way less on literature
I have never read anything from Shakespeare, Don quichot or whatever
Wherever literature we read is on the teachers discretion
I had to read les miserables, one part each trimester
But for some reason we never got around to reading the third part
So I've read 2/3 of les miserables, which is somehow worse than reading the full thing
Never read that one and only graduated 4,5 years ago
Actually, we didn't have to read any classics at all
Oh that's cool
I didn't know that Homer was that far off from classical Greek
I've read excerpts of both language variations in the original language and I didn't really see that big of a difference, but I guess that's just because I've never learnt modern Greek
Stuff I can't live without is a lot different from stuff I can't travel without
There is only one thing I really need and that's my \*\*\*\* crossword puzzle --no-block, no-bar style--, a pencil, an eraser
So outside the usual suspects (roof, electricity, water, stove, pantry
Live :
* my 30cm razor sharp chef's knife : how on earth can I cook anything if I can't do some cutting first
Travel (basic stuff being passport, credit card, water bottle, smartphone, sunglasses)
* nothing really
There are quite some Germanisms I regularly use
Autobaan - Bermerking - Technieker - omkleden
I love the word überhaupt (and sowieso)
Fingerspitzgefuhl is one of my favorite germanisms
>For example, for some reason, instead of jogging we say "footing".
We say that too in French !
Not that uncommon, but also not 'in fashion' atm
I thinks it's mostly grandparents that have issues with it, and occasionally a judgmental employer (but they would be legally in the wrong)
I have long hair, it's quite uncommon and somewhat frowned upon in professional circles
I've been told I can't have long hair in a professional sales role for example (like account manager or something)
It is not very common
You see it from time to time, but in many cases, it is associated with being fan of metal
I don't pay attention to other peoples hair honestly
5% maybe
Nobody gives a shit
Go see your union, they shouldn't say that to you (I know, easier said than done depending on your contract, but you have rights here)
Eh, it was at a first job, I was doing a junior role at a bank, trying to figure out what career I wanted to pursue, and asked my manager in confidence whether she thought I could promote to account manager in a year or two
I much preferred her honesty there, it made it clear to me that I don't want a job where I always need to have 'the right look'.
Honestly, I prefer a clear explanation
Otherwise I would just vaguely get denied a promotion for 'not being a good fit'.
It's actually an interesting point: what if there's something about you (not just talking hair, but say race or sexuality) which an employer finds problematic (cause they're a racist or whatever)
They obviously can't tell you outright, but they can still deny you the job on some vague grounds
Wouldn't you rather know what the reason is
Disclaimer: I don't mean to claim that being discriminated on my hair is the same as racism or something
As a queer, disabled person I understood and get it, that's why I'm so into 'you have rights' (we usually know btw, just can't really proof it)
I can imagine you get it then
When do you encounter discrimination on those things
I always read stuff about racism, but I'm hardly aware of other kinds of discrimination
Mante Religieuse (religious mantis, probably because she looks like she's praying)
Haan is also a type of beetle
Almost
That would be Springhaan
I wouldn't mind that either
The lazyhorse isn't the same as your other examples though
Luipaard comes from the same root as leopard, and has nothing to do with an actual horse
On the other hand zeehond, nijlpaard and zeepaard come from zee-hond (sea-dog), nijl-paard (Nile-horse) and zee-paard (sea-horse)
How can you even put your country beside your name
You're welcome under our boot
Olé Olé Olé
Les Lacs du Connemara is also quite famous though
You have Stromae and Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike to refer to but this is what first comes to your mind
We for sure have a lot of international artists
If I have to choose one to compare to the national anthem, then Lange JoJo is the one that comes to mind ye
Saying we are a part of France and Netherlands put together, or French people and Dutch people put together
I won't speak for the Flemings, but for Walloons, saying we are French or a part of France is particularly insulting because :
* It is ***historically totally inaccurate***. We speak a Romance language because of the Roman Republic and Empire, not because of France
We have been part of France for only 20 years, under Napoléon
All the remaining time, we have been counties and duchies within the Holy Roman Empire, from it creation up to the end of 14th century, then under Burgundy, then Hapsburg empire/monarchs, Spanish then Austrian
Liège has been its own "independent" entity the whole time until 1795, always as part of the HRE alone
Wallonia and Brabant have more common history with Germany and the Netherlands than it ever had with France
* It is ***culturally incorrect*** : Walloons may speak French today, but it is fairly recent ; our historical and cultural language is Walloon
Most people born before WW2 still spoke Walloon at home, French being for public life
Walloons were forced to speak French by the bourgeois/rich and aristocratic elite from Brussels, Flanders and the rich parts of Wallonia
They tried to do the same in Flanders, but failed
Had they been as successful as they had been in Wallonia, Flemings would speak French today too, would they be seen as French people too then
So, speaking French doesn't make us French
We have a different culture from the Frenchies; a different history, a different way to do things
We might share a lot with them today, but it's mostly due to medias and collaborations in arts
That they don't like our fries
Hey as far as i'm concerned Portuguese is so much cooler to hear than spanish
One sounds like happy drunk people, the other like the military
i played the board game of "the slimste mens" and she thought that kopenhagen was in the netherlands
as a flaming/fleming/flamand whatever I also hate it and i hate everybody who wantes to split our country to join those respective countries
i'm not dutch and i rather be walloon french or german before i become dutch
One way to avoid that would be to become religiously Iranian back : get rid of the Arab religion that is Islam, which terrorize your country with its religious dictatorship, and revive Zoroastrianism as your main religion
Why worship a foreign god from a foreign religion that was forced down upon you by Arab invasions
> That we are East Europe
In many European countries, there is no concept of Central Europe, so you are either Western, Northern, Eastern or Southern (Edit : "you are" : for people of said countries that is
And there is no offense or insult meant by that)
so you have beef with 100+ countries recognizing it's independence good luck
Kosovo je Srbija !
And beers !
did the austrian empire even have grounds outside of europe
I would think that would be a catalyst for saying something like that
said with respect as belgium was once part of austrian empire
Well, we have the population of a big metropolis, and we 98% of our people live in cities
So, in a way, we could be seen as a very extended city
If it weren't said by Trump, it could have been a good joke about the country
our tradition our decision
it's a tradition in the netherlands and belgium
you have the origins of santa, saint nicolas and he brings gifts to all children that were good that year and  black petes are his army of black face side kicks "helpers"
but it's a seperate day 6 december unlike santaon christmass
the current explanation for the black face is that black pete comes in through the chimney but that does not look like it since we use full black paint , pete has curly black hair and red lips
"roet veeg piet" soot wipe pete serves to make a black pete more like the lore would suggest and makes a pete with black smeres on his face
Its probably cause it is pronounced the same way and then my brain doesn't kick in and stays on automatic
Sorry dude I don't hate you I just hate to be you
"poepen "! ="kakken"
"aardappel" =="patat"
my apologies the translation of the list wasn't as well updated as the english version
I don't think Americans who didn't vote for Trump should apologise
Those who voted for Trump, that's another story
How did your country punished/behaved towards collaborators who worked with Nazi Germany
Saw recently a Flemish tv program where they interviewed kids from collaborators during the Nazi regime in Belgium that explained how their life was after the war
And I was wondering how other countries handled collaborators
I will only talk about Wallonnia because Flanders didn't do nearly the same thing
Most were sent to prison and/or had death penalty
For the one who were not judged(in smaller village) there were a wave of murder which is commonly known as the "Secret des tombes" as most resistant knew who murdered them but they kept the secret till they all died
Leon Degrelle lived like a king in Spain
Uganda
Is this random or was there a specific relation between Malta and Uganda
Russian officials doing things mainly for political reasons
NO WAY
But what hair
I remember mitterand the genius, he collaborated with nazis and resistants just to win in every case
Yeah but in Wallonia it was mostly like in Luxembourg and in France where Colabo were murdered and their investigation were closed without any answer
In Flanders we had a lot of people fighting with the Nazi regime because they believed this would help Flanders getting independent
Most of them didn't even agree with the Nazis
So you could make the point: why execute if they even didn't agree with them
But I get where you're coming from
True, I understand your point
A ton
Basically every time I go on vacation I visit at least one castle, often more than one
I've visited castles in Belgium, Luxembourg, England, Scotland, France, Germany, Spain and maybe Austria, Croatia, Italy and the Netherlands too as a kid
I know I've been there but can't remember if I visited a castle or not
Each holiday like two or something
We mostly go to France so yeah
Hard to say
I would estimate that over the years I've been to about 10-20 castles depending on if you count fortresses as well
Visited as in stepped into and all that
5 or so I think
The one in Ghent city center with school, visited some in France on holiday, etc
Seen
Way to many
Private insurance additional to the state one
Car + fuel card
Phone subscription
Financial bonuses twice a year
Meal cheques
Pretty much any training we want
13th month of salary + holiday money
We don't have any buses around at midnight, but yeah, drunks randomly singing is to be expected c:
At least they had taste, singing Queen
(French language) thick Québécois and various African accents can be very difficult to understand yes, but when it comes to Africa, it really depend the country as well
My girlfriend, who is from Cameroon, actually adapts her accent when speaking to non-Cameroonese people
Afrikaans isn't really the same as Dutch, but still
and I find it pretty hard to understand
I can't have a conversation in Afrikaans
But in the same way, I can't have a conversation with somebody from here who's speaking a completely different dialect than mine, so it's not that weird
Congolese people speaking french isn't really a problem
It's rather easier than harder
I don't speak Spanish or Portugese so that doesn't matter
When it comes to French, Africans tend to speak more sophisticated actually, ([Eddy Malou] the best of course)
South-African is not easy to understand as a European Dutch-speaker
I've never spoken to someone from Suriname so I can't say anythikg about that
Just checked, and it appears "Cameroonian" is the correct form
Well, my bad
In French, my mother tongue, it is : "camerounais". The equivalent of the "-ais" ending in English is : "-ese", and I assumed that word frollowed the same logic in English, since we don't say "camerounien" in French ("-ien" ending in French is the equivalent of English "-ian")
But was wrong, ah
it's not the accent that's sophisticated, it's the level of language : vocabulary, grammar, etc
Do you differentiate between different phases
For example 1789 is the start, but the execution of the the King didn't happen until 1793
And Napoleon didn't really come to power untill 1799
While the rest of Europe colonised the world, Germany tried to conquor Europe
And the "world" made Germany feel very bad about it
Meanwhile Congo, Vietnam, Philippines, Algeria, Tunisia, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, North America, South Africa, other African countries, India and others go brrrrrrrr
Moules-frites
I hate the mussels part, not the fries part
Vol-au-vent, super overrated
Also, Gentse Waterzooi, how do people like that
The few things I don't like aren't that popular here (Fennel, coriander and Americans call Brussel's sprours), and I guess like all Belgian diishes
fries with mayonaise, ketchup is just that much better
Go back to the shadows you came from
In my (Belgian) opinion, Dutch food is extremely "basic", but it's almost always fine
British food on the other hand is usually not fine
I tend to leave British restaurants with regret
Also, stroopwafels and kruidnoten are fantastic
Same, and I personally dislike almost every European rice dish
Imo stoofvlees (carbonade flamand) is a better national dish
Mussels are eaten just as much in the Netherlands
I didn't even know it was considered our national dish untill a few years ago lol
I don't like spaghetti or any pasta either so you shouldn't care about my opinion about food lol
Risotto is indeed one of the exceptions yes
I sadly can't help you with that
I can't cook
Maybe you can ask on r/belgium
German people are also more direct at least compared to Belgians
TIL I'm German
Wait, is that weird
We do as well
How else do you make "the circle" when you arrive or leave
Roet Piet for life
Do we
I’m belgian too and I’ve never really done that
Google maps doesn't show me small pathways or walking routes that are shorter though
Like, I know shortcuts through Leuven that won't show on Maps
Change it to Roet Piet and I agree
There's no sensible reason to use black face
Ugh no thanks
And this is why Belgium is a seperate country
Brabant and Limburg need to be reunited again for this purpose
The Africa museum in Tervuren just outside of Brussels
The musical instrument museum just for the wonderfull building
The Mundaneum in Mons about a first attempt at a world wide knowledge database
Flanders Fields in Ypres the reference museum for world war 1
And the battle of the bulge museum in Bastogne
I'm a big fan of the Kröller Möller museum
And ofcourse u/arthistorybrussels !
Museum of Natural Sciences is also a great recommendation
If only for the dinosaur exhibit
Almost non existing as they only started over here last year
We have 6 KFC's, 7th one coming to Antwerp in December
To make a comparison, numbers from 2018, McDonalds has 80 restaurants under the management of 24 franchisees and nearly 4,500 employees
Also, we have an original European chain of hamburger restaurants called Quick
It originated in Belgium but I think it's French now
Until they were bought by Burger King that is
A lot of them were changed to Burger Kings in Belgium, but before that, I guess there were 450+ of them in France, Belgium and Luxembourg
We only got our first KFC a couple years ago iirc
I always went to eat in a KFC when I was in another country
According to their own website, first one in Belgium opened in 2019
Oh yeah sorry I didn't see your first sentence for some reason
Crazy that there are already 6 KFCs in less than 2 years
I think in most Western countries it's a fundamental skill
Otherwise you would have to buy prepared food every day which is a lot more expensive and unhealthy and requires you to give up other things
You can do without if you have to money for it is what I'm trying to say
If you don't know at least 5 different dishes by heart and aren't able cook using basic instructions in a cookbook, people assume you're hopeless
UK feels very close even tho it’s a (small) channel away
The UK
Probably the neighbour I like the most
the UK, because they helped getting us independent and there's just a little sea between us
We were one country once
But then Belgium’s teenage years came and then it all fell apart
Belgium was part of Austria for 94 years, before the conquests of Napoléon
The Belgian revolution wasn't just throwing a fit
For example, we basically had no representation in governance in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands
Every time our representatives didn't vote the way the North did, they'd just not count our votes
On top of that, even though Belgium had more people than the Netherlands, we didn't receive a proportional amount of representatives
In fact, we received less than the North
Then there was a whole other hoist of issues like the lack of freedom of the press or freedom of education
In fact, relations between Belgium and the Netherlands were so soar that shortly after we gained independence we planned on invading the Netherlands
History would've turned out way differently if France didn't stop that
It's only since after the world wars that relations between Belgium and the Netherlands turned for the better
For half our history we were sworn enemies
These days people have forgotten why there was a revolution in the first place
Really
Hey it is just a joke
I know that in the beginning it was bad between us but pls
France would not have helped us actually, they didn't want us to attack at all, which is why we didn't.
No one mentions Portugal :(
Invade Netherlands, make it forfeit its colonies to Belgium, potentially liberate territories hostile to the Dutch Royal family
Even though the Royal family was extremely popular amongst some of the population, a large minority in the Netherlands was  hostile for the same reason Belgium revolted
Additionally, Belgium had a large espionage mission in the Netherlands, exposing the Dutch military functioning and plans to the Belgian enemy
On top of that the Netherlands barely had an army to begin with compared to Belgium
Prussia would not join the war if France did not join the war
The UK couldn't join the war as it was preoccupied with other wars
Eventually the plan was cancelled because the French advised strongly against it
The exact plan has been destroyed, and so have the communications between France and Belgium about the potential invasion
The UK was caught up in its own wars, unable to do much
Prussia agreed to not intervene if France didn't. What exactly the communication was between France and Belgium is unknown as the records were destroyed, but we know that France was not supportive of a Belgian invasion of the Netherlands resulting in a Belgian colonial empire
We're also talking about a period where Belgium was one of the richest countries on the planet
Not per capita, but in absolute numbers
The Dutch navy was bigger I believe, but would've also been ineffective at defending the Netherlands
Belgium got its hands on all Dutch military plans and exactly how it planned to defend, so it knew to avoid fighting in certain locations
The idea was to get to the big cities like Amsterdam in one sweep and have the Dutch government resign the war
The Dutch military was mostly effective abroad
We don't in Belgium but I remember watching some of your national ads for it in my Spanish classes and it was great (mostly the one with the old janitor
Italy: going out in Bologna (left lively student city), the lakes and mountains in the North, fresh amazing pizzas for 2 euros, buying weird illegal maffia cigarettes in Napoli and realizing they're super unhealthy so trying to sell them again in shitty Italian, oh and a super cool free festival on the beach in Ravenna (Beaches Brew)
Slovenia: Calamares, lake Bohinj, taking cheap trains in the beaaautiful nature, meeting some awkward but super chill and nice guys who gave us a joint
Croatia: spending all day swimming in the sea, beautiful sunsets, naked midnight swims
Germany: Drinking tons of beer and smoking inside (!!!) of the bars, the cool artistic vibe in Berlin
Scotland: the constant feeling of being in the Harry Potter movies (Glenfinnan is where the viaduct is which they used for the train scenes
), the sincerety and accent of the people
Spain: Bars with huge plates of tapas, sleeping outside in the mountains near Madrid (they are beautiful and super reachable with a cheap bus), hearing everyone curse constantly I (have the feeling people there curse a lot), the Moroccan vibe in Granada
Portugal: Getting lost in all the small streets in Lisbon, sleeping in a big house (airbnb) in Sintra with a lot of friends and having the feeling that it was haunted (some low key creepy shit happened, was funny), being there when they won the Euro cup in 2016
Norway: Being in the north in the summer, so it never went dark (or like maybe for 1 hour), so I went out for a midnight walk and it was really cool, I felt like I was the only person in the world, it was super misty around the mountains
Bosnia: Eating suuuper cheap (like 2 euros for a full plate in a restaurant), being in shisha bars
Hungary: Walking on a hill with a cool view in Budapest and drinking beers there, listening to music, going out in a club with a cool courtyard and talking to a lot of people there, the cheap delicious gnocchi I ate (I still think about it a lot)
Montenegro: Visiting a free cat museum, I was in a bad mood that day but that made me smile at least
(Okay now that I sum this up I realize more how much I like cheap food haha)
I don't travel enough to have a favorite memory, they are all good :)
I have been to: France, Germany, Denmark, Luxembourg and Austria
I also passed trough the Netherlands with a night-buss (way back from Denmark) :S. You guys have good roads the moment we passed the Belgian border we all woke up to chant "We zijn er bijna" (We are almost there)
Not sure we we felt that we where almost home
Leffe is NOT a Trappist beer but commercial 'Abbey' beer by AB Inbev
Visiting the EU parlement as a highlight says something about Belgium i guess
The lights balance out our atrocious roads
That way you can see the pothole that will wreck your tire
We have the Aquino family from maasmechelen, large scale drug trafficking and a couple of violent hit's by what might be a local branch of the Italian maffia
The more I read about him, though, the more I get the feeling this Hitler fella may not be the standup guy he made himself out to be
I feel like Flanders and Wallonia will split up at some point
We, Brussels should be a tax-free enclave
Which would be funny because Flanders has the majority of the Belgian population
Historically, Antwerp province is just a part of Brabant
Some people tried to change its name to Midden Brabant once
I've never in my life seen a stray dog but I know there are some stray cats
Stray dogs are very rare here
Stray cats are a bit more common, but I wouldn't say we have a stray cat problem
I've seen a couple of dogs without owners around
But generally I assumed they do actually have an owner
Like maybe a dog from a farm nearby that walks freely around in the neighborhood around the fields of cows etc
I never saw a dog (in Belgium at least) that I honestly thought was homeless/ownerless
Stray cats do exist
We put the fat parts of ham or stuff like that outside on a little plate for the stray cats in the neighborhood
But I don't think they're that many that they're a problem
Farm dogs just walk around freely yeah
But they're pretty well behaved whenever I see one
Yes, Dutchmen love dogs
One of the reasons why I love the Netherlands so much
Here we often have the friends and family party seperated
I can remember when the family was here, I opened presents when everybody was there (so everybody could see what the otherd had given)
But with my friends, my mom always forbid me to open them one there were still kidd because if people gave biggere or smaller things, nobody would know it (and I to would have already forgotten who gave it)
Distances in Europe are in general way shorter than the US
A two hour drive is considered VERY FAR as in my case, that gets you across the country
I guess depending on where you live there isn't much to do on a bike over there
Belgium is as you can probably expect a collection of small towns mostly(because history) so the kids use a bike to simply travel everywhere in the town
I had a sports center, hobbies(football field), swimming, shopping, school, etc
etc
all within 2 miles of me so by the time I was 12 I was free to go wherever  I wanted because my parents knew there was nothing I could want outside of town basically that wasn't right nearby and I wasn't going to drive my bike 20 miles to the nearest big city
Put a line of 1k kilometers on Brussels and see how many capital cities you can reach
I've been watching a lot of things in regards to countries on youtube(from the US, Germany, Japan, Korea, etc
etc
) and one is an American family with children coming to Denmark and how they would for example never let a 16 year old take the train alone back at home
American kids have it ROUGH imo
Basically no freedom at all
So no, most of them couldn't take the bike at 12 with some friends to go play a bit of sports half a mile away
*Boke mé choco*
So a slice of bread with chocolate spread ("Nutella")
It just tastes of childhood nostalgia
Turkish Dürüm
Mitraillette
sandwich " (Filet) Américain préparé" with raw vegetables
Very popular here
12 euros last i used it for a return to basically anywhere in the country
A standard ticket can be as cheap as €2,50 or as expensive as €21,50 depending on how far you're traveling
You can also buy a 10-ride-card here which will net you
€85
About
€8,30 per ride
Granted, you can go from one end of the country to the other for that price
Otherwise there's a variety of subscriptions you can sign up for if you know you'll be taking the train daily, and cheaper tickets if you're planning on staying exclusively in certain regions like Antwerp or Brussels
So the average price for a ticket is gonna fall around like
If you ask a Belgian, too bloody expensive
If you ask just about anyone else: very cheap
The train company is a gov company
So the prices are subsidized
A ticket from Antwerp (north) to Brussels (centre) is €7
A ticket to one of the longest distances: Antwerp (most north) and Arlon (most south) is about €21
However if you are <26yo, you qualify for severely reduced rates with the Go-Pass (€6
6 on any destination, even less if you buy a ticket of 10, which comes down on €55 euro for ten destinations anywhere in Belgium)
If you're a daily commuter you can also qualify for a single destination subscription which is 1) cheaper; 2) often covered by your employer
If you're under 26, a train ticket to anywhere else in the country will be €6,60 both ways
If you're over 26, you don't get very far for that price
There's tons of special ticket rates and subscriptions which are not too expensive if you take the train each day, but it is definitely pretty expensive if you only use the train occasionally
Not to mention that the amount of trains, their reliability and punctuality is god awful
I guess that's the price of only having one railway company
6,60€ for -26yo, no matter the distance
A lot more expensive for adults
10km is something like 3,50€.
I really can't wait to visit Italy and travel around by train
My parents did that a few times and they are always gushing about the trains there and how cheap they are
Wow, I've never thought about it from the perspective of someone living just across the border
You can get some crazy bargains if you live in or near the extremities of our country, though you would need to be patient enough to sit on a train for really long as well
I have been commuting daily to school for almost 10 years, then back and forth to university on a weekly basis
As much pet peeves as I have about the SNCB/NMBS (and believe me, I do have an awful lot), I think they do a pretty good job of running the trains and they've definitely improved over the years
^(Though they could improve even more if they addressed my pet peeves
Imo the NMBS/SNCB gets way more hate than they deserve
I rarely have problems with them
I've only been taking a train once week for the past 6 months (and always the same route), but I've never been late (except once because of technical issues with a train) so I'm fairly happy with them
Here in Belgium we see they railway service as bad but if you actually compare it it's pretty good
Only annoying thing is that it works with nodes around a few big cities which can make some trips unnecessarily long
I have never understood the hate for them either
Coming from Germany, using the train here is absolutely amazing
Very cheap (with the Rail or Go Pass) and pretty reliable
I've commuted by train for 2 years quite smoothly
People who say the trains are late all the time must have been spoiled somewhere and have never been to Germany
A lot of lines go to Brussels first before branching off
Before the long series of regionalisation reforms that started in the 1970's, Belgium was a very centralised nation, with Brussels at its centre
You can still see that today when looking at the lay-out of the railway and motorway infrastructure, or how the postal codes radiate outwards from Brussels like spiral
Even today, institutions like the Flemish government or the Francophone government (Wallo-Brux), have their seat in Brussels, even though the majority of the people they represent don't live there
While not a public institution, I think it's noteworthy that Italy's stock market is in Milan, and not Rome, which underlines the importance of Northern Italy's economy, compared to Central and Southern Italy
And Brussels isn't even part of Flanders but the Flemish government is still there
Don't Turkish cities have flags
> especially since Paris has fewer inhabitants than Berlin
Paris' population is a lot bigger than just the city of Paris itself
If you consider the whole agglomeration, you get around 10-12 million inhabitants (depending on the definition)
Berlin on the other hand only has about 4-6 million inhabitants
The Flemish government also represents the Flemish Community, which does cover Brussels though
A typical example of Belgian ingenuity
Yeah I know, I was talking about the Flemish Region
Don't know how it is in other places but here every province and almost every city/town has their own flag: [some are pretty cool, some are pretty boring, you can see them here if you want]
The flag of Friesland is amazing
And Utrecht too imo
We actually didn't have any mandatory books, but we had to read a couple of books each year by Belgian or Dutch authors (in essence, originally written in Dutch)
I did not actively dislike any of the ones I read but there aren't any contemporary or historical really famous works in Dutch and that's because most of them are just very basic
Not particularly bad, but not particularly good either
"Le Hussard sur le toit" ("The Horseman on the Roof") by Jean Giono
I should have just watched the movie, it was sufficient to respond to the exam
Too much description of the country side in the novel, it was excrutiating
I remember staying all night long up drinking coffee
It was worthless in the end since the questions were super easy
I'm Flemish, so not really a national classic, but every pupil in my school is required to read "Les Misérables" by Victor Hugo
Our French wasn't even that good, as they made us read it at the age of 14
Litterally most boring book ever, especially if you can't understand half of it
If I can burn all the copies of that book, I would definitely do it
I also had to read Le Père Goriot for school and I could not finish it, it was simply too boring
The only other book that I could not finish was Madame Bovary
It felt like the main subjects of the book  were disappointments and boredom
Floris ende Blancefloer
Had to read the original medieval text and it was a horrible experience
Dat stond er dus niet
Het was ook niet zo dat we enige inleiding hadden gekregen op de Middelnederlandse/Oud-Nederlandse (weet al niet meer welke) taal
Het was gewoon voor de les Nederlands, zonder enige context
Bruh imagine being so dumb
The real issue is that the USA has an absolutist view on free speech that allows easy radicalisation of people
These people are praised and hailed within their community
They do it to turn into a martyr
This needs to be cracked down on
You should not glorify mass shooters as this inspires others
Banning guns is a quick way to slow down the radicals while they are cracked down upon
I do think you can get away with loose gun laws if you keep the community on the right track
Honestly I don't really give a fuck
The Americans can do what they want in their own country
They can jerk off to their gun for all I care it's none of my business
I don't understand their obsession over guns, but whatever floats their boats I guess
Was coming here to write this
Comparing Switzerland with the USA is like comparing apples with pears
Until an American mentioned it this morning I didn’t even know that Swiss citizens can have guns, and that says a lot
I did some research on Swiss gun laws and read that gun owners are screened and trained before they can have a gun (correct me if I’m wrong, though), but in the USA you can literally just buy them at Walmart
Don’t compare a country with good gun laws to a country with horrible gun laws
Cheers, fixed it
I absolutely have enough disposable income, and I don't make sacrifices to have it
Overall my life quality is pretty sweet
The thing that I feel we are behind compared to others like the USA is the ability to make a lot of money
It's difficult to go above a certain threshold due to very high taxes (I'm not saying that is a bad system, it's certainly very egalitarian)
For example, I'll never have a "buy a sports car or a new BMW with this year's bonuses" money, it would take years (plural) of savings instead
In other places this seems banal
In my home country in the South, I absolutely did not have disposable money as I have now
Personally my goal was to buy a 200k apartment and with my median income(about €2100 after tax(we also have more than 12 months of income and all that)) have a 25k buffer and just begin investing everything above that
While paying the mortgage I could easily save about €800/month + another 3k or so every year in "bonus" so that's about 12600 every year in savings
My goal isn't to have a lot of money, I'm cheap as chips, it's to no longer need to work
Parents are wealthy
I did the boats, sports cars, 10k+ trips worldwide and honestly
not that amazing
Not necessary
Not worth the stress to try and earn a lot of money imo
Small apartment, second hand car, relaxing job > big house, sports car and stressful job
Also remember that the entire "retire early" basically requires a passive income you're happy with until your pension kicks in when you get a nice bonus on your passive income as well
If I say, get €1500/month passive that would be enough for me to retire at say, 45
But when I get to say, 60, I can expect some pension(not a lot because in this case I didn't work a lot of course) to top it up more
Not really true, in Belgium there is a growing (and very real) concern that retirement funds for current generations are fucked, if you want to live comfortably in the future it's wise to invest
I had a 600EUR bonus on my December's paycheck
Netto
250EUR
You'll never become rich by working (for someone else) in Europe
You'll need to have own a successful business, flip-houses, be a slumlord or work in an investment bank or top consulting company
That said, quality of life is pretty good and you'll never be found lacking for anything
Overall I'm happy with this arrangement
I remember being surprised by how much Americans made until I knew this
50k? That's insane
I thought
I make about that but see about 28k.(no dependents, not married, etc
so tax wise I get screwed :p)
Wouldn't it be then be way more useful to state post tax income since that's what you actually get
Yeah that's true, fair enough
As a French-speaker I happen to forget a lot about words in my everyday life due to the fact that all the medias that I watch these days, all the people that I communicate with, from youtube to reddit to twitter, are in English
So when I talk to my friends or anyone else, I often sneak english words in my french sentences because it's the words that pop up in my mind
I forgot how to say "ladder" in French
I had to make my mom guess by saying "oh yeah, you know, the long bars with other bars in the other direction".
This isn´t really uncommon in Europe, Belgium has 3 official languages and pretty much every Fleming also speaks English
Granted the third one is not a required subject in most studies (German)
Personally, i LOVE Finnish
Its super hard to learn, but when i listen to Finns speak, or Finnish music, it almost sounds like a spell/echantment being cast, something magical to it
Danish, it has the word edderkopp for spider
In the French-speaking Community, it's La Une from the French-speaking public service broadcaster (RTBF)
In the German-speaking Community, it's BRF
It's the German-speaking equivalent to RTBF
AFAIK it's the only German-speaking Belgian TV channel
In Flanders, it's één from the Flemish public service broadcaster (VRT)
~~RTBF, BRF and VRT used to be one TV channel
They were - as far s I know - not one TV channel as the language split already happened when there was only radio available
Wikipedia says this split happened in 1937 already
If you have Telenet, then Eén is on channel 2 and VTM is on channel 1
In Flanders, Eén is the most popular TV channel
Is La Une the most popular in Wallonia
Or is it RTL  TVI
The Belgian version of RTL is quite crappy though : commercial/private channel, that favours sensationalism over objectivity, and seems directed at a non-intellectual/non-educated public (and of course, has a very center-right wing bias, since it is a corporate TV channel)
Oh ok, corrected
I always thought they split up when Communities where created
It was RTL TVI for a long time but nowadays it's La Une
I knew it was way sooner, but not that soon to be honest :) I thought it happened somewhere in the 60s maybe but as it seems, they were practically always seperated
Same in French : *tu* one person you are familiar with, *vous*, which is the second person plural, is as well used for formally adress one single person
Belgians fixed that for you
I much prefer being in a country with Wallonia than with the Dutch
We have cultural and political autonomy in the present Belgium while the Dutch would no doubt assimilate us due to the size difference
We are already connected enough to them as is
Doubt I'd be the only one with that viewpoint if it actually came to happen
Lot of people could be found for an independent (within the EU) Flanders but I think comparatively few would want to be Dutch
can't we just unite with Luxembourg ? Everybody loves Luxembourg right ?
we have a prince with nothing to do, they can have him
not just the US
Fuck \*runs to closest castle\* do we have to kick someone out again
i'll call england and france
let's just keep belgian royalty away from anything delicate
I like my african countries alive
I dunno
I dont reply to such threads if they don't apply to me
Relax dude
Or leave
Basically your options if you say you hate this place
Not a hospital worker, but
Non, moi, je suis belge, pas française
I used to believe that all countries had a national monument, like the Atomium, Eiffel Tower, Berlin TV Tower, Big Ben, the Colosseum, Akropolis, Pyramids of Giza, and the Great Wall for instance
We all have a name, flag, anthem, capital, head of state, abbreviation, national animal, and more after all
I was always found it odd the Netherlands didn't seem to have one
We once asked a Dutch woman somewhere in Switzerland and she said probably Windmills
Only later did I realize that these national monuments aren't as universal as these other country clues
**Just for fun:** If I didn't name your country's "national monument", what would it be
Honestly I thought the same
I think in Poland the national monument could be the castle of krakow
Idk if that castle has an official name tho lol
Funny anecdote from a Belgian
I was speaking Belgian Dutch in my local dialect to my family on vacation in Austria and some shopkeeper I believe asked if we were Swiss
Mistaking the 2 dialects
I can see why though as both probably have some French influence
I'd not be surprised if many Belgians would want to form a single country out of the Benelux tho
The Dutch, English, French and Germans all tell these jokes
You should have, and it would be glorious
You have the Deltaworks
Those are honestly more impressive than any of the others
I would say it's Kinderdijk, or maybe even the Afsluitdijk but yeah, it isn't really as conclusive as in other countries
Where I live, that's just a bit of trivia
Yes you're right, and most of us know that but at the end of the day it's still just Big Ben for us
Google Images speaks for itself
Yeah, I guess the Brandenburg Gate might have been the better pick
It just never really impressed me as we have the [same thing] in Belgium yet nobody **ever** talks about it
You can even go up close to the horses when visiting the nearby military museum
I had only ever seen the Atomium and Eiffel Tower at that point so I guess they influenced my thinking
I honestly wouldn't mind much
Imagine the economic power
I agree with you except for maybe "special rock formations" (i.e. mountains), like for example the Matterhorn in Switzerland, Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Everest in Nepal and Uluru-Kata Tjuta in Australia
We do but that's just because we're quite a big family (not a large amount of children, everyone just lives to be very old) and no conventional table would be able to have all of us at it
So there's a "kid's table" (I use parentheses because half of the kid's table are legal adults), but it's fine
I've more in common with my brother, nieces and nephews than my parents, uncles, aunts and grandparents
Belgian here visiting the French city of Vichy today
Didn't expect to be that hot (max was 38C°)
Why would it be rude
No, that's why sandwiches and durums are so popular
My noon meal is often a sandwich I eat on the walk from the restaurant back to the workplace
Time is money
"Belgium is a loathsome chocolate goulag" -John Oliver
‘I pause to ask myself what it’s like to be a Belgian, if there is such a thing
Too proud
Too masochistic
Difficult to decide
Like the mule, it seems to be a country without pride in paternity or hope of posterity
’ Christopher Hitchens in Slate
Belgium was created to annoy the Belgians themselves
That, is facts my friends
According to Wikipedia there are 30 positions in our Court of Cassation
I would say that the relevant courts for this comparison are either the Constitutional court or the State Council
The State Council is the highest administrative court in the country
It is composed of 44 judges who are distributed among 15 sections (7 Flemish, 7 Francophone, 1 bilingual) that oversee different kinds of cases
This is also the State Council that reviews the laws before they are voted by the parliament
The Constitutional court is there to make sure that no legal act in Belgium contradicts the constitution
It is composed of 12 judges
- 3 Flemish professional judges
- 3 Flemish former politicians
- 3 Francophone professional judges
- 3 Francophone former politicians
They must be at least 40 and are nominated for "life", but they actually have to retire at 70
There is a political equilibrium in place, so that the court reflects the political trends of the parliament
For instance, if in the parliament, the social democrats are the first group, followed by liberals, greens and christian democrats, then the 6 judges (of that linguistic group) will probably be something like 2 social democrats, 2 liberals, 1 green and 1 christian democrat
If the green judge retires and there is a vacancy, it will be up to the green party to nominate someone
Then, the senate has to approve the nomination by a 2/3rd vote
Oh okay I just looked up 'supreme court of belgium' and the 'court of cassation' popped up
And Wikipedia said that that's basically the Supreme Court
You're right that the court of cassation is also very important, and is the highest court for what it's doing
Basically, in the US they have only one court (supreme court) that oversees everything, while in Belgium we have several specialized courts for different jobs
Cassation's role is to make sure that all the rulings by other courts are made in accordance to the law
It will not rule on the content of the case, but on how it was conducted in lower courts
If there were irregularities in the procedures, then the cassation court will break these rulings and a new trial must be held
But it won't say anything on the content, it will not rule that X is guilty or innocent
Thanks I had no idea how that all worked
> So when a German wants to say 76, he says “Sechsundsiebzig” or “six and seventy” as opposed to “seventy six” in English
Same in dutch
Pretty much
Dutch for 26 -> Zes(6) en twintig(20)
German -> Sechs(6) und zwanzig(20)
It's pronounced like way but with a t in front of it
It turns out the army barracks ("Francisca Barracks St
Tonis") where I during my military service is "disused".
Apparently, there is "stuff" in the soil that needs to be handled before the site can be used for another purpose
Not per se barracks but around Antwerp the were 2 fort-belts from Napoleonic ages untill ww1
One of the forts, at the suburb Wilrijk, is property of the university of Antwerp because the university has an "outside campus" that is right next to it
There are now (before Corona) a lot of party's for students
And it is PERFECT, no old people that just hate our fun, no young families with babys that have to much noice
Just drunken students in an old fort
There were barracks in my village but they have been turned into shops
The municipality bought the barracks from the state because the state wanted to turn them into a centre for asylum seekers
I work in a refugee center in Belgium in what used to be an old army base
The refugee center has been in operation for over 20 years now, but it still has a very 'military feel' to it: an abandoned guard house at the entrance, the 'decoration' that's clearly from it's previous use,...
Where in Belgium
Sint Truiden
It's a trend we see on a countrywide scale as well
r/Belgium uses English as the lingua franca (though posts in all 3 official languages are allowed) and is filled with Flemish and has little to no Walloons
Walloons are present but I think they are not very active on r/Belgium because that sub is more Flemish oriented
r/Wallonia has been growing exponentially recently
It's just passed the 10k milestone
Stromae, Lost Frequencies and maybe also Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike
(and K3 in the Netherlands
EDIT: Loïc Nottet deserves way more recognition imo
The guy is a legend when it comes to music
Obvious ones are Jacques Brel, Stromae, Arno/TC Matic and a couple of DJ's/EDM artists
* Vaya Con Dios comes to mind as well
* Toots Thielemans
* Adamo
* Luc van Acker
* Technotronic (Pump up the jam)
* Praga Kahn/Lords of Acid
* Soeur Sourire (the singing nun)
* Helmut Lotti
* Axelle Red
* Front 242
* Lasgo
* Hooverphonic
**In other genres and more my cup of tea**: Amenra, Wiegedood, Oathbreaker, Channel Zero, Aborted
Some 90's fame goes out to the H8000 scene with f.e. Liar and Congress
Technotronic - Pump Up The Jam
I didn't know since a couple of months ago as a Belgian myself
Bonnie Tyler
Alan walker ?
2 Unlimited, Deus, Vaya Con Dios, Hooverphonic, Kate Ryan
Charlotte dewitte, amelie lens, marco bailey, joyhauser ...
The Scabs,
The Radio's,
Soulsister,
Milow,
K's Choice,
Novastar
Can't forget Hooverphonic
Rocco Granata can be considered as Belgian
Django reinhardt
Soulsister
Amenra
TIL Hozier is Irish
Master's Hammer
K's Choice also had quite some international succes with Not An Addict
You have so many artists who are way more popular than the guy who won Eurovision, though
I don’t even think he’s on the radio outside of the Netherlands
Rosalia
Not every shitty europop is Dutch
They still play Everytime We Touch at parties from time to time
Arch Enemy, Amon Amarth, Soilwork, Hypocrisy
In all honestly, I’ve never heard of those
Channel Zero, Aborted, Amenra, Ancient Rites, Ithilien, Steak Number Eight, Brutus, Enthroned, Diablo Blvd
and Fleddy Melculy
Not sure how popular they are in other countries, but I like Ancient Rites as well
I salute you, internet stranger with good taste
A lot of Europeans know him, though
I know people (non-Belgians) from all over Europe and they all knew him
Forgot that one
I know 1 song of Margaret but I also don’t know the rest
He is in Flanders
And most people know the song, according to my empirical research based on having heard 'ooooOoooOoOoOh' from more people than necessary
They're all techno dj's all of them touring around the world
Lots of Belgian dj's are popular around the world, but only with fans of their genre not in the mainstream
It's all Belgian metal of various kinds
Do you know many of the things other people say
The majority is modern pop and metal
Definitely glad I was aware of this before I went on exchange to France, I like to think it made most of my interaction quite pleasant
That's  what I am used to do as well in Belgium
Say hello to the entire waiting room or when someone else enters
Not everybody does it though
In the current times of Covid however, when I enter the doctor's waiting room, I just let out a deep cough
It mosly gets returned by some coughs from others
I feel like Patser is one of the best flemish movies made recently
Nawww you spoiled the ending
I LOVE Song of the Sea
Book of Kells too
Great animation and story
Not animated though
Cheese
That is all
Poepen is to shit in the Netherlands but to fuck in Belgium
The tight situation mainly arises when the Dutchman uses it in Belgium
Belgian French and French French aren't different enough to have tigh situations in case of weird use of expressions I would say
But there could be one ones
A towel (such as for shower or bath) in Belgium is called "un essui", while the French say "une serviette". Serviette in Belgium means : a napkin, generally paper one
So, ja, having a French person asking for a "serviette" while what he really wants is an "essui" is a bit odd
It's generally small details like that, variations in the vocabulary that could breed strange situations if the other person isn't aware of said differences
Some pronunciation is different too : â is Belgium is a long a, while most French people pronounce it like a normal/short a, so, they pronounce pâte (pasta) and patte (animal leg) the same way, so, orally, for a Belgian when they say "on va manger des pâtes" (we'll eat pastas), we actually hear "on va manger des pattes" (we'll eat animal legs)
Same goes for ê : long è in Belgium, short/normal è in France
'Vol zitten' is also used as being full from food in Flemish and I've never heard someone say 'sleuren' when they mean kissing
But all the other ones are true and the first one is really funny
Where were you in Belgium
Because in my part of Belgium, excité means as well : sexually aroused
Excitant however has a broader meaning not limited to sexual arousing
isn't it neuken
Yep true I remember watching Disney Channel and Nickelodeon as a kid and when somebody said 'Ik ben aan het poepen' my parents always looked at the tv to see what I was watching
can confirm: sleuren/bekken/muilen/een tong draaien are all used here (region East Flemish-Brabant)
also poeppoepen I've never heard, we just say anaal, or in a more vulgar way: "in de kakker nemen"
'Geil' is Dutch for horny
I really don't care if they are popular or not
I have a beard, and have one ever since I got laid off
There used to be an official office policy of "no facial hair allowed", meaning I had a moustache and never really got promoted
I now find shaving a waste of time and prefer to trim every week or so with an occasional visit to a real professional barber (now long overdue because of Covid)
Beards used to be something for old men, and monks
The occasional hippie too lazy to shave
But I must add, the number of men having a beard seems to have grown
Nowadays, a well-trimmed beard is a common sight
Those who can't grow a full beard without looking like a homeless crying in silence
Among 20-30-40's, it is more common to encounter
Not this popular
Women don't like them that much
Men are into it, but can't grow it, and even if they can, they're not worth the title of *beard* but rather  pubes
Women huh
Something you have common with Turkish people then lol
Where I'm from there have always been people with beards but it's like 15% of the people, whenever I have a beard it tends to be because I just didn't see the point in shaving it
>but can't grow it,
Really
I'm 18 and me and multiple of my friends have to shave our beard at least once a week and I think it's only going to grow quicker once we get older
Maybe we're exceptions though
Al die willen ter Kapren varen, moeten mannen met baarden zijn
Jan, Piet, Joris en Korneel, die hebben baarden, hebben baarden
Love how that song has different language versions
I am also 23 and I can also only grow a mustache + ugly version of a Lincoln beard
Very little hairs on my cheeks and my mustache doesn't connect at all with the rest
So clean-shaven it is
Luckily the average man's beard growth keeps improving well into his 40s, so maybe one day
I would like to have a Santa beard when I am retired
Or in case I don't end up with white hair, a thick mustache
You know, the "old man" look
I didn't mean to generalize every men in this country, but I think you know very well that >80% can't grow a *decent* beard
Honestly, I didn't know that haha
Hahaha fr fr
Well, i live in Oost-Vlaanderen and I'm a lot in Antwerp en this is what I see everyday tbh
I think the days of our Golden Generation are over sadly, especially seen the last few matches
We have some new youth coming in, but the coach continues to stick to the older experienced players, which I can understand in a way because they're battle-proven
But the defense with Vertonghen especially has become slow af
I reckon we could get semi's though still with this group
Boycotting the WC in Qatar as well
the worst thing for the belgian team is the current situation of Hazard
We need that creativity in our team
With his dribbling he can always force an opening in every defence
I believe in the boys, they will put up a fight and it's not like the other teams have their best form
It's now or never
We mustn't forget that we are in March, in the home stretch of the season  and that all the big teams also make shitty matches
KDB (who did not do his defensive job in the last match) for example thinks more about the CL with City than the selection
But yes the defense is worrying and if Eden Hazard and Witsel withdraw for the Euro, we must hope for a miracle and a great Lukaku / De Bruyne
Martinez also needs to learn to change tactics during the match
We don't know much about him and Martinez arouses the interest of the big European clubs
yeah,it would surprise me that he will come to Celtic
Given they just barely scraped past San Marino I sincerely doubt
True heroes <3
French, I'm probably one of the few people who has fond memories of French language camps
German, because it's almost Dutch, so everything sounds weird and cool to me
Portuguese because what's not to like about that language
An Russian just sounds amazing
Finnish and Hungarian
Both just sound so enchanting, like someone is casting a spell on me
Beautiful languages
Scottish English makes my panties drop
If you say something in German, it automatically sounds a lot sexier
I mean not that anyone really speaks it but Latin has a lot of cool words
Like ‘sanguis’ (blood) ‘Aquila’ (eagle) ‘silentium’ ( silence) ,...
Isn't it that you just like Sloan
I mean, who doesn't?
hej hej Monika
Not my country, but I know ser Francis Drake is a popular figure in Great Britain but a villain in Spain
Leopold II, though somewhat controversial in Belgium, he built most of the grand boulevards and huge buildings
Wouldn‘t say Belgians are really against him unless they‘re quite left
Doesn‘t have a great name internationally
Considering Dutch survived in Flanders while being suppressed for 100 years, I'm not worried at all
We're very proud of our language
I believe you underestimate how much governments have a hand in languages
Some regions are rather protective of their language
It's not just a case of what people speak
As long as the current French government exists for example French will continue to exist
There are so many dead languages, not really my main concern
I'd prefer a communicative language that functions globally
I work in Belgian government: everyone either natively speaks Dutch or French
The young Flemish/Walloon people find it easier to speak English with each other, whereas the older folks would usually switch to French
It is
A single team meeting will have the spoken language constantly switch between Dutch, French, and English
Sometimes you even switch mid-sentence if you don't remember a specific word in the language you're speaking at the time
And if a team member's native language were German, they would be fully in their right to speak German as well
I do wonder whether that has something to do with the incapable reputation of the Belgian government sector
Yea, I wish (dutch person from Belgium)
Post war butter smugglers
I've heard some wild stories about them from my grandparents, we live on the border
Ambiorix and his Eburonen come to mind, but that's about it for Belgium
We all know about knights anyway
Yeah that kind of sounds like what I heard, converted old army trucks and shootouts at chasing customs guards etc
Today - since I wouldn’t have had too much right during any period in the past
There's a flemish skit where someone from west-flanders (region famous in belgium for it's incomprehensible accent, similar to bavaria to germany, friesland to the netherlands and the USA to the UK) complains about being undertitled and/or dubbed
When the news undertitles it, a follow up skit shows him complaining with text written in the local dialect on cartboard (which is also undertitled)
In Dutch they don’t dub, they use subtitles over the English version
Never put mutch thought into this as i read them for the first time very young, but you're absolutely right
8 in Belgium
I'm not black myself, but I have witnessed racism towards black people
I once saw the police called on a black sales person, simply because some idiot thought it suspicious that a sales person were black
The police didn't even do their job right and actually sided with the racist
The poor girl was too nice and didn't want to create a ruckus
She left her job after this
They thought it better for keeping the peace if she quit
Rubbish excuses of course
I wouldn't call the Netherlands Northern Europe
Would you say it's more Greece with Balkan influences or Balkan with Greece influences
If it was splitting up Europe between North and South I would put the Netherlands North but I would seriously wish to cut Belgium along the language borders for that one
Walloon in Northern Europe is weird, Flanders in South Europe is also weird
It's more or less a Germanic/Latin border
Same reason you can make a (rather bad) argument for Belgium being Mediterranean
It seriously influenced us as well though nobody would call us that
With good reason imo
Mmm, you're not necessarily wrong and I can see why you say that
I think it's because the difference you see between Northern France and Southern France is the difference I see between Flanders and Walloon
It's rather identical
Industrial North
Less wealthy, more nature South
Putting the line at along the vineyards of France has it's appeal though
Ow, for sure
As I said, it would be an awful argument for us
It's just that it exists as an argument
Latvian and Lithuanian are more closely related than Dutch and French
And neither do my guests
Yeah I always do that
And when other people come, it depends from house to house if you have to take them of or not
Onion soup
Mussels used to be poor people food
Same in Belgium
The ingredients don't even matter, it's whatever you can find
It's bassicly jambalaya but with potatoes
And in terms of interior, [this starbucks in Gent St
Pieters]
Done
good luck with your research
Mia by Gorki is probably a good contender for the flemish part
Edit: actually, I'm not sure, it fits with the definition you gave but it's maybe not as emblematic
I don't really know for today but Jacques Brel songs sure were emblematic and knew all across the country
I reckon that kids wouldn't recognize it unless their parents listen to Brel
(Belgium)
Definitely [Mia by Gorki] At least for Flanders
Just such amazing song
RIP to Luc de Vos, what a legend
If you want to know the text, [Milow] did an English cover that's actually not even that bad
But obviously nothing can tip the original
Pretty much none for Belgium
You'd be hard pressed to find someone here that actually knows the anthem in the first place
That's probably just because the singer died a couple years ago
Made me think, was Brel iconic as well in the flanders ?
It was pretty iconic before as well though
I think [Laat ons een bloem] by Louis Neefs is a good contender though, and for Wallonia [anything by Jacques Brel] will do
This may sound a bit snobby, but he definitely is as iconic with the people who know French
Didn't even realise that song was Belgian
That's the problem though, because we are divided into Dutch and French speaking parts (German part as well), there aren't many 'Belgian' songs
You have flemish classics and Walloon classics like the one you said
Because it was in French I always thought it was from France + I don't know much about music
I know it's iconic but I wouldn't consider it a second anthem but I could be the only one here
Plenty of bands and artists recorded in multiple languages and had succes in both parts of the country though
For example Jacques Brel, 2 Belgen and Wannes Van De Velde all recorded in different languages
Recently Angèle and Stromae also had large succes in all of Belgium
Good point, but
While these are all Belgians indeed, do their songs make you feel 'emblematic' of Belgium
I don't think so, hence my answer that no song does
[Rabbit with prunes] is a classic dish here
It's considered to be for more special occasions, not your weekly routine dish
It used to be, but it’s getting less and less popular
Google "Flemish Giant rabbit"
Fuck yea we're eating those
Have to know where to get it and such though
Anything except for cow, pig and chicken will be a matter of knowing what shops sell it and such
Duck seems more related to Eastern regions but I've eaten those in Vietnamese dishes and such
Yes it is very normal in Belgium
dogs, cats and insects
I guess ?
You people even eat snails
Studies, but I'm returning to Colombia on February
Visit colombia :D
Flanders and Walonia
What about Slovenia and Slovakia
Wait
Is it another one of these live action Disney reboots
If yes, then I'm definitely not hyped
Those movies don't bring anything new to the story and are just a shameless cash grab on their past success
But you say that it's an Italian movie, so not Disney
If yes, then why not, it could maybe bring something new to the table
He is talking from a base biological/sociological point of view, in which case he is right
It has always been a competition, not sure why you're trying to make this into a higher level point of view
Societal progressiveness has always in part been about trying to overcome primal instincts, but that does not make them disappear
Some of it does, others don't. The letters in the periodic table reflects their latin names
Since dutch is not a romance language, it often doesn't "make sense", but sometimes it does anyway
Most match in Dutch, like Na (natrium), K (kalium) and W (wolfraam), but not all:
H = waterstof
C = koolstof
N = stikstof
O = zuurstof
P = fosfor (no ph in Dutch)
S = zwavel
Fe = ijzer
Cu = koper
Rh = rodium (no rh in Dutch)
Sn = antimoon
Sb = tin
I = jodium
Au = goud
Hg = kwik
Pb = lood
Potassium comes from the Dutch word potas (pot + as) because Flemish (and maybe also Dutch) farmers knew they could fertilize their crops with potas
Yeah it's the same as dutch, only we write stof not stoff
there are a lot of regional dialects, and they're usually spoken within families or towns, but outside that everyone speaks the same flemish
older people use it more commonly in my experience, the youth speaks slightly more of a standard flemish, dutch, english blend
Very interesting overview
Same applies here in Belgium basically
Speaking the "normal language" just sounds weird
West Jutlandic is really cool: it lacks grammatical gender
The article en is used for countable nouns (apple, house, car) and et is used for uncountable nouns (snow, water)
Does anyone still speak like this
Or has everyone switched to Standard Danish
In my hometown Antwerp you have almost anything tbh, including good mexican tacos which seems to be a missing element here
I imagine the same is true for Brussels
Ghent I imagine will lean heavily towards the Turkish side, due to a large turkish population
Then all the smaller towns it's mostly friteries, kebab and (american style) pizzas
Kebab restaurants and Italian ( often combined:’ pizza and kebab ‘) also chinese takeaway restaurants and sushi bars
Of course there are also the big burger an pizza chains: McDonald’s, Quick/Burger King, Dominos, Pizza Hut
Kebab isn't Arab, it's Turkish
Kroket uit de muur
I know 1 good american style pizza chain here, all the rest are meh
I especially dislike pizza hut
I don't know if it's the same in all countries but pizza hut tastes like flavored cardboard / plastic here
I know 1 good mexican place, it's small and lets you fill a tortilla or taco with over 20 toppings to pick from
I can't compare with the US since I've never been but it's pretty good, especially compared to bigger chain mexican places
I think we're in a group where we might expect some more controversy before the tournament starts
We have to play in Russia and against Russia, but there's so much controversy about their sport associations that it wouldn't surprise me if they will be banned from competition (just like another ban by IOC and IAAF)
If Belgium and France face each other again during this tournament, that will be a heated match
Easy group and I think we'll even make it to the finals with a team like ours
I couldn't care less
Counties will soon drop their songs tho
Brazil didn't even manage to qualify for the Euros in 2004 though
I'm pretty sure most people just say 'en-teken'. I had never even heard of ampersand untill it was a question in a quiz a couple weeks ago
>	Was het leuk op het strand
Ik, een intellectueel:
>	Meh, &..
I use both terms but use 'en-teken' more because, as this thread shows, it is more well known and it is clear what you mean
'Ampersand' is the term I'd use to my fellow students in mathematics or CS related classes
> like most people i reaaaaaaally dont want the troubles to start again
this is something I'm wondering about: is there a genuine scare that the Troubles are going to start again and is there a rise in propaganda for unionism ?
As far as I know (and you probably know better than me), Norway doesn't rely on oil for its revenues

It's not part of the culture around here, but I have an uncle who is consistently 30 minutes late at family gatherings
So nowadays, we say to the rest of the family *"Oh, the party is at 14

30h."* That system works fine

I always wondered why
Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp and Liège were much more important cities throughout history
I just assumed it became rhz capital because of its central location and the fact that it is bilingual (I think it already was bilingual when Belgium became independent but I'm not sure)
This was after the Belgian revolution though
Also, the Spanish besieged and plundered Antwerp, leading to a massive braindrain from the south to the north
All wealthy merchants and other important people fled towards Amsterdam, leading to a massive surge in population and importance
In 1567 Antwerp had a population of about 105 000 people, Amsterdam had a population of 30 900 in 1564
After the Spanish Fury and siege, Antwerp had a population of 46 000 in 1591, while Amsterdam had a population of 59 551 in 1600, increasing more and more with the years
A lot of Flemish and Brabantian people fled to the Dutch Republic and had a massive impact on culture, language, wealth etc
Ik geef geen kloten

"BOEIEUH
It's short for "dit kan mij niet boeien". Literally "this can't handcuff me".
We have quite a few but in my region we also have like one word that just can be used for "fuck it/i don't care/don't give a damn shit" and that beautifull word is "Foert", since we have the rolling R in Flanders often, u ephasize on that r and roll it a bit extra "foerrt"
Also:
Het kan me geen moer schelen
-> It can't bother me a bolt/nut
Het kan me geen bal schelen
-> It can't bother me a ball
Het kan me een worst wezen
-> It could be a sausage to me
Dat kan me geen moer schelen
(Actually nice information though, but I don't think it matters in today's context, as little to no people know this and direct google translate wouldn't translate it as such)
Well, I was speaking about sayings in Belgium, so
and I'm pretty sure "moer" as moeder isn't used here at all
About 80% of the worlds billiard balls are made in Belgium
We had the first openly gay prime minister in Europe, Elio Di Rupo
Eventhough we are tiny we have the most castles, 3000 and the longest tram line in the world of 68km
We have the lowest salary gap between men and women in Europe
We host the worlds largest sand sculpture festival and electronic dance festival (tomorrowland), Europes largest cultural festival (Gentse feesten) and a ton of other music festivals (38 big ones and a lot of smallers ones)
“Fallen Astronaut” by the Belgian artist Paul Van Hoeydonck is the only piece of art on the Moon and oil painting was invented/reinvented by Jan Van Eyck
We are one of the best firearm prducers
We make the p90, five-seven, FN FNG, FN FAL, ...
FN Herstal also made half  a million m16's iirc
Also the second country to allow euthansia
And we have good beer, although that isn't uncommon to know
The most translated books in the world, after the Bible, are those about Inspector Maigret by Georges Simenon from Liège
Belgium has more comic book makers per square kilometer than any other country in the world (even Japan)
In Belgium, Flanders specifically, you can bet Home Alone 1 or 2 will be on TV during the holiday period

Yes that's the one :)
I agree those are horrible, though lately i haven't seen many of those  .

Friendly people, good food, great atmosphere
Indeed, the architecture was beautiful and not only ancient buildings but also modern
Also good atmosphere overall
Het smelt (it melts) by Lise spits, if it is available in English you should read it
The exact thing is happening to Flemish separatists uff
Loud minority and now the world thinks we hate each other and every Flemish person wants separation
Actually, Lybians didn't have it bad under Khaddafi, it was the most developed country of North Africa, the ones with the highest standards of living
The ones who opposed Khaddafi were islamists
So, we should have fought alongside Khaddafi, not against him
Lybia is a mess now, much worse than under Khaddafi, which had made of Lybia the most succesful country of the Maghreb
Indeed, we can't compare the case of Catalonia with the Middle-East
If Russians support Russia, does this delegitimize Russia
I've heard Spanish speaking people literally say "Pardon de vous molester" (sorry to molest you) because molestar is to disturb/bother in Spanish
I don't have any example about people who learn dutch as a new language
But it's always weird to when people from the Netherlands speak with Belgians, because there's an overlap between what's informal in Dutch in Belgium and formal in Dutch in the Netherlands
Normally *U* (German Sie - French Vous) is the polite form
But it's also an informal declension of the older *Ge* form (Du - Tu), which isn't used in the Netherlands
It's like it always confuses them (the dutch), and they never seem to get it right
>Извините пожалуйста, вы не знаете где находиться библиотека?
In Russian class, can confirm I would ask it this way
Or maybe drop the не and находиться. How would you say it OP
the hardest thing any language is to know the little peculiarity like the one you mentioned
For myself I think the hardest thing for normaly strenger in french is soixante-dix et quatre-vingt-dix
In Colombia, I used the formal "su" for for everyone because you do the same in French
In Spain however, apparently, it's ok to use tu by default
Speaking of which, let's say I want to visit Russia some time, I understood that Russian people really appreciate when a foreigner tries to speak basic Russian
How would you say, for instance, "Hi, I'm a tourist, can I speak English
" in Russian
It's "juffrouw", there's no v in it
Ah yeah makes sense
Shorter and less overly formal
Septante and nonante exclusively
Never soixante-dix, huitante nor quatre-vingt-dix
Ah yeah usted is the word
Su is the possessive form right
I always mix these up for some reason
You know the hardest part of learning Spanish
You guys speak to fast it's incredible

Mask conspiracies and 4G Towers conspiracies can go suck a massive bag of dicks
In no particular order:

Don't know actually but I think it'd be like that
No arguments there
As a small country citizen, I love the EU
They do all these things against big companies that we would never be able to do
Sadly their security is very much alleged and unproven, so in that regard little improvement over WhatsApp
EU employees have been required to use Signal over alternatives such as WhatsApp or Telegram for a while now, due to espionage concerns
It's funny but i don't like the fact that if it was any other ethnicity/nationality/other it would  be deemed racist and bigoted
That's double standards i guess
Edit: wow didn't know only joking about Americans was allowed, but hey since it's not a race or ethnicity, it doesn't count /s
A lot of people just don’t understand Western culture
Freedom of speech (and consequently of religion) *is* the right to offend
Frankly, I find a lot of aspects of Islam very offensive, but I will always defend your right to be a Muslim
More islamic community leaders need to hear this and repeat this
Why is this an issue
For example, if you criticize Jews, you're anti semitic and if you criticize the moslims and mock with them, you're talking of freedom of speech
That's just bullshit
When heavily accentuated, especially with a Parisian accent, it's quite vulgar
The systematic "-euh" sound that replaces the normally silent "e" or even no "e" at all ("bonjour-euh") and the engorged quality make it so
Southern accents are quite nice and euphonic though
i think its just not in sync
> There are plenty of muslims that embrace European values but those aren't on the news
"A lot" like plenty of people, sure, but not "a lot" like a sizable part of them
Check Pew research on values, it's frightening
Agreed
65% of Muslims in Europe say Sharia is more important than the law of the country they live in
And Sharia is not a joke, it's a pretty horrifying set of rules and values
There are plenty other surveys like that
The support for many unacceptable things is super high among Muslims, even in Europe
The road is still very long
it's a pity you don't see that
I'm not confused at all, I'm quoting serious surveys
And I'm not the one dragging the conversations toward emotions and prejudice, that's you
You're answering to data with anecdotes and still seem to see no problem with being smug
People in here with their 'innovation is dead now' crap
If a better charger type comes along that all manufacturers can use they can ask to make that one the standard
Also it's not for the port on your phone or tablet
Fuck you Apple
But chargers are already universal
Only the cables aren't. I guess it's a good thing power bricks will finally move away from the old USB  but it won't change much
I can charge my Android phone on Apple chargers already
Apple never circumvented anything because cooperation with the initiative was voluntarily
They also never included any sort of adapter and it certainly doesn’t cost €40
Brexit party, thank fuck it's the last day we have to hear their BS
This is from the point of a company that only cares about it's own profit and not innovation in general
They are free to innovate the standard
They don't need to sign anything for the law to apply to them
But it wasn’t a law from what I remember
It was an EU initiative and compliance with it was voluntary
It is quite pricy indeed, currently in their store at €25
because fins have strict rules on distance between people
Why would you want this art to considerate the freedom brought by cars when it is focused on how much space has been taken from pedestrians
Yeah, lately the pedestrian are getting very dangerous and jaywalking everywhere or literally waiting at the red light on the crosswalk path while it's green for the cars, I just drove a bit in the last hour and I witnessed this
all the cars swerved to dodge those idiots and nobody layed the horn because we're so used to them to be so entilted
Even worse the cyclists that absolutely have no clue about the circulation rules so just burns every red lights, ignore any priority but firmly believe that they got the right of the way every time because *bike*.
It's more and more unbearable to drive in the center of any EU western cities
It's hyperbolic
Of course the street is not a huge deadly hole
The vacuum represents unusable/unallocated dangerous space for pedestrians
This is great

I understand her point but I think player's salaries in football are always an easy point of attack
Messi and Ronaldo earn exceptionally high wages
But CEOs that manage big companies as well, just like them they are important to keep the company or the club afloat
Not a lot of people actually think about the money it brings into the economy
In flanders, belgium, our football clubs brought in around 700 million euros to the local economy alone
I think exceptional case is a vast understatement
In Spain footballers tend to get taxed over 40%. Is that not enough ?
I understand it perfectly well
But you're clearly missing the point
It's completely useless to complain that others earn more as this has nothing to do with the current issues
Not to mention that this is clearly some fake Facebook shit that some made up

Bit similar here (Belgium)
My grandfather had survived a lot (Tons of surgery + heart attacks)
Several times the doctors had said: he’s nog going to make it
Yet every single time he did
So when covid hit we were of course rightly worried
On top of that in oktober 2019 his wife/my grandmother had died (alzheimer)
The home were he lived went from no infections to almost everyone infected on a week
They locked everyone in their rooms so no one really saw anyone (besides nurses/doctors)
At first he was fine, still high in spirits
He did get infected but for about a week the symptoms were mild
Yet by the second week it got worse incredibly fast
They found him on the floor one day - he wasn’t really aware of his surrounding anymore
So they rushed him to the hospital
At the hospital the doctors said that probably wasn’t going to survive the night
They gave have pain medication to ease the pain
Yet he fought on for another full week
The doctors were honestly surprised and told us he was also always super friendly to the staff when he was awake/aware of his surroundings
He ended up passing away in his sleep, I hope peacefully in the end
My dad and my uncle were allowed to briefly see him (in full PPE) in the hospital (was surprised this was allowed), so at least they still saw him
For that uncle and my aunt and niece it was especially hard since they live in Japan
They only come to Belgium once a year, and in the end only my uncle got to say goodbye
Therefore when I see people calling this a hoax or flaunting the rules, frankly it disgusts me
Thank you
Hopefully you and your family are also doing fine
We got lucky with the funeral
We had to wait a while to have it but when we did Belgium had reopened and we could gather together (+sunny weather) as a family
Naturally we had plenty of food and a nice cake  (grandpa loved to eat and make huge cakes)
1 week after the funeral several countries limited travel to Belgium (most of my family doesn’t live here), so we got lucky

And I know stupid people will misinterpret this but no my logic isn't that we should get another vote for every year of a new batch of people getting the right to vote but when its been three years along with the fact that Brexit is not going anywhere and been a complete mess it makes sense to have another vote
Lets also not forget that no one knew what they were voting for to begin with and votes were made on nothing but guesses on what was right rather than hard facts about Brexit that we have accuquired now

So Brexit wasn't a referendum questioning Britain's sovereignty but was in fact solely racist at its core
Now look, I get that the news cycle around Brexit and the EU has been dominated by the topic of immigration and the payments by the UK to the EU and that a lot of this was plain false
There's no doubt about the propaganda perpetrated there
But as someone with a masters in European Studies, from a pure political point of view, there **are** a lot of unanswered questions in regards to the EU's encroachment of national sovereignty
It's an ongoing debate, but there's equally no doubt about the UK's constant historic and cultural opposition to furthering European integration
It's not a question that can be answered by simply pointing at racism and propaganda
It's a society-wide philosophical question of identity and it is very much relevant to contemporary politics in the face of ever increasing globalization

Speaking from Belgium, the high speed trains are here, the tracks are here, they were largely funded by public money, but then neoliberalists demanded that they be harbored in self sustaining solvent companies and the best way to do that is to brand high speed rail as some luxury option for business travelers and tourists
When really, the infrastructure is suitable to serve as a solution for commuting
But then you need to stop selling numbered placed, sell yearly subscriptions and increase train frequency by a lot
Not something these semi-private companies are able to do in the structures they were forced into
Just shifting taxes isn't going  to fix this
Trains should be treated as a public good and their offering tailored to benefit the most people possible
I've been to China, where the trains are subsided heavily
Could do over 1000kms in 5 hours for €90 on a bullet train
If the EU were to make a network of such trains it would help a lot
Just
only connect the major cities to it
Otherwise it misses the point
E.g. Sevilla - Barcelona - Bordeau - Paris - Brussels - Amsterdam
The state of train transportation for a densely populated area like Europe is unbelievably bad
Nations need to work closer together when it comes to high speed international travel, and they need to make it way more affordable
To be honest, airplane travel between European nations (at least Western and Central Europe) should be scaled down way more
Do indeed heavily tax non-transcontinental flights and use that tax to increase the quality and ranges of the european rail network
High-speed rail is not designed to host commuters
Not in Belgium, not in France, not even in Japan
More subsidies might entice some upper class and upper middle class commuters, but that's it
Nationalisation won't change a thing
Japan's HSR is run by privatised companies whereas France has publicly and privately run HSR
Either way they're too expensive for the vast majority of commuters
They're just trains
There's nothing magical about them that would make them unsuited for commuters
there's trains running every day that could take me from my home to a job in Rotterdam in under an hour, but it's completely un-affordable
Stupid artificial way of stifling the economy imho
why can't I just get on the train when I want to like any normal train
We're such weak fucks for putting up with this bs
It's unaffordable because these trains are very expensive to run
HSR is far more expensive than conventional rail both to build and to operate
HSR operators worldwide aren't just randomly jacking up prices for the sake of it
Good, let's stop with importing US problems
May we never see times like that again

I think they were less hard on Germanic countries

I was hoping for falling of 28 flights of stairs but this is also ok
Why does everyone want everything cheaper, buying cheap clothes thanks to child labor, ...? This is gonna destroy the EU
who wants to bet we will find out in a few months that Russia has been funding and promoting these protests
&#x200B;
that's not the point, it's your democratic duty to protest  when something is clearly not in the intrest of the majority of the people
It's is also your duty to be skeptical and doubtfull with people inciting hate/violence/anger
just have a look yourself which hashtags have been the most popular amongst known russian propaganda accounts:
even if there is a genuine purpose to these protests, know that there are people out there who just want to see them escalate and create division and chaos
Mental how such a small piece of paper can trigger the Brexit snowflakes
I love my country
Still has no government
Didnt know we lived in anarchy
Pushing with shield is physical violence, like clobbering somebody's head with a blackjack
Many things can go wrong
Pepper-spray and the target is temporarily out of commission with minimal impact to their health on the long term
It hurts like hell, but at least you don't get broken bones
Or he didn't expect something shoved right in front of his face and react with the pepperspray
But I can be wrong, even 2 pictures can't completely tell the story
I try to exhaust all other options before attributing something to malice
(still have a sliver of hope for humanity
Edit: to clarify
This is still police violence towards non-violent protesters
I just don't think this was politically motivated like some other commenters believe
I can see how my intial post could have been taken as me trying to find an excuse for this officer
You're not wrong
Fascists love plausible deniability
Which makes it extra hard for us to call them out
Let's try not to attack our friends in the confusion
This police officer is "just doing his job", and I think the problem here is not the fascists in power beating and macing their opposition in the face, but rather the police beating and macing non-violent protesters in the face
I think regardless of who would have stood before him and who was in power, thet officer would have sprayed
That's the problem here (at least based on these 2 pics)
The legislation is good, but [needs to close loopholes as well]

Recently I saw some news that some supermarkets in Moscow were now equiped with terminals where you could pay by scanning your face in stead of like scanning a barcode on your phone or just using a card
I wonder why
Brussels and Ghent don’t fit this in my opinion, Antwerp does ish
Super accurate for Liège
Needs more dystopian blocks and no river (and thus no bridges) and this is 100% Brussels
Jokes on you
My city never had a likeable old bridge, and the discussion for the new one has been going on for more than a decade now
(Though it's already hated)
There's Stalingrad Avenue in Brussels
> Super accurate for Liège
Especially the Pingeon-owned central station
That one gave me a chuckle

Easy way to keep the corona death-toll low for your country, just execute anyone infected by it
They can't die from Corona if they die from bullet
Awkwardly close though
They've learned absolutely nothing
I guess they'll be at our side the next 4 years and then it'll be another toss-up
Nature is healing
It's going really well I think
they got to count till they knew who won, even though the ruling president really didn't like it
but he couldn't do anything except go to the courts, which is good, that's his right
But if the judge says no, it's no, even if you're president
Picking kamela as his vp was either a brilliant move to rake left votes, which I suspect the lack thereof was a factor in Hillarys defeat, or a geniuene attempt towards improving the life of the working man

In any case, biden was a return to normalcy, for better or for worse
Trump destabilizing effects on the world will linger for years to come, so I for one am happy he is not given legitimacy by getting a 2nd mandate
And if all that doesn't sound like an improvement at the very least we, the rest of the world (who forced trump down our throats by mass media), will no longer have to hear the manchild speak, read his incoherent tweets or be staggered by the fact he cannot admit even the simplest mistake
We know cofeffe was you fat fingering don
We know that the sharpie gate was you trying to contribute to a conversation you knew nothing off
No more will he get to self insert In the tiniest things, and I welcome the peace of mind that is at the end of the road
With the changes of the last 20 years the president does have a lot more power now than ever before though
(for some reason giving one man a lot of power is a good thing
I don't get it)
As a result he can actually do a lot with executive orders and such
The bigger problem is that 4 years from now everything is going to go to shit again I think
Biden isn't a strong candidate
He's just better than Trump by a long shot
He's talking soft power
Ow, he's fucking awful
He's just better than Trump
This is a 4 year gap
Either the Dems over there do something with it and find something to root for instead of against
Or we have another Republican in 4 years
take all the crazy conspiracies about the state being controlled by soros and Jews and mix that with satanism hysteria and everyone I don't like is a pedo
But the 50 year old trucker listens to Glenn Beck and if Democrats suggest an actual solution to his issues, he will be convinced it's part of a communist plot to take over the country
The only reason to vote Biden imo
If that's your top concern, Biden is your guy in this case
It still saddens me that global warming is a political issue at this point
> That would be like funding Al-Qaeda to fight ISIS
2022: Vote republican "to keep the president honest"(midterms tend to go against whatever party is president)
2024: Democrats still morons and Republicans still racist
Racists win by default
I mean, I would be willing to bet €100 on this
Republican gains in senate in 2022 and Republican president in 2024
I mean, I don't disagree there
Romney for example wouldn't be the worst thing
I do question if he still has a chance though because of the last 4 years of criticizing Trump
They fought ISIS as well
Big clusterfuck over there
Yea, the first 2 years is just Republicans going full obstruction
They're going to point out Biden didn't keep his promises
And that's all they need to do
Plus some more right leaning democrats that wanted him out of office as well
Could work
A more left republican party(read: not fucking bananas) might also allow the democrats to go more left(hell, it could plainly force them to)
Long live First Past the Post
And to think that De Wever said that us in Belgium should consider taking cues from the US election system
Fuck that shit
Yea, I just want to know what's it going to be in 4 years against Biden(if he runs)
The Romney/Caine type or the Trump/Hogan type

In Belgium there’s a huge difference between Flanders and Wallonia

So stupid
I got in contact online with someone there
She Said she sometimes had to rush inside because there was a wave of poluted air they couldnt breath
In fact, There’s quite a few people living there that love it
Sure, Its really not healthy to be there but
y’know
Russians have a kink for vodka and snow
There’s a comment in this thread about a man Who left that place at 17 years old to study in S.P. He Said his parents and him love it there for the reasons I stated
Well no, not really
For example, a lot of people find my hometown boring
Indeed, there’s not much to do
though I fucking love my hometown
Its a kind of nostalgic love
This is what I don't get
How don't people realize that, if you promote women because they are women, you *establish* the preconception that women are less competent than men
The logic is extremely simple:
* Your team is supposed to have the most competent people available
* You give women a slight advantage over men, because women are not particularly common in this field but you strive to have at least a certain number of women in your team
* As a consequence, women are hired with lower standards than men
* As a consequence, men have to be more competent than women in order to join your team
* As a consequence, **the men in your team are more competent than the women in your team**.
* The result: everyone in your team feels like men are more competent than women
* Congratulations, you are now part of the problem while you were trying to be part of the solution
I don't understand how you can be a manager in a company and *not* realize this
I disagree
If I've learned anything in my education (organizational psychology) about hiring people, it's that the selection process is not about choosing the one who seems to be the absolute best person
It's mainly about weeding out candidates that are unfit for the job
If you have five people in the end phase, selected out of hundreds of applicants, it won't have a big impact who you choose
Definitely don't justify your pick by bringing in gender or race, but at that stage just pick the person with the best fit for the company
Someone you can work with, that fits the company culture you need
Some research even indicates that the ones that score higher on aptitude tests or did better on their degrees, will feel more entitled to the job and will try to prove themselves less than people who were slightly less qualified
And selection tools aren't all that accurate for predicting performance on the job
Not everything translates well to a quantified variable
Valid point

This thought eats away at me too, apparently the concept is called [paradox of tolerance] as I saw it mentioned on reddit a few days ago
Which is exactly how most European legislations handle free speech
You are allowed to express your opinion, but hate speech is forbidden
Regardless of this man's political views, brining the Nazi salute in Germany is forbidden by law
You either respect the law of the country you visit, of you get the fuck out
Pure and simple
Context might be of some importance here
maybe he wasn't a random person but someone paid to do this, in order for them to have a "reason" to fast track something to appease lobby money ? We'll see, if this news just disappears in a few weeks
Very effective
Does that mean we must bow to our drone overlords now
I hoped we’ll have more time
Or was it just incompetence and mental castration of British services and army
Shooting this drone down would be a discrimination against drones and their culture maybe
That would explain a lot
Pretty accurate for Belgium, except there's 6 of them that are all slightly different, with their own governments but also one for all of Belgium, and the same party can be both in a government and an opposition at the same time
Otherwise, pretty accurate
Honestly pretty accurate lol
Liberal is neither conservative, nor progressive
Communist would be the opposite of liberal although not entirely
Most liberals in Europe could be better described as capitalists
As most Western European countries are liberal (in the old meaning) and socio-capitalist welfare states, most capitalists (liberals) are somewhat socialist and most socialist are somewhat capitalist
Most debates are in essence about where the equilibrium between socialism and capitalism should be
as a belgian, both the socialism duo and the racist duo is humorously accurate
In Belgium the liberal conservatives took also the seats of the covert rascists
It's the only real party name in there
Populist=covert racist
Tho if we dub em liberal conservatives i'd say to keep in mind they are only partially economically liberal and partially socially liberal
Same goes for the conservatism
Also the covert racists really aren't all that covert given all the shit prominent members have done whilst being allowed to remain in the party
I don't think there are "proper right" parties that don't fall into "liberal and conservative
" "Christians" and "covert racists"
the area around Berlin even has a desert according to another poster here
Do Putin next
For a moment, I thought Denmark had a sign language person (can't think of the right term)
It's really fun to watch
I think it's supposed to be a much needed sign that the EU and USA are still mostly sharing the same interests and there will be less moves where the USA doesn't warn the EU like Trump did
At least that's what I assume Biden is present for, I've got no idea if they were actually discussing a topic involving the USA
The drones are invading
Brilliant
Amazing human being, regardless of what I, or anyone for that matter, think of his beliefs
But it's so sad this situation ever even arose
We need to prepare better for these crises

He's lucky, my grandfather often tells about the townspeople (in Belgium) beating collaborators and Nazi sympathisers to death in the street after the war
Very stupid, doing such a thing so close to the end of Nazi Germany

The Sovjets killed 7 out of 11 Wehrmacht troops, sacrificing 20 million+ of their own men
Now those Americans apperantly did all the dirty work
Yeah, they faught hell at normandy
But that is still small compared to Leningrad and Stalingrad’s horror
>They were the only ones that were against Germany from start to finish, so they were absolutely essential
The Munich agreement disagrees
Nobody Said anything like: ‘(nation) defeated Germany all by itself
Were just measuring who contributed what
And it is obvious that when you look at pure statistics, the USSR contributed the most
But they deffinetly Did not win on their own
The Soviets Most casualties were in te beginning of the war against Germany
After That, they still suffered But on the other hand, the Germans suffered more during their retreat all the way to Berlin

This kind of weather always ends up reminding my that most people don't think logically
In countries that regularly have weather like this people stay inside (or at least avoid hotspots like this place in Delft), public transport doesn't ride out, etc
Then you follow the news in the Netherlands and people are literally being blown over the market square, take their bike to go to work/uni then get blown over, busses get blown of the street, containers get blown off ships, etc
I mean seriously, what are these people thinking
Look at Norway with the first-world problems haha
First I see Greece and Belgium which are kinda sad
Then I see Spain and Portugal which make me realise there's worse things than sad
Then I see turkey and I go straight back to sad

It's probably fake, but if it was real, I would assume they are inside jokes and pop culture references rather than actual questions
Which is why they are in English: people are probably more likely to Google such questions in their own language if they actually care about the questions themselves
Like, for example, if we look at the German one 'how do I breathe without choking' I would assume that it's the title of a comedic Youtube video or a joke made by a standup comedian, or something

But what do we do when its 45° all summer in a decade
I'm gonna start blowing up our bridges just to be safe though
That doesn't change anything as there is no one living in that neighbourhood

Radicalisme grows well in good earth
The radicalisme can only thrive because the soil is kept wet by the 5

I know it's not a popular opinion, but in Belgium the MP's also referred to dancing Muslims after the attacks in Zaventem
Don't act like this is an issue of the "last years". In France alone + 270 people died in the last 20 years in the hands of Islam Radicalist, because thats what they are, not terrorist alone
It's uncontrolled multiculturalism and politic correctness that has brought us this mess
A childish believe by the former generation of politicians, that when you mix cultures at the end of the ride, they all share beers together in the park under a bright rainbow
Enough is enough
It's sad that the far right is the only party screaming against it, I don't want that either, but still, you need a means to a solution
And this solution will not be free and easy

I want my children growing up in an Europe with the values that I grew up with, because they are right and brought social security to millions of peoples here
This kind of behavior by Religious Idiots (because that, and only that is what they are) doesn't have a place in this society
Not once, not even let alone accepting it 100 times in the last 30 years

Things have not been  looking good for years, the only problem is, everybody is ignoring it for years
It has to be dealt with
> Given current demographic trends
Nope
> [...] a “high” migration scenario projects the record flow of refugees into Europe between 2014 and 2016 to continue indefinitely into the future with the same religious composition (i.e., mostly made up of Muslims) in addition to the typical annual flow of regular migrants
In this scenario, Muslims could make up 14% of Europe’s population by 2050
It would literally take more than 200 years for the muslim population in Europe to become a majority if current trends continued
And they probably won't. Hell, the current fertility rate for the muslim population in Europe is barely above replacement rate, at 2

Stop your fearmongering
Explain yourself
Shun, denounce and report the rotten apples
Their inaction is their own undoing; they will suffer for it, while the extremists celebrate their martyrdom
Those acts keep nudging people towards people that don't tiptoe around the issue, eventually they come into power and will take action
And it won't be pleasant
And nobody is going to speak out for the moderate muslims, as they themselves didn't speak out against their extremists
It's nightmare fuel
It could range from mere closed borders and forced repatriations to pogroms where police is told to stand down or even organized rounding up of unwanted elements
God knows we Europeans can be quite efficient if we set our mind to something
It's really up to the larger Muslim community to solve this issue asap
It's in their own best interest
I never had any doubts whether the question was genuine :) Cheers
[What would make cycling safer
They're all far more important than wearing a helmet
In The Netherlands, literally almost nobody wears a helmet, including kids (aside from *very* young kids) and cycling is safer in The Netherlands than anywhere
Not to mention, forcing cyclists to wear a helmet sends the message:"cycling is dangerous" into the world which makes some people stop cycling and switch to driving instead (this happened in both Sweden and Australia) which makes the road more dangerous for everyone
If people want to wear a helmet, by all means, but governments should never even run a campaign to encourage people to wear a helmet as even that causes cycling rates to drop and driver rates to rise
If governments are so concerned about cyclists they should give them proper infrastructure

I really didn't have an opinion on brexit, one way or another, but after *years* of passive-aggressive cringy shit like that it becomes more and more sensible
Please remind me in which country the capital of Europe is
If this is all it takes for you to make your mind up on Brexit, you’re a moron
Really, you just admitted having no opinion on it, probably because you’ve never actually thought or looked into what it would actually mean, but somehow *this* cartoon swayed you one way
Utterly ridiculous
You’d fit right in with most Leave voters
Belgium then
> they can’t admit
I would say that you're the one using feelings and bias
In reality we must admit that we just don't know
Brexit hasn't happened
Maybe it will be cataclysmic, maybe it will be hardly noticeable
Until then the *"you're so stupid and mean to leave us"* could stop, it doesn't help anyone

Socialism means that the worker owns the mean of production
This means that there isn't some cooperate backroom meeting that is trying to figure out how much stock value they are going to lose researching in different chemicals
There is also some greedy fuck somewhere that is counting his years and money and says: "Meh, I am not going to live long enough for this to become my problem".
Yes, I am socialist in this cooperate/capitalist shithole that we call the western world
If you think I deserve to die, don't worry I think the same about myself ... . The only reason I carry on, is because I want to see how far capitalist are going to be able to push it, I want to experience true cyberpunk and then I guess I will just jump of a bridge somewhere ... .
That's true
Insects are the most important multicellular animals in the world
People know that bees are important, but often forget about the other pollinators like wasps, beetles, midges etc
Not to mention the colossal ecological role that those animals play

The soviet union had some twisted form that was called lenism
Venezuela looks like a capitalist country with a socialist party at power
Vietnam did not stop being communistic after the US left, however the people never owned the means of production
> No, this means trying to understand the needs of the people instead of the markets, which result in empty shelves
I don't get it
If you try to understand what people need it is pretty obvious that they need something to eat
Why would this result in empty shelves
In a Market it is more profitable to figure out what the highest bidder wants, and try to produce that as **cheap** as possible
> And there are greedy fucks in socialist countries, counting their millions, laughing at you
If a "socialist" country has greedy fucks that are capable of exploiting the system for themselves
Then it has failed to implement it properly
The problem with socialism is that it never ever has been able to be implemented properly because as soon you get a socialist commune/country it is free real estate for capitalist countries
What is also the reason why they will try to shield themselves from the world
Yes, but very few animals can adapt in such a short time period
>  Keep trying, you socialists will get it one day
I also hope you get to experience the full free market as well
And I know that we are mostly talking theoretical thingies, while the market is tested and it "works". So excuse us socialists for being vague, it isn't as clear for us as it is for you
our numbers are not that representative either
Belgium has stopped testing regular people with symptoms, we only test those considered at risk or clearly deteriorating
our numbers are basically counting only whoever shows up at the hospital (and the healthcare workers), the rest is told to stay home and quarantine themselves
but yes at least all our experts and politicians are clearly stating on the news that this is the case and you should expect there to be many more cases out there
I wonder if the cultural differences in terms of touching eachother during interactions etc play a role

How is trump an idiot
Very probably
There is talk of tabling a UN resolution that condemns the NK missile as an "intercontinental ballistic missile", [but Russia says "we cannot confirm that the missile can be classified as an ICBM"] So possibly Putin is Putinsplaining to Merkel how her little rocket trajectory movement is incorrect
Notice how he nods no after her arm movement, and she then rolls her eyes

The latter one is something often done in Belgium when possible

Must be a regional thing, I've seen more Fiat 500s and Dacia in th north of Italy and of course a lot of panda but not as much than the 500s
I'm amazed there's a lot of pictures of big roads and little people on them (as in little carriage, but also very few people walking)
but then it's norway so maybe it's still that way there
I find it interesting to think about how much human life changes, or doesn't. Technologically, we're just on a different level from even a few hundred years ago it seems, but at the same time you can read something like Marcus Aurelius' meditations and still feel like it's relevant to our life almost 2000 years later
I'm very disappointed we're not on the list

Wow, many former USSR countries

Gonna go against the stream here, but no, most aren't. Most vote for nationalistic Russian leaders, including Putin
Putin his support was actually wavering, with nationalistic Russian political movements protesting against him in earlt 2010s. It's to appease that significant part of the Russian population that Russia started this entire expansionist path, starting with the war in Georgia
Then the unlawfull annexation of Crimea, now this escalation of the war in Ukraine
A lot of Russians are very nationalistic and are supportive of the [Ruskkiy Mir] (Big Russia) idea

A Croatian family walking in Brussels
This is next to where I live, all my local bars
Really nice place, especially in the summer when everyone's outside
It's the Parvis de St Gilles, in 1060 Brussels
There are some seriously salty French people in this thread, because we (Belgians) decided not to root for them and instead cheer for the Croatians
Do you not see that this is normal
Croatia was in the same position as Belgium this World Cup: an underdog team that hasn't ever reached the final but has the promise of a very good team
Of course we're going to cheer for Croatia
They got to second place, while we could not
Don't worry French, we don't hate you
But do understand that we're not going to support you in the finale
I would applaud too
Croatia played amazing and if our Red Devils would have met them at any point in the cup, I would be biting my nails
Croatia is an amazing team and you can never ever let your gaurd down while playing them
Pfff 1060, it's 1000 or nothing
Too hot in Finland
Like 14 degrees
not allowed sry, go torch some car somewhere instead :)
Why can't it be both
Rooting for Croatia because they played so well and because you don't want the french to win
It's not toxic
There are plenty of Americans here
And there is this neighborhood in Brussels where everyone speaks English
It's called the European Quarter it's where all expats go when they arrive

You're welcome
Yes for sure
It's less touristy than the Grand Place area
Lots of young professionals live there, students, very multicultural, a bit gritty
Check out the original Moeder Lambic, all the bars on the Parvis, Dillens, etc ...

They aren't in the military
They're cadets
These specifically only started a couple of weeks ago
They'll only have had a couple of "gatherings".
Nah, unlike you guys, we don't like starting wars that destroy the continent
These aren't soldiers but cadets
They likely didn't receive any meaningful training yet
These aren't conscripts though
They're cadets - people who receive military training outside the work hours as a hobby
These one specifically were recruited a couple of weeks ago
They probably only just received their uniform let alone spent a lot of time learning how to march, etc
Also these people aren't in the military, so they won't even be involved with war
So like every other country with colonies then
these last 2-3 weeks have been so weird weather wise
I just want to let this out
I'm a Belgian but you have to understand the German need for energy
They are an economic powerhouse, they need energy

But Hungary is hardly a big player in the EU
His power lies in the fact that his EU representative can veto whatever new stuff EU brings to the table, but he can't impose or destroy laws of the EU
In short, he's an issue for internal affairs of the EU, not external like Boris is for the UK or Trump was for the USA
Edit: clarity
>But the President is constitutionally empowered to conduct foreign policy and to negotiate treaties
Yes, and the guy is suggesting an alternative to that
Constitutional amendments and such

What about getting approval after the terms are negotiated by the president
Right wing populists will always exist I'm afraid, but so far Western Europe and Scandinavia are doing fine with keeping them out of high positions, while Eastern/Southern Europe is trying to flush them out

BREAKING: During day 5 of the EU Council Summit, a coronavirus recovery fund deal was reached at 5:31 AM Brussels Time
Euro-sceptic are always going to complain unless you give them a bag of cash
It's not really something to listen to
This deal came out on our national day (today July 21st), so that's extra cool :-)
It's all fantasy
Economy isn't a hard science
In Belgium, people are seeing an increase in the money they receive monthly from the government if they can't work
We'll see how things evolve, I suppose
These are difficult times for governments all over the world
Not in this case
People out of a job already receive welfare benefits like they always have
Investment should only really ramp up after the virus has been convincingly dealt with
Certain proposed increases were cut or watered down
Nothing that already existed was actually cut
Also, it seems like we *finally* got a breakthrough in our government formation
Yay

>The Muslim world is always very good at finger pointing and preaching what is good or what should or should not happen but for over 500 years no Islamic country has contributed to world peace, human freedom and/or innovation by any measurable global standard
It's ironic to see people from the west take the moral high ground when the west (ok, mostly the US) has spent the past 7 decades overthrowing democratically elected leaders, staging coups, and bombing the middle east to absolute shit because there's a lot of oil
Indonesia, the country with the most Muslims in the world, is doing just fine relatively to other countries
You know what they lack
**Oil**.
Maybe if we want the middle east, and by proxy most of the Muslim world, to no longer be a shitshow, maybe we could stop funding fucking dictators in Saudi Arabia and Iran by buying their oil so that they can't keep shitting on the rest of the middle east
But noooooo
Condemn the Muslim world
But then sponsor shitstains like the Saudis by driving your gasoline guzzling car without questioning it
>most muslims feel empowered/proud after these atrocious attacks,.
There are 1
7 billion Muslims in the world
I sincerely doubt "most Muslims" have even heard about this attack
If you're talking about Muslims in France, source
>Why as an Islamic nation does Indonesia have Indonesian individuals earning 11 million USD a day and there are still people in the country that eat 1 meal a day and earn just over 2 USD a day
Same reason you see it in Congo
Same reason you see it in every undeveloped country
Corruption
It doesn't mean that Muslims inherently are bad
>Nothing to that scale would float in any Northern European country, our ancestors had that shit show in the Middle Ages and don’t want that crap ever again
So because us white Europeans were the first to develop and progress as societies (on the back of exploiting numerous other countries well into the 20th century), that makes other cultures inherently inferior
>There’s a reason many Islamic elitists love Trump and sponsor him
Are you fucking equating Islamic elites to the Islamic culture as a whole
So that means I can assume that Trump is representative for white people culture as a whole
Damn, us white people sure are a bunch of douchebags
>At some point the excuses must run out snd accountability should be held where it’s due
Where's the acountability for every western citizen that is sponsoring terrorist regimes like the Saudis by buying their oil to drive their cars
We're sponsoring the very regime that is funding whabbism bullshit all across the world
Where's the accountability
>Be critical of all power structures but start with your own and measure them the same way as you would the country you moved to
What the fuck
I'm white as fuck and Belgian as fuck
My family has lived here for generations
I simply don't see it as simplistic as:"Islam/Muslims bad, just look at Middle East".
>You have no problems putting all Americans in the same bag
Where the fuck did I put all Americans in the same bag LOL
When I mentioned the US, I was talking about their government
Did you think that I argued that every single American citizen went and invaded the Middle East
That's ludicrous
Americans are fine
I don't even condemn them for electing Trump (even though he's a total shithead)
It had a lot more to do with economic anxiety than racism
>you don't like it when people do the same to Muslims
I don't like people generalizing an entire population group based on their religion or ethnicity, but **I'm** the bad guy here
Are you sure that you belong in our western society
Because pretty sure that not discriminating people based on ethnicity or religion is a pretty core fucking value of western society
>If your point is that those Muslim countries have an anti-Christian mentality because of the attacks in their countries (which are totally unrelated to religion anyway, if they are pissed then they can go after the US for their jihad and see how well that goes), it is not for innocent people to pay the price and the more the reason to not let them into Europe
What you're asking is for them to be rational
Even though people are inherently irrational
Case in point: the generalizations of **all** Muslims that you're doing based on the actions of a small minority
Maybe practice what you preach first
>I am baffled how the more left thinking people are somehow defending killing in the name of religion in the 21st century
I didn't defend any killing for shit
I simply oppose blanket generalizations of an entire population group based on ethnicity or religion
And I'll keep fighting over that hill for as long as I'm alive
>A religion where anywhere you go gay people are non-existent (or else) and women are little better than dogs
In Uganda, being gay is punishable by death
Uganda is over 90% Christian
Are you advocating that we deport all Christians too
If not, why only generalize all Muslims, not all Christians
/u/djolera got banned according to further comments on his account
That's just

>However I am ruthlessly critical of the power structures in one of my Islamic cultures
So am I.
What I am also critical of is the complete shitshow that integration has been in most of western Europe when it comes to Muslim migrants
We basically ignored them, allowed them to congregate in poor neighborhoods, and now we're wondering why they're not integrating
Meanwhile, my friend who was born here and is a Belgian citizen by birth, faces discrimination every week because of his skin color
And we keep wondering why they don't integrate
Maybe because they consistently are reminded that they don't *really* belong here

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our European dead
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of covid blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let masks cover the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful rulers,
Now set the teeth and don't stretch the nostril wide,
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height
On, on, you noblest europeans
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you
Be copy now to men of noble blood,
And teach them how to prevent
And you, good pleb,
Whose limbs were made in europe, show us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base,
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes

Straining upon the start

Well, I get what you’re saying but this is China we’re talking about
We can’t really force their hand, they just do whatever they want without consequence
The only way to force them is through government trade sanctions but due to our dependence on Chinese trade the governments don’t dare to do things like that
In other words; people don’t do anything against the concentration camps because they cannot do anything without sacrifice
The Netherlands had the same issue months ago and took measures
Denmark found it not to be necessary

I don't know about the "earn 29% more money".  They probably took the average of all incomes in the US, which includes many billionaires and even more millionaires

In the tea we also include a clear fact check-able brochure about what the EU is and what it did for the UK
Then we also pay the fine for littering and offer to clean up unconsumed tea like a gentleman
However I do not think we will have much work with the last one

But as far as sanctioning goes it's a good question to ask considering it's something that the US and EU in general do: sanctions on Russian, sanctions on China, sanctions on Iran etc
It's a logical question to ask, if hypothetically
Actually sanctioning an ally is ofcourse something different
(though the US is kinda doing that now with the whole Iran situation)

I didn't pay parking when I went to school with my car because fines over a week were cheaper than paying for parking
It was almost as costly every day to get a fine than it was to pay but I only got like 2 fines every week

€20
I think they raised it to €50 now
It's been 10 years
The point is basically to raise fines imo
If it was €100 I would just pay

We have mandatory voting in Belgium
Well, mandatory show-up anyway, what you do in the booth is your business
And I wouldn't want it any other way

With our system at least the average shmuck throws in his vote too, even if it is begrudgingly
Expecting your citizens to show up to vote once every two years is not a huge crime
Welcome to the club of having no government soon xD
If there even is any(?), the "PR budget" for the EU is extremely low
It's pretty much just a bureaucracy working in the background, pushing money around to where it thinks its helpful
There's no branch of it dedicated to PR work or such
If there was, that would be seen negatively as a waste of money
I'm an eurosceptic at heart, but there's no denying the many good things the EU does fund
They just generally suck at letting anyone know they are actually doing good things
If it devolves into using China/Russia methods that would just inflame anyone who's not a raving PRO-EU  follower
It does interfere enough with sovereign nations as is, and while mostly positive in nature, any shift towards authoritarian methods will just erode it's purpose and swell the ranks of anti-EU parties, quite a few of which are not particularly desirable on a national level either

Český in this case means Bohemian, not Czech
It is meant to distinguish it from places in other Czech regions with the same name
Yes, I was referring to the contemporary meaning of Bohemia - the western part of the Czech Republic
No, I am not wrong
Český can refer to the region of Bohemia or to all of the Czech lands (Čechy vs
Česko - same adjective)
Český Krumlov means Krumlov in the region of Bohemia, as opposed to Moravský Krumlov in the region of Moravia

It's almost as if cities were designed for people, not for cars
I think that the bikes fiets the place better
I think once we get rid of the car as the main mode of transport in condensed human activity areas (such as cities you see here), most cities will become more human friendly again
That's so great to see
Hopefully the rest of the world won't lag behind in the upcoming decades
It's really fascinating to see how the 50's, 60's, 70's there was this massive development of the current road infrastructure in most developed countries and how subsequently city infrastructure was adapted for cars
But only in the Netherlands, there was significant opposition against these car-centric cities
I always think that in 50 years people will probably think what the hell people were thinking in the 60's when they thought it was a fantastic, progressive idea to try to funnel as many cars through the city
I was in Copenhagen last December and I loved that street
We never planned to go there but just walking around the city, whenever you got close to it, the amount of people just draws you in
Which is retarded because almost everywhere in cities across the world where cities install bike lanes or even ban cars in a street altogether, retail prices go up as pedestrians and cyclists spend more in local stores than cars
It's almost as if not having to find parking space will increase the chance of people entering a local store
[Leuven Grote Markt] anno 1960
I've lived in Leuven all my life and that pains me to see
Glad we've at least made some stteps towards limiting cars
> Everyone likes nice things, but almost everyone seems to be afraid of any change that is going to affect them in some way, even when they're a necessary step to make things better for everyone
This seems to be a global sentiment
Last time I was there it was better, with very small circulation for cars, I think
And Brussels at the Beurs has gone permantly car-free, which is super nice, I can't remember how it was before because I barely went there before I was 20 or so, but now it's a really nice place
Leuven Grote Markt has been car-free since the beginning of the 90s now, I think or even earlier
I was born in 1991 and never knew any different than completely car-free

Making driving into the city less attractive doesn't automatically mean making it outlawed

>who, wow, don't pay any taxes to use roads at all
>We know, for example, that for every kilometre ridden by bike, the Danish coffers recieve 23 cents
>For every kilometre driven by car, the Danish state pays out 16 cents
>Those numbers are from the "Socio-economic analyses of bicycle initiatives - methods and cases", produced by COWI in 2009
[Source]
Just looking at the tax revenue and cost of building roads is extremely shortsighted
Every Euro people spend on driving and sitting in traffic is one they can't spend on improving their life in other ways such as a nicer place to live, more vacation, or even simply better food
Not to mention the fact that cyclists are far healthier on average than drivers, The Netherlands estimates their economic benefit from all the people cycling is [€19 billion a year]
But yeah, bad cyclists, don't even pay taxes
>Please show me an article from a reputable source, not some biker propaganda
Feel free to provide a counter source that accounts for things like driver related injuries/fatalities, healthcare costs due to more sedentary population and economical cost to congestion
Or show me where the "biker propaganda" is wrong
Just dismissing a source because it supposedly is biker propaganda doesn't give me much encouragement to try and find different sources which you may just dismiss without evidence again
>Also, how the fuck does the government coffer 23 cents for every cyclists, if they don't pay any fucking taxes
It's literally explained in the study
Did you dismiss it without even looking at it
>Governments receive more revenue from cars than they spend on cars
Even if you want to ignore the extra healthcare costs heavy car traffic brings due to increased obesity, pollution, and injuries, it's pretty clear cars also bring a significant negative effect in terms of space usage in cities
I've been citing that source for so long, I wasn't aware the link died
Here's a link to the [study]
In case you're interested in the [authors] which I assume you are
>The government still profits immensely from personal car ownership
Really
>We know, for example, that for every kilometre ridden by bike, the Danish coffers recieve 23 cents
>For every kilometre driven by car, the Danish state pays out 16 cents
>Those numbers are from the "Socio-economic analyses of bicycle initiatives - methods and cases", produced by COWI in 2009
[Source]
And Denmark is the country that has a 150% tax just on the purchase price of a car
So if you want to buy a car, you pay 2
5x what it would cost without taxes
>Cars aren't going to be disappearing anything soon, especially for people who don't live in city
Nobody is realistically advocating for
A) That all cars disappear
B) That cars can't be widely used outside of cities where there is ample space to do so
What people do advocate for is that we move away from the "car is king" culture that has dominated most Western cities and countries since the 1960s and that we ensure other, more efficient, road users have sufficient space as well even if that sometimes hinders car users somewhat
People can still drive into Amsterdam
But driving in Amsterdam is not the easiest way to get around so people simply bike
But if you want to drive into Amsterdam, you can still do that if you like
>Around the the same time the UK government collected £38billion in motoring related taxes, total roadworks cost them £3-4billion
Even after taking away other costs you want to lump in here, tax collected from car owners is a serious amount
This revenue made up 7% of the UK's total tax collected in a year
None of this accounts for everything else that comes with cars not to mention the fact that your society as a whole is burning money spending on cars instead of investing in actually useful things
And even if we assume the government makes a lot of money off of it, do you think that a system where people spend a lot of money on something that isn't absolutely necessary if adjustments were made, is sensible policy
It costs a lot to drive
Money UK citizens can't spend on other things
Doesn't that bother you in the slightest
Are you happy spending thousands of pounds a year on driving
>Yes you can, but it comes at severe penalties
Space in cities is limited
Cars take up a lot of space
It makes sense that they don't get that space donated for free
Should we instead aim to be more like the US where everyone drives
Not exactly a society where the middle class is thriving because of all the cars
Driving costs a fuck ton even without taxes
Taxing it ensures that people use different modes of transit which are far cheaper than everyone moving around in a 2 ton block of metal
>It's not fair to punish people for just going from A to B
But it's fair to punish people in the cities for living there by swamping them with cars
Their fault for living there, they should just move
>especially when the government already gets so much tax from motorists already
I've already shown you a study that shows that the Danish government spends more money than it earns on drivers while it earns money from cyclists
You deny that by purely looking at road costs while ignoring for example the economic downsides of congestion which costs our economies significant amounts of money
Healthcare costs, ignored
Driver injuries and fatalities, ignored
If you keep peddling:"the government makes money" from drivers without showing a source that accounts for all factors, I can't take your argument seriously, sorry
> If the public transport is good enough, people will choose it over driving
Do you have a source on that
I don't know a single city that isn't congested and where driving is cheap where people use public transit a lot
> Taxing people to death is just not the right thing to do for encouraging change
Why not
Clearly Denmark and The Netherlands show it works
>The government can profit from both of these and they don't have to compete
I'm sorry, but have you been to historic European cities
Where exactly are you going to make space for both a lot of cars and cyclists/pedestrians
London and Paris have tried to make space for just cars, their traffic is working fine

The issue might very well be the way you count unemployed people
In Portugal, official unemployment is highly regulated, you need to have been working for years prior to your unemployment, and has a deadline (shorter when younger)
Many people finish official unemployment without a job, many that have never had one cannot claim unemployment, and I have a strong suspicion this is what is driving the numbers down
usually, percentage is on a 100 scale
I bet it's just one word in German
would those numbers make any sense otherwise
In Belgium, we take it one step further and invite all 7 (Dutch) parties to television shows, but never the right wing

The Good Friday agreement is an agreement between the UK and Ireland that the republic of Ireland will always have open borders with Northern Ireland(UK)
Now because the UK is leaving this means that there needs to be a border to prevent what you described(in both directions, we don't want UK goods, possible(but not realistically) worse quality than EU regulations getting into the EU)
The UK wanted no border between the 2 Irelands but stop freedom of movement between the UK and the EU
EU said "fine, figure it out
" 2 years ago
Now 2 years later they still want the same and want to reopen negotiations
Given the majority of British people want to remain, but the majority of parliament does not
I don't blame the British people, but your line of reasoning does lead to that

Coming back on a decision is not making a joke out of the political system

Elections are never stood by
That's why we keep having them
Same goes for referenda in countries with a more experience with them
When a second vote is held, to deny the public one of the options, would be making a joke out of democracy
It is no different than systems where only government approved candidates can be put on the list
The British government did do just that though
They held a snap election
It's well within the government's power and responsibility to call for a new referendum when one is desired, just like with elections, especially snap elections

Is that one of the reasons for the Years of Lead ?
Still a lot of cunts overpaid in Brussels /strassbourg doing fuck all, not forgetting the transportation costs

So, so, so much more responsive
I hate my electric stove
The stove itself has more thermal mass than a fucking boulder
Takes forever to get up to temperature, takes forever to cool down, and the so-called "power adjustment" is just PWM with a 30 second cycle
Meaning you must always think 5 minutes ahead to get the right temperature for cooking something
You'll be making crêpes, everything is fine for 5 of them then the next one comes out all charred because you had set it to 8 instead of 7 ten minutes earlier
Gas meanwhile gets your pan to temperature in just a few seconds, and when you turn it off the pan also cools down immediately
You also have much better visual feedback (seeing the flames vs figuring out through experience that "7" is actually half power)
Yeah I'm not sure it really matters since ovens can be pre-heated
Never used a gas oven, but it probably comes down to installation & running costs (since gas is usually much cheaper than electricity per Joule)
Yes, except for in the geographical sense
As in Armenia is geographical in Asia

You can take a bike tour of the roads where I live
very interesting
It's all fun and games until you end up in the wrong Valentia
I don't get how you'd become a police officer under such an authoritarian regime tho
it's the police because it's an heritage of the USSR, in theory there should be no need for a police which would be the instrument of the state to oppress the workers so they are supposed to be militia of workers, again that's the theory and I think that you can easily see the limit of it
So basically like in Ukraine where in the end it was only Berkut left ?
To add to that: Tikhanovskaya promised to free the political prisoners and organise elections in six months
So her intent isn't even to be president, but a desperate move for change as you said
That's with the tunnel with a hairpin right
As someone who loves uphill cycling, this looks like a dream to me
I'm loling at all the people being scared of this road, this is literally one of the most fun road you can do in your life
If you like hairpins in tunnels, check out the Passe Di San Boldo (San Boldo Pass) in Italy
Luckily you can put your car on a ferry
Actually, no
Flanders is notorious for those hills, but I'm too much of a lightweight, so I have pretty bad control over my bike on cobbles
Those roads are made for the heavier, powerful type of cyclists

LIST OF BEST BELGIAN BEERS:
CORNET
DUVEL
TRIPLE D'ANVERS
WESTMALLE
LA CHOUFFE
CHIMAY
ORVAL
OMER
BRUGSE ZOT
LEFFE
BEST beer ------> CARA PILS !
Proud of my city
The price was raised from 3 to 4 belgian francs
A whopping 33% increase and worth to fight for with a student budget
A similar increase on a €2 beer would raise the price all at once to €2,67
imagine the riots
*gets angry*
*Thinks about all the free beer as ransom*
Best beer should be cheap beer
Imma come to your country
Is that the newest account
Thank you
BEST BEER OF BELGIUM IS CORNET BEER
Hahahaha altijd
I'm very sorry but you really need to up your knowledge of our own beers if you put Leffe, Cornet, Duvel, La Chouffe, Omer, Brugse Zot and Triple D'Anvers in a top 10 of Belgian Beers
Really
Always hating on us huh
Please leave us alone :'(
Yeah it's europe so checks out haha
Probably
Maybe
Nah
100% sure
Geef Dries geen extra ideeen aub :)
this is the cara way
This is debatable, but you have chosen a fine specimen if I may say so
So that's what we're doing today, are we
We're going to fight
Most of the locally produced (BENELUX) beers share the same name or have names that get mixed up really quick
La Trappe is the only dutch beer worth drinking
You won't regret it ;)

Why the hell are they using [PragerU] as a source
edit: Seems like they took that part of the site down
[Archived version here]
> The point is that capitalism is a flexible enough framework that is able to include "socialist" policies
Is it really fair to say the framework is capitalism ? To me it looks like social democracy is the actual framework that makes these countries so successful
It's a bit easy to attribute their success to capitalism when the reason the citizens of these countries have such good quality of life is because of heavy market manipulation, consumer protection and income redistribution
Any economic system has that flexibility
As you said these countries implement socialist policies, so we can also say that socialism has the flexibility to be used within a world where private property is the norm
My point is, as long as you have a healthy democracy and accessible education, you'll probably end up with a mix of capitalist and socialist policies, because both have pros and cons
Pick and choose what you need from both systems, and you'll obtain the best results
Most of the world is dominated by capitalism so you can't reasonably make the assumption that capitalism is the reason we have democracy
You might as well say oxygen is all around us and therefore we have democracy thanks to oxygen (which I guess is kinda true as we wouldn't exist without it but
You get the point)
Correlation does not mean causation
Edit: And there are plenty of capitalist countries with barely functioning governments and huge inequalities
Okay ?
My point still stands
Also, this statement of yours has not aged well :p

I disagree on number 1

The USA is not a standard to follow or a metric to compare ourselves with
I mean, pretty much every major city had MASSIVE protests up until a week or so ago
That ain't a coincidence
They are mentioning the relationship between protests and covid alright
Just not how you'd expect
[Black Lives Matter protests haven't led to COVID-19 spikes
It may be due to people staying home
[black lives matter protests may have slowed overall spread of coronavirus in Denver and other cities, new study finds]
> But a new study by a nationwide research team that includes a University of Colorado Denver professor has found something surprising: The protests may have slowed the overall spread of the coronavirus in cities with large demonstrations, including Denver
Which is quite the
interesting take
I mean, just do a google search and you'll get the idea
All partisan papers are essentially absolving the protests/riots from spreading covid, while the neutral and most European sources view it critically (except for the guardian obviously)
Covid is not a topic about health in the US, it's all politics
One day it's an existential danger, the next it's no biggie
Just depends on what's politically favorable at the moment
>not even daring to mention the effect that the protests and the massive crowd gatherings may have had to this
I think it had a hidden impact people aren't recognizing
The protests themselves will have spread the disease a little but it's likely quite limited
What isn't limited though it that it completely wrecked the social pressure to take corona serious
It takes a lot to convince people to quarantine and the social blind eye that was turned to the protest probably did a lot of damage to the legitimacy of covid as a threat
The populace seems to have given up much faster in the US (Republic and Democrat states alike) than in Europe
So why didn't it work in California
It is turned into an RvsD issue online but some Democrat states seem to do pretty terrible as well
What could Trump practically do against the dozens of mass large scale protests in every major city though
I can't seem to find the article
but essentially the only protest related covid data we have is from law enforcement involved with the protesters
Increased testing would certainly be desirable
With protests of thousands of people there's likely infected among them
Shouting, chanting and yelling reduces the mask effectiveness
I'm not convinced general hygiene is closely observed
It would be great if the protests/riots didn't increase the spread - enough people died even without corona - though that seems to wishful thinking
At best it didn't cause a massive spread
All true
I was highlighting how the media reports it specifically
As you pointed out, the trump rally was condemned, but thousands of people protesting are not
It's all partisan at this point
Republicans generally don't seem to be much aware of the risks or willing to ignore them across the board
The left and the democrats are quite selective with when they take it seriously
Wait, Finland exists
That's rather ironic of them to have it taken down for being racist against ethnic Mongolians when China is doing its best to wipe out their nomadic culture

Availability of Google Street view in Europe
I think it's a bummer for Germany and Austria because in the future, it's gonna be really cool to see how streets evolved over the decades using Google Maps
They won't be able to do that
Germany won’t let google on the autobahn
also when google was going to go roll it out you had people getting enthusiastic for the wrong reason, like a police chief saying they would no longer need to patrol as he thought it was a live feed
I read somewhere that Germany and Austria are like this because of some security/privacy law, so sometimes the places also are blurred
meanwhile it took Belgium years of suing and threats to get Google to blur out military bases and I think they still refuse to blur the nucleair power plants
A bunch of Germans on reddit threads like these
Belgium seems to be in between most hate debt exept for a house and a car credit cards ar used but debid cards are stadard as you get one for free with most accounts and every shop that accepts electronic payment accepts them there is now even a debid app for phone payments and exchanging money with people without using cash, most people I know only have credit cards for some foreign eshops (to most accept bakontact now, our debid network) and for hotels and countries where you can't use maestro (standard free on our debid cards and runs on the mastercard network)
Germany has more local speed limits though, I think we drove whatever we wanted to about 1/4 of the time and the other 3/4 was a mix of anywhere between 110-140
N°1 should be the fact that they don't have highways at all
Love me some one-way tunnels with two-way traffic too
> and the farmer gets to set the price
You're saying there's a business case for me moving to Iceland, dress like a farmer, hide next to a motorway, and throw sheep in front of cars
Indeed
Back in 2014 I did a complete tour of the ring road, and it only contained a couple of kilometres of gravel
On these gravel parts, the speed limit is 80 km/h.
I think the proper explanation is that Iceland does not actually have highways of the common type
Even the ring road is 2 lanes (one lane in each direction); the type of road that has a speed limit of 90 or 100 in most of continental Europe
It's the ring *road*. Iceland doesn't have highways
I lived there
It's called the ring *road*, not the ring *highway*. And actually you're right that they do, I forgot about the multiple lane motorways around Reykjavik, so my bad for that
But the ring road is a one lane road with no separation in the middle
[It looks like this] I don't see how you could call that a highway
[Tell me this looks like a highway to you
> There are motorways with multiple separated lanes for each direction in the Reykjavik area
That's true and I stand corrected
I lived there yet somehow I only focused my mind on the ring road here
As for the rest of the ring road being a highway you'd have to admit that's not the type of road people will have in mind when they think of the term "highway" right
And regarding this map it is in my opinon highly relevant to mention that since it is linked with speed limits, it would be mad to have a 140kmh limit on the Icelandic Ring Road because it ressembles a normal road, not what people generally refer to as *highways*.

I don't think Andorra would be considered a microstate if it weren't for the fact that almost its entire population lives in three valleys, and the rest of the country is basically uninhabited mountain terrain
Its actual inhabitable area is probably about the same as that of San Marino

I feel like Scots right now have the most amount of reasons to be in favor of independence they’ll ever have:

That's like Maryland voting on whether Virginia could secede

England didn't vote on it
I didn't know historically countries had to be nice to each other out of principle
Again, even if Wallonia were against it they represent less than 40% of the country, and really
Sea access is your issue here
Wallonia has never historically had sea access, should we just cut them a corridor to Zeebrugge or Antwerp and make them free cities
I'm heavily anti-Flemish independence too, but what you're asking is the equivalent of having England vote in Scotland's indyref

That's like saying the white house is a monument to slavery
Yes, the Antwerp central station was built with his money, but there aren't any overt references to him
The reason why the station remains is because it's a functional and beautiful building that serves a distinct purpose in society, not to glorify Leopold II
Statues however, don't serve any purpose other than to glorify people, which we shouldn't do with Leopold II
That's the difference

No, the only reference to Leopold in the entire building is that "II" is carved in a handful of arches
Nothing that a normal person would actually realise refers to Leopold, and they're not even noticeable in the first place
I actually had to google it to find where these initials are
Also I wouldn't mind if we chipped them off either way, there's better symbols than "II" to replace them with

Here in Belgium, lootboxes have been banned for a couple of years now
They fall under the gambling law, as they involve real-life money
The law does state an exception for "physical card and board games" which is how Pokémon cards, Yu Gi Oh cards etc can still be sold
A digital card game cannot use this loophole, because their lootboxes don't contain physical playing cards
[According to this Dutch site that I just googled] the Netherlands have a similar exception in their law
This site says "it's true that card games like Pokémon, Magic the Gathering and Yu Gi Oh do fall under the gambling law, however an exception has been made for card- and board games
This is because when the consumer opens a Pokémon Booster Pack, he always knows that there will be Pokémon trading cards in the package, even if it might not be the ones he was hoping for
" Which is a bit of a weird explanation if you ask me
>"he always knows that there will be Pokémon trading cards in the package, even if it might not be the ones he was hoping for
not correct, it's because in pokemon trading cards there is a key available that says how much percent chance you have to draw X card, these are odds that EA for example does not wish to disclose since that means they can't tweak these odds anymore
It is
Hmm, I kind of hope Belgium doesn't follow that decision
I *loved* Yu Gi Oh cards as a kid
Well I was just quoting the source I linked, but your explanation does make more sense
Maybe that used to be the case
but isn't that where gatcha came from
instead of buying lootboxes you buy keys for a lootbox, which means you always get what you paid for

All true except for "please think about that some more". I definitely understand that as "bad idea".
I’m a Dutch speaking Belgian, but most of this is obvious
But I think we are culturally closer to the English than the Dutch for some reason
This kind of depends which Dutch speakers you mean
Flemish people would be more inclined towards the Anglophone explanation while for Dutch people this might be more correct
Belgium confirms
Isn't that what everyone understands from those statements
TIL I've always used "correct me if I'm wrong" incorrectly haha
I use it to convey where I'm not really 100% sure of what I'm saying, but it is not like I'm completely unsure
More like, "this is what I currently think, and I'm relatively sure it's right with what I currently know, but if you think that's not completely right, do not hesitate to let me know"
"That's not bad" is also used to convey "that's quite good" in Dutch though, at least in Belgium, so that one kind seems like the odd one out
(and is a very common thing to say)
Out of the rest, I think I'd only interpret "you must come for dinner sometime" somewhat literally
"That's interesting", more notably if followed by a question on to the same topic, I could also interpret literally, depending on the context
The rest is rather obvious
Also, is this list not more typical for UK English rather than the USA
First one is correct for sure, it's very awkward
I'm a Belgian Dutch speaker
And I must say we pretty much use the English way of communication
If we meet, we ask "Hoe is het
" (How are you
), and expect a simple answer like "Goed, en jij
" (Good, and you
Same with the other sentences on how to convince the other person he should rework or reconsider something
This often causes issues when communicating with Dutch Dutch speakers
As I worked quite a bit with Dutch people now, I've also become a more direct, and quite often, I will be bluntly clear what I mean
Certainly in my professional life
I've seen many people, when they are asked to do something they don't like or they don't believe it will work, they will avoid the question and say something like "I will consider that". But never actually come back to it
While I try to communicate in a Dutch style and say "I won't do it for X and Y reason", after which they can try to convince me again
There's a discrepancy between Dutch speakers and Dutchmen
In Flanders we speak Dutch, but we would interpret it more like the Anglophones
I’m not Dutch but my culture is (from my Dad), and my girlfriend too, and yes that’s basically it, especially when we ask « how are you », you imply to take news about how was your situation since the last time we met
Yes
I dont identify with any of this and it all seems quite random
But I guess thats not an exciting answer

So remaining large countries like Germany (-24%), France (-14%), Spain (+14%, yes plus) will have to somehow get to an average of -40% in 15 years , which isn't going to happen
Don't count on my own country like Belgium to contribute anything, even though they will sign every single treaty known to man

Don't hesitate to call your general practitioner if you're feeling more serious symptoms

Gosh, I want to visit Slovenia for the past 4 years, finally decided to go this year

Damn it
Such a lovely country
I will for sure
I still have erasmus friends there so hopefully soon
> Because we could use our own currency, make our products cheaper (devaluating our currency against the euro), selling more, that would lead to hiring more people in order to be able to produce everything needed, therefore we wouldn't have 25% unemployment rate
Just to name one
You wouldn't have more export to the EU
If you devaluate your currency too much they'll just put import tariffs on the borders with the EU
In the end you'd just make your country poorer
You'd also pay much higher interest rates on your debt compared to today
You'd therefore not be able to take on so much debt to restart and build a solid economy
There is a reason why a lot of countries with weak currencies face bankruptcy even though their debt levels are really low
People advocating those kind of measures seem to forget they don't evolve in a vacuum

Question for Finns: do you generally agree with this kind of division
I've lived in FI for 2
5 and never have I heard my country (BE) being referred to as "Western Europe". It was always "Middle Europe", which I interpreted as a latitude slicing (vs the usual longitude East/West) because "Finland is in the East but not an Eastern Europe country
Please chime in
What is this shit
It's all about that sweet Luxemburgian oil
It's insane that Belgian political taboo's are followed outside of Belgium
There is a hard border between Flanders and Walloonia
Lately it's more and more often recognized that we plain and simple are 2 democracies living together
Except that our institutional framework doesn't fully represent that reality yet
Hence world record breaking election gridlocks
Over and over again
The current govenement just doubles down on it and is determined to stick together and ignore everything, as long as they all agree on ignoring the problem that is our disfunctional system
My gf is Slovene and loves showing me around whenever I go over to visit, can confirm it’s breathtaking
Actually the last government in Holland was partly supported by extreme right wing party PVV, the party of Geert Wilders, an absolutely terrifying man
It looks like a 39 year old balding man with a very long neck screaming at his employees
Oh no
That is impossible, the speed required to do that would vaporise you by friction with the air
It's not the friction that causes the heating, it's compression
You're moving so fast through a gas that the gas can't get out of the way fast enough
It is compressed
Compressed gas heats up
The heat weakens the structured and drag finishes it off
I, and i cant stress this enough, must thank you because couldnt find this sub
Ooohhhh that would be cool
Do let me know if that ever happens please
No it s really genuine :// i wanted to delete cause  after rereading it, I thought people would misunderstand my intention
Im glad that no one did
Beats me
That would suck :(
Jesus all this sub can do anymore is moan about Brexit bad, reeeeeeee Conservative bad Labour good, EU absolutely no flaws at all
EU good
Honestly if you hear how South Korea has been reacting and what measures they have taken that chart looks quite realistic
Belgium and brewery
Should we have expected something else ?
The Affligem Brewery is kind of wrong
Yes monks have been brewing beer for a long time, but can you consider that a business
Not true for Belgium, 1074 is when the Abbey of Afflighem was founded, not the brewery
Some sourpusses reject any sort of change, but I think this is wonderful
More space for people and business without cluttering up the skyline, conservation of historic landmarks, added mobility, looks even greener than before, and I get that the 'pipe' might be divisive, but I'm always a fan of public art
Visited Vilnius 10 years ago, this really make me want to go back there
That's really surprising to hear
Nearly all our cities (Belgium) are built around rivers, I just kind of assumed that was the case for pretty much any historic European settlement
Completely subjective, but I kind of prefer London's mish mash jumble over Paris' "old stays here, new goes there" :) My hometown of Ghent, Belgium, imo does a marvelous job adding ultra modern while respecting existing heritage
Great to hear Vilnius is keeping enough breathing room
Livable urban planning is all too often traded in for more real estate income, which ironically leads to less valuable property smh
Oof, we used to pave over rivers in the 60's and 70's and now we're undoing all of it
La Défense is cool, but because it's so removed from the historic center and it's almost only businesses, it turns into a ghost town after business hours (that's what I remember from a decade ago, it might have changed for the better)
Completely agree on the random highrise
Any architecture that doesn't take its surroundings into account is failed imo
Who knows, by then we might have either holo-rivers, or toxic sludge streams
This is starting to look like 2015 all over again
I'm fearful that Brussels, London and other cities outside of France might be following soon
So I guess Belgium became the Netherlands when we took in all their refugees
You should put the french flag on Corsica, they will hate that ;)
Belgium should be French rather than Dutch, because all those pesky Americans still fucking believe that fries came from France
***TRIGGERED***
Belgium is the Netherlands
We fucking hate them, kicked their asses out off our country and founded our own state
What's wrong with you
How did this stuff even went up
It's not even funny :p.
It would be a compliment in all non-Scandinavian countries
As a Fleming, I welcome the Dutch Annexation
As a Belgian, WTF
You mean Macedonia ? /s
Nah, we built a wall to keep the Dutchies out (we named it ProperDeltaWorks), and then put their flag on it while we taunted them with bitterballs and frikandels, and watched them pedal their bikes aimlessly through the rising water
Spanish guys
I mean, the flag kinda took over all of Spain
You guys are just beneath the water level
IT'S WHAT WE DO BEST AND THEY STOLE IT FROM US
*cries*
I agree
We're now under Dutch command
That would be awesome
+I'm now living in a coastal town
Traitor
Too much Polandball
Me too
I feel bad for the people from Baarle-Hertog though
I wonder if they sunk too, or if they managed to become islands
I know of the historical context, but even that is slightly contested
See, you say they found them in Northern France, but the version I've been taught was that they found them in Belgium, but mistook the people for French, because of the language and all
Yeah I don't *actually* believe they *stole* them
It's just a running joke y'know
While this man is giving the speech of his life, Guy Verhofstadt is just casually checking his phone
I love being from Belgium
To be fair, it'd take a lot to impress Verhofstad with a speech

Please keep discussion civil and have a nice day
Good to see that post-truth isn't always succesfull
The president can dissolve the government, which Hofer suggested he'd do
It's because that VdB won that it is indeed a symbolic victory
Something wrong
I'm not too familiar with the Austrian papers & such
> Then a new general election would be held, and imagine how THAT would turn out for the FPÖ if they pull that shit
Very positive considering they're leading in the polls
The people who voted for Hofer largely did so because they're not content with the current politics, they want change
Hofer could give them that chance by dissolving the council, and voting out the current government parties
The people who voted for Van der Bellen wouldn't vote FPÖ anyway, so they can't "punish" FPÖ for pulling that trick
Damn
didn't see you embolding it on mobile
I thought that the name was weird but found it in an /r/austria thread about Austrian news sources
I'll take it out
To be fair, Peil overestimates PVV
Meanwhile in Belgium most people only have credit cards for going on holiday and when it comes to card and mobile debid is king
Well this is a complete shit show
Now make a Games of Throne tv show with them !
Elisabeth has a few younger brothers but she's the oldest child

Goddamnit I love Utrecht, lived there half a year
Absolutely lovely town
Can you link a source to your PS
Haven't heard that anywhere else
Thanks
You can only vote to one party and give a preferential vote for one candidate in that party
Each party gain an amount of MPs proportional to the national votes and the preferential votes serves to gives the job to candidates that are well loved even if there party wouldn't have chose them initially
We have more or less the same in Belgium except we can vote for multiple candidates in the same party if we want or just vote for the party without caring of the candidates
No sentence for Belgium, well that's annoying
Oh fuck
You forgot Belgium: every type of beer can be put in every type of glass
This map would implie that it is impossible to piss off a Belgian, while that is in fact VERY easy
That's right
Belgians don't get pissed
Belgium: "french fries are invented by the French"
Belgium left out AND mentioned in the Swiss line
I see what you did there
I'm not irritated :)
Guys
guys
You know belgium is a country#
JFQDLKJQSLKFDJLKSQJFDLKJQSFD
To add: 'French fries
' for Belgium
For Belgium: "I love Belgian-style beers
That's a thing in America
American beers that are brewed loosely the way Belgian beers are brewed, and are then marketed as "Belgian-style".
Someone once told me that the best Belgian beer is Blue Moon
I was like, that isn't even a Belgian beer you piece of shit
Holy shit
My blood pressure went up just by reading that
And that's even considering that Belgium isn't on the map
I wonder what it'd be for Belgium anyways
Belgium too, for us it would be something like "french fries are invented by the French"
Same feeling my friend, same feeling
Same for Belgium
*Shots fired*
I don't like wine, but the first time I saw somebody ask for an ice cube in their wine in a movie I was "this is a joke right
being left out is 10 times better than any other shit they could say about us though
Deep down you know it's true ;)
Really
Dude, it's just chocolate
I'm not even that gung-ho about it
Now ***BEER*** on the other hand
Oh snap
That's how you trigger the Flemish part :)
No, the real question is : "Is it racist when our culture has no negative  connotation towards *blackface*"
answer is no, cause in order to be racist, it needs to be about a race in some way, and black pete isn't about race

The Beauty of ethnical nationalism
You know, that has absolutely nothing to do with the ABSOLUTE FACT that war was nationalism
I will happily point out the retardedness of nationalism at any time
Btw, We have never been without government
We are a nation, not an anarchy
Over a thousand years old
Yet still superior to the Belgian roads
We will be forgotten soon then
Also Sicily was settled by Greeks before Romans
This is the sort of content that /r/europe is traditionally about
So satisfying
With a Finnish friend,  I can very much agree with this
Wtf is this kokko kukku mei language
I’mma send her this to annoy her
Given how divided Belgium is (seperate educational systems and separate media)
I would love to see the numbers for the different regions
So Manuel from Barcelona was right after all
But such a big difference with Portugal
Why
Odd to see Belgium not divided between the communities, I'm sure there are some disparities
What number would be considered "decent" in this index
I've got the feeling that Belgium is speaking English better than the Germans
-A Belgian living in German
Not at all surprised by Spain
I used to work in a big train station and EVERY SINGLE Spanish person that came up to me would just assume that Belgians know Spanish
We don't If you want to talk to me it's either gonna be English, Dutch or broken French
\> assuming we have just two educational systems
[haha cute]
Not gonna lie, probably yeah, still love you guys though
Lol
Oh you silly Walloon
No, the Dutch are definitely better than us in English
But only in terms of grammar and spelling though
Their speech is often horrible
When I hear French people talk English it always reminds me of Gladys from the movie Les Profs
A testament to how well they keep everything renovated too
What effect would this have on the ecosystems of fish and plants
It would kill all trade in Europe
The most important ports are located inside the closed sea
Imagine all that traffic having to go through locks
Build the wall
Drain the sea
If it makes a road from the UK to France (like Neeltje Jans), it is finally connect the UK to the continent, and allow them to feel more european
Too bad they left the EU
Why don't they connect dover to the French caps near Calais
Nothing will flow over those cliffs, and it would protect holland just as well
I see what they're doing ! they're gonna build up water levels in the North Sea to flood Flanders ! the bastards !
Wouldn't this dam become a major problem in armed conflict
Blow the dam and you may wipe out large swathes of territory
Would make us sort of vulnerable no
Compared to just local dams where needed
Hmm
Could we consider tricking the Mexicans into paying for it
Since they're already funding America's walls and all that
and it will cost more than to actually fight climate change
You know the Dutch Ijsselmeer, full of fresh water, used to be a salt water sea, right
OTOH, lowering the water a few meter and building the polder on dry land before raising back the sea level would be awesome
Yeah you don't understand anything about engineering then
It's several orders of magnitudes outside what's feasible
I wasn't considering unlimited money indeed

No need for politics on this happy day
He didn't have much choice seeing as they were behind 2 goals lmao
Hahaha imo German is like an angry Dutch
But I can see the drunk thing hahahah
Hahaha zalig
Ik kijk normaal wel als België speelt maar deze match was zo anders dan de rest haha
Dit ging om de eer ofzo
Belgium have a fucking great goalkeeper, thanks to Courtois
Ik ben een zij haha, maar voetbalmatch wordt wel vaker gezegd hier hoor
SANCTIONS
NOW
I know there are already sanctions
But more
*Qu’on me donne six lignes écrites de la main du plus honnête homme, j’y trouverai de quoi le faire pendre
Which translates to "**If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him
**"
Attributed (but disputed) to Cardinal Richelieu during the reign of Louis XIII of France
you jelly of our place under the sun aye
True, except don't make this personal like you just did
He nor anyone else should bear responsibility for what people 5 generations ago did
chill man, was a lighthearted joke
Dont get your lederhosen in a twist
Can you name 1 interbellum german colony please
Educate me
I also never cut off any hands by the way, but nice try referencing horrors commited in the congo by belgians over half a century ago
&#x200B;
edit: do you even know who and what i referenced with that "place under the sun"? I suggest you google it
Fully agree with you that nobody should be held accountable for what people 5 generations ago did
Not even family members
And imho, not even governments
We and you
Not they and them
You were talking about yourself and him, no one else
If you didn't intend to do that, then you used the wrong words
To my knowledge, all german colonies were lost after WW1, including namibia
That's why i said interbellum, which literaly means "between wars" (i.e. 1918-1939)
But yes, I mostly agree with you that the populace of today has absolutely nothing to do with the horrors of the past and should not be held accountable
But i think i differ with you in that sense that i also think the government should not take responsibility
Because with taking resposibility and admitting guilt, come inevetible monetary claims
Which are eventually paid by the populace of today, which again, i firmly believe should not be punished for crimes commited 5 generations ago
And not to mitigate any wrongdoings, but i also think actions should be judged in the spirit of that time
What i mean with that is that for example slavery was a very normal thing in the 1800s, and nobody thought any ill of it
Today, it is absolutely unthinkable and despicable in the west
Same about having colonies
I DO think that governments should RECOGNIZE and remember the wrongdoings of the past however
And while Congo indeed was a private property of the king, at least when the atrocities were commited, it would be hypocritical to day the belgian people were innocent w.r.t. the barbarism involved
&#x200B;
Finally, the "place in the sun" i reference was uttered by  [Bernhard von Bülow] (indeed during wilhelm's reign) as a "kick-off" to Germany's contemporary colonilization, since it had little (or none even
not sure) at that time, while all other european powers were conquering more and more
&#x200B;

Story is actually very popular in Japan
Most Belgians don't even know about it
His only companion was a snake
In all seriousness, I love how the stones form the blanket, absolute work of art
Isn't this from a suske & wiske strip
19th century
In the story he did
He even won a student grant with it to go study at an art academy, but he died before he got to hear the good news
The style of statue caused a bit of a stir when it was revealed
Because, basically a big reason they made this one was to draw Japanese tourists, but apparently many Japanese tourists were rather unimpressed by it, because they expected either a lifelike statue or a statue in the style of the anime
I remember the local new doing a story on it back when
There is actually a statue in Hoboken that draws a lot of Japanese tourists, even though he actually died in the cathedral of Antwerp
Especially popular in the US and Japan, but that's it indeed
In the 80s Belgian/Antwerp tourist offices jumped on it
And it's one of the most convenient things we don't appreciate enough
Those EU funds are ment to go into YOUR pockets, not Babis’.

Renewable isn’t sustainable
We’ll need nuclear too
But by all means get rid of coal and gas
While other parts of the country are seriously considering building new coal plants
* cheaper air travel ain't a good thing ... it's cool you can do those city trips at a drop of a hat but they come with a huge carbon footprint attached to them
* single market competition hasn't brought nothing but decay of railways, disinvestment in nuclear power and left us with no GAFAs ... it sank our nokia, siemens, Erickson, Thomson, Alcatel, ... we pay more for our electricity and water while having to buy american, chinese, or Korean appliances, computers, and smartphones
* enhanced social welfare such as what ? Posted Workers ? delayed retirement age ?
* 48 hours without overtime ? What a joke
The median worked hours across Europe are in the vicinity of 28 hours ... 40 hours only if you consider  the full time employment
* the EU let deliberately more people drown in the Mediterranean sea than Trump and all his predecessors let people drown or die while trying to cross the Rio Grande or the deadly Arizona desert
*  the number of flights increased
This is not a good thing regarding our climate issues no matter how you spin it
* seriously
The EU so called free and fair competition principles destroyed our high tech champions while other countries protected and developed their own
It took the same time to the Chinese and Russians to develop their own GAFA it took to us to destroy ours
The f&f competition promised to lower our bills, they raised
It's a failed policy that made of our continent a tech desert
* Delayed retirement age is a political choice not a law of nature
Most people retire a decade earlier, either because they can't find a job in their 50s or they are washed out
Delayed retirement age translates not in people working longer but in poorer pensioners
* bragging about something that leaves most behind is ridiculous
Overtime should be banned with a few exceptions
A 30 hours work week would solve most of our employment issues
* [You tell me]
which one did they break exactly
A popup window to chose which browser i want to use in Windows ~~20y~~ 10y ago and now soon in Android is not "breaking up monopolies".  Seems like a reach
I heard you the first time
Other people doing it is a weird flex, it's still a huge step backward not forward
It's not the single or unified market that's preventing Europeans to develop their own tech giants
It's the rule of free and uncompromised competition laws that prevent us to state fund our tech companies and turn them into global giants
We had hundreds of tech companies in the turn of the millenium
Multuple competitors to Amazon, google, and the like
An Airbus, an Ariane wouldn't be possible in todays Europe
China, while having the GDP of Germany, banned the american companies and developed its own
Russia, while having the GDP of Spain, developped its own (not sure if you can have google, twitter and facebook in Russia ... probably but they have their own)
Life expectancy is declining in the UK and the US ... Mostly because of drug abuse and economic issues
GDP has been multiplied by four for the same period
We're rich enough to not die at work
what impact ? France were better off when they worked 35 hours, employment boomed then
5 % is surprisingly high
[So I checked ...] It's doesn't include unemployed people, pre-pensioners, people in between jobs, self employed, people who dropped out of statistics and it doesn't reflect EU disparity rates
Part time employment rates:
Netherlands 46
8% Austria 27
6 Germany 26
8 Bulgaria 1
8 ... What does that even mean ? How can those numbers be so different
It shows that the EU modified its rescue policy to let knowingly thousands die at sea
sure they issued a fine and the only thing that changed is you will get a browser choice popup, way to stick to google bois
and manufacturers have to pay to have the privilege of using Chrome, surely that will change everything
a fine doesn't break up a monopoly it's the cost of doing business

This is great news, particularly the adoption part; too many kids not having parents, and couples wishing they could have kids
I really can't stand the idea of kids being raised "by the system" instead of in a loving family (whatever the composition)
Well done Finland, well done
Well, we don't know 100% for sure but a leading theory that we are quite sure about is that in nature people were born gay to serve as "guard dogs" to stay up at night protecting other people since they didn't have the standard I go hunt and then come home to my woman mentality
In modern times this isn't needed ofcourse but ym point is that people are born gay, and the ratio of gay to straight people is very much in favour of straight people
Don't worry about the planet turning gay since you don't just turn gay and more people are born straight than gay
In terms of reproduction, adoption is the obvious one
It's hard and can be expensive so that sucks and I hope that changes in the future (the money part not the hard part) and lets say for some reason everyone becomes a flaming homosexual then people would still have sex they just wouldnt enjoy it as much or at all
Anyway people shouldn't see being gay as this whole new way of living and some mystical creature

Walloon politicians listen to France so many times, why don't they do it now
Nice to see one of our neighbours has some sense
I'm pretty sure this has fuck all to do with France thinking nuclear is the way forward but with ENGIE (former Gas de France - Suez) pushing this so they can get their hands on even more countries' power supply
Same in Belgium
> First of all Nuclear is not renewable
It involves mining for uranium
Which there is no shortage of for a long time, especially irrelevant considering the critical moment is right now and not what to do in 500 years
>Currently the US is storing 90000 tonnes of Nuclear waste
I'm actually amazed it is that little
Imagine how much more co2 a zero-nuclear USA would have dumped into the atmosphere if we were actually worried about that neglible amount
That's roughly 50000 average weight US cars
>Finally if it goes wrong its catastrophic
Climate change going wrong however isn't an "if". Let's deal with that first before worrying about triple lottery winnings
Seriously, what matters is how much people will *likely* die because of something
We don't refuse to build dams because something could go wrong and we realize demonizing hydro energy over it is counter productive
We don't refuse to build solar because some people will die during maintenance/construction/placement (solar performs worse than nuclear when measuring deaths/kwh)
Especially shutting down functioning already built reactors because of political pressure is downright stupid
I don't know
It looks like the WiFi would suck
They may define themselves as irreligious in Belgium, but the majority has still been baptized and done their communion “for the presents”.
Hard to belive the Hungary numbers, considering they vote for a party dedicated to "preverve Christian values and defend a Christian Europe".
as much as I applaud  this, I really need to know the sample size of a chart that says the UK (and several others) have 0% non-christian religion
(also, Belgian here, thinking we got plenty more than 60% atheists among 16-29 year olds) ...smells fishy
I don't think it's just Christianity, it's religion in general

Hyperlinks do not count regarding article 13, since the law explicitly says users must upload the content
Hyperlinks do not count regarding article 11 because it explicitly says it does not concern itself with hyperlinks and shall not have any effects on them

Article 11 concerns itself with copies or summaries of press articles

As such, the conclusion this applied to hyperlinks was absurd anyway

Belgian crisis finally solved, thanks OP
Came here to coment the same thing
Porra
Just to add to your comment 'Porra' is is more like damn and 'foda-se' is fuck
Das kut hé?
Lmfao at "kut" though
Who do they think we are Dutch
I think it was the Dutch doing their colonisation thing again,  because no Flemish person says "kut"
I wouldn’t mind this as long as we get coffee shops
It sure was if you're French
Now give us back Frans-Vlaanderen
While 'foda-se' can also be used with that meaning, in terms of semantics the translation in the comment above is more accurate, but tbh they are kind of interchangeable depending on the on the situation and the feeling you want to convey
Calm down there EU-Florida
Let's fuse the Belgisch Koninkrijk and Koninkrijk der Nederlanden into the Belgisch Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, or the BKN
And while we're at it, let's annex France into the BKN as well and rename it Groot-Wallonië!
But wait, will we have to replace our godverdommes with alsjemenous
Exactly
We get coffee shops and they get us
Your comment unintentionally, or unknowingly, highlights the cause of most of Belgium's problems, as well as a large chunk of its history
Yes
And also, Walloon was much closer to Flemish than to French
In an alternate universe where Belgium formed but with no French occupations before it, we would've likely had just one language

I don't know what purple means and I'm too afraid to ask
Please rescue me from Belgium we are burning at school, with facemask I want to move to norway
This is fine
This is why I'm a bit triggered when anyone say that they're happy that the winter is milder and that spring is summer-like yeah enjoy the fucking actual summer
Purple means death
Yeah no, it used to be below 20°C the average on july and august for my region
Now we're waaaaaaaay over 20°C as average
Crazy how u can say it's "tame" when it's breaking all the temperature records that were established during last summer year
Very tame summer indeed

I am Belgian, and i can say that's  pretty correct
Am i right ?
just wait till we all start posting "winter in country X" pictures
Many countries refer to those as Middle-Eastern rather than Asian
And yet, in many countries people who see the word Asian will think of the Far East rather than the near East
Connotations are a thing

It's a Belgian holiday as well
In fact, Saint Nicolas, commonly called Sinterklaas, is the basis for the character of Santa Claus
I know, but actually the Bulgarian monarchy wanted to take Belgium as a model
when they were in a democratic mood, which was not that frequent
Oh yeah but the joke was to go along and confuse the two so I had to find the common points that I could find

Created by Dan Harmon, critically acclaimed first season, s02 they changed the formula by doing genre parodies, s03 is awesome and has John Goodman, then Dan Harmon got fired, the rest of the writer tried to fill the gap with s04 but failed miserably, Dan Harmon comes back in force, but the series is dropped by NBC at the end of s05, then the series got bought by Yahoo, and let total freedom to Dan Harmon

if America succeeds be sure Europe will follow, it's in our best interest to support america on this
Also the majority of the  most common websites are from the USA so we will feel this
That's why EU makes 'Directives', so every country has some flexibility regarding their own laws
(I did a big shortcut, as I'm no expert in EU laws, regulations and directives)
From Wikipedia:
> Directives normally leave member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted
EDIT: as pointed out, NN is a regulation, not a directive, anyway, my statement stays true for a lot of EU actions
in theory yes, but big ISP's have proven time and time that they're going for malpractices
So regulations to keep them in check would be for the best
It wouldn't have lasted long once the markt was really open and roaming was a thing of the past
You think so
there's already a political party looking into repealing net neutrality in belgium
If it passes in America this goes on the fast lane in Belgium
there is already a political party in belgium that is looking to put this on the agenda, if countries start to look into this, and the US implements this it's only a matter of when the EU follows
While not being that obvious like the US big money is also involved in the EU
Those dinosaurs were all a bunch of meteorophobes anyway

We're civilized people and will always follow the rules of war
One does not simply start a war without invading Poland
It's 52900 square meters per block
Since 1 block is 1 meter tall and the scale is 1:230, one side translates to 230 meters from this minecraft world to real life
230^2 = 52900

In addition to that, will I have to get licenses for each screenshot I have used in my past articles
And will I even be allowed/able to write reviews
I think people should read this
Here are the people who voted for the articles in Belgium
Every national sub should do the same
You can find the MEPs info here  and how they voted here

Also, don't forget to thank another MEP for the support
Most of Conservative and Labour voted in favour though
Big chance that the British government would do the same
Is this law under QMV (probably) in the Council
You could I guess see if there is a large enough coalition of Member States who could block or change it
It's directive, which means every government can implement it at their leisure, which they probably all will because the vote was a landslide
&#x200B;
So unless article 50 makes you personally immune from your own national government as well, it won't do a goddam thing
Lobbying in the EU doesn't quite work like in the US
Since campaigns are financed with public money there isn't really a bribe culture
It mostly has to do with access
Corporate lobbyists are privately funded and have more money and thus more resources to convince decision makers, while public lobbying groups have less resources and thus have a harder time competing with the private industry
RemindMe
6 hours
RemindMe
cause it's just copyright law and it's not even the final vote
And then again it's just a directive, which means every country will have to implement it themselves anyway, it's just a guideline
TL;DR: LibDems, Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and UKIP against, most of Tories and Labour in favour
And if the websites implement it globally, that'll be an excellent push for decentralized networks
As a Belgian, I'll just assume we don't murder anymore
This is the reason why we don't make good police series
Bruh
Had to look up what the Brabant Murders were
It's not known here under that name
Here it's "De bende van Nijvel" (The gang of Nijvel)
In my, an many people's opinion: extreme right branch of our federal police that wanted a police state/extreme right government and extended policing power
Or maybe really just worlds worst gangsters
Weird case, still very much talked about here
Hope to one day find out what happened and who was behind it
Pedophile scandals, I guess you mean Dutroux and his gang
Terrible case, but one that's probably a little too well liked by international conspiracy theorists
The asshole is still in prison, yelling about "all he knows" (new video came out of him last month,, making those claims)
They've given him the chance to talk several times
He never has anything to offer
I'll believe him if he says something tangible
Well maybe he shouldn't have been so honest with covid-19 deaths then
^/s
That's rich from somebody who butchers that language even more than we do
How about you stop using "heb" and "dat" as one size fits all words
It's "tueurs du Brabant" in French (so Brabant's murderers)
It wasn't the federal police as they didn't exist yet it was our gendarmes (rijkswacht) probably
As a result off all these failings thy abolished all our existing law enforcement and created what we have now local and federal
The father of someone I know was the head officer in the research of the Bende van Nijvel case
One day when he was completely sober and not tired he had a fatal car crash and the person I know thinks that de Bende van Nijvel killed his father because he came dangerously close with the research
He was the first person to suspect that they were officers
Hanlon's razor
"Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity"
Don't underestimate what rank and shortsightedness in police and so can manage to fuck up
Just finished ["White House Farm"] yesterday
Same thing there
Head investigator was so sure of the wrong suspect he wouldn't even consider anything else
>DCI Thomas "Taff" Jones, deputy head of CID, was so sure Sheila had killed her family that he ordered Bamber's cousins out of his office when they asked him to consider whether Bamber had set the whole thing up
I knew they didn't use Nijvel, but I thought it was another city, not the region
I know our current federal police didn't exist, but had a brainfart on how to best describe our rijkswacht: gendarmery, carabinieri, militarised national police, state cops with mandatory moustaches
Military branch that does police grunt work (so no investigative stuff) that wasn't part of the military anymore
Also "swans"
Ah yes when our motorcycles cops had harleys and trench coats
Do you guys also have an "official" colaboratory body
This one is the best name so far
But we fix them all the time like 24/7

I don’t think you know much about Belgium if you think it’s just Bruges/Antwerp/Ghent that’s worthwhile and has less to see than Riga alone
The answer is yes
There's many beautiful spots in Luxemburg
Source, my brother lives there and we've gone around
There's "la petite Suisse"
Wallonia has like a million castles and cool nature things to see
Idk where you’ve been
Brussels can be a letdown sure, it’s not for everyone
I think Brussels is more fun to live in than to visit as a tourist, that’s when you really appreciate it for what it is
Or so I e heard at least, all my friends who move there love it and that’s what I get from random people I’ve met there too
But Bruges and Ghent are more impressive than Riga imo in terms of the beauty of the cities
I do think Riga is more “fun” though if that makes sense, there’s more things to do and good parties
But obviously if you want parties in Belgium you just wait for Tomorrowland
I learned with the Belgian Francs my first year of primary school and we switched to Euros in my second year and had no difficulty at all adjusting
Old people often complain how expensive something is saying it's x amount of Francs which will sound like a high number because you have to multiply the Euro price by about 40 times but people my age are really happy with the Euro considering travelling before the Euro was introduced was really annoying with having to exchange money and all that and there being no real disadvantages

It's actually trying to hide behind Roma(nia), literally and figuratively
> Yet you felt the need to
Don't be dense, that's my entire point
Roma and Romanian sound very similar but have little in common except for a rather significant geographical overlap
(Technically you could argue that Romania does the same with the Roman Empire and Belgium with the Celto-Germanic Belgae, but those are entirely different discussions and the old entities don't exist anymore today
Of course not, I didn't say that

It's disgusting that we have the means to feed everyone on the planet and yet millions of people die of starvation each year
All because feeding them isn't "profitable".
And 80% of agricultural land is used to feed livestock

\>  Under the trade agreement, the EU will open its market to Japan's car industry, with Tokyo in return scrapping barriers to EU farming products, especially dairy
Aren't japanese cars already flooding the market
i know Mazda manufactures them in Japan then imports them (my mazda came from Japan) and they still manage to be competitive, they couldn't have had a very high tariff
What does it mean exactly to "open its market to Japan's car industry".

interesting, more than of the double of surface than Belgium but less population than Belgium (11,35 million in 2016)
> you don't end up as the rest of Western Europe, with most of our big cities being majority muslim
that's so far from the truth it's laughable
and a hint of islamophobia/xenophobia in there
Super anecdotal data from Belgium: there were 18 people in my primary class
I can say that in Belgium my class sizes have been between 12(exceptional) and 18(about what we expected)
Belgium:
Primary schools usually 23-25
Secondary schools range from 15-25 on average depending on what you are studying
We have a class with 3 people in my year
Higher educations: no sources
Belgium has no primary education
We start in high school
Belgium 25-20
I was in a class with 12 people for 6 years
It was heaven

Some people outside of the city of Rome make mocking variations on SPQR
For example, the Lega Nord right wing politician Umberto Bossi once used the much more biting ["Sono Porci Questi Romani"]
Stats should not be misinterpreted
This is not a graph showing the average happiness of citizens
I will link such a graph from google images (you can look for the source there)
Compare the graphs and notice that the whole of southern Europe is actually *unhappier* but they just don't kill themselves that easily
Now in my country the suicide rate is higher than anywhere in Western Europe but the happiness rate is among the best together with Netherlands and UK
Nobody going to talked about Belgium
Their men and women suicides are one of the highest in the world
... And why use double color gradients
The data is interesting, but this is not a good way to visualize it
There's plenty of highly upvoted comments about this, though
hardly "no one". But if you want to push a narrative, feel free
Exactly
As it stands, the visualisation leads the reader to think that the green coded countries on the men’s side are winners on some kind of morbid race
For the most part they are trying to keep the wheels in motion until the day there's a different president and they can when together again
The idea anyone is anyone else's bitch for trying to acquire or maintain international cooperation despite refusal of an idiot is very short sighted
Except that 'the child' commands more economic & military power than all the other people in the picture combined

What the fuck is this news site
There’s no report of this in our news
Which is odd, considering they’d jump on the opportunity to lament the fate of minorities
Why do they talk about nazi concentration camps
What has that got to do with anything

I haven't seen this on any BE news site yet
VRT has it, but there isn't any more info then in the OP
If this is football related, that's very unfortunate timing
Recently the Jewish community, on their own, without the Catholic Church or any imams , fought the ban on religious ceremonies at the highest court, and won
(The argument made in the media was that for Jewish religious ceremonies, at least 10 men have to be present, which was not allowed
Weddings here are atm max 5 including the pair
So the Jewish community has been in the media attention
I can imagine many people being quite angry (eventhough the Jewsih community did nothing wrong)
But during a deadly pandemic trying to change the emergency measures instead of adapting your own seemingly arbitrary customs is not a great look
So I was kinda expecting some antisemitism, but this is really bold
It's a nice fantasy to have, I agree
Cancer is a common swearword in the Netherlands which is close by there, I doubt they gave it that much thought
It’s the cancer part, not the Jews part
Yes, Belgians don't use cancer as a swearword
Only hear it in the Netherlands
modern antisemitism in western europe is mostly due to the israel-palestine conflict
It’s just a strange article
I’m not saying it didn’t happen
It’s actually very likely some teenagers think this is somehow funny
I just don’t see why Israelis are reporting on it and then the whole part about the Nazi detention camps
Just bugs me because we actually have one of the larger Jewish communities here in Antwerp and they’ve been living quite peacefully with the local Muslims
Makes Antwerp look bad for no particular reason
We Belgians are sophisticated people who prefer genitalia-based insults over disease-based ones

That's funny because I believe Chinanis one of the few countries with more wealth disparity than the USA
No he's not sabotaging anything
For decades, the right in the US has labeled anything from universal healthcare to a slightly higher gas tax as "socialist".
Healthcare provided by the government
Socialist
Taxes on the wealthy
Socialist
Environmental regulations
Socialist
Socialism just became a buzzword for right-wing media to demonize any left-wing policy
So Bernie, instead of consistently rebuking the claims that his policies are socialist, is going:"if that's socialism, then I'm a socialist, **so what**?"
You have to understand, playing defense in politics is a bad thing
Your opponent can just throw a quick one-liner at you which probably would take you a significant amount of time to explain why it's wrong what he's saying
Instead, you can just roll with it and turn the question on them:"if socialism is affordable healthcare for every citizen, what's so bad about that
". Now suddenly the right has to explain
Sure, the propaganda still runs deep for a lot of US citizens who fear the word socialism, but a lot of young people are going:"if what they have in Denmark is socialism, then I guess I'm a socialist". The label is losing it's effect when it comes to demonizing common sense policies
What if you don't like living over there
For let's say healthcare, education prices or gdpr
Ah definitely, I totally understand
I was was just projecting myself in your situation and asking myself what I would do
The US doesn't look like a country where I'd want to live but like you said, if the relationship is worth it
I find online privacy important, so yeah I included it in my reasoning why I'd rather live in Europe
I put it last because healthcare and education are more important

While not perfectly neutral by any means news in Flanders at least tends to be professional imo
Most newspapers, the actual news during the evening, etc
I mean ffs, even HLN in print isn't that awful imo
Their website though is obviously a disaster yes
I dunno, HLN is pretty close to this kind of shit
Such a trash paper
Is 't Pallieterke being printed, or just online ?
Indeed, HLN is a quality newspaper compared to the Mail
is it though
britian is in a horrible negotiating position
who's going to sign off on whatever crap deal they can muster
Even HLN profiles itself as a more chill, non-serious vacation newspaper
I really love Flemish newspapers (De Standaard/Tijd) for their professionalism and general aim for objectivity
They're hinting, but never as flagrant as the Daily Mail
The amount of blatant false news I've found on their site is hilarious
Ow no, it changed a lot over the years
I can only speak for the online version as I don't buy physical papers but the website just became more and more as you perfectly described, tabloidy
Also a huge difference between the printed version and online articles
Irrespective of any potential grudge, whatever deal the UK will get will be worse than the one they had since that one was easily the best one in the EU
The preferential treatment will fall away at the very least, so it will already be worse categorically
well, yes, the whole thing is obsiously pretty fucking sad
no deal is bad
a bad deal is bad
it's all fucking bad
there
that wasn't so hard to formulate
What newspaper did he pick up instead
DS too left
I mean, really
Also information was leaked which they didn’t know about
The Wehrmacht was actually just waiting for the allies at the specific location that was leaked
There are even images of the Germans shooting them out of them out of the sky with infantry and artillery
So you're gonna leave out like, more then half of my country
And like not include Spain at all
This is scuffed af
Finally a map overlay I can appreciate
The one we truly deserve
Walking like a Jojo character
I like this memEurope post !
So how many reports does it take to take down a post
Is it relative to the upvotes
An absolute number
I never realized that just a dozen reports is a significant number
Yours aren't?
What a beautifull continent we live on
The belgian flag is upside down
Thanks for this information
The Polish workers at my work site in Belgium were eating something different today and I wondered what it was
Belgium isn't on the list because we have no national government
Show me a country where people are happy with politics nowadays
I’m a businessman doing business
What does it mean
What should it be normally
Its like watching a car crash, i can't stop watching
Imagine helping defeat a terrorist with a fire extinguisher but everyone ignores you because some other dude used a fucking narwhal tusk
What about Peter Maffay's 'du' tho
Here are some other ... hmmm ... interesting [correlations]
Why was he wearing that ? Planning to come on ?
edit: Both managers can't wear black ? That's ridiculous haha
Congratz on remaking Italy in Minecraft, but why are you showing us a satellite image of Italy
why
Big balls for fending off ottomans
He's an opportunist
Damn Antwerp
Wtf Spain
What's with Belgium
Haha I love it, these Antwerpenaren won't be happy they'd fit right in with rural Wallonia
Wasn't the whole prince "scandal" him bedding a 17 year old
That's hardly pedophilia

I think your title is off
Or your geography
Put the Belgian flag in front of German as revenge
Only Germans cann tell the difference anyway
It is indeed
I happen to live in that part :D
Fine with me
But you gotta ask france and the Netherlands about that
They've claimed that spot first ;)
The left has been calling the conservatives homophobes, sexists and racist for years
Why even bother
To be bothered by accusations of the left
Wait Wait Wait, I thought it was the UK that caused, let me count, all Brexit problems and not the EU
I wonder who that spokeswoman is talking about an anti-democratic backstop when the pm hasn't even be elected and they refuse systematically to hold a second referendum
Yeah, the parties supporting the Irish backstop made up the majority of the electorate in Northern Ireland
But no one asks Northern Ireland what they want
Could somebody tell me, without bias, what this is about
What can we do
Email, is that it
I think I'll throw up if I have to address Marinho Pinto, to be honest
I guess it's a dirty job but we all have to do it
As an aside, a big thank you to whoever edited Marinho Pinto's Wikipedia entry
It's now spot on
Why are not all countries represented [here] I can see several members from Italy, Germany, Spain, ... but none from Belgium for example
How do I move
Here in Belgium we pay at least 35€ to get as much download and upload can be between 40Mbps Max to 7Mbps Max depending on the ISP
Absurd
Cries in Dutch with a different accent with twice the price for the same speed
If you're on Proximus, EDPNet will gladly provide the exact same connection on Proximus infrastructure for 35€ with a free landline thrown in cuz it's there anyway
Another thing we can thank Europe for
Most people here in Belgium have a separate bowl for it or something
Not much different from a fruit bowl
As you said, culture really
When I think of Germany I think of power and quality
Good thing the west has never sent in covert troups to any conflict
This sub constantly shits on Russia for things we also do, and then gets angry when that gets pointed out
Here is a novel idea, both sides of this powerstruggle are shit
This Russia bashing only serves to make our side seem like some enlightened utopia, when in reality its just as horrible, just a bit more hidden
On both sides the media only reports on bad things the others do
No, bad actions should be criticised
no matter who does it
The problem is that they are often criticised without involving the broader picture
The Ukrainian situation is far more complex than "hurr durr Russia invaded secretly just cuz they are evil".
*that* narrative just serves to shift the focus away from home

Point me to a pro Russia comment I have made
The USA,  was openly thinking about overthrowing the elected government of venuzeula, after meddling in their trade for years
But sure, we're not doing anything bad, or being violent against peaceful protestors in hambach trying to save some nature, we are the democratic pure free west after all
It is always the 'others' that are evil
Click the links, it's total bullshit
But whatever, comments about Cuba and the USSR are somehow pro Russian federation
With 'we' I assumed you meant the west/nato
The EU does support the US' imperialist agenda,  logistically and militarily
And we certainly do a lot of our own meddling
this is /r/sweatypalms material
Strategic move to keep that island for when the sea will rise
I thought Sint Pietersberg in maastricht was the tallest mountain in the Netherlands
They got too high to climb it
Hush
Let them have this moment
Yeah before we crush them with our mighty [Signal de Botrange] at 694 m
Looks like a somewhat false Wikipedia fact
[link]
If you go to the "three land point" in Maastricht you see the mountain going higher up across the border
It sure is the highest point in the Netherlands, but the higest peak of that mountain is in Belgium
The Netherlands can have it dho
We  even ski on our "mountains"...somewhat farther south
Excuse me the staircase makes it 700 m thank you very much
Superman on the left
and playing with super glue
The function of minister-president of the Netherlands doesn't have a maximum ammount of terms either, I think

it looks like we are under attack from le nord of France and the ruhr from germany
When only 2% of them doesn't know Belgium ...

Yay
Breakfast sad
It's not good is it
The EU, almost since its beginning, has been neoliberal
So, yes, it's aligned to parties on the right
One of possible good outcomes of the UK leaving is that Tories (or Blair like Labour) won't have the excuse of "we implement austerity because of EU rules", they'll have to own it
The EU has historically pushed very hard for deregulations and privatisation
That is up to British citizens
Once the Tories go on full welfare state nuking mode they can be put out of office and there won't be the usual EU excuse
They don't look that different
Title this with "family dress-up party, 1902" and it would be credible

According to the Estonian above you in this thread it’s pronounced like our word for onion: ui
Helpful comment
Indeed, we’d have to be sure the Estonian speaks perfect French to know how he pronounces “soeur”. If you’re right about ö (and I think you are) someone may have to tell him his French pronunciation is not up to speed
(x) Doubt
At least germany isn't using nuclear am I right
looks like she just farted and they are both like ... hmmmm what now
Well, even if it gets through the committee it still needs to be voted by the Parliament
Depends on the issue
Depends on the people
But yes, we still have it pretty good
Except for zero rating, we have net neutrality in Europe
No one is allowed to block or even slow down a particular service
As I said, zero rating is allowed, which is indeed one big compromise in the NN regulation, but they're not allowed to slow down (let alone block) any other service in order to achieve higher speeds for the zero-rated service
I looked up the Vodafone gigapass and from what I read (in my shaky German) it's just another zero rating example
I can't find articles where they say they speed up select partners
Interpol is merely a 'notification system', which enables you to 'signal' a suspect for example, and which can then be arrested by foreign police authorities
The extradition itself depends on whether or not there are extradition treaties in place between the country where the suspect was apprehended and the country that 'flagged' the suspect
It took me some time to realize that's not a notch or something in that speedo
That's his dick
That is not where dicks are on a body, everyone
If they are, I'm in need of a doctor ASAP
belly dick
Yeah sure, but they didn't paint the tits on the girl on her bellybutton, did they now
Ahead of its time
For anyone interested, the Belgian guy, Paul-Henri Spaak, ended up with quite the interesting international cv after this as well
* Chaired the first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations (General Assembly President)
* First President of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe
* First President of the European Coal and Steel Community (start of the EU)
* Second Secretary-General of NATO
He was also very influential in the treaty of Rome which led to the common market and the EU
BENELUX STRONK
and we're still having 7 governments in belgium (or 6, idk, idc, way to many)
Very nice
Eyyyy vlaams
1 federal, 3 communities, 3 regions should equate to 7, but since the Flemish parliament/government govern both the region and community it's *just* 6 parls/govs
the colours are horizontal so they don't have to renew their flag that often /s
We're already beer country #1 without you, and french is a fine language
Half the words from my dialect come from it
Let's call the country The Kingdom of Mighty Belgica and it's northern provinces

If COVID weren't making things difficult, I'd get to Scotland or Austria ASAP
This heat makes me want to chuck myself off my roof :)
I'm laying in a puddle of sweat
I hate the summer
Yeah, it’s bad here in Belgium
Said the guy/girl from *Iceland*.
We can't even leave for a colder place smh
Herfst, voile keeskop
Weird how belgium is so low swhen we have 3 official languages in Belgium and most younger people can speak english if not broken english
Unless i suppose its because we have 3 official languages, so the amount of foreign languages is less ? Like if your native dutch and have learned french its  not considered a foreign language because its one of the official ones ?
Lol Spain my arse
This statistic isn’t totally fair for Belgium because we have 3 official languages
Belgium at 77%, I wonder it has to do with the phrasing bc we have 3 official languages, meaning you could be trilingual with knowing a 'foreign' language technically
Well isn't it a subjective thing, some people say they can read another language, even though they can literally translate 5 words
Goddamned Wallonia dragging us down again
Belgium has a Dutch speaking part with French as second language, and a French speaking part with Dutch as second language
(German is the 3rd official language, English is very common too, as is Spanish)
But but efficiency
Why not make the river go over the canal
&#x200B;
Ah, I am told that this joke can only be made about Belgian canal bridges
So technically, all ships and boats passing under there are submarines
It's insane how many people have commented retarded suggestions so as to not use an aqueduct as if water is a solid matter without its own set of rules
Yes
I don't think I have ever heard anyone refer to it as anything else but the Forum Romanum
Hearing it being called "roman forum", even though it is a literal translation, somehow seems to make it seem like something lesser
What's up with the enclave of illiterates in France
My parent just checked that we weren't playing, but reading was left alone as long as we could get up to go too school
On ARTE
Was zapping and couldn't stop watching it
We Europeans need to stick together
I'm proud to be European when I see how we help each other out
Anyone just think the cartoon is hilarious
It's great
That's it, moving to Iceland
Bye
See those people saying that ultras started it and then they gave the police an excuse: I'm like 99% certain it was agent provocateurs
It happens all the fucking time
Happy cake day
Bro i was there this summer, all the buildings look ancient and old but inside they're modern
Most of the buildings are new but they have an ancient look on the outside
Beautiful
The EU poored a lot of money into building the new railway station, and modernising the tram network
So proud of my home town
Absolutely love the fact I was born and lived most of my life in Ypres
Second pic is not really today tho, there's a shitload of people standing in the square today
I would love to get your opinion on how the museum has changed
I remember visiting it in the beginning and again last year and to me, it has not improved
It is still a must for everyone interested, but in my humble opinion, it is just a normal museum nowadays, showcasing relics, basically, whereas in the beginning the museum managed to make you "feel" the horror that the war was
Thank you for sharing
You are definitely not wrong, but I hadn't looked at this from the kids point of view
If you catch my drift ;)
How can the executive branch lead a coup
Isn't a coup a forceful attack on said branch
Ah yes
Then the EU is undemocratic
>It’s like a grounding in the reality on both sides of the channel
The EU has always been pretty clear about what Brexit would mean, we're just waiting for the UK to get the message
Looks cool
Me and my mates turned 18 last years so we entered the competition to win free interrail passes and we won
We went to Scotland and it was one of the most beautiful trips I have ever been on, I highly recommend it
Interrail passes are amazing
Reminds me of the UK mobile network carriers advertising their data is now “free across the EU” free of charge
^(we were forced to, fuck you)
> Then we teach them how to properly curse
Granted, that *is* fun in Spanish
I mean, I assume correctly that "a" or "an" is about pronunciation right
Not necessarily how it's written
This is boat hilarious and sad
Fucking weird dutchies
Who doesn't have some weird fuckin' ancestors tho
Christ dude, twas a joke, chill the fuck out
Also, congo was the private property of one man and his company, the atrocities happened under some of the purest capitalism that has ever existed ;)
Well, that looks ominous
Imagine living off €400 a month
That sucks
Median gross salary
so much time and money wasted for the glory of god r/atheism
i get it it's a beautiful building, i can appreciate that, but how many people could you have fed with that much money ?
