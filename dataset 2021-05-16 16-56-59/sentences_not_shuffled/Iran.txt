Man this hit home : |
I'm starting to lose my grip on farsi
Cousin marriage, yep they're common
It's not THAT common people don't have the hapsburg jaw but unfortunately yes, it sometimes leads to down syndrome (most of them check DNA tests before marrying)
Well some old fashioned families still have control/power over their kids so sometimes it's arranged
the parents believe it's better to marry in the family
other than that it's just a matter of not really knowing
Like the first time I found out cousin marriages are frowned upon was on the internet (English sites mostly)
That we ride camels, yeahhh
I stole this phone from a tourist
No we just fuck em
Old rivals eh
Well I mean who can deny the absolute gorgeousness of Greek history and culture but we did use to be pretty serious rivals once in a time :)
since we use a different alphabet it's hard for you to read but here it goes:
جان مید هیز وی تو ا تورن ترو د دارک فارست, انلی تو فایند اوت دت هی فورگات  د مانی
we don't have the (th) sound tho
It won't get as much media coverage in the world but a young man was brutally tortured IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET by a police officer and died and the government in covering it up by saying he was a junkie
Do we really have to talk about it
All of [Hayedeh's] songs , he had a heavenly voice
I think it's the ONLYYY thing all Iranians can agree on regardless of who they are
You're welcome friend
Oh I absolutely love it, I actually have it on my phone, BTW we love your music
Yes to each his own I guess and people like Tatlis are legendary in here :)
Well it is illegal of course but as someone who is 18yo I could say 80 percent of my friend have tried it at least, fairly popular with young men and teenage boys but it's not very common
[weakest Iranian ]
[well this guy ]
Looks somewhat above average but I would say he looks just enough for a 20-30 yo,  we mostly have curly hair and beard and somewhat white to brown skin
Yeah for sure, we fill our our fridge bottles with tap water too
Well we often call our friends "Dadash" meaning the same bro everyone uses
We were  the strongest obstacles to Romans an obstacle they never conquered,
So, noo
No, period
The postman is required to ring the door and deliver the package to the household, if you're not home they'll just go away and come back another time
My government shot a passenger aircraft with a fucking missile, denied it for 3 days and then nobody even got fired after 1 year
Horse shoe theory I guess
Ooof you wouldn't know, I mean you could travel 60 kilometers and the dialect would change
Astara, Gilan province is located right at the Azerbaijan border and the city is divided between the two countries
I'm Iranian
Normal people in Iran are generally happy that he's dead despite the news saying otherwise he was the military dictator under Khamenei in Iraq
The is talk of "revenge" from the Iranian regime but if they try to pull this revenge there will definitely be war
The US did this to justify any war if Iran tries to pull any fuckery
Well we do have some old grudges againt the us (overthrowing mossadegh and making the shah a dictator) but this was NOT something we get upset over
He killed many during recent years including people in the recent protests
People are happy but concerned
Thank you random citizen :)
Warzawa/Warsaw is called "Warshow" and Vienna is "Vian" otherwise it's just the same in English
Greece is "Yonan", Germany is "Almaan", Egypt is "Mesr", and to piss off the Dutch we call the Netherlands "Holland"
We don't even use Cyrillic or Latin so I can't really tell IF we have a layout
That we were never THE most advanced nation of the time, yeah we and the Greeks were cool back in the day but Persia was never the better one
Well we pretty much understand Afghans for that matter, our languages are like dialects rather than separate languages
I don't know What do you mean as a second language
Farsi (Iranian Persian) is our first language and we can understand Dari (Afghan Persian) well enough :)
A typical 25 yo person can't even find a job in my country, and even if they do their expenses will be higher than their paycheck
People should see you peeing, obviously we're talking strangers and family otherwise if it's with friends it's alright
Lemme get uh 1979 revolution with extra islam
Los turns out pissing the mongols is a bad idea
Not European but :
because most of our history is written (one language or the other) nothing is THAT obscure even from 5th century b.c (except the time Arabs burned many historical evidence written in the old Parsi language)
° Why would the last Kharazmi Shah order the murders of the mongol caravan
,  don't caravans mean business
What would Iran look like if the Mongols hadn't invaded
° Why didn't Yazdgerd retreat the way The Bizantines did from the Arab invasion
If the Arabs didn't succeed Iran would be very different, perhaps Zoroastrian, having our own alphabet, being very distinct from the rest of the middle east
° and how did Cyrus come to conquer those vast amounts of land starting as a vassal in the small median empire from Persis (now the province of Fars)
And there this one funny thing about the Farsi language, we can (not easily but are able) to read 2000 year old texts written in ancient Parsi (farsi), but were not able to read 200 year old texts and documents
Yeah the Farsi language hasn't changed that much in the past 2000 years (except alphabet and some structures) but 200 years ago it contained a lot of French and Arabic so its mostly impossible to read for the average Iranian lmao
Damn bro you know our history better than us lmao
Long story short the Arab invasion brought a lot of Arabic to farsi making it impossible to read, we sent students to France for studies during the 18th centuryso we had (and have) a lot of French loan words, but the pahlavi dynasty tried to root out foreign influence in farsi so it became much more farsi and less French and Arabic
Well
uhh
Well I guess we made the first human right bill
Ironic eh
Most counties end with "abad" roughly being translated to settlement/town
We say "Alo,Salam" (Salam meaning hello) but for Alo I don't know why, I don't know what it means, but I'm guessing it's French because they really helped us with industrialization and most of our technical words are French
Fun fact : even the most common "thank you" word in farsi is "Merci"
No all of them are written in the Farsi alphabet but they're not just technical words,  many common words too
I can say like 20% of daily spoken Farsi has some kind of French word in it
(بتون آرمه) or it's French form "béton armé" just means reinforced concrete and it's used very widely or bike helmet which is ( کلاه کاسکت) is just farsi alphabet for "Casquette" (helmet)
Uh I don't know the exact date but like maybe 601-530 BC during Cyrus's lifetime yeah its been quite a ride
Well we're stubborn bastards I guess, but really I think we're just good at swallowing our invaders
Alright thanks I might check it out
Yeah you're absolutely right
Don't get me wrong there are people who genuinely practice Islam in here but most people don't like it, we mostly see it as an Arab religion rather than just a religion
Perhaps because it was never nationalized  like catholicism was translated or reformed, long story short people aren't so keen on Islam
Anytime bro
In all of human history we have controlled the most population of the human world (during the persian empire 40% of earth population)
Idk no one ever talk or thinks about Iran
Yeah that does seem to be the problem with us, same as hungarians being huns I guess
Well we call it " Vezarate defa'" or Defence ministry
Oh belive me, when your money is "$1  = 360,000, Iranian rials" no one wants or needs a nuclear programme
I wasn't joking actually BUT we don't calculate 360,000
We call our money TOMAN and it's like 36 T equals a dollar
So due to massive amounts of inflation a square meter of a downtown house is like 20,000 T, and the average person makes like 3000 T a month so you get the point
The other they I was looking for something, you know those bricky ass nokia phones
They were like 40 T  four or five years ago, now they're 1500 T so yep its fucked up
I donno most people think I'm joking when I say we have to pay 360,000 rials in order to get one dollar
A decent government
I got you fam
Well my parents used to just call my shortened name
But one thing that I liked was my uncle calling me "fandogh" (hazelnut)
We got [Takhte] but it's not that common we often play card games
Common greeting
I uhhhhh
, well uh
Let's say
We didn't... We still hang people on a daily basis
Why don't some European governments make vaccines mandatory
It's not mandatory here but people believe in vaccines in the most remote regions, besides you can't go to school without proper vaccinations
So all I'm saying is in countries like the U.K and U.S why doesn't the parliament or the Congress make vaccines mandatory on birth
Is it possible or will it have backlash
Somehow they used the wrong formula and got the right answer
Idk why but this comment made e think of the time I colonized the whole world as Portugal in eu4
Old European monarchs do but not modern ones
I don'y wanna say it but it's the reality
say that we're Arabs or speak Arabic, if you don't know people usually let it slip but if you intentionally say it there is a risk to receive a free beatdown
yeah mate the local name for Persian is Farsi
it's the same
Out of all people, We have Polish Krakow sausage sandwiches
Like how
Yeah I read somewhere that we had good relation from like the 1500s and 120,000 polish refugees came to Iran
It is really a shame what happened last year and I really think it was our fault
Yeah all those are Iranain food
It's sad to see so much hostility between us, I hope our politics get along together someday :) cheers
I don’t think there’s going to be a war between Iran and the US
Both of them have a strong military force and Iran isn’t a “destroyed” country like Syria or Iraq
The tensions are high, but I think it’s like the Cold War between USSR and the US
That’s just what I think and I hope I’m right
lekker kontje
As an Azerbaijani, I have to agree
He looks like Borat
Smh Yanks
I was in Florence 2 days ago, and it was 37 degrees Celsius
Wait why is this downvoted
No Erdoğan, You can not have northern Iran
Its still depressingly bad here in the north
The hell is wallachia
>Even an average German can run the US govt better than he can
I legitimately think that's true tbh
Just not starting trade wars and antagonizing your 4 biggest trade partners would probably already be a better economic policy
Or focusing on building a connection to the actual governments of other countries, not to opposition parties
Or just listening to people with experience and be aware that you may or may not have strengths, but others have theirs too so maybe you shouldn't pretend like you know everything
Even a US-president just spending his time digging holes on the beach and being a smart-ass might actually be more beneficial to the US
Not when it comes to luxury, upper middle-class cars
BMW/Mercedes/Audi own that market
Honestly most of eastern Europe could benefit from a benevolent dictator like they have in Oman
The corruption runs too deep, waaaaay too deep to just overthrow 2-3 figures or a party and be rid of them, the new party, no matter how well-intended, will have to make compromises to get anything done and with time will find itself just as corrupt
Eastern Europe needs a strongman to hold power for 10-20 years during which time democracy is slowly and properly implemented
Good thing they restored it back to its original form and not into a Brutalist nightmare
Man this hit home : |
