Before J.F.K was assassinated he conjured a plan code named "Operation Brother Sam" to "prevent Brazil from becoming another China or Cuba". Brazil's president at the time, João Goulart, was left wing, which means everybody already thought he was a communist, including the folks at the CIA
Goulart also made the mistake of going to China, and that was all the proof anybody needed to say he was a communist, so Lyndon B. Johnson, gave the go ahead for the US Navy to support a coup d'état, which lead to the military dictatorship, when our military tortured, killed, kidnapped, exiled, and used warfare tactics against civilians, for over 2 decades
Most of the military went unpunished, because of the Lei de Anistia, which forgave the crimes of the military and the resistance of course that didn't help the resistance much, because most of them already had been killed
Years later those protections against the military where rolled back by President Dilma Rousseff, who was tortured during the dictatorship and was justifiably pissed
But the military operates by military law, not civil law
So basically the only people punished were those how had gruesome methods and didn't care for covering their tracks

I 100% agree with the Labour party that there should be a new general election, because  I think the Brits realised that voting conservative is a bad idea
right
Horrible
I 100% agree with the labour party that there should be a new general election, bc the brits probably learned that voting Conservative is a bad idea
right
Seriously, you guys haven't seen anything

Believe it or not, money is not everything
Well just imagine all the problems that usually comes with big cities: traffic, violence, inequality, pollution
Now scale that to a city of 20 million people and add a pinch of Brazilian chaos

God, those pictures of bus stops are what Heaven probably looks like
The "you stole our gold" thing at least here is just a meme (quite an overused and unfunny one, being honest)
People here barely talk about Portugal at all really
Our scapegoats to blame for the Brazilian poverty usually are our own culture (there is the belief among some of us that we are a country of thieves and liars), politicians and sometimes the USA for Operation Condor
Grimm (the TV series) does this to the most horrendous extent I've ever seen, at least in earlier seasons

A Canadian posted about Canada's history so I might post some of Brazil's as well:
• [The Christie Question] that resulted in a formal apology from the British Empire to the Brazilian Empire
• [The Paraguayan War] the second most bloody war in the history of the Americas
• The Vargas' ["Estado Novo"] a totalitarian government that endured for 8 years in Brazil and that persecuted every single form of opposition: the Democrats, the Communists and even the Fascists
• [The Lobster War] the time Brazil and France went on the international court to avoid a war over, guess what, Lobsters
• [The 1964 Coup] that was backed by the Americans and installed a Military Junta in Brazil for 21 years
I do not sympathize with fascism or Nazism, but I have already read about this period in Austrian history and it's extremely interesting and a awesome scenario to imagine
The idea of a Social Democrat militia is just bizarre

Ah yes, because Spanish = south america = jungle

My mother's side of the family is of Italian origin, and if you see them "talking" over a Sunday meal, it looks like a scene taken from a comedy sketch
They just don't scream "MAMA MIA" because nobody learned Italian
To be fair, that triggers most people from the Americas nowadays
Because we had lots of people here before Columbus (or vikings or chinese) came, and the term "discover" is being rejected
>The thing that annoys us the most is thinking we are Spanish or that we speak Spanish
We get the same treatment here
Hahahaha

> Also, sometimes brazilians will ask us to "give back their stolen gold".
That is mostly a joke, but I guess there are always dumb people
Sometime ago someone asked about that in r/asklatinamerica and I think we all agreed that it's been too long and asking for reparations nowadays make no sense

I know you've celebrated your independence recently
Thank you
It was yesterday, although we don't have much to celebrate about right now

Just a question, Latin Americans are keen on gate-keeping when it comes to skin tone, 'colourism' as we call it, one of the shittiest legacies of colonization here
i love to read romanian texts and recognise some words (and some quotes too)

That's what triggers our local buffer state (Uruguay) the most too

>Most people in Brazil credits the airplane invention to [Santos Dumont]
>He is a huge source of national pride and was the first person to make a craft capable of full flight
The Wright brothers came afterwards and claimed to have flown earlier, but showed no evidence and their plane was not able to take off on its own, but they are given the credits for the airplane invention as they are American
Quoting from somewhere else in this thread
I'm reasonably good at geography, but I admit that sometimes I need to stop and think which one is which
There are some wild claims that the chinese would know about America in the XV century, but it's probably not true
I mean if you're all living in Denmark you're all immigrants, right
In Portugal's case, it's called "Iberian Peninsula" and I'm sure you can pick a fight with a Portuguese by calling it "Spanish Peninsula".
> colonisation of the Americas was a bit of a shit deal for the Indigenous population
When you look for "euphemism" in a dictionary they show this phrase
hahaha
I feel like brazilians struggle in the beginning with Portugal portuguese, but once you get used to the accent is pretty much the same language
I've never heard of any portuguese person having issues understanding brazilian portuguese
the lack of pluralization happens because of the italian immigration to brazil
Basically italians don't have the S plural in their words so the ones who went to São Paulo and southern states didnt speak quite well and this became part of the region accent
i totally understand your angry about it, but don't you think it's kind of great to have all this mixture in a language, like, this diversity (that problably wouldnt exist if portuguese is just spoke in portugal)
idk, the majority of slaves that went to brazil came from places like congo and ghana, and they went to other regions like RJ or northeast, but it could be as well
well, think about the US southern accent, some people from other english speaking countries might think it is just bad, but i think its fair to say that this isnt a good or bad matter
same with brazilian accent
i totally understand that speaking about communication to have all this diference between accents do worse the language, but this is how it works
Northern portuguese accent is very diferent from the Algarve one, which is very diferent from the Açores one, which is very diferent from the Angolan one, and so on and so on
This diference doesnt happen because of randomness
My point is that this happens with all languages, and while it might not be good to standardization, it shows how great this world can be and how languages can be a demonstration of culture and all diversity of cultures that exist
I can fairly understand until Middle English, but I'd say that being poetry makes it way harder than it should be I believe
Sometimes I struggle to read poetry even in my own modern language

People act like there would be a sudden decrease in productivity when we already waste a huge chunk of working hours on the internet or just not doing shit
The idea that you must stay in the office for 4 hours doing nothing after you finished your job for the day just because someone says you need to is just asinine
The idea is that you would keep the same pay as before, no one is arguing for less pay for minimum wage workers here

Los hermanos de Argentina
Umm Argentina maybe
Pelé > Maradona
Jumping on the " Non europeans are welcome to answer too
" But besides the obviousness that is Argentina and to some extent Uruguay, which many answered in r/asklatinamerica already, we have a sports rivalry with France and Germany, it doesn't need explanation, does it
And a "memetic warfare" rivalry with Portugal as well it seems
>!Sports rivalry with Netherlands and Belgium are kinda set aside because they weren't as shocking as 1998 and 2014
For Brazil: Argentina
We got over 7x1 after defeating Germany once, but losing to Argentina
We already have the most World Cups, so we almost take it as world cup<losing to Argentina
Yes, a healthy rivalry
>Doesn't snow that often during the summer
You're saying there's _less snow_ during the summer, instead of no snow

Do you think that if the Swedish government builds brutalist apartment blocks like the Soviets (standardized and mass-produced but relatively ugly houses) it could solve the problem
Would Swedish society accept this solution
That's what a bathroom looks like in a low-income neighborhood house where I live
Certainly didn't expect that
I can't agree more
Not necessarily
League of Legends is a game that made the best use out of the loot box model imo
You can still buy 99
99% of what you want directly in the shop with no BS luck involved, but the loot boxes exist to give you a chance to earn stuff for free
They even let you buy stuff with the free currency for cheaper by using the loot system
It's honestly something I wish more games did, the concept behind loot boxes is not bad by itself, but the implementation most companies have found for it are god-awful
They pretty much are
Little Jimmies have been spending 100s of dollars/euros on TF2 hats or csgo skins long before people suddenly decided to crusade against lootboxes because now it's evil EA instead of Gabe Newell doing it
Card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon have had literally the same system but physically for ages as well, and they're not even cosmetic like most lootboxes, those are things that you actually need to play the respective games
Star Trek
It was a big thing for quite some time over on r/brasil, we still use it from time to time but not to the extent r/ich_iel does

Don't forget about the part where they took our gold

Esperando alguém chegar aqui com uma língua românica obscura como o romanche, piemontês ou sardo
Algo que acho interessante é  que mesmo o catalão sendo uma língua ibérica, eu a considero mais difícil de entender do que francês. Deve ser provavelmente por causa da minha familiaridade com o inglês, uma língua com raízes no francês.
Relevante:
Me pergunto o quão similar é esse comentário ao português quando pronunciado
Eu entendi praticamente tudo, menos a palavra "spiegare".
Aquele sentimento quando você entende a mensagem sem enter quase nenhuma palavra
Only the context
Some very simple words like "est" and "tertiam" are telligible due to my familiarity to other languages(és from spanish and tertiary from English, respectively)
Interessante como vizinhança em italiano é mais parecido com português do que espanhol, ao menos na pronúncia

It’s the best in Latinamerica, tied with the Puc in Santiago
I sure hope the colony ones count otherwise it's Pedro
Now that's some variety
me too haha
I would say any public project is a badly executed one, and I'm not even joking
The Portuguese word "saudade". It expresses a feeling I've never seen another word in another language to express it
That feeling when you feel someone's absence, remembers all the good times you spent with that person, whether you have that person around at that moment, is the pain of the absence of a loved one
It is the word with the most beautiful meaning I know and much of Portuguese culture is based on it
Can confirm, we seemingly brag about that word whenever someone starts talking about our language
It can also mean just missing someone, depends on the context
In Portuguese Cornelius would almost have "corno" as its root, which means "cuckold".
Brazil definitely needs a list like this
Wow, I didn't know EVE Online was developed in Iceland
Never actually played it but that game is huge
It was home to some of the largest ever virtual battles in history, like the Bloodbath of B-R5RB in 2014, which involved more than 7,500 online players and there's even a Wikipedia page about it
Iceland produces so many cool stuff with such a small population, it's mindblowing
Banjo-Kazooie, the Donkey Kong Country trilogy, GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark, Conker's Bad Fur Day, and every Rare gem there ever was
That's very impressive

Here in Brazil the name for kite changes from region to region
I believe it's called papagaio in some places too, but in Rio it's called pipa or arraia depending on the type of kite
Was he wearing white shoes
Birds don't have teeth
Or a country who believes it's the center of the world
Yeah, it’s pretty common
I’d say doing such thing is definitely more common in countries like Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany though
I’ve heard a lot of people do it to buy goods if they live really close to the border
literally anyone except for the very dark-skinned africans and Indians
Everyone else may look Brazilian to me, we’re just too diverse
I just use Portuguese wikipedia to learn about Brazil
Everything else in English is much better
Not european but I think the answer fits and it's good enough to warrant a pass to me
In Brasil I've seen it called the Altar of the drunk, as drunk people will knee in front of it, but only in vomiting situations
In Brazil: The little throne
I thought this was r/asklatinamerica for a second and got real confused
why is that
Were there any pros to communism
Or just cons
Legit question
i see
here in southern brazil garibaldi is also considered a hero for his achievements in the ragamuffin war, but we don't really know much of his participation in the unification of italy, i didn't know til now that he was to blame for the independence of san marino
btw, do you know if theres still some people in favor of an unification movement in italy/SM or the relationship between the two countries is really no matter at all
Thanks a lot
Considering it’s Iceland, I’m surprised you didn’t find out he was your cousin too

Portuguese speaker here, also know some spanish
French one: I understood what the [Titanic] was just fine, despite a lot more difficulty by the end of the paragraph
I can get the general meaning, but most words are unintelligible to me
Second hardest
Spanish: I also understood who [Mother Teresa] was in spanish absolutely perfectly, although i do speak spanish, just not very well, so it's not very fair
Italian: I now also have a general idea who [Cecilio Stazio] was, apparently some influencial writer of what appears to have been comedic teather plays in the Roman Empire
It wasn't quite as easy as spanish, but sure easier than french
Romanian: I could only understand that this orthodox
Monestary
Church
Temple
named [Mănăstirea Plătărești] was built ("construită" meaning "construida" is not hard to guess) betwen 1642 and 1646
not much more, though
Hardest to understand by far
Catalan: So apparently the [Sixth Avenue] is officially called "Avenue of the Americas", and has a both names on signs
I understood it about as well as i understood spanish, so they don't seem to be a very different language at all
As much difference as brazilian and european portuguese, in my eyes
Galician: Easiest to understand by a longshot
It's pretty much just a mix of portuguese and spanish, apparently
Considering i speak both of those languages (to drastically varying proficiencies), i understood what [titanium] is just fine
The Portuguese translations I have seen are pretty close to that
Few differences are that Baggins is "Bolseiro", which is bag-maker
Aye, forgot to specify that part
I thought every romance language did this with these kinds of movies/books tho, surprised Portugal is different in that regard
I just looked at a few pictures, but I Imagine it's just a bit hard to go around Rome using a car instead of public transport because it's a really old city
But then again, I imagine it's like that for a lot of places in Italy
I might be completely wrong
I can imagine how big of an asshole he is because you chose him instead of Putin

Not only it's funny with all it's quirkyness and british accent, it's also very democratic ! A constant back and forth debate set up in a confrontational manner
They don't have debates during election years, they have debates every week !
I wish our president came to answer questions from congress every week and congressmen could shout at the president
What's the context of this ?
>He is like that, the parliament's buffoon
Careful
He might become prime minister in the future
No one took Bolsonaro or Trump seriously before they were elected
But why did that guy brought flowers and lifted him by his crotch ? That was super weird
> He's from a Catalan separatist party
That's typical
Politicians like this are usually nationalists or radical of some form
Let's hope, but let's not underestimate him again
He is probably gonna win Florida
If he wins Pennsylvania, he's probably gonna win reelection
Acre doesn't exist/there's dinosaurs and the internet just made it there

One year ago I went to Ireland to a enhance my English and 6 months ago I came back to Brazil because of the pandemic (being close to my family and stuff)
It was a decision that I took too quickly, and I should have waited a bit more
I don't know if I will ever go back
I want, of course, but since I don't have any european passport I have to be enrolled in some course to have the permission to live and work 20h per week maximum, and that isn't quite easy way to live forever

It’s more of a British thing
I used to wear them but now I never have spare coins to buy one at school
Anyways, I heard it’s seen as a nationalistic symbol (sort of) and I don’t really stand for that
What do you mean
So they approve the shorter form in Czech, but not in English
We call the USA *the United States* here; the most used gentlic is *American*, though
I have a hard calling the country “Côte d’Ivoire” here: it sounds kind of pedantic
Lucky for me, the country does not come up often in conversations
Usage of the shorter name (*Tchéquia*) is not common here in Brazil
I don’t think it is weird, and I have used it for a while, but most of the times I end up having to explain the reason behind this different name to others
The change requested by the Netherlands (from *Holanda* to *Países Baixos*), though, is harder, especially because the new gentilic (from *holandês* to *neerlandês*) is too different from the new name
I left Prague with this impression
For instance, a tour guide was against an adoption of the euro for what seemed to be a preservation of part of the nation’s identity
You are correct, aside from the misspelling of *Chéquia*. It is just that Portuguese speakers are used to call it *República (T)Checa*, and it can be hard to change habits
Though competition with Brazil
And if they keep complaining you will also burn their car
The Germans might disagree
Argentina doesn't need this kind of rule
I didn’t know that
I just knew Penedo was a cool and well-sought-after touristic destination but not a single word about Finns founding the town
I’ll definitely move the town up some spots on my homeland‘s places to visit
Thanks
The mixture of indo European Portuguese and finno ugric Finnish makes up for a very unique combo
It’s sad it wasn’t recorded and documented as it should
It’ll be my pleasure, friend
Cheers
How odd
I wasn’t expecting that like *at all*. I’ve always thought PT-BR was easier to grasp but I definitely would never think it could resemble Savonian Finnish
I also must say I got a little envy of that Brazilian fella on the train mate
lol bc I’d have a blast to explain someone the difference between them and to speak something in a Portuguese accent and in a Brazilian accent for comparison
I’m really into languages and helping someone get the sound and feel of Portuguese language would be a great exercise for me and a lot of fun as well
Zinkzand sounds like a stereotypical german english accent

From "poor" country, can confirm
I think it's important to define who we are calling rich

Are upper middle class people who own one or two nice cars and a modern home rich enough for the purposes this discussion
Infant Dom Henrique, founder of the magnificent Sagres school, would be extremely proud
Agree with my Mexican friend
And we can't forget the word "marreta" which means the same thing, but I think it is cooler
is that just for beer or do other drinks cost as much
I see an united EU kinda like the US in terms of language, technically the main language would be English because it's what most people speak, but no actual official language, and every region (Spain, France, Netherlands, etc) would still have their own language as the one you use to go to school to, deal with the government and such
You just couldn't have a country that would rule over so many different cultures and have them all adopt a single language, that would lead to insurrection and even independence-seeking rebellions extremely quickly
Speaking not as a Brazilian, but as a speaker of the most beautiful language in the world, the language of Camões and Fernando Pessoa: if even we, natives of the Portuguese language, we have enormous difficulties in understanding the grammar of our own language due to the huge number of exceptions and  details that we must memorize, why in this world would a German, for example, be able to study this language
He would fall into a fetal position crying when he see the verb conjugation lists and the infinity of verb tenses, he would go into despair at seeing the lists of rules of verbal conduct, adnominational adjuncts, complements, commas and accentuation
Sometimes many people take their entire school life to master this grammar
Some sounds, like the nasal ones, are a nightmare even for Spaniards: you have to use your nose to make a nasal sound without your tongue vibrating
This "blessed" sound is very common in the language and pronouncing it in the wrong way can get you into trouble
Whenever Europeans use English as a lingua franca, Dr
Zamenhof turns over in his grave
If the EU were to impose a lingua franca on the education system to reduce translation costs, Esperanto is the best alternative
In less than 6 months you will be fluent and word formation is extremely easy
Just memorize the suffixes, prefixes and radicals and you can say anything
The grammar is extremely regular and for those who like to travel, there is the Pasporta Servo network
By registering in it you get free hosting anywhere in the world where you have an affiliate as long as you are ready to welcome other members of the network into your home
Imagina só que maravilha os alemães tendo que decorar as nossas conjugações e regência verbais, regras da crase, tendo que discernir entre um complemento nominal ou um adjunto adnominal, saber as regras da vírgula
Até eu que sou nativo choro em posição fetal quando tento estudar gramática, imagina então os estrangeiros
Isso sem falar nas palavras homofonas e nas regras da ortografia
As escolas de idiomas iriam faturar muito dinheiro num mundo onde a língua mais bela do mundo, a flor do Lácio, é a lingua franca
A taxa de reprovação seria altissima
But we are talking about a common language for the European continent
Esperanto will fit like a glove
Cold: 10 - 15
Chilly: 15 - 20

I don't really share a lot of stuff about my country on my social media accounts because I believe that is usually reserved to news organizations
Seriously
I hate to be one of those "thoughts and prayers" people
I mean, I care about it, but then again, even if I put some effort writing about it, it's still "thoughts and prayers".
oh believe me, most of us also hate Brazilian dubs
but hey, look at the bright side: at least people don't think you speak Spanish xD
hey now, don't ruin my moment here ok
I guess that's something the Brazilian diaspora does
Anyway, I should point out that I'm probably in the minority
Brazilians are very active in social media

Bolsonaro is racist and homophobe, I also hate him, but Lula is a fucking disgusting traitor
Is there a saying in your country that refers to another nationality
When you are in a very bad situation, we here in Brazil use a saying to refer to this situation "I am more screwed than an Irish without potatoes". Does your country have a similar saying
>When you are in a very bad situation, we here in Brazil use a saying to refer to this situation "I am more screwed than an Irish without potatoes"
No, we don't. /r/quityourbullshit OP
I have never seen someone using that expression lmao but I will start using it bc its too perfect
Aqui no Brasil nós temos esse ditado também kkkk
Funny, we similarly use "Paraguayan" as synonym for "fake", because they actually sell tons of fake products, such as brand clothes, and lots of brazilians go to the border to buy them
We call it a turkish bath here in Brasil

Have a character that was born in one country but moved to the other with their family at a young age, and is caught in the classic "am I loyal to my homeland ot the place that made me who I am today
" conflict, while being seen as English to the French and vice versa
Then the story branches out depending on which side you choose, potentially riding along with Jeanne d'Arc or deciding whether she burns or is just imprisoned for example
Hell, you could take advantage of the fact that it was fought over such a long period of time and have a bunch of different storylines with different characters all throughout the different conflicts, playing both English and French nobles, but also peasants, knights, and merchants

This is how it works in portuguese too
Lately with all the attention non-binary people have been getting some have started using the letter "E" when gendering words (instead of the male O or female A)
Especially adjectives and pronouns
I get why they do it, but it just sounds weird
Same in portuguese
what is the most famous music from your country that is not the national anthem
Interesting how you include variations of vowels as separate ones
In portuguese we have á,à,â,ã,é,ê,í,ó,õ,ô,ú, but we only refer to aeiou as vowels
Huh, interesting
I thought they were just accents
TIL, thanks
Don't know if it counts (since I've never been in any of the countries cited), but, I've already realized that the French do not dress like those fancy people drinking coffee outdoor in a Parisian restaurant as you may see in movies, not all Germans are pale, blonde and blue-eyed, not all Italians are dark-skinned and brown-eyed like Sicilians nor look like Mario Bros, the average Portuguese do not look like Pedro Álvares Cabral, Finns are not Mongolic, the Scots do not wear kilts all the time, the English do not have weird teeth, not all Irish people are pale, have freckles and are redheaded, etc
Lol

I once ran an RPG session set in the far future where the human galactic feudal empire had 2 main languages: Hindu, which was the language of the lower classes, and a hybrid of German with Slavic languages, which was the language of the higher classes
I'm from Brazil
Just wanted to share my story
Here in the South of Brazil everyone knows what  "rapariga" means
No, not at all
The population of the African Portuguese-speaking countries (Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe) is growing very fast, and it is expected that the population of these countries together will easily surpass Brazil and Portugal, the current language centers
It is assumed that Portuguese will have around 500 million speakers by 2050, and will be the most widely spoken language in the southern hemisphere of Planet Earth
The same is true for French, where Congo today has more French speakers than France itself
So I am reassured
The average profile of the speakers of my native language will only change, Africans will keep the language alive for a long time to come
Before, the speakers of this language were mostly Portuguese and today the language is practically dominated by Brazilians
Now we will pass the baton and it will be the turn of the Africans to take the lead
And to top it off we have countries like Angola and Mozambique with a population that is growing very fast
What will happen is that the profile of the speakers of Camões' language will change a lot: first it was a primarily Portuguese language, then it was dominated by a Brazilian majority, and now we will see African countries (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe) having a Portuguese-speaking population larger than Brazil and Portugal combined
The same is true for French and we will see French, English, Arabic, and Portuguese as the dominant languages of Africa
From what I have seen, Portuguese is used in these countries as the lingua franca that allows communication between different peoples
In most cases, it is used as a second language, with the exception of the capital regions where the Portuguese presence was more present and the population of these regions use Portuguese as their main and first language
This is basically what happens in India: a European language is used to "connect" different peoples with languages from different families, but the populations continue to use their native languages at home, in the most intimate moments
P.S.: What happened here in Brazil was that the native indigenous population went through a genocide: either the populations that did not accept the Portuguese presence were killed by the Portuguese and their allies, or the populations that accepted the Portuguese presence mixed with the Portuguese colonizers through marriage and sex
This generated a huge mixed population, which we call here Mamelucos, children of Portuguese and Indians
These populations, including the Portuguese colonizers, adopted Tupi, one of the indigenous languages and used by the people who were allied with the Portuguese, as lingua franca, creating Nheengatu (also called modern Tupi)
Even the Portuguese elites spoke Tupi in daily life and only used Portuguese for official events
These are two different cases: the colonization of the African countries was done in a system where the Portuguese went with their entire families and did not mix, in the case of Brazil, as the technology was more rudimentary, only the men came and they got together with the native women (obviously, if you are a man you can understand their situation: they would leave an extremely Catholic and conservative country with extremely coy women and no habit of bathing to arrive in a country full of beautiful women, naked, clean and shaved after having spent months in dirty places full of men, only having masturbation to relieve sexual tension
What would happen next is extremely predictable, they would either beg the captain to make alliances with the natives or unfortunately resort to rape, having children mixed up in both situations as a result)
Ah yes, [the legendary portuguese dub]

Nope, its very very very uncommon

Nationalism will be the biggest challenge we'll be facing the next following years
It doesn't matter the country, every place is the same rhetoric and narrative
EDIT: My point on nationalism is not a criticism on our love for the place that we belong, but to these right wing/populist politicians that use that kinda of love that we had to close the doors of comunication between nations by attacking other natiions or creating old tensions
We reached a point where most of the countries in the World had gained independecy due to nationalism, but it dated very bad today
We don't need it anymore
Welp, the Summer is going to end soon here in the Southern Hemisphere and it's been all over the place

A long time ago, I heard that the reason the authorities don't like when you paint/draw on the street, is that most stuff used to paint/draw provides significantly less grip than asphalt, increasing the odds of an accident if a driver tries to turn or brake while over the painted/drawn area; and it often gets even worse if it rains

Just for your information the negative anomaly of the cold day 2 weeks ago was bigger than the positive anomaly of these "hot" days have been, so factually days like today is more close to what an average winter day should be than the freezing cold of 2 weeks ago, you guys should see the average temps from your place before using biased personal perception as facts, especially when your biased perception is clearly out of touch with reality
No, i love weather and cold, i just hate untrutfull bias being takens as true and circlejerk like this sub does every warm winter day, as i said, the cold days of 2 weeks ago are more unusual than this days have been

Best of luck to you guys in Belarus from Brazil
European countries need to seek the end of authoritarianism in old soviet countries
Lukashenko needs to fall along side Putin and others
The PM is the leader of the party that holds a majority in parliament (or of the party that leads a coalition in case there is no majority), so the ruling party can choose the PM if they are unhappy with the current leader or if the PM resigns during his term (which is how May got to power)
If the ruling party loses support from the parliament majority new elections are called

Thanks for pointing that out
I feel like people just take whatever graph confirms their opinion as the right one, even if they are smart
Also, saw someone suggest that the best graph would be "increase in deaths per capita", since that would account for misclassified cases (corona deaths being registered as pneumonia etc
) and for health care being too overwhelmed to take care of other health problems

*From Bordeaux in the Atlantic to Odessa in the Black Sea, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent
Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Northern Europe
Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Paris, London, Moscow, Copenhagen and Stockholm, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Potato sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Potato influence but to a very high and, in many cases, increasing measure of dependence from that tuber
* [*Amsterdam alone-the Netherlands with its immortal dikes-is free to decide its food security free from Potato dependence
*] *The Potato-dominated Parisian Government has been encouraged to make enormous and wrongful inroads upon southern France, and mass expulsions of millions of Occitans on a scale grievous and undreamed-of are now taking place
The Potato farmers, which were non-existent in all these Northern States of Europe before the discovery of the Americas, have been raised to pre-eminence and power far beyond their numbers and are seeking everywhere to obtain totalitarian control
Potato governments are prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in the Netherlands, there is no true food security

Yo y'all europeans really lucky lmao
Before J.F.K was assassinated he conjured a plan code named "Operation Brother Sam" to "prevent Brazil from becoming another China or Cuba". Brazil's president at the time, João Goulart, was left wing, which means everybody already thought he was a communist, including the folks at the CIA
Goulart also made the mistake of going to China, and that was all the proof anybody needed to say he was a communist, so Lyndon B. Johnson, gave the go ahead for the US Navy to support a coup d'état, which lead to the military dictatorship, when our military tortured, killed, kidnapped, exiled, and used warfare tactics against civilians, for over 2 decades
Most of the military went unpunished, because of the Lei de Anistia, which forgave the crimes of the military and the resistance of course that didn't help the resistance much, because most of them already had been killed
Years later those protections against the military where rolled back by President Dilma Rousseff, who was tortured during the dictatorship and was justifiably pissed
But the military operates by military law, not civil law
So basically the only people punished were those how had gruesome methods and didn't care for covering their tracks

I 100% agree with the Labour party that there should be a new general election, because  I think the Brits realised that voting conservative is a bad idea
right
Horrible
I 100% agree with the labour party that there should be a new general election, bc the brits probably learned that voting Conservative is a bad idea
right
Seriously, you guys haven't seen anything
Come to São Paulo
Believe it or not, money is not everything
Well just imagine all the problems that usually comes with big cities: traffic, violence, inequality, pollution
Now scale that to a city of 20 million people and add a pinch of Brazilian chaos

"Surely the words for lightning and power in Norwegian will look legit if I squeeze them together, right
I know about compound words, but you can see the difference between "officeofforeignaffairs" and "firewar", can't you

It was a poor example, I'll admit that

- French Connection isn’t actually French
- I always thought Dia, the supermarket chain, was Brazilian until I found out it was Spanish
God, those pictures of bus stops are what Heaven probably looks like
The "you stole our gold" thing at least here is just a meme (quite an overused and unfunny one, being honest)
People here barely talk about Portugal at all really
Our scapegoats to blame for the Brazilian poverty usually are our own culture (there is the belief among some of us that we are a country of thieves and liars), politicians and sometimes the USA for Operation Condor
Grimm (the TV series) does this to the most horrendous extent I've ever seen, at least in earlier seasons
Like, they legit make up words sometimes it seems

A Canadian posted about Canada's history so I might post some of Brazil's as well:
• [The Christie Question] that resulted in a formal apology from the British Empire to the Brazilian Empire
• [The Paraguayan War] the second most bloody war in the history of the Americas
• The Vargas' ["Estado Novo"] a totalitarian government that endured for 8 years in Brazil and that persecuted every single form of opposition: the Democrats, the Communists and even the Fascists
• [The Lobster War] the time Brazil and France went on the international court to avoid a war over, guess what, Lobsters
• [The 1964 Coup] that was backed by the Americans and installed a Military Junta in Brazil for 21 years
I do not sympathize with fascism or Nazism, but I have already read about this period in Austrian history and it's extremely interesting and a awesome scenario to imagine
The idea of a Social Democrat militia is just bizarre

Ah yes, because Spanish = south america = jungle

My mother's side of the family is of Italian origin, and if you see them "talking" over a Sunday meal, it looks like a scene taken from a comedy sketch
They just don't scream "MAMA MIA" because nobody learned Italian
To be fair, that triggers most people from the Americas nowadays
Because we had lots of people here before Columbus (or vikings or chinese) came, and the term "discover" is being rejected
>The thing that annoys us the most is thinking we are Spanish or that we speak Spanish
We get the same treatment here
Hahahaha
&#x200B;
> Also, sometimes brazilians will ask us to "give back their stolen gold".
That is mostly a joke, but I guess there are always dumb people
Sometime ago someone asked about that in r/asklatinamerica and I think we all agreed that it's been too long and asking for reparations nowadays make no sense
&#x200B;

I know you've celebrated your independence recently
Thank you
It was yesterday, although we don't have much to celebrate about right now

Just a question, Latin Americans are keen on gate-keeping when it comes to skin tone, 'colourism' as we call it, one of the shittiest legacies of colonization here
i love to read romanian texts and recognise some words (and some quotes too)

That's what triggers our local buffer state (Uruguay) the most too

>Most people in Brazil credits the airplane invention to [Santos Dumont]
>He is a huge source of national pride and was the first person to make a craft capable of full flight
The Wright brothers came afterwards and claimed to have flown earlier, but showed no evidence and their plane was not able to take off on its own, but they are given the credits for the airplane invention as they are American
Quoting from somewhere else in this thread
I'm reasonably good at geography, but I admit that sometimes I need to stop and think which one is which
There are some wild claims that the chinese would know about America in the XV century, but it's probably not true
I mean if you're all living in Denmark you're all immigrants, right
In Portugal's case, it's called "Iberian Peninsula" and I'm sure you can pick a fight with a Portuguese by calling it "Spanish Peninsula".
> colonisation of the Americas was a bit of a shit deal for the Indigenous population
When you look for "euphemism" in a dictionary they show this phrase
hahaha
I feel like brazilians struggle in the beginning with Portugal portuguese, but once you get used to the accent is pretty much the same language
I've never heard of any portuguese person having issues understanding brazilian portuguese
the lack of pluralization happens because of the italian immigration to brazil
Basically italians don't have the S plural in their words so the ones who went to São Paulo and southern states didnt speak quite well and this became part of the region accent
i totally understand your angry about it, but don't you think it's kind of great to have all this mixture in a language, like, this diversity (that problably wouldnt exist if portuguese is just spoke in portugal)
idk, the majority of slaves that went to brazil came from places like congo and ghana, and they went to other regions like RJ or northeast, but it could be as well
well, think about the US southern accent, some people from other english speaking countries might think it is just bad, but i think its fair to say that this isnt a good or bad matter
same with brazilian accent
i totally understand that speaking about communication to have all this diference between accents do worse the language, but this is how it works
Northern portuguese accent is very diferent from the Algarve one, which is very diferent from the Açores one, which is very diferent from the Angolan one, and so on and so on
This diference doesnt happen because of randomness
My point is that this happens with all languages, and while it might not be good to standardization, it shows how great this world can be and how languages can be a demonstration of culture and all diversity of cultures that exist
I can fairly understand until Middle English, but I'd say that being poetry makes it way harder than it should be I believe
Sometimes I struggle to read poetry even in my own modern language

People act like there would be a sudden decrease in productivity when we already waste a huge chunk of working hours on the internet or just not doing shit
The idea that you must stay in the office for 4 hours doing nothing after you finished your job for the day just because someone says you need to is just asinine
The idea is that you would keep the same pay as before, no one is arguing for less pay for minimum wage workers here

Los hermanos de Argentina
Umm Argentina maybe
Pelé > Maradona
Jumping on the " Non europeans are welcome to answer too
" But besides the obviousness that is Argentina and to some extent Uruguay, which many answered in r/asklatinamerica already, we have a sports rivalry with France and Germany, it doesn't need explanation, does it
And a "memetic warfare" rivalry with Portugal as well it seems
>!Sports rivalry with Netherlands and Belgium are kinda set aside because they weren't as shocking as 1998 and 2014
For Brazil: Argentina
We got over 7x1 after defeating Germany once, but losing to Argentina
We already have the most World Cups, so we almost take it as world cup<losing to Argentina
Yes, a healthy rivalry
>Doesn't snow that often during the summer
You're saying there's _less snow_ during the summer, instead of no snow

Would Swedish society accept this solution

I can't agree more
Not necessarily
League of Legends is a game that made the best use out of the loot box model imo
You can still buy 99
99% of what you want directly in the shop with no BS luck involved, but the loot boxes exist to give you a chance to earn stuff for free
They even let you buy stuff with the free currency for cheaper by using the loot system
It's honestly something I wish more games did, the concept behind loot boxes is not bad by itself, but the implementation most companies have found for it are god-awful
They pretty much are
Little Jimmies have been spending 100s of dollars/euros on TF2 hats or csgo skins long before people suddenly decided to crusade against lootboxes because now it's evil EA instead of Gabe Newell doing it
Card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon have had literally the same system but physically for ages as well, and they're not even cosmetic like most lootboxes, those are things that you actually need to play the respective games
Star Trek
It was a big thing for quite some time over on r/brasil, we still use it from time to time but not to the extent r/ich_iel does

Esperando alguém chegar aqui com uma língua românica obscura como o romanche, piemontês ou sardo
Algo que acho interessante é  que mesmo o catalão sendo uma língua ibérica, eu a considero mais difícil de entender do que francês. Deve ser provavelmente por causa da minha familiaridade com o inglês, uma língua com raízes no francês.
Relevante:
Me pergunto o quão similar é esse comentário ao português quando pronunciado
Eu entendi praticamente tudo, menos a palavra "spiegare".
Aquele sentimento quando você entende a mensagem sem enter quase nenhuma palavra
Only the context
Some very simple words like "est" and "tertiam" are telligible due to my familiarity to other languages(és from spanish and tertiary from English, respectively)
Interessante como vizinhança em italiano é mais parecido com português do que espanhol, ao menos na pronúncia

I sure hope the colony ones count otherwise it's Pedro
Now that's some variety

I would say any public project is a badly executed one, and I'm not even joking
The Portuguese word "saudade". It expresses a feeling I've never seen another word in another language to express it
That feeling when you feel someone's absence, remembers all the good times you spent with that person, whether you have that person around at that moment, is the pain of the absence of a loved one
It is the word with the most beautiful meaning I know and much of Portuguese culture is based on it
Can confirm, we seemingly brag about that word whenever someone starts talking about our language
It can also mean just missing someone, depends on the context
In Portuguese Cornelius would almost have "corno" as its root, which means "cuckold".
Brazil definitely needs a list like this
Wow, I didn't know EVE Online was developed in Iceland
Never actually played it but that game is huge
It was home to some of the largest ever virtual battles in history, like the Bloodbath of B-R5RB in 2014, which involved more than 7,500 online players and there's even a Wikipedia page about it
Iceland produces so many cool stuff with such a small population, it's mindblowing
Banjo-Kazooie, the Donkey Kong Country trilogy, GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark, Conker's Bad Fur Day, and every Rare gem there ever was
That's very impressive

Is that the case in all of Portugal
Here in Brazil the name for kite changes from region to region
I believe it's called papagaio in some places too, but in Rio it's called pipa or arraia depending on the type of kite
Was he wearing white shoes
Birds don't have teeth
Or a country who believes it's the center of the world
Yeah, it’s pretty common
I’d say doing such thing is definitely more common in countries like Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany though
I’ve heard a lot of people do it to buy goods if they live really close to the border
literally anyone except for the very dark-skinned africans and Indians
Everyone else may look Brazilian to me, we’re just too diverse
I just use Portuguese wikipedia to learn about Brazil
Everything else in English is much better
Not european but I think the answer fits and it's good enough to warrant a pass to me
In Brasil I've seen it called the Altar of the drunk, as drunk people will knee in front of it, but only in vomiting situations
In Brazil: The little throne

why is that
Were there any pros to communism
Or just cons
Legit question
i see
here in southern brazil garibaldi is also considered a hero for his achievements in the ragamuffin war, but we don't really know much of his participation in the unification of italy, i didn't know til now that he was to blame for the independence of san marino
btw, do you know if theres still some people in favor of an unification movement in italy/SM or the relationship between the two countries is really no matter at all
Thanks a lot
Considering it’s Iceland, I’m surprised you didn’t find out he was your cousin too

Portuguese speaker here, also know some spanish
French one: I understood what the [Titanic] was just fine, despite a lot more difficulty by the end of the paragraph
I can get the general meaning, but most words are unintelligible to me
Second hardest
Spanish: I also understood who [Mother Teresa] was in spanish absolutely perfectly, although i do speak spanish, just not very well, so it's not very fair
Italian: I now also have a general idea who [Cecilio Stazio] was, apparently some influencial writer of what appears to have been comedic teather plays in the Roman Empire
It wasn't quite as easy as spanish, but sure easier than french
Romanian: I could only understand that this orthodox
Monestary
Church
Temple
named [Mănăstirea Plătărești] was built ("construită" meaning "construida" is not hard to guess) betwen 1642 and 1646
not much more, though
Hardest to understand by far
Catalan: So apparently the [Sixth Avenue] is officially called "Avenue of the Americas", and has a both names on signs
I understood it about as well as i understood spanish, so they don't seem to be a very different language at all
As much difference as brazilian and european portuguese, in my eyes
Galician: Easiest to understand by a longshot
It's pretty much just a mix of portuguese and spanish, apparently
Considering i speak both of those languages (to drastically varying proficiencies), i understood what [titanium] is just fine
The Portuguese translations I have seen are pretty close to that
Few differences are that Baggins is "Bolseiro", which is bag-maker
Aye, forgot to specify that part
I thought every romance language did this with these kinds of movies/books tho, surprised Portugal is different in that regard
I just looked at a few pictures, but I Imagine it's just a bit hard to go around Rome using a car instead of public transport because it's a really old city
But then again, I imagine it's like that for a lot of places in Italy
I might be completely wrong
I can imagine how big of an asshole he is because you chose him instead of Putin

Not only it's funny with all it's quirkyness and british accent, it's also very democratic ! A constant back and forth debate set up in a confrontational manner
They don't have debates during election years, they have debates every week !
I wish our president came to answer questions from congress every week and congressmen could shout at the president
What's the context of this ?
>He is like that, the parliament's buffoon
Careful
He might become prime minister in the future
No one took Bolsonaro or Trump seriously before they were elected
But why did that guy brought flowers and lifted him by his crotch ? That was super weird
> He's from a Catalan separatist party
That's typical
Politicians like this are usually nationalists or radical of some form
Let's hope, but let's not underestimate him again
He is probably gonna win Florida
If he wins Pennsylvania, he's probably gonna win reelection
Acre doesn't exist/there's dinosaurs and the internet just made it there

One year ago I went to Ireland to a enhance my English and 6 months ago I came back to Brazil because of the pandemic (being close to my family and stuff)
It was a decision that I took too quickly, and I should have waited a bit more
I don't know if I will ever go back
I want, of course, but since I don't have any european passport I have to be enrolled in some course to have the permission to live and work 20h per week maximum, and that isn't quite easy way to live forever

It’s more of a British thing
I used to wear them but now I never have spare coins to buy one at school
Anyways, I heard it’s seen as a nationalistic symbol (sort of) and I don’t really stand for that
What do you mean
So they approve the shorter form in Czech, but not in English
We call the USA *the United States* here; the most used gentlic is *American*, though
I have a hard calling the country “Côte d’Ivoire” here: it sounds kind of pedantic
Lucky for me, the country does not come up often in conversations
Usage of the shorter name (*Tchéquia*) is not common here in Brazil
I don’t think it is weird, and I have used it for a while, but most of the times I end up having to explain the reason behind this different name to others
The change requested by the Netherlands (from *Holanda* to *Países Baixos*), though, is harder, especially because the new gentilic (from *holandês* to *neerlandês*) is too different from the new name
I left Prague with this impression
For instance, a tour guide was against an adoption of the euro for what seemed to be a preservation of part of the nation’s identity
You are correct, aside from the misspelling of *Chéquia*. It is just that Portuguese speakers are used to call it *República (T)Checa*, and it can be hard to change habits
Though competition with Brazil
And if they keep complaining you will also burn their car
The Germans might disagree
Argentina doesn't need this kind of rule
I didn’t know that
I just knew Penedo was a cool and well-sought-after touristic destination but not a single word about Finns founding the town
I’ll definitely move the town up some spots on my homeland‘s places to visit
Thanks
The mixture of indo European Portuguese and finno ugric Finnish makes up for a very unique combo
It’s sad it wasn’t recorded and documented as it should
It’ll be my pleasure, friend
Cheers
How odd
I wasn’t expecting that like *at all*. I’ve always thought PT-BR was easier to grasp but I definitely would never think it could resemble Savonian Finnish
I also must say I got a little envy of that Brazilian fella on the train mate
lol bc I’d have a blast to explain someone the difference between them and to speak something in a Portuguese accent and in a Brazilian accent for comparison
I’m really into languages and helping someone get the sound and feel of Portuguese language would be a great exercise for me and a lot of fun as well
Zinkzand sounds like a stereotypical german english accent

I think it's important to define who we are calling rich
Are we talking about doctor or CEO of medium/big company levels of rich
Are upper middle class people who own one or two nice cars and a modern home rich enough for the purposes this discussion
Infant Dom Henrique, founder of the magnificent Sagres school, would be extremely proud
Agree with my Mexican friend
And we can't forget the word "marreta" which means the same thing, but I think it is cooler
is that just for beer or do other drinks cost as much
I see an united EU kinda like the US in terms of language, technically the main language would be English because it's what most people speak, but no actual official language, and every region (Spain, France, Netherlands, etc) would still have their own language as the one you use to go to school to, deal with the government and such
You just couldn't have a country that would rule over so many different cultures and have them all adopt a single language, that would lead to insurrection and even independence-seeking rebellions extremely quickly
Speaking not as a Brazilian, but as a speaker of the most beautiful language in the world, the language of Camões and Fernando Pessoa: if even we, natives of the Portuguese language, we have enormous difficulties in understanding the grammar of our own language due to the huge number of exceptions and  details that we must memorize, why in this world would a German, for example, be able to study this language
He would fall into a fetal position crying when he see the verb conjugation lists and the infinity of verb tenses, he would go into despair at seeing the lists of rules of verbal conduct, adnominational adjuncts, complements, commas and accentuation
Sometimes many people take their entire school life to master this grammar
Some sounds, like the nasal ones, are a nightmare even for Spaniards: you have to use your nose to make a nasal sound without your tongue vibrating
This "blessed" sound is very common in the language and pronouncing it in the wrong way can get you into trouble
Whenever Europeans use English as a lingua franca, Dr
Zamenhof turns over in his grave
If the EU were to impose a lingua franca on the education system to reduce translation costs, Esperanto is the best alternative
In less than 6 months you will be fluent and word formation is extremely easy
Just memorize the suffixes, prefixes and radicals and you can say anything
The grammar is extremely regular and for those who like to travel, there is the Pasporta Servo network
By registering in it you get free hosting anywhere in the world where you have an affiliate as long as you are ready to welcome other members of the network into your home
Imagina só que maravilha os alemães tendo que decorar as nossas conjugações e regência verbais, regras da crase, tendo que discernir entre um complemento nominal ou um adjunto adnominal, saber as regras da vírgula
Até eu que sou nativo choro em posição fetal quando tento estudar gramática, imagina então os estrangeiros
Isso sem falar nas palavras homofonas e nas regras da ortografia
As escolas de idiomas iriam faturar muito dinheiro num mundo onde a língua mais bela do mundo, a flor do Lácio, é a lingua franca
A taxa de reprovação seria altissima
But we are talking about a common language for the European continent
Esperanto will fit like a glove
Cold: 10 - 15
Chilly: 15 - 20
Nice: 20 - 30
Warm: 30 - 35
Hot: 35+
Preach
Fucking hate sunlight and hot weather, had to be born in Brazil of all places
The last two are used here in Brazil as well (although mostly by older people), for obvious reasons
The Portuguese language is quite beautiful for saying silly shit
We are like your favorite child, right
I don't really share a lot of stuff about my country on my social media accounts because I believe that is usually reserved to news organizations
Seriously
I hate to be one of those "thoughts and prayers" people
I mean, I care about it, but then again, even if I put some effort writing about it, it's still "thoughts and prayers".
oh believe me, most of us also hate Brazilian dubs
but hey, look at the bright side: at least people don't think you speak Spanish xD
hey now, don't ruin my moment here ok
I guess that's something the Brazilian diaspora does
Anyway, I should point out that I'm probably in the minority
Brazilians are very active in social media
Pretty much every single scene in Fast Five
Oh, I know how it feels from the other side from talking to Europeans about distances
If I say a 4 hour drive is not long, I have Brits looking like they're about to put a crucifix to my face
Meanwhile, that's the time it took me to go to my grandma's house, and we only stayed for like a day and a half, two or three days if it was a holiday
You can literally get that from just looking someone up on Facebook
That's ridiculous
If the name for cookies is "biscoito" or "bolacha".
And of course it was one of Bolsonaro's minions
Man, I'm really fucking sorry the world has to deal with our shit
If we already act so fucking dumb in our current state, imagine if we had "fuck you, I do what I want" power like the US
I don't remember these lyrics for we didn't start the fire
Actually in Brazil these jokes would have the Portuguese on the receiving end, but i've heard that they switch it over to us, so idk
Why
All the riches Portugal took should have slingshotted the country into 2080

I saw your comment and tought that there must be a weird small region
Europe is not as advanced as a society as i tought before
This will only affect countries in the EU, right
I've been saying that for months
I'm sure there will be another end-of-the-internet fearmongering again in the near future and Reddit will make an obnouxious campaign on it and people will fall for it again
These people might actually be crying wolf
When an actual threat comes, nobody will believe it

Luiz Inácio Lula
Lula was a robber, and a corrupt, his wife said that he once said that he hated blacks, he said to our police that Hitler was a good person and never talk about making Brazil a good country, just his party and ideas
Bolsonaro is racist and homophobe, I also hate him, but Lula is a fucking disgusting traitor
Is there a saying in your country that refers to another nationality
When you are in a very bad situation, we here in Brazil use a saying to refer to this situation "I am more screwed than an Irish without potatoes". Does your country have a similar saying
>When you are in a very bad situation, we here in Brazil use a saying to refer to this situation "I am more screwed than an Irish without potatoes"
No, we don't. /r/quityourbullshit OP
I have never seen someone using that expression lmao but I will start using it bc its too perfect
Aqui no Brasil nós temos esse ditado também kkkk
Funny, we similarly use "Paraguayan" as synonym for "fake", because they actually sell tons of fake products, such as brand clothes, and lots of brazilians go to the border to buy them
We call it a turkish bath here in Brasil
Atualmente não é tão usado assim, mas já foi popular por aqui
Entao conta
Realmente, ela não é muita usada atualmente, mas usei ela como exemplo kkkkk
Maybe it's a "Spain isn't even a real country" kinda joke
Not my mother at least
She took 2 of my father's surnames and got rid of one of hers in the process
Me and my brother have 1 less surname than them because my mom was very superstitious at the time
I've never seen someone argue otherwise

Have a character that was born in one country but moved to the other with their family at a young age, and is caught in the classic "am I loyal to my homeland ot the place that made me who I am today
" conflict, while being seen as English to the French and vice versa
Then the story branches out depending on which side you choose, potentially riding along with Jeanne d'Arc or deciding whether she burns or is just imprisoned for example
Hell, you could take advantage of the fact that it was fought over such a long period of time and have a bunch of different storylines with different characters all throughout the different conflicts, playing both English and French nobles, but also peasants, knights, and merchants

This is how it works in portuguese too
Lately with all the attention non-binary people have been getting some have started using the letter "E" when gendering words (instead of the male O or female A)
Especially adjectives and pronouns
I get why they do it, but it just sounds weird
Same in portuguese
what is the most famous music from your country that is not the national anthem
Interesting how you include variations of vowels as separate ones
In portuguese we have á,à,â,ã,é,ê,í,ó,õ,ô,ú, but we only refer to aeiou as vowels
Huh, interesting
I thought they were just accents
TIL, thanks
Don't know if it counts (since I've never been in any of the countries cited), but, I've already realized that the French do not dress like those fancy people drinking coffee outdoor in a Parisian restaurant as you may see in movies, not all Germans are pale, blonde and blue-eyed, not all Italians are dark-skinned and brown-eyed like Sicilians nor look like Mario Bros, the average Portuguese do not look like Pedro Álvares Cabral, Finns are not Mongolic, the Scots do not wear kilts all the time, the English do not have weird teeth, not all Irish people are pale, have freckles and are redheaded, etc
Lol

I once ran an RPG session set in the far future where the human galactic feudal empire had 2 main languages: Hindu, which was the language of the lower classes, and a hybrid of German with Slavic languages, which was the language of the higher classes
I'm from Brazil
Just wanted to share my story
Here in the South of Brazil everyone knows what  "rapariga" means
No, not at all
The population of the African Portuguese-speaking countries (Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe) is growing very fast, and it is expected that the population of these countries together will easily surpass Brazil and Portugal, the current language centers
It is assumed that Portuguese will have around 500 million speakers by 2050, and will be the most widely spoken language in the southern hemisphere of Planet Earth
The same is true for French, where Congo today has more French speakers than France itself
So I am reassured
The average profile of the speakers of my native language will only change, Africans will keep the language alive for a long time to come
Before, the speakers of this language were mostly Portuguese and today the language is practically dominated by Brazilians
Now we will pass the baton and it will be the turn of the Africans to take the lead
And to top it off we have countries like Angola and Mozambique with a population that is growing very fast
What will happen is that the profile of the speakers of Camões' language will change a lot: first it was a primarily Portuguese language, then it was dominated by a Brazilian majority, and now we will see African countries (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe) having a Portuguese-speaking population larger than Brazil and Portugal combined
The same is true for French and we will see French, English, Arabic, and Portuguese as the dominant languages of Africa
From what I have seen, Portuguese is used in these countries as the lingua franca that allows communication between different peoples
In most cases, it is used as a second language, with the exception of the capital regions where the Portuguese presence was more present and the population of these regions use Portuguese as their main and first language
This is basically what happens in India: a European language is used to "connect" different peoples with languages from different families, but the populations continue to use their native languages at home, in the most intimate moments
P.S.: What happened here in Brazil was that the native indigenous population went through a genocide: either the populations that did not accept the Portuguese presence were killed by the Portuguese and their allies, or the populations that accepted the Portuguese presence mixed with the Portuguese colonizers through marriage and sex
This generated a huge mixed population, which we call here Mamelucos, children of Portuguese and Indians
These populations, including the Portuguese colonizers, adopted Tupi, one of the indigenous languages and used by the people who were allied with the Portuguese, as lingua franca, creating Nheengatu (also called modern Tupi)
Even the Portuguese elites spoke Tupi in daily life and only used Portuguese for official events
These are two different cases: the colonization of the African countries was done in a system where the Portuguese went with their entire families and did not mix, in the case of Brazil, as the technology was more rudimentary, only the men came and they got together with the native women (obviously, if you are a man you can understand their situation: they would leave an extremely Catholic and conservative country with extremely coy women and no habit of bathing to arrive in a country full of beautiful women, naked, clean and shaved after having spent months in dirty places full of men, only having masturbation to relieve sexual tension
What would happen next is extremely predictable, they would either beg the captain to make alliances with the natives or unfortunately resort to rape, having children mixed up in both situations as a result)
Ah yes, [the legendary portuguese dub]

Nope, its very very very uncommon

Nationalism will be the biggest challenge we'll be facing the next following years
It doesn't matter the country, every place is the same rhetoric and narrative
EDIT: My point on nationalism is not a criticism on our love for the place that we belong, but to these right wing/populist politicians that use that kinda of love that we had to close the doors of comunication between nations by attacking other natiions or creating old tensions
We reached a point where most of the countries in the World had gained independecy due to nationalism, but it dated very bad today
We don't need it anymore
Welp, the Summer is going to end soon here in the Southern Hemisphere and it's been all over the place

A long time ago, I heard that the reason the authorities don't like when you paint/draw on the street, is that most stuff used to paint/draw provides significantly less grip than asphalt, increasing the odds of an accident if a driver tries to turn or brake while over the painted/drawn area; and it often gets even worse if it rains

Just for your information the negative anomaly of the cold day 2 weeks ago was bigger than the positive anomaly of these "hot" days have been, so factually days like today is more close to what an average winter day should be than the freezing cold of 2 weeks ago, you guys should see the average temps from your place before using biased personal perception as facts, especially when your biased perception is clearly out of touch with reality
No, i love weather and cold, i just hate untrutfull bias being takens as true and circlejerk like this sub does every warm winter day, as i said, the cold days of 2 weeks ago are more unusual than this days have been

European countries need to seek the end of authoritarianism in old soviet countries
Lukashenko needs to fall along side Putin and others
The PM is the leader of the party that holds a majority in parliament (or of the party that leads a coalition in case there is no majority), so the ruling party can choose the PM if they are unhappy with the current leader or if the PM resigns during his term (which is how May got to power)
If the ruling party loses support from the parliament majority new elections are called

*From Bordeaux in the Atlantic to Odessa in the Black Sea, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent
Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Northern Europe
Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Paris, London, Moscow, Copenhagen and Stockholm, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Potato sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Potato influence but to a very high and, in many cases, increasing measure of dependence from that tuber
* [*Amsterdam alone-the Netherlands with its immortal dikes-is free to decide its food security free from Potato dependence
*] *The Potato-dominated Parisian Government has been encouraged to make enormous and wrongful inroads upon southern France, and mass expulsions of millions of Occitans on a scale grievous and undreamed-of are now taking place
The Potato farmers, which were non-existent in all these Northern States of Europe before the discovery of the Americas, have been raised to pre-eminence and power far beyond their numbers and are seeking everywhere to obtain totalitarian control
Potato governments are prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in the Netherlands, there is no true food security
