I vividly remember being charged 100 liras for a 10 minute trip in Istanbul when I visited there
and that was three years ago when one lira is still worth 2 CNY/0
3 euros
After that I just stick to public transportation all the time
I understand the middle english snippet perfectly
I understand each sentence in the early modern english snippet, but can't connect them together
Can't understand one bit of old english

Reddit has a really hard time seeing where the ball is moving due to the fact that people cannot see beyond their front yard
As such, the ideas that people love (banning straws) are, frankly, performance art as opposed to actual good policy
Here's some hard facts: the median human being is a Chinese farmer subsisting on $8 per day
That means there are appx ~4B to 5B people today who have yet to enter what westerners would consider to be lower/middle class
Therefore, over the next 100 years, we will see appx 1B chinese people, followed by ~1
5B Indian people followed by about 2B Africans enter the lower/middle class (plus another ~1
5B sprad out over 'other' countries/regions) - as the populations grow
But what happens when people enter the lower/middle class
Their carbon intensity goes up by 100x to 1000x (depending on who you listen to)
They start eating meat, they start driving cars, they require on-demand/stable electricity, they buy air conditioners
etc etc etc
And there is no way that Greta Thundberg (sp
) is going to 'flight shame' 5 billion Chinese/Indians/Africans into not entering the middle class
That's just stupid
And for one second, pretend you're an indian subsistence farmer: are you really gonna listen to a eurpoean, who is wealthy beyond your dreams, when they tell you that you can't enjoy prosperity b/c of some invisible sky gas that you can't even see
Of course not - you want air conditioning so you dont die the next time the heat goes above 110F.
So the real answer is not what people are suggesting here, as its largely performance art (banning straws, flight shaming, shaming CEOs, OMG the Amazon is burning - pls share
) - all that stuff feels good and it require minimal thought to express on Twitter but it achieves next to nothing
The real answer is that we need to be dedicating massive resources to re-directing the path of economic development, such that ~5B people can industrialize without (dramatically) ramping up their carbon intensity
So we need improved solar/battery tech, stable electric cars coupled with stable, large scale power generation, etc etc etc
TL;DR: we need to redefine the very concept of economic development
It's very sad to think that just over a year ago people were joking about the commie coof here on Reddit
FUCK YOU FUCCCKkK AAAAAAAAAAAA FUCK YOU AFUCKKKKKKKKKKK AAAAAAAAAA FUCKIN GUCK FUCKK AAAAAAI FELL FOR FUCKIN oMG FUCKIN FUCK FUCKINGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Kosovo is a thing

Kosovo’s borders

Context is king Reddit, you are seeing shadows in the dark
Was it really the Nazis that were responsible
It's all cause an effect that  begins from roots of humans evolution
Hungary
Always remember that we humans are the intruders~ Good job hog
Translations like these are based on machine learning that mimics the language it sees
It makes these assumptions because when these words are paired when humans use it these are the English gendered pronouns that people use the most often
Edit: A much more problematic aspect of ML are recommendation engines, which can reinforce and even create preferences for users as they interact with it over time
A human translator would have to make the same guess Google translate is doing here
Yeah, but in this particular case, there is no context
A human cannot have a better guess than a machine
The entire world has denounced Harald Hardrada for his cool sense of humor
It’s ridiculous to think somebody would feel threatened by trade from the start
It's a good thing or bad thing explain
No one mentioned nameless king seriously
check the boss fight building
Short answer is yes
You can guess in dark souls, which is a Japanese game, the nameless king is first son of Gwyn, he don’t agree with his father and ally himself with the dragon, sworn enemies of Gwyn
So Gwyn made him a taboo and banish him from history
Miyazaki, the game director, intended to show nameless king as “Exotic”, “Powerful”, “Rebellion”, “The-lost-glorious-empire-and-tenet” that kind of feeling
That’s exactly how I feel when I saw giant Mosques from Turkey
I was thinking, they once ruled the world, and created a beautiful unique culture different from classical Europe
That fits the lore of nameless king and Dark Souls perfectly
By the way, Turkey is one of most popular travel destinations for Chinese
The French also, considering how much heat butter packs
As an Asian watching this, it's entertaining
Actually that is how English works
things are contextual
As VERTIKAL said, if you were discussing American bases in Europe, the established context dictates that it's appropriate to just call it the "German base
The infamy and importance of World War II and the Holocaust pretty much means that the established assumption and context is always there
Nobody before this recent debacle took "Polish death camps" to mean anything other than that
In fact, it's not even a term I've heard
It sounds like a non-problem caused by people who want to have something they can attack as a strawman
Languages are based on communication
Given that English speakers can come to a consensus on the implicit meaning associated with the phrase, then yes, that's fine
That is how languages work in fact
Just because your language is different doesn't mean that we should adjust English to fit Polish

“And by Europe I don’t mean Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, or the Belarus
No, I mean this 5 million population oil producing country shall represent all of Europe” -r/Europe
Did the US just ban abortion
Because “Europe” did
Imagine not being able to read the third sentence of the title, were the rather benign euro-patriotism turns to nationalism
Strange how people get so triggered when the cherry picking goes the other way
“Poland abortion: Top court bans almost all terminations”
“Poland abortion: Top court bans almost all terminations”
Super zen my dude
Merry Xmas to you
More Europeans in Poland than all of Scandinavia
Poland is part of the EU
The EU certainly hasn’t done anything about it
They certainly tolerate this
Orban is a European dictator in the EU
So “Europe” has a dictatorship
But in the real world it hasn’t happened
So Hungarian politics is a part of European politics and is a dictatorship
But haha look at the Norwegians in sweaters, Europe is great US bad
They’ve already taken over in various European countries
They won’t in the US
Did you miss the 2020 elections
And
they didn’t? What guys with guns were marching in 2016
Maybe the US will have been taken over by a dictator like Orban when you wake up
I don't think it's based purely on GDP because in Greece, Thessaloniki ranks lower than Crete or the Peloponnese
Make the Balkans bowsers castle
TIL I am a spiritual Finn
That he’s Chinese
The Mongolian Empire is actually the Chinese Yuan Empire, and the Mongolian history is actually just Chinese history
The CCP claim to “Outer Mongolia” was forfeited in the early Cold War, and this is prepping for another “historical claim” on China’s border
Say Hi to Phimosis
Typical ubisoft servers
Then Russia comes over and flattens everything
Bright Materialists + 25
[Or hiring them to be your bodyguards]
He was a pussy traitor
Considering the situation the last time Polish tanks were advancing through Germany, this is a wonderful turnaround of historical import
Latvia looks rather dead
Greece pay your debts
>Well, I was on my way to this gay Gypsy bar mitzvah for the disabled when I suddenly thought "Gosh, the Third Reich's a bit rubbish
I think I'll kill the Fuehrer
" Who's with me
Russia has the deadliest school attack ever though
Why does Norway have so many
I knew albania would come in handy one day
China didn’t broadcast blasphemy which if you noticed isn’t okay for Muslims, for you Westerners concentration camps are worse since you also believe we gas them like Nazis
Nah they’re getting their shit beat out of them like every other form re-education in China
The Hui people are not getting beaten into re-education
They’re also Muslims
Why’s that
It’s because Chinese have no problem with religion as long as you don’t try to stab people to death or are a front for independence movement
If you do then you and your people are getting the stick
It’s just how China deals with malcontents even if million innocents have to get beaten into submission
I wish that wasn’t the case but Chinese don’t do human rights like you guys do
How so
Hui people and Muslims in China still all participated in their Eid festives and traditions and their worship is not in any way forbidden
Except of course Uighurs since you know they stabbed people to death
This is a ethnical issue not religious
Since Turkey has been fuming at China non stop
Doesn’t mean we won’t beat the shit out of them until they stop being extremist
Why would their people harbor extremists if they’re peaceful
Please tell me how getting terrorist attacked like France forever is acceptable without a reaction
China is authoritarian, we beat the shit out of you if you act up
Muslim leaders have been to these camps
You think they believe you guys who bomb them all the time
Doesn't show hypocrisy just they made their own conclusion since your media is not as trustworthy as you think they are
Not saying that Chinese media is trustworthy either, but making your own case works better over believing what Americans are brewing up
Turkey has funded terrorism in Xinjiang forever and Erdogan has been on attack mode also forever, of course you don't know since terrorist attacks in China is okay to you guys lol, I remember that French journalist who said it was just a reaction to Chinese suppression
Suddenly no more problems in China after camps who knew you can solve terrorism if you attack the source
Am I missing something
aren't there already pan-european unis, like  the College d'Europe

This is such a wholesome thread :)
I'd like to move ASAP, perhaps to an European country
Seeing as HK was a former British colony, perhaps I'd move to the UK
If only it was still in the EU
This made me laugh way harder than I should've
Oh my she speaks like a machine gun

That's so interesting, I would've thought the opposite
Should've told all that to the Spanish speakers so they can rename their sons Jiisus
WE SHOULD RAID THE BASTILLE !!
Wait
What ? The French did it already ?
WE SHOULD RAID THE REICHSTAG !
Wait
The soviets did it ?!?!
WE WILL RAID MOSCOW !!
Uhhhhm
you are the German
Do we have enough budget to raid at winter for the troops at the front
Let's play a game ..
Who's the next dictator to invade Russia
Yes lol
Go bCk to Moscow
China is OK
Yes
That what they said back in 1912 :(
Been there ...
The Christmas truce
It was 1914 , I proof checked just now
Compulsory not European
But my major in college did require us to study in France for a year
I went to a big enough city, but I heard from a year before me that someone went to Quimper
There's a lot of Americans going to Greece on their study abroad
But it's not Erasmus so they wouldn't be at the Greek universities, nor learning Greek
They usually get put into the American colleges or have an American professor come and teach them while they're all in Greece together, like in College Year Athens
Communist
Labour reform
Mentally and physiclally
Whatever ricegum did
How is that a Drink's name ? Obviously is a Activity for little kids
Actually in poorer countries, wealthy people flex much, much more
Think India, Nigeria, Mexico, etc
Wealthy people from those countries drive their gold Porsches around the slums of their capital cities, and order high-end luxury products from London/Paris to be hand-delivered on the next chartered flight over
It's the wealthier European countries where everyone tries to look middle class
Also sorry I didn't realise this is AskEurope until I already typed out my response but
well, I hope it contributes something
Yup
So that’s what Danish criminals do for a living
Crushing People with tanks

Many foreigners find it too intimate, especially us Asian, but I don’t have a problem with it, I just think that it’s a public health disaster
It feels like when one person has a cold, half of the town will get it by the end of the week
That, or I’m just a total public health freak after SARS
Visited Naturalis once but was quite disappointed
a beautiful building but had a little bit too little to see in terms of specimens compared to other natural history museums I have visited before (London, Belgium, Singapore, Paris),despite the size of the museum building
But I agree it’s a really fun place to take your children to, they had some interesting exhibitions for kids
How much does it cost there
A whole rabbit (1
5kg) imported from your country is 100 euros which seems really expensive
Czech republic and Slovakia
Can I copy your homework ?
Sure
Basically the other kids Copied their homework and that is Scandinavia
With a but of stars and stripes
Czech flag will become the Filipino flag
