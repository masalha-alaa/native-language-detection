Holocaust games are my favourite
You can obliterate one race and replace it with pizza,  which one would you choose
When our idiot leader Enver Hoxha decided to end all of our alliances and make us isolated
He then proceeded to make a shit ton of bunkers in case someone wanted to attack us for some unknown reason
Breaking a truce with the ottomans because the Pope is organizing a Crusade with Skanderbeg in charge of it
Then pope dies soon after  and nobody decides to help you
Honorable mention : “Communism” ? Yea we’ll give that a try
It really depends
My family looks at it as a horrible point in history
I have plenty of friends who also told me the same thing
But there are a few “traditional” families that think he was great
Some do it ironically, others have a whitewashed memory
My father was in the military at the time and he tells me all the shit he would say and it’s just as corrupt as you would expect a poor communist nation to be
I hope that answered your question
Edit: I do not speak for all Albanians
I blame the gipsies after reading this
Happy to help :)
More like a true European or at least a true Balkans person
We’re all kinda the same in that aspect unfortunately
I had a problem on finding what especially meant in my language today i freaking forgot the word xd
Fier in Albania
Is totally convert with smog and bad small from the canals that are open
Usually people who has to cross Fier drive like crazy because of this mix
Ah yeah and full of prostitution and robbers
"Had to walk all the way here
" No reliable transportation in Albania
We have about 2 bunkers per square km
Which sucks but some of them are now used as other things like shops or mini art galleries for graffiti
Albanians eat the most fruit per person in Europe
I think it’s something like 3~ apples a day per person if it’s based on weight alone
I do believe we are the largest exporter of chrome (as in the metal) in Europe but I’m not sure if that’s still true
The Albanian language has no roots to other languages
While we do borrow plenty of words from other languages, the origin is the same
We managed to qualify for the Euros for the first time in 2016
Still stoked about that lol
Thank you German stranger
I’m currently learning German in school
Hopefully to become fluent in the coming years
I love your language
I still can’t understand any Bavarian though
Clichè, Touchè, Niche, Vouch the first time I heard these words I was baffled
They don't even sound English to me
Disrespect the law and you disrespect me
Some stupid people are still upset about ww2 but I don’t encounter many people who are anti-German
If anything it’s the opposite
After all, it’s like every two people in this country strive to own a Mercedes
I’m actually minoring in German myself
I don't think this is even a thing
Like i have never heard anyone say "don't sit next to him he's german". That's stupid
Wait sauna isn't Italian
It sounds so very Italian
Some of these are really hard but the ones with -uo- are definitely Finnish, since I've barely ever encountered them in my whole years of knowing Italian
Would actually love to see who guesses the most right and what foreign languages they know (obviously Italians and Finns aren't allowed)
Most cities other than the capital drink tap water and wouldn't even think about buying
Tirana though has really bad quality of tap water and most people buy bottled
Especially when they the are above your head and look at you
Albanians are number one in Europe for fruit consumption per capita
I forgot the exact weight it was but it’s equivalent to like 3 apples a day per person
I think it comes down to how the other person feels about it
I have Serbian friends and we occasionally talk about the history
We have a running inside joke that we’ll try to kill each other
At the end of the day, it was our governments that did these things
You can’t blame single individuals for the history
It’s like blaming a German right now for being a Nazi simply for the history
The diet
Because the poorer countries are situated in Southern Europe and along the Mediterrean, people are exposed to different kinds of fresh food
Not only it is a rich diet, but also the quality is quite high
Meanwhile in Germany people tend to rely on meat products and less on fruits or vegatables
The morther you go, the more you will notice that the olive oil becomes less present
As you mentioned lonliness, it is not uncommon and it is part of the mentality as well, that the kids never leave the house even after becoming adults or getting married
This means that the elders are always surrounded by other people and in case of a stroke they have a better chance to survive because they get help faster
While living alone and experiencing a stroke has nearly zero survival rate
The weather
Being exposed to sunlight for at least 250 days of the year is really healthy
Not only weather is related to agriculture but also to the natural vitamin D in our skin
This way the kids will grow up with an ideal physical system
My mind went directly at this:
That’s normal for Mediterraneans
Nordics on the other hand eat dinner at 5
Për shumë vjet Krishtlindjet
My parents wouldn’t threaten based on wage
They usually compared based on effort
“Do you want to build homes or work in a farm under the sun
Well, get the education and you can work in a cool building where the the only parts you move are your hands and mouth
Multiple people have asked me if we have electricity and/or running water in Albania
Albanians are born with a cigarette in their mouth and are usually holding a bottle of Raki
In my country, ironically, the award goes to the capital city
[Tirana] by all means looks as if a 5 year old kid played Sim City in real life and placed the buildings everywhere like mushrooms by destroying the trees and the historical sights, and then built some roads
The whole country except maybe Tirana and Southern Riviera ( during the summer)
In 1997, Albania had a (kinda) civil war that was sparked by Ponzi schemes
Albania, at the time, had just changed from socialism to a democracy
By Jan
of 1997, the Albanian citizens at the time lost $1
2 billion ($400 per person)
This lead to protest after protest
In the 1996 election, the Socialist Party lost to the Dem
Party by a large margin and the Socialist Party rejected the results
Another election took place on October of that month, and the same result came
The Soc
Party rejected it again
This also played a role in the “war”.
To add, at the time, the Northerners (Ghegs) and the Southerners (Tosks) had tension
The North supported Berisha (Dem
Party) and the South supported the Socialist Party
There were more things that contributed, but the lost is too long to write
It got international attention, including peacekeeping operations (Italy sent 7,000 soldiers, France 850, Greece 803 soldiers, Turkey 500, Romania 400, Germany 100 and Austria 100 soldiers
It all ended in 2300-5000 wounded and 2000-3800 dead
After all of this, Berisha was voted out of power, and the Socialist Party elected Reixhep Meidani into power
Albanian has 36 letters or alphabet and we write how the word sound to us even names
For example: Friedrich Nietzsche ~ Fidrih Niçe
William Shakespeare ~ Uilliam Shekspir
Pizza ~ Pica
We are one of the only countries in the world that uses only renewable energy
Well , strangely 3 hours coffee breaks is something common in the balkans
Well , there is no country that has oil and choose not to sell it
But saying we are one of the least renewable countries in Europe is simply not true
Albania share of renewable energy in final energy consumption is around 40-50% while other countries like sweden 50-60% and Italy , France , Germany etc use around 10-20%.
Edit - the data i found aren't the most recent but they should give the general idea
I write it the first way
However, my handwriting is so bad that it kinda looks like a line and it’s almost indistinguishable from my n, m, and u.
Edit: Line not lime
Our politics will just give you a headache, im glad you guys dont have to see it on your news
That’s exactly the same here
I swear everyone smokes
And they start pretty young too
A lot of times, it’s a sign of disrespect if you turn down a cigarette
In almost any language except maybe Czech and English you are known like that
In Albanian it's "Çekia".
I think, I think you are not the only one
I would say the murder of many men of faith (doesn’t matter which religion) during communism
...Well not just men of faith
A lot of people were sent to labor camps or sentenced to death for bs reasons during those times
I would love to hear someone from San Marino about this
You’re not invited in the Balkans cook out anymore
Wait, what
Where does that come from
Hoxha most probably
Not really
Climate wise and nature wise, I love it
Sand beaches, rocky beaches, mountains, rivers, lakes, etc
Besides that it sucks
Too many wars
Geographically I’d say we have it pretty nice
We have both mountains and beaches
Plus if I want to leave the country for a vacation I’m very close to Italy, Greece, and Dalmatia (and other locations of course)
*"Mbledhje me drejtorin"* \-> *Attend a meeting with the director*. It kinda works for both taking a dump and taking a leak, as it is not specific for one or the other
Another funny thing I noticed is that in some languages they use *"laying the cable"* for defecating, but in Albanian we use that to mean you're about to have intercourse
It is common for the older generation but not for the youngsters
You were kinda cool in '80s and '90s to get wasted in raki but nowdays not anymore
People tend to drink to socialize (like lets go have a drink and a nice conversation) rather than to get drunk
In Albania i remember doing my homework under candle light
10-15 years ago
That was in Tirana
Now it's a rare occurrence but I guess it happens a lot more in the villages, especially during winter
Food rations haven't been a thing since late 80s-very early 90s, when communist regime fell
The others are true but it's getting better, i guess
Although we've been stagnating under the current government
Same here
There are some words that are borrowed from Turkish but apart from that knowing just Albanian doesn’t get you far
No but the old call them with other names
While I personally measure the Road from A city to B city by saying that to go there you need to listen 36 songs by 3 min
A small Byrek place should be available everywhere outside the Balkans
Kosovo for obvious reasons
Other than that idk
I can say we have many similarities with Greece and other Balkan countries as a super dysfunctional family
Well, obviously it would be Kosovo, but that is pretty given
Other then Kosovo, it’s really hard to say since we’ve been stabbed in the back by most of our neighbors lol
Most Albanians would say Croatia since we’ve had a similar history
Also Italy maybe
Lolllll I was going to say Greece but I felt like I was going to be attacked by nationalists
We are both native Balkaners and have lived next to each other for so long
You guys are definitely worthy of the Qifsha Ropt award
I'm Albanian and I think that older flag is definitely better, the coat of arms is incorporated into the flag in a nice way, instead of just kinda being plopped in there
It’s not common to ask for help for things like rent
But if you have a decent job and still live with your parents it’s common to just help out
I don't think someone should have children if you think children are somehow obliged to "return the big favor
" to you afterwards
Thank you bulgaria for hating serbia
Aghhahahahhahahaha
>hateful like albanians
GHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH MY SIDES
Have you ever wondered by we albanians might be hateful
GAHHAHAHAH you will laugh the moemnt you understand why
Nah m8 we only hate you and greeks for fun
You sont see us going around saying kill the serbs(beside some Kosovo people who lost their families cuz of you)
We are chill me macedonia, montenegro , croatia
Bulgarians dont give a fuck about us, same for bosnia and romania and slovenia
While you, are hated by everybody besidesbmontenegro
Albanian:
Xhon meid his uei tu a tavern thru dhë dark forest, onli tu faind aut dhat hi forgot dhë mani
Ai rili lajk dhis kaind of diskashjons, uai dont ui rilaunç dhis sab: /r/JuropijanSpeling
(I really like this kind of discussions, why don't we relaunch this sub: /r/JuropijanSpeling
Xhoni meid his uei tu ë tavern thru dhë dark forest , onli tu fajnd aut dhet he frogot dhë mani
In “Albanian”:
Gjon mejd hiz uej tu ë tavërn thru dhë dark forest, onlli tu fajnd aut dhet hi forgot dhë mëni
I read it over again with an Albanian accent :P
Hi* forgat*
There are small variations among the different albanian phonetic transcriptions here but I think you are the first one who used Gj instead of Xh for *__J__*ohn :)
Just noticed that while going through comments haha Xhon is probably more accurate in this context but I didn’t even consider it in the moment
"I'm a giant fucking slut for history", sorry just hadn't ever heard it put that way
Not rude but saying “are you sure
” after someone has already answered sounds very condescending in Albanian
If its a competition we are first
Its not an argument just a fact
In Albania, there is a fictional place called Democratic State lol
Shark in albanian is peshkaqen, which literally translates to "a fish or a dog
For me the Swedish Despacito is defineatly Basshunter's "DoTA"
I’m gonna reach a bit and even tho the research wasn’t done in Albania, Ferid Murad came up with the fundamentals of Viagra
He shared a Nobel prize for his discovery
> Murad's key research demonstrated that nitroglycerin and related drugs worked by releasing nitric oxide into the body, which relaxed smooth muscle by elevating intracellular cyclic GMP
Tesla spinning in his grave
Still better than having a grown ass man reading the subtitles in the background like they do it in Poland
If you think normal movies are bad with that voiceover, try an erotic movie
I’ve been lucky enough to run across one
It’s hilarious to say the least
[Polish Lektor]
I’d like to thank all the neighbors for sending money and aid after the earthquake :-)
It's definitely a thing in Albania as well
It’s not taboo at all, they are widely hated (except by few nostalgics who did well oppressing others and want to go back to those golden times), it’s more that there has been so much secrecy and fuck uppery from that system, we don’t know where to begin to shit on them
You can say whatever you want, there are people who openly support him and nobody cares
English, not like I have a choice
[Gërdec] Arms disposal plant
The depot full of communist era ammunitions were also mentioned in “War dogs”.
First of all, snails are delicious
Second, Croatia (Dalmatia) and Greece get all this traction about having beautiful beaches but I feel like we are left out for some reason even though Albania has beautiful beaches (and other natural beauties)
Yes sir, this man right here
Me 2
We absolutely do not mind
Copying someone's accent is actually frowned upon around here
If we have trouble understanding some words, both sides know how to speak the standardized language and will switch to it
I’m just gonna be straight up
Why do Serbians still deny the actions of their past government, and still support crooked politicians from the 90s?
Also, why can’t an Albanian post about their country without you guys commenting “Kosovo je Srbja”?
That's why American girls are easy,  but also you'll be dead in 5 months from an std
Screw Albanian women, much cleaner and sexier
I would say Italian because is more spread in all Albania but also south speak a lot of Greek due to easy access in Greece
English is something that enter lately and slower than Italian
Here in Albania second language is Italian and besides I would add Greek and probably Macedonian and Gypsy
popular in informal discussion but still some intimidating when is the moment to include the issue in other level
Most reasons why people immigrate to the EU is for better economic conditions (among others)
Of course it can be work related reasons, or some people just don't like their home countries
But I just don't see why British people would care too much about immigrating, considering the already high conditions they live in
From experience, the Brits are xenophobic people who dislike having to learn another language to adapt to the work conditions of x country
Hard question
Oldest I would say Hungary but we fucked it up during communism when relations went cold and they haven’t gotten to where they were since then
USA I believe is the one friendship that is strong in the minds of people now
Umm can we be friends ?
I mean we’ve never had beef . Have we ?
Lol kinda unexpected for us to beat the shit outta italy but anyway where do you live I’ve got some cousins and friends over in italy
It is really mixed with groups and areas
For example in Northern Albania, people generally have witty punchlines based on anecdotes or one liners and have theatrical notes because of the artistic scene
In Southern Albania people near the seashore have a large influence from the Italian culture, and use a heavy sarcasm about everything
It has become like a way of acceptable manner to say the opposite of the meaning you intend to
In other places it is basically a smartass humor which is quite cringy
Among the youngsters humor sense revolves around snob or dumb humor and lots of innuendos
Generally the adults have a sense of humor based on the communist influence or the "checkmate" phrases
The admirative mood of the past tense in imperfect, is used mainly for a comical and an exaggerated situation
Hyperbolism is a key element in our sense of humor as well
Also we don't like pranks, offensive jokes or dark sense of humor in general and call them "shaka pa kripë", which means jokes without salt, because they lack taste just like a dish without salt
I'm not even interested in my own country's politics anymore
I do see how Kosovo's doing from time to time though
We have around 50-60 political parties every election but only the same 4-5 win seats in the parlament with 80% of the seats going to 2 major parties
We have a single first name and the father’s surname
However, traditionally we would have every middle name of our forefathers
So a traditional name would be (First Name) (Father’s Name) (Grandfathers Name) (Keep going down the family tree) (My Surname)
But legally most people just have first and last names
Apparently the current Royal family is descended from his nephew since he didn't have any heirs
Do you support their independence
Thanks to the movie "Taken" no doubt, many people assume Albania is this mafia-infested country, when in fact, the term "Albanian mafia" generally refers to people of Albanian descent in that line of business who 'operate' outside of the country
Hence, one will be kindly surprised to find no mafia whatsoever in the country itself
Sometimes
Sometimes it's the mafia, or other nationalists
Or just a band of worried locals
Not public schools
Certain private schools do, and they're f(o)unded upon theat purpose
You can add for Britain that you had a guy fighting in WW2 with a long bow and a sword
[Mad] Jack Churchill
[Albanian riviera] by far, as it is a mix of both crystal-clear pebble beaches and historical sites such as castles, old cities etc
Lately the [northern region] has also grabbed the tourists' attention, mainly due to the national parks and hiking trails
I **may** be able to name all the 50 states (or 40 at worst), but I honestly know shit of fourth fifths of the states in the US
Im a native Albanian speaker and still can't figure out some of the grammar .
German but not because of the language but because i dont have that much time to study it’s never ending rules
Matlab for me
Don’t u dare telling me that’s not a language
It would be a pretty cool movie
All things considered its not too bad but i never use it seeing as i can speak English perfectly
Yes
At least in my city (Shkoder)
You can go into a bar and ask for a glass of water without buying anything
If you know the barman, you can fill the glass yourself
You must eat you look like a stick
If you sit around all day your ass will get fat and conjoin itself
Stop staring at your phone your eyeballs are coming out
Dress up you look like a bat
I use “Zemer” (literally “heart” but used for close affection, usually a spouse or loved one) for my closest of friends
For other friends I usually go with “Vlla” (Brother) or the Kosovar method and called them “Breh” (Bro)(Since I’m not from Kosovo, this is more like an inside joke to copy those from Kosovo)
More distant friends I can just say “Shok” (friend)
Bre means bro
Are you sure
You’re right my bad
I do use it like bro since it sounds similar
Gjergj Elez Alia, the mythical warrior who fought off the evil Bajloz, who stands for the Slavic invaders
Skanderbeg wasted the Turkucks Armies all by his own forces only the madlad
A fun fact about Sweden is that together with Norway and Finland we have systematically seeked to assimilate and wipe out the entire population of the Sami people
We have taken their land, denied even basic rights like schooling in their own language, denied them jobs, exiled them from their own lands and even forcefully sterilised them
Nobody even mentions them and this discrimination and erasure of identity largely continues unimpeded even today
Lol, that is so true
Albania here
I guess tourism is veeery cheap compared to popular destinations such as Italy, France and Greece, to name a few
With an European salary you can practically enjoy a luxurious holiday in the Albanian Riviera and Alps region with half or even less the expenses elsewhere in Europe
Yeah
I can get a full Suflaçe (Albanian Gyro) for a little more than a dollar at many open shops by the beach
muti in albanian means "shit"
The insane over use of “ë”
Also, I love that we have 2 main distinct dialects that are both beautiful
Finally, the fact that it is unique but still is an Indo-European language
Great game I might add
There are 3-letter settlements like Kuç (more than one named this way), Laç, Val, Zall, Luz, Qarr, Gjaz, Suk, Gri, Kam, Pac, Çam, Sul, Rov, Sheh, Kus, Hot, Tuç, Xeth, Reç, Luf, Ukth, Pog, Xhan, Ças, Kir, Vig, Mes, Kaç, etc
The shortest at the same time only 2-lettered settlement is called **Qa**.
Candidates for shortest ones are arguably *Ujë* which is written with three letters but the last one isn't pronounced so it has just two sounds
Same with *Adë*, *Arrë*and *Urë*.
One that made me really laugh was in sponge bob
I don’t know the exact episode but in English there is a mailman that refers to Squidward as “Mr
Tentacles
” In Albanian, he calls him “Zoti Kallamar
”  Which translates to Mr
Squid
But if you know English as well, it basically means Mr
Calamari
Most people in Albania know decent-to-very well Italian, due to the broadcast of various Italian TV networks
In addition to that, English is pretty much spoken by everyone under the age of 40 or so
Depending on elective courses they've taken during high school, German and French aren't that uncommon either
Its not that bad
Usually People who leave the country are the most desperate ones
They can't find a job here so they go abroad and do hard jobs (legally/illegally) for a few euros
I think having fewer people is nice, quieter
I prefer Pellini to Illy tbqh
But other than that you are right
Yeah, no dude
I literally don't know anyone who doesn't drink alcohol at all
“Më rafte pika
([mua] for extra emphasis)”.
It’s really weird when literally translated- “May the dot/point drop on me
”. It’s used to show that your sorry that something happened to someone else:
Eng: Did you hurt yourself
Yes
May the point drop on me
Alb: U vrave
Më rafte pika mua
We have the same in Albania but it's with a hair and a log
[Albania here
] Not really the "a-dialect-per-town" situation, but complicated-ish enough for a small country
Idk if you’ve heard of this but there’s this mystical place called “The Balkans” and that’s what everyone is about over there
You won’t find many historic events that are not contended and won’t start a fight
You clearly haven't been to the Balkans
Unfortunately , I've played only in Hearts of Iron IV, and I've tried a lot of countries, but mostly I like playing as Japan because
because I don't know xD really, maybe 'cause I just like the national focuses of Japan, and generally I had best gameplay as Japan, besides I like playing as German because mostly all things and decisions depend on it
It's a tie between Prague and Krakow
I'm just really interested in the culture and architecture of the two cities labeled as among the most beautiful in Europe
Serbia
Yea we definitely wouldn’t go far if we invaded you guys
At least not by ourselves
Cyprus wasn't in the EU when the invasion happened though
Yea for sure
You guys are kept updated with Russia’s best equipment
We still use old shit
But yea, if we where talking about alliances then I don’t know who would win honestly
Yeah, but it's a continuation of a de facto status quo, it's not a new invasion or something
Our pessimism is unparalleled .
The language and we have the most coffee shops per capita in Europe
Take that Spain
I wouldn't consider it a trait, but it's something I find uniquely weird xD
The currency reform back in 1965 changed the amounts to a 10:1 ratio
(100 lekë would now be 10 lekë etc)
Apparently the population at that time didn't adapt well, as we still to this day use old values to refer to the new ones, i.e. a 10 lekë coin in colloquial Albanian is both "100 old lekë" and "10 new lekë".
Here in Albania we have nearly these times for eating, maybe a little bit earlier for dinner (around 21:30), but overall we eat very very late
Konispol
The most southern town in Albania
Pretty sure almost everyone is greek there
I mean that's not even that bad compared to this: [
"Himni i flamurit" we actually have words
I'm that guy
I think I've actually never used the correct form of this question
It's so normal in my native language to use 'how' in that context that my brain can't process the right way to say it
Make
Me means "with" in Greek
It's the same word in Albanian
interesting
Just mine and my neighbor's cats and dogs
We are is small community since 5 generation and is kind of communism
Sportswise, without taking in account the human rights issues already remembered in other comments, I know I'll hate it because
...the leagues and Champions league will be suspended
...players might get injured while playing the world cup and miss the rest of the season
...summer 2022 will be boring
...I'll miss watching the games in the city square with other people while eating something and drinking cold drinks to contrast the summer's heat
But I already know I'll still find a way to enjoy the event because a World Cup is still a World Cup: the greatest event in sports (bar the Olympics)

Trains
The railway network in Albania is now decrepit and its days are [numbered] It never was that great to begin with, but I always loved viewing the landscape from the window as the train passed by pretty much uninhabited and otherwise-very-difficult-to access terrain
Furgons
Unless you have a car, this is your best bet when going between cities/villages
They’re like minibuses but they aren’t like a business or anything
It’s usually just a bunch of independent people who just own one and drive between cities picking up and dropping people off
Max occupancy 15, we somehow manage to fit like 30 people inside
I haven’t come across them outside of Albania, probably because other countries actually have developed systems for trains/subways/busses
So I get nostalgic when I see one
The trains were implemented as a necessity back then, because during the communist regime private transport (as in having your own car) was prohibited
After its abolition, the following governments invested a great deal in motorways and roads to connect the cities, leaving the railways to rust
Did they go about the best way for doing things
Obviously not
Yeah totally, although I wouldn't mind having efficient trains as well :P. I always marvel at subway and train stations whenever I go abroad
Do you live here
You seem so knowledgeable about our roads
You're welcome any time after corona
We call it "Çekia" in Albanian
"Czechia" in English sounds off and weird for some reason
2 main varieties, Gheg (northern) and Tosk (southern) dialects
Arvanitika (spoken in Greece) and Arbëresh (spoken in Italy) are usually considered Tosk dialects but have diverged enough over the past centuries to nearly become dialects themselves
Each variety then has dialects which differentiate a lot from one another both in phonology and in vocabulary
Maybe due to the rugged mountainous terrain or for other reasons the rate of differentiation is quite high, and city to city only a couple of tens of kilometers away can be classified as their own "talk".
Technically speaking though, there are 5 or 6 Gheg dialects, 1 intermediate dialect, 3 Tosk dialects, 5 Arbëresh dialects, 4 Arvanitic dialects
Faleminderit, Thank you, Grazie, Danke,Merci , Hvala, Paldies, Spasiba(probably wrote it wrong)

We had a choice and for some reason our puppet leader said no

The fact that some place in the region shared Albania’s name at one point is inconvenient
Did you guys even have enough reason to like Russia to begin with (considering historical reasons)
Sharing a similar culture/language is often not enough
Mostly football, basketball, or volleyball
When I had to be near home then I would play tag or hide and seek with the kids that lived in the area
I lived on a mountain in Shkodër and would just go up/down to check to see if friends where home/available
That was a while ago though
As I got older my parents saved up for video games and I mostly played them to pass time
Kurvelesh - Bitch-wool

Qinam - fucking fame/renown/reputation
Kakardhiq - shit (with a spin on it)
Karkanjos - dick risk
There's plenty in Kosovo and North Macedonia but I won't spoil them for you
Probably the Tragedy of Otranto  in which an Albanian vessel containing 142 passengers illegally entering Italian territorial waters capsized after dangerous manoeuvring incited by an Italian naval vessel
Around 83 people died and both the Italian and Albanian captains were held responsible for the event, and got sentenced to 3 and 4 years in prison respectively
It depends on where I am
Usually in America, not many people know anything about Albania
The most common question I get is “is that related to Armenia
” I usually just laugh but idk how some people be this way
When in Italy it’s really 50/50
I’ve gotten positive remarks about how Albania is beautiful or the food is great but I’ve also gotten really sour looks
“What’s Albania
Albania had just became independent from the ottomans
So most of the fighting done was militia used to defend the country
I don’t believe Albania as a nation participated in the conflict
Thank you
I few idiots won’t stop me from enjoying myself
I love Italy as well
From what I remember, we didn’t really have any support at the time
I know Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria wanted to push the Ottomans out which kind of lead to them “supporting” the creation of Albania
But I’m pretty sure Albania was trying to keep itself neutral
I wouldn’t say “large
” After all Albania is not very big
However, we did have resistance
The resistances where split between the nationalists (democratic) and the communist
Originally, the communists lacked support and where small in numbers but (obviously) later gained traction
We didn’t stand much of a chance against either Germany or Italy but we did have the home turf
Moral was also higher for the Albanians
To the Albanians it was to defend their home but for the Italian troops stationed there it felt like a waste of time
Most of the weapons the Albanians used where simply stolen from Italians or left over from the Germans
After this, communism was established and Albania went to shit
I’m happy to help
I believe we had about 1/3 the man power
Italy also had much more equipment and vehicles to support them
Yea
They where badasses
I can’t even imagine what it was like
Here in Tirana rarely . Maybe once every 2-3 years but lately its even more rare
Adding Albania too
We’re suffering the same
The worst is the sale if you join the club
They will pester with calls to get the latest thing they’re promoting
Icelandic and Japanese
I mean I do it too
I like to eavesdrop other peoples conversation *especially* if I don’t understand the language
I don’t think there will ever be any
We’re always the criminals
> Please
K, I changed my mind
....Here we go again
North Macedonia
You mean west Bulgaria
A.k.a Southern Denmark
Gentius, King of Illyria
Skanderbeg( today is his birthday btw, May 6th)
Hamza Kastrioti
Gjon Buzuku
Ali Pasha of Tepelena
The Frasheri brothers (Naim, Sami and Abdyl)
Ismail Qemali
Luigj Gurakuqi
Isa Boletini
Bajram Curri
Essad Pasha Toptani
Prince Wilhelm of Wied (Not Albanian but still he was Prince of Albania for a few months)
Avni Rustemi
Fan Noli
Ahmet Zogu
Mit'Hat Frasheri
Enver Hoxha
Adem Jashari
Inside the city proper, there is the [city castle] and well as [Et'Hem Bey Mosque] although I'm not sure if the latter quite fits
On the suburbs are located [these] [two] castles
Should note that they are more ruins than proper castles
Literally the same here
About 250-300 EU per month
I live in my childhood home still so I don't pay any rent to my parents who live in another city
If I had to pay rent I wouldn't have any savings at all probably
Only reason: Nobody knows our language so everyone would start at the same level of knowledge
As fair as it can be
No favoritism
You’re talking about 6 million of people, 8 at most counting the diaspora
There are more than 700 million people in Europe
Although maybe there are less Basque speakers
They might have a point in their language too
Welcome to Albania, where jaywalking isn't punishable, nor even called a crime
Do you go out often
In Albania we use hekurudha-1, hekurudha-2
Hekurudha means railway and is the long word which together with the number makes it a second duration
The trouble is that you have to continue counting from one onwards after 10 or the time will be longer than the second
Yes I can confirm this
My grandfather shakes his head when he listens to someone talk to indicate he is listening
If he asks someone if they want something you have to make sure you tell him verbally because chances are he will think the opposite of what you think
Some of family used to do this, but when we moved to the US, they all just adapted
We say "mbrapa diellit" which literally translates "Behind the sun".
In Albanian ( Shqip)
Koka, shpatullat, gjunjët dhe këmbët, gjunjët dhe gishtat e këmbëve
Dhe sytë dhe veshët dhe goja dhe hunda
Koka, shpatullat, gjunjët dhe këmbët, gjunjët dhe gishtat e  këmbëve
I doubt anybody would read such a long comment so let’s say 99% of them
I thought you guys loved him
We actually have proof that most of our ministers have plagiarized or falsified degrees and shit still doesn't hit the fan
I would say the group of people who declared the independence led by Ismail Qemali
And Maybe Azem Hajdari (the main name during the protests that brought the end of Communism)
So basically no politicians during normal peace time since all I mentioned were during some crisis
I mean people were literally willing to die for him during the coup
Propaganda must be very legit over there
People like that remind me only of North Korea and my country during communism
Idk why, but I wouldn’t consider him a politician tho
That’s the reason why I didn’t mention him
He’s more of a military genius and commander
I can see some people liking Zog since he had his goods and bads but who the hell likes Hoxha
Crazy mf
Could be but such coups are not something new and unheard in Turkey tho
Am I right ? So who knows
“Resisting the West” is one of the worse decisions that my country has made in all its long history
The only good thing about him was the creation of a good army
Well he lost Istanbul in the regional elections right
Hopefully that means he’s gonna lose the general ones as well
Any country because there are albanians all over europe
Our neighbours
Tirana, Albania here
The safest I feel than anywhere else I've been
I can walk in pitch dark alleys here and not batting an eye
I'd probably say something like [çifteli] or [lahuta]
Lezhe (Albania):
- 2nd March 1444: several albanian and regional feudal lords pledge an anti-ottoman military alliance led by Skanderbeg, our national hero
It's the League of Lezhe (Besëlidhja e Lezhës)
- 17th January 1468: Skanderbeg dies from malaria there at the age of 62
It happens here too
I can't count the number of times I had to argue with someone in the middle of the bar/restaurant over who was gonna pay while the waiter was standing there
The older they are the harder it is for you to win that battle
In Albania I would say taxi drivers trying to overcharge
Not my country but many small restaurants in Rome don’t have a real kitchen
You’re paying for the view and frozen garbage food
In albanian the 'bat' is called *lakuriqi i nates*, and it literally means 'the naked one of the night'
We have an area in the north named “Has
” This literally translates to “Face
Does [Bosanska Artiljerija - yt official video] count
Catchiest patriotic/war song ever
yeah I like it too
Walking over a kid/their legs means they’re never going to grow
everyone might know this but the unreasonable plane tickets of the only airport we got
it makes leaving for trips a pain in the ass
Vlora Airport (south) and Kukësi Airport (north) are ready
It's just that the company that manages Tirana Airport has a monopoly which was pretty much given to them by the government many years ago
That meant that for a number of years no other airports were able to operate in Albania
The nowdays government is trying to break the contract in my knowledge and they are expecting to have the 2 other airports up and running in 2020
> they are expecting to have the 2 other airports up and running in 2020
.....suuure
one can hope
1912 is the year of founding for us
However, there where plenty of Albanian tribes in the area for much easier but 1912 was the year we all unified
First Turks Country is Xiongnu Empire that was founded in 3rd Century BC but it is in the Middle Asia
Seljuks Rums was founded in 1075 in the Anatolia and Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 so it can be 97 years old or 945 or 2000
As a kid I lived on a mountain in Shkodër. We had a fair amount of neighbors but we didn’t really know most of them
However, most of the kids that where roughly my age giver or take 3 years would come to us and vice versa to hang out
Our parent would say “just go outside and play with x’s kids, see if they are home
” Plus at the time it was the only way to pass free time other than napping since I didn’t have video games or TV
I love the name Zoran
It’s definitely my number one favorite foreign name
Danger of any kind, largely because of stereotypes in the media
People often ask “is Albania safe to visit
It absolutely is, people are extremely friendly and welcoming, and if you need something they will inconvenience themselves just to make sure you get what you need and will ask for nothing in return
Whatever budget you have made for vacation in a country you’ve heard it’s cheap, you can be sure you’ll save a lot more because people, especially older ladies, will stuff you with delicious things wherever you go
And Albanian food is really good by the way
Many even let you sleep in their home so you won’t waste money in a hotel, the being a good host it’s one of the foundations of Albanian culture
Not only is Albania safe, you will feel safe
Apply the same level of caution you would for other European countries
5 people out of 8 million
So it is *very* common that you live on mountains
Alright then, it’s safe in general, but the drivers are crazy
What about Foie gras
We have roughly two bunkers ever square kilometer because our former dictator thought that a nation would want to attack us
Literally, there is nothing to gain from Albania except maybe chrome
If any of you here edits Wikipedia maps, change the status for Albania as “remove shoes at home
The map is wrong for us, we remove shoes at home
I've sunk hundreds of hours on Samurai Warriors series so I can name at least 20
Powder keg gang rise up
Oh boy where do I start
Leaked phone calls between high state officials including PM with criminals who pay people to vote for their party, drugs and huge cash amount in former Interior Minister's car, a road concession that had been falsified, even a fake signature from a US secretary of state
Ah, self burn, those are rare
I am punctual
Also I don't love burek as much as the whole population
I eat it, but mainly just to fill my stomach
Off to gulag tovarish :)
I'm pretty sure no one in Albania has middle names
But if we are asked for a middle name, we uaually use the father's name
It isn’t common legally
However, there are some people who go by the old tradition of having many middle names that where their fathers first names
One for each recorded generation
Idk how to write it out but it’s kind of like old fashioned Spaniards that had like 10 names
i participated in human trafficking
Good question
i wish i had a good answer
If you are together at a party, it is normal to share stuff here as well
What am i suposed to tell him, why did you drink 0
05 liters of my vodka
People would hate you for being so cheap
Some people are very poor but they have the right to party too
Gjergj Kastrioti Scanderbeg
Uniting Albanian princes under one banner against the Ottoman Empire
Designated to lead the crusade against the ottomans before the death of the pope
You have to thank Albanians for him
He was nicknamed “the devil,” Dracula
Well my great grandfather was the head of the house of trade in Korça during WW2, Korça being the most advanced city in Albania at the time
His brother was a partisan who fought in the frontlines but was caught by the germans, so he payed about 100 napoleons for his freedom (that amount could buy you a house at the time)
This event was later used by the communists to sentence him to life in prison for "collaborating with the germans", meanwhile his brother stayed silent
My father's family suffered a lot from this by being declined studying further in university and with quite a shitty economic situation
Perandoria Austro-Hungareze / Austro-Hungaria
Not sure about the last one m8
There was a fella back in the days who fits that description
Weird
All the movies on Czechs I’ve seen are more about the value of money in the eyes of young pretty girls
Nah man, was talking about that Mozart guy
But i feel there was someone else ,one who had some fucked up life ideas and funny facial hairs but i forgot his name
Nein, nein Kafka used to shave
No mann, it was a guy who everyone thinks he is a german
I didnt know who this dude was but i googled and his beard is cool as fuck
Have a friend in early twenties that doesn't know how to ride a bike
Not that rare in Albania for some reason
My dad did the exact same thing
I was even talking to him and realized he wasn’t responding after I made my first unassisted turn
Such a good feeling
I'm a cat fan
tbh I don't really like dogs bc they are too noisy but that doesn't mean I'd hurt any of them
Negative news : a lot of protests
Positive news : a lot of protests
We would be in a nearby table with Northern Macedonia waiting for France and Netherlands to let us sit at the main table
Bringing Raki to the dinner so we can break the ice with westerners but most of the other countries won’t know what that is
So in the end, we’ll take our Raki to the Balkan corner of the table where it can be appreciated
Prolly one of them, would have brought Burek too so we will have our own thing going till one of us starts the stabbing and ruin the dinner for everyone
That’s a good topic for a new post
Anyone knows why some countries eat so early and the others so “late”?.
That being said, dinner is after 21:00
We all go to your house for the after party tho
Everyone knows you guys don’t want to sit with us
Stop making us look like the unfriendly ones
Nah bro
You’re stuck in the same corner as all Balkan countries
So is Greece
> Now, listen here, everybody knows who makes the best burek and sweets in Balkans
That would start a war in the AskBalkans sub
Also I’ve never heard of Serbian sweets
I guess Turkey would win at that
> You could keep your raki for yourself and enjoy in our glorious rakija as long as you want
You mean that yellowish suspicious looking stuff you guys drink
Raki is meant to be as clear as water
Oh idk about that either tho
I bet there would be people from other Balkan countries that would swear their stuff is better
I thought that was just another name for your Rakija
What do you make it with
I’ve tried Croatian slivovica and that was from plum I believe
It was good but not as good as our grape one
>apricot , quince
What
Two of my favorite fruits
Now I have to try them
Any idea if they sell em internationally
Unfortunately I live in the states
I’ve tried raspberry and that was pretty good too
Banana Raki would be wild so I would pass on that haha
Thank you
Edi Rama, our current prime minister
I use Gesundheit sometimes with friends and sometimes I’ll say Ja
Neither in Albania nor in Italy
We nod our heads from left to right for "yes" and up down for "no"
I don't think that's true
Ummm not like they do it
Its more subtle here
We don't have a big one but we do have A LOT of small ones (inside and outside the country)
"Me te forta se ndragheta" hahaha good one
They don't even come close
We found oil and we are 3rd in oil production in the Balkans
Finnish, there’s a reason Tolkien based Quenya on it
We got the same problem, and it seems like Turkish influence might be the problem for us too
The amount of confusion those phrases cause is quite substantial
The "ë" is a schwa, like "a" in "a" book
It's like writting blod instead of blöd in German
You can still understand it but it's ungrammatical
I don’t know I can’t read
>Land of Albania
where Iskander rose,
Theme of the young, and beacon of the wise,
And he his namesake, whose oft-baffled foes
Shrunk from his deeds of chivalrous emprize;
Land of Albania
let me bend mine eyes
On thee, thou rugged Nurse of savage men
The cross descends, thy minarets arise,
And the pale crescent sparkles in the glen,
Through many a cypress grove within each city's ken
*Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage* (Lord Byron, 1809)
Saying anything about cars in a wierd accent with albanians will make them uncomfortable, as "kar" means dick in albanian, and dick is basically the fuck of albanian
Italian and Finnish are very melodic languages

There are a couple but one I personally like a lot is “Kuq e Zi” especially the one by Elvana Gjata + Flori
That song played at least 10 times a day for a couple weeks when we qualified for the Euros back in 2016
It jus gives me this sense of national pride and it also sounds nice to me
Less known to other Europeans or less known in the country itself
If it’s the former, then, for smaller countries, that’s almost all of their historical figures
I bet many people know Riina and not these people who were trying to take him down
It’s really a shame
Tbh I doubt regular Europeans (non history buffs) outside the Balkans know about him
He’s our main character but even him is not as well known abroad as you would think
Albania had a chance, and they fucked it
Kosovo still has a good chance actually and I’m rooting them on
If they do qualify, there will be a huge celebration
After that they will most likely get knocked out first thing lmao
Because it was the farthest point possible from a South Slavic, Greek, and Italian invasion
Albania still got invaded by Italy though and ironically, it’s the best thing that happened to Tirana
It wasn’t even a city before that, let alone capital city, so Italian architects built its foundation
We actually like most of the Italian designs, even the theater that the government destroyed recently, like cowards, was Italian design
We hate everything else, it’s kitsch at best
At best
In Albanian we have Mplasi kari which means “ my di*k exploded “ or mplasi bytha which means “ my ass exploded “
Më plasi bytha/kari/trapi (my ass/cock/dick exploded)
This means I don't care/I don't give a shit
Somewhat related - nuk më rruhet bytha/trapi/kari (my ass/dick/cock won't be shaved)
Means I couldn't care less
At least you can say ass aswell to sound more
socially acceptable
Telegram is a very good alternative
They say that it is much more secure and without ads
HaHaahh Americans stoopid
Now laff
Darwin awards in 3
We should all do this
Instead of buying a stupid metal straw we can just use paste and then eat the crunchy pasta
Well all just keep pasta with us
This truly amazes me
Don't forget shitting on Balkan countries whenever they're mentioned
They're not supposed to be working together
It's just that their beliefs happen to align
Hope firefighters can save it asap
Notre Dame is priceless for all mankind
Not falling for this
!remindMe 4 years "Elizabeth"
Albania is usually in the no data category
And these maps are outdated before 2008, since there is no Kosovo
I wouldn't trust a map that is 12 years old
I saw my region and was happy
Then I saw everybody else’s and now I feel less special :(
Gotta love that flawless Balkan infrastructure
and then they say the french always surrender ...
let the wars begin
Edi Rama's words exactly in his meeting in Kosovo in an unrelated matter
Exactly the first thing I thought
Geniuses, geniuses everywhere :D
I mean most europeans mostly care about american politics significantly more than there own so this isnt suprising
Congrats Montenegro, you did it
Didn't the Albanian parties grab 6 seats
How about you use a coherent map
Albanian and Greek "kagoures": are you challenging me ?
Glx and Emerson jacket intensifies
Ah yes, equality
Jokes aside though, can't imagine why she thought the police officer would stop and read what she was holding up in her hand

This sub has been increasingly becoming more far-right, so I'm not surprised tbh
Are we gonna ignore the fact this Greek was a communist
Turp
Ah yes, an obscure website in Greek, thanks for the source
Per ca eshte turp
S'je dakord qe subi ka shume perdorus te se djathtes ekstreme
Po, po pse me dal zot per ni grek qe ken komuniste
Kan djathtes edhe majtes ekstreme jo veq djathtes
Thank you
M'duket se e ke keqkuptu komentin tim
Nuk e permenda fare personin ne fjale dhe as nuk e mbrojta
Perdorusi nga Lituania u shoku me komentet qe mbronin nazistat dhe ia shpjegova qe subi ka shume perdorus te se djathtes ekstreme
Sa per ideologjine time, anoj me shume nga qendra, as djathtas as majtas
Gjithsesi, me mire eshte greku komunist sesa greku nazist qe del rrugeve dhe therret vdekje shqiptareve
Jo mer vlla, se gjithsesi me kan komunist o nazist kete me ken puna me na thirre per vdekja shqiptareve
Po problemi ashte qe njerzit jan progadit me politikan majtas

Terrible flags tbh
Non

I'm also learning French in school
I'm albanian and trust me, you're not exaggerating
We are so busy hating each other in the brig of globalisation so we let the corruption go
Cause hating over some shit that happened 100 years ago is still relevant smh
That's not the only problem that is holding as down mate
From Balkan, can confirm
Corruption is in the blood of the Balkans
No, you fucking aren't.
yes
And the good ol' "KOSOVO JE SERBIA" and "kosova je shqipëri" oh boy
So Albania is just a bunch of mountains
This is so fucking cool
Still not a reason to hit someone, people are so sensitive
The UK is a forest
The first comment on that video kills it hahaha

Imagine not even knowing where their bodies are
I'm Italian and totally not a fan of Mussolini or Fascism (duh) , but living here and talking to old people and fanatics I began to understand why some people believed in him and still do
Back in the ol' days Mussolini was the typical new face on the market and rapidly got to power with ideas of restoring Italy's former glory (2000 years ago I guess) and helping the people
He then did the usual stuff fascists brag about: reclaimed the swaps, helped the farmers, he even brought pensions in Italy (all very limited and very touted) , so everyone was happy
But Italy being mainly composed of old people in little towns (back then especially) (still best country) they just didn't care about the other stuff he did, like, I don't know, creating the modern totalitarian state, racial laws and sending a few thousand people to die
But then Benito also kind of lost the war and became a puppet to Adolf, and that was it: especially young people rebelled, and the rest, is history
Thanks for sitting through this little thesis of mine
Also a newfound grandson or something
His name
Ceasar
Literally I'm not joking
I'm Italian and, even though this Ceasar is new and probably worthless, his granddaughter is mostly a pain in the ass because every time someone talks bad about his grangran she freaks out
But she does not have much power
His full name is Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini
Prepare the horses and fuel up the tanks and afvs we ride at dawn
X doubt
Mastering their craft
Only the italians care about us
Ah shit, here we go again
Finally, a good comment section
Also just gotta put it out there that it's not all Islam
Albanians don't give a shit about religion mostly
Go Albania
I thought Finnland was WAAAAAY older, like 300 years
Want good coffee
Go to the balkans
Not the Starbucks shit America and western Europe serves
Powerful
I don't exactly agree with this, since the money you pay from a ticket goes to help the state
Fun with flags
Best one so far
And they haven't invaded only 2 of them I'm the last 100 ish years
Nice
i'd love to see an albanian version of this
Is that where the Joker met his dad
Commies fucks are just as bad
Can I ask how old is putin
Remember it’s war,it’s not a normal situation where you’ll be send in a court with lawyer ,prosecutors,facts and stuff like that
Italian people were suffering and their loved ones were being killed and she was making a fortune by siding with Mussolini and you still asking what crime did his mistress commit
I for sure know some cases where in a war people were killed just because those who were fighting believed that people from their community are spying them to the opposite force
Where I come from we have an expression”Tell me with  who you stay, I’ll tell you who you are”
Precisely
These people are protesting for true oppression
In America it’s about injustice
It’s ludicrous how obsessed the world is with America
They even started protests for a cause that has nothing to do with them
It really does look tasty, but also looks like it'd give mad diarrhea
Why do I only hear the "Macedonians are Greeks" only from people who have something against NM
I've never seen a single instance of people from North Macedonia saying something like that
Based, but this is r/europe, nobody wants to hear that truth
Mmm

I never bothered drawing mine
The two headed Eagle is awesome indeed
Seen these in croatia aswell, love the thought of animals using them
Sooooo

Trza=good
And it's practically 99% sure Duda wins
RIP Polska
& how are the frenchmen liking Macron
LoL wut
He was literally picked as the anti Trump of Europe
A figure of progressivism and liberalism
He's promoted pro refugee stances pro LGBTQ ,all that progressive package
Marine le Pen was regarded as the Trump of France
That is b4 he was president ofc
He's taken a different stance now
Be that as it may he promoted left wing ideologies
But he's done things to take away workers rights too
The consensus in this sub has been left=good right=bad
It's ridiculous
When it's really always abt who is the most moderate one regardless of what party they run for
In Albania its chinese as well
Albanian uses Chinese as part of the expression too
It's Chinese to me as well, since this map doesn't Albania
Should be same in KS
Someone else can confirm that
Albania : "its chinese to me"
This looks like the winterhold college on Skyrim lol
Time for VPN
Start saving the memes on our 512mb hard-drives
Good luck fellow neighbors, I wish nothing but stability, growth and communication for both our countries and I believe it will be achieved when we get rid of these corrupts politicians
Where need spoilers
Is the Covid gone in 2021
I feel like he just wanted to visit southern Albania,that X looks way too weird
At least you have roads

Albanian next please
Yep and I am ashamed for my nation
The paradise

These are relative percentages, not absolute values
To use simple values, Swede earns $129k vs American $100k. Swedish health insurance $16
7k vs
American $10k. Still a net gain (and higher quality of care/less bureaucracy/affordable for the population)
**Balkanites slowly sharpening their swords
Oh god
A UNIFIED IRELAND
20000 students have marched in Tirana, Albania for six days straight and no one knows about it
Tomorrow it's expected even a bigger crowd
Exactly, I was thinking that 17 years ago was like 1998 or 1999, even though I was born in 1996 and in my mid 20s...
Tbh, Every country in Europe is more relevant than Brasil
I'd love to see an albanian version of this
It's an island not Athens
Dont forget the cat
We’re doing that no data thing on purpose so they don’t have to put more colors in this map
Did you try to make fun on American with this ?
\*Live in Norway, the no
1 country for happiness and all that stuff
I'm sure most of Europe isn't this great
Maybe you could include Denmark, Finland and Sweden with Norway
Liz is on a record breaking form i see
We Albanians never leave ...
>My mom for example purchased a house at 16
Yeah because it's dozens of years ago
How is a 16 year old going to purchase a house today
And by purchase I don't mean signing a 30 year mortgage
We’re out of the Balkans boys
We did it
Seems like me still got the Italians across the sea
This is just perfect
kinda cold tho
RIP
I would like you at parties
my ancestors :)
We have an overly nationalist Greek here
well yeah lmao
Meth lab
Hope everyone around is ok
We definitely simping
Watch out Italy
With my country i am actually quite happy that it happened so relatively quickly after the fall of communism, taking the political and social turmoil into account
Still kinda sad that they haven't legalised gay marriage though
In an interview about the topic people were asked on the street and some grandpa put it very nicely
"Why do you ask me that
Why do you care
If they wanna fuck eachother just let them fuck
If they wanna marry just pet them marry
What bad does it do to you
you keep saying a children
it's "a child" not "a children"
And he respectfully declines because he's seen some shit coming from the very same hands offering him water
Oh let me kill this Šiptar

Fshati digjet, kurva krihet
he's not albanian
He is a gypsy its easy to tell
i just have one query
Pse shqiptar te duket ky
Ky asht magjyp 100%
For Albania that 110 whoch is already quite low(and not respected at all) is only for our one singular highway
Good luck Armenia
I was looking for this xD
Kick them out of the EU
Maybe it should
You are right, it's not fair, but something needs to be done
I’m from Tirana, Albania and yes these are true
These signs are put around bridges so people don’t go down the bridge to pee
How many more times will this get posted
It is meh
Not bad but not great either
What would help immensely is build some public toilets not these damn signs
It's ridiculous how you can't find any in Tirana
It is not bad, it just gets really dull most of the time
Are you sure about that
The last time we had an economic crisis,  a civil war erupted which left thousands dead
Most people are leaving or plan to leave Albania anyway
To be fair i expected them to ship chinese workers instead of polish
*Kurva
Albanian government has taken some strict measures and the infected rate  is very low
I think that many other states will have the same  problem as Italy .
But the Paris Climate deal says they can’t do that
Maybe we should consider giving them more money to handle the waste better
Call it by the name amico,it’s terrorism
"Ahh Ljubljana, I love Slovakia"
I hope you have points to repair the windows or buy the m1 grand of the wall
The Albanian flag is simply ridiculous lol
If you want to trigger us put a Greek,Serb or Turkish flag
Triggered
I wold have decorated it differently
Guys, it isn't funny
Prince Jacques looks like he’s gonna declare war on Andorra or San Marino when he grows up
It's just a 3
5 quake, anyone who may have experienced one will know it's not a big deal
You're so Fapping happy right now
Woah
next level of happiness
Same thing what Albania, North Macedonia and Serbia is doing
It's said about 600 blood feuds existed against King Zog
He survived more than 55 assassination attempts
Traitor
Tiny moustache but big balls
He survived over 50 assassination attempts and once even killed his would be assassin
As an Albanian I wish that this guy would have got more time to led his country, he is one of the best leaders we have ever had
Ah the traitor Zog
Only the glorious L E A D E R Enver Hoxha could have the idea to build those bunkers, since they take a really large penis to build
We can infere from this picture that Zog has a tiny mustache, very possibly because he had a MASSIVE shlong (as one probably would who survived over 55 assassination attempts
But with uncle Enver we can see that he has no mustache, which can only mean that he has Magnum Dong
bitch please, we all know that was my boy Enver Hoxha
Enver Hoxha be like:
Buuuut can you do diss
Are you talking about Wied
Because he was technically only *prince* since Albania in 1914 was a principality
Go and spread your bullshit propaganda elsewhere
RROFT XHAXHI ENVERI
RROFT PARTIA
amen brother
He turned his back to fascist Mussolini bent over, then lowered his pants down to the ground
He fled Albania when the Italians invaded and stole [$60 million dollars worth of gold] from the state's treasury [(which would be worth over $1
1 billion today)]
Mbyteni kurven lol
Firstly, you're not arguing in good faith
You're a person who constantly posts anti-Albanian content, calls Albanians "šiptar" (ethnic slur towards Yugoslavia Albanians) and frequents the biggest anti-Albanian circlejerk on reddit : r/for_slavs
Now that that's off, lets continue
You said Zog banned Greek names in Albania
Not only were Orthodox (Greek) names not banned in Albania during Zog's reign, but they were the most popular names in southern Albania
They were used by Albanian orthodoxs (and to a lesser % by Greeks) that comprise and have always comprised the majority of the population in Southern Albania
>parlamentary descision 2009 where toponyms had to be changed to sound albanian
Source
>Not to mention what happened in 1914 when greek churches were destroyed, greek schools closed and greek language basically outlawed and every sign in greek being torn down
Absolutely false
Provide some sources, or as I said take your propaganda elsewhere
In fact, the only one who bullied its minority in Epirus, was Greece, which resulted in the Albanian minority there being inexistent today, while the Greek minority in Albania has been thriving ever since
(Southern Albanians with economic issues gotta get them Greek passports)
>I know the truth hurts but you litterly can find verified documents on internet
Then provide us with some valid sources for the love of god
Go ahead and type "albania, albanians, šiptar, šiptars, kosovo" on the search bar of the sub and see what pops up
Bud I Live in Greece I know
People don't usually use AC at least in greece the trick is to embrace the suck and take everything you own (including the sink) and go to the beach
Yeah you just have to embrace the heat
It's just the way we construct houses in the med my father's house in albania has 1 meter thick stone wall
Greece is at 0
0355 pretty much we still don't run it
It's also a balance of knowing what to shut and what to open on what time of the day
Hahhahahahahahahah the Spaniards are indeed  very precise with their shutters
Do we know where they're from
I've been reading on Twitter that they were Chechen
At least 7 dead confirmed
>It does not help at all that it's "letonia" in spanish
It's called the same in Greek
You consider vucic a dictator
Great shot
Its Scheisse in switzerland, swiss people don't have ß
Somebody just google translated ours, it's terribly wrong
The Albanian translation is incorrect
While “Qij” means literally “Fuck” (as a verb), you’ll never hear an Albanian say “Qij” if they drop their phones
You’ll rather hear “T’qifsha ropt
” which is more suitable as a curse
Here we sell bottled water for less than 50 cents
Czechia ️
Karmawhoring this in r/europe
Really
Are we gonna start posting every european celebrity death here now
Of course, I understand that, I loved Robbie memes but what is it doing in r/europe ?
Data is wrong for Albania
51 homicides in 2018
Given a population of 2
875 million
That equates to a homicide rate of 1
The source is outdated
Montenegro has transformed to Albania
The albanian eagle is dope hahaha
Why is Albania always angry
Eurovision all over again
Geopolitics will play the main role
We’re screwed Balkan bois
Tbh you’ll get downvoted to oblivion most likely
It’s r/Europe, they’ll think we’re yet again fighting with each other like savages
This brilliantly demonstrates the diaparity between Eastern and Western Europe lol
I got two passports so i get double the states xD
Can't you paint it with something to add a protective layer
Fuck Mythos
All my homies drink Kaiser
Maybe back then there was something between the rocks to level it but with time it eroded and only the stones are left
I live in N.Macedonia and there is 34 kids in my class but this only happens to us albanians cuz we have smaller schools
Average class in Albania probably is between 34 and 37
I would add socializing as a factor as well
We down south are more outdoorsy than the others
Yup, We also eat something similar in Albania but we add meat
Well yes, California State University does sound very socialist
I like the flag of albania
Well done but balkan flags really took the boolshit
Look how he massacred my boy
But we all know, albania is the best Country
Can’t stand up to child sex trafficking because it’s “racist”.
And people wonder why the Labour Party got completely embarrassed two weeks ago
Wait this is hand drawn
I thought this was a black and white photo damn
Man keep up the art this is a masterpiece
Albanian gang unite
Albanians are the new Romanians on Movies and TV series , we are portraid as Mafia and criminals .
>Hey beaches, great food, laid-back people, sunshine
I mean all those things describe Albania as well, but it's not doing us any favors
A Romanian gypsy is still a Romanian
Alright mate sure
What about other Dans in Albanian if you trash talk other Albanians will join in
What’s going on in Poland ?Damn,that’s crazy
when your country isn't even on the list
Hasn't Albania had a highest temperature ever recorded of like 45°C? Why isn't it on the list
I'm guessing that nobody bothered to add it
My friends and I always make e little fun of Turkey for the simple fact that "kar" literally means "dick" in Albaninan
Wow im surprised that maltese and albanian are kinda similar
We most certainly do
Yup
We don't.
we are fucked man
Honestly, our top destinations are either within the country or in Turkey/Greece, so I think we can handle it to go there
Holocaust games are my favourite
You can obliterate one race and replace it with pizza,  which one would you choose
When our idiot leader Enver Hoxha decided to end all of our alliances and make us isolated
He then proceeded to make a shit ton of bunkers in case someone wanted to attack us for some unknown reason
Breaking a truce with the ottomans because the Pope is organizing a Crusade with Skanderbeg in charge of it
Then pope dies soon after  and nobody decides to help you
Honorable mention : “Communism” ? Yea we’ll give that a try
It really depends
My family looks at it as a horrible point in history
I have plenty of friends who also told me the same thing
But there are a few “traditional” families that think he was great
Some do it ironically, others have a whitewashed memory
My father was in the military at the time and he tells me all the shit he would say and it’s just as corrupt as you would expect a poor communist nation to be
I hope that answered your question
Edit: I do not speak for all Albanians
I blame the gipsies after reading this
Happy to help :)
More like a true European or at least a true Balkans person
We’re all kinda the same in that aspect unfortunately
I had a problem on finding what especially meant in my language today i freaking forgot the word xd
Fier in Albania
Is totally convert with smog and bad small from the canals that are open
Usually people who has to cross Fier drive like crazy because of this mix
Ah yeah and full of prostitution and robbers
"Had to walk all the way here
" No reliable transportation in Albania
We have about 2 bunkers per square km
Which sucks but some of them are now used as other things like shops or mini art galleries for graffiti
Albanians eat the most fruit per person in Europe
I think it’s something like 3~ apples a day per person if it’s based on weight alone
I do believe we are the largest exporter of chrome (as in the metal) in Europe but I’m not sure if that’s still true
The Albanian language has no roots to other languages
While we do borrow plenty of words from other languages, the origin is the same
We managed to qualify for the Euros for the first time in 2016
Still stoked about that lol
Thank you German stranger
I’m currently learning German in school
Hopefully to become fluent in the coming years
I love your language
I still can’t understand any Bavarian though
Clichè, Touchè, Niche, Vouch the first time I heard these words I was baffled
They don't even sound English to me
Disrespect the law and you disrespect me
Some stupid people are still upset about ww2 but I don’t encounter many people who are anti-German
If anything it’s the opposite
After all, it’s like every two people in this country strive to own a Mercedes
I’m actually minoring in German myself
I don't think this is even a thing
Like i have never heard anyone say "don't sit next to him he's german". That's stupid
Wait sauna isn't Italian
It sounds so very Italian
Some of these are really hard but the ones with -uo- are definitely Finnish, since I've barely ever encountered them in my whole years of knowing Italian
Would actually love to see who guesses the most right and what foreign languages they know (obviously Italians and Finns aren't allowed)
Most cities other than the capital drink tap water and wouldn't even think about buying
Tirana though has really bad quality of tap water and most people buy bottled
Especially when they the are above your head and look at you
Albanians are number one in Europe for fruit consumption per capita
I forgot the exact weight it was but it’s equivalent to like 3 apples a day per person
I think it comes down to how the other person feels about it
I have Serbian friends and we occasionally talk about the history
We have a running inside joke that we’ll try to kill each other
At the end of the day, it was our governments that did these things
You can’t blame single individuals for the history
It’s like blaming a German right now for being a Nazi simply for the history
The diet
Because the poorer countries are situated in Southern Europe and along the Mediterrean, people are exposed to different kinds of fresh food
Not only it is a rich diet, but also the quality is quite high
Meanwhile in Germany people tend to rely on meat products and less on fruits or vegatables
The morther you go, the more you will notice that the olive oil becomes less present
As you mentioned lonliness, it is not uncommon and it is part of the mentality as well, that the kids never leave the house even after becoming adults or getting married
This means that the elders are always surrounded by other people and in case of a stroke they have a better chance to survive because they get help faster
While living alone and experiencing a stroke has nearly zero survival rate
The weather
Being exposed to sunlight for at least 250 days of the year is really healthy
Not only weather is related to agriculture but also to the natural vitamin D in our skin
This way the kids will grow up with an ideal physical system
My mind went directly at this:
That’s normal for Mediterraneans
Nordics on the other hand eat dinner at 5
Për shumë vjet Krishtlindjet
My parents wouldn’t threaten based on wage
They usually compared based on effort
“Do you want to build homes or work in a farm under the sun
Well, get the education and you can work in a cool building where the the only parts you move are your hands and mouth
Multiple people have asked me if we have electricity and/or running water in Albania
Albanians are born with a cigarette in their mouth and are usually holding a bottle of Raki
In my country, ironically, the award goes to the capital city
[Tirana] by all means looks as if a 5 year old kid played Sim City in real life and placed the buildings everywhere like mushrooms by destroying the trees and the historical sights, and then built some roads
The whole country except maybe Tirana and Southern Riviera ( during the summer)
In 1997, Albania had a (kinda) civil war that was sparked by Ponzi schemes
Albania, at the time, had just changed from socialism to a democracy
By Jan
of 1997, the Albanian citizens at the time lost $1
2 billion ($400 per person)
This lead to protest after protest
In the 1996 election, the Socialist Party lost to the Dem
Party by a large margin and the Socialist Party rejected the results
Another election took place on October of that month, and the same result came
The Soc
Party rejected it again
This also played a role in the “war”.
To add, at the time, the Northerners (Ghegs) and the Southerners (Tosks) had tension
The North supported Berisha (Dem
Party) and the South supported the Socialist Party
There were more things that contributed, but the lost is too long to write
It got international attention, including peacekeeping operations (Italy sent 7,000 soldiers, France 850, Greece 803 soldiers, Turkey 500, Romania 400, Germany 100 and Austria 100 soldiers
It all ended in 2300-5000 wounded and 2000-3800 dead
After all of this, Berisha was voted out of power, and the Socialist Party elected Reixhep Meidani into power
Albanian has 36 letters or alphabet and we write how the word sound to us even names
For example: Friedrich Nietzsche ~ Fidrih Niçe
William Shakespeare ~ Uilliam Shekspir
Pizza ~ Pica
We are one of the only countries in the world that uses only renewable energy
Well , strangely 3 hours coffee breaks is something common in the balkans
Well , there is no country that has oil and choose not to sell it
But saying we are one of the least renewable countries in Europe is simply not true
Albania share of renewable energy in final energy consumption is around 40-50% while other countries like sweden 50-60% and Italy , France , Germany etc use around 10-20%.
Edit - the data i found aren't the most recent but they should give the general idea
I write it the first way
However, my handwriting is so bad that it kinda looks like a line and it’s almost indistinguishable from my n, m, and u.
Edit: Line not lime
Our politics will just give you a headache, im glad you guys dont have to see it on your news
That’s exactly the same here
I swear everyone smokes
And they start pretty young too
A lot of times, it’s a sign of disrespect if you turn down a cigarette
In almost any language except maybe Czech and English you are known like that
In Albanian it's "Çekia".
I think, I think you are not the only one
I would say the murder of many men of faith (doesn’t matter which religion) during communism
...Well not just men of faith
A lot of people were sent to labor camps or sentenced to death for bs reasons during those times
I would love to hear someone from San Marino about this
You’re not invited in the Balkans cook out anymore
Wait, what
Where does that come from
Hoxha most probably
Not really
Climate wise and nature wise, I love it
Sand beaches, rocky beaches, mountains, rivers, lakes, etc
Besides that it sucks
Too many wars
Geographically I’d say we have it pretty nice
We have both mountains and beaches
Plus if I want to leave the country for a vacation I’m very close to Italy, Greece, and Dalmatia (and other locations of course)
*"Mbledhje me drejtorin"* \-> *Attend a meeting with the director*. It kinda works for both taking a dump and taking a leak, as it is not specific for one or the other
Another funny thing I noticed is that in some languages they use *"laying the cable"* for defecating, but in Albanian we use that to mean you're about to have intercourse
It is common for the older generation but not for the youngsters
You were kinda cool in '80s and '90s to get wasted in raki but nowdays not anymore
People tend to drink to socialize (like lets go have a drink and a nice conversation) rather than to get drunk
In Albania i remember doing my homework under candle light
10-15 years ago
That was in Tirana
Now it's a rare occurrence but I guess it happens a lot more in the villages, especially during winter
Food rations haven't been a thing since late 80s-very early 90s, when communist regime fell
The others are true but it's getting better, i guess
Although we've been stagnating under the current government
Same here
There are some words that are borrowed from Turkish but apart from that knowing just Albanian doesn’t get you far
No but the old call them with other names
While I personally measure the Road from A city to B city by saying that to go there you need to listen 36 songs by 3 min
A small Byrek place should be available everywhere outside the Balkans
Kosovo for obvious reasons
Other than that idk
I can say we have many similarities with Greece and other Balkan countries as a super dysfunctional family
Well, obviously it would be Kosovo, but that is pretty given
Other then Kosovo, it’s really hard to say since we’ve been stabbed in the back by most of our neighbors lol
Most Albanians would say Croatia since we’ve had a similar history
Also Italy maybe
Lolllll I was going to say Greece but I felt like I was going to be attacked by nationalists
We are both native Balkaners and have lived next to each other for so long
You guys are definitely worthy of the Qifsha Ropt award
I'm Albanian and I think that older flag is definitely better, the coat of arms is incorporated into the flag in a nice way, instead of just kinda being plopped in there
It’s not common to ask for help for things like rent
But if you have a decent job and still live with your parents it’s common to just help out
I don't think someone should have children if you think children are somehow obliged to "return the big favor
" to you afterwards
Thank you bulgaria for hating serbia
Aghhahahahhahahaha
>hateful like albanians
GHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH MY SIDES
Have you ever wondered by we albanians might be hateful
GAHHAHAHAH you will laugh the moemnt you understand why
Nah m8 we only hate you and greeks for fun
You sont see us going around saying kill the serbs(beside some Kosovo people who lost their families cuz of you)
We are chill me macedonia, montenegro , croatia
Bulgarians dont give a fuck about us, same for bosnia and romania and slovenia
While you, are hated by everybody besidesbmontenegro
Albanian:
Xhon meid his uei tu a tavern thru dhë dark forest, onli tu faind aut dhat hi forgot dhë mani
Ai rili lajk dhis kaind of diskashjons, uai dont ui rilaunç dhis sab: /r/JuropijanSpeling
(I really like this kind of discussions, why don't we relaunch this sub: /r/JuropijanSpeling
Xhoni meid his uei tu ë tavern thru dhë dark forest , onli tu fajnd aut dhet he frogot dhë mani
In “Albanian”:
Gjon mejd hiz uej tu ë tavërn thru dhë dark forest, onlli tu fajnd aut dhet hi forgot dhë mëni
I read it over again with an Albanian accent :P
Hi* forgat*
There are small variations among the different albanian phonetic transcriptions here but I think you are the first one who used Gj instead of Xh for *__J__*ohn :)
Just noticed that while going through comments haha Xhon is probably more accurate in this context but I didn’t even consider it in the moment
"I'm a giant fucking slut for history", sorry just hadn't ever heard it put that way
Not rude but saying “are you sure
” after someone has already answered sounds very condescending in Albanian
If its a competition we are first
Its not an argument just a fact
In Albania, there is a fictional place called Democratic State lol
Shark in albanian is peshkaqen, which literally translates to "a fish or a dog
For me the Swedish Despacito is defineatly Basshunter's "DoTA"
I’m gonna reach a bit and even tho the research wasn’t done in Albania, Ferid Murad came up with the fundamentals of Viagra
He shared a Nobel prize for his discovery
> Murad's key research demonstrated that nitroglycerin and related drugs worked by releasing nitric oxide into the body, which relaxed smooth muscle by elevating intracellular cyclic GMP
Tesla spinning in his grave
Still better than having a grown ass man reading the subtitles in the background like they do it in Poland
If you think normal movies are bad with that voiceover, try an erotic movie
I’ve been lucky enough to run across one
It’s hilarious to say the least
[Polish Lektor]
I’d like to thank all the neighbors for sending money and aid after the earthquake :-)
It's definitely a thing in Albania as well
It’s not taboo at all, they are widely hated (except by few nostalgics who did well oppressing others and want to go back to those golden times), it’s more that there has been so much secrecy and fuck uppery from that system, we don’t know where to begin to shit on them
You can say whatever you want, there are people who openly support him and nobody cares
English, not like I have a choice
[Gërdec] Arms disposal plant
The depot full of communist era ammunitions were also mentioned in “War dogs”.
First of all, snails are delicious
Second, Croatia (Dalmatia) and Greece get all this traction about having beautiful beaches but I feel like we are left out for some reason even though Albania has beautiful beaches (and other natural beauties)
Yes sir, this man right here
Me 2
We absolutely do not mind
Copying someone's accent is actually frowned upon around here
If we have trouble understanding some words, both sides know how to speak the standardized language and will switch to it
I’m just gonna be straight up
Why do Serbians still deny the actions of their past government, and still support crooked politicians from the 90s?
Also, why can’t an Albanian post about their country without you guys commenting “Kosovo je Srbja”?
That's why American girls are easy,  but also you'll be dead in 5 months from an std
Screw Albanian women, much cleaner and sexier
I would say Italian because is more spread in all Albania but also south speak a lot of Greek due to easy access in Greece
English is something that enter lately and slower than Italian
Here in Albania second language is Italian and besides I would add Greek and probably Macedonian and Gypsy
popular in informal discussion but still some intimidating when is the moment to include the issue in other level
Most reasons why people immigrate to the EU is for better economic conditions (among others)
Of course it can be work related reasons, or some people just don't like their home countries
But I just don't see why British people would care too much about immigrating, considering the already high conditions they live in
From experience, the Brits are xenophobic people who dislike having to learn another language to adapt to the work conditions of x country
Hard question
Oldest I would say Hungary but we fucked it up during communism when relations went cold and they haven’t gotten to where they were since then
USA I believe is the one friendship that is strong in the minds of people now
Umm can we be friends ?
I mean we’ve never had beef . Have we ?
Lol kinda unexpected for us to beat the shit outta italy but anyway where do you live I’ve got some cousins and friends over in italy
It is really mixed with groups and areas
For example in Northern Albania, people generally have witty punchlines based on anecdotes or one liners and have theatrical notes because of the artistic scene
In Southern Albania people near the seashore have a large influence from the Italian culture, and use a heavy sarcasm about everything
It has become like a way of acceptable manner to say the opposite of the meaning you intend to
In other places it is basically a smartass humor which is quite cringy
Among the youngsters humor sense revolves around snob or dumb humor and lots of innuendos
Generally the adults have a sense of humor based on the communist influence or the "checkmate" phrases
The admirative mood of the past tense in imperfect, is used mainly for a comical and an exaggerated situation
Hyperbolism is a key element in our sense of humor as well
Also we don't like pranks, offensive jokes or dark sense of humor in general and call them "shaka pa kripë", which means jokes without salt, because they lack taste just like a dish without salt
I'm not even interested in my own country's politics anymore
I do see how Kosovo's doing from time to time though
We have around 50-60 political parties every election but only the same 4-5 win seats in the parlament with 80% of the seats going to 2 major parties
We have a single first name and the father’s surname
However, traditionally we would have every middle name of our forefathers
So a traditional name would be (First Name) (Father’s Name) (Grandfathers Name) (Keep going down the family tree) (My Surname)
But legally most people just have first and last names
Apparently the current Royal family is descended from his nephew since he didn't have any heirs
Do you support their independence
Thanks to the movie "Taken" no doubt, many people assume Albania is this mafia-infested country, when in fact, the term "Albanian mafia" generally refers to people of Albanian descent in that line of business who 'operate' outside of the country
Hence, one will be kindly surprised to find no mafia whatsoever in the country itself
Sometimes
Sometimes it's the mafia, or other nationalists
Or just a band of worried locals
Not public schools
Certain private schools do, and they're f(o)unded upon theat purpose
You can add for Britain that you had a guy fighting in WW2 with a long bow and a sword
[Mad] Jack Churchill
[Albanian riviera] by far, as it is a mix of both crystal-clear pebble beaches and historical sites such as castles, old cities etc
Lately the [northern region] has also grabbed the tourists' attention, mainly due to the national parks and hiking trails
I **may** be able to name all the 50 states (or 40 at worst), but I honestly know shit of fourth fifths of the states in the US
Im a native Albanian speaker and still can't figure out some of the grammar .
German but not because of the language but because i dont have that much time to study it’s never ending rules
Matlab for me
Don’t u dare telling me that’s not a language
It would be a pretty cool movie
All things considered its not too bad but i never use it seeing as i can speak English perfectly
Yes
At least in my city (Shkoder)
You can go into a bar and ask for a glass of water without buying anything
If you know the barman, you can fill the glass yourself
You must eat you look like a stick
If you sit around all day your ass will get fat and conjoin itself
Stop staring at your phone your eyeballs are coming out
Dress up you look like a bat
I use “Zemer” (literally “heart” but used for close affection, usually a spouse or loved one) for my closest of friends
For other friends I usually go with “Vlla” (Brother) or the Kosovar method and called them “Breh” (Bro)(Since I’m not from Kosovo, this is more like an inside joke to copy those from Kosovo)
More distant friends I can just say “Shok” (friend)
Bre means bro
Are you sure
You’re right my bad
I do use it like bro since it sounds similar
Gjergj Elez Alia, the mythical warrior who fought off the evil Bajloz, who stands for the Slavic invaders
Skanderbeg wasted the Turkucks Armies all by his own forces only the madlad
A fun fact about Sweden is that together with Norway and Finland we have systematically seeked to assimilate and wipe out the entire population of the Sami people
We have taken their land, denied even basic rights like schooling in their own language, denied them jobs, exiled them from their own lands and even forcefully sterilised them
Nobody even mentions them and this discrimination and erasure of identity largely continues unimpeded even today
Lol, that is so true
Albania here
I guess tourism is veeery cheap compared to popular destinations such as Italy, France and Greece, to name a few
With an European salary you can practically enjoy a luxurious holiday in the Albanian Riviera and Alps region with half or even less the expenses elsewhere in Europe
Yeah
I can get a full Suflaçe (Albanian Gyro) for a little more than a dollar at many open shops by the beach
muti in albanian means "shit"
The insane over use of “ë”
Also, I love that we have 2 main distinct dialects that are both beautiful
Finally, the fact that it is unique but still is an Indo-European language
Great game I might add
There are 3-letter settlements like Kuç (more than one named this way), Laç, Val, Zall, Luz, Qarr, Gjaz, Suk, Gri, Kam, Pac, Çam, Sul, Rov, Sheh, Kus, Hot, Tuç, Xeth, Reç, Luf, Ukth, Pog, Xhan, Ças, Kir, Vig, Mes, Kaç, etc
The shortest at the same time only 2-lettered settlement is called **Qa**.
Candidates for shortest ones are arguably *Ujë* which is written with three letters but the last one isn't pronounced so it has just two sounds
Same with *Adë*, *Arrë*and *Urë*.
One that made me really laugh was in sponge bob
I don’t know the exact episode but in English there is a mailman that refers to Squidward as “Mr
Tentacles
” In Albanian, he calls him “Zoti Kallamar
”  Which translates to Mr
Squid
But if you know English as well, it basically means Mr
Calamari
Most people in Albania know decent-to-very well Italian, due to the broadcast of various Italian TV networks
In addition to that, English is pretty much spoken by everyone under the age of 40 or so
Depending on elective courses they've taken during high school, German and French aren't that uncommon either
Its not that bad
Usually People who leave the country are the most desperate ones
They can't find a job here so they go abroad and do hard jobs (legally/illegally) for a few euros
I think having fewer people is nice, quieter
I prefer Pellini to Illy tbqh
But other than that you are right
Yeah, no dude
I literally don't know anyone who doesn't drink alcohol at all
“Më rafte pika
([mua] for extra emphasis)”.
It’s really weird when literally translated- “May the dot/point drop on me
”. It’s used to show that your sorry that something happened to someone else:
Eng: Did you hurt yourself
Yes
May the point drop on me
Alb: U vrave
Më rafte pika mua
We have the same in Albania but it's with a hair and a log
[Albania here
] Not really the "a-dialect-per-town" situation, but complicated-ish enough for a small country
Idk if you’ve heard of this but there’s this mystical place called “The Balkans” and that’s what everyone is about over there
You won’t find many historic events that are not contended and won’t start a fight
You clearly haven't been to the Balkans
Unfortunately , I've played only in Hearts of Iron IV, and I've tried a lot of countries, but mostly I like playing as Japan because
because I don't know xD really, maybe 'cause I just like the national focuses of Japan, and generally I had best gameplay as Japan, besides I like playing as German because mostly all things and decisions depend on it
It's a tie between Prague and Krakow
I'm just really interested in the culture and architecture of the two cities labeled as among the most beautiful in Europe
Serbia
Yea we definitely wouldn’t go far if we invaded you guys
At least not by ourselves
Cyprus wasn't in the EU when the invasion happened though
Yea for sure
You guys are kept updated with Russia’s best equipment
We still use old shit
But yea, if we where talking about alliances then I don’t know who would win honestly
Yeah, but it's a continuation of a de facto status quo, it's not a new invasion or something
Our pessimism is unparalleled .
The language and we have the most coffee shops per capita in Europe
Take that Spain
I wouldn't consider it a trait, but it's something I find uniquely weird xD
The currency reform back in 1965 changed the amounts to a 10:1 ratio
(100 lekë would now be 10 lekë etc)
Apparently the population at that time didn't adapt well, as we still to this day use old values to refer to the new ones, i.e. a 10 lekë coin in colloquial Albanian is both "100 old lekë" and "10 new lekë".
Here in Albania we have nearly these times for eating, maybe a little bit earlier for dinner (around 21:30), but overall we eat very very late
Konispol
The most southern town in Albania
Pretty sure almost everyone is greek there
I mean that's not even that bad compared to this: [
"Himni i flamurit" we actually have words
I'm that guy
I think I've actually never used the correct form of this question
It's so normal in my native language to use 'how' in that context that my brain can't process the right way to say it
Make
Me means "with" in Greek
It's the same word in Albanian
interesting
Just mine and my neighbor's cats and dogs
We are is small community since 5 generation and is kind of communism
Sportswise, without taking in account the human rights issues already remembered in other comments, I know I'll hate it because
...the leagues and Champions league will be suspended
...players might get injured while playing the world cup and miss the rest of the season
...summer 2022 will be boring
...I'll miss watching the games in the city square with other people while eating something and drinking cold drinks to contrast the summer's heat
But I already know I'll still find a way to enjoy the event because a World Cup is still a World Cup: the greatest event in sports (bar the Olympics)
Perandoria e shenjtë Romake (lit
Holy/Sacred Roman Empire)
Mother Teresa and Skenderboi
Not the Shevchenko I was expecting
Not really a thing in Albania
Most of the skeptics about vaccines do so because they fear the vaccines might be made in India and thus low-quality, not safe enough
Born and raised in Albania
I've been living in France for about a year now
I don't really plan going back to Albania, at least not any time soon
I’ll use it one day

Trains
The railway network in Albania is now decrepit and its days are [numbered] It never was that great to begin with, but I always loved viewing the landscape from the window as the train passed by pretty much uninhabited and otherwise-very-difficult-to access terrain
Furgons
Unless you have a car, this is your best bet when going between cities/villages
They’re like minibuses but they aren’t like a business or anything
It’s usually just a bunch of independent people who just own one and drive between cities picking up and dropping people off
Max occupancy 15, we somehow manage to fit like 30 people inside
I haven’t come across them outside of Albania, probably because other countries actually have developed systems for trains/subways/busses
So I get nostalgic when I see one
The trains were implemented as a necessity back then, because during the communist regime private transport (as in having your own car) was prohibited
After its abolition, the following governments invested a great deal in motorways and roads to connect the cities, leaving the railways to rust
Did they go about the best way for doing things
Obviously not
Yeah totally, although I wouldn't mind having efficient trains as well :P. I always marvel at subway and train stations whenever I go abroad
Do you live here
You seem so knowledgeable about our roads
You're welcome any time after corona
We call it "Çekia" in Albanian
"Czechia" in English sounds off and weird for some reason
2 main varieties, Gheg (northern) and Tosk (southern) dialects
Arvanitika (spoken in Greece) and Arbëresh (spoken in Italy) are usually considered Tosk dialects but have diverged enough over the past centuries to nearly become dialects themselves
Each variety then has dialects which differentiate a lot from one another both in phonology and in vocabulary
Maybe due to the rugged mountainous terrain or for other reasons the rate of differentiation is quite high, and city to city only a couple of tens of kilometers away can be classified as their own "talk".
Technically speaking though, there are 5 or 6 Gheg dialects, 1 intermediate dialect, 3 Tosk dialects, 5 Arbëresh dialects, 4 Arvanitic dialects
Faleminderit, Thank you, Grazie, Danke,Merci , Hvala, Paldies, Spasiba(probably wrote it wrong)
Only speak three of those tho
trynna learn one more
I know you are russian but you can't say australia is small

When we denied US aid post WW2
We had a choice and for some reason our puppet leader said no
Eagle-land or something
The fact that some place in the region shared Albania’s name at one point is inconvenient
Did you guys even have enough reason to like Russia to begin with (considering historical reasons)
Sharing a similar culture/language is often not enough
Mostly football, basketball, or volleyball
When I had to be near home then I would play tag or hide and seek with the kids that lived in the area
I lived on a mountain in Shkodër and would just go up/down to check to see if friends where home/available
That was a while ago though
As I got older my parents saved up for video games and I mostly played them to pass time
Kurvelesh - Bitch-wool
Vithkuq - Red ass
Peqin - Fucking
Sunqin - Not fucking
Bithuq - Ass-y? (can't translate it well enough but it's basically calling someone an ass with a spin on it)
Qinam - fucking fame/renown/reputation
Kakardhiq - shit (with a spin on it)
Karkanjos - dick risk
There's plenty in Kosovo and North Macedonia but I won't spoil them for you
Probably the Tragedy of Otranto  in which an Albanian vessel containing 142 passengers illegally entering Italian territorial waters capsized after dangerous manoeuvring incited by an Italian naval vessel
Around 83 people died and both the Italian and Albanian captains were held responsible for the event, and got sentenced to 3 and 4 years in prison respectively
It depends on where I am
Usually in America, not many people know anything about Albania
The most common question I get is “is that related to Armenia
” I usually just laugh but idk how some people be this way
When in Italy it’s really 50/50
I’ve gotten positive remarks about how Albania is beautiful or the food is great but I’ve also gotten really sour looks
“What’s Albania
Albania had just became independent from the ottomans
So most of the fighting done was militia used to defend the country
I don’t believe Albania as a nation participated in the conflict
Thank you
I few idiots won’t stop me from enjoying myself
I love Italy as well
From what I remember, we didn’t really have any support at the time
I know Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria wanted to push the Ottomans out which kind of lead to them “supporting” the creation of Albania
But I’m pretty sure Albania was trying to keep itself neutral
I wouldn’t say “large
” After all Albania is not very big
However, we did have resistance
The resistances where split between the nationalists (democratic) and the communist
Originally, the communists lacked support and where small in numbers but (obviously) later gained traction
We didn’t stand much of a chance against either Germany or Italy but we did have the home turf
Moral was also higher for the Albanians
To the Albanians it was to defend their home but for the Italian troops stationed there it felt like a waste of time
Most of the weapons the Albanians used where simply stolen from Italians or left over from the Germans
After this, communism was established and Albania went to shit
I’m happy to help
I believe we had about 1/3 the man power
Italy also had much more equipment and vehicles to support them
Yea
They where badasses
I can’t even imagine what it was like
Here in Tirana rarely . Maybe once every 2-3 years but lately its even more rare
Adding Albania too
We’re suffering the same
The worst is the sale if you join the club

Inside the city proper, there is the [city castle] and well as [Et'Hem Bey Mosque] although I'm not sure if the latter quite fits
On the suburbs are located [these] [two] castles
Should note that they are more ruins than proper castles

I live in my childhood home still so I don't pay any rent to my parents who live in another city
If I had to pay rent I wouldn't have any savings at all probably
Only reason: Nobody knows our language so everyone would start at the same level of knowledge
As fair as it can be
No favoritism
You’re talking about 6 million of people, 8 at most counting the diaspora
There are more than 700 million people in Europe
Although maybe there are less Basque speakers
They might have a point in their language too
Welcome to Albania, where jaywalking isn't punishable, nor even called a crime
Do you go out often
In Albania we use hekurudha-1, hekurudha-2
Hekurudha means railway and is the long word which together with the number makes it a second duration
The trouble is that you have to continue counting from one onwards after 10 or the time will be longer than the second
Yes I can confirm this
My grandfather shakes his head when he listens to someone talk to indicate he is listening
If he asks someone if they want something you have to make sure you tell him verbally because chances are he will think the opposite of what you think
Some of family used to do this, but when we moved to the US, they all just adapted
We say "mbrapa diellit" which literally translates "Behind the sun".
In Albanian ( Shqip)
Koka, shpatullat, gjunjët dhe këmbët, gjunjët dhe gishtat e këmbëve
Dhe sytë dhe veshët dhe goja dhe hunda
Koka, shpatullat, gjunjët dhe këmbët, gjunjët dhe gishtat e  këmbëve
I doubt anybody would read such a long comment so let’s say 99% of them
I thought you guys loved him
We actually have proof that most of our ministers have plagiarized or falsified degrees and shit still doesn't hit the fan
I would say the group of people who declared the independence led by Ismail Qemali
And Maybe Azem Hajdari (the main name during the protests that brought the end of Communism)
So basically no politicians during normal peace time since all I mentioned were during some crisis
I mean people were literally willing to die for him during the coup
Propaganda must be very legit over there
People like that remind me only of North Korea and my country during communism
Idk why, but I wouldn’t consider him a politician tho
That’s the reason why I didn’t mention him
He’s more of a military genius and commander
I can see some people liking Zog since he had his goods and bads but who the hell likes Hoxha
Crazy mf
Could be but such coups are not something new and unheard in Turkey tho
Am I right ? So who knows
“Resisting the West” is one of the worse decisions that my country has made in all its long history
The only good thing about him was the creation of a good army
Well he lost Istanbul in the regional elections right
Hopefully that means he’s gonna lose the general ones as well
Any country because there are albanians all over europe
Our neighbours
Tirana, Albania here
The safest I feel than anywhere else I've been
I can walk in pitch dark alleys here and not batting an eye
I'd probably say something like [çifteli] or [lahuta]
Lezhe (Albania):
- 2nd March 1444: several albanian and regional feudal lords pledge an anti-ottoman military alliance led by Skanderbeg, our national hero
It's the League of Lezhe (Besëlidhja e Lezhës)
- 17th January 1468: Skanderbeg dies from malaria there at the age of 62
It happens here too
I can't count the number of times I had to argue with someone in the middle of the bar/restaurant over who was gonna pay while the waiter was standing there
The older they are the harder it is for you to win that battle
In Albania I would say taxi drivers trying to overcharge
Not my country but many small restaurants in Rome don’t have a real kitchen
You’re paying for the view and frozen garbage food
In albanian the 'bat' is called *lakuriqi i nates*, and it literally means 'the naked one of the night'
We have an area in the north named “Has
” This literally translates to “Face
Does [Bosanska Artiljerija - yt official video] count
Catchiest patriotic/war song ever
yeah I like it too
Walking over a kid/their legs means they’re never going to grow
everyone might know this but the unreasonable plane tickets of the only airport we got
it makes leaving for trips a pain in the ass
Vlora Airport (south) and Kukësi Airport (north) are ready
It's just that the company that manages Tirana Airport has a monopoly which was pretty much given to them by the government many years ago
That meant that for a number of years no other airports were able to operate in Albania
The nowdays government is trying to break the contract in my knowledge and they are expecting to have the 2 other airports up and running in 2020
> they are expecting to have the 2 other airports up and running in 2020
.....suuure
one can hope
1912 is the year of founding for us
However, there where plenty of Albanian tribes in the area for much easier but 1912 was the year we all unified
First Turks Country is Xiongnu Empire that was founded in 3rd Century BC but it is in the Middle Asia
Seljuks Rums was founded in 1075 in the Anatolia and Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 so it can be 97 years old or 945 or 2000
As a kid I lived on a mountain in Shkodër. We had a fair amount of neighbors but we didn’t really know most of them
However, most of the kids that where roughly my age giver or take 3 years would come to us and vice versa to hang out
Our parent would say “just go outside and play with x’s kids, see if they are home
” Plus at the time it was the only way to pass free time other than napping since I didn’t have video games or TV
I love the name Zoran
It’s definitely my number one favorite foreign name
Danger of any kind, largely because of stereotypes in the media
People often ask “is Albania safe to visit
It absolutely is, people are extremely friendly and welcoming, and if you need something they will inconvenience themselves just to make sure you get what you need and will ask for nothing in return
Whatever budget you have made for vacation in a country you’ve heard it’s cheap, you can be sure you’ll save a lot more because people, especially older ladies, will stuff you with delicious things wherever you go
And Albanian food is really good by the way
Many even let you sleep in their home so you won’t waste money in a hotel, the being a good host it’s one of the foundations of Albanian culture
Not only is Albania safe, you will feel safe
Apply the same level of caution you would for other European countries
5 people out of 8 million
So it is *very* common that you live on mountains
Alright then, it’s safe in general, but the drivers are crazy
What about Foie gras
We have roughly two bunkers ever square kilometer because our former dictator thought that a nation would want to attack us
Literally, there is nothing to gain from Albania except maybe chrome
If any of you here edits Wikipedia maps, change the status for Albania as “remove shoes at home
The map is wrong for us, we remove shoes at home
I've sunk hundreds of hours on Samurai Warriors series so I can name at least 20

Leaked phone calls between high state officials including PM with criminals who pay people to vote for their party, drugs and huge cash amount in former Interior Minister's car, a road concession that had been falsified, even a fake signature from a US secretary of state
Ah, self burn, those are rare
I am punctual
Also I don't love burek as much as the whole population
I eat it, but mainly just to fill my stomach
Off to gulag tovarish :)
I'm pretty sure no one in Albania has middle names
But if we are asked for a middle name, we uaually use the father's name
It isn’t common legally
However, there are some people who go by the old tradition of having many middle names that where their fathers first names
One for each recorded generation
Idk how to write it out but it’s kind of like old fashioned Spaniards that had like 10 names
i participated in human trafficking
Good question
i wish i had a good answer
If you are together at a party, it is normal to share stuff here as well

Some people are very poor but they have the right to party too
Gjergj Kastrioti Scanderbeg
Uniting Albanian princes under one banner against the Ottoman Empire
Designated to lead the crusade against the ottomans before the death of the pope
You have to thank Albanians for him
He was nicknamed “the devil,” Dracula
Well my great grandfather was the head of the house of trade in Korça during WW2, Korça being the most advanced city in Albania at the time
His brother was a partisan who fought in the frontlines but was caught by the germans, so he payed about 100 napoleons for his freedom (that amount could buy you a house at the time)
This event was later used by the communists to sentence him to life in prison for "collaborating with the germans", meanwhile his brother stayed silent
My father's family suffered a lot from this by being declined studying further in university and with quite a shitty economic situation

Nein, nein Kafka used to shave
No mann, it was a guy who everyone thinks he is a german
I didnt know who this dude was but i googled and his beard is cool as fuck
Have a friend in early twenties that doesn't know how to ride a bike
Not that rare in Albania for some reason
My dad did the exact same thing
I was even talking to him and realized he wasn’t responding after I made my first unassisted turn
Such a good feeling
I'm a cat fan
tbh I don't really like dogs bc they are too noisy but that doesn't mean I'd hurt any of them
Negative news : a lot of protests
Positive news : a lot of protests
We would be in a nearby table with Northern Macedonia waiting for France and Netherlands to let us sit at the main table
Bringing Raki to the dinner so we can break the ice with westerners but most of the other countries won’t know what that is
So in the end, we’ll take our Raki to the Balkan corner of the table where it can be appreciated
Prolly one of them, would have brought Burek too so we will have our own thing going till one of us starts the stabbing and ruin the dinner for everyone
That’s a good topic for a new post
Anyone knows why some countries eat so early and the others so “late”?.
That being said, dinner is after 21:00
We all go to your house for the after party tho
Everyone knows you guys don’t want to sit with us
Stop making us look like the unfriendly ones
Nah bro
You’re stuck in the same corner as all Balkan countries
So is Greece
> Now, listen here, everybody knows who makes the best burek and sweets in Balkans
That would start a war in the AskBalkans sub
Also I’ve never heard of Serbian sweets
I guess Turkey would win at that
> You could keep your raki for yourself and enjoy in our glorious rakija as long as you want
You mean that yellowish suspicious looking stuff you guys drink
Raki is meant to be as clear as water
Oh idk about that either tho
I bet there would be people from other Balkan countries that would swear their stuff is better
I thought that was just another name for your Rakija
What do you make it with
I’ve tried Croatian slivovica and that was from plum I believe
It was good but not as good as our grape one
>apricot , quince
What
Two of my favorite fruits
Now I have to try them
Any idea if they sell em internationally
Unfortunately I live in the states
I’ve tried raspberry and that was pretty good too
Banana Raki would be wild so I would pass on that haha
Thank you
Edi Rama, our current prime minister
I use Gesundheit sometimes with friends and sometimes I’ll say Ja
Neither in Albania nor in Italy
We nod our heads from left to right for "yes" and up down for "no"
I don't think that's true
Ummm not like they do it
Its more subtle here
We don't have a big one but we do have A LOT of small ones (inside and outside the country)
"Me te forta se ndragheta" hahaha good one
They don't even come close
We found oil and we are 3rd in oil production in the Balkans
Finnish, there’s a reason Tolkien based Quenya on it
We got the same problem, and it seems like Turkish influence might be the problem for us too
The amount of confusion those phrases cause is quite substantial
The "ë" is a schwa, like "a" in "a" book
It's like writting blod instead of blöd in German
You can still understand it but it's ungrammatical
I don’t know I can’t read

where Iskander rose,
Theme of the young, and beacon of the wise,
And he his namesake, whose oft-baffled foes
Shrunk from his deeds of chivalrous emprize;

let me bend mine eyes
On thee, thou rugged Nurse of savage men
The cross descends, thy minarets arise,
And the pale crescent sparkles in the glen,
Through many a cypress grove within each city's ken

Saying anything about cars in a wierd accent with albanians will make them uncomfortable, as "kar" means dick in albanian, and dick is basically the fuck of albanian

There are a couple but one I personally like a lot is “Kuq e Zi” especially the one by Elvana Gjata + Flori
That song played at least 10 times a day for a couple weeks when we qualified for the Euros back in 2016
It jus gives me this sense of national pride and it also sounds nice to me
Less known to other Europeans or less known in the country itself
If it’s the former, then, for smaller countries, that’s almost all of their historical figures
I bet many people know Riina and not these people who were trying to take him down
It’s really a shame
Tbh I doubt regular Europeans (non history buffs) outside the Balkans know about him
He’s our main character but even him is not as well known abroad as you would think
Albania had a chance, and they fucked it
Kosovo still has a good chance actually and I’m rooting them on
If they do qualify, there will be a huge celebration
After that they will most likely get knocked out first thing lmao
Because it was the farthest point possible from a South Slavic, Greek, and Italian invasion
Albania still got invaded by Italy though and ironically, it’s the best thing that happened to Tirana
It wasn’t even a city before that, let alone capital city, so Italian architects built its foundation
We actually like most of the Italian designs, even the theater that the government destroyed recently, like cowards, was Italian design
We hate everything else, it’s kitsch at best
At best
In Albanian we have Mplasi kari which means “ my di*k exploded “ or mplasi bytha which means “ my ass exploded “
Më plasi bytha/kari/trapi (my ass/cock/dick exploded)
This means I don't care/I don't give a shit
Somewhat related - nuk më rruhet bytha/trapi/kari (my ass/dick/cock won't be shaved)
Means I couldn't care less
At least you can say ass aswell to sound more
socially acceptable
Telegram is a very good alternative
They say that it is much more secure and without ads
HaHaahh Americans stoopid

This truly amazes me
Don't forget shitting on Balkan countries whenever they're mentioned
They're not supposed to be working together
It's just that their beliefs happen to align
Hope firefighters can save it asap

Albania is usually in the no data category
And these maps are outdated before 2008, since there is no Kosovo
I wouldn't trust a map that is 12 years old
I saw my region and was happy
Then I saw everybody else’s and now I feel less special :(
Gotta love that flawless Balkan infrastructure
and then they say the french always surrender ...
let the wars begin
Edi Rama's words exactly in his meeting in Kosovo in an unrelated matter
Exactly the first thing I thought
Geniuses, geniuses everywhere :D
I mean most europeans mostly care about american politics significantly more than there own so this isnt suprising
Congrats Montenegro, you did it
Didn't the Albanian parties grab 6 seats
How about you use a coherent map

That's not the only problem that is holding as down mate
From Balkan, can confirm
Corruption is in the blood of the Balkans
No, you fucking aren't.
yes
And the good ol' "KOSOVO JE SERBIA" and "kosova je shqipëri" oh boy

Imagine not even knowing where their bodies are
I'm Italian and totally not a fan of Mussolini or Fascism (duh) , but living here and talking to old people and fanatics I began to understand why some people believed in him and still do
Back in the ol' days Mussolini was the typical new face on the market and rapidly got to power with ideas of restoring Italy's former glory (2000 years ago I guess) and helping the people
He then did the usual stuff fascists brag about: reclaimed the swaps, helped the farmers, he even brought pensions in Italy (all very limited and very touted) , so everyone was happy
But Italy being mainly composed of old people in little towns (back then especially) (still best country) they just didn't care about the other stuff he did, like, I don't know, creating the modern totalitarian state, racial laws and sending a few thousand people to die
But then Benito also kind of lost the war and became a puppet to Adolf, and that was it: especially young people rebelled, and the rest, is history
Thanks for sitting through this little thesis of mine
Also a newfound grandson or something
His name
Ceasar
Literally I'm not joking
I'm Italian and, even though this Ceasar is new and probably worthless, his granddaughter is mostly a pain in the ass because every time someone talks bad about his grangran she freaks out
But she does not have much power
His full name is Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini
Prepare the horses and fuel up the tanks and afvs we ride at dawn
X doubt
Mastering their craft
Only the italians care about us
Ah shit, here we go again
Finally, a good comment section
Also just gotta put it out there that it's not all Islam
Albanians don't give a shit about religion mostly
Go Albania
I thought Finnland was WAAAAAY older, like 300 years
Want good coffee
Go to the balkans
Not the Starbucks shit America and western Europe serves
Powerful
I don't exactly agree with this, since the money you pay from a ticket goes to help the state
Fun with flags
Best one so far
And they haven't invaded only 2 of them I'm the last 100 ish years
Nice
i'd love to see an albanian version of this
Is that where the Joker met his dad
Commies fucks are just as bad
Can I ask how old is putin
Remember it’s war,it’s not a normal situation where you’ll be send in a court with lawyer ,prosecutors,facts and stuff like that
Italian people were suffering and their loved ones were being killed and she was making a fortune by siding with Mussolini and you still asking what crime did his mistress commit
I for sure know some cases where in a war people were killed just because those who were fighting believed that people from their community are spying them to the opposite force
Where I come from we have an expression”Tell me with  who you stay, I’ll tell you who you are”
Precisely
These people are protesting for true oppression
In America it’s about injustice
It’s ludicrous how obsessed the world is with America
They even started protests for a cause that has nothing to do with them
It really does look tasty, but also looks like it'd give mad diarrhea
Why do I only hear the "Macedonians are Greeks" only from people who have something against NM
I've never seen a single instance of people from North Macedonia saying something like that
Based, but this is r/europe, nobody wants to hear that truth
Mmm
my favorite spot in Catalonia
I never bothered drawing mine
The two headed Eagle is awesome indeed
Seen these in croatia aswell, love the thought of animals using them
Sooooo
Duda=bad
Trza=good
And it's practically 99% sure Duda wins
RIP Polska
& how are the frenchmen liking Macron
LoL wut
He was literally picked as the anti Trump of Europe
A figure of progressivism and liberalism
He's promoted pro refugee stances pro LGBTQ ,all that progressive package
Marine le Pen was regarded as the Trump of France
That is b4 he was president ofc
He's taken a different stance now
Be that as it may he promoted left wing ideologies
But he's done things to take away workers rights too
The consensus in this sub has been left=good right=bad
It's ridiculous
When it's really always abt who is the most moderate one regardless of what party they run for
In Albania its chinese as well
Albanian uses Chinese as part of the expression too
It's Chinese to me as well, since this map doesn't Albania
Should be same in KS
Someone else can confirm that
Albania : "its chinese to me"
This looks like the winterhold college on Skyrim lol
Time for VPN
Start saving the memes on our 512mb hard-drives
Good luck fellow neighbors, I wish nothing but stability, growth and communication for both our countries and I believe it will be achieved when we get rid of these corrupts politicians
Where need spoilers
Is the Covid gone in 2021
I feel like he just wanted to visit southern Albania,that X looks way too weird
At least you have roads
Balkans*
Albanian next please
Yep and I am ashamed for my nation
The paradise
Based af
These are relative percentages, not absolute values
To use simple values, Swede earns $129k vs American $100k. Swedish health insurance $16
7k vs
American $10k. Still a net gain (and higher quality of care/less bureaucracy/affordable for the population)
**Balkanites slowly sharpening their swords
Oh god
A UNIFIED IRELAND
20000 students have marched in Tirana, Albania for six days straight and no one knows about it
Tomorrow it's expected even a bigger crowd
Exactly, I was thinking that 17 years ago was like 1998 or 1999, even though I was born in 1996 and in my mid 20s...
Tbh, Every country in Europe is more relevant than Brasil
I'd love to see an albanian version of this
It's an island not Athens
Dont forget the cat
We’re doing that no data thing on purpose so they don’t have to put more colors in this map
Did you try to make fun on American with this ?
\*Live in Norway, the no
1 country for happiness and all that stuff
I'm sure most of Europe isn't this great
Maybe you could include Denmark, Finland and Sweden with Norway
Liz is on a record breaking form i see
We Albanians never leave ...
>My mom for example purchased a house at 16
Yeah because it's dozens of years ago
How is a 16 year old going to purchase a house today
And by purchase I don't mean signing a 30 year mortgage
We’re out of the Balkans boys
We did it
Seems like me still got the Italians across the sea
This is just perfect
kinda cold tho
RIP
I would like you at parties
my ancestors :)
We have an overly nationalist Greek here
well yeah lmao
Meth lab
Hope everyone around is ok
We definitely simping
Watch out Italy
With my country i am actually quite happy that it happened so relatively quickly after the fall of communism, taking the political and social turmoil into account
Still kinda sad that they haven't legalised gay marriage though
In an interview about the topic people were asked on the street and some grandpa put it very nicely
"Why do you ask me that
Why do you care
If they wanna fuck eachother just let them fuck
If they wanna marry just pet them marry
What bad does it do to you
you keep saying a children
it's "a child" not "a children"
And he respectfully declines because he's seen some shit coming from the very same hands offering him water
Oh let me kill this Šiptar
*the next day*
Want water
Fshati digjet, kurva krihet
he's not albanian
He is a gypsy its easy to tell
i just have one query
Pse shqiptar te duket ky
Ky asht magjyp 100%
For Albania that 110 whoch is already quite low(and not respected at all) is only for our one singular highway
Good luck Armenia
I was looking for this xD
Kick them out of the EU
Maybe it should
You are right, it's not fair, but something needs to be done
I’m from Tirana, Albania and yes these are true
These signs are put around bridges so people don’t go down the bridge to pee
How many more times will this get posted
It is meh
Not bad but not great either
What would help immensely is build some public toilets not these damn signs
It's ridiculous how you can't find any in Tirana
It is not bad, it just gets really dull most of the time
Are you sure about that
The last time we had an economic crisis,  a civil war erupted which left thousands dead
Most people are leaving or plan to leave Albania anyway
To be fair i expected them to ship chinese workers instead of polish
*Kurva
Albanian government has taken some strict measures and the infected rate  is very low
I think that many other states will have the same  problem as Italy .
But the Paris Climate deal says they can’t do that
Maybe we should consider giving them more money to handle the waste better
Call it by the name amico,it’s terrorism
"Ahh Ljubljana, I love Slovakia"
I hope you have points to repair the windows or buy the m1 grand of the wall
The Albanian flag is simply ridiculous lol
If you want to trigger us put a Greek,Serb or Turkish flag
Triggered
I wold have decorated it differently
Guys, it isn't funny
Prince Jacques looks like he’s gonna declare war on Andorra or San Marino when he grows up
It's just a 3
5 quake, anyone who may have experienced one will know it's not a big deal
You're so Fapping happy right now
Woah
next level of happiness
Same thing what Albania, North Macedonia and Serbia is doing
It's said about 600 blood feuds existed against King Zog
He survived more than 55 assassination attempts
Traitor
Tiny moustache but big balls
He survived over 50 assassination attempts and once even killed his would be assassin
As an Albanian I wish that this guy would have got more time to led his country, he is one of the best leaders we have ever had
Ah the traitor Zog
Only the glorious L E A D E R Enver Hoxha could have the idea to build those bunkers, since they take a really large penis to build
We can infere from this picture that Zog has a tiny mustache, very possibly because he had a MASSIVE shlong (as one probably would who survived over 55 assassination attempts
But with uncle Enver we can see that he has no mustache, which can only mean that he has Magnum Dong
bitch please, we all know that was my boy Enver Hoxha
Enver Hoxha be like:
Buuuut can you do diss
Are you talking about Wied
Because he was technically only *prince* since Albania in 1914 was a principality
Go and spread your bullshit propaganda elsewhere
RROFT XHAXHI ENVERI
RROFT PARTIA
amen brother
He turned his back to fascist Mussolini bent over, then lowered his pants down to the ground
He fled Albania when the Italians invaded and stole [$60 million dollars worth of gold] from the state's treasury [(which would be worth over $1
1 billion today)]
Mbyteni kurven lol
Firstly, you're not arguing in good faith
You're a person who constantly posts anti-Albanian content, calls Albanians "šiptar" (ethnic slur towards Yugoslavia Albanians) and frequents the biggest anti-Albanian circlejerk on reddit : r/for_slavs
Now that that's off, lets continue
You said Zog banned Greek names in Albania
Not only were Orthodox (Greek) names not banned in Albania during Zog's reign, but they were the most popular names in southern Albania
They were used by Albanian orthodoxs (and to a lesser % by Greeks) that comprise and have always comprised the majority of the population in Southern Albania
>parlamentary descision 2009 where toponyms had to be changed to sound albanian
Source
>Not to mention what happened in 1914 when greek churches were destroyed, greek schools closed and greek language basically outlawed and every sign in greek being torn down
Absolutely false
Provide some sources, or as I said take your propaganda elsewhere
In fact, the only one who bullied its minority in Epirus, was Greece, which resulted in the Albanian minority there being inexistent today, while the Greek minority in Albania has been thriving ever since
(Southern Albanians with economic issues gotta get them Greek passports)
>I know the truth hurts but you litterly can find verified documents on internet
Then provide us with some valid sources for the love of god
Go ahead and type "albania, albanians, šiptar, šiptars, kosovo" on the search bar of the sub and see what pops up
Bud I Live in Greece I know
People don't usually use AC at least in greece the trick is to embrace the suck and take everything you own (including the sink) and go to the beach
Yeah you just have to embrace the heat
It's just the way we construct houses in the med my father's house in albania has 1 meter thick stone wall
Greece is at 0
0355 pretty much we still don't run it
It's also a balance of knowing what to shut and what to open on what time of the day
Hahhahahahahahahah the Spaniards are indeed  very precise with their shutters
Do we know where they're from
I've been reading on Twitter that they were Chechen
At least 7 dead confirmed
>It does not help at all that it's "letonia" in spanish
It's called the same in Greek
You consider vucic a dictator
Great shot
Its Scheisse in switzerland, swiss people don't have ß
Somebody just google translated ours, it's terribly wrong
The Albanian translation is incorrect
While “Qij” means literally “Fuck” (as a verb), you’ll never hear an Albanian say “Qij” if they drop their phones
You’ll rather hear “T’qifsha ropt
” which is more suitable as a curse
Here we sell bottled water for less than 50 cents
Czechia ️
Karmawhoring this in r/europe
Really
Are we gonna start posting every european celebrity death here now
Of course, I understand that, I loved Robbie memes but what is it doing in r/europe ?
Data is wrong for Albania
51 homicides in 2018
Given a population of 2
875 million
That equates to a homicide rate of 1
The source is outdated
Montenegro has transformed to Albania
The albanian eagle is dope hahaha
Why is Albania always angry
Eurovision all over again
Geopolitics will play the main role
We’re screwed Balkan bois
Tbh you’ll get downvoted to oblivion most likely
It’s r/Europe, they’ll think we’re yet again fighting with each other like savages
This brilliantly demonstrates the diaparity between Eastern and Western Europe lol
I got two passports so i get double the states xD
Can't you paint it with something to add a protective layer
Fuck Mythos
All my homies drink Kaiser
Maybe back then there was something between the rocks to level it but with time it eroded and only the stones are left
I live in N.Macedonia and there is 34 kids in my class but this only happens to us albanians cuz we have smaller schools
Average class in Albania probably is between 34 and 37
I would add socializing as a factor as well
We down south are more outdoorsy than the others
Yup, We also eat something similar in Albania but we add meat
Well yes, California State University does sound very socialist
I like the flag of albania
Well done but balkan flags really took the boolshit
Look how he massacred my boy
But we all know, albania is the best Country
Can’t stand up to child sex trafficking because it’s “racist”.
And people wonder why the Labour Party got completely embarrassed two weeks ago
Wait this is hand drawn
I thought this was a black and white photo damn
Man keep up the art this is a masterpiece
Albanian gang unite
Albanians are the new Romanians on Movies and TV series , we are portraid as Mafia and criminals .
>Hey beaches, great food, laid-back people, sunshine
I mean all those things describe Albania as well, but it's not doing us any favors
A Romanian gypsy is still a Romanian
Alright mate sure
What about other Dans in Albanian if you trash talk other Albanians will join in
What’s going on in Poland ?Damn,that’s crazy
when your country isn't even on the list
Hasn't Albania had a highest temperature ever recorded of like 45°C? Why isn't it on the list
I'm guessing that nobody bothered to add it
My friends and I always make e little fun of Turkey for the simple fact that "kar" literally means "dick" in Albaninan
Wow im surprised that maltese and albanian are kinda similar
We most certainly do
Yup
We don't.
we are fucked man
Honestly, our top destinations are either within the country or in Turkey/Greece, so I think we can handle it to go there
