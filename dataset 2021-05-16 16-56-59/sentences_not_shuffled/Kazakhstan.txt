Dear Germans,
If you're so concerned with human rights violations around the world, why are you ok with Nord Stream 2
Not really, I mean 75 years have passed
On the contrary, I've heard a lot of positive things about Germans here cause we had a large Volga German diaspora that were deported during WWII who were hard-working and tidy, at least according to what older people told me
Isn't the company Voss owned by the Chinese now
Lol, you just opened a historical loophole in this comment section
Did you know that the dictator who has ruled Kazakhstan for almost 30 years just resigned
Not really a question but I wanted to share it
Spent all my life living under his regime
Pretty cool that things can still change in this country
HOLYFUCKHOLYFUCKHOLYFUCKHOLYFUCK
Currently the temporary president is the chairman of the Senate, but it’s pretty likely that Nazarbayev’s nephew will be the next president
Probably a transition to a similar regime, actually :(
Everything that’s drinkable haha
why you didnt mentioned Angela Merkel dictator
she rule europe since 2005
Thank you :)
Thanks
I’m just as surprised
Thanks
It's like my birthday but actually exciting
> nationalist dictator
He tried to find a balance between pushing more Kazakh language and still keeping Russian one
> I would assume that you know more about the country than me, so you've probably heard the stories about how ethnic Russians and the Russian language are being discriminated against there
Wot
More likely his nephew I think
Not sure if we can expect instant democracy, so probably not, but I hope we do get free elections one day
I can only hope
But the path to democratic Kazakhstan has never been so clear ever since Nazarbayev took the power in his own hands
We will grab it by the *khram*!
Borat used it for his penis
No idea where he took this word from
Maybe from Russian where it does mean a temple
No, you absolutely can
Did someone have said about Qarağandy/Karaganda
Then here you go
Uralo-Altaic theory in action
And Turkish "masa"
Aren't Brazilians mainly descendants of European and Middle Eastern immigrants, African slaves and native people rather than simply "colonists"?
We are in the top 10 of countries which has the largest police personnel relative to the population size
When I say my city is closer to Berlin than to Chinese border nobody trusts me
You're welcome)
Yeah probably
Hmm, jarak in Kazakh means weapon while in Turkish it means dick
Also kaldırmak in Turkish is to lift or to remove, while in Kazakh it means to leave something
Operasyon means operation in Turkish, while in Kazakh it is frequently used as a word for surgery
Bakmak in Turkish means to look, in Kazakh it means to graze(livestock), or to bring up(children)
I speak russian, even tho i'm Kazakh
And i understand pretty much everything on Belarussian, and yeah belarussian is easier to me than Kazakh (
I heard of it but i don't even now what it is
Also pasta la vista
Ah, i think i know it, but it seems to be that nobody know about it
It's just a joke no probs
We know about him, mate
No Arab countries
Maybe like Egypt, Syria
I mean there are a lot of unknown and hence uninteresting countries to me in the Balkans, like Albania, what even happens there, who lives there, I heard they are mostly Muslim but a lot of Albanians say that they're irreligious (communist regime's trace
), but Albanians from Kosovo are definitely Muslim
Albanian language doesn't give much information as well, they say it to be Indo-European but it doesn't look similar to any closest IE languages
Among non-Balkan countries, maybe Portugal, it looks a bit isolated from all mainland Europe
Moldovans are pretty much Soviet Romanians
It was separated from Romania in 1940 and 1944
They make a lot of wine
There are a lot of Soviet anecdotes/jokes about Moldovans, mostly about them being construction workers and their scientists stating completely obvious things
The poorest country in Europe
Had a conflict in Transnistria between unionists and Russian-speaking separatists
Has a sizable Turkish-speaking Christian Gagauz people
Gypsies
A lot of gypsies
Their population is dwindling like crazy
I guess you meant Slovenia
I live in a European part of Kazakhstan
Absolutely
Probably the type of news you hear every day
For example, there is always something happening in bigger countries that might get international attention like China, USA, Brazil, Russia, Germany, France, India, Britain, etc
Smaller states don't receive that much attention
Yes, population-wise
Aynalayin - usually used by elders when referring to a child, I read somewhere that it's origin is from the verb "aylanayin/aynalayin) meaning "let me circle around you". It mainly refers to very old and probably pagan tradition when the child was really sick so one of the elders will circle around him(in yurt, cuz yurt is round, don't remember how much maybe 7 times or so) do some other rituals and after some short period of time the child will be healthy and cured while the elder who performed it will die
I think it's very poetic and beautiful meaning that "I love you so much I can do everything for you and even die". This is how much we respect elders and children
Semipalatinsk polygon and [this thing]
Most foreigners don't know that Stalin is a Georgian, they just assume that all rulers of Russia/USSR were Russian
Not saying that Georgia deserves flack for this one cause he was harsh against Georgians too
Seems I have the worst result lol
Damn you Turin, never heard of you
Not so interested in soccer but I heard about Juventus, but didn't know it's from Turin( actually even the fact that it's from Italy)
Sucks that I know even some small cities in the Balkans but this dumb city stopped me
Bawırım - "my liver"???
Bratan/Bro/Bratishke - Russian/English/English loanword
In Russian:
* Я люблю тебя - I love you
* Я люблю себя - I love myself
Back when T9 was a thing when typing sms in dumb phones the first proposed word would be "себя", and you had to press several keys to change that to "тебя", so it was very easy to make a typo when texting on T9
Probably one of the "Russlanddeutsche" who was hanging that flag
Orban
Why
I thought British people spoke British
There are some differences in how Kazakhstan's history portrayed before and after the dissolution of the USSR, mostly regarding the modern history (18th century and onwards)
Half of Astana looks like a normal city
Would you like your anthem to be offensive
No collectivisation, because it killed half of the population of Kazakhstan
There's a city called "[Oral] (stress on a) in Kazakhstan in Kazakh
Its russified name is "Uralsk" though, which is also what it's usually called in English
1 tenge - nothing, I remember buying some small candles from local street babushka trader for 1 tenge but now you can't buy anything on this amount of money
10 tenge - nothing, ok ok if I remember right you can find a small match box with 50 or so matches with such a price
100 tenge - bread and 2 sour candies
Why didn't you guys embraced euro
I thought Hungary is quite rich for Eastern Europe
Same, dude
Kazakh has a similar situation to Russian, no dialects, minor regional differences in vocabulary, differences in colloquial verb conjugations and that's mainly it
A bit of a trouble can appear when speaking to a Kazakh from Mongolia or China, they almost don't use Russian words at all
For example while we have a bunch of loanwords for some technical, new stuff, they use old fashioned, maybe some made up words
Also some scholars argue that although Kazakh doesn't have a dialects, Karakalpak and Nogay which are considered to be separate languages but closely related to each other and to Kazakh can be considered Kazakh dialects, or dialects of one language, they don't have many speakers so that doesn't really matter lol
I heard Turkish in this case stands out
Like Western dialects, Central Anatolian, Karadeniz, Eastern Anatolian, are they all really that different
Like I hear a lot of stuff when talking with Turks and especially about Kazakh, they can say "oh we don't say it but in x place in Turkey they do", but I guess Istanbul dialect is kinda taking over in all other cities
Should've been vice versa XD
Moscow became the Third Rome -> Russian Empire transforms into the Soviet Union -> Kazakhstan became the last member of the USSR -> Astana is the fourth Rome -> Kazakhstan is the last heir of the Roman Empire
Malaka
Just now realized that Alexios and Alexei are connected
I'm an ethnic kazakh, who speaks russian as primary language
Mambets
Old people with fire
Turkish, Azerbaijani and Crimean Tatar: maybe like 15-20%
Turkmen and Uzbek: 50/50
Volga Tatar, Bashkir and Karachay: 60-70%
Kyrgyz, Nogai and Karakalpak: 90-100%
Same as Uzbek
We study Russian literature in Russian as a mandatory subject
There is ofc, lol
I just didn't think that mentioning this would be important as obviously you would study Russian in Russian
Russian has a few weird pairs like that, two that come to mind are world/peace and bow/onion
Do you mean Hindi
It's "balğa" with g being pronounced as French or German r. Not really badass I think
Man, now whole Ireland will hunt you for long
Simply no lol, everyone would rather don't talk at all than learn my language
Don't know man but the song is a banger
Any attempts to create ethnic or territorial autonomies always resulted in widespread protests and the idea being shut down
13 years holy cow, for me, a graduate in 11th grade that would mean another 2 years
Yeah we have a similar system but instead of 10, 9 years are compulsory and after 11 years everyone goes to university
Most older people who are from Warsaw Block and Baltics hate those periods, while most older people from other ex-USSR miss it greatly
So you are going to get a lot of different answers that are going to be contradictory to each other
I've talked to my parents, grandparents, relatives, teachers and simply older people I've who lived in those periods and while most of them don't want USSR back, they have occasional nostalgia over those periods as they spent their entire youth under it so they miss their old friends, school, Soviet-made products, etc
I speak russian which kinda makes me feel like a european, but i'm technically asian
I live in the European part of Kazakhstan and I'm certainly an Asian
Still, I feel close to Eastern Europe
I feel like I have more in common with Balkan and Eastern European countries than I do with Middle Eastern or East Asian ones
I can understand references to Bible or Ancient Greek mythology, but I haven't read a single word of Quran
Even reading Kazakh classical books is challenging because they have lots of references to Arabic/Persian philosophy
edit: typo
Pretty sure Austrian art schools provide everything students need, otherwise
(I know that joke was repeated 500 times but still had to make one)
Kazakhstan doesn't allow any kind of dual citizenship, although I've heard that there are some people who have it anyways (especially among the rich lmao)
I don't know how many people support it cause there is no survey about it
I personally want our country to allow dual citizenship
It would have been very cool tho
For example if I am going to move somewhere else I don't really want to renounce citizenship of my native country
Hungarian is possibly one of the scariest languages in the world
I could hardly call these things as "grievances" because too much time has passed but our interpretation of history differs from the Russian one
They often use "join, inclusion", while we use "conquest, colonization". [This article] pretty much explains it and it would also explain why the Russian government reacts so negatively to other Eastern European states when it comes to their interpretation of history
However, beyond Internet shitstorms, these things don't really come up between our relationship since we're on friendly terms with Russia and we can't possibly get hostile with them cause of the past
But it also means that we can't cross a certain line if we want to dig deeper or discuss further, so whatever is being said here has to stay here
For example, there are a lot of memorials dedicated to Holodomor in Ukraine, but for our "Holodomor", we have only [this cube]  I guess "Finlandization" would be a good word for it, eh
We do however, have current grievances with the other powerful neighbour, namely China, thanks to their "re-education camps". There are a lot of Kazakhs living in northern Xinjiang and some of them are stuck in those camps
We also have Uyghurs in here who have their relatives missing in the region
Our government tries to maintain a good relationship with China but our public is turning more and more hostile
Oi, thanks mate
Love your flag too :)
How many times did the constitution of your country have changed
What kind of procedure has to be taken in order to change (or edit) your constitution again
Wie die Deutsche "die Würde des Menschen" verstehen
Diese Begriff kann vage or unbestimmt sein
Can confirm, living in Italy now
6-8 years ago a lot of people also omitted ь in words like хочешь and молчишь which just made me MAD
Seriously, I look at хочеш and молчиш and want to start murdering everyone
What's interesting is that nowadays I rarely see this mistake
As someone who knows Russian language and is from a country where Russian federal channels are popular, I laughed my ass from your comment and could relate a bit
It was and still is common
Summer camps are for SVC teenagers exclusively ( in my country) ,for that reason they are free , you only have to pay for the ticket to get there
They usually last 1 month
Haha, as I said SVC teenagers
Finland's war with USSR was taught in our schools
Yes, we actually have quite a lot this month
1,2,3 and then 7,8,9,10
Russian is pretty much intelligible everywhere, but non-Russian Russian-speakers may add some words from their native languages
For example, Russophone Kazakhs use жаным as dear instead of дорогой, аким instead of майор, аташка instead of дед or дедушка, etc
There are also "mixed" versions of languages with Russian such as "shala-Kazakh" (Kazakh + Russian) and "surzhyk" (Ukrainian + Russian) that are very cringy to hear, both to native speakers of Russian and Kazakh/Ukrainian
Furthermore, some people from non-Russian ex-USSR countries and non-Russian ethnic minorities in Russia can have noticeable accents which might confuse ethnic Russians a bit
Northern regions may want to secede to Russia but it's very unlikely if no outer force will force them since it would practically not result in anything since economically very few differences on either side of the border, second is that Kazakhs gradually are becoming a majority there
And Mayotte
>You can't imagine my reaction when I found out that country doesn't exist anymore
It maybe doesn't exist in our maps but it exists in our hearts
"Hej Slaveni, jošte živi
Russia's population 144 million people, of which 110 million people live in the European part, so it's really surprising that there are so few of them here
As a L2 maybe, I think even authentic Irish phonetics is unrecoverably altered as most people learn it after/or alongside English
Don't you think it will be artificially sustained "corpse" even if all effort will be done by government in education
Czechia geographically is but
Belarus is a good, happy country
holy jesus, that looks amazing
Of course, how else would they be able to fry potatoes without one
[No, he just got stuck in textures
His name was Anatoly Golimbiyevsky, there's a [Wikipedia article about him] in Russian
The man that took this picture won the World Press Photo contest in 1989 with it
Wow, Kazakhstan is added
Thanks
Don't know about you, but our flag was definitely new
\-11C here
checking my flair
Should have put picture of nazi march)
wow you have shown 30 nazis in russia n1 now lets look at ukraine give hero awards to bandera, love OUN, elect nazis, love tyahnybok
n1 mr uke
Дякую степан))))
OUN is history
xdddddddddddd
this happens all the time in kyiv bro just admit it
not saying you are nazi and do not hate all ukrainians as my gf is from kharkiv but can not say no nazi problem in UA
Lmao nt Ukraine better luck next time bandera scum
does anyone remeber that time nazis came to power in UA and everyone in the west liked this and started supporting oun killings and odessa fire and wanting to put russians in camps
It's pretty interesting that despite many casualties, the protests did indeed succeed in increase of wages and more moderate government
It's a pain in the ass being an international student who wants an education in Europe
That's actually from my laptop xD
Excellent job, but not including Kazakhstan bumped me a little bit, it's mostly Asia, but 10% is something :(
Yes very bad russia lying about this but I do not know why you are think UA is in a better morale position when half of the people are banderites who are want to kill russian speakers and make lviv holy city of resting place of hero of ukraine stepan
this is why I want to love in Germany, but Duolingo made me lose my 70 day streak by 2 minutes
Oh, you are our neighbor
In Kazakhstan, I pay for 100 Mbps, also 8 euros
Russo turisto
Oblico morale
Thank mr bandera
Dear Germans,
If you're so concerned with human rights violations around the world, why are you ok with Nord Stream 2
Not really, I mean 75 years have passed
On the contrary, I've heard a lot of positive things about Germans here cause we had a large Volga German diaspora that were deported during WWII who were hard-working and tidy, at least according to what older people told me
Isn't the company Voss owned by the Chinese now
Lol, you just opened a historical loophole in this comment section

this happens all the time in kyiv bro just admit it
not saying you are nazi and do not hate all ukrainians as my gf is from kharkiv but can not say no nazi problem in UA
Lmao nt Ukraine better luck next time bandera scum
does anyone remeber that time nazis came to power in UA and everyone in the west liked this and started supporting oun killings and odessa fire and wanting to put russians in camps
It's pretty interesting that despite many casualties, the protests did indeed succeed in increase of wages and more moderate government
It's a pain in the ass being an international student who wants an education in Europe
That's actually from my laptop xD
Excellent job, but not including Kazakhstan bumped me a little bit, it's mostly Asia, but 10% is something :(
Yes very bad russia lying about this but I do not know why you are think UA is in a better morale position when half of the people are banderites who are want to kill russian speakers and make lviv holy city of resting place of hero of ukraine stepan
this is why I want to love in Germany, but Duolingo made me lose my 70 day streak by 2 minutes
Oh, you are our neighbor
In Kazakhstan, I pay for 100 Mbps, also 8 euros
Russo turisto
Oblico morale
Thank mr bandera
