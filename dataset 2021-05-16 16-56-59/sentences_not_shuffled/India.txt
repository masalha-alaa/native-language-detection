I came here for exactly this reaction
She is a Indo-Iranian goddess
Her Indian counterpart is Saraswati still relevant in India
What is snow
If it originated in Italy shouldn't they have named it Bambini
I thought this until I was 16 or 17 or so
I thought reindeers were just made up for Santa myths and all the big hooved antlery things in the arctic were moose or elk
Would that be a positive change, or more of the same, in your opinion
The first part doesn't really explain it all - what is the Indo-Gangetic plain, but fields mostly used for agriculture
France used to have 30m back when England had 8m and the Holy Roman Empire had 20m. How and why the French stopped proliferating between the revolution and the second world war is pretty interesting, and a return to partible inheritance is probably the most easily described component
The argument therein is that, post revolution, families had to offer each son a fraction of the father's land, and therefore tried to avoid having an abundance of sons to avoid dividing the land up into less and less efficient strips
ah yes, those famous wars in which France was the only participant
What about Russia, playing as a part of the Russian Mafias
I don't get the "AEIOU" ?
"Slutstation" is my favorite
It was Muslim-Christian not just Turk-Greek
Albanians, Bosniaks, Pomaks etc moved to Turkey en masse while Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians, Syriacs etc settled in the Balkans or the ME
Not if you draw the southern hemisphere at the top
Ok what
Up and down on a map are arbitrary
Umm, you do realise that North is not 'up' right
'East' and 'west' are terms again
If you have a clockwise N-E-S-W orientation and reverse N and S, E and W will also be reversed, if you want the same clockwise orientation
Again, arbitrary
Also, there is nothing 'natural' or 'easier to visualise' about this particular representation
It seems so only because you are used to looking at it that way
I mean, yes
I didn't mean East or West would be at the top
I agree that North or South would
I wasn't implying that South had an equal probability to be at the top
I was only suggesting that the statement about the map being 'easier to look at' is mistaken
Kids playing without mobile phones and other unnecessary tech connectivity
Same for adults
Idk if Indians can answer this but
Here u go—
Pakistan
Bangladesh
Sri Lanka
China
(Honourable mentions: Portugal and Russia)
I would probably replace Sri Lanka with Iran given the massive influence Persian culture had on North India's languages, food, music, architecture, philosophy, etc
Persian was basically the lingua francia of India until the 17th-18th century when it was gradually replaced by Hindi-Urdu
Portuguese were the first of the colonies, introduced the printing press and missionaries etc coming via Goa (Vasco da Gama)
French is AFTER that (in Pondicherry)
And I have seen the Dutch only a comparitivel fewer times in my history book
Spain was never there pragmatically
Russia helped a LOT in industrialization of India after independence
The top institutions like IITs were set up by them, then there's steel plants etc
and we have some russian influence on our Constitution as well, if not much
So yeah hence Russia
(in modern history ofc)
I thought I'd mention Persia but it wasn't restricted to one particular defined region as of then, which is why i didn't. Otherwise yeah of course Persian influence with so many Sultanates especially in the north India
Yeah, I don't think the Persianised cultures had much of an impact on South Indian culture
Just anecdotally speaking, I've been listening to Carnatic music and the songs are mainly written in Dravidian languages with some Sanskrit influence
Meanwhile Hindustani music is written in Prakrit derived languages with heavy Perso-Arabic influence
Oof, (I laughed at that)
I mean yeah we recognize the Dutch colonies as well, but the Dutch influence was comparatively VERY less
Yeah but I mean a significant of it did too when all of India was under Mughals
But yeah, I totally understand what Ur trying to say
But it's just that Persia in a holistic approach was a region
Only saying Iran now won't actually encapsulate the area which was earlier Persia
No, I didn't really mean Persian in a territorial sense
I was talking more in terms of the language, philosophy and culture that we inherited from our interactions with Persianised Turko-Mongols
Although Iran did lose its far flung provinces it was at the heart of a cultural ethos for many centuries until it was displaced by various European powers
Yes
Words right outta my mouth
Do you both visit Sauna naked
Medvedev,right
He seems very much like a wolf in sheep's clothing kinda guy
Really
He seems more like a Putin loyalist,he probably agreed to this new government overhaul
Isn't the correct way of putting it, that Hitler was a Volksdeutsch who thought it was awful that there wasn't a country for all Volksdeutsch, and so he took power in (Klein)Deutsches Reich to create the Grossdeutsches Reich at all costs
I get why modern Germans and Austrians shun the Volksdeutch concept, but ping ponging Hitler between two nationalities seems like a waste of time
We have canesugar juice with added lemon drops and salt

I was in college before I realized "locchering" or ['lotʃ:eɾiŋ], as we say it, was not a Bengali word, but the English term "load shedding"

Also Karma
Even Hindi borrowed it from Persian
I thought it would be Indonesian
Not from EU but shifted from Indian to Germany for studying
Eventual days were hell because the social , societal norms are the opposite in my country although asian communities are tight-knit
But have slowly got used to the working here and it seem quite good
And an EU visa is a really great way to explore so many countries and different cultures and ofc as someone interested in music gives chances to see amazing bands live
Plan to stay for a few years here and eventually shift back home becuase i miss my family and friends and indian food
For Icelanders, is it the case that almost everyone's grandparents were subsistence fishermen/farmers

Without a doubt, it would be Bruges - Amsterdam - Rome - Dubrovnik - Budapest
PS: Based on my personal experience after backpacking across 20 European countries
PPS: Visiting just 5 cities does not do justice to another 50 beautiful cities in Europe such as: Barcelona, Nice, Marseilles, Brussels, Munich, Krakow, Zagreb, Berlin, Ljubljana, Salzburg, Vienna, Rotterdam, Oslo, Copenhagen
THE LIST GOES ON
Both Bruges and a nearby place called Ghent are absolute beauties
The thing is most of the tourists in Belgium tend to visit Brussels and this leaves Bruges and Ghent a little less explored, although these have also become a major tourist hotspot now
Still worth visiting
Does your country issue an ID card
What does a generic one look like ?
What are its constituents besides name and birth
For example in Indonesia religion is mentioned in the ID card
Wow that photo resolution is so high

Do you have lockers for students in your schools ?
In India we bring in school bags containing books for that day
No concept of lockers
So how do you carry books ?
>To my knowledge, later students got their books split in smaller tomes, so they could carry only 1/3 of the pages to school
That's actually a very cool idea
But I don't how much it would affect the publishing costs
How many did you bring on average ?
Wait . What ? A tea kettle ?
Now I want to know who is the guy on the wall
How many books you had to carry on average ?
How much did you carry ?
Hom many books do you usually carry in your backpack ?
How do you carry books ?
If we used it in our school they'll penalize us for using school electricity lol
Thats true for us too
Also as you get older you get more carefree while as a child you are meticulous in packing everything else not get a scolding for forgetting something

But you might not get homework in every class
You only get homework after the lesson is completed
I guess it might be a difference in climate
No snow shoes in Greece
In India as well you are always wearing shoes
If you are in a city where it rains heavily you wear your normal shoes than you wear gum boots over them and remove them before entering class

I just moved to a bigger city (earlier lived in a small village) in Germany and the difference in the demeanour of strangers while commuting is very different
In the small village I used to live, people always greeted and it was a very nice gesture
But here that it is not the case
I am used to so much that I greet people and in reply I get stares
I think waiter/service industry not being thrilled is very common in Europe for some reason
And it does spoil the holiday mood

During the height of rock music in 70s and 80s in US and Britain what genre of music was the most popular in your country ?
But was this the most popular genre ?
I like this
Was music from Brazil popular in Portugal in that era ?
That song from Katri Helena sounds very Russian
Thanks for this
Was this dominant music genre in your country in the 70s and 80s ?
:) Reminds me of the russian song "Those were the days" from Mary Hopkins
Amplified melodious vocals with violin accompaniment
Sounds French

An an Indian I visited Romania in 2017 having toured the known places like except for Bucharest, which did not suit me that well; compared with Cluj Napoca or Brasov
Overall, I felt people were staring at me, maybe due to my skin colour which is brown and not white
Girls were giggling behind my back
Some thought I was a gypsy when I was walking in a tee and shorts
I felt it's a nice and beautiful country
Lots of untouched forest across the hills
Lots of greenery and beach bumping going on in Constanta
Maybe the Romanians don't travel much outside of Romania that much, so I feel maybe that restricts their view of the world
Somehow I realized there's a big beef between Hungary and Romania and not surprised, to see that it was Romanians who disliked Hungarians with a passion
&#x200B;
P.S. Romanian girls are mind blowingly hot
I'd say that even after many chicks made fun of me behind my back
mate , anything with gummies on it can never be inconveniently big , only inconveniently small
I read on his Wikipedia page that his party lost Ankara and Istanbul and this could mean his days are numbered,is that true
Thing is, an average person doesn't care for anything outside his/her home
Do you think people in Europe would know that the country India is not one homogenous chunk
It is, if not more, as diverse as the whole of Europe
And still, people just know curry, Bollywood and brown people
Of course
Also Angry Birds
Is that true outside of Dublin as well
So is the treasury just really full right now
Is this true for Ireland as well
That Britain was the first and only colonizer of India
In reality, the first European power who landed on the shores of Southern India were the Portugese
A certain Vasco da Gama
Infact, it was established through DNA tracing, that they were ones who first bought tobacco plantations to the subcontinent
It was later followed by the Dutch; The Dutch East India company, but later on they focused on then East Indies (Indonesia)
Then, followed by the British, who actually should thank the Portugese because Portugal was at war with Spain
So what the portugese did in mainland Europe was they wedded off Catherine of Portugal to Charles the second of England; and getting parts of insular land in the Indian peninsula as dowry while the portugese controlling the main and larger ports on the coasts
That marked the reason for the English to actually come and check it out
&#x200B;
And the rest is .... well, a very bloody history which has ramifications to this day
Yeah but the first three are actually nice on some level
Surely that was sheer idiocy, not betrayal
>for no other reason than to seize the church’s riches
Stealing from the biggest scam in history is basically the best reason
You lost goa in a war with a newly independent india too
you made indian farmers in bihar and bengal grow that opium instead of food
You can guess what happened next
I would say giving weapons and money to mujahideens to fight the commies but this is cool too
american has never been too keen to learn about places they meddle in
it was a proxy war through pakistan, a country ruled by a religious fanatic president that tranferred all the weapons to the fundamentalists instead of ahmed shah masood
The point was not to help the afghans but to defeat those damn commies
Otherwise you could have helped masood during the afghan civil war but you didn't because your work was done
I am saying this because this incident has had impact on my country too and killed countless people due to acts of wahabi terrorism
no warring party would mind the interference in their favour in any situation
I just meant it was not a benevolent act
The goal was to bleed out the russians like they bled america in vietnam
But this proxy war has had tremendous butterfly effect that most of the world is reeling under
>but of course no one seems to complain about us taking Saddam down a peg in the First Gulf War
Because your war machine does good too, sometimes
It depends on the situation, like the second iraq war
There is a reason world supported the first one and not the second
That's fine cause you guys got real bands
Amo Linguam Latinam, sed ea est mortua

This is known as ludo in India
In India also called ludo
Very popular recently as mobile game in South Asia
Edit : Just checked the English modified the medieval Indian game Pachisi into ludo
Now even Indians have forgotten about Pachisi and only Ludo is known
Can confirm, have seen
Noy exactly a sect of buddhism tho, Jainism existed for centuries before Buddha was born, and became popular in a recognisable form about a century before Buddhism became a thing
South Asians also eat dinner quite late, I wonder if well-spiced food does that to you

We have a few good prog bands that are a mixture of indian classical + rock/metal
These are my favorite bands
Agam
Mother Jane
Bhayanak Mauth (metal)
that Dwight got Nate to do it is the best part, and he even showed up for the party afterwords in partially rubbed off blackface
Not until they upgrade to pentagrams
Croatia : I was travelling solo and I was in Dubrovnik for three days
Had a very stringent budget and stayed quite far from the city, so I had to eat outside in the noons
I found this quite amazing place, where they sold bread rolls with fish and other stuff for very low price and it was delicious
After having it for the first time, I spoke the chef and asked him about the recipe
He told me that they used some Mexican sauce which gave that distinct taste
I went back again for two days to have my lunch there and on the last day he gave me a small bottle of that sauce
This is not chaotic
You have clearly not  been to India
That would be great
The band "Michael Learns To Rock" was quite popular in Asia
Planning on moving to the Baltics in 2020
Would be landing in Vilnius, Lithuania
I likened that place when I went to attend an underground music festival when I was backpacking in 2017

I can't say I really understand the Crimea debate
Was there not a referendum that said that Crimea overwhelmingly wanted to be part of Russia
Sure it could have been faked but I think most people in Crimea are ethnic Russians so maybe they did not even need to
I think that there is some international law about self-determination or something
That does sound like a big problem but in the event that the people of Crimea do actually want to be in Russia then to be honest I don't see that much of a problem
Yeah that does sound like a bad idea, but what I'm talking about is basically hypothetical
If we somehow knew for a fact that the majority of Crimea wants to be in Russia, then what reason would there have been to stop them
Alright then
That does make sense
Thanak you for explaining it

The Romans were actually pretty lenient when it come to enforcing social and cultural norms on their colonies
For the most part, they allowed the local elites to rule the colonies under the supervision of a Roman governor
The Romans were also keen learners who often encorporated the culture of their colonies, namely Greece, into their own culture, and that's how Hellenic culture emerged
Ah ok, got you
Although I don't see how Hellenic culture preceded Rome, maybe you mean the Roman empire
I think that depends on what you mean by Hellenic culture (I also think the term "Hellenistic" might be more appropriate)
Some authors date it between the death of Alexander in 323BC and the emergence of the Roman empire in 27BC
But the book I was reading, The Roman Republic by Michael Crawford, seemed suggest that it began with the interaction between Romans and Greeks in the 3rd century BC
>"If one looks at the two centuries between the Second Punic War and the age of Cicero, the impression is of an enthusiastic borrowing of Greek artistic and intellectual skills, slowly leading to the emergence of a developed Latin culture; the central period of Hellenization of the Roman oligarchy was precisely the period when it was locked in escalating internal competition which finally destroyed the system
" - Michael Crawford
I'm obviously not suggesting that there was no culture in ancient Greece before the arrival of the Romans
I think the difference we have is mainly sematic
When I'm using the term "Hellenic" I'm referring to a particular period of Greek history which oversaw the borrowing of Greek artistic and intellectual skills and resulted in the formation of a Graeco-Roman society

The first part doesn't really explain it all - what is the Indo-Gangetic plain, but fields mostly used for agriculture
France used to have 30m back when England had 8m and the Holy Roman Empire had 20m. How and why the French stopped proliferating between the revolution and the second world war is pretty interesting, and a return to partible inheritance is probably the most easily described component
The argument therein is that, post revolution, families had to offer each son a fraction of the father's land, and therefore tried to avoid having an abundance of sons to avoid dividing the land up into less and less efficient strips
ah yes, those famous wars in which France was the only participant
What about Russia, playing as a part of the Russian Mafias
I don't get the "AEIOU" ?
"Slutstation" is my favorite
It was Muslim-Christian not just Turk-Greek
Albanians, Bosniaks, Pomaks etc moved to Turkey en masse while Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians, Syriacs etc settled in the Balkans or the ME
Not if you draw the southern hemisphere at the top
Ok what
Up and down on a map are arbitrary
Umm, you do realise that North is not 'up' right
'East' and 'west' are terms again
If you have a clockwise N-E-S-W orientation and reverse N and S, E and W will also be reversed, if you want the same clockwise orientation
Again, arbitrary
Also, there is nothing 'natural' or 'easier to visualise' about this particular representation
It seems so only because you are used to looking at it that way
I mean, yes
I didn't mean East or West would be at the top
I agree that North or South would
I wasn't implying that South had an equal probability to be at the top
I was only suggesting that the statement about the map being 'easier to look at' is mistaken
Kids playing without mobile phones and other unnecessary tech connectivity
Same for adults
Idk if Indians can answer this but
Here u go—
Pakistan
Bangladesh
Sri Lanka
China
(Honourable mentions: Portugal and Russia)
I would probably replace Sri Lanka with Iran given the massive influence Persian culture had on North India's languages, food, music, architecture, philosophy, etc
Persian was basically the lingua francia of India until the 17th-18th century when it was gradually replaced by Hindi-Urdu
Portuguese were the first of the colonies, introduced the printing press and missionaries etc coming via Goa (Vasco da Gama)
French is AFTER that (in Pondicherry)
And I have seen the Dutch only a comparitivel fewer times in my history book
Spain was never there pragmatically
Russia helped a LOT in industrialization of India after independence
The top institutions like IITs were set up by them, then there's steel plants etc
and we have some russian influence on our Constitution as well, if not much
So yeah hence Russia
(in modern history ofc)
I thought I'd mention Persia but it wasn't restricted to one particular defined region as of then, which is why i didn't. Otherwise yeah of course Persian influence with so many Sultanates especially in the north India
Yeah, I don't think the Persianised cultures had much of an impact on South Indian culture
Just anecdotally speaking, I've been listening to Carnatic music and the songs are mainly written in Dravidian languages with some Sanskrit influence
Meanwhile Hindustani music is written in Prakrit derived languages with heavy Perso-Arabic influence
Oof, (I laughed at that)
I mean yeah we recognize the Dutch colonies as well, but the Dutch influence was comparatively VERY less
Yeah but I mean a significant of it did too when all of India was under Mughals
But yeah, I totally understand what Ur trying to say
But it's just that Persia in a holistic approach was a region
Only saying Iran now won't actually encapsulate the area which was earlier Persia
No, I didn't really mean Persian in a territorial sense
I was talking more in terms of the language, philosophy and culture that we inherited from our interactions with Persianised Turko-Mongols
Although Iran did lose its far flung provinces it was at the heart of a cultural ethos for many centuries until it was displaced by various European powers
Yes
Words right outta my mouth

Medvedev,right
He seems very much like a wolf in sheep's clothing kinda guy

He seems more like a Putin loyalist,he probably agreed to this new government overhaul
Isn't the correct way of putting it, that Hitler was a Volksdeutsch who thought it was awful that there wasn't a country for all Volksdeutsch, and so he took power in (Klein)Deutsches Reich to create the Grossdeutsches Reich at all costs
I get why modern Germans and Austrians shun the Volksdeutch concept, but ping ponging Hitler between two nationalities seems like a waste of time

Without a doubt, it would be Bruges - Amsterdam - Rome - Dubrovnik - Budapest
PS: Based on my personal experience after backpacking across 20 European countries
PPS: Visiting just 5 cities does not do justice to another 50 beautiful cities in Europe such as: Barcelona, Nice, Marseilles, Brussels, Munich, Krakow, Zagreb, Berlin, Ljubljana, Salzburg, Vienna, Rotterdam, Oslo, Copenhagen
THE LIST GOES ON
Both Bruges and a nearby place called Ghent are absolute beauties
The thing is most of the tourists in Belgium tend to visit Brussels and this leaves Bruges and Ghent a little less explored, although these have also become a major tourist hotspot now
Still worth visiting

Do you have lockers for students in your schools ?
In India we bring in school bags containing books for that day
No concept of lockers
So how do you carry books ?
>To my knowledge, later students got their books split in smaller tomes, so they could carry only 1/3 of the pages to school
That's actually a very cool idea
But I don't how much it would affect the publishing costs
How many did you bring on average ?
Wait . What ? A tea kettle ?
Now I want to know who is the guy on the wall
How many books you had to carry on average ?
How much did you carry ?
Hom many books do you usually carry in your backpack ?
How do you carry books ?
If we used it in our school they'll penalize us for using school electricity lol

I just moved to a bigger city (earlier lived in a small village) in Germany and the difference in the demeanour of strangers while commuting is very different

I am used to so much that I greet people and in reply I get stares

During the height of rock music in 70s and 80s in US and Britain what genre of music was the most popular in your country ?
But was this the most popular genre ?
I like this
Was music from Brazil popular in Portugal in that era ?
That song from Katri Helena sounds very Russian
Thanks for this
Was this dominant music genre in your country in the 70s and 80s ?
:) Reminds me of the russian song "Those were the days" from Mary Hopkins
Amplified melodious vocals with violin accompaniment
Sounds French

An an Indian I visited Romania in 2017 having toured the known places like except for Bucharest, which did not suit me that well; compared with Cluj Napoca or Brasov
Overall, I felt people were staring at me, maybe due to my skin colour which is brown and not white
Girls were giggling behind my back
Some thought I was a gypsy when I was walking in a tee and shorts
I felt it's a nice and beautiful country
Lots of untouched forest across the hills
Lots of greenery and beach bumping going on in Constanta
Maybe the Romanians don't travel much outside of Romania that much, so I feel maybe that restricts their view of the world
Somehow I realized there's a big beef between Hungary and Romania and not surprised, to see that it was Romanians who disliked Hungarians with a passion
&#x200B;
P.S. Romanian girls are mind blowingly hot
I'd say that even after many chicks made fun of me behind my back
mate , anything with gummies on it can never be inconveniently big , only inconveniently small

Do you think people in Europe would know that the country India is not one homogenous chunk
It is, if not more, as diverse as the whole of Europe
And still, people just know curry, Bollywood and brown people
Of course
Also Angry Birds
Is that true outside of Dublin as well
So is the treasury just really full right now
Is this true for Ireland as well
That Britain was the first and only colonizer of India
In reality, the first European power who landed on the shores of Southern India were the Portugese
A certain Vasco da Gama
Infact, it was established through DNA tracing, that they were ones who first bought tobacco plantations to the subcontinent
It was later followed by the Dutch; The Dutch East India company, but later on they focused on then East Indies (Indonesia)
Then, followed by the British, who actually should thank the Portugese because Portugal was at war with Spain
So what the portugese did in mainland Europe was they wedded off Catherine of Portugal to Charles the second of England; and getting parts of insular land in the Indian peninsula as dowry while the portugese controlling the main and larger ports on the coasts
That marked the reason for the English to actually come and check it out
&#x200B;
And the rest is .... well, a very bloody history which has ramifications to this day
Yeah but the first three are actually nice on some level
Surely that was sheer idiocy, not betrayal
>for no other reason than to seize the church’s riches
Stealing from the biggest scam in history is basically the best reason
You lost goa in a war with a newly independent india too
you made indian farmers in bihar and bengal grow that opium instead of food
You can guess what happened next
I would say giving weapons and money to mujahideens to fight the commies but this is cool too
american has never been too keen to learn about places they meddle in
it was a proxy war through pakistan, a country ruled by a religious fanatic president that tranferred all the weapons to the fundamentalists instead of ahmed shah masood
The point was not to help the afghans but to defeat those damn commies
Otherwise you could have helped masood during the afghan civil war but you didn't because your work was done
I am saying this because this incident has had impact on my country too and killed countless people due to acts of wahabi terrorism
no warring party would mind the interference in their favour in any situation
I just meant it was not a benevolent act
The goal was to bleed out the russians like they bled america in vietnam
But this proxy war has had tremendous butterfly effect that most of the world is reeling under
>but of course no one seems to complain about us taking Saddam down a peg in the First Gulf War
Because your war machine does good too, sometimes
It depends on the situation, like the second iraq war
There is a reason world supported the first one and not the second
That's fine cause you guys got real bands

This is known as ludo in India
In India also called ludo
Very popular recently as mobile game in South Asia
Edit : Just checked the English modified the medieval Indian game Pachisi into ludo
Now even Indians have forgotten about Pachisi and only Ludo is known

Noy exactly a sect of buddhism tho, Jainism existed for centuries before Buddha was born, and became popular in a recognisable form about a century before Buddhism became a thing

Not until they upgrade to pentagrams
Croatia : I was travelling solo and I was in Dubrovnik for three days
Had a very stringent budget and stayed quite far from the city, so I had to eat outside in the noons
I found this quite amazing place, where they sold bread rolls with fish and other stuff for very low price and it was delicious
After having it for the first time, I spoke the chef and asked him about the recipe
He told me that they used some Mexican sauce which gave that distinct taste
I went back again for two days to have my lunch there and on the last day he gave me a small bottle of that sauce
This is not chaotic
You have clearly not  been to India
That would be great
The band "Michael Learns To Rock" was quite popular in Asia
Planning on moving to the Baltics in 2020
Would be landing in Vilnius, Lithuania
I likened that place when I went to attend an underground music festival when I was backpacking in 2017

I can't say I really understand the Crimea debate
Was there not a referendum that said that Crimea overwhelmingly wanted to be part of Russia
Sure it could have been faked but I think most people in Crimea are ethnic Russians so maybe they did not even need to
I think that there is some international law about self-determination or something
That does sound like a big problem but in the event that the people of Crimea do actually want to be in Russia then to be honest I don't see that much of a problem
Yeah that does sound like a bad idea, but what I'm talking about is basically hypothetical
If we somehow knew for a fact that the majority of Crimea wants to be in Russia, then what reason would there have been to stop them
Alright then
That does make sense
Thanak you for explaining it

The Romans were actually pretty lenient when it come to enforcing social and cultural norms on their colonies
For the most part, they allowed the local elites to rule the colonies under the supervision of a Roman governor
The Romans were also keen learners who often encorporated the culture of their colonies, namely Greece, into their own culture, and that's how Hellenic culture emerged
Ah ok, got you
Although I don't see how Hellenic culture preceded Rome, maybe you mean the Roman empire
I think that depends on what you mean by Hellenic culture (I also think the term "Hellenistic" might be more appropriate)
Some authors date it between the death of Alexander in 323BC and the emergence of the Roman empire in 27BC
But the book I was reading, The Roman Republic by Michael Crawford, seemed suggest that it began with the interaction between Romans and Greeks in the 3rd century BC
>"If one looks at the two centuries between the Second Punic War and the age of Cicero, the impression is of an enthusiastic borrowing of Greek artistic and intellectual skills, slowly leading to the emergence of a developed Latin culture; the central period of Hellenization of the Roman oligarchy was precisely the period when it was locked in escalating internal competition which finally destroyed the system
" - Michael Crawford
I'm obviously not suggesting that there was no culture in ancient Greece before the arrival of the Romans
I think the difference we have is mainly sematic
When I'm using the term "Hellenic" I'm referring to a particular period of Greek history which oversaw the borrowing of Greek artistic and intellectual skills and resulted in the formation of a Graeco-Roman society
