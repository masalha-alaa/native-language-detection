We have never been a proper democracy
First we were a kingdom before Ottoman occupation, when we freed ourselves we became a kingdom again, then Yugoslav kingdom, then WW2 happened, the leaders would rig elections, have full media control etc, when Yugoslavia fell apart we thought we would have democracy again, nope same things as what happened in Yugoslavia are still happening
Once some dudes transported bodies of 86 Albanians in a truck, some fucked up shit
Truly horrible shit happened in the Balkans during the 90s, no one should've lived through it
Except the KLA, fuck them
Albania was guilty for bombing of Serbia and Montenegro in 1999 (I'm Serbian, not Albanian)
Serbia is one now to
The reason we aren't ranked as one by these western indexes is the west likes Vucic, he wants to join the EU and recognise Kosovo, the west wants this, most of Serbia doesn't
Tacno kako si reku
Problem je da SAD i ostale zapadne zemle se prave ko da vi nista niste radili
My grandfather was killed by the partizans for fighting against the Germans with the Chetniks
He killed 45+ Nazis, blew up one German tank, and before the war had built a whole fucking village with only one of his friends and my father (his son), that didn't matter to the partizans, he was a capatalist who saw through their lies and saw they were treacherous barbarians who didn't give a shit about the country, only about establishing communism
He needed to die
All Balkan countries do
Probably because nationalists are still pissed of about the Ottomans
>I think many people also don't know how cruel the war actually was
I'm not sure which country officially has to take the blame (since it was probably only a few sick individuals behind it all)
Yep
Under 100 people a country were behind all of it
All countries involved should take blame
>A lot of muslim(?) people were put in concentration camps, a lot of lives were destroyed and, since the war only ended in 1995, a lot of people (e.g. in Bosnia and Herzegowina) are still struggling to this day with either trauma from getting raped or having their families slaughtered or having no existential perspective in life or anyone to talk to
They just have to endure their negative thoughts while trying to get by
I understand their pain, I had to go through the same things when most of my family was killed on Kosovo or by NATO bombs
Nobody should have to go through this
> I think many people also don't know how cruel the war actually was
what are you on about
Pretty much every adult in Europe and North America knows about it
With the new technologies, it was literally the most covered war in history until the Syrian war
There are constant news about it to this day
Not really
Right now we are back to peaceful protests, this is good as I don't want the government harming inocents
Hopefully we will manage to take Vucic off
Also I don't think a country with a monarch that has actual power can be a full democracy
>We were a fairly solid democracy, especially by the standards of the times, under the Karađorđević
Yeah but I meant we weren't a proper democracy on today's standards
Back then it was considered good
Jesus that's a lot for a place with only 1k people
We already are controlled by other countries to much, joining the EU will let EU countries control us even more
I will be easier for them to pressure us into recognising Kosovo if we are in the EU
Some people don't want anything to do with NATO countries because of the '99 bombings (these are just idiotic ultra nationalists)
Our almighty, glorious leader Vucic has already struck a deal so whenever refugees go through the country to try to get to the EU we give them documents, so when they go to the EU illegally, the process is to send them back to the last country they got documents in
So we get a shitload of refugees, to many
We want to get rid of this deal, if we join the EU there will be no way to get rid of it
I have recovered now as it was over 20 years ago, but I had to go to lots of therapy in the first few years
BTW it is Herzegovina not Herzegowina
Yeah, that is a good point
Yeah ok, I thought it would be the same for all non-Serbo-Bosno-Croat, whatever the fuck you want to call the language
In the native language it is Hercegovina, but in English Herzegovina so I thought it would be same in Germans etc
Easy one,Croatia
Albania I'd say
Yep
We're really close to illegalizing free speech but those damn protestors keep using it
Bosnia and Hercegovina has free primary and secondary school
Serbia had that right in 1918
Lenin died in 1924
Forming of an empire
When we fought for more autonomy and better rights in the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813), and after a few years had the opportunity to get that autonomy, but Russia, an ally of ours, told us to continue fighting for complete independence with their help, which originally went great but then they fucked us over and after even more years of fighting they offered us the same autonomy we could have gotten before
Of course we declined and continued fighting for independence, Russia pulled out of the war and in the end we had even less rights than before the uprising
(Got actual independence 70 years later)
Bulgaria attacking us without a declaration of war in WW1
When we signed no attack treaty with Hitler allowing his troops to pas through our land only to see some students supported by Britain organise protests against it
Ah yes, the Prussians
How does the average Albanian see the time where he lead the country
Im really curious
Only for it to collapse 25 years later, we were doing better as a Kingdom or Great Principality or even a Despotate
Bulgaria also attacked us in the middle of the night, without declaring war, starting the second Balkan war
We are told in school that the Prusains were catolised and germanized
Very informative answer
Thank you very much
I saw that
It's really good and shows a different perspective then what you'd usually see in the news
Bro it's ok
I never understood people who will hate you because you come from a certain country
None of us chose where we were gonna be born, and we shouldn't hate each other because of what our governments do
We are all just humans and that should be the most important thing
It's hard to say for sure
I have problems when I find some information online, it can be pretty hard to translate technical terms to serbian
Like woodworking, machining or building terms
I'd say this is in part because of my over-exposure to english, but part of it is because my native language internet is almost imaginary
It's probably not good for the ol' noodle
Anyway I feel like I can deal with it, but if have to speak english for more than one day it kind of becomes stressful for me
There is an enormous gap between this internet usage of a language and the real deal
Anyway, I really would like it if there was a way to fit another language through my thick skull, I would love the change in perspective
Generally i don't like it, but my accent earned me a lots of tips during work & travel summer in USA (i worked as a waiter)
People overseas really liked it
Wait, so iPhone is more popular in the US fhan Samsung Galaxy Note, for example
I was forced one time to use iMac Air for few months, and it was a real torture, so limited so closed ecosystem, like made only for surfing the internet and social networks - piece of crap put in shiny box
I always assumed iPhones are the same - overpriced user friendly nacely packaged gadgets for shallow persons who use them as status symbol
Because most android flagship phones like s20 ultra or p40 pro have much better specs than iphones and are much cheaper
I imagine it's because of Android's variety
I was really shocked when I saw how much teens have iPhones in the US (I was an exchange student)
Honestly they cost as much as premium android phones nowadays
Hm, never knew that
I always assumed iPhone is reach kids shiny toy, to be honest
My town because its the poorest town in my country and my country is the poorest in europe
Judging from the name, is it a polluted slum
Which town
Everyone in my country says the opposite
In my country average wage is 410 dollars idk about other countries
Average wage in Moldova is around 440 dollars per month and here 410 dollars per month so no
Average wage in Bosnia is 805 dollars per month and in Albania 452 dollars per month so both have lower wage than Serbia
Gas is about 1
4 dollars per liter so not so good
Oh sorry 410 dollars is on the south of Serbia where i live i switched places of that and average in whole country, in whole country is around 700 dollars [here] is the source but its in Serbian
90% of the things are imported so take any country prices that makes the products (like usa) and make it 40% more expensive
I live in part of city where every elevator is built during communist times
Some brown some grey
An underperforming entry-level employee who tells his family he's a team leader in his department who can't get a raise because his boss hates him
That one gossip girl who knows everything about everyone
Goes to smoke breaks frequently
Something always bothers her
Serbia's the guy that is always looking for the best employee above them and wants to develop a good enough relationship with them to get promoted without actually doing any work
security guard
A minimum wage intern that steals Germanys money when no one is looking
How do u add that blue thing next to your name
Sorry, I'm new to reddit
Nailed it
Thanks
Totally, i speak in somewhat mixed accent (non-rhotic though, because those American r's twist my tongue if i speak fast) which tends to lean more on British or American side depending on the context and current influence
But i use mostly British spelling (theatre, colour
), because of school days,  and words tend to be absolutely random mix of American and British ones (sometimes i say sidewalk and sometimes pavement, apartment or flat, elevator or lift
I'm most often not even aware if some word is British or American
Considering phrases, i tend to pick up both, but i'm aware that some that i use a lot are British  (Mate, fucking hell, 'a'ight mate
', shambolic, bollocks, mental
Thank r/soccer for that currently, as well as my love towards Guy Richie movies and ''Only Fools and Horses'' earlier in my life
Don't really know what you are talking about
In my elementary school I had my English classes right, tho I couldn't wait for breaktimes
I can read well, tho I need my glasses for that, and I can also talk normally with anyone when we are walking on the sidewalk
When I'm home in my flat, which I can get to using my elevator, I often speak English over my native language
So have I got any English mix ups
No, I don't think I do
In all honesty I wish I would use British terms instead of American ones, but their media influence was too high on me
So you're basically Canadian
We are having a bad migrant crisis and it started about 2 weeks ago
You didn’t hear anything because our government doesn’t want you to, it’s pretty complicated, they don’t respect the police clock, or whatever you call it in english, and police isn’t doing anything, they got the masks for covid-19 before us, and masks they get are better quality then what we can get of buy and there is a lot more to say but u really can’t type it all
Here we have a naming convention to add suffixes to any word to make it a name
4 most popular suffixes of the top of my head are: bran(defender) slav(glory) rad(work) mir(peace)
There are some exotic names created this way which are considered rare and old timey
Srbobran (serb-defender) Srbomir (peace serb) Srboslav (glory serb) Milorad (glad to work)
Huh
wasn't Anahita also a Persian goddess
EDIT: Yep
Interesting
I'd say Bendegúz. Also sounds kinda funny
My favorite is still Dragodrag
I met a Srbobran a couple of years ago, definitely still used as a name
Rare AF though
Only ever met him
Not really, one of the more popular names right now
That's the cherry on top
It sounds kind of funny on it's own
Just my personal favorite
It's only my user name
And I know I chose it on purpose
Portuguese sound like Spanish except the person talking is having a stroke
According to the international polls, Serbs are statistically the most hospitable nation in the world
This custom is highly implemented in the legacy and can be traced to the ancient Slavic belief that the host wouldn’t gain any favor of gods if he didn’t show hospitality to a guest
The only Serbian word that is accepted and used across the world is “vampire”.
The Serbian clock-making industry is even older than the world-famous Swiss one
The Serbs had their own clock 600 years before the Swiss did
Ancient Belgrade
Belgrade is one of the oldest cities in Europe, with excavations confirming that the settlements continuously existed here for at least 7000 years
Not far from Belgrade center, at the outskirts of the city, one can find remnants of two of the most prominent cultures in Bronze Age – Vinča and Starčevo cultures
These cities were pioneers in trade throughout Europe and the Middle East, and their potential was in trade with volcanic glass – obsidian
Serbs gave to the world some of the most respecting scientists ever: Nikola Tesla, a wonder-man whose ingenious inventions are still being ahead of time; Mihajlo Pupin, physicist and chemist whose ideas on telecommunications are still breathtaking; Milutin Milankovic, mathematician, astronomer, climatologist, geophysicist, civil engineer whose climatological researches spread all over the solar system and inventor of the most accurate calendar with declination of only 2,75 seconds per astronomical year
We are the world's biggest exporter of raspberries
We use 2 alphabets (Cyrillic and Latin)
18 Roman emperors were born in modern day Serbia, the most in any country after of course Italy
We lost a battle where we had 50k-70k men and the Ottomans had 800 (I can explain in replies if someone's interested)
The only non-American flags that were ever flown on the White house are Serbia's and France's.
We destroyed Bulgaria in a battle /s. Lol
I just had to say that
Actual list
One of the first civilisations was in Serbia (located in lepinski Vir)
We won against 3 armies at once in WW1 (after retreat)
Tesla
We managed to free ourselves from the Ottomans
We won both Balkan wars
TIL luxemburg has its own language
is it similar to german
question: in what language are guvermnet papers
is it in most common language of that place
I am confusion
That is a wrong way to spell Edison
Serbia's flag was flown in 1918 because of WW1, and France's in 1920
[Wikipedia]
I saw a similar story on Twitter a couple of days ago
Basically, they're saying child protection services will take away people's kids if they're aren't vaccinated (which is now mandatory, by the way) and then "sell" them to people from Western Europe (among them to gay couples)
Part of the story is from a 2 year old article and a part is from a person on Twitter claiming social services are currently asking around if children have been vaccinated
I didn't expect that fake news/conspiracy theories in Bulgaria and Serbia are so similar, although it makes sense
We have child protection services
I knew about the social services, that basically do nothing and leech money, but department for children is a new one for me
I know one very popular around the south is that schools are forcing meditation on children so they would turn them homosexual and non-Christian, meanwhile HAARP is being used to disrupt the weather and cause floods so we would starve or get cancer by eating GMO foods and eventually die off from either non-reproduction, due to homosexuality, or starvation
Everything conducted by Brits and Americans
I also heard that chemtrails spray homosexuality on all of us as well
But child protection services
Baffling
Okay, they're probalby not called child protection services, they're called social services
Italia is missing to me, feeling sad because at the moment travelling is not good idea
I greet you very much from Novi Sad, and dream of Italian coffee and Renaissance buildings
Also, this is hard
My brain is now little scrambled
Don’t live in EU couny but im totally on EU side,this is disrespectful from usa
the US should never have gotten visa-free access
'At one point someone is going to say that they have to take their parrot out for a walk
' Aleksandar Vučić while talking about curfew hours during the 'Rona pandemic
Link below:
He is not a politician but a doctor and he was speaking on national television about the virus and said that its the funniest virus ever and that we can go to Milano to buy clothing on sale, and then like in 5 days we were in lockdown
Former president Tomislav Nikolic, being an irredeemable boomer when it comes to technology, the internet and such, once famously said *"I'd comment on social media too, but I don't know their phone number"* because he thought he needed to physically, like, I guess dial, say Facebook or Twitter up and ask someone in some call center to leave a comment
Great times

There were only questions
Ah yes, questions
That's Mijomir Pelemiš, sadly he works as an infectologist

Well it will as soon as we finish our 3 major high-speed lines:
1: Hungarian border - Belgrade
Part from Novi Sad to Belgrade is almost done, from Subotica to Novi Sad it's still just a plan
2: Belgrade - Nis
3: Nis - Bulgarian border
From there you could connect Sofia, to Kulata / Greek border, and probably to Plovdiv and Turkish border aswell
Just don't let sncf anywhere near this network
Ok, get the tgv, but sncf can't be let in on the project
It's always much more interesting to read about other countries and I pretty much already know what kinds of answers Serbs/Balkan-dwellers give
Very true
Shenanigans
For some reason, I found it hard to believe it's an actual word
Discombobulated
I was like "this is a joke
No way this is a word"
Then later "WHAT
FOR REAL
NO WAAAAY
I couldn't comprehend that Bureau is an english word when i first saw it
Thank you, skyrim
Thank you, cind sir
I love Christmas and Christmas stuff and love to see store selling it
But damn it I can't remember the last time we had a snowy Christmas
Exactly since all Christmas songs sing about snow aswell
There is no really a hatred towards Germans anymore, but they are still remembered as the enemies
Yes, a lot of us still hate your guts
See, of it was just the world wars much less would hate you, but then you backed up the '99 bombings
Nobody here hates you much more than they hate any other NATO country
This is probably a list of the most like and most hated countries
Hated:
Albania
Croatia
Germany
Austria
Liked:
Russia (has saved our ass multiple times)
Greece (only NATO country that didn't bomb us, and we are both orthodox)
Romania (we are literally the only two Balkan countries that don't hate each other)
China (this one is debatable, we hate the Chinese agenda, but recognise they are useful, so this one could go forth most hated as well
Mostly we like then because they are one of the two superpowers that don't recognise Kosovo)
It's zigzaged
As always we are nation of extremes, and everything is black and white
My grandpa always says "When Berlin Wall fell, I knew the dark times are ahead of us
" While my other grandpa kept talking how much of a blast he had working in Germany in the 80s. So who knows
Are they
Where I live everyone's like "Germany is rich, good laws, good people
Yes, true, but it would be unwise to forget that Germany or Germans tried to wipe us out twice in the last century
You could admire the Germans and Germany and be wary of it in the same time
We hate you because of "Gay fart Tony Blair"
If you don't get the reference, our current President (Vucic" wrote a book called "Gay fart Tony Blair" after the '99 bombings
Most of us don't classify it as a country lol
That's why I didn't put it on the list
Wait, Kinder is Italian
My whole life has been a lie
Yeah, Mondelez International
In wealthy countries, it works well
In poor, not so well, but the alternative would have only been worse (for the people)
I'm not sure it's a fair comparison, the economic inequality is vast in the US, but even with it, the US has GDP per capita that is even higher than that of Sweden
As per not wanting to downgrade, the way it works in Serbia (which is by no means a model example, being a poor country) is that all employers are obliged to contribute to public healthcare through taxes, but the good employers on top of that often offer the private health insurance to their employees
Private healthcare here is fancy schmancy - appointments without long waits and sparkly well equipped hospitals, unlike public ones which are understaffed due to the MDs leaving to Germany, long waits, and poor conditions
Here in Serbia in most parts its ok to drink it and we do,but in some parts water isn't drinkable, but i personaly drink tap water
Yes it is very common
We mostly drink from tap water, bottled water is only for when you are in the city and thirsty
NOT
TALK
ABOUT
THE
WARS
A lot of people  here lost people in the Yugo wars, also you will start a shitload of fights
politically: Just stay out of any of it
And if someone present criticizes our own country, don't agree and don't join in
It's our privilege, I criticize my country, not you
socially: Don't create draft, older people will act as if you invited death itself
Don't wear shoes in a house generally, especially not if visiting - even if a host insists you can keep them on
In public transport, never refuse to give your seat to old ladies, pregnant women, women with kid(s), invalids (i mean this is a general thing, i hope
If you're a man going out with woman, never ask to split the bill, it's expected that you pay, not just on a first date
I didn't even know this was a thing
I don't think this is a big taboo for us, except for war veterans obviously, and sometime they give their two cents as well
I'd gladly give my perspective about the wars to anyone genuinely interested
Alexander the Great was North Macedonian
I don't feel like getting banned from another sub today
You guys from Denmark went to school trip in Serbia
What was purpose lol
To show you how country should not be menaged
I only realised on reddit that you don’t have pita sa mesom
You only have burek
We have both
lmao it was only a joke, but this is next level
If by em you mean Albanians, I don't mind them, just hate a few specific ones (which if I talk about people assume I hate all Albanians and am faking and then I get banned)
If you mean Kosovo's independence, 1
It's illegal under every possible law, 2
It's always been part of Serbia 3
Albanians only got majority a very short time ago and only appeared there in the 14th century and until the 1800s Serbs outnumbered them more than 10 to 1
Yea
But we have two different filo dish
Pita, it could be rolled or laminated with filo for pita, and then we have burek, made with filo for burek
UN res 1244, Serbian constitution
This is the first American I have ever seen who has enough common sense to realise this
I read somewhere that Serbia is the least racist country in Europe
How the fuck are you worse than us
Here you literally can not say anything against the government
All our racist energy is directed at Albanians
Lmao i guess
Umm here come the Balkans
Yes
Sometimes gets more than arkward (straight up attacking each other and shit)
I talked to a few Kosovo Albanians but we have a different take on it since we live in Germany
As long as you don't blame or insult anyone it's fine, but I always look to change the subject
It's not awkward tho
>german speaking countries, we are highly aware that we were part of the baddies in WW2
Switzerland
Same with us
if you get rid of the past 30 years
>Aye, everything south of Kolpa river is a mess
It's **Kupa**, you bastard
it sounds like an awful idea honestly
the people who were speeding will continue speeding because the reprecussions are the same and some people who weren't speeding will begin speeding because now they have an extra option
God Bless America
If it counts we bought a fish for our Biology professor to open up instead of having a test
Literally same lmao
Weak
We kiss three times when we meet with new or known people here
Their parents could be bugged, they don't want to take any chances
Srećna Nova godina i Božić onim koji slave :)
There are slim chances EU will survibe this
I do think Orbán has plans for making some cind of "Central European block" with Central European and Balkan countries
But we'll see
How will there possibly be no one else to blame
There will be foreigners, Soros, Brussels, anything but the dictator
That's how this thing works, you don't have people thinking about a problem, you have a process where they will certainly fail to do anything
They will lie about this, then they will find traitors or some other reason - it will never come to accepting responsibility for anything
It would be really nice if I was wrong, but I'm not
Bookmark this post, come back in .. maybe five months
Six
It's almost like I'm psychic
It might survive, yeah, but without some members
Speaking of Orban, it seems he wants to bring Slovenia and Serbia into V4, and form his block inside EU
V4 and Balkan states I think
My guy Europe's border is the Ural Mountains
In no geographical way is Poland in the east
Yeah there's this one artist called Jala Brat, and the other Buba Corelli
And it's not just me, I don't think there is anyone who understands them
(Btw they are not foreigners)
Most american movies where someone is speaking "serbian" : half of the time it's btoken russian, and other half is just random sound (I'm guessing how Americans hear it
And when they get the language right, the tones/pitch accents are completly wrong
In Serbia it's "you'll become a garbage man" or "clean the streets".
That i would dig holes and work in canalisation of some sort of i can correctly translate it
If you don'tstudy you will became a bum just like our neighbour [insert name here]
That we are racists
We are not, we only hate our neighbors (Exapt Romania
Everyone loves Romania
That we are all mafia and that it is very dangerous to live here
> "here girls are not easy like in france"
haha
Jesus so many Romanians in one thread talking about electricity
Well I never heard of Greek language, is that a thing
I mean, tha half of math and physics is just GREEEK letter
Ironic because it's much much safer here than in America for example
Yeah, it would be weird to smoke weed while sleeping
It's like you've been waiting to ask this your whole life
Yea, we can't buy guns in Dis
I have another one, would you like Greenland to be independent
Vaccines are mandatory in Serbia aswell
Of course I think you should get vaccinated but for things that you can just naturally overcome isn't necessary and pretty sure they don't force you on those
Was in Greece two years ago, and there was a pizza restourant with a sign saying "You came pizza you tried no"
Besides Novi Sad which is famous for Exit music festival Belgrade is really popular with "splavovi" (rafts on Danube which have 2 floors and fancy atmosphere [some splav images] and it is in top ratings for partying capitals, [lonely planet gave it no1] For foreigners prices are really cheap compared to what they are used to, we are super invested in partying as it can last up to 5 am and then afterparty is also an option
Also foreigners get lots of attention from our girls, both cause we are not so touristy so they are seen as "exotic" (there are also some infamous gold diggers too, it's not all perfect)
We offer many things as city has traditional taverns or kafana, already mentioned splavovi for rnb and popular global hits, rave/edm scene, rock, indie, you name it
And we love drinking, it's almost a national sport
Feel free to come, we are waiting for you with open arms
Belgrade is not trying to move away from it, Belgrade is embracing it
32°C. Not good, not bad
I already experienced worse previous years at this time
Well to cool myself down I have AC, I free water bottles, I have ice creams, also I just completely make the room dark so there's no sun coming in and it gets cold
Rakija in one hand and a Cevap in the other for us Serbs most definitely
My parents are Bosnian Serbs and they feel 100% Serbian
I'm sorry to inform you that you are written in the book of Serbs, so you are 101% Serb
Doesn't matter, you are one of us
And beware, besides basketball, our national sport is to fight with your family over nothing for years and years
I feel it's kid of similar, but hey my country is goung to shit
And this is something you notice, we are getting more homeless people and nuts people in the street
Guess because our healthcare and social programs are going to shit
>**Article 1: Republic of Serbia**
>Republic of Serbia is a state of Serbian people and all citizens who live in it, based on the rule of law and social justice, principles of civil democracy, human and minority rights and freedoms, and commitment to European principles and values
Article 1
Republic of Serbia is a state of Serbian people and all the citizens that live in it, based on the law and social justice, principles of civil democracy, human minority  rights and freedoms and commitment to European principles and values
Art 1
Republic of Serbia is a state of Serbian people and all citizens who live in it, based on the rule of law and social justice, principles of civil democracy, human and minority rights and freedoms, and commitment to European principles and values
I was in Thessaloniki few years ago speaking to some Ukrainian and American dude while on a school trip
Suddenly this old Greek man approaches us and randomly says something along the lines of 'Macedonia is Greek and death to or destroy the false Macedonia'.
I just nodded and smiled
It was so random and bizzare
To be fair I think there was some anti-Macedonian rally in the city at the time as I saw Macedonian Greek flags everywhere but then again Greeks love their flags
Probably Eastern Serbia (Especially Bor and Zajecar cities)
Bor is basically the same as that Greek city you described, while Zajecar has enormous unemployment rate and most of the people there leave the country to find a workplace
Also, Leskovac in Southern Serbia, which was one of the richest cities before WW2, but was tottaly destroyed during the war and didn't recover since
The remaining Serbs living in Kosovo
Sounds a lot like Vojvodina
Is it similar like in Cod black ops lol
I've been to Shkodra and it didn't look that poor to me
We Serbs are very family-friendly people
Well not quite by the meaning
But literally we have a name for every single member of family
Uncle can either be "Stric" (from father's side) or "Ujak" (from mother's side)
Same for Aunt
BUT Uncle is called these ONLY IF he is a brother of either parents
If an Uncle is married to a sister of either of your parents, then he is called "Teča".
It goes both ways
Your niece is not just your niece
It can be "Sestrić" if it's your sister's son, or "Bratić" if it's your brother's son
Of course "Sestričina" or "Bratičina" if they are their daughters
Our ancestors are very important for us
So important that we won't say grand grand grand grandfather, but instead "Askurđel". Infact we can go up to 16 generations backwards and still have unique names for them
You'd think once you wrap your head around who is who you'd be done, BUT you will eventually get married
Now let me tell you that every member has it's name in relation to either husband or wife
Yes, you've read it correctly, EITHER
For example if you happened to be a handsome groom, then your wife's mother is called "Tašta". But if you are a beautiful bride, then your husband's mother is called "Svekrva". Mother-in-law is just way too lazy imo
Does your husband have a brother who is also married
Well then HIS WIFE is your "Jetrva". We can go on and on about this one but I think this is enough :)
The unique feature of my language, that no other *European* language has, is that we have 2 official writing systems
One of which is fully phonetical
Meaning one letter always has exactly one corresponding sound (which is also one of the unique features)
I know about Spanish but there "c", "g" and "y" have different sounds while "h" is not read at all
I'm talking 100% phonetical without exceptions, not even foreign names
Well other Slavic languages have the next one too, but other European languages don't have this feature
One verb from any language can be translated in at least 2 different ways
This is because the continuity of an action is described within the verb itself and not by the tens
For example:
I crossed the street - Prešao sam ulicu
I was crossing the street - Prelazio sam ulicu
Prešao is a form of the verb "Preći", while Prelazio is a form of the verb "Prelaziti". However both are in the same tense
This is also the reason why we only use one past, one present and one future tense (unlike English that has past simple, past continuous, past perfect
We do however have almost as many tenses but we don't use them anymore
What's also interesting is that you can use any tense to talk about any point in time
You can even use imperative
Especially present tense
You can use present tense to talk literally about any point in time, either past or future
We are able to speak or write words with backward-ordered consonants, like “travel = veltra “ and we are able to understand (younger generations at least) what word was it
Nouns, verbs, adjectives, even personal names
Speaking like that is supposed to be cool
(It’s called “šatrovački”)
(Original - šatrovački - literal - slang)
- Zemun - MunZe - city name
- Miloš - LošMi - personal name
- Brate - Tebra - brother - dude
And famous one: Žili mi ruka - literally means “my arm is showing tendons” but what the person was saying is “suck my cock” (liži mi karu)
We actually have lots of fun with it
So do all Slavic languages
I tried reading it, but there is no way to do it hahaha
What does that word mean
Is it easy for you to pronounce it, or is it also a bit challenging
Romanians sure have a blast when visiting Pula, Croatia
Yes it's actually used in everyday speech
Mostly because there is no other "neutral" word for any of them
We always use those
I know about your "dundo" which is used almost exactly as English "uncle", however we always specify the relation
For example "ujak" always means mother's brother and if you'd use it for your uncle from your father's side, it wouldn't make sense
The only thing that is slightly out of use are the names of greater than the 5th generation
We know exactly what "deda" what "pradeda" what "čukundeda" etc
means
Names like "svekrva", "tašta" and even "jetrva" are also used without confusion or sounding like a 70yo grandpa
We don't learn those at school however as it comes naturally for us
Edit: names of each generation's male: otac, deda, pradeda, čukundeda, navrdeda
From here on it goes as: kurđel, askurđel, kurđup, kurlebalo, sukurdov, surdepač, parđupan, ožmikur, kurajber, sajkatav, beli orao
As you can see from the 6th generation names are almost random, and thus less known for an every day speaker
American English has more differences from British English, than Croatian with Serbian and Bosnian
I understand what you're saying, but decision to proclaim those languages as separate is more political than linguistic
Thanks
In Serbian we say "četvrt", which is exactly the same as your "čtvrt". I find it very interesting
Wintertime
It feels more natural to my bio clock
I’m an early riser, but with this summer time schedule, I feel like the day is passing more quickly and I never have enough time
I need more time to adjust then on winter time
Winter time as it's the "real" time
However, I'd have everything start an hour earlier (fuck it maybe 2h) thus in effect having summer time as well
But people would probably say "that's too much effort" or something, so fuck everyone then
[Blooming of the Tisa river] is a phenomenon occurring only once a year when a rare type of mayflies mate just above the river surface
After emerging from the mud of the bottom of the river, adults only have a few hours to mate before they die with the sunset
Consequently, groups of males will frantically try to mate with a female, creating a sight that reminds of blooming flowers
Females will fly 1–3 km before laying their eggs on the river, which then sink to the bottom
The larvae develop in the mud for as long as three years before hatching
[Video of the occurrence
During war with Bulgaria in 1885 we let Red cross pass through our country to help wounded Bulgarians .
Our hospitality
Literally we have a saying that the host knows where you will be seated before you even arrive to his house, which is usually the best one
Then we would ask ya a billion questions likes of "what you want to drink" "are you hungry
No you are bc yer skin and bones
" and such
Funny enough in the middle ages you were obliged by law to show hospitality and if you dont you would get whipped or in rare cases, chopped off yer arm
It took the Serbian army only 18 days to breach the Thessaloniki front in 1918
French, Greek, Italian and British army – although outnumbering Serbian army – didn’t manage to do it in months
The breach of Thessaloniki front meant a complete disaster of Austro-Hungaria and Bulgaria
French general and supreme commander of the Allied armies on Thessaloniki front was overwhelmed with Serbian courage that he declared if he had had such men in other Allied armies – the war wouldn’t even have broken loose
It has been recorded that the Serbian army liberated their homeland so quickly that the allied armies weren’t able to distribute supplies to them so fast
One year after we became a state of our own, we had a debut on Eurovision with the current name (before: Serbia and Montenegro, after: Serbia) and we won
We and Switzerland are the only countries which managed to do that so far
Why do all Romanian names make me go NUMA NUMA YAY, NUMA NUMA NUMA YAY
Congratulations are in order
It's actually pretty similar here we like to drink coffee and do nothing as well
Really wow I did not know that
Do you have a source
I was hoping someone would mention this
I love how everyone picks their own countries
It is pretty obvious that the city should be in Eastern or Southern Europe
I would go for Sarajevo, because it is a mixture of Slavic and Muslim cultures
A 1990s non-existent city in the Federal Republic of The European Union located somewhere around the Adriatic, due to the formation of a unified European state the cultures are all messed up with 50% of the people being Italians while the rest are a mixture of Tourists, corrupt government officials and various European and non-European migrants which together make up this Free city
It would combine elements of Post soviet eastern European run-down industries and western Mediterranean coast cities, a somewhat unusual mix but I believe in the context of a game about crime it would make sense
Balkans and Niko Belic
One word:
BALKANS
Does it have to be modern or not
London, again
Yeah, Rio would be mad with all those favelas and narco cartels
> Sure it would be a fairly small map compared to GTA V but still pretty fun
then make the starting position the East Berlin
Đavolja Varoš (my opinion quite unpopular)
Weird rock formation, nothing much
It’s not expensive, but it’s hard to get there a bit, and then u see literally nothing
Imagine being able to trust your own goverment lmao couldnt imagine that
How the fuck do you not like gulaš
I don't know man, I love Hungarian cuisine, I still haven't tried anything I didn't like
I also like your craft beer scene
As a Serbian
oh boy
can't even begin to look for the actual movies but usually when there is a "Serbian" in an American film, it is a brute, a terrorist or something like that, speaks Russian or gibberish, and has a name that no one who knows anything about Serbia would deem Serbian
Like I remember from about two decades ago one episode of the Outer Limits had a murderous dictator called something like Mistoslav Krupchek, that spoke Russian with an American accent
EDIT: Also the GTA character Niko Bellic is supposedly Serbian
Niko is not a Serbian name or nickname, and while there is a surname Belić exists, Bellic is super weird because there is no double l in Serbian and double letters in general are not common except a few, maybe (4-5) exceptions
EDIT 2: Please stop telling me Nikola is a name in Serbia
I am Serbian and I am aware of this, but Niko is not a common nickname for Nikola
Also, maybe Niko Bellic is not the best example because his nationality is officially not defined
My mistake, somehow I was under the impression it is cannon he is Serbian
Almost any Hollywood movie that has a serb character in it
A they give us cheap Russian accents and B it's almost always putting us in a bad light
Better question would be, is there a show or movie where Serbia (or the Balkans as a whole) *aren't portrayed* in a deeply cringeworthy manner
My thoughts exactly
We have internet
It is easy
Or take 2 famous athletes and combine it ffs
E.g. Novak Jokić is a legit Serbian name
Met a lot if Nikolas not one of them went by Niko
Yeah, Croatian and Serbian are almost the same
And I do not blame people thinking he was Croatian cause Niko can be a Croatian name lol
Anyway I think Niko Bellic is not less weird for Croatians or Russians either
well yes, but no one uses that as nickname, niko is word for no one
>A proper pronunciation would use a hard 'ch'
100% not true his name has ć (soft letter) ch is Č
maybe in bosnia, serb there are little diffrent then here
But thinking biggest mistery is, why the fuck is his cousin roman
wtf is that name i never heard it (best guese its russian like name varation of Romanov)
ik dont worry i am just saying GTA 4 has one of most shit voice acting ever (and a alot stupid things), it would be better for Niko to be just russian
* Not only serbian is shit in game
* Roman is no where near serbian name
* Serbia is not in estern europe
Sorry for rant i just fucking hate that game (its littery pain to play it with sound)
Oh yeah
And Vojvodina is not good enough for you
How insulting
That's cause nobody jokes about it
Everyone wants something that "belongs" to them, and you just can't give everything to everyone
Wait, Western
>reconquering
When did kosovo have that
Want kosovo serbia back then
>It was never ours
Why did you say reconquer then
>If we wanted to take anything back from Serbia
Tf you mean "take anything back" you never had it, Kosovo didn't change its borders a single time for the duration of it being a country
Lack of healthcare, lack of regulations when it comes to basic things (tap water isnt drinkable in many places), proto-fascism, bad education, drinking age, gun laws, circumcision
Quite a few thinkg I would say
Be 16yo; take a photo of your own dick; send it to a 18yo girl;
Go to prison
WTF
All our cities are kind of fucked
Any small village/town are all really nice, plus that's where rakija is mostly made so that ups how good it is a lot
Well the vibe is *completely* different
I think people who like Berlin might not like Potsdam
~~English name~~  american way of pronaunciaction of Scott is prounaunced as serbian word skot (basterd)
Well no, because Scotland is "Škotska" (shcot-skah) in Serbian, and likewise Scottish people are "škoti"
We say it diffrent, we say it Škotska (Š is sh sound)
>No it isn't.  The name "Scott" would in Serbian be pronounced
>skaat
Its not pronaunced Skaat at all its skot
Umm I am pretty sure no one pronounces Scott as "skat". We pronounce Scott and skot the same
Zapravo i ja i ti smo pogresili ali smo ipak ispravni
Skat je britanski, skot je americki nacin izgovora
>Umm I am pretty sure no one pronounces Scott as "skat
Britanci tkao izgovaraju, mada kod nas se gotovo nikada ne prevodi tako
TIL doduse nikog nisam cuo da izgovara Scott kao Skat
[Wiktionary begs to differ] Sounds remarkably similar to skot, the only difference is that Serbian does not have ɒ sound so we use o instead
I'm still hoping to actually move to Greece and run a small B&B on one of the Ionian islands
I don't need much, just to be close to the sea
Southern France for the beaches and nice weather
Germany or Netherlands
Except the quality of life there, I like how fun it is, always something happening and people are awesome
For instance - Norway, yeah it has a pretty good life standard, but it's kind of uneventful and quiet, except that, I like cities and urbanized places more than mountains, forests and other natural goods
I'd love to live in Greece
i'd live in France, but not in Paris rather some city on western coast,
Definitely the Netherlands
Yeah, but nowhere is perfect
Nema loseg vremena, samo nepropisnog oblacenja
I can't understand how people in online games think others don't speak English
Also what cunts, our language is fine thank you very much
Yeah, "sladak/slatka/slatko" - cute, but literally means sweet
If you're still with that guy, and he ever asks if you have something sweet (to eat), say: "Evo, ja sam slatka". That's a classic comeback for that situation, means "Here, I'm cute
You're very much right, but sometimes it's quicker to refer to something in your native language to the other person you're playing with
I sometimes use them, but that is because a Spanish friend introduced them to me, but otherwise I wouldn't have known about them
I'm from Vojvodina (northern Serbia) and my grandparents from both sides had only those kind of decks
(they called them "madjarice" - Hungarian)
In Serbia we have besides Christmas and all other European holidays a Slava which is like a family patron saint that you celebrate with your family and friends and they are usually in late fall or winter, so by drinking and having fun we endure long and cold winters
November-January is the best time of the year for me
Christmas, New Year, 3 birthdays, skiing
It's cold but still very fun
Same for Serbia
You should
Or come here,a peaceful place and stuff is dirt cheap
In Switzerland you would be the avg guy,in Spain on the richer side and in Serbia you would be set for life with everything you wanted
I'm pretty sure it's a hypothetical question to discuss
Never, all the options in my country are moderate right wing or extreme right wing
I’m quite left wing soooooo
Nearly everyone smokes here
I have one of the rare families where no one smokes though
This may be the worse country in Europe when it comes to smoking
You'd pretty often find people smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a day
People start at the very young age
You can see professors and students smoking together in the back of a high school
You can find a loooot of cigarette butts just laying around
And just pretty much everyone is smoking
About 40% of people smoke here
Nobody gives half a shit if you smoke
Here in Serbia most of the smokers start at high school (14-18yo) which is really bad and it's usually because of the effect of the friends
Thankfully I'm not so easy convinsable person
I see it as disgusting, and hate it, but many others don't really care and non-smokers mostly let smokrr friends smoke in their house which is stupid
I have a feeling it depends a bit on your social circle or generation
I think maybe 10% of my friends smoke tobacco
In my family only my dad smokes now
I've never even tried tobacco
Serbia and Russia aren't in the EU
[This] says ours is 40%. Also we aren't in the EU
Same
We'll eventually reunite Yugoslavia in Germany
Oh you are from Siberia
No, I am from Serbia
I heard it’s really dangerous out there in Syria
That we are like the world's biggest exporter of raspberries or something
We're trying to keep up too
Fun fact Serbia will "surpass" Bulgaria in population soon, because we lose less
Rotterdam is the biggest port in Europe
I read tomatoes instead of tornadoes and was soo confused
Why is that man
Not judging or anything, just wondering
Are you afraid people might treat you differently or something else
It's not because of that, those Serbs were always there, but Tito didn't give a shit about ethnic compositions when he was drawing the borders of Yugoslav republics, which is what we have today
That's very impressive and surprising to hear
Mostly around the border with Bosnia
There were like 500k+ before the war, these are the ones that weren't forced to flee to Serbia and stayed
No those are the ones that weren’t forced to flee
Drzi se

I just read the longer comment, that's so sad
Do you identify as a Serb on the census though
Čuvaj se ~~brate~~ sestro, i budi ponos~~a~~na svog porekla, makar mora~~o~~la da ga kriješ u javnosti (to važi za sve, ne samo Srbe)
Oh no, no no no no no
Saying something like that is the easiest way to indirectly commit suicide
That's what I said
You said escape thats not the same mate
Ah izvini, editovao sam komentar kako treba
Yeah you're right, the way I said it looked like they had much choice
Edited the comment
but how's that comparable
Russian doesn't have a standard latin script
When I was in Montenegro a couple of years ago, I've seen two of them on entire beach
Definately depends where
Greece might be the highest IMO
Around 1 in 3
Now mind me I don't go around counting the number if pairs I see its just and estimate
In my 10 years of going to sea, I've seen 10 people being topless
The probably range from 7€-40€. Normal wage is around 400€-500€.
Average wage in town i am is 200 Euros so it's more than half of average monthly wage
I lived with three host families, and have many friends who're exchange students
I know of some VERY crazy stories that happened to both me & my friends but I can't say this is something I ever heard of before
Had the exact same thought
I'd definitely Google them but wouldn't bring it up if it wasn't worrying
I can understand that Middle English excerpt better than the Early Modern one, due to the latter's flowery language
>*Knight there was, and that a worthy man,*
>*That from the time that he first began*
>*To ride out, he loved chivalry,*
>*Truth and honour, freedom and courtesy
>***"Fully worthy" (respected, in high esteem)*** *was he among his lord's* ***men***,
>*And* ***there where*** *he had ridden (no man* ***fairer (more beautiful)****)*
>*As well in Cristendom as in* ***"Heathendom"***,
>*And ever honoured for his worthiness
Bolded is what I changed and am not that certain about
I don't understand the Old English at all, maybe I could guess a word or two
Scots is not hard, but it is about something I already know
There are a few words I wouldn't recognise on their own, but context helps (e.g. *hidlinweys, kythed, sauf,* etc
I knew what *bairn* was beforehand and *tryst* as well, but I didn't know it meant marriage in Scots
First 3 easy
4th is hard and Scottish is easy
Early modern English and middle English without much trouble, Scots i can understand mostly but less than middle English, rest i don't understand anything i can maybe pick up on like every 10th word
I understand Early Modern and Middle English
Aha, and what does "no man ferre" mean
I know, I'm saying I knew what it meant before reading this text
Nah i'd say it more like 60%
This is a speech at the European Council
All the bad rep my country gets, you would think they would send somebody who can actually speaks English
[Vuk Draskovic] speaks on CNN news
vi ar AVR
I mean, it definitely can be a sign of culture
"Speaking Ancient Greek" - he might have been citing Iliad or something
That's still a cool example of being cultured, so may not be the best one for criticism
Welll uhhh
Bosnia
90s, expulsion of the Albanians, Turks and other Muslims in 19th and 20th centuries, expulsion of Germans after WW2
There's the expulsion of the Turks (i.e Sunni Muslims) in the early 19th century, culminating with the Čukur česma incident in 1862 (by which time there wasn't really a presence of civilian Turks in Serbia)
There's the expulsion of the Albanians from Toplica in 1878
The Balkan Wars had some massacres of Albanians as well, and Kosovan villages were razed and later colonized
In World War 2, depends on who we're looking at as the legitimate predecessor of Serbia
The Chetniks massacred thousands of Bosniaks particularly in Sandžak, the Partisans interned the German minority in Vojvodina in concentration camps before sending them all to Germany similarly to what happened in Czechia
And of course, in the 90's you have several massacres against Croat (mostly) POWs, you have Srebrenica where several thousand were killed and other smaller massacres against Bosniaks and the murder of thousands coupled with the displacement of more than a million Albanians in the Kosovo War
Probably the things we did in Bosnia and Kosovo, those are darkest stains on our history
Shit
That wasnt nearly as bad as the bosnian genocide
What did we do to Albania
"Serbs did it
" Is the best defence there is in ex Yu countries, as long as it's a bad thing
So why not lump this one to us too
And it says that these killings were more revenge than a regular crimes for no reason
I didn't know about this
But it seems to have been a back and forth between us for centuries with these sort of events
"say hungarian reports" ahh yes the one country that despised Serbia at that time
We should completely believe what they said
It's not centuries, though
It started with the expulsion of the Albanians from the Toplica region, at the time a majority Albanian region awarded to Serbia at the Congress of Berlin in 1878
It is centuries
A lot of Serbians moved from Kosovo during our migrations north and Albanians moved in and expelled and cleansed Serbs
We came back and did the same thing
Right and right before that they were massacring Serbs as part of the Ottoman army, so it is like he said, a back and forth
That's just not true
The Albanians were not on good terms with the Ottoman Empire at the time
They fought on the side of the Austrians and many of them were also expelled and migrated to Vojvodina after the Great Turkish War, particularly Catholic Albanians who moved to Srem and were Croatized
Albanians who did move to Kosovo in the following 200 years had no such intentions, and saying we did the "same thing" 200 years later is laughable already
Massacring military personnel in times of war (around 5 thousand Serbian soldiers altogether from 1876 to 1878) is light years apart from expelling tens of thousand of civilians (Čedomir Popov mentions 30 thousand) after the war was over
[as i said, too bad history isn't such a narrow thing] It was a back and forth
They mostly started it, then we caught up
Somewhat true but not completely, first they moved and then they converted later during the 18th century
As did many Slavs in the area, who also went on to abuse the Christian population
So it's not a Serbian-Albanian thing, and saying that the expulsion of 1878 is a revenge for those events is all kinds of misleading
Tried to find the source for the first three, listed solely as "Ivanov 2005", looked into some key words particularly this Yashar Pasha (Jašar-paša Džinić) and found [this about the 1830 massacre]
>Kada je u Babinom Mostu, Jašar-paša Džinić hteo (oko 1830) da poruši pravoslavnu crkvu, tome su se usprotivili Albanci iz tog sela
Oni su stali uz svoje komšije Srbe
>*(When Yashar Pasha Džinić wanted to raze the Orthodox church in Babin Most (around 1830), Albanians from that village opposed it
They stood with their Serbian neighbors
So yeah, I would say "too bad history isn't such a narrow thing".
EDIT: Just looked into the source on that one, it would seem it's from the book "Srbi i Albanci kroz vekove" (*Serbs and Albanians Through the Ages*) by Petrit Imami
>During the [Great Austro-Turkish War] Albanian Catholic leaders [Pjetër Bogdani] and [Toma Raspasani] rallied Kosovo Albanian Catholics and Muslims to the pro-Austrian cause
After the war, when Kosovo did not end up part of the Habsburg empire, harsh reprisals followed
Large numbers of Catholics\[2\] and Serbs\[3\] fled north where many "died, some of hunger, others of disease" around [Budapest] After the flight of Serbs, the Pasha of Ipek (Albanian Peja, Serbian Pec) forced Catholic Albanians in the North to move to the now depopulated plains of Southern Serbia, and forced them to convert to Islam there
\[3\]
>Conversion among Catholics in communities of Northern Albania involved males outwardly embracing Islam, often to avoid payment of taxes and other social pressures which in the Ottoman system targeted men while females of the household remained Christian
\[4\] Christian wives were sought by converted Muslim men to retain a degree of Catholicism in the household
\[4\] In 1703 pope [Clement XI] himself of Albanian heritage, ordered a synod of local Catholic bishops that discussed stemming conversions to Islam which also agreed to deny communion to crypto-Catholics in Albania who outwardly professed Islam
\[1\]\[5\] In Northern Albania, conflict with Slavs emerged as an additional factor toward conversion to Islam
\[6\] Sharing the faith of Ottoman authorities allowed northern Albanians to become allies and equals in the imperial system and gain security against neighbouring Orthodox Slavs

As I pointed out to u/Helskrim on another branch of this thread, relations were much worse with the local bureaucracy of the Ottoman Empire than with local Albanian civilians
Of course, every atrocity has its roots which aren't impossible to understand, quite the contrary, it's absolutely necessary
That doesn't mean it wasn't unfair, uncalled for and doesn't leave room for a sort of relativist "it was a back and forth thing" argument that the original commenter tried to make
The revenge was carried out against someone other than the perpetrator
And besides, on a local level, sure, there's always hate underneath the surface and societies turn brutal pretty fast
But I don't even think this is the case here, I think most of the expulsions weren't local skirmishes at all, they were ordered from high ranking generals
I'd be willing to wager they were possibly even unknown by the average Serb (as they are today, from my experience)
No no, I was probably unclear, I think the expulsions of 1878 were orders of high-ranking officials, and were relatively unknown at the time as they still mostly are today
I think we're in luck - they actually mention their reasons
>There were multiple reasons held by the Serbian government for the expulsions
Serbian authorities intended to expel the Muslim population, as they were deemed unreliable and undesirable that needed to be substituted with other inhabitants
\[1\] Retaliation for attitudes held toward [Christians within the Ottoman state] was also used as a motive
\[2\] Prime Minister [Jovan Ristić] wanted a homogeneous country, without Muslims and with a reliable population in the area
\[3\]\[1\] Ristić viewed Albanian populated territories as strategically important and representing a future base to expand into Ottoman Kosovo and Macedonia
\[1\] General [Kosta Protić] who led the Serbian army during the war, did not want Serbia to have "its [Caucasus] as an Albanian minority was viewed as a possible security concern
\[3\]\[1\] Supporting Protić's views for expulsion of the Muslim population, including Albanians, were most of the senior Serbian army officers and Prince [Milan]

"In 1878, following a series of Christian uprisings against the Ottoman Empire, the Russo-Turkish War, and the Berlin Congress, Serbia gained complete independence, as well as new territories in the Toplica and Kosanica regions adjacent to Kosovo
These two regions had a sizable Albanian population which the Serbian government decided to deport
The Serbian Army Commander insisted that Serbia 'should not have its Caucasus' and the Prime Minister argued that the Albanian minority might represent a security concern
In 1909, Serbian intellectual Jovan Hadži-Vasiljević explained that the major motivation for the 1878 deportation was also to 'create a pure Serbian nation state' by 'cleansing' the land of the non-Christians, as 'the great Serbian poet Njegoš argued'. Hadži-Vasiljević was here interpreting Njegoš rather loosely, as Njegoš work focused on the Slavonic Muslims and not on Albanian Muslims
The ominous implication was that Albanians, as non-Slavs, were not even capable of assimilation
While the Serbian state authorities repeatedly attempted to assimilate the Slavonic Muslims, they refrained from attempting to 'Serbianize' the Albanians
While both security concerns and the exclusive nationalist ideology influenced the government's policies, there was also some Serbian resistance to the 'cleansing' of the Albanians
General Jovan Belimarkovic opposed the deportation and offered his resignation to the government over this issue and journalist Manojlo Đjorđjević also condemned these policies and argued that Serbia should have pursued a policy of peaceful reconciliation towards the Albanians
In Toplica the Albanians were encountered, and we had nothing more important to do but to expel these warlike, but hard-working people from their homes
Instead of making a peace with them as the defeated side – they were without any good reason pushed across the border – so that they'll settle on the other side as the enemies of everything Serbian, to become the avengers towards those who pushed them from their homes
Despite some voices of dissent, the Serbian regime 'encouraged' about 71,000 Muslims, including 49,000 Albanians, 'to leave'. The regime then gradually settled Serbs and Montenegrins in these territories
Prior to 1878, the Serbs comprised not more than one half of the population of Nis, the largest city in the region; by 1884 the Serbian share rose to 80 per cent
According to Ottoman sources, Serbian forces also destroyed mosques in Leskovac, Prokuplje, and Vranje

"The 'cleansing' of Toplica and Kosanica would have long-term negative effects on Serbian-Albanian relations
The Albanians expelled from these regions moved over the new border to Kosovo, where the Ottoman authorities forced the Serb population out of the border region and settled the refugees there
Janjićije Popović, a Kosovo Serb community leader in the period prior to the Balkan Wars, noted that after the 1876–8 wars, the hatred of the Turks and Albanians towards the Serbs 'tripled'. A number of Albanian refugees from Toplica region, radicalized by their experience, engaged in retaliatory violence against the Serbian minority in Kosovo
In 1900 Živojin Perić, a Belgrade Professor of Law, noted that in retrospect, 'this unbearable situation probably would not have occurred had the Serbian government allowed Albanians to stay in Serbia'. He also argued that conciliatory treatment towards Albanians in Serbia could have helped the Serbian government to gain the sympathies of Albanians of the Ottoman Empire
Thus, while both humanitarian concerns and Serbian political interests would have dictated conciliation and moderation, the Serbian government, motivated by exclusive nationalist and anti-Muslim sentiments, chose expulsion
The 1878 cleansing was a turning point because it was the first gross and large-scale injustice committed by Serbian forces against the Albanians
From that point onward, both ethnic groups had recent experiences of massive victimization that could be used to justify 'revenge' attacks
Furthermore, Muslim Albanians had every reason to resist the incorporation into the Serbian state

"Кнез Милан се у то време налазио у Нишу, окружен својим официрима. Посебно је био близак са генералом Костом Протићем и у конзулским круговима у Београду се сматрало да је владар под његовим утицајем. Генерал Протић је током рата, а и после њега, био главни заговорник политике исељавања муслимана, па и Албанаца, из Србије. Његове ставове делио је и већи део виших официра српске војске. Кнез Милан је током рата био сагласан са протеривањем Албанаца. \[Prince Milan at that time was located in Niš, surrounded by his officers
He was especially close with General Kosta Protić and the consulate circles in Belgrade was thought to be the ruler under his influence
General Protić during the war, and after him, was the chief proponent of the policy of the eviction of Muslims, including Albanians, from Serbia
His attitude was shared by most of the senior officers of the Serbian army
Prince Milan during the war, was in conformity with the expulsion of Albanians

The first is misdirected, though possibly unavoidable
The second is just plain evil, and made the hatred between the two nations much much worse
Attacking Bulgaria in 1880s, our King did it to stop their unification, the morale was so shit he had to lie to his own men
Occupation and annexation of Montenegro after WW1
It's the most fucked up thing because it was a giant stab in the back against our closest ally organized by a power-hungry delusional centralistic monarchy ran by depraved men
Here's a giant fuck you to the Karađorđević and Obrenović dynasties and all of their enablers
Seriously, the greatest historical mistake of us Serbs is the fact that we did not depose the monarchy before the 20th century
P.S. The "honorable" mention is the completely insane 1912 occupation of Albania
It's not as fucked up in my opinion because it's not out of the ordinary for enemy nations to fuck up each other
You massacred Serbs as well
I mean, Montenegrins wanted to be unified, same as the Serbs, they just wanted Nikola to rule, which, objectively doesn't make sense sense he's a King of a nation of 200k while Serbia at the  time had around 5m.
What's pretty big tradition with us Serbs is "Slava" it's basically celebrating your family's patron saint this is inherited paternally mostly, this tradition started as ancient Slavic pagan tradition where Slavs celebrated their gods but when Serbs baptized in 9th century our old gods were replaced with christian saints and that is basically how an ancient Slavic pagan tradition that was probably a core tradition to pagan Serbs adapted to Christianity and still persists to this day
>The oldest son takes over his father's slava when he dies, but until then he doesn't have one even if he has his own family
Najstariji preuzima od oca jer ulgavnom on ostaje u njegovoj kuci da zivi (barem je pre tako bilo)
Ostali isto je slave ali u svojim kucama
> What if you're a younger son who married an only daughter, do you take your father in law's slava since nobody's there to inherit his
Nije potrebno da je jedinica, uvek u okviru porodice moze da se dogovori da se slavi i slava zene (znaci i jedna i druga, slava zene ne bi zamenila muzevu slavu)         Najjednosavnije : muzeva obavezna ; zenina opcionalna
Thank you and just know if any Serb ever invites you to his Slava know that he respects you, since we have a saying "na Slavu se ne poziva" which means you don't call people to Slava so if you are invited that means that you are a special and respected person
I'm sure Italians have a lot that the rest of us can only envy
We say smrt in Serbian too
(Wiem ze po polsku jest smierc
btw "wiem" czy "znam"? nie jestem pewna
It means you should not expect an invitation, but you are expected to come
Not that people can't come
It's actually common to invite a person once when you first meet them because they can't know when is your Slava
But from then on, it's excepted from them to remember
That's why you "don't call people to Slava". On Slavas there is always a lot of friends and family
Ako zive sa roditeljima otac slavi, oni je tek preuzimaju nakon sto se ozene i isele (osim onog sto zivi sa njima)
A kontam sada, e to zavisi od porodice jer ne mora nuzno da znaci da ce im otac dati slavu
Sada kada razmislim mislim da sam bio pogresio, slava se uglavnom uzima kada otac umre mada i ne mora
TL:DR Uglavnom 80%-90% Nije nista konstanto i moze da zavisi od dosta toga (obicaja iz tog dela srbije, porodice, sveca, pa i samog domacina
A serb that doesn't like ćevapi
A Serbian raw vegan who doesn’t drink

Living in Switzerland without a bank account is basically impossible
Yeah this works for Serbia just as well lmao
Works for a lot of other countries too
The Sun has neuter gender "to Sunce", while the Moon has masculine gender "taj Mesec". The Earth tho is feminine "ta Zemlja". I don't think there's much story to why is it so
In Serbian The Sun got middle (there are like 3 genders when saying male female and like object gender
) gender and the Moon got male gender
When the Nemanjic dynasty was in charge
We were basically in charge of the while Balkans, Bulgaria was the only other Balkan country which had even close to our power
Then when the last Nemanjic died, a few years later we started falling to the Ottomans
I'd say people admire Dušan the Mighty's kingdom the most as he created [Dušan's Code] with some pretty advanced law institutes, also he conquered many Byzantine cities and created autonomous Orthodox patriarchate so he could proclaim himself tsar
This is seen as both best period and himself as most important historical figure, but sadly he died young and unexpectedly so his son inherited him and ruined the kingdom and also earned the title of Uroš the Weak
Probably socialist Yugoslavia, we had good living standards, and were respected by the rest of the world
End of WW2 up to 70's - maybe early 80's in Yugoslavia
Definitely Golden Age for Serbia
Golden age of Serbia was during the rule of tsar Dušan the mighty (1331- 1355)
Serbia was then the largest and most powerful country in the Balkans, with out own law codex (Dušan's codex) and a patriarch
It did, however, disolve after his death
On second hand, my parents would say the years before the breakup of Yugoslavia were the best time to live in our history (from around 1975-1990)
The state took care of everything (education, industry, medical care), the country was large, rich and respected
The golden age of Serbia could be considered under Car Dušan's rule
Yeah but him dieing started it
18 years later the battle of Kosovo happened starting the Ottomans invasion
The reason Serbia lost there was because when the last Nemanjic died, Serbia was greatly weakened as now it was near impossible to unite all the knezes
The Nemanjic's were the only ones strong enough to unite them
Actually, they do
I was shocked when I went to work for one italian company there
Working hours were 6-16 and there were no state control neither labor inspection
I think Romania owns a lot of today's prosperity to that type of exploitation of workers past two decades

So, useful to know
>The Balkans get upset over things that from my perspective are just stupid
I could say similar things about Western Europe
Brexit comes to mind and the amount of misinformation and foolishness that came out of it
If you're seriously calling the name dispute a 'crisis' it's clear that you're another westerner who doesn't know shit about the place they're talking about
I think Vucic (current Serbian president) is up there, but probably Milosevic (he probably isn't most hated, but most controversial for sure)
There's no collaborative hate for one person, people like Tito are contraversial
Meaning most don't care, some like him (boomers) and some don't. Even Nazi collaborator Milan Nedić is contraversial because yes he helped the Germans exterminate Serbias Jews but then again he saved and sheltered Serbs from the NDH and Nazies
Why is Vucic hated
It doesn’t matter if he did shelter Serbs
He still killed innocent civilians and that should not be forgiven just because he sheltered Serbs
The people he had killed were Serb too
He's contraversial there's no unified opinion
Happy cake day
You cannot sound like a native
I'd say impossible if you're not a native speaker of a Slavic language
Hard
I think grammar is a bit complicated for foreigners because there are 7 cases you need to learn, and every things has its "gender" so to say which you have to really master if you want to be indistinguishable from native speakers
If you learn that, I think the rest of  the grammar is easy
Pronunciation is manageable if you learn the sounds of characters because we have a phonetic system
Now accent is pretty hard for non-native speakers
They manage to master consonants to some level, but the vowels are the problem I think
They tend to stretch them out a lot and sometimes add some extra sound to them
So 2 alphabets, 7 cases, 14 tenses, 4 accents, and some leftover grammar from proto-slavic aside
Really hard I would say
Almost impossible
Yes you can speak fine Serbian, but we will always know you're not from here
It's because even our institution for regulation of the language (Matica srpska) has difficulties defying rules for conjugations
For example, I've seen officially 7 conjugation groups (like ar er and ir in Spanish) while one of them has 2 subgroups
And all of them have a lot of exceptions
That just goes for conjugations
Foreigners can also easily mix up dž and đ, and č and ć.
As a native Slavic speaker I still make strange mistakes when speaking czech: I use naj- instead of nej-, I add "je" to 3rd person singular and "jsou" to 3rd person plural in past tense, I say "jezyk" instead of "jazyk"...
So grammar can be quite complicated to grasp
>4 genders
I wouldn't count masculin animate and masculin inanimate as two different genders tho
Like, yeah, some things are different, but it's still masculine gender, no
I would use seljaci instead of seljani, but we get the point
Not even then
You can tell the region where someone is in based on accent
And not to say ekavica/ijekavica speakers trying to speak the other one: adding j or removing it when it shouldn't be done and so on
Yes, if the pay is the same as working 5 days a week
I would like to thank France for helping Serbia during the WW1, Albania for letting our Army cross their country and Greece for welcoming them on the island of Corfu
I would like to thank Russia for supporting us throughout the years and Romania for being the only country that we didn't fight against
Thank you Poland for giving me my granny, pierogi, sernik and kisiel
Russia for helping save our ass in WW1, and for trying to help us in '99
Also Greece for harbouring nearly all our troops on Corfu in WW1 and for refusing to participate in '99
Greec for not bombing us in 1999, and of course i want to thank every country that does not recognize kosovo
We love you too and thank you for harbouring basically the entire Serbian Army and a substantial amount of civilians during the WW1 on the island of Corfu and other places around Greece
Also supporting us during 1999 bombardment and refusal to participate in it
We can understand other South Slavic languages like Bulgarian/Macedonian and Slovenian with some effort but it's easier for some (northern Croatians understand Slovenian much better than south Serbs who understand Macedonian and Bulgarian better)
We can get the gist of Slovaks and Czechs if they speak slower and Polish is a bit harder for me personally
Russian/Belorussian/Ukranian is the hardest, I understand very little when conversing with a speaker mostly I understand a few words here and there
>spoken polish is complete gibberish for me
Yes
For me Polish sounds like a German trying to speak Russian while having a stroke
They are simply dialects of one language, like US and UK english
Bularian and N. Macedonian are very close, Slovenian is a bit harder to understand farher south you go
Same here, feel like we have more similar words

Belgrade
don't get me wrong, the city is nice and all if all that you look for is spending money and clubbing, but except for that, there is nothing special about it
overly hyped tourist trap imo
I meannnn
do I actually need to write anything here
Croatia most probably, I think they feel the same way
Historically, Bulgaria for sure
Nowadays Croatia
Croatia most likely
Croatia, Bosnia, Albania
Croatia and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Croatia by far
Presmesno mi sto se svi posvadjase
Ye, I hope we make this tensions into an rivalry banter in the future, we don't need to fight, especially since we have to work out our economies, industries and politics
Yes it pretty much is
Romania is our best neighbour politically
We were always allies (WW2 is an exception) and they are one of the rare EU and NATO countries that don't recognize triggerland
And Romania
We're pretty good with Romania
Montenegro is a bit contraversal seeing that theres a literal civil war going on with The Montenegrin gov and 30% of the population wants to steal our churches and riches,while the other 70% is in full revolt for 5 months straight
Yeah, I think the same
Albania is too inferior to Serbia to even speak about it
(in terms of economy)
Nah a rival has to be on the same level as you
Of course
Greece is our biggest ally along with Russia, but I was talking about neighbours (countries we share a border with), my gyros brother
Felt it in Serbia, I hope that there are no casualties and that everyone is okay
Stay strong
Drz'te se, hrvati

I didn't feel anything, for reference I'm from Vojvodina (Novi Sad specifically) which borders Croatia
I'm in Novi Sad Serbia, my boyfriend felt it a bit (he thought he was falling off the bed), I didn't feel a thing and slept through, though I slept through when the city brigdges were being destroyed by bombarding '99 too, so that doesn't mean I lot
I too hope everyone is okay in Cro, stay strong and stay safe

I like it here in Serbia, I know a lot of people are moaning about our country being underdeveloped, but in my opinion I think that in the past 5 years, we've come far
I like it but I'd like to experience living in another country aswell
Yeah yeah i love it here in Serbia high wages normal people, cheap prices
Of course not in lying i'd rather move to usa than live here
Well, a lot of our historians and politicians said: "we have the best position for peace, and worst for war", and sadly that theory has been proven many times during the history
Geographically and economically speaking, Serbia's position is best possible, but when it comes to war, that can be a huge problem
It was more popular some 20-30 years ago, now it's somewhat a rare sight
Niva still holds on, though, especially in rural environments

A foreigner in /r/serbia asked how to separate trash while in Serbia
They got [this answer]
I gave my friend some rakija to take home
She went for her wallet to pay for it
DO YOU HATE ME THAT MUCH
Lmao separating trash in Serbia
so he showed up before you told him to come
so he showed up before you told him to come
when do you have dinner then
Good try, but no
You are not my long lost friend
You might be my future friend
And yes, you can have some rakija for free
Just you have to share first glass with me
Rakija is drank slowly and with enjoyment

Realistically speaking Putin still does karate, plays hockey and was a KGB agent so likely him
Orban seems pretty tough but sadly he's quite short
Either Putin or Vučić (Serbian president) because he is like 2m tall
Boyko Borisov for sure
Just because someone us overweight doesn't mean they're not strong
True but his martial arts evens it out
Or I'm just informed about it and curious, stop making it be a media thing
Oh you just can't imagine the cult of putin made by pro-government media here
I learned he plays hockey from an Oliver Stone interview which is amercian media that I found online and I know he's a KGB agent and does karate from Wikipedia, also online

Hard to say
I'm a Hungarian minority born in Serbia, and my parents, grand parents and great grand parents were also all born here
Yet, somehow, occasionally I don't feel *"Hungarian-enough"* as someone actually born and raised back in Hungary
At the same time, I'm also clearly not a Serbian by blood and I don't exactly feel like a part of their club either (not all the way, anyway)
So, while nobody discriminates me, I feel caught in the middle in a sorta *"neither here, nor there"* situation - on a personal note, also not helped by the fact that I have a half sibling from a parent's previous marriage (to a Serbian) who has a Serbian name and surname and identifies as such despite of his mixed parentage, who really isn't the closest with us and mainly hangs out with other Serbians and while I respect his choice, it also makes me feel even more internally alienated and adds to the weight of the impression that something I can't quite point my finger at is amiss in this whole story
I hate people here because a lot of them are delusional, but I couldn't be anything really if I wasn't Orthodox
We are drinking nation, we just drink without thinking about it
Basically everybody in the country gets drunk about once a month
But not on beer and all that shit
We drink real drinks, wine, ракија, whiskey, etc,
Never saw one
One of the funniest things I saw, related to US based evangelical Christians, was when few of them came to Serbia with idea to preach to the people
On the streest
In English
In the town where Constantin the Great (also known as the first Christian emperor) was born
Most of the people laughed their asses off
One time even paramedics were called because people thought that wannabe preacher had some sort of seizure or that he escaped from mental institution
I have never seen one in Serbia
Most of billboards are filled with commercials or political party advertisement
Macedonian/Bulgarian and Slovenian
After that all the other Slavic languages barring Polish maybe
Macedonian, Bulgarian and Slovak
Czech is, in comparison to Slovak a bit more complex to understand
Russian and Macedonian because it's really similar
I don't count Croatian, Bosniak or Montenegrin because we share the similar language base
You can understand some Bulgarian, Russian, Ukrainian, Macedonian and probably Czech
But Russian, Bulgarian and Ukrainian when they talk a little slower
Well Bosnian and Croatian if you are counting those as seperate languages
If you aren't, then Macedonian, Bulgarian or Russian
Can relate

In Serbia it's probably [Pljeskavica]
I'd say most people don't have one, but it's not odd if you do own one
One of the perhaps unusual practices that's common in the Balkans is waving your flag on a wedding day, I'd say that's the most common reason people would own one
No, why would that be strange
it's odd if you don't have one
It’s not odd, but when someone has a serbian flag at home and it’s not for a wedding, then people would assume he is a serbian nationalist etc, right-winger
What
I'm not sure I know one person who has a flag
I'd say it's rather rare seeing it if it's not an official building
I don't recall ever seeing a flag on a private house or window in the city where I live in (Novi Sad)
It's sad because I actually really love our flag but don't want to be associated with those fucks
It might be a little exaggerated, but I know a bunch of people that have one, including me (Sremska Mitrovica)
To be fair, Americans also put them on their homes and local businesses, I'll never get used to that
I agree
Hehe pretpostavljam da je istina negde na sredini, ali što se ovog drugog tiče stvarno ne mogu da se setim da sam ikad videla u Novom Sadu zastavu istaknutu na nečijoj kući ili na terasi
It's [*Hawkeye*] probably
It was taken in 1914 and depicts Dragutin Matić, a Serbian scout, during the Battle of Drina
The photo pretty much symbolizes WWI in Serbia, especially the [*Great Retreat*] even though it was taken a year earlier
How did you have photographers in 1860s when your country has been made in 21st century
I'd be greatly disappointed to find out that pic wasn't taken in Croatia

We had a war 22 years ago, and another one 4 years before that
>We profited off helping the NATO campaign in Serbia for a fast track to the EU and NATO, supported by the British
I don't say this proudly at all, but it's what happened, and it happened during my lifetime too
I've met people with VERY strong opinions about that
What is the general opinion about the 1999 bombing in Romania
Where exactly are these ideas of restoring our empires are coming from
What news do they serve you in Ukraine about Serbs
Do you really think we're waging war
Cause Serbia has good relations with all of its neighbours
Would you consider Russia a threat to Finland
Serbia lost 60% of its male population and about 30% overall, it was quite devastating
Sorry to inform you that your opinion couldn't be further from the actual truth
We had enough wars for no reason already
No one here is willing to lay their lives for such  idea
Nor we are thinking about it or care for that matter
Whatever you heard, or you think you've heard is pretty much wrong
And fuck modern Russia
Many of us actually do not like it at all
There are strong historical ties, that is true, but that doesn't mean that we actually support what  they are doing nor that we are preparing to go to war
That is just insane
An interesting perspective, thanks
Yes, we use "jutro" for area measurment of arable land
To compare: 1ha = 1,75 jutro
In Serbia, we have two official alphabets: cyrillic (traditional) and latin
I used to think writing in latin alphabet was "cool", but now i prefer cyrillic and think it's so wonderful and unique that we can expres our language in 2 alphabet
I did not really like our Epic Poetry when i was younger but only recently i realized how beautiful, poetic and badass it is
But .. but how can it be a type of soup
It's like saying beans are a type of soup, at least it feels that way to me :)
Danish is super difficult, but also kind of likable in a way, from my persepective
In the Balkans one must make a distinction between folk music (which is generally often region-specific and often a real cultural heritage) and modern folk-pop nonsense that is a cheap copy with drum machines, synthesizers and autotune,
it's called [digraphia] To me it is second nature
i also realized it is kinda cool later in life that I can switch alphabets with no effort
The body of works of Serbian epic poetry is massive too:
There are literally thousands of poems with hundreds of verses that used to be sung from memory accompanied by traditional instruments describing historical events, battles, kings and heroes
I am not even an ethnic Serb, but I must say it is a priceless cultural treasure
Actual poems of heroism and adventure of poetry considered by Grimm brothers as one of the most beautiful in all of Europe
Eastern Roman Empire
Ottoman Empire
Austria (Austro-Hungary)
Montenegro
Russia
Yugoslavia too but I don't know if it counts
Honourable mention of France
Turkey (Ottoman Empire)
Austria - Hungary (both equally)
Bulgaria
Greece (Byzantium)
Russia (Russian Empire and later on communists)
Honorable mentions to all EX Yugoslav countries, especially Croatia (although we didn't have much shared history before 20th century)
Eastern Roman empire
Ottoman empire
Bulgaria
Hungary
Austria
That's why it's an honourable mention
I was mostly referring to the fact that France was a big inspiration in Serbia when it came to organising our society and especially the laws post Ottoman occupation
Same with Serbia to an extent
>"give me 100000 croats and I'll conquer the world"
We have a similar saying that Napoleon talked highly about Karadjordje who was the leader of the First Serbian uprising against the Ottomans
France throughout history up until relatively recently was a big ally of Serbia and in WW1 they even saved our troops in Albania and transported them to Greece
It would all either be occupied by Russia, Germany, or the US
If it is Russia their might be one or two independent countries,  others none

Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro
Sadly, we are Europe's most disfunctional family
In Serbia we call many our brothers
Russia- as orthodox, Slavic nation as us and as an ally
Montenegro- although politicians try to divide us, in heart and soul we are the same
And Greece- as a brother country with who we fought against the Turks, Bulgarians, Austrians and Germans
Also, only NATO country that didn't bombard us in 1999
Russia as a fellow Slavic country, probably the closest one through that
Montenegro since we are nearly the same people but the politicians (cough cough Đukanović) try to divide us
Greece because we are both strongly orthodox countries and they are the only NATO country which didn't bomb us in '99
I also think Russia as we are allies and Slavic
Also Greece because of religion
Serbia is also probably close because of religion and you were the only NATO country that didn't bomb us in '99
>Most Albanians would say Croatia since we’ve had a similar history
Of having constant war with Serbia
how can it be kosovo when kosovo is serbia
Our countrie's history is wierd, we are either trying to wipe the other off the face of the Earth, or being friends
We already had 2
Yeah, other slavs too
But these 3 are closest family we have
Our feelings for Croatia are, lets say mixed
Shadow of war still stands over us and many didn't forget it
Unlike these three, Croatia generally isn't seen as a brother country

Where the father in-law puts an apple on the highest tree in the bride’s yard, where the groom then has to then shoot it
The bride is unable to leave the house until the apple gets shot
Drinking from the flask:
Before the wedding day, the Buklijas, a young man from the groom’s side, will invite guests over to drink from “the special flask”. This flask is called the Buklija
These guests will then drink from the flask and decorate it with money
Boy or girl:
Before the wedding ceremony, the bride will drink from a glass, toast, and then throw the glass
If the glass breaks, it is said that she will birth a boy
However, if the glass stays intact, a girl will be birthed
The one and only bride:
Brides are absolutely not allowed to see other brides on their wedding day
So, if you are sharing a big venue space with another wedding, you will want to be sure that the bride is covered when out and about
It’s believed that the bride that is seen will get married, but will also die
Hiding garlic in your bosom:
In a Serbian wedding, the bride fights bad luck by hiding garlic in her bosom
So, be sure to discover a lovely perfume to adorn yourself with, as you wouldn’t want to emit the aroma of garlic on your big day
Diverting evil eyes:
Once again, you can fight evil on your wedding day by featuring a Zarac
The Zarac will be dressed in a wreath of peppers and hold a whip that will divert evil eyes from the happy couple
Leading the way:
When it comes to a Serbian wedding processional, the Barjaktar will lead the way for the wedding party by featuring a banner with an apple on top of it, along with being adorned in towels, rosemary, and flowers
Protected with a mirror:
For even more protection, the bride should carry a small mirror to frighten demons with their own reflection
Hiding beauty:
In Serbia, the veil is more than an accessory, as it will hide the bride from evil spirits, as well as her beauty from other men
No Pearls:
A bride can adorn herself with many beautiful jewels on her big day, but never pearls, as they symbolize tears
So, opt for diamonds, rubies, sapphires; just no pearls
Bridal Wreath:
From necklaces to bracelets, the bride has an array of lovely details to choose from for her bridal beauty
However, she must wear a bridal wreath
The bridal wreath allows the bride to stand out, protects her from evil entities, and also symbolizes fertility
Buying of the Bride:
A very unique Serbian wedding custom is the “Buying of the Bride”, where the bride is sold by her own brother, and bought by the groom
Serbian Cinderella:
During the “Buying the Bride” custom, the groom’s brother will put money in the bride’s shoe and spin in it three times
Who Will Run the House:
During the wedding ceremony, as the couple says their vows, the bride has the option to step on the groom’s foot if she pleases
By doing so, it means that she will supposedly be in charge, and run the house
The Pulling of the Nose:
Once the wedding reception begins, the bride will ask all of the single ladies “Do you want me to pull your nose
”. It is believed that the one that the bride pulls by the nose will be the next to get married
An Apple for the Men:
Instead of the tossing of the garter, the groom will cast an apple that has coins embedded in it over the bride’s head to all of the single gentlemen
And, whoever catches it should be the next to get married

Unlesse groom is bad at shooting, becuse first few shot every one is hypped then with each miss it get more silent and boring, and when its silent and boring it becomes aqwured
Yeah we also have bouquet throwing ofc
Ty man, in serbian you dont have spelling like in english or franch (one leather one sound, no "silent" leathers in words, imagine if all words you pronounce like hit)
Cyrillic |Latin | pronunciation
&#x200B;
Ђ ђ |Đ đ  |like Ј in jukebox (little softer)
Ж ж | Ž ž |like SU in Pleasure (like JE in je m'appelle)
Љ љ | LJ lJ |Not similar to anything (Say L (like in word Let) followed fast by  J ( and thats pronaunced like Y in You)
Њ њ  | NJ nj | Like NE in New
Ћ ћ | Ć ć | Soft CH sound
Ч ч  | Č č | like CH in chair
Џ џ | Č č |Like J in just
Ш ш  | Š š | like SH in shock
&#x200B;
And here is just funny laters  Д д (D),  Л л (L),  Ф ф (F),  П п (P),  Ц ц (C), Г г  (G)
I am stuudying right now, in 1h when I get on pc I will show you all "funny" lethers and how you pronaunce them
We have few of thouse č = ch
Cyrilic and latin are bought accepted (guverment papers need to be in cyrilic)
And schoole books are also in cyrilic
Bring back [this one] (Pre WW1)
Idk why it reminds me of mint, and I LOVE mint flavored everything, so it's a great flag
10/10
Because red white and blue are considered "Pan-Slavic" colors agreed in Prague Slavic Congress, based on Russian flag
Honestly I think it's a great idea to have all Slavic people have one similar thing just so we remember that we were once same people
Red white and blue are great example of "unity" between us all, that's not as obvious
However if some countries would like to change a color of their flag, I'd consider another Slavic Congress to discuss some other way to represent symbolism of Slavic roots (tho I don't think it's ever going to happen)
*Some countries did not choose these colors (Poland, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Belarus and Ukraine)
Actually Russian flag was inspired by Netherlands' back then :)
That sounds insane to me, a relationship between family shouldn't be that between a landlord and the one inhabiting the house
That said if you have a job it's generally expected for you to pitch in, but I seriously doubt you'd get kicked out if you didn't.
Harsh, Rough, Precise and Direct, so yeah kinda like German of Balkan languages all other ex-yu and Balkan languages are noticeably softer
I first saw Basque as a written text, and when I searched on youtube and actually heard the language it sounded completly different than I expected
As you said it sounded so much like Spanish
Yeah that's why i love when Croatian girls speak
Yeah although Serbian has a lot more consonants
My god, I thought you guys were messing around until I used Google translate
Google translate says: Shred the unleaved (leafless
) reeds, bristle the crosspiece with a worshiper
I mean, it doesn't make that much sense, but I thought, who knows, maybe it's an old Polish saying or something
But it does recognize the actual words
Interesting, thanks for the clear up
That makes sense, thanks
Thank you Greece for everything you did for Serbs in WW1
Thank you for respecting and remembering our common history and maintaining the friendship

Id like to thank Montenegro for being such a bro
Thank you for being good neighbours, too
And thank you for the respect and comemoration of our victims from the Arad Fortress in WW1
This is something I've found out only recently
Lots of love for Greece
Bulgarians don't hate Serbia for like more than 100 years
They are actually really friendly towards Serbs probably because we speak very similar language
Not going to hate on people I consider brothers just because some organisation doesn't like you
Why are we frenemies
Yall fought each other in Balkan War 2
And we will never forget your captain refusing to go on a bombing mission towards Serbia and Montenegro (he got a medal for that recently) or Greeks generally causing havoc in NATO by sending relief to areas they knew would be targeted thus saving lives by diverting NATO planes from bombing
It goes deeper than Russia invading Ukraine
I've seen people on various subreddits that are straight russophobic to Russians
>Nobody would be russophob, if you just stop invading neighboring countries and using your natural resources as a political tool to subjugate other countries
Do as we say,not as we do lol
Wow, that's nice
What's funny
Is it really that hard to believe not everyone is hateful like Albanians
I'm sure you have never been in Bulgaria
Eh that really isn't a frenemy
A frenemy would be like us and Bulgaria in Balkan War 1
We weren't really friendly but we had a common enemy
Serbs and Romanians are generally very friendly so i don't see us as frenemies
Russian invasion of Ukraine is the result of NATO completely surrounding it I think that's pretty obvious
>assholes
If you use this term to refer to Russia it can be used for literally any country in history
Wasn't Poland also an asshole when they burned down Moscow
Because that's how they are taught
There is not a single neighbour they don't hate
Not a single one
Serbia, Greece, North Macedonia and Montenegro
>except Hungary our brothers
Magyarisation, WW2 occupation and raids on us wasn't very nice to be honest
What are you talking about they tried joining and were turned down
I live in Belgrade and I keep the doors of my apartment locked
Two reasons - I really do not want to have any uninvited guests and second, my car could get out
EDIT: you guys made me chuckle
God damn autocorrect
Personally I leave my door unlocked during day, but locked when everyone go to sleep
However this is not a general truth and I can't really say anything
Everyone do as they wish I guess
You must have a pretty roomy apartment
In Belgrade as well and its the same for me
I hate our culture of stepping into peoples homes uninvited
Wait, we have this culture
I've lived in Belgrade all my life and have never heard of this happening
It is more common in rural areas, plus it depends on your neighborhood, but I know many people who are just fine with it
Serbian Latin: Džon mejd hiz vej to a tavern tru d dark forest, onli tu fajnd aut dat hi forgot d mani
Serbian Cyrillic:
Џон мејд хиз веј ту а таверн тру д дарк форест, онли ту фајнд аут дат хи форгот д мани.
Dzon mejd his vej tu a tavern tru de dark forest, onli to fajnd aut det hi forgot de mani
It would look like this:
"Džon mejd hiz vej tu a tevrn tru d dark forest, onli tu fajnd aut det hi forgot d mani"
Џон мејд хиз веј ту а таверн тру д дарк форест, онли ту фајнд аут дат хи форгот д мани.
Also [relevant scene] from a Serbian movie Tesna Koža, oh and [another one]
Како би ова Енглеска реченица изгледала кад би била написана у писму твоје државе?
Roughly that
Cyrillic:
Џон мејд хиз веј ту а теврн тру д дарк форест, онли ту фајнд аут дат хе форгот д мани.
Latin:
Džon mejd hiz vej tu a tevrn tru d dark forest, onli tu fajnd aut dat he forgot d mani
What the fuck
Yeah it's troublesome for a lot of people learning English
Aj dount nou abaut ju gajz, bat dis iz mejking mi laf sou hard
Mi tu*
Its okej, šit hepens
It's called Megatrend University, it's so good, not too expensive, professors are really into their jobs, few years ago they made 2 new branches, one for pilots, idk how that's going, but one for the DJs is really good, so yeah
None
Serbia is kicked out of ENQA im 2019
It’s so sad
To bre
Oh common, Bratislava is the cosiest city ever
Aww that's a shame :(
Make sure to use the next possible opportunity, you won't be disappointed
Not really answering your question but kinda similar:
To say "I don't care
", we say "baš me briga
" which actually means "I really care
" (It's always used sarcastically)
It's a way of life here
From lovest to highest levels
I think we are among top ten countries in the world regarding the corruption
Think Russian model od curruption but on a scale that it's public and nobody even denies it
Our government is so incompetent they can't even do corruption right
Unfortunately if you don't want to wait in the hospital, bring chocolate, coffee, drinks or even money to nurse or maintenance stuff and just like that you are almost 1st in line
Obviously this isn't just for hospitals, but it was an example
When it comes to politics, we are very corrupted
Here it's a part of life, it's a branch of government
Sombody said we need a ministry *for* corruption
I can't tell you how corrupt is my country, because you didn't ask that question on the LBOŠ form, and you need to add your birth certificate and citizenship along M24 form
However, if you help me out with some fat envelope, which I'm in need, I may be able to answer that question on Tuesday
Extremely
Everything is corrupt
You can buy off a police officer for as low as 20€.
You need to pay doctors to get treatment
Laws are not followed nor enforced
Same here in Serbia
Do you think anything might change for the better with your new president
Happy cake day
[Bora Dugić - Tren (Moment)]
[Bora Dugić - Običan balkanski dan (Regular Balkans day)] this one perfectly captures the dynamics of an everyday life in the Balkans and incorporates various Balkan sounds into one
[Sanja Ilić & Balkanika - Simonida] A song that kinda captures the tragedy of the Serbian people during the Ottoman occupation
The song is about an icon of Queen Simonida, daughter of Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and wife of King Stefan Uroš II Milutin
Her icon was damaged by the Turks by scratching out the eyes, a typical method of icon defacing
Wow, I actually understood most of it
And what about ["A ty myla"] and "[Gei sokoly] those are among my favorite ukrainian songs
Are these are not classics in the Ukraine
Good one
From Bulgarian songs I prefer [Moma se s roda proshtava] but this one is also great
Can you give alternative link
This one doesn't work
So I live in Belgrade (1
3 milion)
The city has nice parts , but I wouldn't call it pretty
Grimey and rough around the edges , but with character is how I would describe it ( being destroyed and rebuilt 40 times does that to you)
Pros :
- Nightlife is great , most places work until the early morning , and the atmosphere in clubs and partys is great
- Food is also good , while the variety isn't really there , traditional Serbian restaurants are amazing
-Bunch of roads next to the rivers (Sava and Danube) where you can walk, ride your bike
etc
- A lot of cafés , if you're into that stuff
Cons :
- The city desperately needs a metro system
The roads that were built through the city weren't built for so many cars , so the existing public transportation system isn't effective enough
- There isn't really a bunch of nice places in nature around Belgrade
- The wages and costs of housing are not proportional
The average wage is around 350€ , and a decent , nothing special 1
5 room apartment rent will cost around  250-300€.
Miloš, Mihajlo, Aleksandar, Milan, Petar
Pretty common names today aswell
Stefan, Uroš, Dušan, Vukan, Nemanja, Milutin, Dragutin, Đorđe, Aleksandar, Petar, Mihajlo, Milan, Miloš.
Arguably also Danilo, Nikola and Petar again
(altho Njegoš is also a name nowdays)
Men: Caslav, Ratomir, Vlastimir, Prosigoj, Viseslav, Konstantin, Mihajlo, Vukan, Zavida, Nemanja, Rastko, Stefan, Vladislav, Radislav, Radoslav, Uros, Milutin, Dragutin, Dusan, Petar, Aleksandar, Milan i probably missed some
Female: Jelena, Milica, Ana, Ljubica, Olivera some other definitely just can't think of them
Nothing strange about most of these names are common except a few like Zavida, Prosigoj that stand out a bit
Nemanja, Stefan, Dushan, Urosh, Lazar, Alexander, Petar, Mihailo, Milosh, Nikola, those are the first that came to mind
As for girls:
Milica, Natalija, Zorka, Jerina, I don't know anymore now
Yeah, we had a long monarchist tradition until the red plague came
Clodomir
That sound Slavic as fuck, does anybody know etymologi of this name since France isn't really close to Slavic lands
Omurtag is raw big dick energy name
Đorđe too
And that's only modern times, not to mebtion Nemanjić dynasty, or pre-Christian rulers
Also, disputedly, Petrocić-Njegoš dynasty
>Yeah, we had a long monarchist tradition
Yeah, all 150 years of it
And befor you say, no, there is no continuity between Nemanjić dynasty and modern ones
What about the Russian monarchs, would sound foreign but some more than others
How much is Alexander a foreign name or Catherine
I mostly went for the modern Kings
So we have no ties with the Nemanjic state
We are a completely different Serbia than they were
Okay
Ulrich sound badass to be honest
A kdo byl Jiří?
We don't have continuum with medieval Serbian state (or rather states)
That doesn't meab we have no ties with medieval or pre-chriatian serbs
Just as britiah monarchic trafition starts in 1066, so does ours start in, well, 1833 (I think thats the year), wehn Miloš Obrenović became knjaz of Serbia, and the title was hereditary
I respect that
I just think that there is no reason we shouldn't be proud about medieval Serb states
That's why I think we have a continuum, we as a people have just formed various states throughout history
Ofc we should
I never sad we shouldn't be proud of who we are
And yes, the sates were formed by the same people
Modern serbian state is the product of serbian revolution of 18th century and victories in WWI and WWII
I just think we shoulf ideologicly distinguish between medieval states based in fudalism and modern states based on modern ideas
We were the second state in Europe to abolish feudalism btw:))
Just goes to show how progressive we were back then (tho Miloš had that moment "eithsr me or the constitution
Absolute monarchy or nothing")
Well he was an intelligent ruler, gotta give him credit for that
Credit where credit's due
Dora teaches Spanish in Serbia if I remember correctly
Which is kinda weird because Spanish is not a popular language for studying here, it'd be better if they changed it to English instead
It is indeed weird - English would be much better
The thing is we don't really change much when it comes to TV shows/movies
All the movies and TV Shows are original with subtitles (which I love, btw - I don't want some random lame voice actors to ruin an amazing show for me - this way you can still get some jokes that would be lost in translation otherwise)
Only kids' movies and cartoons are dubbed
I've tried both, super bock is slightly better, but the best beer I had in Portugal was Coruja
Nonono, not if you toast it
When ot melts, it drains DOWN
This is an important question and it deserves some data collection
Just because we are a third world country does not mean that we are poor, but that we did not choose a side in the Cold War
I got reminded and instantly got suicidal thoughts
I can't even explain hov aids the todays mainstream music scene in Serbia is
Its basically infinite 69 copycats or wanabees,and their demographic is mostly 10-15yo kids
Luda po tebe
Haide opa
And in Denmark the IDs have no picture
To be fair it serves as you healthcare card and other things but basically it's the only thing you have
Yeah, I lived in CPH only
Merak (turkish origin)
A state of mind where everything is just right
You go to a local pub to drink beer with friends, live music is playing for your table, you have nothing to worry about, you are happy that you are in that momeny with those people
It is merak for you
The name Siniša(Sinisha) Is the one I dislike the most
I'm not sure why but all annoying kids are named Siniša.
Siniša: little son
JUST NO
Names like Lav, Mia, Vanja (this one is unisex) are just repulsive to me
Same here, I know a Gypsy family who named their children Armando, Valentino, Izabel and Rolencija
In my entire life I have never heard of anyone else worldwide being named Rolencija, or Rolencia
Don't forget Sandokan and Kasandra
Oh, definitely
Met quite a few Kasandras, haha
Wirelles power transfer, earthquake machine, electric supersonic plane, Ray of death
Yeah, Tesla was a prototype of mad scientist
Sorry to bust your bubble but neither of those are Croatian inventions
Dactyloscopy - mid 19th century, first used by Sir William James Herschel in India
Torpedo - 1866 by British engineer Robert Whitehead (albeit it was done in Rijeka)
Parachute - late 18th century by Louis-Sébastien Lenormand in France
Thermos or vacuum flask - 1892 by Scottish scientist Sir James Dewar
Not sure if it counts as an invention, but what [this guy did]
It isn't? I really thought everybody has one
That would be nice and I think everyone wants it, but it is much more complex
Airplane network is Scale free network (  while railway network is Random network, which means it is easy to add (or remove) one airplane from Budapest to Barcelona in almost any time, while that is almost not possible with trains
Trains require much more stable routes and traffic, which would probably happen if it was connected system, but still
Top eleven: football manager
Scorn, it's supposed to be published soon
Underrail
Hellion
Genesis rising: the universal crusade
Call of heroes: pompolic wars
There's this up and coming game that's getting a lot of traction, called Scorn
A first person survival horor game that I see quite a few YouTubers covering
Pathfinder Kingmaker was also made by a russian studio i think
I think it quickly acquired a cult, If not giant, following
I was obsessed with the show even if I was confused most of the time
Same
yeah
you're welcome
Ditto <3
N. Macedonia, Montenegro
rebellion
What happened in 1918
paying that money to drive for like an hour  is not worth it
Next, nectar and swisslion are very popular I would say
From energy drinks booster and definitely Guarana, it's really amazing drink
Cedevita rocks, but I've never tried Pipi, don't think we have it in stores
Could you explain what it is
Oh great, I'll have to try it
Thanks
English because the translations suck
I don't really have a choice, I haven't played any game that's translated into Serbian or Croatian, but even it was, I'd play on English, I guess I'm just used to it in video games
It's never avalible, so i just play in English
If games that have no voice acting I'd try in Serbian
Sadly that doesn't exist but I prefer English anyways
English becouse translations to Serbian are aids 99% of the time
Kudos to AoC2 for an actual good translation
If there is good translation yes
English all the way(with subtitles)
Synchronization is a work of the devil
They are mostly old (40-80yrs old)
They are either ultra chads or Vucic's sandwich-eaters, there's nothing in between
Hahah, yeah I might have exeggarated it, but what I meant was there's no young people there
Some factory probably exploded badly when got hit with depleted uranium
I think [that this] is at about the same level as that one
And some Japanese cult tested a nuke in the outback
To Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia
Sorry for being jerks and idiots
We had a great thing together and we didn't know how to appreciate it until it was gone
To Montenegro and Macedonia, yes we accept your independence and we don't want to force you into some grand union ever again
We've learned our lesson
To Kosovo, most of us have made peace with your independence, and we don't hate you
We just ask that you have understanding about the worry regarding the monasteries
In Serbia we envy you a bit
You've had such a hard time in WWII and after that with the soviets yet still you've manged to build great economy and some really cool skyscrapers
We've had it easier after WW and yet only thing we were able to do was to fuck up a country that if remained whole, today could rival some of the richest EU countries
I think that is just a human way
I sure do love me some milk
I've been a drinker my whole life, but now I'm losing my tolerance :( If I could I'd drink milk all the time
with that many non European origin people I really doubt you're even in top 10, let alone highest
We use
Bogu iza nogu or Bogu iza Leđa, meaning behind God's legs or behind God's back
Also Nedođija, meaning Neverland, likely not having anything to do with Neverland from Peter Pan
In Serbian we have "Vukojebina" = place where wolves fck
To all health workers in Europe and around the world, thank you
You are the real heroes, and when this all is over, we will own you big times
It's ok to be affraid
I am affraid for myself and people I care about
Yet, despite all this, you all keep working, and for that we all are thankful for this
We are white/european, but that doesnt mean we colonized anyone or owned slaves or anything like it
Just throwing this out there
In Serbia some people call Italians "žabari" what means frog eaters
"Ko se nije sakrio, magarac je bio" - The one that didn't hide is a donkey
Spreman ili ne, dolazim
Spremni ili ne, krećem
Спремни или не, крећем!
,,Spreman ili ne, dolazim
We also say lopata for shovel
Da, na to misli, ni ja nisam odmah skapirala
Croats or Bosnians using our words would sound pretty weird
I wouldn't find it offensive I'd think they're just trying to make me understand
Serbian spoken in Serbia is Ekavian while the one spoken in Montenegro and Bosnia is Ijekavian
This means that words that had Old Slavic sound [yat] (ѣ, ě), are pronounced different (vreme - vrijeme, mleko - mlijeko, lep - lijep)
Other than that the are no major differences in vocabulary or grammar
I don't mind anyone speaking different dialect, but unfortunately I have witnessed a few times, in public transport, people telling Ijekavian speakers to go back where they came from
It is annoying when they don't sometimes, but not to bad usually
But there are some places who I can't even understand if they talk like they normally do
As long as we understand each other it's no problem
I don't think anyone minds
Ijekavian is spoken in Western Serbia too, and it's official just like ekavian
>For instance my friend was thrown out of a store in croatia because she used the serbian word for bread (unintentionally)
Jesus wth
For instance although this is more know
In Croatia and Bosnia they say grah for beans but we say pasulj or kruh for bread and here it's hleb
In Croatian they also say for instance časnik for officer (like a military one) but we say oficir
There's small differences that aren't noticeable like saying Europa for Europe in Croatia but we say Evropa with a 'v'.
That is true, but in practice Ekavian is taught in schools and all media is in Ekavian
While I have met older people from Western Serbia who speak Ijekavian, I must say that all of my college friends from that area (Prijepolje, Priboj, Užice) spoke Ekavian
Yeah the pasulj instead of grah thing is kind of a meme at this point everyone will know what you mean if you say either one
My Great-grandmother who's from Croatia always said grah and as a kid that confused the hell out of me I thought she was speaking a different language
Why is using grah strang
My parents and grandparents mostly used grah for pasulj, I thought it's normal in all Serbia
I have just noticed now when you have mentioned grah is used more rare lately
From mine experience it's usually Swedes who are secluded
Have you heard of Bosnia
We're definitely not, in fact we're very good friends
when you say people, it’s implying that all Serbian people support Slobodan Milosevic and politicians like him which is false
I for one do not support his actions that he had made during the 90s but for those who did support him and still do I will never understand
Because as you said he was primarily involved in many deaths in the 90s and was also responsible for not only the deaths of both Albanians and Serbians but was also responsible for kicking Albanians out of there homes in Kosovo which is completely wrong and should in no way be supported
The same however can be said about how some Croatians support or supported certain politicians that were heavily responsible for the deaths of many people and where many people were forced to leave their homes in the 90s. I am talking about Franjo Tudman and politicians like him
I don’t care what someone’s ethnicity is, I don’t care what someone’s religion is, if you’re responsible and capable of murdering innocent civilians in cold blood and leaving many families displaced without homes to go to, you are heartless, despicable, disgusting, low life of a human being if you can even call them a human being
And those people who support politicians like that are sick and are as despicable as those politicians
3 presidents they each take turns who's gonna be president of the presidency, 3 constituent peoples of which 2 want to separate and everyone wants something different for the country so serious decision making is impossible
I’m pretty sure the mostly the old also support Milosevic as well
Could you please elaborate on how Franjo did good
I’m curious to know what Serbian politicians you believe are worthy of being supported
It can be past or present
Most if not all Yugoslav politicians made terrible decisions which doomed the whole of Yugoslavia
We use the Digitron brand name instead of the word calculator, because it has become the most famous company that produced calculators in Yugoslavia
There is a food company called "Aleva", and it was the first producer of minced paprika here
So instead of minced paprika, people tend to say Aleva paprika for every minced paprika they see
Rizle, rolling paper brand, we call every rolling paper rizle now
We use the term "labelo", from the brand Labello, to refer to lip balm
Yes
Eurokrem - Eurokrem is our version of Nutella, but we call every chocolate sauce Eurokrem
Džip - from Jeep, a 4x4 vehicle
Sellotape - Cellux
UHU for glue stick
Digitron for Calculator (Digitron was actually a company that produced calculators in Yugoslavia)
Coca Cola for basically any type of cola
Even in LIDL
And that one is even made in Bosnia I believe
Some English fuckwit asked me does my family own Hercegovačka Gračanica church in Trebinje
Shame
It would be perfect example of natural selection
Yeah, we say "unutrašnjost", which literally translates into "the insides", for pretty much everything that is not Belgrade (plus two larger cities)
While it's a generally accepted term and used on TV and such, it can definitely be used to with a derogatory or condescending connotation to talk down on people who are from smaller places and the stigma that usually comes with it
Belgrade is to Serbia what Paris is to France, people like to act smug and like they are better than the rest of the country (especially if their family comes from Belgrade)
The other part of the country can be called provincija if you want to be politically correct but there is often more vulgar term "vukojebina" meaning hellhole, literal translation "place where wolves fuck", mind the language
Also I know people born in Novi Sad like to call people who come to live there "dođoš" which has sort of look down on feel to it, meaning "the one who came".
In Serbia we have the term "unutrašnjost" which translates to "the insides" or "the inner parts".
Everything outside Belgrade is Provincija or Unutrašnjost
Except maybe Novi Sad, never heard anything about Novi Sad being refered like that
Basically only if you live near a border since there's small check points for locals
Generally almost never, we're not in the Schengen area so you gotta wait at the border if it's a busy day
My mom and dad go to Bosnia each month to refuel our car because it's cheaper
We were under Ottoman Empire for a long period so we picked up some Turkish words like peškir (towel),  alat (tools), bakar(copper), bubreg(kidney), burek(basically a pie made from meat), ćuprija(a thing in front of a house where you usually park your car), čaršav(sheet), čarape(socks), česma(water thing that you drink from), čelik(steel) etc
Don't quote me on this one but in Serbian word "Tepsija" meaning "casserole" came from Chinese, and word "Kovceg" meaning "Chest" came from Mongolian i suspect these words came via Turkish
Oh my God
I wouldn't have ever thought
Same in Serbia
It's for general education, we call it "gimnazija".
I never knew what it means or heard someone use ćuprija
air beater*
Whaaaaat, that's crazy
Varoš is also in Serbian, but kinda archaic and I don't hear it's used
Same with fruštuk, we know it means breakfast, but no one really uses it
You never heard someone say "ko ne plati na mostu, platiće na ćupriji" or "Na Drini ćuprija"? Or the town called Ćuprija
isnt that "most"?
I just love Polish "plażing" as a word, it's such a mood
Yeah, I think so
Really
I thought all the Serbs were running off to Austria not Switzerland
Both: 34
2% literate, 14
8% mostly literate, 51% unliterate
Female: 32

Tho this is whole population thats older than 15 years in 2011 so this is most likely different than now but still interesting nevertheless
I'm 13 and I live in Serbia aaaaaand
a lot of my classmates don't know how to do most things so they ask me to do them
BTW, I'm very computer literate
They can't even just get into Start or save a PowerPoint presentation
Зелезницка пруга (zeleznicka pruga), means train/rail track
Železnice is Railways in Serbian
A friend of mine went to a team building in Russia, they flew 2 hours away from Kazan with a helicopter in the woods and brought a doctor with them just in case
Anyway, freezing nights, hot days and oversized insects all around were worth the incredible scenery
Depends if he is a Serb it doesn’t matter where is he from
Really
I thought  the french have something against the spanish
Maybe I was misinformed that there is discrimination
My mom lived in Paris  when she was a teen, she told me that then  discrimination existed
Romania, we've been neighbours for centuries and yet never went to war against each other and we always helped each other as well in medieval times our noble families often married into each other
Romania, Greece, Russia - best ortodox brothers
Russia, it started when they helped us in fighting for independence against the Ottomans
Iiiiiii don't know man, we love you as a people, but as a country weeeelll I mean
Oldest has to be Greece though, we were on good terms with them since ever
Best neighbours ever
When were we friends
Oh really i didn't know that, here in eastern Serbia there is a lot of Vlachs/Romanians and we always lived good with them and marriages between Serbs and Vlachs are pretty normal
We've been fighting Greeks almost whole medieval period tho
Yeah, same goes for us
well, except the Black Sea lol
We love you
It wasn't out of hatred, we just expanded on each other
Even when we conquered each other we had respect for the opposing side
Ye but that doesn't make us oldest friends, and since we currently arent friends, i dont think it counts
You're forgetting the centuries of oppression under the Ottomans, so i don't think we are friends
Even before that Bosnian Kings were warring with Serbian empire/kingdom over territory
When the Empire fell they tried to sieze land
Its easy formula if you are a Slav Serbs don't get along with you and since you aren't Slavs and Greeks aren't as well we get along just fine
They are
Special
It's funny how we all know which country you are talking about
A girl at my uni has a red shirt that just says 'ketchup'.
Lol, good one
Hey neighbor, we're all in similar shit
Belgrade is the same but I think our guy will develop into a megaturd, might just become worse
We're pretty good in growing thieves and assholes here
Corona virus
Cases are doubleing every day,but our government doesn't seem to give a shit
We here haven't closed anything
Cases are doubleing daily,but the government doesn't give one
You could have translated that
TLDR: Everyone was wearing shoes made of fur with the hairy part inside to keep warm, while the Romanians inverted so the fur was outside to ease navigating the snowy mountains
Thus they became hairy-soled people
Yeah same here, kids being 14-15 and drinking like its end of the world
Here it's basically the norm
Pretty much all high-schoolers drink, and many smoke
Very very popular,it usually starts in middle school,yea in middle school
yea same here
After the last month elections, Serbia is one of two countries in Europe with no opposition in the parliament
The other one is Belarus
Only political orientations here are selfishness and greed
"Name Patronim Family name"
Meaning the given name, followed by parent's name (usually the father, but you can use mother's name too
Only rule is to allways us the same name), and then family name
Name and surname only
For paperwork there is also a patronymic
Nobody uses that
You always get your surname from your father
Our surnames came from the name or profession of one person from distant past
First step is to get the name (Jovan) or profession (Kovač - blacksmith)
Make it into a possessive form, because they are *his* kids (Jovanov, Kovačev)
Change the word into a diminutive, because the kids are little "versions of him" (Jovanović, Kovačević)
This is the reason why so many of our surnames ends with "ić" (similarly how there is "ski" or "ov/vna" for other Slavic languages)
First name + Surname and every single Serbian surname ends with "ић" (ic)
Same here
Just baptized name is usually your given name too
In Serbian we have somthing similar
It's not official in documents, but if a woman has her maiden name, - eva is usually added at the end
If she has her husbend's name, then - ka is added at thw end
So if we have Markovićeva, that means Marković is her surname, while if she's called Markovićka, that means Marković is her married name
So when a woman has 2 surnames, for example Marija Markovićeva Jovanovićka, that would mean Marković is her surname, and Jovanović is her married name
This is rarely used today tho
Does czech law allow special/non-czech characters in official documents for naturalized citizens
I've seen people with serbian/croatian surnames (ending in - vić or - ić), so I wounder if they can keep thair name's spellings
Like, would someone called Đorđe be requiered to change his name spelling to Ďorďe upon naturalization
Probably yes in some countries (Russia, Bulgaria), but it's not general rule
Although in Serbia -ov surname is rare (we add additional -ić), it would be grammatically correct to add -a for female although in Serbia we don't.
Markov - Marco's (son)
Markova - Marco's (daughter)
>Fyi, our keyboards do support almost every special character that can be written in latin alphabet
Ours too
Same rAlt as switch for spetial characters
But I can't get used to czech keyboard, whit numbers being á é ě í ó and so on
Thankfully, everythibg can be written easily
Well, almost every day
And č, ž and š are part of our alphabet (guess where we got it from )
I would fight the Turks, I guess
Maybe a merchant considering my city was an Austro-Hungarian trading hub at the time
Austrian then, it was even given a status of a free city by Maria Theresa
Yes, if China wouldn’t squeeze us by the balls
So, no
Just like the rest of the world
Im used to help some family with airbnb hosting, here in serbia
So imagine my shock when a couple of Bulgarians, a country we share a border with, and have had some major interaction with throughout history, asked me WHETHER DOGS ARE EATEN IN SERBIA
So, during a zoom call to a client in the UK, the lady asked if we have mosquitoes in Serbia
We all said yeah, we do
she then asked if we feel them biting us at all, or are we just used to it, as we are natives
I swear I imagined us all as a tribe in the Amazon rain forest
Is that a thing anywhere in europe now
It is real mountain, people think it is not
Thst is the first time I've ver heard thst rumor and I've lived here for 25 years
Fazon
I literally don't know how would you translate it
It can mean anything from "joke" to "trick", but I mostly see it used as a sentence filler, which might be why I don't know a proper translation
Wow, I didn't know that
I know there is a lot of hungarian words in serbian, I guess I shouldn't be surprised fazon is present in both
Funny how it has no overlaping meanings
Thanks for the insight
The so-called [Toblerone building]
Yes, you can chose between your religion class (my school had Orthodox and Catholic aswell as Greek Catholic teachers but this depends on the region as south Serbia has also muslim teachers) and civil studies
They mostly teach you about the tenets of your religion and depending so I went to Orthodox class and it was basically an excuse to chill with friends and bore your professors about aliens especially since the class grade doesn't go to your grade point average
You choose between Religious education and one other subject about society and stuff
So yes if you want to, no if you don't want
It's a good solution imo
And I should say that most people nowadays choose the other one, so religious people are a minority (in this age group I mean)
In my class of 23, 5-6 of us chose RE
Hey that really depends, in some schools most kids choose RE
If I understand it right it's mostly societal pressure
I'd remove this subject from the school anyway, it's much much better that you learn religion in church, right
There could be some kind of sunday school, or some kind of public outreach or something
Men like to kiss each other on the mouth when they meet
The Germans especially
It's the European version of howdy neighbor
Yeah, over there it's just Russians waiting to kidnap you
(I think some Americans do actually think that Eastern Europe is like that)
Most likely Niš or Novi Sad, while I personally prefer Niš, I think Novi Sad would fit better as a capital as it's a little bigger
Although, Kruševac was the capital city at one point in Serbian history, and it's located in Central Serbia, but I don't know if a 60k population city would work well as a capital
If you believe what our politicians say, very important
Even more than some member states, that is why they are pressuring some issues because they can't wait we join in
It's not, not anymore at least
The EU as it stands doesn't want us nor has need of us
Unlike Bulgaria and Romania who technically border Russia via sea and could have fallen into the Russian sphere of influence that simply doesn't matter for Serbia considering right now we're surrounded by NATO and EU members anyways
The EU sort of abandoned us and just doesn't need us right now but if it was serious about expanding we'd be the first on that list
Likewise Serbia seems to have abandoned any hope of joining as it furthers away from EU standards
Probubly Czech or Slovak (ó gave them away)
Yeah, but we don't use ó, while they use š, ž and č
But this is mocking of english spelling (or lack there of)
Gross oversimplification
As wise people said, every problem has it's roots in certain event that happened in the past
Balkan history is deeply correlated with it's geostrategic position, which was between (at the time) powerful Middle East and Western Europe
Later Russia joined the game, so we had Austria-Hungarians, Turks and Russians all trying to assert dominance in the region, which greatly influenced strategic position of nationalities  in then poor areas of Balkan that were occupied by both Turks and Austria - Hungarians
This is basically the core of modern day controversies and problems Balkan had and still has, not "primitive Balkaners arguing for no reason whatsoever".
The core of the problem in Balkans was it's geostrategic position
Looking at the map, it's very obvious being between Middle East (which was very powerful and influential region) and Western Europe would cause a bloodbath in the region
You can also add Russia in the mix, which is the reason why Caucasus struggle (being inbetween Middle East and Russia)
As most of the Balkan was under Ottomans for centuries, main goal of every major nationality being occupied was creating a state
Problem was national identities weren't so strong back than and lot of locals were purposefully assimilated and tortured by Ottoman autorithies
When wave of nationalism striked the area in 19th century, lot of those nations got their long waited statehood (Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Montenegro)
However, problem was there were still some areas which were influenced my multiple nationalities, such as Macedonia (which was a mish mush of Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian customs)
Throw into the mix Croats, Slovenes and Albanians that were still ruled by Austria - Hungary when wave of nationalism striked Europe, lot of ethnically mixed regions which are claimed by multiple nationalities, and it's obvious why there were (and still are) so many disputes and clashes in the region
I can go on for days, but this is basically in a nutshell
In Serbia there are usually two shifts in each school
First shift starts at 8 am, second starts at 2 pm
Class length is the same as yours, and there's also 5 minute breaks between classes, but after 2nd class we have a lunch break which is 20 minutes long
That goes for both elementary and high schools, but somewhere there are schools that only work from 8 am
We never have more than 7 classes per day, bc first shift would get mixed with second, and second shift would finish it after 8 pm, which is a bit late for the school kids
Here in Serbia we go to school from 7:30 am to 1:30 pm, one class is 45 minutes in-between classes are 5 minute breaks except between the 2nd and 4th class(15 mins), those are "morning classes" it's basically the same for "afternoon" classes but they start at 1:30 pm and end at 7:30pm
The student switch the "shifts" once a month
I'm in 8th grade in Serbia so it's typically like this without isolation:
Wake up at 7am
Go to school at 7:30am
School starts at 8am
Class, little break, class, big break, class, little break, class, little break, class, little break, class, go home at around 1:10pm
*1  class is 45 minutes long, little break is 5 minutes, big break is 20 minutes
Eat lunch
Study until around 3pm or so
Do nothing the rest of the day
A day while quarantine is:
Wake up whenever
Watch TV  1:15pm-3:30pm  because thats how we go to school now I guess
Check Google Classroom if there are any tasks we need to do
If not, do nothing
If there are, do them and then do nothing
No, we don't have mixed shifts
I only said they would interfere with each other if there were more than 7 classes in a day
Our schools have a big amount of students, and you can't just put them all in the school at the same time
In elementary school, there were 6 classes in each grade, and we have 8 grades of el
school
Eg: when the school starts, the first three classes of all grades have subjects from 8 am, and the other three classes of all grades have subjects from 2 pm
In high school it's a bit different
In my school there are four years of studying
And, for example, in the first shift, there are first and the third grades, and in second are second and fourth grade
Shifts are changed weekly, so one week you go to school in the morning, and other week at noon, then again in the morning
This is the easiest way to describe it, I don't know if you'll understand completely, but I hope you get it
Bruh I've seen the word for the first time yesterday and now this
In Serbia, we give presents on New Year (1
january), but Christmas is celebrated on 7
january (like Russians, cuz our Orthodox church still uses old calendar)
New Year is usually spent with friends tho (like partying and that stuff), and Christmas is a very close familly day with usually no presents, but usually expensive feast takes place, its sort of like US Thanksgiving (tho some people still go to party for Christmas, which is nonsence)
7th January
We are fasting 40 days before the day
We basically don't eat any animal product, be it meat, fat, milk, eggs
The exception is, obviously, fish
On the Christmass eve (Badnje veče), we (formally) go to woods and chop a branch of oak (Badnjak)
Nowadays, you go to nearby shop and just buy a piece of it
That oak is brought to the home
Later that day, all the neighboring homes come together at the local church and we put all the oaks into the flames
Early in the morning everyone goes to church
Also, by tradition, you can't stop fasting until the special guest called Položajnik comes, which is also early in the morning
He should bring apple with coins inside of it
By tradition, this person brings luck, happiness and piece to the home
The person is then offered non fasting food, and he should take the first bite
Only then can others continue with their normal eating
On the Christmass day, when two people meet, person who is first to greet says "Hristos se rodi" (Christ is born) to which the greeted person answers "Vaistinu se rodi" (He is indeed)
Edit: how could I forgot
On Christmas day, we also throw wheet seeds at each others
January 7th
It's celebrated only religiously beacuse we celebrate new year with presents and such
Belgrade and Novi Sad mostly, NS specifically because of Exit Music Festival
Bulgarians frequently come to the area along the border (Stara Planina, Sokobanja spa, Pirot, Bosilegrad, Dimitrovgrad, Rtanj mountain)
I am not sure how many foreigners come to our mountains Kopaonik and Zlatibor but they're very famous tourist spots among Serbs
For me personally, I think I can name all 50, and brobubly even map most if not all of them
Capitals, however, are different story
Without googling, I could probably name two thirds of them, maybe more
I know even where are some of them on the map and maybe even a few cities
Let's give it a try
Main, Newfoundland, Pensilvania, New York, Washington, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Arkansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Michigan, Illinois, Oregon, Nebrasca, Connecticut, Delaver, Indiana, Georgia, Virginia, Missouri, Maryland, Idaho, Hawai, Alaska, Alabama, North Dakota, South Dakota(?), Wyoming
I could probably scrap up some more, if I shake my brain up a little bit more
Mississippi
We know where are the big ones (by area and popularity) like TX, NY, CA
All others are just familiar
That is if someone said Arkansas, we would know that it is a state, but not much more about it
However we do know about geographical stuff, like deserts, mountains, rivers etc
How do you now witch is witch
Ich nicht spricht deutschland
Hungarian
Hands down
All the vocals and accents are crazy
I can say every person that is not directrly from Serbia cannot speak our language completely right
Even some Serbian people can't speak Serbian right
Spanish and German gave me headaches
you learnt latin but struggle with Russian
I don't live in the EU
I actually don’t like EU but i think in different form it would be amazing
We don't have any really special idiocy, except the well known 'we are the people of the heaven' and 'at that point in history people in our court used forks and the west used fingers for eating'. But choose *any* of the regular idiotic , evil and sick beliefs and I know people who believe it IRL
Which is completely nuts
We're nuts
Regarding the last thing, about the detergents, wasn't there a woman from Czech Republic a couple of years ago that was fighting for a law to get companies to export the same, western europe quality of stuff to eastern europe, and I THINK she specifically mentioned Poland
And I think she took some yoghurt and chocolate from Nestle as example
I remember hearing something about it, and hearing about how she had some strong evidence, but I didn't know it was a conspiracy
Sorry for confusing English in advance, will post source when I figure out how to look for it
Edit: Found it, I meant on this:
It's a shame when people spew crap like that, since 5g really is dangerous - for our wallets
It's marketing wank for something that is better done by doing 4g properly
But no, these fucks think it's.. what, gonna deactivate their crystals or some shit
I saw that video, that's so insane lmao
Almost every arthical there is has a Serbian translation
Often when I can't remember the word in Serbian, I go to wikipedia in English, and change the language
same in serbia, tap water is drinkable but it has a hard feeling to it, almost hard to swallow hahaha
You squeeze the bottle, if it is rock solid, it's probably sparkling
Helps when you're in countries where you absolutely don't know the language
It's very drinkable in Niš, where are you from
it is drinkable in prishtina but it tastes very hard
i prefer to drink bottled water like prolom
Cultural and linguistic erasure in Subotica, Serbia
The northernmost city in Serbia, it has (or used to at least) a majority ethnic Hungarian population
Due to its cultural ties to Hungary, historically, it was always more Central European in culture, religion, language, government and architecture
Since the unification with Yugoslavia and especially since the creation of Serbia, the Hungarian people have been segregated and provoked
I am saying this as a person of mixed Serbian, Croatian and Hungarian descent and I do not think Subotica should join Hungary or sth like that, but I think that an approach of more equal representation for all ethnic groups in the city would be better
Zaragoza
Never heard of it before and I'm surprised since it looks like a very pretty city, other than that I've noticed I don't know many other spanish cities either, gotta work on that
You have been to Kosovo but not to Serbia lol that's a rare one (unless you count Kosovo as a part of Serbia idk what's your view on that)
Cool, have you enjoyed your time there
My advice for learning any language is to learn the alphabet first then words then phrases
Listen to the locals talk as much as possible
Just imagine that you are a 1 year old and you are learning your native language
Go to the south so you don't have to learn cases
What, in Serbia when someone is even trying to speak our language we get so excited someone is even trying so we continue talking to them in our language
What
It is not that hard to spell in french
Comparing to english spelling writing/ spelling in french is a piece of cake
Thank you lord for TV5MONDE
Idk i started learning it when i was 7
I got used to ait ais est e, etc
Verbs aren’t easy i still go to nouvel observateur to look up the conjugation of some irregular verbs
What do you think of the spelling on[this instagram page] ? Are younger generations starting to spell simpler
I mean is there a tendency to start spelling easier the language
Ugh I hope that severity will change someday soon
I agree it is actually the most beautiful language on earth
Alcohol consumption
Even devout muslims in Europe drink a lot
'Why did you leave the door open
Were you born on a raft
'Don't leave the window open, wind (idk how to translate promaja) will kill you'
Thats the most common saying in every country
I watched a show on Viasat History that covered strange historic laws, and the host tested out them by both handling salmon suspiciously, even asking the police whether they knew about the law (they didn't), and by walking into the Parliament in a suit of armour
He was like
carrying it around the street with a suspicious look on his face and he was like
a spy
"Write as you speak and read how it's written"
Well we speak as we write and we write as we speak, so yes
We have a proverb, 'write like it's spoken, and speak like it's written'. We learn it in the first grade of elementary school
It's the basis of our language
100% of the time
Our alphabet is phonetic
Yes
Always
Every letter has it's own sound
For example c is always c no matter what comes after (unlike Spanish ce and ca)
There are no exceptions
It's 100% phonetical
Exactly
Phonetic spelling is the whole point of our language
Wow that is fascinating I had no idea the č ć distinction was a problem for Croatians
The only one I can think of is "tamo gde i car ide peške" which translates to "there, where the emperor goes on foot"
I call it the OFFICE
Kenjara (shitter) as well
We have a similar story in Serbia, but one this one is historically true
King Uroš I was married to a French princess Hellen of Anjou and she was ill or sad (I can't remember right now) so he planted thousands of lilacs which are still there today in a valle known as Dolina jorgovana(Valley of lilacs)
There's a barbeque festival in my city every year and usually the first night there's tons of fireworks
Plus the music gets so loud that you can hear it from distant parts of the city
A drunk Serb wanted to fire a canon in 1804 in the middle of the night and ended up killing the Ottoman officer who commanded the local army which fought the Serbian revolutionaries
Yes, Gamzigrad
It's near Zajecar and it's fairly preserved too
It's the Felix Romulian palace I think
There are also busts of the Emperors there too
A lot, there's even 2 sets in my city
I live in Sirmium which was the capital of it for a period
The first one is outside and can be climbed on, and children like playing on it
Though, now they transformed it into an external stage for festivals like Folk Fest, concerts etc
The second one is well preserved in a closed area which can be looked at through a window in a cafe or on a street
Both of these are ruins of 2 castles that probably collapsed or something
Besides my city, there's Gamzigrad and other places intended for preserving these ruins
There are roman baths in the center of my city of Čačak
There are a lot of major once all around the country as well
Naisus aka modern Niš among them
Yea, there is a few ruins, also the capital Belgrade is a roman city, along with Nis, Sremska Mitrovica, Zemun ...
What an understatement for Serbia
14 Roman emperors were born on the modern territory of Serbia, we had several Roman cities, the largest being Sirmium which was coincidentally 4th capital city of Rome
Felix Romuliana was a complex of palaces and resorts built by Galerius
There are also several cities that were further built by Romans, most notably the capital, Belgrade, or Singidunum as it was called back then
Remains of the original fort can be seen on the Belgrade fortress as well as numerous of marble statues and structures
Here in Serbia if you are not at home the delivery guy is not going to leave the package because you have to sign for it
Or you will get a paper notification left in your mailbox if the package was delivered by state owned Pošta Srbije
But two months ago there was a huge outrage with state owned Postal service because packages from AliExpress were stolen by its employees
And since packages weren’t received by those who paid for them, they complained to AliExpress and got their money back, but that left sellers without money and the goods
So sellers just decided to stop sending stuff to Serbia or to use DHL only as a delivery option, which is extremely expensive
No, packages are delivered directly to you and if you're not home they leave it at the post office where you have to retrieve it from
Basically all the other comments
Same rules are applied everywhere
Everything is done in person, and it must be signed
If you're not there, you're left a slip that you can take to your nearest post office to pick up the package
Y'all ever seen Podgorica
Big yikes from me
Zvolen definitely, specially during the winter
Agreed, Sofia was probably the most bland Capital I've ever been to
That's just my experience, especially as a kid I remember how boring and bland it was
It literally felt exactly like a commie block in my city but the whole city is like that and extremely hot in the summer
Counterpoint: Belgrade is in no way boring
It's chaotic and a pain to live in, but exciting as hell
The coast, that's where half of Serbia goes to vacation at least
I agree with you on that, but I don't see how this has to do with Podgorica
Yuuuuup
It's driving me and everyone else in here insane too
The way I cope with it is that I walk everywhere
I change flats frequently so I can always live near things I need to visit frequently (Currently: girlfriend, job and gym), and use the city transport only when going out of that area to see friends or events
As a Novi Sad native obviously I'm gonna recommend my own city
If you show up during Christmas (January 7th) it's gonna be super cheery
There's plenty of museums to visit and places to check out and especially it's a city where people like to relax a lot so spending a lot of time in a coffee shop during the winter is great
There's also a huge mall in the city for all shopping needs
It's pretty flat which is why I like it over Belgrade (and it's home) so there's no hills and you won't get too tired of walking around
It generally probably will be quite cold so dress warmly
As for safety I don't think you have to worry anywhere in Europe for that really
Novi Sad is very safe and so is the rest of Serbia
Night life is great, Novi Sad is Europe's Youth capital this year I think
I believe there are frequent meetups for travelers as we get loads of tourists but I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly where sadly
Food is pretty cheap compared to Western European countries
I’m pretty sure most Eastern European countries have fairly cheap food
Bread here is 20¢
Bread is ~0
50$ here
Cigarettes
For us here, that price js high (3 euros for marlboro red) but I think for the rest of Europe it is quite cheap, correct me if I’m wrong
i heard that in the UK, a pack of cigarettes costs 10£
Malta says hello to used RHD cars
This is true, I was always amazed at how cheap water in Greece is
Haahahahaahaahahahhahahahaahahhahaha
crtani - drawn (cartoon)
sladoled - sweet ice (ice cream)
visibaba - hanging old lady (snowdrop)
samoubica - only killer (suicidal person)
mišići - little mouses (muscles)
Sarajevo - Sara is an ox (the capital city of Bosnia)
Nilski konj = the Nile horse (hippopotamus)
I'll never think about Sarajevo the same after this
Good one

Mar Adentro is amazing
It exists
Kusturica is indeed best director we have, but people need to know Balkan's mentality to understand them
Rane is also one of greatest movies in the last 20 years
Sadly not

Baba daruje hranu (paprikas, probably :-)
Yeap, can confirm sounds slavic
When I lived in Romania, first few months i was so confused how can I almost get the context of what people say sometimes, without ever knowing any word of  Romanian
Since i also speak Italian you can imagine level of confusion
Pihtije, čvarci, krvavica, jagnjeće sarme
Oh, we also eat almost all entrails of an animal, my favorite is the brain of the fier baked pig
I love pihtije/hladetina
Altho I think these are not the same thing
Škembići are awesome
can you price some random things
anything that comes to mind, i want to see how pricy are you ;D
Can I copy your homework
Know what I will just do it
In Serbia everyone uses it, and it can be spelled like OK/Ok (most common), okay, okej or oke
I wanted to exclude brackets but i was afraid it is to much
Long story bro
-"How is a common country with our Croatian brothers going
-"Uhm we didn't really get along, I guess
Yeah about that pan-slavic country idea
"Soo the country changed its name and borders like 20 times and fought a lot of wars and now everyone is leaving and we are fucked"
Same old,same old
But you still employ Bosnian workforce
Hey, at least we didn’t stole your Transylvania
You see, this is actually sixth  or seventh state, after your departure
What a dumb and false statement with absolutely no historical evidence to back it up
• Serbia won WW1 I don't think it was expected for them to give up power to those that fought on the opposite side like Croatians
• Serbians were the most populous ethnic group by a huge difference
Croatians weren't satisfied with what they had and wanted to be on equal footing as Serbs by territory even though they were in a minority
• Stejan Radić wasn't killed because he was a Croat, but because he also offended Račićes wife
Was this justified, no of course not and he got arrested for it but Radić as I said also advocated for policies that would give Croatians large amounts of power despite them being a minority
Only after this was the dictatorship called because of the differences in views that were so radical you couldn't agree on anything
• You also completely neglected to mention that Croatians got exactly what they wanted in the end in the form of Banovina of Croatia but that wasn't enough for them
• Is this how you run a pan Slavic state
No obviously not, people should have an equal say in the ideal world but couple the fact that Serbs would have to give up a large amount of not only territory but power (considering they were WW1 victors) to their former enemies, it was ludicrous
• This only proves my point because the first thing Tito did was split core Serbia into Macedonia and Montenegro, give a large amount of Serbian territory to Croatia and Bosnia and cripple the Serbian government by separating it into two provinces
A Yugoslavia can't exist if Serbia isn't a cripple old man
Likely but I guess we'll never know
I was just trying to prove my point that calling Yugoslavia a 'Greater Serbia' is ludicrous
The entire Balkans, but specifically Serbia and Bosnia
Bulgaria as well
[Ub] Serbia comes to mind
We should do this with Slavic languages too
Speak portuguse fluently having lived in Brazil for most of my life
The French one was about a city(maybe region) of an area of France
Understood most of it
Spanish was very easy, about a J.K Rowling book
Italian was also suprisingly easy
It was about the soviet communist party
Romanian was about a battle during the war of the Roses
Surprisingly hard
I mostly knew what it was about because it mentioned houses York and Lancaster and Henry Tudor
Catalan was about a swimmer
Harder then spanish but still not hard
Galician was very interesting, it was just like portuguese but with weird spelling
It was about a Mozart symphony
Foreign but it's definitely saddening, it's more of a mark of humanity than anything and in itself it's a great historical and architectural treasure
Everyone else in Serbia is hating on Belgrade and people there
But the joke's on them, Belgrade is nothing else than a microcosm of the whole Serbia, so they're hating on their own behavior
To my Serbian ears your sentence sounded like "hey man, do you have a chewing gum". Now I'm interested what it really means lol
Well, Serbia has a chaotic history
The last time a big government collapse occured was when Slobodan Milošević was overthrown, after which a democratic coalition came to power
which then also collapsed due to the Kosovar independence crisis
They were voted out of power around 4 years after Kosovo declared independence, I wouldn't say that was the only reason they lost the election
In Serbia almost every young person knows English, but also a good amount of them German, since both are taught in schools (and they are mandatory), and how I heard from tourists they didn't had any problems with communication in English
I through that it's the same in every country, but I'm really wrong
For example in Romania, there was absolutely NOTHING written in English
Once we went to an ATM and we didn't understood a single word there because everything was written in Romanian and there was no option to choose another language
We asked some people to help, but no one knew English
In the end we went to a pharmacy to ask the worker to help and she thankfully knew English
It was very frustrating
Similar experience in Hungary
People who need to know English they do know it, for example managers and cashiers, but regular people rarely
I'm not saying we are the only non-English people who know English, I'm just retelling my experience
How I see from other answers, I believe it's just bad luck
Knowing English is a norm
We also learn the 3rd language, but it's not obligatory in every high school so people here know 2-3 languages (including the first language)
I like how Croatia understands design
It seems like it's a real part of the culture
Also Vojko V
Albanians are completely unified as a people no matter the religion
Truer words haven’t been spoken since the ‘90s.
Honestly true
Actually onions
Flair checks out
I was supposed to go to Uffizi on a school trip last year, but the gallery had some special event and we weren't able to enter even though we have paid for the tickets earlier
F them
Does it count if I spoke in another language so my parents couldn't hear me
We LOVE when someone is soeaking Serbian, even if the speaker knows only a few words
We would quickly then continue in English if we see that they are struggling, but would give them a chance
Some kind of soup + vegeta definitely
Oh and browned flour
Something with cabbage, minced meat (I'm aiming at sarma) and definitely some alcohol such as rakija or vinjak (brandy)
These days the smell would be smog due to pollution
balm for all the senses
In Serbia, we are losing around 50 000 people per year on a population of 6
9 million
You can really notice that when you go to villages
Some of the villages are completely empty and they look pretty creepy with all the empty houses and barns

Happy cake day
Legalized
It's unreal how backwards Europe is about weed compared to Americans (both North and South)
Thankfully we dont have that here
There is a unwritten law which in short says:,,Any one deemed a cannibal is automatically killed
"and thank god for that
legalize cannabis then make tobacco and alcohol illegal
It should be mandatory for high school, university and all workplaces
But siriusly, yes, it should be legalized
Why do you think this
I mean, I see you are saying it in spite of the fact that most of the sales of alcohol and tobacco are legal and taxed sales
So even though we have actual reality to show us that there are actual solutions that mostly work you want to not use the systems that work
When i was like 10 yo, i was convinced Portugal and The Netherlands are neighbor countries, and I absolutely have no idea why I thought that
Prague, Budapest, Belgrade, Dubrovnik, Palermo
On route, if going by car/bus/train you can stop in Vienna, Novi Sad, Zlatibor mountin, Sarajevo, Reggio Calabria
Barcelona, London, Venice or Rome, Athens, St Petersburg or Moscow
How much of a Brittish stereotype are you
Just curious
No, no one uses generational names
There is a difference between generations, but it's really not on anyone's minds that much
I think the generational conflict was much bigger 30,40+ years ago
Young people here don't think much differently than their parents, while my parent's generation had a huge problem with their parents about stuff like rock music, weed, parties, discos, dating, etc
It's honestly irritating to be bombarded by all this ''boomer, millennial, zoomer'' stuff recently, over internet
I think it went too far, and is in line with current trend in America to label certain social groups and then just pin bunch of stereotypical attributes to them
As if society is not already divided enough
Not really, only the label of 90s kid exists
i (and), a (conjunction for two actions that are not same or related), u (in), o (about), k (towards), s (with)
e and o also mean "hey" but it's up to you if those are the words
i (and), o (about), u (in), s (with)
Yes
"i" (and), "a" (but/while), "o" (about), "u" (in) are the ones I can think of now
There are also "s" (with) and "k" (/), but they are just shorter versions of "sa" and "ka".
And - i
Oh - o
Serb (Serbo-Croatian too)
U (in)
I (and)
O (about i guess i dont really know)
У(in), и(and), c(abbreviation of with, normally ca), a(abbreviation of but, normally али)
Same here, but switch *v* with *u*, *z* is *iz*, and *u* means *in*.
That myth is made by business owners so employees wouldn't find out that the owner is underpaying some of them
(Found this in r/youshouldknow)
How else am I supposed to know the horrible extent to which I'm being underpaid
Sfar as I'm aware, it's common with younger people who don't have very stable jobs, but with people who do it depends on what the conversation is and who they are talking to, so I think it is quite rarer
By far the green ones
I see red olives more often than the black ones
99% of the time
Even when they are 8 years old
I was 7 (1st grade) when I first went alone to school
It was like 5 minutes bus drive
Then we moved like 30 minutes bus drive away and I went with my parents during 2nd grade (8yo) but only because maybe I would lost myself in the city
After some time they've let me go alone
I'd consider my city (capital Belgrade) a very safe place to walk
I've walked countless times late at night from the other part of the city (like 1 am to 3 am walk) because I don't have a car
It is in my opinion way too cramped with information, they should have made more space between the lines or something
[Serbian one]
I like ours actually, its a cool design in my opinion
But our passports are way cooler with those like anthem lyrics noticable in the light
Exactly, but for ID I'd personally remove "valid until" dates to the backside so name and age, personal number etc
could stand out better
This is very hard to answer for a Serbian, as Serbia's borders and the Serbian cultural area changed all the time
Serbia, as a country, didn't exist in 1600, 1700 or 1800
Should I consider Neusatz (today Novi Sad) the largest city, even though it was a part of the Habsburg monarchy or Belgrade, even though it was a part of the Ottoman Empire
As I said, it's very hard to answer
1900: Belgrade
Beč in serbo-croatian
Tbf we stole that from Hungarian during Austro-Hungarian presence in Balkans, but nevertheless name stayed the same
Yeah, yeah that's it
Fascinated by the English language ever since we started learning it in primary school when I was like 7
Watched Disney cartoons in English, listened to British music, watched American series, read British and American literature
later, in high school, we also started writing tons of essays and letters in English and I've also been experimenting with story-writing in English, though honestly my stories aren't so good because I'm overall a bad writer with badly thought out ideas, not just in English
(or at least that's the opinion I have of myself)
Asides from the literature, music and TV, I also use social media almost exclusively in English and I talk to foreigners more than I talk to people from my own country, so I guess that helped a lot
Online games, more specifically MMOs and listening to others
The way I learned 99% English and the reason I can do an English test 100% intuitively is because of video games and youtube
Especially minecraft since I would put the game in english and try to guess what each item was
Intuitive grammar came from videogames,youtube and a little bit of it came from school(eg
How certain tenses are built; so basically I knew grammar but didnt know how it was built)
Started when I was about 5 in kindergarten, started speaking it "fluently" when I was 13, thanks to some kids from UK I was hanging out with
Sadly, my german never took the same route
I can usually differentiate people from Bosnia and sometimes from Croatia
It sounds ridiculous because we are the same ethnicities but there are subtle difference in the heigh and hair colors
The posture and the accent give it away also
There is a bit difference in our language
The Bosnian language is like old Serbo-Croatian with a some words that are specific to Bosnian language
Modern Serbian is different language
But still those languages are similar enough that we can understand each other
When you want to go to your next door neighbor, start up the car, make sure it works by bringing it to 4000RPM per minute for 10 seconds
After that go to your neighbor's house say hello to them, then bring back your car (test to see if it works again) and then enter the neighbor's house
Works for me every time
Izgubljen kao kuče u liftu - Lost (confused) like a dog in the elevator
Kao tele u sarena vrata - (Someone is staring at something) As a calf at a colorful door

(for cluster\*\*ck event / clumsy person)
100 kilos pig, 200 kilos grease - joke about people from my city, rest of Serbia says we lie a lot
We have Matica srpska originally founded in Hungary (outside of Serbia) but it's now located in Novi Sad (the 2nd biggest city in Serbia)
I've biked along Neringa last year, it's absolutely gorgeous
Also, nature aside, the villages on the spit are incredibly picturesque, especially Nida
No particular order, and no links, for I'm lazy and on the phone:
EKV, Idoli , Električni Orgazam, Bijelo Dugme (technicly bosnian, but its exYu, so it counts), Tap 011, Negative (band), Yu grupa, Smak
There is a lot, this is only my current playlist
The songs that every Serbian knows are the following:
Djudjevdan
Tamo Daleko
Vivovdan
Sini jarko sunce sa Kosova
Most popular singers that people have been listening to recently are the following:
Mc Stojan, Voyage, Breskvica, Coby, Rasta, Tanja Savic, Relja, Klinac
Most popular songs:
Mc Stojan - La Miami
Mile Kitic - Kilo dole Kilo gore
Rasta - Euforija, Kavali
THCF x Coby - Krvavi Balkan
Severina x  Ministrake - Uno Momento (Croatian/Serbian)
Serbian singers that have been in the game for a long time are the following:
Ceca - Beograd, Kukavica (2 of the many famous songs she has)
Dragana Mirkovic
Djani
Nedeljko Bajic- Snovi od Stakla
Seka Aleksic
Saban Saulic
That's a really good one, it has a shit ton of (pretty good) covers in other languages too, although, admittedly, none are as good as the original
[Here's the Serbian cover]
"For them" and reality
If he has the "Cyprus" flair I'm gonna bet Greek
Characters who speak American southern accent in original sometimes speak some kind of southern dialects or accents in Serbian, because they're often seen as rural or uneducated dialects
Oh hell yeah, people in the south don't even use padeži!
Serbian language is mainly divided to 3 dialects
Furthermore, every dialect group is divided by local accents (there are 9 sub-dialects in total, 6 of them in Serbia, and 3 spoken by Serbian people in Bosnia, Dalmatia and Slavonia)
I thought padeži are called cases
Jao izvini, moja greska
Mislio sam da si mi odgovorio na jedan drugi komentar gde pricam o glasovnim promenama, nisam pogledao
They are fucking stupid then
Čuvari prirode (guardians of nature) we had those classes in elementary school only and it's just like getting to know everything about nature, how to take care of it, and stuff like that
We have something similar but it's way less developed and more like
girls doing embroidery
It's elective subject (the other being technical and IT knowledge)
Belgrade has two major parts
City of Belgrade is located at the southeast side of Danube
New Belgrade is at the southwest side
The rest is suburban municipalities
We have Sremska Mitrovica and Mačvanska Mitrovica (Mačvanska Mitrovica is a part of municipality of Sremska Mitrovica, but it can be seen as a village or a small town)
They are divided by Sava (a river) and have a bridge in between
I’m afraid to mention Balkan wars lol
Literally every person has a different view on the Yugoslav wars
In middle school history class the teacher told us that if Serbia suffered a major loss in the 1389 Battle of Kosovo the European continent would have been overrun by the Ottomans at a much earlier age & with a greater force, probably ensuring permanent dominance of the Turks even today
Is it true
Have no idea
This isn't something that our books said, just teacher's POV but I bet not a lot of other countries have this event in the history book & probably don't see it like this anyway
In Serbia he's viewed positively as he's known to have given support to us during our revolution against the Ottomans
Verbal support that is
In Serbia when we learned about him we didn't necessarily say he was good nor bad
Though, we did learn he was a superior military commander, big IQ & very intelligent, etc
I listen to a podcast hosted by three Irishman called 80 days about various countries and territories around the world, and Irish regularly show up all over the globe
Actualy Napoleon was really harmful to our national liberation at the time
He supported the Ottoman Empire against Russia in the Russo-Turkish war
At that time, we were allied with the Russians in our fight against the Ottomans in the First Serbian Uprising
Serbian forces from Montenegro were fighting Napoleon's forces in in the Bay of Kotor instead of advancing against the Turks and linking up with forces from Serbia proper
Also when Napoleon invaded the Russian Empire, the Russians had to sign a peace with the Ottomans and leave us to our own faith
Thus the First Serbian Uprising was defeated in no small part because of Napoleon
Well try asking the land about its nationality
Yeah, Balkans
Actually we don't have beef with them
We know we came later but Vojvodina was barely inhabited and it was a frontier region so we kinda built everything here anyways
It doesn't. Iirc there was some controversy about it last year, but they ended up not joining
well Hungarians do have a longer history of Vojvodina inhabitance but it's not continual
During the Ottoman advance non-Serb population escaped, so the Hungarians from Vojvodina "only" trace their heritage to the late 18
century resettlement
....so Croatians
Yes, of course
Here in Balkans we upgraded
We have singers who built their careers on songs like that, their whole albums are offensive, and they are quite popular
There's a whole genre of music for offending Croats and Bosniaks and vice versa for them
Idk about others, but i listen to it when playing games with the boys
Isn't the guy banned like in half of Europe because of his ties with neo nazism lol
Crusader Kings 2: Havent played it much, I've played with Ireland, Castille and Francia
Europa Universalis 4: I've played with many countries, but mostly focused on Europe, I think I have the most games with Castille, the Ottomans and Austria
Victoria 2: Usually some great power or European secondary power, mostly France or Germany
Hearts of Iron 4: haven't played it much, only tried one game with Germany so far
CK3
I suck at it i so I go as a easy country like Sweden
EU4
I'm good at this one so I go as small countries often, sometimes I try Serbia I once managed to nearly reform the Roman empire as Serbia but then had some massive as coalition go against me that took everything except Constantinople and parts of Asia minor
It's also sometimes fun to play as a tiny German state but it is really hard
Victoria
I usually try Prussia or France but recently I've gotten a bit better at the game so i try Russia or the US
HOI4
I change it all the time mainly trying stupid weak countries (like Luxembourg)
I personally want to visit Beirut, Lebanon , Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Israel  or Istanbul, Turkey . But in theory the first one will be Dresden, Germany  visiting friends and family
I once saw an Oklahoma plate, and like 3 days ago I saw a Trump 2020 plate, but I don't think it is legal to drive with that thing lol
Saw a California plate on a massive vintage convertible in Belgrade, Serbia
Monkey [serbian - manki]
Not even our own translation of monkey (which would be majmun/мајмун), but a quite literal translation
I often heard people call it majmunče aka young/small monkey
We call it in Rs/BiH *Crazy A*  (Ludo a)
If Serbia is out or not in competition then any exYu, if not, then any European country or anybody against USA
Greece,Romania and maybe Russia
Usually Russia
Macedonia
That one's kinda weird lol
Same here, especially Ex-Yu countries but as well other Slavic nations
Hungary sometimes and Bulgaria
They indeed are
I mean they are not doing so badly when you look at the region
I think they are the only ex-Yu country with a positive population growth
This took a dark turn
I don't really think about them and when I do, I wonder why they haven't been just annexed by their neighbors
Just join us again so you won't be
Joking
Unless
>We are probably the smallest non-micro state in Europe
Montenegro is a lot smaller than you
I dont think it will escalate into ww3
But one thing is for sure, Iran and the USA will have a dick measuring contest that might get lots of people killed in the Middle East
And if does escalate, at least i have the comfort of knowing Serbia isnt bound by any deal to aid anyone
Imagine defending the US on these blatant war crimes and escalations
World's biggest aggressors
I think the Americans, known as the most gullible nation with most power in the world, are gonna eat this propaganda of Soleimani being a "terrorist" and that will cause a new instability in the region as soon Iranians return the favor of killing a high US representative
US is one of the worst countries in the world on many levels, it needs to be dealt with or this falling empire is gonna take the whole world down with it
Fuck Trump
Fuck US
Im glad the WW trilogy is coming to an end
We've been waiting for the third one long enough
Iranian companies will be bought by American businessmen and American businesses will start opening up in Iran, don't forget that
It would be nice for us to not have even  a cameo
Big countries are above the law
And people still wonder why europeans dont like americans
Nah
he was invited by Iraqi government
Stop spreading your bullshit around here you dumb burger
He ordered attack on US servicemen in the country bordering his, which they have no business being there in the first place
If that demonstration in front of the embassy is attack he organised, than he didn't know to organise one, because other than cosmetic damage to embassy, there was nothing else
Was this terrorist attack by US worth the dead that will come out of it as a response
I didnt mean that type of big
Iraqis protested, yeah there was tension, no one died
Do you remember why they protested in the first place
And what do you do after that, kill a top ranking general who probably didn't have anything to do with it and was invited by the Iraqi government
Hope Pompeo or any murican war criminal general dies next, after all they deserve it more than Quassem
R. I. P
>Or it would galvanize the population to become Uber patriotic and nationalistic
Europeans with flowers In their hair will understand this concept if/when that happens
Some Europeans have already experienced that, don't generalize that much
Maybe the US should retire every once in a while to think before it acts
I'm not
I'm sure that the man in that position deserves to burn in hell, if that place exists, but not to be sent in this maner
There will be other who will step in his place, but the action will not be forgoten
It could lead to another war with thousands of death and hundreds of thousands of lives destroyed for what
To show that US can drone strike you anywhere
Oh, you don't know us
We don't like anything that comes from the US government
We love Americans, tho
Go into the world stage and make actual changes and actions in the world and then you can talk about mistakes
Man, the whole of Europe's done so many things on the world stage, for better or worse, that it exhausted itself
What comes off as superiority is more of a warning due to lessons learned from European history itself
There would have been fewer problems in ME if western powers didn't meddle
The Europeans likewise caused or escalated certain conflicts that wouldn't have existed if they didn't act, but you won't hear people talk about them positively these days
Whatever happens, just don't take it too personally
Maybe the United States or Albania if things get heated
The USA/NATO
The whole western world
again
NATO could easily attack us because of Kosovo or Bosnia
* sad šajkača noises *
Ummm everybody around us, except maybe Hungary because we're currently bffs with Orban
Everyone
Just get everyone in there
Definetly the US, since Albania can hardly invade us alone
Ain't you currently being invaded by Bosnia
Nah we're pretty okay with you if you ask me
I just don't like your president that shows a lot of signs of hating Serbs, but I doubt Serbs would invade you
I was refering to the scenario if there was a war in Kosovo they would send people in
Although of course they wouldn't get far
I don't think any issues in the 90s. Besides of course you wouldn't because you're not as strong as you used to be
Stupid question, in Croatian Alps
Yes we do have better relations with them now, but if someone invaded us it would probably be them
Also, I agree that Romanians and Bulgarians wouldn't fight us, it would probably be Albanians
Yeah they would send people, but the question clearly mentions an invasion
They only trapped one Balkan country
I don't mean to sound like I'm provoking but Albania would likely have support from local Kosovars but in the end our military superiority would see it through
That is of course if it's alone but this is very unlikely or an invasion of any kind at all
Is Kosovo not our territory
Russia has recovered a lot since the 90s and China is a US competitor, both Serbian allies
If it was a war in Kosovo and he US actively helped like in the 90s likely NATO would win
I believe it would likely be the same just without the bombings
Yeah, "mlečni restoran" (milk restaurant), same principle
Here we have Russian kitchens
Like Mlecenzy bar,but Russian food
Idk why but I read Pizza Hut the first time,even though nearest pizza hut for me is in Moscow
In Serbian we call it "puškica" which is deminutive form of "puška"
Puška = gun/rifle
Similar to Hungarian we use "puškice" which are "tiny guns" :D
In Serbian we call it puškica which means a small gun
I still do not understand why we use it like that
Well, at least it seems that we ain't the only ones
Looks like Hungarians and Bulgarians use it as well
No but we definitely should
Kids backpacks are extremely heavy so it would be much better
Lockers were introduced to my primary school in Belgrade around 2013 and we were supposed to have two sets of books, one for school and one for home so our backpack is light
However kids tend to destroy lockers and since keys were so poorly made they were often broken, now they are still there but don't serve any purpose as far as I'm informed
There are rumors that Belgrade has massive undergrounds
Novi Sad has catacombs and tunnels built during the Austro-Hungarian era since it was a border city to the Ottomans in case of a siege or attack
There's a popular rumor that cults and the like meet there, claims justified by strange symbols and pentagrams seen by those who explore
Or it could just be bored teenagers, either way it's interesting
We have the biggest border dispute
The largest country by area fully in Europe
Most populous country and city in Europe too
50% - 32% - 16%
I mean yeah, but this is more unique
> And Russia started mobilising their forces several days ahead of Germany declaring war against both Russia and France
that's because Russia was already at war with A-H at that point
Ukraine and Moldova are not South Europe
OK you're right, Crimea is bigger than Kosovo (tbh I didn't know that)
But, no country recognizes Russian Crimea, while Kosovo is 50/50 so it's a bigger dispute that way
>As a diplomatic move, that had limited value since the Russians did not make this mobilisation public until 28 July
I'm not so sure about that anymore
At all time high, as far as education goes here, we started some of the most disgusting thing in our history, backed and designed by educated people
Today we have university on every street corner, degrees could be bought, curiculum for elementary and middle schools are archaic and burden to the students, who are left to learn on their own, if they want to know something other than basic stuff
Never seen anyone do it, not a thing here
No one ever says that here
In fact, we shouldn't talk with drivers at all, there are signs saying that
Mostly because you shouldn't disturb him while driving
Even if you want to buy a buss ticket you have to prepare the exact amount of money so that the driver doesn't bother counting the change
Absolutely not, it's very rare
Maybe if the bus driver was nice but usually they're douches and you don't even talk to them
Although we could start thanking god that we got off alive
They tend to be very rude
For instance when you give them a bigger bill they always complain or sometimes when they see you literally running towards the bus they go on purpose and they make a sarcastic shrug every time
I'm in France for several months and even in Savoie they thank the driver more often than not
I can't say I've been their fan for long or that I play too many games, but this was a pure disaster:
Mobile version of Diablo was released to appease the Chinese market because people go crazy for mobile games there
So, in addition to siding with Beijing, they destroyed the thing that made them stand out in the first place
It's a real shame, they spat on their audience and legacy
I'm always astonished by and angry at the greed companies display, and Blizzard perfectly displayed that
No one made them enter the Chinese market
No one made them sell out their company to shitty shareholders
Now when that bites them in the ass, they seek understanding and compassion from their customers who have nothing to do with that market
They could've successful enough to live a very comfortable life by sticking to just normal markets, instead, because of their greed, they've sunk to this depth of shame
Can't believe they went that far, it's extreme even for then
But honestly at the end of the day Blizzard is a business and China makes up a huge percent of their player base and income
Italy
Serbia, it's my own country but it has nice shape
croatia is eating bosnia
We have many ways to say that
Someone can "roar", "throw away the spoon" or "go to marble village". But my favourite is "hit the ground with your d***"
We also smell flowers from underneath
We just say that someone threw a spoon
(Bacio kašiku) (Бацио кашику)
I have never heard of it in Serbia, so it is probably unique for Slovenia
In fact, when you say that way death seems calm and peaceful, who wouldn't want to go whistle to crabs
I think our hospitality
We love when someone comes
We try our best to show you our country and culture in the best possible light
People here love to help each other
I mean the solidarity of random strangers is really strong
If you as a tourist come to us for directions, we'll try our best to help you
If you were to ride in our public transportation you would hear a lot of sorry's. The one bad thing is that we are one of Europes greatest smokers
However if you also smoke and are out of cigarettes, you can ask anyone on the street, and if they also smoke, they'll give it to you, sometimes even 2 or 3 so that you have for later
Isn't it "Hej Hej Monika"?
Kosovo
Its been rebeling and causing problems since the 80s
Kosovo and Metohija
KoSoVo
Apart from that, probably Novi Pazar (not a region but a city)
Lots of Muslims live there (not saying it's a bad thing, but different to the rest of the country) and it just feels kinda weird
Maybe the north part of Vojvodina, bc its full of Hungarians
Istria is truly beautiful imo
And its really nice that the airport in Pula airport has connections to Zagreb and Belgrade so its easy to get to
Also, you can go to Italy by boat
The Italians there make really good ice cream
It's just plain complicated and stuck in a stalemate
I see what you did there
A lot of them claim to be Italians, but are, lets say, a bit more southern
One of the things i didn't like in Istria, is how open their nationalism is being presented, and how many shop owners are most definitely not Croats, or from countries which Croatia borders
Its cool that i as a Serb can understand newspapers from Croatian minority in Austria that lives there for last 400,500 years
Baka Prase’s endtrack on Voyage
Baka prase and other youtubers
Absolutely hate turbofolk
Please, just ban that shit already
Blamage
That user likes Vesna Pešić
Balkans in general is drowning in reggaeton these days
That and mumble rap/trap or whatever it's called
I moved out this year to live with my girlfriend
I used to bring my girlfriend over and she'd usually stay longer than a week, sometimes a month or two and no one had problem with that
My family loves having her over for as long as possible
Now, I lived with my parents, grandparents and my brother
It's a pretty big 4 bedroom house so there's space
From my experience and what I heard people say, it's better to stay with your parents and not have to pay rent, plus in the future you'd inherit the house anyways
"Bože pravde"
It's mostly praying to God that he leads our country and people, but it's pretty nice song on my opinion
'Bože Pravde' means 'God of justice'
Ours is called "God of Justice" (Боже Правде/Bože Pravde)
I really like it, but it's not that special
Ehh, its not [bad] (shorter version), but i prefer this [one] over it
Melody stolen from Germany/Austria
0/10
Tamo Daleko would be much better
It kinda fits whole country, nice
U boj U boj is a masterpiece, but i don't think it really fits as an anthem tho
I think it's the same in Serbia
Granny Smith and golden delicious, and I don't know the names of the other ones
I live in Australia and literally every house has at least 2 barbeques
I live in Australia and nobody has it
The Serbian word for peanut is "kikiriki" and I always found that super cute
Yes, Voki toki, guess witch word is that
Although i am serbian, serbian is not my first language, so all words sound st least a bit childish to me because of all the č, ć, š sounds combined with k, d, p and other similar sounding letters
I thought all of us slavs had this feature
We can and will do this too, and I love it :) but we also have the opposite, suffixes for making things sound big in a kind of mean way
Janko is a legit common name here lol
What business have you with the Guards of the Crossing
Yeah, it sounds more lord of the rings than the actual job
I noticed that us Slavs tend to overuse the articles, or place them in wrong places
Oh yeah
Of course, i noticed that "the" shouldn't go there
We don't use articles at all, so that's why probably
I consider myself a good english speaker(lol), and i still struggle with articles
While i was in high school i wanted to learn Hungarian, but when i hear it or see it or anything i remember why i gave up without even trying
Honestly my reply was supposed to be sarcastic, it felt natural to put the there
Thanks for the tip fam
Well, it's useful if you want Hungarian passeport, but that's only for Vojvodina
As someone who lives in Eastern Serbia, i don't even know why i even thought about learning it
Imati seks - have sex
Also 'seksati se' - to sex, sexing, but that's not grammatically correct, more like a slang
Oh yes, we have a lot of types of sweets that are based on poppy
My grandma used to make them, and you can buy them in the nearest bakery too
[Makovnjaca] is the most common one, but there's also a kind of [small poppy cakes] or big ones, with different combination of chocolate, vanilla and other stuff with poppy
I don't think people really relate poppy to opium here
In Serbia we also eat poppy seeds, and they are espetially popular in the north of the country (the region which has a lot of indluence from central Europe)
I even ate poppy noodles in kindergarten
Now, concidering growing poppy, from what I'we heard, you need to register with the police if you are planning to grow it, and when harvest comes you have to surrender all poppy shells to them, to be disposed of
(Disclamer: I'm not a lawyer, this is only what I've heard)
And also, I don't think many people here know opium comes from poppy plant
>“polish heroine” called “kompot”
Well ofc I'll be called that
> I don't think people really relate poppy to opium here
like 50+ year old people do, poppy seed tea was popular to "put children to sleep" and farmer did used it to get high
Everybody should try a good makovnjaca, it kicks ass
I'm not sure if it's our local thing
I heard this story too
I wounder if it's actually true or just urban (or rurla) legend
It's Hungarian influence
Yes its true, in my fathers village one woman almost killed her doughter with that tea
Basacly she was asleep for 2/3 days
E) even police was some thimes checking if poppy plants where sliced (you slice them with razor and inhale it to get high)
I want a bowl of mak to eat with a spoon
Only "Black wave" kind if anti government movies in socialist Yougoslavia
>  films are known for their non-traditional approach to film making, their dark humor and their critical examination of the Yugoslav society at the time
>The film makers were linked by a common wish to increase the freedom of artistic expression, and to reform the cinematic language
The filmmakers wanted the right to show the darker side of the human psyche and to openly criticize the policy of the socialist state
This stream gained international attention as well as provoking strong controversies within Yugoslavia
Politically and artistically very important
movement
Yes, but it's not a game
It's called šatrovački and you just flip the word portions (not always syllables)
Similar to other languages, it's thought to have been created by criminals as a way to not be understood by the police
It's used extensively in hip hop
Pretty common in informal speech is to throw in a word or two from time to time, although nobody talks in full sentences
Some people's names in šatrovački become nicknames
Here's a joke about pretending to speak Hungarian for you OP:
*Mi daj šufla seleki
which is just: *Daj mi flašu kisele
("Give me a bottle of sparkling [water]
")*
[Here's] a song fully in šatrovački done by a Croatian band
[Here's] the original
&nbsp;
There's also utrovački where it goes:
*u + second part + za + first part + nje*
*malo ("a little") -> u****lo****za****ma****nje*
Utrovački is not well known
Kaladont, basically you say a word f.e. crvena (red) then the next player must take the last syllable, in this case "NA" and his word must start with that that syllable
You go until there is no word that starts with that syllable, or is ending with f.e. Senka (shadow), then next player says Kaladont, and it's game over for last player
Game goes untill there is only one player left (duh)
EDIT: and also there is this thing, it's not really a game, more like prison language, but is used sometimes as a game, basically u grab a word or name, f.e. Kola (car) u take last syllable, put it in front, in this case it would be laKo, then in front of now first syllable you put letter U, and in front of last syllable you put za, after last syllable you put Nje (ње), so in this case it would be Ulazakonje, it's called utrovachki, it's fun mind gymnastic, for me at least
Similarly we have "šatrovački" and it also reverse the order of syllables
Kuća - Ćaku
Brate - Tebra
This gets used extensively in Belgrade
I hear it everyday
And I have to say, it is a cool thing
Where in Croatia does it get used the most
And do Croats outside of Croatia (Posavina, Hercegovina, etc
) use it as well
Nice to know
Might come in handy next time I'm there
1918 King Alexander ditches the idea of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovene, instead kingdom of Serbia expands only into territories with majority / significant Serbian population
What remains of modern Croatia is ceded to the Italy along with Slovenia, which could probably be divided between Italy and Austria
If this had occurred, rise of fascism in Italy could be avoided, Yugoslavia and all its problems would never exist, Serbia would have to deal only with Macedonian separatist ( maybe partition of Macedonia with Bulgaria would solve that too) and you would have all Serbs living in the single state, opposed to what, 4(5)
Not creating Yugoslavia, instead take the Serbian majority territories as was offered during the war
That would change A LOT of things
The  outcome of the  XIV Congress of the League of communists of Yugoslavia
I wish the Slovenes didn’t leave, I wish the Croats didn’t leave the congress  and the party
The outcome would be that Yugoslavia would stick together and change some economic policies
It would exist still and the bloody ethnic genocidal war would be evaded
I'd like to make Serbia won the Battle of Marica, and it's not only for the sake of Serbia, but for central and Eastern Europe as well
When we lost that battle in XIV century, the Ottomans went through Bulgaria and created chaos in the Balkan states, and Serbia suffered the most
There definitely would be an escalation between us and AH
We had a trade war with them, and both countries in the early 10's were doing military exercises on the Drina border . With the collapse of the Ottomans, there was a huge power vacuum to fill in Balkans, and interests of Serbia and AH couldn't be any more different
What Albanian country
The Austria-Hungary created Albania out of the hidden tribes, in an effort to stop Slavic entry to the Adriatic sea
Saying the spam bots "Kosovo is Serbia" with your only argument of being the London conference is so absurd
Norway's foreign policy, energy policy and economy
Not beeing poor from Switzerland or Norway
Public transport from Switzerland
Other things are pretty good here
About Swiss public transport: Couple of years ago I went to Switzerland to see my uncle,aunt and younger brothers
We decided to go somewhere w public transport and they had these sci-fi looking train/busses which had screens in them,went a million km per hour and I basically couldn't hear them
In Austria I almolst got ran over by one because it went way too fast and were 100% quiet
We don't have motivation for anything, not to plant trees
Of course not
Rakija- people love it, but for me personally it tastes awful
Idk
It’s made of fruit, but i barely can taste it, only the alcohol
Rakija, most common is šljivovica
It's the elixir of youth and it tastes like happiness
Rakija- it tasts like alcohol with some fruit notes
Rakija, the taste depends of which fruit it is made out of
The most wide spread rakija here is šljivovica, plum brandy
sljivovica is a subtype of rakija
Chartreuse is fantastic
it's a group of fruit brandies
Plum rakija -> sljivovica
pear rakija -> kruska/kruskovaca
quince rakija -> dunjevaca
grape rakija -> loza/lozovaca
honey rakija -> mednica/medovaca
etc
etc
Nema na čemu :)
Not really, I kind of picked it up while I was a kid
I was 3 years old when I had a first opportunity to hear it on tv
After that, all the movies and cartoons I watched were on English
So as I grew up my knowledge of it was on the same level as my native language, Serbian
Keep in my mind my childhood was heavily influenced by English, from watching cartoons and movies, speaking to online friends who spoke English as their native language, to reading articles in English
Easiest language to learn considering most media is in that language
Hell no
English is so easy in my opinion, and if you use English on the internet then even the spelling becomes easy
English is super easy to learn, not because it's an easy language, but because of the internet, TV etc
You can learn it simply by watching youtube videos, TV shows, listening to music, playing video games
It's easy because you hear it a lot
I speak French too and it's a billion times harder to learn than English, imo
hit the lawyer, facebook up, delete the gym
Vienna - Beč
Thessaloniki - Solun
I can understand Vienna since it's called the same in hungarian, but why is Thessaloniki different, I don't know
I can assume it has some historical meaning ("so" means salt so for all I know, all salt in old Serbia was imported from one city) but I'm not 100% certain
For 1 RSD you can't really buy anything
For 10 RSD you can buy maybe a few pieces of gum
And for 100 RSD you can buy maybe a bag of chips or like 1-2 liters of drink depending on the brand
1 dinar can buy you maybe a small gum
10 dinars can buy you a small chocho bar ( bananica)
100 dinars can buy you burek or a sandwich
1 RSD - you can't really buy anything
10 RSD - 2 shitty bubble gums
100 RSD - 2 330ml cans of soda
1 dinar: literally nothing
10 dinar: a gum or two
100: some 80g of chocolate, chips, a few bananica etc
1 dinar - absolutely nothing, you get it more as change
10 dinars - two individually wrapped chewing gums
100 dinars - 1
5kg of apples OR a portion of pancakes to go OR a snack (chips for example) and a juice
Yea it do be like that
It's completely changed in Serbian
They translated FUN to "ZeZaNje" - having fun
And then you have
Ze je za zelenu algu na dnu mora (Ze is for the green algae on the sea floor)
Za je za zabavni žur (Za is for the fun party)
Nje je njegova originalna fora, dok pevamo na molu dur
(Nje is his original joke/gag, while we signs in Major scale on the pier)
Basically it's nonsense
I might have gotten something wrong, I don't watch Sponge Bob
Ze je za zelenu algu na dnu mora
Za je za zabavni žur
Nje je njegova originalna fora, dok pevamo na moru dur
Ze is for green algae on the sea floor
Za is for fun party
Nje is his original joke, while we sing major in the sea
F-Fenomenal times you spend with your friends
U-Excitement(Узбуђење)
N-Unforgetable fun(Незаборавна забава)
Yall are weirdoes
Wow samo su ostavili frend
It's fun nonsense though, and it really works in Serbian
SpongeBob is probably the only piece of media ever where I prefer the dub to original
I think the Serbian adaptation of the cartoon is absolutely spot on in all regards
"Ze je za zemljotres što sve ruši"
>(Ze is for the earthquake that destroys everything)
"Za je za zapaliti svet"
>(Za is for burning the world)
"Nje je za koernje sto se sada suši"
>(Nje is for the roots that are drying)
There's also word play in there, "na molu" can be "on the pier" or "instead of a minor scale"
First print, then cursive
For both Cyrillic and Latin
We first learn printed than cursive
I started learning printed letters in kindergarten and cursive in 1st or 2nd grade I think
First printed, then cursive
Then you can choose in which you want to write in
In first grade we learn printed-like letters, but in second grade we learn cursive letters
(In Serbia there are 8 grades)
First cursive then printed-like, but considering that my handwriting is awful you still wouldnt be able to read amything, also even though im 18 i still dont know how to write in cursive latin but can easily in cyrilic
Both, but teachers prefer cursive
And (at least in my school) nobody knows the cursive for Latin after 4th grade, and everyone freaks out when we have to write something in it
Wait, you don't learn printed-like in school
Just go directly to cursive
Oh yeah, essays in Serbian
"-Psst
Dude, how do you write capital L??"
"-I don't know, man, change the word order
Literally, and don't get me started with small k. Thank god after 6th grade we didn't have to write cursive latin again
You didn't? I had to use it all the way through secondary school
I didn't. In 7th grade our new teacher told us we write essays only in cyrillic cursive
Taxi
Literally exact same thing (taxi)
I opened the post to write the same comment when i saw yours
Air port taxi mafia, as we call them, are notorious, but they're not so harsh to locals, i think, only to foreigners or our people who live in the west and come to visit, and who forgot how things function here
So, notion to foreigners landing at Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade - call ''car-go'' service that is something like Serbian uber
If you really have to take a taxi, try going for ones that obviously belong to big companies (usually ''Pink Taxi''), because there are a lot of unlicenced free-lancers who are the worst scammers
Same, made that mistake once
The pizza is actually better in local bakearies
Same, it's important to stay in groups in Florence so they bother you less
Yeah basically, I figured it's not a staple in the north anyways
Had some great pizza in Florence and San Marino (even if it's not Italy)
There’s a (disputed) region that’s the subject of more than enough political memes that comes to mind
Lemme help ya with a couple more: West Serbia being the most primitive because it is too close to Bosnia, most of Sumadija being notoriously drunken to the boots 24/7, exception with Kragujevac which is the higher class than the rest of Sumadijas pesantry, us Esterneers being mostly Vlah people that throw magic on everything and TO THIS DAY live the same way they did 1000y ago, and oh god, people from Vojvodina speaking sloooooooow aaaaaaaaas fuuuuuuuck, so slow that when somebody from Vojvodina tries to ask somebody from south(where they speak fast like hell) how they are, southeneer has enough time to tell them abouth their whole history till this day before the guy from Vojvodina finishes their sentance
There are so much more memes, but these are the first ones that came to my mind
basically, we make fun of each other whenever we have a chance
Sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes
United in hating each other is still united
Excuse me lol
Nah, we got fucked over in Yugoslavia (not even counting the wars), everyone hates each other, especially in Bosnia where it's a three way struggle
Serbia wants to keep Kosovo and to gain Republika Srpska (Serb region of Bosnia) and possibly reunite with Montenegro
No, way too foreign and I don't like some of the laws and how it's organised
That's coming from someone from a not rich country
No, not really
Might have a higher living standard and all that, i have an aunt who lives (pretty well off) in LA, but it's not really for me
What they do to their workers, people in general with healthcare, the amount of crime,homelessness, racial tensions and all that i would prefer going somewhere else if i have to
Sure not all parts of the US are like that and im generalizing but still
I think that would be one of the tax havens of Europe rather than the US
Rich has nothing to do with it
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Countries are far far richer than most countries and i wouldn't move there in 2 lifetimes
You're allowed to have a family there, as opposed to
>and the US is quite friendly towards immigrants overall
Depends which part and which immigrants you're talking about
Fair enough although we have a sizeable diaspora in the UEA which isn't that bad
Me personally, I'd like to study or live there for a year to experience it but that's about it, the US that is
Same, going for a few months to a year would be cool, but staying for longer is a no for me
People do that more often than you think hah
I just can't stand them so i wouldn't even bother working there, maybe as a last resort
Oh, thanks for elaborating
I was thinking in a completely wrong direction, like political or ethnic issues
I'm a man and i know how my mother gave birth to me
Not all the details but most of the stuff
She said it was my duty to know so I can help my wife during and after the birth
It's common around here for women to talk about it, especially among themselves
And every grandmother has an advice or two how to handle the baby
I'd say it's common for women here to talk about it amongst themselves
My mother told me about hers (I'm a woman)
We call that "sarma" in Serbia
Croziflette for life
Montenegro: Crna Gora
Croatia: Hrvatska
Latvia: Letonija (not that different but eh)
Hungary: Mađarska
Germany: Nemačka
Germany:Nemačka
Hungary:Mađarska
I'm not counting slavic countries, since if I did, we would have different names for almost all of them
In norvegian helvete means hell
It sounds
hella cooler than Greece
Yeah, just Engleska
I would say a whole Kosovo cycle of our national poetry about famous battle of Kosovo
It isn't accurate in terms of history but it has a alot of simbols about freedom, heroics, faith and sanctity of these three
Its best encapsulated by these words: "Earthly is a small empire, while heavenly is for ever".
Well, not really a single poem/national epic
Tho we have 5 or so epic cycles of poems dealing with serbian history
However, we do have several patriotic songs I'd concider as "national poems":Vostani Serbije, Onamo 'Namo, Marš na Drinu, Boj na Mišatu, and Gorski Vijenac, tho this one is, let's say contravercial
Here in Balkan there is whole group of "pruve we are original inhabitants" historians
Have you been to the world cup in Russia
It is a big country with great stadiums and everything was organized great, it was 2018 for goodness sake, the cold war is long over
The US got it in 2026 at the same time I believe
Did they buy it too
My point is that Russia deserved to host the tournament and they hosted it amazingly, they have a lot of football fans and their league is always ranked either sixth or seventh in the rankings
Qatar is obviously a disgrace, but even if Russia bought it(which is possible, if not probable) I see no problem with that for the reasons I have already stated
I'm a bit drunk and haven't really had a chance to speak English in quite a while so my point might not be getting acroos, but what I meant is that Russia deserved to host it as much as England or Portugal and Spain for example
Are you sure you aren't just sad that you didn't get to host it
Saying "hand" when I really mean "arm". We have a word for both in Serbian, but we usually use "ruka" for the whole thing
Also saying "fingers" when I really mean "toes". No toes in Serbian, just hand fingers and foot fingers, lol
We say in Serbian: "Ја возим бициклу." Which exactly translated means: "I drive a bike
" But English correct is to be said Ride instead of drive so i get confused about those 2 things
Insulation and isolation
Serbian uses one word for both - izolacija
Probably Saint Sava in Serbia, he is Jesus Christ of Serbian history in terms of popularity and idolization
Sveti Sava
Saint Sava
Started the Serbian Orthodox Church, unified the kingdom
Was an heir to the throne but decided to become a priest instead
Yeah
Every classroom has the picture of him
We have a hymn dedicated to him that the children sing  in school on the Saint Sava day (27th january)
Also Dušan Silni (Dušan the Mighty) is idolized as the pinacle of what a fair, just and strong leader is
There’s a dispute on Vuk Karadžić legacyactually, whether he improved the language or massacred it
Me personallly I find the second point pretty stupid, but nevermind that wasn’t topic
Anyway he isn’t viewed as the saint on the same level as Saint Sava
If you are interested in this topic I recommend you the book ‘Za i protiv Vuka’ by Meša Selimović.
Yeah and built a hospital and few schools so the people can become literate
Yeah, but he actually did some important things in that period of time, while Saint Sava did nothing special except building a couple of monasteries (no disrespect to Sava, he is an important figure for a reason, but I think people idolize him way too much)
I was searching for this comment
Yay
What about the  king Franz Joseph
I see he is the brand there, like in Wien he is everywhere
Or is it just for the tourists
Yeah he simplified the writing so the people can learn to read more easily
Formidable job
Thank you Vuk Karadžić.
Not really, at least from my experience
It’s definetely a thing
But still not that much of people are preaching it, mostly vocal small groups
We do have some flat Earthers and I love laughing at their ingorance on Youtube comment sections
I’d say that the antivaxx crew is the most recognizable here of all anti-intellectuals
It’s a small number again but you indeed find them sometimes
We have other crippling problems than those movements(they don’t have a large presence)
Well
Hard to explain
Yes especially with Croatia for WW2
On a more positive note we have great relations with countries such as Greece and Russia because of WW1

It's full of sour people waiting to attack you for the littlest things
yeah, but sometimes when i read their perspective on things it hurts
i've been online since i can remember, but now the anglosphere is becoming very difficult for me, especially the us part
i find myself violently disagreeing with the premise of life - two party system, capitalist life is shit, and people run to reddit to defend musk and other poor millionaires
yes, this sounds a bit angry, but man we need some other perspective other than 'it's bad to pay taxes and build roads and have healthcare and basic decency'
edit: forgot to shoot my guns in the air
heeyyy 'i took my dog to his forever home' - this sounds like they are going to kill the dog
sure, they keep using it like it's a good thing, but i expect that written on a cemetary gate
yeah, this is the old question about who gets to be european
my langage is half turkish when you look at it - i keep being surprised when i realise some word is actually turkish
If you are good enough to be able to think in English, it sometimes feels like  there is a sub-personality that speaks for you
I think it might be because the way the sentences get to be formed is different then in your mother tongue, it is not exactly what and how you would have said it in your mother tongue, and the whole train of thoughts sort of ends up in a slightly different place
It builds up
I think that Bukovski mentioned something like this in some of his essays (I might be wrong here) and gave the example of forming a sentence where you refer to the white horse: in English, you would said "a WHITE horse - which doesn't leave much space for your mind to wonder
You know that it is white, even before you know that it is a horse
In French, you first found that you are dealing with something that is horse, and so on
I was thinking more on a subtitle differences in a meaning of words and phrases, their places and roles in the sentences
In Hungarian, I sound and feel really deep, formal and serious
In Serbian, it's just a bit higher pitched, more upbeat and fast - energetic somehow
In English, I oscillate between a typical posh valley girl and then slip up and slip into a *istern jurop aksent* occasionally
I become more toxic

Thank you for coming to my ted talk
Davos was pretty cool, but holy fuck was it expensive
But its well connected to Zurich which is well connected to Belgrade so it worked out well for me
> Osijek: Definitely the most east-european looking and feeling city in the country
What
Hah, you guys are amateurs when it comes to eastern-europeanism
I zig-zagged through Slavonia (Osijek-Valpovo-Slatina-Orahovica-Našice-Đakovo) several months ago, and it barely touches the cornerstones of Eastern-European aesthetics
Where are your shitty facades, roadsides infested with weeds, roads infested with semi-patched holes, a single stray dog that somehow strayed from its pack of stray dogs
Everything got a facelift compared to what it looked like ten-fifteen years ago
It's a bit soulless, I admit, but it looks nice
On the other hand, turbo-folk lives on in Slavonia, though, and that's the wild card
Serbia is the closest to EU membership and is the only one viable
People say Montenegro because they're a chapter or few ahead but A) they're using the Euro unilaterally which is actually a big problem B) the most important part is that they've been ruled by the same person for 20 years
If Montenegro in this state becomes an EU member then I seriously wouldn't want Serbia to do so
Here's the thing, I don't see why Serbia would need to recognize Kosovo
The EU certainly can't demand this when it's own member states don't recognise it
The EU only requested normalisation in relations which is a viable thing
Kosovo would stay frozen as it is for the time being
You're also correct that it would be political suicide even to suggest such a thing
>What's the general opinion in serbia regarding EU vs kosovo
Most agree that the EU isn't worth losing Kosovo (or at least losing rights to Kosovo), it's too important to us culturally, historically and not to mention our people and cultural sights are in danger there so it's basically betrayal at that point
>Maybe i'm mistaken but i feel like older people are mostly against the EU since they still look at russia
Actually it's not like that at all
In most EU countries the older generations are right wing here it's basically 50/50 with older and younger people
Here's the general consensus, most would like to join the EU AND keep good relations with Russia
Russia is an important friend to Serbia, maybe more than the EU since they fiercely don't recognise Kosovo, losing such an important ally isn't in our interests
Obviously the Kosovo issue exists (honestly this really doesn't depend on us as the Albanian government isn't implementing anything from the Brussels agreement like the municipality of Serbian territories and is even putting up tarrifs) but there's also the issue of rule of law and various other things
As for Chinese investments, Serbia is in need of them and China is the only one willing to give which always comes at a price
Here's an informative [video] on the subject
I think the EU really needs to cut Serbia some slack, not just promises but something tangible, so Chinese investments will simmer down
>A) not an issue
Actually it's a huge issue
Montenegro needs to either get on the euro standard which it won't or drop the euro for it's own currency
>B) yes, its a problem
Big one at that, I don't see it getting resolved any time soon either since Milo Đukanović completely controls the government not to mention I think in 2010 he was named in the top 10 richest world leaders so he has ties with the mafia
That's not the only problem of course, Montenegro has a problem with the rule of law and new laws such as the government taking church property
>You have one big unresolved border
Normalisation of relations will not cut it
Not much can be expected of us in this matter since the EU itself can't demand recognition for membership
This is the only possible route
>Would be pretty stupid to have a union where a member is not recognized by other members of the union
I doubt you'll going to see it, if at all
Kosovo is dirt poor and sadly run by former terrorists (this isn't me being biased
KLA was designated as a terrorist organisation by even the US and it's chief members are the figureheads of the country) and criminals
The EU is aware of this
>Betrayal by who
Kosovo albanians
No I meant betraying our heritage and our remaining people there
While I agree that it would be smarter for our country to let it go at the same time we're a very proud people with a strong sense of nationality
Letting Kosovo go isn't on the table
>That's true but can it be done
Well that's the question now isn't it
Russia really has no stance on this, in fact I think they'd even like us to join because then they'd have an ally on the inside
A lot of Europeans here think we're some Russian puppet, truth is Russia has done much more for us than the EU ever has + as I said we're very proud and Russia has been our historical ally so we're not so keen on betrayal
If by chance we'd join the Union and benefits from that would start to show, I think people would be more appreciative of the EU and less Russian oriented but I still believe Serbs will always support Russians as a people
Right now we basically don't help out Russia at all, we haven't recongnised sovreingty over Crimea nor are we military aligned with them (or NATO) but we still consider each other best friends
Absolutely
Which is reason why all the bigger countries don't recognize it
All of them have similar situation
Agree
You made it waaaaay more simple than it actually is
It's a very complicated thing
It's like you didn't read my first reply
The same thing happened with Bulgarians and Slavs
I don't like either
If your surname is a little 'weird' and/or doesn't end in -ić, chances are you're from Vojvodina, the northern part of Serbia

Have lived here for 10 years although I lived in Russia for 3 and Austria for 2 earlier
Unless we can somehow pull ourselves out of the economic and political shit hole we are in right now, I don't plan on moving back, however I do visit regularly

There's this video for example that shows everything quite good
Other than that there's touristic Channels that post videos about many stuff
I don't know anything about you but if you've been in a relationship for 10 years with that person it means they are probably worth keeping
Or not, but you need to look into that more than moving back
No country or people are more important than the ones you love
Just my 2 cents
Edit: Yeah **disregard** everything I said there
From UK to Latvia, 30 yearolds with a dead bedroom
Mostly because of the dead bedroom issue, that's a sign she doesn't love you anymore
Sorry mate, you deserve better

We had some great ones - but we also had some serious failures
But the worst for me is “Cipela” (“shoe”) where the guy sings about his shoe going round the world
[Cipela]
For a trash contest - this would be a fine choice, but I do have higher standards and expectations for Eurosong
(And yeah, Croatians having a “Heel” and us having a “Shoe” as our worst choices - just speaks how similar we are, even when making trash music )
I think this is solely for Britain and some of it's former colonies
I live in Australia and it is done here, but not in Serbia
Not the red poppy, but we wear Natalie's ramonda,  which is an endemic species in Serbia and N. Macedonia
The flower is known for being able to be revived by watering it when it becomes completely dry, therefore having a nickname "phoenix flower". That trait symbolises the Serbian Army in WW1 perfectly
We wear a badge on a black-green ribbon around 11th November
We have Natalie's Ramonda
You just spent WW1 selling explosives and cocaine to both side
Yeah, we use them but not poppies
From neutral perspective, Austrians feel much more hot headed and much more proud about their nation, heritage history etc
and overall Austrians are closest Germanic group of peoples to Serbs and other west south Slavs, which is no coincidence considering that a lot of Austrians/Germans lived in these areas and some parts of Serbia were part  Austria for centuries
I didn't know i had an inner Austrian in me
We call it Češka which is basically Czechia
The long name basic conversation is unneeded but honestly I like the way it sounds
In my country we call them "Češka" since forever, and that name is more similar to Czechia than to Czech republic, so I don't really mind the difference
Also, if you watch Eurovision, you'll notice that only they have the word "republic" in their name and it kinda sticks out
We say Češka and it sounds ok, but in english it’s terrible
> češkko
Thats how you say czech in well czech
in serbia we saz Češka (way better then cuechia)
The revolutionary Serbia [boar flag]
[I like our flag from first Serbian uprising]
[Also medieval Serbian kingdom had a nice flag as well]
The 19th/20th century Kingodm of Serbia flag
Either [this one] or the present-day flag
[Kingdom of Serbia (pre WW1 Serbia)] Just looks the best in my opinion
still, it has 2x more details than today's flags
In serbian
Jealosy = Ljubomora (could rougly translate to Love nightmare)
~~Envy = zavistan  it means addicted (like in seanse addicted about what people think that you dont have same things like other persone)~~
I am idiot zavidan is envy
Ljubomora - jealousy
Zavist - envy
They are not used interchangeably
Interesting, because *revnost* here means "zeal, enthusiasm".
>Envy = zavistan it means addicted
Zavistan/zavidan mean envious
Zavisan (without the t) means addicted or dependent
These two words are unrelated
/u/onlyhere4laffs, to answer the second part of your question:
Yeah, jealous gets used instead of envious (not the other way round, though) like in English
sory my brain just trurned of and i mixed up that 2 words
Well there are three countries that share a similar language to ours, many says those are the dialects of the same language
If you take into a consideration all the variations of these three languages, there are a lot of dialects
3 dialects
"Štokavian", "kajkavian" and "čakavian". The difference between them is the way people say the word "what". Basically "what is this" can be said as "šta je ovo", "kaj je ovo" or "ča je ovo". Kajkavian and čakavian are only present in Croatia
Štokavian is then devided in 3 dialects "rkavian" "ikavian" and "ijekavian". Basically how one would pronounce the old letter "yat". So milk would be mleko, mliko and mlijeko respectively
And now all the other dialects are inside these 3 groups
For example, "prizrensko-timočki", "slavonski ekavski", "kosovsko-resavski" and "šumadijsko-vojvođanski" all belog inside ekavian
The difference between kosovsko-resavski and šumadijsko-vojvođanski is that kr would use less grammatical cases and would have stronger ekavian accent (šv: zdraviji, kr: zdravej, translation: healthier, notice e instead of i)
Also the voice "h" does not exist (šv: hleb, kr: leb, translation: bread)
On the other hand šv has system of 4 different accents
So the word could have long rising accent (gláva), long falling (sûnce), short rising (vòda), or short falling (pesma), plus just long accent that only occurs after the base 4 accents (jùnāk)
"Zetsko-južnosandžački" and "istočno-hercegovački" belong inside ijekavian, while "posavski", "young ikavian" and "Istarski ikavian" belong inside ikavian dialect
Official Serbian language is made upon šumadijsko-vojvođanski and istočno-hercegovački
However other dialects are not any less important or "correct" and are still used in parts of Serbia
Europe is not a country so every country inside Europe has it's own "capitals". However, having a look at the Europe as a whole we can find certain capitals of something
For example Paris is a big fashion capital for France, however I'd say Milan is The Capital for European fashion
Similarly we can find a lot of car industries across Europe
Italy and France have their own capitals, but I'd say Germany is a definite Capital of automotive industry
Yet if you live in one country in EU, you can easily work and live in another
So say you're a fashion designer, you can choose between a lot of cities like Milan, Paris or London
Let's see
Serbian, Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Turkish, Russian, German, English, French, Spanish, Italian
So 11 I guess
> Croatian (and Serbian
Then also Slovenian, Bosnian, Montenegrin
and a few others lol
I think you of course count four countries
But I would count 1( serbo-croatian) or two Serbian and Croatian language but I think it is more appropriate to wait for answer from Bosnians and Montenegrins ( did I wrote that one right idk)
Question for croatians:
Do you really in your languages learn it together "hvala lijepa", I mean we to say "hvala lepo" but if somebody would ask me how to say Thank you I would just say "hvala". Lijepa/Lepo means nice(ly) or beautiful(ly)
And from Vranje till Greek border is fala or blagodaram

There was a satirical party Sarmu probo nisi (You didn't try sarma) which was making fun of other candidates
They got 3rd place in presidential elecetions in 2017 (9,44%)

We barely have trains, not some fancy zone in it
All of our trains are completely silent because most of them are not functional or, if they are, they cannot go faster than 50 km/h, so you really do not need a quiet coach
No,there are refuqees everywgere
We have trains but they barely move
Torun is always in my heart, if a Serbian girl can chime in here :)
Its amazing
Vučić Memes are pretty dank too
Marks Square in Venice is breathtaking
Being there after seeing it in history books is an experience in it's own
We went to Venice in highschool too
At that time I was crazy about Corto Maltese in Venice graphic novel, and the city felt like a dream, despite the hoards of tourists
"single day field trip"?
Couldn't even get into Saint Mark's Campanile (the tower) due to the huge amount of Chinese tourists
Granted we did go in spring when it was tourist season
But as you said despite that the city felt like a dream
Yes in Venice, 5 day long in Italy

Well, mostly I am Serbian, but I've got ancestors from Croatia (great-grandmother), and from Bulgaria (great-grandfather)
I don't really speak about this too much, given the fact that these three countries fought a lot in the 20th century
Personally, I am against labels, and I judge a person by the weight of their character, not ethnicity or race, however, there are many people here in Balkans who are the opposite
I speak both Serbian and Croatian, i mean, they are dialects of the same language (Montenegrin and Bosnian is also here in the mix, according to the linguists), and my Bulgarian is bad, but I am practicing it because I have applied for Bulgarian citizenship
If only Mrnjavčević brothers and their armies hadn't been wasted on the eve of the battle of Maritza with the Ottoman Turks, and subsequently slaughtered in their sleep, we could bought ourselves and the rest of the Balkans at least a few decades of freedom, and who knows what would happened next
So there is this one guy
He was returning home from really bad day at eork, and decided to stop and get something to eat
As he is eating and thinking about his day, suddenly the car turns the corner; it's austrian arch Duke
The rest is history
Honestly, that was either greatest coincidence in history or some highter power at work
Night before the battle of Maritza, Serbian army had a feast, got drunk and fell asleep
During the night, ~800 Ottomans sneaked into the camp and slaughtered ~70
000 Serbian soldiers, including our king Vukašin
If this didn’t happen, Serbian army would easily won the battle and would kick Ottomans from the Europe, preventing their campaign in the Middle ages
That wouldn't have saved the Balkans from the Turks
Without a central government to rule over the Serbian states, they were destined to be disunited
This is exactly what the Ottomans exploited in our timeline
A single show of unity wouldn't have given the Balkans enough time to significantly change in a way that would stop the Turks
We used to say *Belgrad* but now we say *Beograd* bcs L for some reason shifted to O. Foreigners however kept this old spelling and name and I honestly prefer it, it sounds better to me
Beograd - White city
Novi Sad - New now
Subotica - Little Saturday
Soko banja - Eagle resort
Sombor - Catfish Pine tree
Wow Irish sounds like what Elves speak in the witcher universe
I think that their language and names are based on Welsh and Irish mythology

Wow yes nigde literally means nowhere in Serbian
People, mostly young ones, from smaller towns and villages come to bigger cities to study, not a whole lot of people leave the urban areas for rural but recently there was some initiation by state to encourage this kind of migration
It's somewhat popular, there is a few clubs all over the country

It has only happened to me when I stayed in Greece
The waitress told us herself that if we can't finish our food, we can ask her and she will wrap it up for us
Based on what I noticed, adults had no trouble finishing their food but kids did and the parents would wrap up their kid's food and take it home with them

> Bigger amount of vegetarians and vegans, also from a young age
well i mean, you did say they love their fries
> Even night clubs had these insane queues where you sometimes had to wait between 15-90 (!) minutes to get in
lolwhat, why don't they go to a different club
In the Balkans hospitality is very important, it's expected of the host to take care of the food and the drinks, so yeah probably a cultural thing
then there's something seriously wrong with nightlife there
Here if there's excess of people wanting to go clubbing, more clubs will open
Never seen lines in front of clubs lasting for longer than 3 minutes here

Our current president exchanged a sandwich and 1000 dinars for a vote
Fuking killed all the competition
Disolved the parlament and gave himself all power while we were a monarchy (mor then once)
Named himself preasident for life during the socialism era
And now we have one entity, who changes bodies every election cycle, but the policies stays the same
Which one
Tito
Nedić (with German help)
, Milošević (although he would usually just imprison people for a bit and mess with the election results)
Vučić?
I wouod vote for the one  one that created four wars, three with our closest neighbors and one with f**ing NATO
All that in ten years
Lol, true :)
Thou I would vote for the one that created four wars three with our closest neighbors and one with f**ing NATO
that one is pretty bad
Yes
First one was actually Milos, he killed most of the opposition voivode, rather silently tho
Milosevic outright murdered his most known critic, Stambolic
Stambolic's murder was creepy as shit
Imagine being put in a meat processing machine
That wasnt Stambolic, Stambolic was killed and buried
There is something I have to ask - considered weird by who
(Whom
) I'm not sure that real grown up people living in reality would judge another person for *eating*. It even makes more sense that you won't cook for yourself, so you would go out to eat
The question is weird for me, since you would be eating at a restaurant, which is the normal thing to do in a very literal sense
You aren't fixing your car in the restaurant, that would be weird, right
If you find yourself asking this kind of question you should move somewhere civilized
Yeah, I wouldn't think a second about it
Nobody cares at all
Bounty hunters are illegal pretty much everywhere except in America
Came for this comment
Anne-Marie, two names or a middle name isn't a thing in Serbia
~~Tmi, my dad and brother are both Lászlós, actually
&#x200B;
And my goodness, do I simply love old stereotypical High Germanic sounding names like Ulrika, Hildegard, Astrid, Sigismund, Valdemar, Wilhelmine, Brunhilde - spliced in with the occasional Latin ones like Ursula, Glorianna, Octavia, Beatrix and so on and so forth
Don't even care if they sound pretentious or wildly outdated
I just adore them for their old-timey poshness
But, if I had to chose just one, I'd definitely go with Libushe for sure, the mythical founder and first queen of Prague, since I'm partially Czech myself
It's just so close to my heart
Luckily, my family has a tradition of interesting names, so, it wouldn't be entirely far-fetched for us when you think about it
Would probably cause quite a few raised eyebrows where I'm from, though
So, feelings are conflicted
I have a friend from mixed German-Serbian-Hungarian-Slovak background
He has hungarian name, his sister has German and his brother Slavic name
Just another regular family in my region
pretty sure there is "Ana Marija"
Stalin's brother in law, Alexander Svanidze (Александр Сванидзе) ? He was Georgian though
If there is I've never met anyone with it, glad to be wrong if true though
Serbians and Croatians have different names mostly, I'm not surprised it's a thing in Croatia although some here say it's a thing in Serbia too although I've never heard of anyone with that name
I'm aware, I first found out about it through a Portuguese girl
I think it sounds really nice
I don't think that's considered a middle name in the same sense as in some western countries, hence why I didn't mention it
Aljoša is a name in Serbian though for instance
We also have Aleksa which is also a male name but might not be perceived as such anymore (thx Amazon)
Neither of them are nicknames for Aleksandar
I personally hate clothes with logos because I find them lazy style and hella stupid
It's just a way to show off you got money which I find superficial
I avoid them like the plague lol
I've noticed that those who wear clothes with logos are those who try to imitate the current american hip hop style in which the dudes try to flex their money
These people are not what i'd call well-dressed
They look ridiculous most of the times and they aren't taken seriously by the general population anyway
France
I used to romanticize France, learn french, watch french movies and listen to french music
until I visited Paris
Don't get me wrong
It was a pretty city but what I saw and experienced was far from what I've seen in the movies and various photos and posts
First of all, it was very dirty, less impressive than I thought it would be and way too dangerous for me to enjoy my trip there
My  balkan country is far safer to walk around at night than Paris
Not going back anytime soon
Im pretty sure its the norm in most of Europe
Yeah
I don't think I've encountered a shared washing machine in my life
I think there might be shared machines in student dorms or something, since it doesn't make sense to have 1 machine per person
Serbian- originally it was your father's name then Vic on the end, when this stopped you kept the last name as your father so if you were the child of the first generation after it stopped it would be your grandfather's name then Vic, next generation your great grandfathers and its continued like that until now
>Serbian -ović
Doesn't necessarily have to have an O. For example  a common surname is  Milošević (I know there was one major famous idiot with it as a last name)
arent thous more serbian
Also, it doesn't have to have -ić at all
Serbian last names in Vojvodina (northern Serbia) often end with -ev, -ov, -ski, -in
Well, those are all common Slavic possessive suffixes, so it figures that you have them in many surnames from Slavic countries
I mean, you have them in Russia or Ukraine too, they're all over
(Edit: koliko znam, takve nastavke imaju samo Srbi iz Vojvodine
Naravno, u Vojvodini imaš i drugih naroda sa prezimenima sa takvim završecima, ali Makedonaca def ne baš mnogo)
Well i don't really mind i don't need English to understand Croats and Bosnians maybe Macedonians but for everyone else English is a good neutral language with which we can all communicate, plus i like English language, it's one  beautiful bastard tongue which makes it perfect to be our universal language
Yes a bit because it is so so so complicated and has no rules at all
I had similar problem
When I was in Prague few months ago, people woučd automatically switch to English
It came to the point where I had to tell one girl: "why are you sabotaging my efforts to learn your language
I think my Czech improved after that
Am I the only one who thinks the opposite
Native English speakers will have a harder time learning another language than someone else learning English

Hungary - nah, we're cool
We had a lot of historical beef, but now we are good
Romania - tbf probably our best neighbour
We aren't culturally as similar as other EX-YU countries (obviously), but we didn't have any conflicts historically and I don't think we will in the near future
Bulgaria - Same as Hungary, just maybe a little bit closer culturally
North Macedonia - country that we are mostly cool with from EX-YU ones (along with Slovenia) and they have their own stuff going with Albania and Bulgaria
Albania - Well obviously we have a lot of disputes with albanians (mostly Kosovo ones), but as a country I don't think they intend to fight us, neither do we (unless some crazy sh*t happens on Kosovo)
Montenegro - People of the two are very close and hostile towards each other (mostly), but our goverments are not in good shapes lately and montenegrin politicians intend to make their own orthodox church, which is obviously not a good sign for our people there
However, in the near future I think our goverments will match each other as well as people do (also depends on which person do people elect as a president)
Bosnia and Herzegovina - This is the one I'm most worried about
We quite recentelly fought during the breakup of Yugoslavia (which is multicultural federation in most of it's existence) and today's Bosnia and Herzegovina is very similar to that model, consisting of three constituous groups that (almost) hate each other
Some things will happen there for sure, but I can't predict whether it will be a war or just a smaller conflict
Croatia - We can't admit we are very similar to each other and that's our main problem
After the war, Croatia clearly "said" that they don't want to do anything with us in the future, we did the same and we just kept the distance since then
I don't think there will be a war between us as long as we aren't being too close, because Yugoslavia proved that that's not possible (as of now)
So, yeah, BiH is a site with the highest risk of war happening (not counting Kosovo), followed by Albania and Croatia
I can't imagine us fighting with others
Good to know that we aren't the only ones
If war ever breaks out in the balkans again it will be because Serbia is never satisfied with what it has
Our tendencies toward Serb Republic in Bosnia aren't even a secret
Yeah, unfortunately I never visited Bucharest, but I imagine the two are very similar
I heard people call Bucharest "a little Paris", which probably means arhitecturally is very stylish
It is very high on my wishlist
However, I've been to Timisoara and it is very similar to most of big cities in Vojvodina (f.e. Novi Sad)
I think this "status qvo" will remain for a while simply because both of the sides won't give up on the land
According to my country's law it is
I think there is a bigger chance of civil war happening in BiH than international one, but as for Kosovo it could be very bloody and probably all big players would "pick sides" (f.e. US would probably support Kosovo and Russia would support Serbia)
There will be minor conflicts for sure, but I don't think  major things will happen
It is of great importance for both serbs (historically) and albanians (politically), but I think enough sh*t happened in the last 30 years and both of the sides aren't keen on battling anymore (atleast not as a war)
There are like 30 or so languages spoken in the north of Serbia, 3 of them (Hungarian, Slovak and Ruthenian) are cooficial with Serbian
Other than Serbian, I speak Hungarian pretty much fluently
The northern province of Serbia, Vojvodina is really diverse with 6 official languages (Serbian, Croatian, Hungarian, Slovakian, Romanian and Rusyn)
The last one being a really interesting case, since Rusyn, not to be confused with Russian, is only spoken in Vojvodina and a few municipalities across the border
Being from the northern part of Serbia (Vojvodina), can confirm I can swear in Hungarian, Slovak and Ruthenian, as well as in Serbian
The only way we'll get Kosovo back is if all Albanians decide to move
That being said that doesn't mean we shouldn't stop fighting to preserve our cultural heritage and rights for our people there
First half of 18th century would be an interesting thing to see
At that time we had a lot of uprises against the Ottoman empire, and people were wearing some cool outfits if you ask me
No, it’s New Year’s tradition
Christmas tradition is Нож
Is there a traditional Christmas/New Year movie then
Ironiya sudby maybe
Dizelaši - during the 90s though
Klošar is nowadays a popular term for people who are trashy and chav-ish
We have klošare
Usually similar to gopniks they are poorly dressed very rude people
[Dizelaši] \- in fact, their streetwise, urbane aesthetic became so prominent all throughout the 90s that to this very day a lot of men here, conciously or not, still prefer the short-to-bald buzzcut hairstyle and the sportsy-dressing look
Eh for a redneck type of thing a seljačina would be a better equivalent , and we also do have džibere as well
Sometimes but the urban meaning is usually very similar to gopnik
Yeah, this is fucking weird stuff
I met a kid once, son of some uni profesor from Zagreb, and the kid recited some of this stuff to me here in Belgrade
I felt sad
Yeah, I see a lot of that now here in kids who are maybe 16-20 years old, and I hope the young young kids somehow avoid the generation of shit and idiocy
I know :( I guess for them it will be more of the same plus this resurgence of show-off religious crap
Here you can see people who notice a church, or a part of a church, or a pixel, and they cross themselves
I was stunned when I saw this the first time, but now it's almost normal
Insane people
Croatian: Almost 100%, maybe there's a small chance I won't understand a word, but probably not, it's like a British person speaking to an American
Macedonian: around 50-56%? If I really focus, I can even hold a conversation
Slovene: about 30-40%, I can understand basic sentences, but in general, not intelligible
Polish: 30% at best, it's much different from Serbian with all those long words that sound pretty hard to say
Czech, Slovak: 35-40%, sounds like Serbian, but simplified to the level I cannot understand it anymore
Bulgarian: 20-35%, people speak very fast so it's hard to understand but I could understand if they spoke with very basic words and sentences
Russian: 20-32%, same as Bulgarian, some of the words straight up sound like Serbian words but shortened and said fast, probably couldnt hold a conversation
Ukrainan: 10-15%, sounds like a harder version of Russian, it's kinda strong and fast, it sounds like a mix between Polish and Russian
*Croatian Bosnian Montenegrin*
Why are these even distinct languages
The same thing as Serbian,but with 10-30 different words and same letters
*Check,Slovakian*
Not too much,but some words yes
Different spelling and words make it difficult
*Russian*
Pretty much yes,but There are some words that sound unlike anything I've ever heard before
*Slovenian*
I know Austrian and Serbian,so Slovenian is pretty easy
*N.Macedonian(sorry)*
Here and there
Some words are same as Serbian, familiar currency (Dinar and Denar),but some words are more like Bulgarian
*Bulgarian*
In a word:No
In a sentence:Very few familiar words,so its kinda hard
*Ukrainian,Belorussian*
Almolst the same applies as with Russian
(Not counting Croatian and Bosnian)
I'll make a little ranking:
Macedonian
Slovenian
Bulgarian
Russian
Other Slavic languages, except Polish
Polish
Generally Slavic languages are pretty similar; most of the time, if you both try hard enough, 2 Slavs can hold a conversation in their languages
I can completely understand Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin
Of course, there might be some words I wouldn't understand due to a regional/country dialect
I would definitely be able to hold a conversation comfortably
Though, I can't say the same for Slovenian, Bulgarian and Macedonian
However, if they speak slowly, I might be able to understand around 60 or 70%. I'd really have to make an effort to speak those languages
When it comes to Polish, Slovak, Czech and Russian, I can understand certain words and simple phrases but I wouldn't be able to converse
I can understand all South Slavic languages like they're my native language
Other slavic languages, not so well
Same except I understand Polish because of my Polish mum
When it comes to Slovak, last Summer I was on a cruise and there were two Slovak tourists with their guide telling them about the sights
I understood everything without knowing the words, it was a really strange experience
Pa ovo prvo jer je isti jezik nznzm sto izdvajao, pa desi se da ne razumes neku rec kad ti prica neko iz sandzaka ako si sa severa
We use it the same way here
Shtokavian/ neo Shtokavian would be really legitimate name since its neutral
a i to sto kazes
Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin are all the same language (usually reffered to as Serbo-Croatian), just different dialects
I didn't write Montenegrin because not even most people in Montenegro claim to speak it
mass genocide
Black Hand Assassination Hit Squad
My school had a Hungarian class (I'm from Vojvodina) and Serbian classes
It worked well, they just had class in their own language and that's about it
Although sometimes I worry about how well some rural Hungarians who come to my city will speak Serbian because of that reason
I believe there are also schools which have classes in Slovak/Rusyn/Romanian etc
and in the south classes in Albanian
I don’t want to talk about it
Do i need to answer that
No, no
*Pretends to ignore Kosovo*
We had Kosovo, and they had their way and are independent
I'm not really sure that they are better like that but that's a closed chapter
Also you can hear some rumblings about Vojvodina independence or joining Hungary, but those are mostly ignored
There is no really serious independence movement
Well
now that you mention it
Do I actually need to write anything,or does everyone already know
Again
Thw word for handgun is "Pištolj" and the word for revolver is well "revolver"
And another example car is "auto"
North Pole or South Pole and Gender - Пол, Pol
We also use same word for Shotgun and gun -
Puška, пушка
Same here
Playing video games, tinkering with broken electronics, watching cartoons and TV shows, building LEGO structures, playing basketball
I still do all those things now, only I'm taller than I was when I started
Numismatistical, ventriliquistish, Ghastists
That's all that comes to mind
We're landlocked but I also have to go with Portugal
The people seem to have similar sensibilities and the cities, but mostly small towns, feel strangely familiar
Inland it's even more similar, it's almost uncanny
I love the place honestly
Also, Ante [Pavelić] was hiding there for a long time and also buried there
Wow, interesting
I never noticed how similar they sound but yeah, you're completely right, it's almost uncanny
> In 1996, he was photographed posing at the grave of former Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić in Madrid
Ustaše had sought the advancement of an ethnically “pure” Croatia, collaborating with the Nazis in the persecution and killing of minority ethnic groups
Šuker’s response to the photos, as reported in The Guardian, was telling
“It is well known what Davor Šuker stands for,” he said, referring to himself in third person, as he often does
> Šuker’s support of the defender Josip Simunić has also generated outrage
The former Croatia international, who helped fund a 2016 film alleging that the Croatian holocaust was exaggerated, was banned for 10 games in 2013 after engaging in nationalistic chanting after a World-Cup playoff game against Iceland
Šuker, who by then had been elected as chief of the country’s footballing federation, saw fit to appoint him as a coach for the national team
Yikes
We used webex cause the email invitation is rather simple to use
None, I don't have it mostly
And when I do, I just skip it
But it's Zoom
Besna Kobila (mountain) = angry mare
Srpska Crnja (town) = Serbian black (person, but could also be interpreted as
Babin Zub (mountain) = grandma's tooth
Srpska Crnja (Српска Црња) - means Serbian ni*ga
That one was so bad it's almost cheating
In our country religion is still a big part of our lives
So I can easily say that we don't become religious all of a sudden
We are religous through out whole life
It's not uncommon to see people fasten for 40 days before Christmas, or every Wednesday and Friday
They don't have a reaction, never heard of Serbia
... They don't say anything out of politeness plus they don't know of it much
Great of course
You mean Siberia/Syria
I would tell them no Serbia and then the blank stare would come
Belgrade, no snow yet
I think this is the first winter since measurments began without snow
We did have snow fall, but everything would melt instantly so it was basically like rain
In Belgrade we had snow for a day but it melted instantly when touching the ground
Each year there is less snow, but this is the first time I've ever seen a winter with no snow at all
In yyeeaarrss not a single snow flake
I live in northern Serbia(Novi Sad,Vojvodina)
In Southern Serbia,Zlatibor is covered in snow 24/7
French and Greek
Polish is a really sexy language in my view, and imagining how its written makes me feel even better (don't know if many others would agree considering how fucked up the orthography and how hard the language itself is), but yeah, I actually love that
I might have a bias though since I'm Slavic
French and Italian
I also like Spanish and Portuguese
I'm not sure about that but I know that we Serbs take pride in having domestic monarchies ruling over us during the period where having germanic monarchy was  the trend in Europe
I really want to believe they're not still sore over that war
Well 6th is cristams eve so yes, but not for same raasone as you
Well it is Christmas Eve in Serbia, so yes we do celebrate
For christsamas eve you fast, you have few types of fasting, most people do "easyest" witch just forbide you eating animal products (but you can eat fish and honey)
But there is also, fasting "on wather" you eat only what can be pepaird in wather (so just boiling food and no frying), And think some monks dont eat anything other then bread and wather
Well also burn oak branches (old pagan tradition)
on Christams day we make special food [česnica] you put gold coin (well today just regular one) and who gets it in his slice he will have forntune that year
And there are alot more traditions but they are more limited to some parts of serbia, so not all people do them
Talk about wars
Wow so many rules all over the place, it is hard to keep track of it
I don't have any suggestions for my country
You can be polite and say "thank you", but it is also ok not to
You can have stereotypes and ask about them or you can skip them
We have nice people that will ignore everything, but also angry people that will get angry for saying "excuse me". You can cross the red light or not, it all good
Skip the line if you don't want to wait, it's ok
What will make someone love you will really trigger someone else
No rules, sorry
I remember my friend during our school trip btought a flag with him and thought it would be cool to take a pic with it in front of Hitlers home
He got fined and lectured by a policemen for doing that
Well it is considered some sort of higher end brand, but in general you get what you pay for
Here, we don't really have many high quality furniture brands so we can say IKEA is one of the best out there
It doesn't have a bad name unlike in some other countries
I have a pretty positive experience with them, I have a chair from them (it costed around $140) and the build is just excellent
The armrest and other parts are literally built from some kind of METAL
If you bought a chair for a similar price from a local company the chair parts would be most likely plastic
Also their support is also amazing
That Swedish store that offers high quality furniture
Relatable McDonald's experience
In Serbia, it was seen as a cool place to take your kids to, while in the US it's a sketchy place taken over by hobos
No one thinks it's healthy food, it's more about the status thing
Don't mention Kosovo
or any war that happened on Balkans
or anything about Balkans
there is guaranteed war in the comments in the next 24 hours
this describes the balkans as whole very well lmao
We're just a big cultural mess
Croatian guy is right,just dont mention war
Yup, at least we all agree on that
Joker sucked, while we're at it
[some people were not happy about this map i made]
So Iberia and some of the baltics/finland/scandinavia and russia arent Europe
I know that's why I'm mentioning it
Any post including word Kosovo will start a war between Serbs and Albanians
Also yes
Косово је Србија
totally agree, minus the enjoyment part
Bored me to death
But that's subjective at least
it's a joke map
They didnt follow either the catholic or easterm orthodox churches
I haven't, though I do plan on it for about a month
Ill def check it out soon
West Bulgaria
You mean Hong Kong
Definitely not a fan considering nobody asked us to put one there
It would be fine if US troops were held accountable for their actions
But of course, they rarely are
I'm much more interested in getting the Gladio blacksites out of Europe
Sweden
They went from pagan vikings to christian fanatics to secular social democracy in about 800 years
Russia, from underdogs to the biggest country on earth
I'm a bit biased but it's my own country and people's history then it would be: in medieval and modern era Germany, Russia and France
In ancient world: ancient Greece and Roman empire specifically Roman republic
We are sort of obsessed with Irish bars in the former Yugoslav state, you can find a bunch of them in every capital city
Definetly to the 1970ies, the golden ages of Yugoslavia
I know, by memory or *almost* by memory, the English, French, German, Italian, Croatian, Serbian, Yugoslav, Polish, Russian, Soviet, Chinese, American and Canadian anthems aaand I think that's about it
I used to have an obsession with national anthems
Not so much anymore, but I still love the Italian anthem (the most beautiful in the world to me), and the French and Chinese anthems are very powerful to me too
Besides ours, I know the words of Croatian and Montenegrin anthems and the melody of French, Italian, German, Russian and Polish anthems
I know the old Yugoslav ones and few second Serbian ones
Clothes
They're usualy mega cancerous and try not to go near them(they still dab)
I don't think we have rich people here
Apparently Državni Posao(state job)
It is on air since 2012 at it has 1566 episodes
It is a comedy btw
How popular/loved is Malenczuk in Poland really
I still don't know the language that well to catch stuff like that, I can only see that he has a lot of views on youtube
I find him really charismatic, and i love his voice, but i understand he's somehow controversial
Czy nie
Yes
Torlački, can’t understand a word when the talk to each other
Oh that's really interesting
People living in the far eastern parts of Serbia speak way faster than in the north
I have family from a village near Dimitrovgrad and they use some Bulgarian words too
I'm interested in how the Bulgarian close to Serbia sounds to you
I live in south-eastern Serbia and it used to snow much more like 10 years ago
Now it usually snows only few times per winter and it melts pretty fast
I live in eastern Serbia and I remember there was a lot of snow back when I was a kid (2000s and early 2010) starting from December and sometimes up until mid April
Last year, there were like 2 days of snow in January I think which was like 2 inches and that’s about it
It’s snowing less and less every year now but around 8 years ago it was a lot more
Not to mention the winters are getting warmer, before it would go as low as -20 celsius during winter, last year there were just a few days where temperatures were a bit lower than 0, it was mostly around 3 or 5 celsius
Climate change is definitely real
1783,34
thousands, millions etc don't have separators, even tho sometimes a space is used, while decimals are separated by commas
People here don’t even know that atheists exist
Being an orthodox christian is a norm
My friend from uni knows i’m an atheist, but still, she presumed that i believe in afterlife, i cite her ‘i mean you do believe there is something after death right, like everyone does’ . No, I don’t. I don’t believe
I am an atheist
The most far people go is ‘agnosticism’ . That’s gen Z mostly and gen X, boomers can be atheist since many of them were communist
Edit: 85% of Serb citizens view themselves as orthodox christians
Really depends
Accepted but you what I've realised is that heavily criticising religions is seen as rather rude
If you're atheist you should probably keep it to yourself
Absolutely nothing bad would happen since there's thousands of atheists but it's seen as rude at least among the faithful who are in a majority and likely your family members to openly bash Christianity
I'd stay saying your Christian as a young person is more surprising than saying you're an atheist
atheists are usually not patriotic, hate that they are serbs and are probably from belgrade
It's not so strong here because most of the older people remember communism and Tito with fondness
And judging by their words it was not desirable to be a religious person in Communist Yugoslavia
There is a resurgence of Ortodox church and religion in the last decade, but I think most of those people are cultural Ortodox
The don't believe in God, they just like the traditions that are big part of Serbian culture
I think our current president is not religious but he pays a lip service to the church when it's beneficial to him
You don't see religion mentioned in political discussions or during the elections
Most of the younger crowds don't belive in God
Although I have two friends who are religious and LGBT
I don't know how that works for them but in their company I make a conscious decision not to talk about religion
Most of people here are behaving like atheists
I'm orthodox christian and I know that majority of people in Serbia don't fast when it's supposed to, or don't go to church as many times as they should
If you ask them, they'd say they are christians, but they don't really respect the most of christian values and customs
Atheists are not that common thing here, but they are seen as regular, normal people
I think it's more about the customs than than the religion itself
Most of the people like the customs or observe them because it's proper or because it's something that their parents taught them to do
As from my experience with traveling through BiH - true, wherever you are
The only thing that makes difference- is religion itself changes from A to B to C.
Well, being pro-church was rebelious back then in the 80s-90s. Gen X was provoking their boomer parents
Also, after the overthrow of communism, the predominant ideology became pro-religious, and supports all orthodox christian practices (i’m neutral about that)
The new regime added the study of religion as a subject in both elementary and high schools, and intesified the praise of Saint Sava (our most praised and glorified saint)
So when kids study that in school, they accept it, because they see their teachers as the authoritative sources of knowledge
That’s why zoomers don’t question religion
Their parents became religious, so their parents AND the school system don’t question religion, precisely orthodox christianity
I don’t really care about them, but it is how i said
No while not repressed, it was most definitely frowned upon especially if you were a member of the Communist party, relatively common if you hoped to have any kind of career
We call him [Pičkousti (Pussylips)]
His most popular phrases: 'Silence over there
' and 'Let me ask you something instead'.
We call him "pussymouth" (rough translation lol)
If you see him, you know
Budimpešta [Будимпешта]
Budimpeshta, the 'sh' makes a "š" sound
We say "Budimpešta" as in "Budimpeshta". So to answer your question - with the "sh" sound
When it comes to English, I always say Budapest with S. However in my language it would be Budimpešta, which has SH sound instead
In Serbia they're usually armed with just a pistol but if there is a large football game they are equipped with riot gear
Every single policeman gor a handgun in their holster in Serbia
Nonexistent, dont remember seeing any cycling infrastructure
Here in Serbia you just pray not to get hit by a car
Oh we have fake cycling lanes
So it's shit
We don't have family gathering
We visit each other often but we never make it an event
Numbers have genders and can be declined through grammatical cases
But not all numbers have gender, only one (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two (just m and f)
And only numbers up to 4 can be declined
Why
Nobody knows
And if you count anything anything above 5, the word changes its ending
Jedan slon - one elephant
Dva, tri, četiri slona - two, three, four elephants
Pet, šest
slonova - five, six
elephants
Also women's surname do not decline through grammatical cases
Unless you make them a man's property
Jovanović - just a surname
Jovanovićeva - who is meried to Jovanović
Jovanovićka - whose father is Jovanović
And only then are they declined
*Disclaimer: in modern language, those two are not defined as anybody's property
Most people do not even know the difference
The only reason why the endings stayed is because feminine nouns can't decline if they don't end with "a"*
Gore gore gore gore
Means: Up there the mountains burn worse
Understandable
In Serbian casual speech it would be something like Tata, jesi to ti tu
Since I started using English excessively, going back to my mother tongue feels like stepping from a simple one plus two to incomprehensible equations that solves problems of gravity and mass at superluminal speeds
English is a blunt instrument, like a hammer, while my mother tongue is a thousand scalpels control by alien AI
Have to agree with the emotional part
I find it much easier to talk about my emotions in English, I can't do it in my native language without cringing
But I find Serbian better for some other things, like swearing, direct commands, telling anecdotes
From Bosnia:
Muslims asked Hodza (priest) to explain the difference between dictatorship and a democracy
"Dictatorship is when I climd the minaret (the mosque tower from where priests call people to prayer) and piss on you from abowe
And the democracy is when I climb the minater and piss on you from above "
"So what's the difference
"In democracy, you can freely piss on me
Positive, one of our few reliable and liked neighbors
Really good people besides Greeks our only true friends, interesting fact they are only country that we border that we've never been to war with
From Serbia, we call you our orthodox brothers sometimes
And we enevy you because we see how you are handling your government and we wish we could do the same
Also your living standard has climbed dramatically and surpassed ours sometimes ago
Some of the people still remember the times when we were ahead
Your pop dance music has a lot of listeners here
People like going to Timisoara, although the malls are a bit pricier than here
Very good, actually the best neighbors
Our best neighbours, orthodox brothers
Also it's cool how they don't recognize Kosovo
I didn't realise so many people here are so racist towards Gypsies, holy shit
Great people, beautiful nature, and best neighbours by far
Positively - the  Ceaușescu solution is often brought up when people try to figure out what to do with our politicians
I often hear about a lady judge that rules with an iron hammer and many wish we could borrow her for a month or so
Colorful graveyards are seen as cool and exotic
Can confirm
People speak from experience and almost anyone who has meet gypsies either has themselves had a bad experience or knows someone who has
Could be battle of Rovin 1396 when king Marko Mrnjavcevic fought on Turkish side as vassal against Vallachia he died in same battle,he is also considered biggest hero in our Epics and in reality he was just Turkish vassal
Romania, not us
But yes, even the US
You still have checks and balances even if Donald is ripping everything apart
The courts still can countrol the president
We have a sham here
The president has all the power
Whatever he wants he gets
The courts are independent but only in theory
The parliament is made up from the ruling party and it doesn't work
Opposition is steamroled and ignored
And even that opposition is made up from people who are like president
They were in power before and nothing was different
Well if a majority of encounters people have with gypsies is negative can you really blame them for mistrusting and disliking that people group
Well his father kinda doomed whole Balkans so that was the only thing he could do and save some of his dignity
I wasn't even talking about Romania or Romanians at all, I'm not sure what the point of this is
Here they mostly live in slums and poverty and they prefer it that way
The person who I was responding to didn't even mention Romania what are you on about
I never even mentioned Romania I was just taking about gypsies
Quit putting words in my mouth and embarrassing yourself
[Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary] in Kragujevac
[The Name of Mary Church] better known as the cathedral by locals even though it's not an actual cathedral
It's a roman Catholic church destroyed in 1884 revolutions and has since been completely rebuilt
It's the most recognisable building that's in the city
The most recognisable building however and the one the city is most know for is the
[clock] on the Petrovaradin Fortress
It's featured in all the touristy magnets
[Treaty of Pozarevac/Passarowitz was signed in my city in 1718]
You should visit us sometimes
I think the German word for border "grenzen" comes from some Slavic language
You would be surprised how many words we have in common
-25M here
-Fresh from university (MSc civil Eng
-On my first job (relevant trainee civil eng
ie job in my field of education)
-Unmarried
-Living in the capital city of Serbia
-I don't rent (I own a small studio flat, no debt on it)
**I can manage to save around 200~300€/m** with just a little help from my parents (providing local food one or two times a month that can cover up to one week of food expences)
In conclusion I may not be the best example, but I could say with considerable certainty (also knowing some of my colleagues renting situations) that **majority cannot save more than 100~150€/m, and a lot of people saves nothing
This can vary considering ones lifestyle, saving strategies & discipline and location & number of roommates (ie overall price for renting)
In my opinion, salary is not that significant factor because knowing the market here & if we calculate only **entry level** engineering positions (IT excluded), that small difference wouldn't considerably (non)contribute to savings
Nothing except the change of the language for the worse, I guess
Edit: well now that I think about that, maybe our agriculture will get fucked up, as all the people on the north are farmers, nad those on the south are stockmen
Albanians on the north, Serbs and some Hungarians on the south
It would be a pretty confusing and "How did this even happen" situation
We would have Albanians in our capital but at least Kosovo would truly be Serbia
Ahahahah umirem
Kosovo up Vojvodina down
Yeah but we're not talking what if locations switched place, only if people did
Number of people that smoke and that smoking is allowed indoors, in restaurants and cafes
Same here
I was about to write the same
I took my South African boyfriend to Belgrade last year and he couldn't believe it
It's also the reason why I pick up smoking again whenever I go visit my family
It would feel weird not to smoke
>Vast majority of people are atheist/agnostic and religious people are seen as goofies
Sounds like paradise
I felt as if I returned to a home I never knew
I guess it shocks other normal foreigners :)
I think this is universally a Slavic thing
We don't really smile much (unless there's a good reason for it)
Well they really made me wonder, now I have to go see the rest of Germany :) I know I'll go back to Berlin but hey
Honestly in Serbian it would be impossible to have spelling bee, because every word is written exactly how it is spoken
Every letter match the certain sound
I've heard of that, but we have no such thing
Simply, or language is like Spanish for example
However, it's the only (European) language that is 100% phonetic alongside Macedonian
Meaning we have 30 different voices and 30 respective graphemes, without exceptions
Even loan words or names are transcribed
Washington - Вашингтон (Vašington), randezvous - рандеву (randevu), xylophone - ксилофон (ksilofon)
And as you can see, it's the only (European) language that has two official alphabets
However Latin alphabet isn't 100% phonetic, because it has a few digraphs lj - љ, nj - њ, dž - џ.
99% correct; just:
Each sound has its exact letter;
Some letters can have more than one sound;
But that still makes any chance of some spelling competition- impossible; or everyone a winner
(Na srpskom: “baNka” i “Nikola” su različiti glasovi za N, banka je nazalno; ali i dalje imamo ono što amer nema)
Didn’t you guys have had one spelling till 1989 and another afterwards
(I started learning French in 1990, mais j’ai oublié quelques chose
Absolutely, women are especially pressured to have kids before they're in their late 30s
I'm from one of the smaller countries, so "Hey, we're going to Timisoara (Romania), we will be back by lunch" is not unusual thing to hear
Once, my dad and I were in Greece, decided to do a road trip through Albania, visited a lot of places and went to my grandma's place in Montenegro all in one day
It's kinda easy to visit a lot of countries in a short amount of time, especially by car but because everything is kinda close, I never had a chance to travel by plane
Areas in Belgrade in Serbia built in socialist times are a much better place to live now than the pre-socialist parts of the city mostly because of green spaces, much more space between buildigns etc
Korinđanje - in Serbia or atleast in the Banat region, this used to be like our own halloween
Kids would go door to door and sing a song or a poem and then people would give them candy for it
It depends, here on Balkans changes were so constant one simply can't choose one for all periods
I would say
[Rasti, rasti] - medival Serbia
[Ajde Jano] - 18-19 century Serbia (although I prefer Nigel Kennedy and Kroke Band interpretation, this one is more "natural".
[Drina March] - 20th century
and unfortunately, probably some turbo-folk shit like this [trash] the '90s.
And another one from, let's say Yugoslavia
>Norwegian Wood
[Hvis lyset tar oss]
Belgrade means White City, and, well
it's not white at all
I don't think it's even at all
For me there's a world difference from Warsaw to Gdansk or Torun
I'm not Polish so I can't say what feels more 'domestic' to you, but Warsaw had a distinct eastern/middle Europe feel to it, and cities like Gdansk obviously feel and look much more like western/northern Europe
Anyhow, I find Poland in whole exceptionally lovely
No, it’s hard to learn, we have  cases, weird accentuation rules etc
Let it be french
It’s not that hard believe me, it’s easier than fucking english
Nah, we are adopting Montenegrin standard
I mostly use Cyrillic but when I am on the computer i use Latin
Cyrillic for handwriting, and Latin on the computer, phone and Internet mostly
Although for certain things, like essays, or something more formal I like to use Cyrillic
Also, when filling in blank spaces on documents or questionnaires or something like that I write in the script that the document is printed in, I usually don't like mixing scripts
In general, I match the script to its "environment", as it should be done
I only write my own signature in Cyrillic (which is also in cursive)
Everything else in Latin - especially computer-related
I don't even have a Cyrillic keyboard enabled on my PC
Cyrillic is preferred in schools and the official/government-issued documents
I did use Cyrillic a lot back in my school days but I really can't remember the last time I wrote something with pen and paper that is not like a sticky-note
Nowadays I would usually write these in Latin
It is Cyrillic handwritten, Latin online for most people
I know some patriots and literature fans who use Cyrillic online and I know some people who use exclusively Latin but for the most part people use Cyrillic when writing and Latin when typing
I use exclusively latin, i learned to read very early when i was maybe 5 or 6 years old, i don't even remember exactly  when and how (probably it came with comics and footbal albums with sticker images i adored)
It was natural and built into me because all those imported press and materials
It was in the '80's, still Yugoslavia
I know cyrilics, i don't even aknowledge which alphabet is when i read, but i am having big problems when i need to write especialy cursive which is required in some situations, for example when you need to write the statement in the bank during signing promissory note
Then it gets really embarassing, once some lady had to guide my hand to remind me of damn cursive T.
If I am writing by hand I start first word cyrillic, than on the middle of third word switch to latin and by fifth I am writing english and than end up writing english pronunciations in Cyrillic
Latin 90% of the time
Unless it is required or if I'm filling a form that's in cyrillic for example, I'd go for cyrillic then
When I have a choice I use Cyrillic almost exclusively
As an MD at work when using medical systems I have to write in Latin, which is  there out of inertia and convenience in order to not switch constantly between Cyrillic and Latin when writing out diagnosis and other Latin (language) medical terms
I pretty much write only in Latin unless I'm required to write in Cyrillic, or if the document I'm filling out is in Cyrillic
Never found Cyrillic very visually pleasing for some reason, so I tend to avoid it
I like Cyrillic more but often I have to use Latin a lot when talking with Bosnians or Croatians
Also there are a lot of places in Serbia with things written in Latin
When i write on Serbian i type on Cyrillic 99% of the time
I think Cyrillic is in great danger now, and in my opinion we should write on the most beautiful alphabet more
Latin, it's hard to type on cyrllic keyboard and i got used to latin because i don't have to change keyboard when i want to type in English after typing in Serbian
I used to use cyrilic cursive in handwriting, and latin online, but then, it looks odd when you have chemistry formula or english or french, so I switched to latin
Then on uni, I went full latin, because of chemistry, and now I’m almost always use latin
Oh gosh of course latin, if I could I would just snap those people that type like this: Бил Гејтс (Bill Gates)
So awful and annoying
Latin; almost always- Cyrillic only on government documents
I use Latin on the internet but i write in cursive Cyrillic most of the time as force of habit
T in Serbian cyrllic is literally from Chernobyl
We have keyboards that have Latin letters that are present in Serbian Latin script like š,č,ć,đ
Cyrillic is mandatory on tests and reports and books are on Cyrillic
I also know few professors that would give you an F for writing in latin
Nope, just the regular script you use for English, but the Serbian version with some added letters like šđćčž
The Latin script
Unfortunately I don't know roman Latin language, that would be pretty badass
Although I'm thankful I didn't have to learn it in school, as it was a pain in the ass for everyone
90% letters are  same but Y and Z are swaped
Q=љ W=њ X=џ and we have few letters bonus 2 next to P (ш ђ) 3 next to L (ч ћ ж)
Oh and most things like )(\*(#($)&#)$(<L><?": are completly diffrent keys
1999 wars
I can't decide between creating Yugoslavia or creating second Yugoslavia
The battle of Maritza (1371) and Yugoslav wars (1991-1999)
That mistake has many names, just like the devil: State SHS, Kingdom SHS, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, FNRY, SFRY
Yugoslavia, a mistake we repeated twice
Heard of breaking Yugoslavia
Probably "electing" Tito and the establishment of communist socialism in Yugoslavia
There is this dead meme in the Serbian community that Bulgarians are backstabbers because of that war
Lmao true
Second really, in first we forgave ethnic cleansing
In the second we forgave outright genocide
no one thought it'd not become a full scale war, both sides simply thought they'd win quickly
WW1 was unlike any war before it
For me, personally it's
Cold <2°C
Chilly 3°C - 19°C
Nice 20°C - 26°C
Warm 27°C - 31°C
Hot >30°C
Freezingly cold anything below -15
Cold -15 to 0
Chilli 0 to 15
Warm/pleasant 15 to 30
Hot 30 to 40
Kinda same here, but hot for me is 28+
Red Star Belgrade (Crvena Zvezda) in my opinion
Simplicity and quality
We should give them sea of Serbia
That way Hungary and North Macedonia could have a coast and God knows that Bosnia needs some of it too
We should be transfered somewhere in the Pacific
Screw you, guys, were rowing home
I'd probably say our hospitality
and if Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania chip in, we'll be the most hospitable place on earth
Wooden shoes
Basically for here in Serbia its:
Medicine; I mean you can pretty much guess why but our medicine faculty is decent and our doctors are capable, even so a lot get offers from the germans and such to come there and work
Engineering; again a no brainer since our best uni is the Electical Tehnical Faculty where most of our engineers go, if ya go there you also get offered a job pretty much by the 2and or 3rd year and I do mean that literally
My friend got a contract from BMW and works for them in Munich
Likewise another one got a contract in his 3rd year by Nvidia
Law; I myself study and go to this faculty and there is always a job open
Ironically more and more lawyers are in demand since now ya basically, at least here, almost all the time ya need a lawyer to do some shit like check yer contract, make the contract, represent ya and whatnot
Plus ya can do many stuff and work in many areas with this like social services, notary (the lad that that puts in the stamp to guarantee the validity of a document like yer will or legalise some shit)
Specially since our IT sector (I will get to it next) is booming a lot of startup IT companies are demanding us to legally represent them and write the contracts
You wont believe the legal nightmare it is for these, specially ownership of the codes they write
copyright is a pain as you can tell let alone lines of code
IT; yup much like the whole of balkans computer science is booming
The IT sector is becoming the main thing here and the market is in high demand for programmers
The pay is really good too
My bro is doing his masters in this and man the contract he got is
really nice
He just has to finish his masters which is soon now
Agriculture; ye here it's a big thing and one of our main industries
More and more young people are starting to do this here and this is excellent bc a lot go aboard and get better deals
A lot even come back here
My cousin came back from Germany to our countryside village and  he inherited a big chunk of land
He legit makes a killing from vegetables and dairy
He is more and more selling domestically and less aboard to help out here, similarly his peers too
Our [Slava] custom
I though that was something all Orthodox Christians did, but it turns out that's a very specific thing unique to our culture
Similar to you, I thought our barbecue street food was universal
Turns out hamburgers are an American food to you
Also, didn't know that people in most other countries use cofee-makers instead of [this
When I was on a skiing trip to Malyovitsa, I was playing pool (billiards) in the hotel and wanted to buy another round
I walk up to the girl that works there and ask her for more coins and she looks me dead in the eyes and shakes her head, without saying a word
I stand there thinking "why can't I play more, it's not even late, they're still open, other guys are playing too, is it something I said, did I offend her
" when she comes back and hands me the coins with a smile
I was looking at her confused for a couple of seconds and then I remembered
Even though I knew about the custom, it really takes some getting used to
[pretty widespread here]
> Sugar-coated
>  or chocolate-coated almonds being the typical Easter treat
[we have something similar, they're coated peanuts though]
yes, literally no country besides France can master that 5 ingredient staple food lasting for millenias
Most of our Orthodox customs are originally pagan, even the Christmas ones - paljenje badnjaka etc
We do
Obv havent been to Belgrade, theres a bakery like every 100m
Exactly, but people usually think it's the most Christian thing ever
Croatia
Probably Croatia, i don't care what others think its simply true
Umm
Hello there
We screwed up badly in the last thirty years
Also the Roma
They underwent compulsory sterilization in Sweden as late as 1976
I think the treatment of Muslims in Mojkovac and Kolašin is the least often mentioned atrocity in Montenegro's history
i don't think even Croats think that Croatia is innocent
but world thinks
Montenegro wasn't called Serbian Sparta for nothing
We have Vojvodina and Kosovo (depending on who you ask)
Vojvodina has cultural and political autonomy since the creation of Second (Communist) Yugoslavia, but most of their economy is state - controlled
For Kosovo, serb - populated parts are controlled by state, while others (mainly albanian - populated Kosovo parts) are not
When I was on tour of it (by boat) we were told that only 2 female species are allowed on the island, chicken, for their eggs which are essential for producing certain icons, and cats, to keep the mice population at control, now I am not sure how do they control other female species but female cats are allowed
We also eat a lot of dumplings (plum is more common than apricot though), and I assume that we got that during Austria-Hungary occupation of Vojvodina which is north region of Serbia
In Belgrade there is a small chain of pastry shops called "[Ferdinand knedle] and they produce all kinds of different combinations of tastes, both, sweet and salty variations
Check it out if you get a chance
edit: typo
Gomboce
Avala tower, Golubac, Kalemegdan and a few other forts and the most disturbing one, Ćele kula
Monument to an unknown hero on Kalemegdan fortress or Petrovaradin Fortress
I think because of Exit festival, Petrovaradin fortress is more famous to foreigners
It is Saint Sava 100%, I think all of those guy above you mentioned are famous, but not that distinguishable
Saint Sava temple is probably the most famous building in Serbia
I literally don't know anyone that ever ate raw meat
bonus points if its your own dog
Here we eat soup almost every day
It's a really big part of our cuisine
2 times:
?(around 8th century)-1459 (Ottomans took over)
1878 (officially, though we had maximal autonomy and de facto independence decades before)-present
3000AD/7th centry-Random Euroasian horde(we were 2000 years late wtf)
7th cebtry/1166-A Byzantine Вазал
1166/1371-Nemanjic age
1867/1914-Independence
1919/1940-Yugo 1
1945/2006Yugo 2
2006/now-Just Serbia
From 630/780 (depends who you ask) until 1459 (important note although in early period we were mostly independent and kinda doing our own thing, we were as well briefly occupied or annexed by Byzantines or Bulgarians for some short periods, this as well includes all Serb inhabited states like Raška, Duklja, Travunija and Paganija)
Then from 1459-1804 part of Ottoman empire, uprising in 1804 great autonomy 1830, independence 1878 this lasted until 1915 when were occupied by Austrians, Germans and Bulgarians liberated in 1918, then kingdom of Yugoslavia until 1941 (1945 in exile) then commie times until end of Yugoslav wars 1995, union with Montenegro until 2006 and then modern day Republic of Serbia,
Side note: i can't really count times when Serbia was part of Yugoslavia, since Yugoslavia was mostly Serb dominated, especially Kingdom of Yugoslavia
Serbia under Nemanjić rule
Serbia from 1878-1921
Serbia today
Tribe*
You do know that Serbian Despotate was conquered only in 1459 right
The Independent State of Croatia wasn't really independent
Do all (or most) Russian nationalists have a unified view of the USSR
What is it
Its the moment I realized
I fucked up
I fucked up again
Sienna
Really nothing *that* special
Also Pisa
It's top three interesting things are the tower, the cathedral, and then the Subway nearby
Literally nothing to see or do there except take a picture and leave
The rest of Tuscany was absolutely breathtaking, though
(Edit: Subway as in the fast food chain)
I live in Novi Sad and Belgrade is really near but I avoid going there
It's so noisy and dirty
Even though Novi Sad is becoming like that I have a feeling that Belgrade is on whole other level
Me too
Athens is a bit
gritty in some parts, but there are so many wonderful things to see, such an interesting city
Thessaloniki was lovely
I love Greece overall, there is no part I didn't like, and a was there like 10 times
I was on Corfu this summer, the city and the whole island is beyond beautiful
Ancient Rome, Ancient Greek and Otoman empire are the 3 cultures that we learn the most
We also learn about other major cultures, and spend some time with them, like Mongolian empire or Huns among others
While any other culture that has little to no impact on us (all people, or just Serbs) are only mentioned and we don't go too deep into them
In Serbian, every letter is pronounced, well, as it is supposed to
H is pronounced as H in hard, hot, hell
Its always pronounced, and is the same as h in hello
Unlike spanish or italian, for example, it doesn't change surrounding letters
For example "ch" in spanish, or "ci" and "chi" in italian
Not really i'd love to visit every European country (yes even the microstates)
I wouldn't visit Moldova because i think it's boring there
What
Where do you have to do that
'U pički materini' which translates to 'In a mother's pussy'.
Obviously a slang term but commonly used to refer to something far away
Bogu iza nogu - behind god's legs
In Serbian there are multiple expressions meaning "really far away". The most polite one is "Bogu iza nogu" which means "behind God's legs", there is "u pizdi materinoj" which means "in the mother's cunt", "u tri lepe" which literally means "in three beautiful", but refers to three beautiful cunts (I find that pretty weird myself)
We also have an expression with a toponym - "Tunguzija" - which refers to the Evenkiysky District in Russia
"Bogu iza nogu" Behind God's legs
"Pičkovci" Cuntville
"Vukojebina" ¿a place were wolves fuck
My personal favorite is "vukojebina" (a place where wolves fuck)
That one works too, yeah
Not really something they said, but my friend and I helped a group of Chinese tourists find a park/fortress they were looking for
All 20 of them then proceeded to take selfies with us
Asking if there are Mountains in Austria is like looking for potatoes in Ireland
>He wanted to show his son, that people my age do work here in Denmark
He apparently found it very inspirational
Having worked with the Japanese for the past 5 years, this doesn't surprise me at all
My friend moved to Shanghai with her husband and son and when they went to Disneyland recently, so many Chinese visitors wanted a photo with her son
He is a blonde and blue eyed kid, pretty tall for his age and he was treated like a movie star
The kid had a blast
My blonde, blue-eyed friend and my ginger friend went to Shanghai too and had the same experience
I do have blonde hair and she has blue eyes, so that might've been it
They're funny tourists in general, always in groups and snapping pictures of everything
Not necessarily normal, but considering their work ethic and the increasing number of NEETs that the older generations frown on, it makes perfect sense
I had a Japanese student who worked in Germany and he was delighted to tell me kids had Praktikum and another one who visited Denmark and had a similar reaction to the country's organization
Edit: I meant to say that the Japanese make sure to instill the "law, order and discipline" in their children as early in life as possible, so you can imagine how what you mentioned appeals to them
I don't know if those would be Ukrainian loanwords to Russian
Those examples are common Slavic words that, for one reason or another,  stopped being used that way in Russian
I don't know Russian or Ukrainian, though
Besides learning breaf world and European history, my historical education went something like this:
6th century, slavs migrate to Balkan
Skip
12th to 15 century: Nemanjić dinasty, we get church authonomy, this guy bilt this monastery, this one built this, one guy reads a lot about Alexander the great and wants to be roman empire, but he dies, and his son is bad, so empire falls appart, then we fight Ottomans, win the battle but loose most of the army and nobility, so Ottomans conquer us
Skip to seage of Vienna, the holy league wins, so Serbs rebel, but Austrie doesn't give a sht, so the great migration of Serbs
Skip to 1804, first uprising, we do good, but Napoleon invades Russia; so we loose, but then we fight again in 1814, and win, and cultural and national renesance, language standardised, wars with Turks and constantly fearing Austria
Absolutism, constitution, absolutism, constitution, we become a kingdom, but then king is sht, and his son is even bigger sht, so we kill him, and bting the other dinasty, then the assassins accidentally start WW1, we win, but then we loose, retreat to Corfu, paybeck time, we win, make yugoslavia, but serbs and croats dont cooperate, so absolutism, then king gets killed, germany wants us in axis, but nope
WW2 time, occupied in 2 weeks, but nope, for we are used to rebelling at this point, so we fight germans, and civil war at the same time
Communists win, liberated, Yugoslavia 2
0, socialism y'all
We say no to soviets, almost go to war, then Stalin dies, then Soviets invade hungary, we almost go to war, then Soviets invade Czechoslovakia, almost to war
Then Tito dies, we mennage to get by for 10 more years, thwn 90s start, and we finally have a war, so we killed each other a bit, this guy thinks he is Tito, so America decides to help us by bombing the sht out of us, then we owerthrow Milošević.
That would be 12 years of my history education in one longer reddit comment
Edit:6th century slavic migration, not 9th
Dont ask
Our books just cram everything in 4 years,not looking if its important or not
Its hard af
Like others have said we don't learn year by year more like by hundred years and periods
We also don't learn about our own countries history (well obviously we do) but how it fits into a whole European narrative
For instance we have:
• Slavic Balkan settlements
• Christianised, feudal medieval time
• Turkish occupation for centuries (this is the time we usually focus on the rest of Europe and we skip a couple of hundred years)
• Serbian uprising, independence, proclamation of the Kingdom
• This nicely leads into WW1, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, WW2, Cold War and then you're done
This is all a 4 year process
Technically 8 since in elementary school you learn the same thing but less details
Belgrade is called Beograd in Serbian
Beograd = beo (white) + grad (city), so White City
Acording to some sources when Slavs came to this area they saw white Roman/Celtic walls of the old fortifications and that is how it got its new name
Romans used to call it Singidunum before that
Belgrade (originally Beograd) comes from the words "beo" meaning white, and "grad" meaning city
It was named that because the fortress looked white from the river
Furthermore, "grad" comes from Indo European word for closed space in open, which is the same word that "garden" came from, however the meaning here shifted more towards a closed space by walls, for defense
They ‘predu’. Mačka prede= A cat purrs
The infinitive is ‘predeti’
The noun is ‘predenje’
*I've seen enough internet to know where this is going*
Belgrade university
It's basically the same everywhere
The age-old trope of stereotypical Russian / Ambigously Slavic bad guys and villains in Hollywood action films

We'd just highkey root for them the entire time, I feel - so it's a lost cause to even attempt that plot-device with us
Missing a Croatian sentence: "Za slavu unije"

Glava, ramena, stomak, kolena
Oči, uši, usta medena

About 20€ per week
But that is just for me
That seems about right for me too
Oh we all heard that one
well that's more understandable
Hey if it gets him the votes from a demographic he needs, it's not stupid

yeah, just be a nazi ally
Not EU but I believe only citizens should be allowed to vote including citizens living outside the country
I doubt that there are many 45+ year old Easter Europeans visiting reddit who could give you their first hand experience with communism
Speaking from experience of my older family members they lived way better lives than they and most of my generation live today
Though Yugoslavia is not so great example since it was open to the west
And since our standard of living drastically decreased during the wars in the '90s.
As a personal example, my parents were born just after WW2
They were never members of the party (my mother is also Italian, my grandfather was even imprisoned for a few years after WW2 because of that)
Both of them had only high school education and worked in a steel mill as an administrative workers
And with their salaries they could afford to go on vacations to Greece, Spain, Malta, Tunissia, Italy, Germany, France
They also got large appartment from a company they worked at and were able to buy it out in a few years (companies were building appartment complexes for their workers and giving them an option to buy them out by deductiong monthly payments from their salaries with some minimal interest rates)
At the same time they also got and repaid bank loan which they used to build a summer vacation house
I'm currently lucky enough to earn few times more than the average sallary in here, and I won't be able to afford one fifth of that
Hell it took me 5 years of investments just to fully renovate entire appartment
And my mother is stuck with 200 euros per month pension
It was better than now
I mean we are starting to rebuild from NATO aggression slowly so I hope it will be better
>After the fall of communism the transition to free-market was brutal not even regarding the fact of systemic corruption
You guys were lucky, you "only" had to deal with those issues :)
We also had to deal with wars, hyperinflations and economic sanctions
In '90s steel mill my parents worked at lost all of it's foreign market and supliers
And they successfully worked with companies from Japan to Canada during the '70s and '80s.
At one point everything was so bad that instead of salaries they were giving workers half rotten pig's meat, powdered milk, 10 year old laundry detergent and worthless coupons
At the end factory was bombed in 1999, what was left of it was bankrupted and sold to the Americans
Saddest thing is that this is still a positive story more or less
After all that it is now owned by Chinese and it is currently largest exporter in Serbia
At least you are now "free" of srbocetniks, and we are "free" of ustasa
At least until we meet each other in Germany as gastarbeiter
Yes I know tito was killing Serbs and I can't forgive him
I didn't personally live under communism but I hear everyone saying it's was so good, that they had money to go to like turkey nearly every summer
Most ironic thing is that easiest way to end up as a political prisoner in Yugoslavia, at least until mid '50s, was to be Stallinist or Soviet leaning in general
Swedish seems like a good language for rap music
My friend made a joke "He who digs a hole beneath someone is physical worker"(Ko pod drugim jamu kopa fizicki je radnik)
I can travel to Bosnia, Montenegro, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia, I can understand about 30-40% of Bulgarian and for some reason Turks understand me better when I speak Serbian rather than English even though I cant understand any Turkish at all even if they spoke very slowly
We often joke about how Yugoslavia will reunite inside Germany

Shit just went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick
i mean, the only difference between the two is the wealth, it seems
Also don't forget Bosnia had a recent war which is the reason for the discord between the people, Belgium on the other hand doesn't even have a war to blame that on lol
Bosnia of course

Bosnia, Montenegro,turkey

I used to work with a bloke from England and in the winter, he would always smoking outside wearing just a dress shirt
We would freeze just by looking at him
Or you know, you could buy Vojvodina and have big fertile region
Our current politicians would be more than willing to sell for the right price and I don't think people would mind being part of Norway
100% safe
Did it myself alone a lot of times (anywhere between 12 am and 5 am)
Novi Sad is a city of 300k people and I feel completely safe at all times
I had a habit of late night runs and it was nice and quiet with streets mostly empty
There are few drunken beggars but they keep to themselves
Yes the [Gusle]
Well it is really hard to pinpoint one event since for the last 2k years something is always going on in my region (Balkan) and city (Belgrade, Serbia)
Its really tourbolent area
But like I would maybe say that some of the interesting facts about Belgrade is that in its long history (3rd century BC) there were 115 recorded battles over it and it was razed to the ground 44 times
Gore - up/forests/mountains
More - sea
Roman - novel

Just learn a bit of the language, and most importantly respect: the people,the country, the history
Do this and you will be fine

Hahahahah" cue my head hitting the desk
When they actually get where I'm from its "Oh you have internet (or any basic necessity) there
All Slavs are Russian and speak it
We aren't white
We are uncultured , drunk , communist always in war and is SO DANGEROUS here etc
And many,many more retarded things I've heard about my country
It's juts
it's sad tbh
I love my boyfriend , and thankfully he wasn't that ignorant but some of his American friends aren't that bright and jokingly telling him when I visit they'll have to hide the valuables so I don't steal them isn't so hahaha to me
A villa overlooking the Danube River and Fruska gora mountain with a swimming pool and huge garden
Belgrade
You can get a 120-50 sqm apartment in Belgrade waterfront (the massive high-end housing project being built at the moment)
You could also buy pretty much any appartment in Belgrade
Prices vary from ~1000e to ~5000e per square meter depending on the neighbourhood
You could also buy the vast majority of houses, with the exception of a few neighbourhoods with high-end mansions where you won't have enough for the more expensive ones
Scott in serbian (but spelled with k and only one t, same proncinantion) means basterd/son of a bitch
Weirdly enough, ala is archaism in Serbian and have similar meaning
And former USA ambassador to Serbia had a last name Scott, so his pr used to ask the journalists to (inacurately) transcribe his name into Skat, so it wouldn't resemble Skot (son of a bitch) that much lol
So, what's your name for English people then
Lmao everything is in English
Most people in Europe (especially the youth) are bilingual (English+ their native language)
Edit for clarification: by bilingual, I meant that they're able to communicate in English without a huge problem, not that they're absolutely flawless in speaking it
Rural areas sure, but I've never had issues communicating with locals in any city, bigger town, or tourist destinations, and I've been lucky enough to travel a lot
Most people I've met around Europe speak English - maybe not always fluently, but enough to be able to communicate
By 'bilingual' I just mean enough to understand them, yknow
The youth is great at English, though
I think the rise of social media, especially with the dominant websites being primarily in English (reddit, tumblr, insta, 9gag, deviantart, youtube…) has definitely contributed to that
Video games, music, movies, and other kinds of media have also played a huge role in that, too
I have a
I mean, if 55-60% speak another language, isn't that most people being bilingual
I mean there's 700+ million people and over 40 countries, it always depends on the country lol
In general they're pretty good at it though
I clarified in another comment about what I mean by bilingual
Also, I highly doubt that
I'm from an underdeveloped Eastern European country and most young people I've met (lets say people in high school and college) are perfectly capable of watching a movie in English and understand what's going on
I won't speak for your country, but I had the pleasure of visiting it several times (it's really beautiful) and everyone I spoke to was perfectly fine speaking English
depends on the country
I wouldn't say so for Serbia
I don't notice people mess up grammar and spelling more often, but I do notice more people using anglicisms, both existing ones and non-existing ones
Then again, Serbian had historically been very open to borrowing words, so
You may be surprised, but German dialects have more variety than Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian/Montenegrin/whatever

actually Neumann didn't event the computer, he invented the architecture the modern computer uses
It's actually more important
don't worry about it, take it easy :)

Lobbying is a real thing in the EU for a while now, but people turned a blind eye to it
Not sure how does that change what Ive said but ok

A lot of people put ketchup or mayo on top of their pizza here
If an Italian came here and saw what we add on pizzas,he/she would commit suicide
Ketchup & sour cream
What about Hot dogs on pizza
Pros: Good food
Cons: low salaries (bad economy) + for Belgrade: too many people, pollution, bad public transport
Pros:Weather,cheap,not too many people, education, nightlife,fast internet connection,5G rolled out in 2019 in Subotica and Belgrade,memes,there are no vegans running up to you and annoying you
Cons: Immigrants, Corruption,(un)safety,a war can break out any moment,cancer(nato uranium '99),the most annoying famous people and ,,Gasers",the most incompetent politicians(reply for explanation),a stubborn minister of education trying to ruin it
No mosquitoes
Hello new neighbours
I really like Polish patriotic song "Rota" and the Russian "Sacred War" as well as the Slovak anthem "Nad Tatrou sa blýska"
2014 floods were pretty bad, 16 municipalities were flooded or around 1/4th of the territory was affected, 57 people died and over €500mil in damage
2010 Kraljevo earthquake (5
4 on Richter scale, VII-VIII on Mercalli scale), over €100mil in damage
1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, estimated $26 billion in economic losses, over 1000 killed, 5700 wounded, large infrastructure damage, hospitals, buildings, roads, bridges, factories, refineries and what is the largest issue is rapid increase of cancer patients thanks to the uranium used in bombs
Balkaners are stereotyped as being drunk on rakija, which is far from truth
If we talk about most consumed alcoholic beverages in Serbia (in particular), rakija would be about 4th or 5th place, certainly below beer and wine and probably even vodka aswell
Honestly i believe it's Ćevapi
We eat it when we go out in kafanas and restaurants and rarely i believe as a linch or dinner
We eat Burek and pljeskavica much more
we eat it in serbia during christmas holidays
It's popular with rural folks, but for city ones it's not that popular
* To get child to speak give him goat bell of 1st goat in heard to drink wather from it
* God will punish you if you work on holy days (no house work, no washing clouse, you can just cook and wash dishes) - fun fact/story one of my grate grate grandads brother had gone to filed to work on day its forbitten with his wife, there was 0 clouds in sky and lithing striked him and killed him in spot
* if you hick up that meas someone is speaking about you that moment

Supper old one witch is not in use like past 1300ish years but its part of culture now
in old days (pagan) it was belived to you can only be Hexed/cursed if the one who is casting it on you know your name, so 1st presone who gave you name was not your parents it was close persone to them (today its equivalent to godfather), and that persone would be only one who knows your name, later parent picked name that they and other people called you by
now that name is "church name" still godfather give it to you will you baptise
Vojvodina for a region, and Novi Sad/Subotica as cities which are in Vojvodina
Oh thanks, I feel a sourge of local patriotism now
Not related to the question or your comment, I just want to ask how is programming in Russia (education for it and as a job)
That's nice to hear, I might study in Moscow and it'll probably be something IT-related
Thank you
I'm gonna start attending real courses in September, but I did learn some very very basic stuff over the internet already
It's indeed a very similar language to ours, one notable difference I caught is that it has many English words, while Serbian doesn't and instead has a lot of Turkish words (since we were ruled by them for 5 centuries)
Maybe 60% of the vocabulary are words I already know from Serbian and English, and the grammar is very similar to Serbian
So yeah, much easier for someone like me to learn Russian than a let's say American
Trust me Eastern Europe is a huge mess
Cheap and quite popular because of it
I dont think it is, no
It's not considered bad either though
Good markets are Maxi, Aroma and Univerexport I'd say
Followed by Idea
We consider Lidl good, but that's because of the prices, not quality, for that we go to the local markets
In my country its mediocre
Its cheap but bad quality
Of course, I've got plenty of female friends and dude friends and we all hang out with each other
Nothing weird about it, in fact I enjoy it more this way
Here it's totally normal, at least in Belgrade
Most people I know have platonic friendships of the opposite sex, and no one really questions it
yeah, of course they can
granted, older people will always assume that you're interested in each other but assuming things is their job
Yea ofc
Ah, going for coffee, the thing which solves all problems in our region
I stay silent until the other person speaks, then I respond
Or if it's someone i know I go "Halo

780 or 630, first known ruler of Serbia Viseslav ruled from 780 to 829, so excluding Turkish and periodic Byzantine rule we've  existed in some form for 1240 up to 1390 years but including Turkish and periodic Byzantine/Bulgarian  rule it would be something like 850 or 1000 years
Around 8th century, similar with Croatia
It's older than the universe
Sometime around 780 the Principality of Serbia was proclaimed
It's a double edged sword though
We actually did, it was named “home economics” (domaćinstvo), when I went to primary school, was in 6th grade (we start at 7yo), so I was 6th grade sometime during 1992; was Yugoslavia, we had civil war and world sanctions and whatnot - so our home economics class was - only a theory
No cooking, per se, whatsoever
Fucking turning lathes
We *had* to use that thing for every little insignificant thing
It was a part of *general technical education* class
Not sure if it exists anymore, but it didn't use to be gendered
There also used to be a "homekeeping" (domaćinstvo) class, but it got canceled nation-wide during the early '90s.
If it's citizenship by ancestry I'm in favour of it
If your grandparents or parents moved away to another country but you want to return you should be able to get citizenship
People like this be really tend to want to learn the language anyways
I don't know my neighbours, but some of my friends do and talk with them sometimes
Same
God damn it, how many pictures can one appartment hold
And is it necessary to hang it right now
One would think that we appreciate culture that much just by drilling holes any time of a 24h day
Belgrade, Serbia here
My commute to school is around 20mins with the waiting on the bus stop
But the comfort level is like 0 because most of the time the bus is overcrowded
Belgrade
I work in the old city center, so it's really expensive to park there, and impossible/unsafe to bike there (no bike lanes, no bike parking stands), so I'll either walk for 45 minutes or ride the bus for 10-30 minutes, depending on how the traffic is
I miss biking, and yearn for better public transport planning
Klaus, Freya, Ragnar and Baldur sound really cool and powerful
Ana-Maria, although not foreign anymore it's quite rare
Liam, Leo
I like those
Halina (Polish) or Persephone (Greek) for a girl
When it comes to male names, I really like Welsh ones, the spelling and everything - Rhys, Aled, Owain, Gwylim
Cleetus, Skeeter, Duck
Here's some other cool Slavic names: Ratomir, Caslav, Vlastimir, Rastislav, Cedomir and many others
I'd say that there is a lot of variations of same names across Slavic nations
45; sometimes never
Girls move out when they get married, and guys stay with their parents and bring their wife home
Joking aside, I moved out sometime around 25, my friends moved out anytime between 18-30, though later was more common
I'm in my early thirties now, no one of my friends lives with parents anymore
Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be able to live like that either, I moved out a year ago (I'm 24) and more and more people move out, but many still live with their parents, especially outside the big cities
It's a cultural thing
I guess more people own their houses here than in West Europe or the US, so they would probably get them anyway after their parents' died
(So why just not wait there haha)
everything
I saw an inscription in Serbian at a university library toilet door in the Netherlands
It was really weird, because all the other inscriptions were in English and they were really inspiring such as 'Just keep going' etc
but the one in Serbian said 'Kakve su ti sise, takav ti je život', which means 'As are your boobs, such is your life'.
Yep
So is the myth
This
It's not about what race they are, but what they do
Problem is not the color of their skin
It's their behaviour
Do you people not get that
not me, I find it boring
[Serbian Epic poetry] impressed Goethe so much that he spoke some Serbian in order to understand it better, Goethe compared beauty of SEP to the "Song of Solomon".
Did thay bomb muslims or serbs
You'd be surprised how many countries have variations of baked beans
In Serbia, it's called prebranac
hahah same, we call it kids champagne, though we also have it sold regularly
There is a soup like variation of beans in all ex-Yugoslavian countries but prebranac is much thicker
When it's well made (especially in a traditional clay made pot) with paprika and Bay leaves its pure art
That Serbia started WW1 and wars on Balkans in the '90s
We buy the same beers we usually do
But we do have special homemade brandies for holidays, they are usually more than 50% alcohol
Yes, very common in Eastern Europe especially in villages or suburbs
What's an air heat pump
Googled but I'm not sure if I get it, like an air conditioning unit but used only for heating
Yeah, that's what made me wonder, Sweden and air pumps
We use them here and we usually call them inverters
Our winters are pretty mild compared to Sweden or the USA, at least that's my ignorant expectation
I used this kind of heating myself, and my electricity bill surprised me in a happy sense, but we don't get too far below zero
Yeah, that's what I heard about the units we can get
And it surprised me, the way the unit can work even at -20, it's mindblowing that you actually make the winter even colder so you can get warm :)
We reached our peak then and we learn about it, but not too much since it didn't last long
they gave coffee to the entire Europe technically
It was an empire
We had 2 emperors: Dušan Silni and Uroš Nejaki
Dušan formed the empire and it was insanely huge in size, but he died at a young age and his son Uroš was too young and unprepared to rule such an empire, so like 15 higher class people divided the empire and all wanted to rule it and become the emperor, then the Ottomans came and took everything
Osaka (cherry blossoms)
Tokyo (capital)
Kyoto (ex-capital I think)
Hiroshima (nuke)
Nagasaki (nuke)
Kobe (like the basketball player)
Saitama (like the One Punch Man character)
Nagoya (don't know why I remember this one)
Kawasaki (like the Kawasaki bikes)
Yokohama (not sure how I know this one either)
I know a few more names but I think they are districts of Tokyo, also is Himeji a city as well
I remember it after the castle
Nothing else comes to mind, majority of places I remember are by associating them with an object or a person
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Kobe, Nagoya, Nagasaki, Niigata, Aomori, Sendai, Sapporo, Hakodate, Kumamoto, Fukuoka
I don't know about stuff like Saitama and Chiba, it's all Tokyo to me
Srbija to Tokyo
I would say Milan Nedić, the head of provisional government of rump Serbia under direct German military occupation
Previously, he was participant in first world war and in Serbia retreat across Prokletije mountains and Albania which was greatly valued in Serbia, later, he was an officer in Yugoslav army and subsequently general chief of staff of the army
Germans appointed him and during his rule Serbia was partitioned between Albania, Bulgaria, Independent republic of Croatia and Hungary, there was numerous crimes against civilians
He was arrested by Yugoslav partisans and he auto defenestrated himself while waiting his trial
He was not a pre WWII hero in a sense like marshal Peten was, but the Germans used him as somewhat a figure of some authority
A lot of Serbs start referring to Vuk Branković when they talk about stuff like that
Or it just gets used in normal conversations as a joke where they tell you that you shouldn't be Vuk Branković.
During the Battle for kosovo in 1389, Emperor Lazar and his Vassals were fighting the Ottomans and Vuk was also there
He had the biggest army in the old Serbian Kingdom, so they relied on him
And just as it seemed that Serbia would win that battle, he misteriously retreated and left the Emperor and other Soldiers to fight alone, causing them to lose and die
No one has ever found out the reason why he did it
But still he is regarded because of that as the biggest traitor of Serbia
In our tales Vuk Branković betray Kneza(idk translation of Knez) Lazara but he did not betray him
He saw that the battle at Kosovo is over and got his army back at Serbia
He was participating in battles
I think thata biggest traitor was Milos Obrenovic
Yes he got Seebia independent but killed Karadjordja greats hero Serbia have seen
Imho, Nedić did the best he could in his very limited position, he did stuff like keep the border with Croatia open so Serb refugees could flee
He also tried to get on some German generals good side, so Serbia could be in a bit of a better position
Although he is a collaborationist, he wasn't the worst by far
Dimitrije Ljotić on the other hand is our biggest traitor by far, he and his men slaughter Serb, Roma, Jew civilians right there with the Nazis
Absolute piece of shit
This is very poorly written and also has useless information
Vuk Branković is only a traitor in literature because he pulled out of the battle, and Miloš Obrenović simply wasn't a traitor
Nedić was somewhat respected and was part of chief of staff, while Ljotić was nobody
Even Germans didn't want to do anything with him, and he was a Nazi in Serbia
He was a special kind of piece of shit, collaborator and murderer, but he cannot be traitor, because he had nothing to betray in the first place
How do people see the current government
Most people (not all) still love and listen to ex-Yu music and movies made at the time the country existed
Love for burek, too (though there are some disagreements about its classification and subtypes)
\- Governments whose core base of voters are fanatic pensioners who rise in 7 AM to vote while healthy young people sleep until noon, wake up and see that it's a bit rainy today, and decide not to vote
\- Beautiful (but very demanding) girls all around, though they're distinct from each other depending on a country and regions within countries
\- Extremely prominent macho culture (except maybe in Slovenia)
\- Fanatical love of sports and obsession with betting shops (this is actually almost epidemic-level among men, starting at ages 12-13)
\- We're freaking tall
Very tall
edit: and of course, very similar cuisine and love of rakija
edit2: As the guy from Slovenia said in the comment, they don't fit into most of those descriptions and i agree
Honestly i find them much more similar to Western Slavic nations than to other ex-Yugos
We all really don't like Turks and we all have Inferiority and Superiority complex those are negative ones, although i don't think they apply to Slovenia that much
Besides Slovenes and North Macedonains we speak the same language
We all hate each other, but once we live in *insert western country* we become best buddies
We all like to smoke, drink, bet on sports
Semi-prominent football hooligan & ultra culture, especially Belgrade & Zagreb
We are actually pretty similar if you leave religion and politics out of the mix, but no one really wants to admit that
We all like turbofolk music
We all like fast cars
We all really like that 'badass' culture, guns, weapons, etc
Ajvar on everything
Add suspicious privatisation involved high ranking politicians, diplomats and people in the army to that
I'm in this comment and I don't like it
Love, too
Not everyone's consumed by negativity
No, ajvar is from southern Serbia and northern North Macedonia
I am speaking for Serbia here and I'd say the quality of Serbian music is much, much trashier than in other countries atm
Milomir Maric admitted himself that he pushed for Karleusa's career on BK TV in the nineties so Ceca wouldn't dominate the market (Ceca being Arkan's - Maric's archnemesis - wife)
He also got the green light from Karic who owned the network and made Maric "the cultural editor/director" of it
So, while Ceca ruled on Pink, Karleusa ruled on BK and they both set the standards of what's popular and profitable
It all went downhill from there
There are various interviews where he states this, the most informative one being an episode of Cirilica with Vanja Bulic, where Maric straight out told him (Bulic) he ruined the cultural standards by allowing turbo folk to be played on national television, after which Bulic hurriedly left the studio
Another one, much more serious was an Al Jazeera special where he explains that quizzes like Who Wants to Become a Millionaire were introduced to stupify people (along with turbo folk), and how those quizzes led to reality TV shows as they are now
I highly recommend watching it
Damn, that does sound amazing
Hopefully someone picks it over here
Damn those were two quality burns on Montenegrins and Bosnians lmao
Diggi kom mal Tipico
But on a real note, those shops make it so attractive to spend your money there
Its easy to get roped in, because it seems fun and harmless at first
Yeah at every point i thought ''wait i'm not sure that Slovenians fit in''. Generally you're too different to be put together with us, but all of these things are very common for Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Croatia
They're not new countries at all
All of them are very very old
They just unified at some point and then broke off
In the last couple of years bakeries becomes desperate, so we have now burek with kulen, burek with eurokrem, burek with apples and cinamon
It went to far
yes with sour cabbage but its not the best dish
Some people like it but most not really
Zeljanica isn't with spinach its with "zelje" (idk the english name) which is nicer and milder than spinach
Also often cheese goes along with it
You should dip it in pasta sauce
I honestly never met a Croat/Bosniak who had a bad opinion on me because I'm a Serb and vice versa
The hate is just political and the people don't hate each other
I agree
No, we’re not in Siberia
No, it's Yugoslav period chocolate and milk spread
It was famous for long time as second only to kinder lada spread
Nowdays they lost licence of production to yaffa, and now eurokrem is just black and white misery
Jaffa cream is where is at
But the name still standing
its this
it grows everywhere here and its got a reaaally nice taste
Yeah, good luck explaining it to my grandma
I don't know, really
I don't think it has anything to do with EU
When it was produced for the first time EU was Europe economic union or something
The licence was bought from Italian Gandola, if I'm not mistaking
I think I remember that one, too
But I liked kinder lada the most
I don't drink a lot and I get drunk easily
I hate most Serbian music played at parties weddings and other festivities
I think it's the trumpet which I hate the sound of
Like you I'm below average height, around 179cm and it's 182-183cm standard here
I don't wanna squeeze out ten babies in a bankrupt, destitute country to improve goddamn natality rates
I'm an atheist and I'm not a nationalist, I guess
Also our cuisine isn't great
But those *Serbians* on the other hand
Im guessing the appeal of Trumpet music went over your head :/
It really do be like that sometime
You can't that's the problem, I'll get you a stoole to stand on tho
In here porns are referred as Swedish action movies
"Why are you pretending to be English
" when someone is trying to be pretentious or something they are not
“Glup si kao turcin” wich means you are dumb as a turk
I heard an awful one (but it's also a great explainer):
[insert country name] are bigger [insert country name 2] than [insert country name 3]
I wont type it out so I don't offend anybody, but the way I hear it is usually us and some of our neighbours
So this is the balkans in a nutshell :)
I can't be 100% sure, but one of the urban legends I heard was that during the '70 first pornographic movies and magazines from west started appearing in ex YU
Mostly smuggled in by our expatriates from Germany and Scandinavian countries
There was black market for them where people would be selling them on the streets referring them as Swedish action movies
> My own parents used to let me sleep outside all the time in winter, even in -25C. Now I seldom get sick and am rather resistant to cold (-15c to -20c is still t-shirt weather to me)
this sounds like pseudoscience
We sing happy birthday in a completely different tune than anyone else
In English, German, French, etc
the words are changed but the tune itself is the same
In Serbian it's completely different, which I always found weird
Same here
Tito
Looks like they are getting worser with each generation
here you're called Rusini I think
Attacking Bulgaria for no right reason in 1885
In hindsight, Yugoslavia
Well, OP wrote "No modern politics please, it might turn ugly
And those recent things from 90s might still be  "modern politics", so i avoided them
Yeah, but that's not what Serbia did, that's what one Bosnian Serb did
Comparing Yugoslavia to Austro-Hungary is dumb
I don't think that's the dumbest, World War 1 would've happened eventually no matter if Gavrilo Princip killed Franz Ferdinand or not
And also Serbia as a country might have been connected, but it's not a thing our country did, but one man and his organization
1 being "multi ethnic" of peoples speaking pretty much the same language in a continuum
The other being almost all of the same peoples + Hungarians + Romanians + Germans + Slovaks + Czechs + Ukranians + Poles on top of it
I really don't see how do you think they're comparable
Actually, Montenegrins were pretty fine with that
Montenegrin politicians and people were supportive
>and actually committed genocide
On who
>If you are asking who did yugoslavia commit genocide on as a serb (judging from your user flair) then there are problems
Yes i am, im asking for clarification
> But fair enough, didn't know much about the Montenegrin part, was just assuming they were full of it as well
They themselves bombed the shit out of Dubrovnik for example
Which European country has the most beautiful design of car plates
No you can't. In most countries you can make choose letters, numbers or combinations
But you have to pay a lot
Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia, Montenegro, Slovenia have town codes too
Yes we play that game too
But you don't have many vehicles compared to others
Nike
com and literally any other big brand site doesn’t ship to serbia that very very sad
Its all fun and shit until they bite your finger
You can write only in Cyrillic

Like this country it’s a real living daily large hunger games but with stupid people
I can relate
Relate

I always felt that Croatia is great with geek culture
I grew up reading old SF magazines from Croatia (Sirius was probably best in Europe in that time), and Star Trek reruns on your national TV
That said, dnd and tabletop games are really popular in Serbia (or in big cities, I don't know about the rest), is it really not like that in Cro
How are the Amazon workers treated in your countries
Yes, we are using two writting systems and can write in both Latin and Cyrillic
So there's no way you can write Ukrainian with Latin alphabet
I just read somewhere that Serbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets
But the thing that confuses me is that I saw some Greeks and Russians writing in Latin
I suppose it can still be used to some extent
I assumed so, but the OP confused me because he said it was impossible
It is clearly possible to use, but the question is how functional it is
>That being said Serbians and Croatians are definitely the best in my experience at knowing both alphabets
Croatians don't use Cyrillic anymore (since they left Yugoslavia) but many of them however can understand it
That's right, it's the same language
I just said that Croatians no longer use Cyrillic, but however many of them can still understand it
Your father's name usually is your middle name, but rarely who uses it
It's extremely uncommon

I wear mostly sneakers and I can't wait to get back home and walk barefoot (or in slippers)
I'd be annoyed as fuck if I had to wear shoes indoors as well
I'm not against a federation, but I wonder why would anyone ever say that a Spaniard and a Finn are the same
What kind of idea is that
Integration does not mean that everybody is the same, at least that's not what I understad the word to mean
Isn't a federation a means of integrating different entities together
Wait wait did the betyárs have their kind of paprikash
I don't remember, maybe it was l mentioned in a side page or paragraph
We mention it, but don't go into details
• [Cathedral of Saint Sava] fourth largest Orthodox church in the world
• [Gračanica Monastery] a beautiful Byzantine influenced Monastery, sadly in danger
• [Beli Dvor] the White Palace, residency of the royal family, then Tito and now the former royal family
Pretty recognizable
• [Serbian Parliament] a nice traditional building, was featured in Half-Life 2
• [The Name of Mary Church] not impressive per say but it's my favourite church in my city and I'm always in awe of it
Basically most of it is religious buildings, but very old or very big religious buildings
Edit: After checking Saint Savas Cathedral is the fourth largest Orthodox Church so far, but it's still an important piece of architecture and one of the biggest churches
Sava's Church in Belgrade
Kalemegdan, probably
I like how you can just walk in there, see things that were around during the 2nd century, walk a bit further, then see Yugoslavian artillery from WW2
Wow TIL im Swedish
Sorry to ask but why
Is it due to culture or you're supposed to not say hi to your neighbors or
We're very social, I would say even a little bit too social sometimes
But evading neighbours is mind blowing
The plastic bags and the ice cream box full of sarma is a thing here too
Jesus fuck we Slavs
Is this like personal attack or something
German is for me i don't know what it is language just sounds badass
Mine is Russian
Ah well thanks for that but he's Croatian and to strangers it sounds the same, but i agree Serbo-Croatian can sound badass as well
when Lindemann sings, I suddenly start thinking German is the best language in the world hahaha
To be honest i never watched that show, should i?
As a Community fan im familiar with that feeling of "will they do next season or won't they"
Don't talk shit about Greece and Romania, also Croatia only we can do that
I really think people, especially in more Western countries, should leave Romania (especially it's Gastarbaiter communities) the fuck alone with this whole "They're thieves, scammers and beggars" stereotype
I mean, there's good and bad apples everywhere, in every shape, way or form, sure, but even jokingly branding an entire nation of people, just looking to work abroad and make their own lives easier something negative and looking down on them by sheer default of being is really pushing my buttons quite hard
&#x200B;
Also, the opinion that people from Albania are all somehow criminally affiliated backwards hillsmen
*Please, stop
Russia - Politics is debatable, but the whole 'anything which has any loose correlation to Russia is used for spying' got a little boring tbh
Greece - Their economy was problematic a few years back, but they're nice people, and have great food and even better holiday resorts
Romania - First off, Romanians aren't gypsies
A large majority of them are hard working and honest people
Iran - The US is the only one to be blamed for the shit they're currently going through, from Islamism to the near-war situations
When I was in Italy everyone I was with did the hand thing as a joke (not to Italians of course but between each other)
I GET IT ITS A FUNNY STEREOTYPE NOW STOP IT
i don't like it when people demean the Balkans
only the Balkans are allowed to do that
you got a loicence for that opinion
Oh and another country I wanted to mention was Ireland
You got fucked over by the British hard, and still aren't free to this day
But 'hur dur lucky charms', 'drunk irish people', 'IRA 'terrorism''
I've sent two requests for my language to be a paet of Duolingo's courses, and two applications for working on it
There is still no sign of Serbia language :/
What about alcohol then
Shouldnt that be a better contender
because pretty much everyone here drinks, so they're looking at their ass first
Alcohol is OBJECTIVELY more dangerous than cigarettes, but hey everyone here likes a sip of beer/wine so yeah
I'm not a smoker, for the record
Not to mention that having simple things banned results in criminal activity and all kinds of shit
Look at weed and the usa, simple stuff really
I want state control over everything, some kind of regulation
Oh, and some other state, not mine lol
I can't tell the difference between trash and the sidewalk

There were a lot of Spanish soap operas every single day on almost every channel

Let's see
I hate stereotype that we are war endorsing genocidal maniacs
I find funny the stereotype that we are lazy heavy drinking womanizers
Hrvati ustaše, Srbi četnici, Bosanci glupi, Crnogorci lenji, Bugari izdajice, Albanci kozojebi, Slovenci bečki konjušari itd
We have a saying "puši kao Turčin" = "smoking like a Turkish".
Bulgarian backstabbers (Balkan wars, WW1)
Slovenes are Vienna horse grooms (always subjects to Austrians)
Izdajice means traitors
Milunka Savić - most military awarded woman in world i think that says enough
Stevan Sindjelić - vojvoda from first Serbian uprising a true madlad, when he saw he couldn't win the battle he blew himself up and killing 10 thousand Turks with him
King Peter I - he freed all Serbs from Turks won a war against Bulgaria won ww1 and created Yugoslavia
Many more as well just don't have time to name them all
> Dugovics Titusz
Titus Dugovic in our language, i know about him, he's theorized to maybe being Serbian in origin if he even existed
Without a doubt he is, i love stories of distinguished people in epic battles

Also one great grandfather fought in WW1 for Austro-Hungary I believe, I think he was sent to the Italian front
I also have some relatives that were Chetniks/partisans in WW2
It could be said that there was some ground work for potentially doing that in mid 14th century
Our first emperor who ruled at that time conquered large part of ERE lands in the Balkans before he was proclaimed emperor, so when time of coronation came official title that he adopted was "Emperor and autocrat of Serbs and Romans". Not a claim to the Roman Empire per se, though not far from it
Nothing spectacular came from it though, next emperor (his son) was also the last
After his death empire was broken appart and digested piece by piece by the Ottomans
Once for a brief time
I don't know if it counts but the Serbian Empire fashioned itself the successor to the Eastern Roman Empire (while it still existed)
Emperor and autocrat of the Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians and Albanians, not Romans
I think he also had plans to conquer Constantinople and become the succesor of the Byzantine empire
Official title was changed from time to time, and different names were used by different people
What I was referring to was version in Greek at the time of his coronation: "Basileus and autokratōr of Serbia and of Romania". To be more precise it ment "of Roman lands" instead "of Romans".

He was really popular in Serbia too, along with Modesty Blaze, Mandrake, Tin-Tin etc
Slučajno is a word in Serbian, but the meaning is more like accidental
Random would be nasumično/насумично/ nasumichno
It's really fascinating how similar in some aspects Slavic languages are, and yet diverge in others
Fucking taxis
This goes for Belgrade too
Also, there are people asking for money for medicine
It is medicine, I mean, everything that you wish could be medicine, but they want your money for psychodelic ones
We have universal healthcare prescription drugs that are usually affordable
There are some expensive ones, but nobody will beg on streets for it
Literally everything its trash
Szekely goulash from Hungary, made of pork and sauerkraut,  it's amazing
Similar, but with much less liquid
Not sure about flags that arent appreciated
But most people dont know about an old symbol of the serbian people, a boar with an arrow to its forehead
I personally like it a lot because its more unique than the byzantine inspired two head birdy boi we have now
Our very first flag was french flag rotated 90 degrees
Everyone preasured Serbia tu abolish it (along side one of the most liberal constitution for that time)
Maybe the Yugoslav one, but more contraversial than anything
For me and a lot of people it is communist yugoslav flag
You forgot the flag from the Government of National Salvation (also known as Nedić's Serbia)
It was the flag the collaborationists used during the 2
World War
There are different opinions about Milan Nedić, for some he is a hero because he helped a lot of Serbian refugees cross into Serbia to escape murder from the Independent State of Croatia, to some he is a traitor for working with the Germans
But the flag remains controversial and only gets proudly presented from Neo-Nazi, Ultranationalist, etc
groups
Wasnt his flag just a swastika
Nope, Serbian tricolor with the 'square' eagle
I ask them what thay want me to say and its pretty awkward
I've straight up recited the old socialist Yugoslavia anthem and other old socialist phrases, several tongue twisters, and even quoted Jules Verne in French just to screw with people
Здраво, како си? Means hello, how are you in Serbian
Zdravo
In literally means Healthy and Hello
So I'm wishing someone a good health every time I greet them
Three thousand three hundred thirty three

Lmao this same exact thing happened in my home as well
If I try fast then it's a no go but slowly I can
It's really similar to Croatian, and I'm good with that language
Umm
So, Albania/"Kosovo", only solution I see is a one country two systems type approach on Kosovo (like Hong Kong), or us re annexing Kosovo
Croatia for the Yugo wars and the Ustashe, no idea how we could solve this, although I know the first step would be Croatia recognising operation storm as a genocide as it was
Bosnia for Yugo wars, again don't know but the first step is retards over here stopping denying Srebernica
Turkey for Ottoman Empire, no idea why it still is a grievance now
Bulgaria for back stabbing in second Balkan war and WW1, again don't know why this is still an issue it was a long time ago
US for the bombings, no idea how it can be fixed but first step is persecuting Clinton and his helpers for the illegal use of depleted uranium
Montenegro, shitload of retards here (and there) think Montenegro should be part of Serbia, we could fix it by finally agreeing if we are seperate or not
PATHETIC
We have a grudge with every country in eastern Europe (except maybe Russia) and more
How the fuck have we been found it when we were under Byzantium and the Ottomans for 1000 years of the 1400 years we've been in the Balkans
["Čoveče ne ljuti se" \(Don't be angry, man\)]

soo, nothing interesting really
Well, you should define big
I don't think any western European knows any city other than Belgrade and (maybe) Novi Sad
Balkaners know a few more and EX - Yugoslavs probably know most of them

That we smoke alot, i think that we are the country with the most smokers in Europe
We do have beautiful women
I don’t know if we have stereotypes
Are we you
We almost hate people who pay taxes, even ourselves, since we have a feeling that money is being used against us
Which is partly true
You might try herbal
Menta is perfect, I like it cold, camomile is also very nice
We have culture of herbal teas so we use tens of different herbs for tea, but those two are most usual
Winter savory and wild thyme are my favorites
We see it as negative, especially for social events, even public social events as concerts
If dinner at your friends place is at 8pm itvis not polite to be there before 8:30 9 even
It is seen as negative because of the anger  and stress it produces when not being precise on time
In business, not so much but it creates much less tension and problems than in Germany
If you are meeting with someone for the first time, it would be really advisable  to be right on time
If other person told you specifically to be on time, you should do it
Other than that 15-20 minutes is not even worth mentioning
Actually, it is even better to be 15 minutes late so you don't create pressure on others to be on time
North of Europe doesn't  have AC, we on south started having them 20 years ago
But central AC is rare, only newer bussines buildings have it, you can see window units everywhere
Yeah same here

Always fridge, never seen anyone leave them outside
In Serbian it's feminine lol
not pizza imo but I'd definitely try that
I think i've seen it at a pizzeria but I didn't know what it was
I think what people don't get is that, while the Nordic countries are *not* socialist, those systems they have today were *built* by socialists and by people who identified as socialists - [Olof Palme called himself a democratic socialist] and it was for a reason: the idea behind democratic socialism and traditional social democracy (that is, at least until the 1970s-1990s) was achieving socialism **gradually**, through piecemeal reforms, and that is still considered the vague ideal today (and I say vague because, all social democratic parties today still retain the goal of "achieving a socialist society" but they do not appear to *actually* be committed to it other than in words)
My point is that I think that's what Bernie and AOC see themselves as, and that's why they identify as democratic socialists
They are perfectly in line with the European social democratic tradition
European social democrats historically identified as socialists and the parties today still identify as democratic socialist in their party constitutions and talk about overcoming capitalism
But 1) that's set as a long term goal, meaning they don't focus on it; 2) their commitment to it appears to be vague
Besides that, there's also ideas like [ethical socialism] and [liberal socialism] that don't even necessitate introducing public ownership over the means of production
That appears to be what social democratic parties mean when they call themselves socialist today, too - that's what the "Socialists" in Party of European Socialists means, for instance
Rather than advocating Marxian socialism, they will advocate "taming capitalism", "introducing a mixed economy instead", "a society based on cooperation, social justice, altruism" and so on
TL;DR Socialism is a much more complicated concept than most think, social democrats historically identified as socialists and many of them, as well as their parties, still identify as socialists today, the reason being they advocate for instating socialism gradually through piecemeal reforms, or they have a different conception of socialism altogether
Couple of times Hollywood tried to portray us, they usually made us look and act basically like discount Russians
We are more like what a child of a Russian and an Italian would be like
Slavs in most stuff, yes, but also talkative, expressive, touchy and family/honor obsessed in general
Plus we're a country of generally nice weather
In every movie  we are either whores, or gangstas or war criminals, violent, poor, stupid

Somehow we are always the bad guys
Is it because you live in the Eiffel Tower
It's currently so fricking cold here I'm freezing
And like 3 days ago it was very hot
I don't get our climate
Our autumns and springs got totally fucked up in the past few years
Remember that most of october we had april-like temperatures this year
I learned when I was 6 or 7, and before that I was riding it with those extra 2 wheels
I don't think I've ever met a person who can't ride it
When I was like 4 or 5
My younger brother had already known how to ride bike, and I was so ashamed that I couldn't ride it and he could
So I took his bike and in an esplanade I started riding it like crazy and I thought to myself "HA, see, I can ride this thing
" But then, I had to stop the thing, and I didn't know how so I just fell over humiliating myself
Country checks out
A game where you are Grand Prince of Rascia Stefan Nemanja trying to unite divided Serbian states into one to fight against Byzantines, Bulgarians and Hungarians
Also Stephen the tall and Djuradj Brankovic they were pretty important to 15th century Balance history
Totally not
We call bulgarians gypsys and sometimes romanians,we call bosniaks turks,croats ustase and slovenians gay
Usually if they want to get really offensive, they call Croats, catholic Serbs, and bosnikas, Muslim Serbs
Those are the best for starting a brawl
I think every nation uses that for someone lol
So the town of Kecskemét is 'town of goats' in literal translation or something similar
Gypsys,but in Serbia a lot of people love bulgarians
yes
No shit Sherlock
Well, the question was not what are your neighbors but what you call them, my Alpine Serb cousin
Here it is taught quite a bit
Events that lead to the war and, blitzkrieg, operation barbarosa, pearl harbour and the pacific theatre(not a lot), some African battles, defeat of Italy, defeat of Germany( that's where it ends for us) and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
And we also learn as much about the war in our country
Essentially it picks up where we left of in the previous lessons (interwar Yugoslavia, Hitler's rise to power and Mussolini in Italy)
A lot of it is learning about the Holocaust and the genocide against Serbs in Croatia
Yugoslav civil war and the big battles like Stalingrad and the landing in Normandy
But the focus is as I said, the Holocaust
We learn about NDH and how thay commited genocide,and we learn that yugoslavia was also in civil war between ustase chetniks and partizans
Yea same for me,but we learned more about atrocities committed by nazis and ustase
i mean i learned
The part where we were an Empire
Granted they have plenty to be proud for but they're proud for all the wrong reasons
Battle of Kosovo 1389 its overly romanticised in our history
The [Serbian Empire] existed for 25 years during the 14th century during the late and failing Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty
Fell apart into many warring states shortly after
[Moravian Serbia] the strongest of the petty states that emerged from the Serbian Empire
Fought the [Battle of Kosovo] in 1389, there's a whole mythology centered around that - heroic sacrifice, betrayal, shielding the West against Islam etc
The [Serbian Despotate] that succeeded it is sometimes romanticised as a Renaissance state
This is stronger among more civic nationalist leaning people
After that we learn about the hajduks, which are Serbian brigands
They're heavily whitewashed and seen as freedom fighters, mostly because many of them did join the [First Serbian Uprising] in 1804
The leader of the uprising, Karađorđe, is mostly seen as a symbol of uncompromising rebellion, while Miloš Obrenović who secured the gains they made during the Second Serbian Uprising is seen as more cunning and diplomatic
Both are somewhat romanticised but by different types of nationalists
The 19th century and the Obrenović dynasty in general (as well as their allies such as Jovan Ristić) are more often romanticised by pro-Western liberal conservatives such as Latinka Perović, Dubravka Stojanović, Čeda Antić etc
Their opposition often personified in Nikola Pašić as well as the Karađorđević dynasty are more often romanticized by pro-Russian populists
Some call the period of their total domination in politics after suffrage was significantly expanded from 1903 to 1914 the Golden Age of Serbian Democracy
World War 1 is, contrary to Western European states, also seen as just and glorious
The Kingdom of Yugoslavia is sort of niche, but fascists like the Bogomoljački Pokret set up by Nikolaj Velimirović and the fascist Zbor party led by Dimitrije Ljotić during this period
King Aleksandar is liked by some conservatives but is rarely idealized in contemporary politics, I'd say
I think this is changing with films like Montevideo coming out and the current President Aleksandar Vučić trying to whitewash the fascist leaning Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović.
There's a niche of left wing populists that romanticise Leka Ranković and Krcun, two communist leaders who had Serbian nationalist leanings
Until recently, these same people would be the ones defending Slobodan Milošević, but I see fascists try to co-opt him more often than before
In Serbia Yugoslavia and Tito

Even though Serbian despotate is far more worthy of the praise, but it was tiny and nationalist need to overcompensate
That doesn't look so bad tbh
Duisburg really is depressing
Idk man, compared to all the cities around it, Duisburg does seem kinda bland and unkempt
Although its one redeeming factor (that I noticed at least) is a cool nerdy shop in front of the train station where I bought a Jango Fett action figure
Store clerk was pretty cool too
Someone picked my pocket for the equivalent of 5 cents one time
The only thing even remotely criminal that ever happened to me was that someone took my gloves at uni a few years ago when I forgot them on a lobby chair
my phone was stolen
Never had I been a target of a crime, but my parents were
Thieves stole their cauldron from rakija still
The police caught the guys, but the cauldron was smashed and sold as used copper for scrap metal
They bought another one so that factory of happyness could work uninterupted
I know the guy, and I will get my revenge sooner or later
This happened ten years ago, but that was a good cauldron
Hahahahahahahaha I knew chalga is inspired by our turbo folk but Sen Trope is a straight up copy
In Serbia ita 'отаџбина' (otadžbina) literally means home land
Every serbian youtuber is kid manipulating basterd,i only watch Ozbiljne teme
Not really, he has a British bias
Oh and he doesn't believe in climate change, that's when I stopped watching
Not just men, but women and children too
We also have this custom of three kisses for acquaintances and distant family members, but not with close family
It's usually performed when there is a host and guest role involved, such as family dinner, arrival of someone or birthdays, weddings and funerals
Three has a great symbolic meaning, like Holly trinity, third time's a charm, three wise men, probably even more in prechristian period, but two not so much
Plus, in Serbian culture, we use it to distinct ourselves from our catholic neighbors, because orthodox christians cross themselves with three fingers, not five, even though Serbian society isn't that much religious, like it used to be
I love both but cats are more laidback and lazy like me so I can just procrastinate the whole day with a partner
But the majority of people in Serbia definetly prefers dogs
Besides Serbian and it's sister languages (Croatian, Bosnian and montenigran), regional official are Hungarian, Slovak, Ruthenian and albanian, and on local level Romanian, Czech, German, Bulgarian, Romani
The most unknown language is Vlach language (romanian eith a lot of serbian influence)
There is Wallachian language spoken by people in Eastern Serbia and it's similar to Romanian
Wallachian people are usually Serbs with Romanian origin and they're using both serbian and romanian language
I'm serbian but I have to pick Athens
Not only for the balkans but possibly for the whole world
As I understood some time ago only one country is always considered as part of Balkan, whether just geographically l, politically or by mentality and it is Serbia
Everyone else has a way out
Sometimes I have a feeling that "Balkan" is jusy politically correct way to say "Serbia". Like "Balkan is bad and agressive and poor".
We use a card or cash, but there's a special trick
Most of the money doesn't go to the public transport company so all the money is pumped out of the system and everything is shit
I think we have discovered the best way of running things, legalised crime is the way to go
You people pay
Here it's free as long as they don't catch you
We say "ptičica" which means "little bird". Some use "sir" influenced by English "cheese".
The mosquitoes seem to be retreating slowly
finally
We had the worst June in the history of mosquitoes here, even far from rivers and in the city (because the month was a combination of very hot weather and weekly heavy rains)
It felt like living in a tropic country for some time

Very constructive visit by Macron
There might not be a war again in Kosovo
Novak Djoković won wimbledon
Glad to hear that, wish all best to Finns and Finland in future
What were the tweets about
He did, and he even sounded quite good
For me it's much more impressive than Putin only saying a couple of words in Serbian during his visit even though there were more people present and Serbian is somewhat similar to Russian
He did yes, and he did it surprisingly well, although he was reading a phonetic text, still huge of him to give such effort
Congrats to you as well, Halep did a good job :D
Wasn't talking about what he said, he signed some pretty important stuff, that can't be re-arranged in a week
In WW1 Serbia's losses were more than 25% of entire population
France is 10th in the world by plum production
Oh, pardon
My (Serbian) friend once stayed in German hospital and they used to bring him food, meat and whatnot, without bread which is off course the worst thing that can happen to a person
So when he asked for bread they  started adding it to absolutely every meal, even to pizza and pasta
Argue with the Balkan countries all night until we get tipsy then we're best friends and we start dancing
Now, listen here, everybody knows who makes the best burek and sweets in Balkans
Don't you try to wiggle your way out of it
You could keep your raki for yourself and enjoy in our glorious rakija as long as you want
Hey, it's our turn anyway
Others could have even number world wars, odd ones are ours
Well you did war with Bulgaria and Turkey :P
Hungary is a Balkan country
I meant that Albanians and Gorani people makes the best burek, icecream and sweets by far
Also, what did you say about rakija
FYI, only slivowitz is collored by oak barrels
There is no place like home
Welcome
Indeed but you asked 'did we ever had a problem' :D not if you currently have a problem
Even we are good with Bulgaria now and we had a milenium of wars lol
We make rakija with almost any fruit
Šljivovica means from plum, šljiva - plum
Other notable ones are made of apricot, william pear and quince
Some lesser known are made of special kind of peach, vineyard peach, apple, raspberries and there are even ones who tried to made it out of oranges and bananas
There is also widely spread grape rakija - lozovača and komovica, but I think that Serbian made grape rakija are subpar to those made in Montenegro
I think that [Stara sokolova] exports to the US, so you could check it out
No problem, really, glad I could help
The french movie “La Haine” in Belgrade (Yugoslavia) in the late 90s. After the bombing of Belgrade and before the fall of Milosević. Focused on the Belgrade youth

We have political scandals every day and celebrities usually try really hard to put their scandals to newspapers so everyone can see
The biggest one currently is about Marijuana plantation that was under the protection of current government official
We have one about defense minister's dad selling weapons on black market or the one about president being tapped
Honestly there are lots of those around
There is one about famous singer cheating her footballer husband with another, younger footballer
Racy videos and pictures that she was sending to her lover were all around the gossip print and the internet
But we all believe she sent all of those to the press by herself
Her career and public image exploded after that
She is still with her husband and more famous than ever
Yeah
We usually like to say that we are a criminal clan masquerading as a country
The name "Magna Carta" is short for "Magna Carta Libertatum", which is in Latin and probably why your spell check corrected it to "Carter". The English translation would be "The Great Charter" or "The Great Charter of Liberties", which I've honestly never seen in use

Belgrade (1
7m) - the most diverse place, a lot of history, friendly people, great food, and according to Lonely Planet, the best nightlife in the world
I'm glad more and more people are discovering Belgrade and Serbia each year
Some people do have the superiority complex, unfortunately
Novi Sad (350k) - visually more pleasing than Belgrade, home to one of Europe's most famous festivals, Exit
Their stereotype/joke is that they are gay; they are the most left-wing and LGBT-friendly city in Serbia
Niš - a bit poorer than BG and NS, historically important for both Serbia and the Byzantine Empire
It's known as The Emperor's City, since a lot of Roman emperors were born here, the most famous of which being Constantine the Great
I commend your use of /s because I hate people who use it but I feel it was very much required here

Yeah, Wilhelm = виљем (viljem)
We mostly use the same names but spell them differently
Exception is in older history where we serbizate some names
Per example - (Landless) John - Jovan (Bez Zemlje)
If it’s a name that has a Serbian version, in same situations we use ours
John - Jovan, Michael - Mihajlo, Mark - Marko, Elizabeth - Elizabeta etc
Vilhelm is also correct
That is just a phonetically adjusted foreign name, we use the same principle everywhere
Better examples here are: John Lackland - Jovan Bez Zemlje, Queen Elizabeth - Kraljica Elizabeta etc
Corrected
Well those have to be translated nonetheless
Those are basically foreign words that form a name
But yeah, it’s hella funny
Iran is so beautiful,historical buildings,nature and nice and friendly people
Just the Balkans in general
All of the Balkans
To this day, when talking to foreigners or anyone from the outside, after a while people get semi taken aback when you talk of your home favorably or show any sign of, well, *normality as a person
* I know it's nobody's fault, but, Jesus Christ, goes to prove just how much of an ingrained stigma still exists around this place
I once had someone amazed, for example, by how beautiful Croatia's seaside was

He would also attack servants and run until exhausted, wailing that he was threatened by his enemies

From the collapse of the ussr country went to shit and he somewhat rebuilt it
the rape and murder of Tijana Jurić, a 15 year old girl from Vojvodina in 2014
It got a lot of media coverage, and few years later, the national assembly passed the law that introduced the institution of life sentence in our country’s criminal law
There are of course dozen from the 90’s, one of the most famous is  the murder of the journalist Slavko Ćuruvija who got killled in 1999, but until 2019, no one was charged for the murder

Plural: хвала вам
Singular: хвала ти
We can have anyone as subject and anyone as indirect object
Hvala - thanks
Hvala ti/mu/vam/Vam/im - thank you/him/you (plural)/you (formal)
Zahvaljujem se, zahvaljuješ se, zahvaljuje se, zahvaljujemo se, zahvaljujete se, zahvaljuju se - I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they thank someone
We can also change it through tenses
You misunderstood the question
It's asking whether your language has a saying for you thanking someone, in the name of your group
Yes
In Serbo-Croatian, *hvala* can also mean *praise*, although it's a bit archaic
However, there are plenty of derivatives with that meaning that are common today, like *pohvaliti (to praise/commend)* or *vredno hvale (worthy of praise)*.
It can get confusing if you're not a native speaker:
*Pohvaliti* - *to commend*
*Zahvaliti* - *to say thanks*

Kosovo is independent
The most offensive thing u can say to a Serb in my opinion
Do I need to say anything
Honestly if I ever go to the Netherlands I'd mostly want to see Friesland and not just because I have friends there
Both really, could be argued that Slovenia is Balkan based on history and culture beside geographic position
I live in Vojvodina, north Serbia which is not part of the Balkan peninsula but it never offends me when people say we are
Because nearly all of Serbian history included Kosovo in it
And because we have many, many churches on Kosovo
Because Albanians were crushing our crosses on Kosovo, stolen it from us
It got under 100 recently
More countries are on our side not recognizing Kosovo
It doesn't mean we have beef with them, but it certainly doesn't improve our relations
To be honest Serbians know very little about the Netherlands and I'm sure the Dutch don't know much about us either
I'm more of the person who avoids capital cities
Capital cities to me are like huge commercials that promote stereotypes for the country, I feel I'd get a more authentic experience if I visited Leeuwarden for instance just like how I wish people would visit Novi Sad instead of Belgrade
Similar in Serbian 'slovenačko' for Slovenian and 'slovačko' for Slovak, very confusing
Albanians are all over Kosovo
That's why they want to be independent and form Great Albania
They are doing the same thing to Western Macedonia
Typically they were summarily executed
We killed all of them
I work at an ad agency
We get a shitload of samples from our clients, which mostly translates into as much chocolate as you can eat/as many cigs as you can blast/as much anger as you can take
The company itself provides the laptops, phones, drinks, and taxi cards to drive around free of charge
They also pay for an occasional conference or two, but that's pretty much it
There are also mandatory benefits, like health and pension plans, but those are state-governed, so they're nothing special
Not getting fired
The only Serbo-Croatian example I can think of for now is "uspravio". It's a verb meaning "to erect", but it's conjugated and specifically refers to a singular male being/thing in the past tense
It's not in the infinitive form (which would be "uspraviti") so you won't find it in a dictionary
Where's the "e"?
This was the closest I could do  I'd love it if you could provide a better example

For Serbia, it has to be the Battle of Kosovo in 1389
The Ottoman Empire, although suffering heavy casualties and losing its Sultan in the battle, managed to defeat and conquer Serbia
The ensuing five horrible centuries under the Ottoman rule and the Kosovo Legend, the main Serbian nation-building myth, are probably the most important elements of the Serbian national identity
Today, more than 600 years later, the Battle of Kosovo still has a huge impact on political decisions and moral and religious attitudes in Serbia
For us it is a battle on Kosovo in 1389 against Ottoman Empire
Then the WWI and WWII of course
The battle of Kosovo was a stalemate, and I'd say the battle of Maritsa hit us harder
Still an important battle nonetheless
I had to look it up - we eat this all the time but made with milk and sugar

We eat a lot of bread
Being afraid of cold drafts, even when it's 40 degrees Celsius
Edit: Wait, English native speakers, is it draft or draught
Google tells me both are possible, I was taught draft is correct
English language and literature student asking
Voting for Vučić.
Can confirm
I fucking love bread
Eating something without it would feel like I haven't eaten at all
We do that also
And if you come to someones house we will feed you, and give you drinks till you burst
you can't explain it
Alcohol makes most people feel happier and more open to socializing, not really a mystery
I started reading this expecting it would refer to a teenage birthday party, then I got to the authority complains part and I wasn't sure anymore
Here in Serbia we actually call it 'luftirati', with the root German word Luft
Yeah, but it's not as disastrous as people say it is
Old ladies here think you can get meningitis, pneumonia, kidney cold (may or may not be a completely made-up condition) and so on
On the other hand, my cousin who lives in Sweden told me people there don't even blow dry their hair in winter and they just go out with wet hair after a swim or a bath, without freezing to death or having even a minor cold
Your flair confuses me
Are you an American of Serbian and Italian origin
Or an American who lived/lives in Serbia and/or Italy
Interesting
'Promaja' doesn't have its verb form here, only 'napraviti promaju' so I guess we just use 'luftirati' as a short version for that
Great
It's nice to be in touch with your roots
Greetings from Serbia
Greece, to be fair we did share a border until relatively recently historically speaking
Greece for sure
Curious as to why
Actually Kingdom of Serbia - Kingdom of Yugoslavia
Before that it was in the medieval times and while you may not think that East Rome is todays Greece the same people lived there
That is indeed very interesting, i had no idea it was that important to you, i mean it is to us (there was considerable hype around Zeman and his criticizing of the Kosovo debacle), so i just thought our media overblew it lol
And yeah, the recognition of Kosovo has tarnished many longstanding relations, but im curious why didn't Slovakia buckle but Czech Republic did
I also know that when Czech filmmakers went to Madeline Albrights media campaign and showed her some pictures, she called them disgusting Serbs lol
You sound like a really nice person
Just wanted to tell you
I love it i was everywhere:budva,herceg novi,tivat,ulcinj
Herceg Novi is my favorite
Been there skiing,i didn’t like it
I was visiting Skadar and it was amazing experience
Been somewhere with my family it was nice
I was in Trebinje for a wedding nice place
I like the people
Amazing country one of the most beautiful i been to
Szekely Land
There are a *lot* of stray dogs over here, there are 3 dogs next to a local school
Blue 100% people would either have only blue pencils or pencils with all the colors (red, black, green
Nobody is against black blue is just more common
Depends, some parties have places where parents can sit and chat other times they just drop off the kid
Usually it's told in advance I think
Free sandwich
Bread, margarine, sausage
Serbia is really centralised coutry, literally every institution is seated in Belgrade
Also, ~1
5 - 2 out of ~6
5 million people live there
Smart
Eagles fly young, or in Serbian, "Orlovi rano lete". It was a children's book, and it was not hard in a way that it's not understandable, but it was hard because of the subjects it touched
For me is "Na Drini ćuprija" ("The bridge on Drina")  by Ivo Andrić
Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot
Wtf is even happening there, I will never know
When I have red the book I came to conclusion that I should have probably use some psychotropic substance for better understanding
> niewiasta
Can this word be used to mean bride, like in Serbian nevesta
> białogłowa
Is this literally whitehead female
Gospodar is master here, someone who owns something, whole gost is guest too
That Germans were unpleasant and cold
I visited several places, and honestly, everywhere I went people were very polite and helpful
I had a great time, would love to go again
Paris isn't a complete shithole as some media I used to follow made it up to be
Icelandic
I really like it and would like to learn it
I’m not exactly sure on this but I think it’s closest to Old Norse along with Faroe
Definitely Swedish, it sounds almost like a song at times
"Prva" which means "First". That's the most watched one
Although the first and national TV channel is "RTS" (Radio Televizija Srbije - Radio Television of Serbia)
I thought that everyone learns Serbian,as we here learn English and German/French/Russian
Sike no one learns Serbian
SIKE I feel like god explaining Serbian to random Americans on discord
>Serbia wrapped around Macedonia and bordered Greece in the west
Soon
>hasn't even existed in my lifespan
It technically existed until 2003
It was named Yugoslavia until 2003 and Serbia and Montenegro from 2003 to 2006
No it certanly is not
Everyone just minds their own business, no one cares
It really is
I was there twice, I've never seen a person eating and walking, except occasional tourists (and even that was rare)
One of the reasons it's considered rude is because it might inconvenient other people
Well, be it food truck or street vendor or festival, there is usually some kind of designated place where you can sit or stand while eating
Or you can get (heated and surprisingly good) food in konbinis (supermarkets) and eat it there
I knew it was Bismarck before clicking the link lmao
Depends on what ya mean by Supreme court
If ya mean by a court that controls the legality of legal acts and if an act is in line with the constitution then yes we do have it called the Constituonal court
You go to that court when you used all of your regular legal remedies in a case and they ONLY check the legality and whether it doesnt offend the constitution
It has 15 judges who different organs of law recommend the candidates
5 are recommended by the Parlament, 5 the prez and 5 the supreme court of cassation (which I will go to in a sec)
In our law the Constitutional court is treated as something different and not a regular court, but a whole different entity hence ya can only go there when you used up all of yer legal remedies
If ya mean the highest court to try someone in a criminal, civil, familiar and so on then it's the " Supreme court of cassation". Weird name I know
It's the last court you can appeal to using legal remedies (the constitutional court before is a whole different entity here) here
It also has other jurisdictions, like it can decide what court has the right to a case (in an instance a man lives in town A but he dies I  town B the two courts there cant decide who has the right to start the hereditary process so they ask the supreme cassation court to decide for them)
It has a president who the parlament chooses but it does not recommend the candidates, that right belongs to a seperate entity called the high judicial council which also chooses the number of judges and the parlament just picks them to be the judges
The number of judges there varies and currently there are 45 high cassational judges and the president of it
The pres has a mandate of 5 years and CANNOT be re elected again
Hope this finds ya interesting
Roki Vulovic
Alphaville also, and ofcourse Nena
And sabaton
Ah the late 2000s-very early 2010s nostalgia trip, here we go
Stereo Love came out in 2009 and it's nostalgic as fuck for me
Inna has been around even longer
I know this one in Serbo-Croatian hladna pička means cold pussy while in Czech-Slovak-Polish it means cold drink
yeah, but it also means punishing
which says a lot about our style in fucking i guess
So slavorum lied to me
Very popular
For example in veterinary ambulance i work in, there are 8 male workers including me
6 of us have beards
Well i don't know, but the two doctors that work are clean shaven
All of our technicians wear beards
Plus me and one more guy that work in online pet shop that is part of ourd let's call it company,wear it
I was like clean shaven up until like three weeks ago, but i decided to grow my beard back
Czech and Russian, i'm not sure why, they just sound so pleasing
i get an orgasm whenever i hear russian or french
German and Russian
I just like both languages
I love it when someone speaks one of those
German and Russian sound cool to me
a Pole said to me that he considers Gavrilo Prinicip a hero dont know how Germans and Austrians gonna feel about him tho
The only people that come to mind are exactly why we shouldn't answer this one
To be honest everyone was working against Hungary in the 1848 revolutions
Hajduci
We had them in Serbia too, we also had uskoci which were like hajduci but instead of going backt to a forest to hide from the Turks they would retreat to a neighbouring country and wait a little before striking again
In Serbia hajduci are very well known, I always thought it was our thing, but I guess everyone did it
Probably 626
It would suck and i would die but i wanna see if we lived on Balkan peninsula or we are Immigrants like other nations
And the EU didn't learn from that
You're still called racist if you dare to be critical
Only one
Even that was late to come here
Only one
Only one :(
We have 1 in whole Serbia
One so far in Belgrade
I hear they're building another one
I didn't even know there were any in Serbia
Is it in Belgrade
Yeah, there's even a bus that uses it as a turntable
Balkans, but then everyone disagrees if that's East or South europe
Balkans, the place where most of shit happenes
That and Southeast Europe
(although a very small minority would disagree, those would say we are Central Europe)
I'd say Montenegro is fairly Central African, maybe a little bit of Western African because you're tall
I think east of Germany is eastern Europe, but below the top of Italy is south europe so South east europe
Fair enough
Do you take off your shoes when you enter your home
It's the first thing I do when I enter my house
I saw on the internet and with my own eyes that some people never take off their shoes inside
What are they, savages
Yes, of course
Always
I didn't generalise people here, I was just wondering if people take off their shoes or not
Of course it varies, there isn't a single country where all people take them off or don't. I also had no idea this was asked here before
No, they don't take their shoes off
Same here, it's my first instinct whenever I walk through a front door, whether I enter my house or someone else's.
I'd say  [Pogledaj dom svoj andjele] though it's universal
All people from all countries in the world can/could find themselves in it at some point in their history, the relevance for Serbia is that it predicted what would happen in the next 30 years
The one that more people would probably agree with would be  [Tamo daleko]
Wow, Welsh is really a beautiful language i can see why you preserved it despite the circumstances
Wow, Welsh is really a beautiful language i can see why you preserved it despite the circumstances
First time hearing this and its really nice, guess Yugoslavs make hell of a good war music
When you hunt it, you eat it usually
I've never seen someone order rabbit meat in a restaurant
I'd say its pretty common to hunt rabbits and eat them here in Serbia
I think rabbit is common if you have a hunter in your family
I had everything on your list and it's completely normal as far as I know
But it's not common as in most people eat various meat all the time (except hunters), but then again nobody will think of it as anything out of the ordinary
I hope you understand what I mean :)
yeah, its not something you eat everyday, but if you say you ate rabbit no one will find it weird
Underrated reply
Serbia and Montenegro,Serbia and Bosnia
Serbia and Montenegro
Serbia and Montenegro
Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro and B&H are all very similar, same language, similar culture, rakija
And Serbia and Romania are as well surprisingly similar
Leave religion & politics out of the mix and Croatia fits as well
True dat
No, no
Takođe
I love Breton
I'm glad it's doing better
Once all this covid crap is over, I hope to visit Bretagne, it seems like such a lovely region
I can't say much in Breton besides Demat and Kenavo, but I'm slowly learning French
Oh boy, Surinamese is amazing, wish I could have it every day
Gastarbaiters working aborad in the West for a couple of months or so and coming back home and acting like they're Elon Musk all of a sudden just because they spent a season carrying boxes in some random German factory
Lol same here
As someone from Balkan this sounds really scary
I change almost all friends every 5-6 years and keep best few from every batch
It's possible to go have a beer/coffee with almost anyone without even knowing their name and became friends
And I consider myself introvert
We don't even count 15 minutes, it's considered being on time
Only not coming at all is considered a bit rude, but still acceptable
Same here, but it's not big issue for private gatherings since everyone  just counts it in, but is really big issue for public concerts since you might just stand and wait for more than two hours for concert to begin and after you will be late for transportation  home
Ughhh it's a similar situation in Serbia
If you are a guest, the host has to constantly cater to you and watch over you when you eat, to either ask you if everything's good or if you need any more food or drink
It's annoying, just sit down and let's talk, the food is fine
If someonr invites me to come over at 8pm they get unpleasantly surprised if I come before 8:30 and are like "dude
wtf
King Dragutin first got Belgrade as a gift from Austro-Hungarians in 13th century and then it was capital for the first time during the rule of Stefan Lazarević in 15th century, mostly cause relations with Austro-Hungarians were good and Ottomans were a threat on the south so capital had to be as far away as possible
Sorry, my mistake, I didn't translate it well but I was thinking of kingdom of Hungary
Boli me kurac - my dick hurts
Puca mi kurac - my dick is popping (can also be used like this: *snapping fingers* "do you hear that
" "Oh it's my dick
It's popping")
Vrište mi jaja - my balls are screaming
Boli me uvo - my ear hurts
Might I add:
• Zvižde mi jaja - My balls are whistling
• Boli me uvo - My ear hurts
• Puca mi kurac - My dick is exploding(firing, crackling)
Serbia is number one world producer/exporter of raspberries
Vampire is a Serbian word used worldwide
i just read 10 minutes ago half of the raspberries in Sweden are from Serbia
Here you go mate
The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first appearance of the English word vampire (asvampyre) in English from 1734, in a travelogue titled Travels of Three English Gentlemenpublished in The Harleian Miscellany in 1745
[5]Vampires had already been discussed inFrench[6] and German literature
[7] After Austria gained control of northern Serbia andOltenia with the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, officials noted the local practice ofexhuming bodies and "killing vampires".[7]These reports, prepared between 1725 and 1732, received widespread publicity
[7] TheEnglish term was derived (possibly via Frenchvampyre) from the German Vampir, in turn derived in the early 18th century from theSerbian vampir (Serbian Cyrillic: вампир)

If you're referring to Syria I don't think the majority of people in Europe support a regime change
Other than that Catalonia has no right to secede under the  Spanish constitution, therefore going against the constitution is undemocratic
The legal and democratic way to do it is to change the constitution by vote
As for why a majority don't support Catalonia is because Spain is a member of NATO and an EU member and supporting secessionist movements there is counter productive
I was thinking more about the people rather than the governments
Of course NATO countries support the US against Assad
Also if they're against Islam then they're against Syria as a whole then it seems haha
>I am interested in Syrian war since it started and often discuss it on internet and i can say only few people really support Bashar
Really
Because I had the completely opposite experience and see few online who don't support Bashar
Ah well, that's no surprise then
Really no pattern
Its just differnet for most of the names
There are on rules for slavic languages
There is deminutive, yes, but it's usually derived from a nickname already
Othervise, no pattern
Well it doesn't have any rules
For example, Ceca is a nickname for Svetlana
Jan->Honza->Honzík->Honzíček
So it goes Jan-small Jan-even smaller Jan-the smallest Jan
I'm sorry, what
Noo
Macron my dude you are right I really hope our president in Serbia will finally expel all these migrants from our country
They are stealing, burning houses, beating people and everything else, while our president says that they are our friends
Islamists should stay in their countries
There is even a video of some Algerian dude thats saying how they should kill all french people while albanians should kill all Serbs and take our organs
So on a post about protecting peoples rights of expression and the right to believe whatever people want, you suggest banning people from believing in things you don't like
And what could possibly happen without borders, except the massive influx of various terrorist groups that can now roam around the world and cause chaos

It's a warning to not look at the content in a professional workplace environment because it is improper
In a plastic cup, it would be just better for everyone if there were no straws and not pasta straws because there is still some pollution from making pasta
I don't watch sports but this is seriously stupid
She's not
Tax football more
If they can afford to give such ludicrous salaries to individuals, they can be taxed more
dude, she's trying to imply the society treats them as if they are
every single footballer of the Spanish primary league has a minimum 129
000e yearly salary
That's ~10 000e/monthly
That's like 5
5 times more
Even those bench warmers who never get to see the field earn 5
5 times more than scientists who bust their asses of 8 hours a day or more to do work important for the humankind
You think that's ridiculous
Wait until you hear the salaries of the Spanish SECOND league minimum salary - 77
500e/yr or ~6500e monthly
5 times more
How shitty is the reality where scientists working to save lives earn 3
5 times more than someone who is a bench warmer for a Spanish club which is probably spectated by a thousand people when playing home
I wonder how deep we have to go into the leagues and how much of a shitty player you have to be to earn less than an educated scientist
How and when she get there
Bruh
I'm assuming she has stolen a long time ago and she hardly wants to get back to her sisters
It's not even a coping strategy I think people just don't care and never did
But they expect healthcare workers to die with their patients because it's "their job".
I woke up at 11 AM as an European and still don't understand what the fuck is going on
Can someone explain this to me please
It won't be a world war(hopefully)
Thanks
This picture is fascinating
Just imagine what's going through his head at that moment
In front of himself he sees a destroyed, completely decimated and weaker than ever Germany
I bet that what he was seeing was the last thing he thought he would see
Some people probably did something
what a shame
Never did i have a video load up faster
Got em
exactly the same happened in serbia during protest except media wrote "Monsters payed by america won't let ambulance pass".
There is also video of Serbian president who is 2m tall playing basketball with 11 years old kids and always blocking their shoots
He won
[Here is a pic]
I remember Kesić making fun of him for this
Theres also a video on pornhub of him fucking his citizens (not litteraly but metaphorically)
Yeah true
It's obviously a repost lmao this day comes every year
So not much sense at bashing it as a repost
Ahh I see, yeah people should look out if they are reposting when they post something
How dare you, Serbia has the best rakija(and kompletlepinja)

We do beat them in average height
I'm sorry but that looks more like six gorillion protestors
I gotta visit Moscow some day when I start earning money
Other cities in Europe on my list are Athens, Warsaw, London, Paris, Berlin
Yeah, I just remembered some pictures that I've seen of Krakow, the old part of town is beautiful
I know, but the IT sector is ok in Serbia
Oh, yes
I'm also interested in Dusseldorf and its modern architecture
As much as I know, Hamburg also has a really interesting port area and Frankfurt I don't know much of
Maybe it's different for Serbian citizens
I don't really know
People don't generally emigrate if they can stay, and I will try to stay
I like the word "lad". I wish it was used instead of "dude", "bro", "man" etc
You can’t call Serbs great bunch of lads and seperate our province on the map
You sir just lied
American view of Europe: Wait
is this Asia
"yer one" as in my significant other
Yeah, fuck the guy who forced the hystorical car producers to switch to electric, am I right
Yes he did, his cars were already selling in the US way more than in Europe back in 2017/2018
When he managed to build the new car factory in China everyone was like "oh, he wasn't just talking shit", right now the cars made by Tesla in China are all sold even before getting out of the production line
The old car manufacturers were working on prototypes and ideas for electric cars from years, but when Tesla was progressing so fast with the construction of the factory in China and with the numbers of Model 3s being sold in the US, the old manufacturers had to wake up fast, that is why in the last year and a half they pushed so hard for a wide range of electric cars to be available by the end of 2020 and 2021
Also because if they wouldn't have done that now, they would have never catched up with Tesla once their factory in Berlin is completed
I wouldn't say that Musk wants to save earth from global warming, yes some of his ideas and projects are good and will help the environment, but in the end he's there for money
Did you buy it from us (Serbia)
The same goes for Belgrade
Whenever a heavier rain falls, the city is flooded
Yea the gypsy guy is strait fire
Not as much as Messi in Barca tho
There is a far better version, that's actually really well thought out, as in it mimics the bs that the colonizers did in Afrika

It's the same meaning with the words changed
I don't see your point
Yeah you're right
It's a really stupid comment I posted out of annoyance with semantics without a second thought put into it
I regret it now but deleting comments is for cowards
I'll try to put something useful
Oh but also when I said correct position I meant like politically
There is a correct position on a lot of things but politically it's harder to tell
Imagine being such a retard that as a Slavic person you emulate the people that wanted to exterminate your own ethnicity

CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR BROTHERS ️
Oj junaštva svijetlo zoro
Montenegro is free now,lets goooo
I see a lot of shit slinging going Serbian way
Anyway, I was born and spent most of my childhood in Montenegro
This is all personal anecdote but still having friends there and visiting often sentiment is still the same
You see my dad is a military man, that has defended Montenegro from NATO bombing
And how did the country pay him back
By blackmail in 2006
Any military had to vote for sepparation or they were served transfer papers to Serbia
You had no option to stay as you were seen as traitor
Some higher ups could but whatever
A lot of money was offered to vote for sepparation, which is not a conspiracy theory
Dad's friend basically just showed us an envelope full of money
That man is also the one who was a captain on a ship recently found to have been transporting drugs
Referendum day at first it was told Milo lost and I remember my whole school cheering, to have our dreams crushed later
A lot of friendships were forcefully broken up that day
On top of that anyone who happened to be traveling was not allowed to vote and was held up at the border, the same way they forbid Vlado Georgiev, probably most famous musician from Montenegro to enter the country during the vote yesterday
Now I am sure some people were for sepparation, how Montenegro has always had it's own government and Serbia has mostly been hands off
In a year since I left every beach I used to spend summers on in my small town has become Russian or Chinese property, or private property in general
You could no longer take your towel and just enjoy the summer and swim
Shit Milo is saying is ignoring history and making out Montenegro what it is not
Worst of all, all fears of Serbia are unwarranted
We do not want to unite with Montenegro
We already visit just by ID cards, no passports needed, nothing
Anyway f*k you Milo for destroying the country I loved, for ruining the friendships I made and trying to keep me away from my family there
Also the same goes for all your supporters and especially those who have sold their asses for 200 euros you gave them to vote for you yesterday and you still lost
Go rot in prison and hopefully great leader Vucic will follow you there soon
Yes this is amazing
You just got Serbed
There are numerous pro EU parties in the opposition coalition
Really
The party with an Albanian leader is pro-Russian
The pro-EU coalition is pro-Russian
There are definitely pro-Russians in ZBCG but to say that they are all pro Russian is just silly
He basically wanted to strip the biggest church in Montenegro of their property, and not any other religious institution - only the Serbian Church, which basically founded - and led Montenegro in it's inception, centuries ago
This is part of the reason ethnic issues are complicated in Montenegro
People have a very different understanding of what Montenegrin actually is
He tried to suppress a massive (like, historically biggest peaceful protests in MNE) by force, but he failed in many instances, since there were no 'sparks' on the protesters' side
PS the redditor who replied to you first repeated the same Djukanovic camp trope that this property in question was somehow taken from a non-existent Montenegrin church in 1918
It's just a fake history narrative, easily verifiable
Serbian church in Montenegro is like 400 years older than Montenegro itself
As it should be
And that 1918 narrative is a big shame to everyone who actually believes in that bunch of horseshit
Considering what kind of journalists serbia has some of them probably do deserve to be imprisoned for the lies they publish
So journalists don't do crime in rest of the Europe
I know what this map is trying to say, but I am 100% sure it's bullshit
Love the map 10/10
Just 5 in russia
Nice
Ps i like how Kosovo isn't a country here
Clear agenda pushing, isn't this against the rules
Nvm Crimea is Russia not Ukraine
For example like 1-2 years ago one of our newspapers published "trump supports kosovo being part of serbia" and when the white house heard about that bullshit they told them to take it down immediately
I sadly can't find that article anymore
But i do have [This]
Little Russia doing Russian things
Putin might be bad and everything, but Navalny is the most racist piece of shit that could be born
Dont be fooled by all of this
Only 2% of people support Navalny in Russia and that is not enough to make a change
vast majority of russian people like putin
Politically
Needs one more river to become Belgrade
Vikings, chaaarge
this is r/europe not r/unitedstates
As a human I am glad Trump lost but as a Serb now I will look at the US politics more closely now bc Biden has had a hate bonner on us before and I just do not know much on his stance or views on us today
I only know he views us as more stable then before and will work on the stabilization of Prishtina and Belgrade but how is the key
This will probably be better for citizens of the Unated States, as well as EU; but I am honestly scared for my country that is neither of those
Biden might have just been a "lesser evil" now for most of the people, but he is "evil" nonetheless
Kind of scared
In Serbia people hate Biden like the devil
Litteraly everyone hates him
Of course I am
I am from Serbia, and Biden is known for statements such as "all Serbs should be put in Nazi-style concentration camps" and "We should go to Belgrade in Japanese-German style of occupation". Should I feel at peace with his victory
Does most of Finlands population oppose joining NATO
He was the biggest proponent to bomb every Serbian city in the 90s. He said Serbs were dogs who deserved a German style occupation and he was working very hard to achieve that
You have both quotes in these two videos
There is a bevy of similar racist things he said about Serbia if you look for it online
Edit: some more clips:
Here's the occupation talk
Here's the one of him justifying Albania retribution and mass expulsion and terror of Serbs from Kosovo post 1999
Whatever makes you feel special kiddo
The first one is also from 90s as well, though not firmly proven
Allegedly, he states such thing in Senate
Even so, let's say it is not true or that even if it was true, that Biden changed his opinion
But it's hardly the case
His view of Serbs was obvious during his visit in Serbia a couple of years ago (can't precisely recall the year, it was after 2015 though) when he disrespected the flag of the country
It is a small detail, might look insignificant, but clearly shows his opinion of the country, which makes me 80% believe the first statement in my previous comment
Look, I came across those quotes multiple times on the internet over the past years, I didn't "invent" them
Some other guy posted the link to few videos connecting Biden with anti-Serbian sentiment
Jeez
They ended up bombing every city in Serbia btw
Here's the occupation talk
Here's the one of him justifying Albania retribution and mass expulsion and terror of Serbs from Kosovo post 1999
There is much more of similar things
And you might want to do some googling yourself, not expecting everything to be spoon fed to you
Dude
I didn't imply the direct connection between two, I just said that knowing that he doesn't respect Serbs, I wouldn't be surprised that nasty things could be said (out of fury, in spite, etc
) even though they are not literally meant
Was that sufficient to understand why Serbs hate Biden en masse, which was my initial point
Btw this is what Trump said at the time:
You're right
Now that I re-read it, it could sound like it
It wasn't my intention though, sorry
It's good that our whole country was bombed including hospitals, marketplaces, suburbs and even primary schools with inhumane cluster bombs
Yeah Biden should get the Nobel peace prize
Please explain to me me how bombing schools and hospitals in Serbian cities far away from Kosovo helped prevent whatever you're talking about
Could it have been done without massively bombing civilian targets
Netherlands
It's that dimension from Minecraft, am I right
I'm down, every fourth month we should let the animals roam free for it's duration
Good boys
I know of weirdos who unironically think that quarantines should continue after the pandemic because of this
They're violent thugs that are comprised mostly of commies and anarchists with a veeery broad definition of fascist
British isles always have almost no wildlife
Kosovo is Serbia
"flaunt sexuality"
*kissing in public, holding hands*
Wonder how often this happens but isn't reported
Plenty of companies have these bullshit quotas now
Covid like this
It's completely broken
Kinda makes sense
You want the Queen imposing absolute monarchy and ending Brexit
Because this is how you get the Queen imposing absolute monarchy and ending Brexit
that accent sounds so good oh my god
I am proud for you Bulgarians here in Serbia protest lasted few days only
How in the fuck are there so much protests
USA, Bulgaria, Belarus, Hong Kong etc
And when the yellow vests were in France we thought it was chaos
Sort of like the Arab Spring but it's 1st world countries
No you are not
Balkans had it all but unity (sea, islands, mines, mountains, planes, brain and talent)
It could be new Poland but instead, we are the worst :)
Actually, no Balkans is lets say "geographicly inferior" in contrary to the rest of Europe so even if we were the most anti-corruption people in the world, we wouldn't be on equal level of development with the richest countries
I am not saying that we should't try mostly for mental health issues that you can get from our politics but lets be honest will never be as the Netherlands,Germany,Denmark
I've never really realized how flat majority of Europe is
And I've lived almost my whole life here
Mindblown
Meanwhile in Croatia, a Croatian equivalent of Sieg Heil is on a plaque in Jasenovac concentration camp memorial site
Cant see this properly, im color blind
Would be amazing if these charts had % numbers on them
Biden probably got confused about the geography and nobody wanted to tell him
Bush didn't know in the first place
Eh, I admit it was pretty lazy

Meanwhile here we have 3 times the price and half of that internet speed
I don't care who was in the right or in the wrong in that war
I don't care if they are our enemy
Nobody deserves this
War is awful
Well thats sucks
I guess she knows how stupid this war was
Why did they need Kosovo
They didn't, very simple
Some times I feel bad for the UCK soldiers, they went and died in Thousands, all for nothing
They didn't get anywhere
Sure they got Kosovo, but thats more because US & NATO Politics
Prijatno
That's the spirit
People in the Balkans wishing for another war have obviously never fought in one (nor did I)
This happened on both sides, it really is awful
I like you ppl from US
Too bad the bad and evil ppl run your goverment, and Im not talking about Tramp
CNN is feeding you fake news
You dont know better so you beleve them
You ppl can rise up, you have the power
And we are the ones who got illegally bombed by NATO with many innocent people dying and our economy being destroyed and a former part of our country breaking away
Also the Albanians in Kosovo were killing the Yugoslav police and millitary there which is why the war even started
Don't act like you are innocent and just a victim
I am not saying we were any better, but there were many innocent deaths on both sides and war itself is an awful thing which brings nothing good to humanity
You can hate me if you want to, but unlike you, I don't judge people based on their nationality and what their governments do
I cringe when ppl call them Kosovars
They are Albanians
If you really want to call them a differen name call them Šiprtars
Yea they died for their country
That is respectable and everything but still for nothing
They didn't make any progress
You are refering to us as if we made those decisions
It's like hating Germans "because they let Hitler be in charge".
I'm not gonna argue with you anymore, you can think whatever you want but the truth is that both sides were in the wrong, both sides suffefed many  civilian casulties and both were losers
We are taught in schools to hate each other and think the other side is the agressor, which is not true
Peace
Damn, only if there were less ignorant nationalists like you, the world would be a much better place
Top left, he's driving  SK-105 Kürassier

Hey, ive seen this one
So this means what
We will stay like this for how much
6 m? 1 year
Should they have
I mean they didn't score twice as many goals for nothing

Ahem
PERKELEEEEE
I utterly respect Stalin; he was probably the most important historical figure of 20th Century and the man who transferred USSR from a poor and basically feudal country in 1910s to a nuclear superpower in 1950s.
That's an insane achievement only a few people who ever lived would be capable of !
I was sleeping here in Northern Serbia
I didnt feel anything thankfully
A jos nije ni April dosao
Can you recommend some
I know Idi i smotri, but that's about it
I also know of White Tiger, Stalingrad and the Sevastopol one, but all 3 of those are new and seem pretty meh
Edit: Thanks everyone who replied/replies
Too bad this doesn't exist in Serbia
And noone is held accountable nor has been brought to justice for it
The whole Union should be ashamed of itself
MH flights dont have any good luck
i like the award
I'm glad to hear it
Hope something comes out of it
Ok the Balkans are the best by far
Dude wtf even is a hydralisk
Build hydralisk
I didn't know my country is into Star craft (Serbia)
"Build a hydralisk" no comment on my country
"Stand up to my wife" its impossible my good neighbours
How DO I build a hydralisk
Spain bro calm down

Germans deserve it for complaining about winter tbh
It's just a joke i always watched stuff like pro7 and very often i heard people complain about the weather even if it was winter or summer
To be honest, I totally get that
The ratio of cars to parking spaces is 20 to 1 in my city
If somebody did this everyone would be pissed
This is getting out of control
France needs to stand up now, and be a leading example to western Europe
Stop with "peace and cosmopolitanism" bullshit already, it is selfdestructive
Love others, but don't let them take over and dictate their rules in your country
EUROPE, WAKE UP
Dear god now there is a 3rd
Hope our French brothers are doing okey and give justice to those savages,dont care if some see it as a racist thing or whatever murder and even beheading from what I read is an act of savagery
Legit this news is making us also afraid with our problem with some attacks from immigrants, myself included as I was one too almost
what was the third, besides this one and the teacher beaheding
Indeed, that's the biggest problem
Another problem are the classic western irreligious peeps, that simply don't care about protecting Christianity within France
What needs to be understood is that this time is not about Christianity itself, but rather about having a strong anti-force against Islamic threat
I myself am irreligious as well, but that wouldn't stop me to preserve what my country stood for in the past centuries
I hope the French will find a way to solve this in their adventage, and even though I was disappointed in France on many personal and political matters with my country, this time I fully support France in this fight
No more skyscrapers in europe
They look ugly
Europe should have buildings that are built according to the traditional architecture of every place
Can't you have a strong economy without the skyscrapers
This sounds very superficial
Germany has a very small number of skyscrapers considering the country's size, yet its economy is the best in europe and one of the best in the world

Meanwhile in Serbia after 50 years we still don't have  a metro :(
I thought all Russian metro stations had orthodox imagery
Pretty sure I've seen some stations with angels and stuff

Read the whole comment next time
Considering how much they want to destroy our race, they probably don't
Well, let’s see
If you get a 60 minute timeout, you can countinue without a ticket
If a cop pulls you over it may also take a lot of time to do all the work and write you a ticket
I think it is way better for people just to pull over and wait their time
To be honest its not so bad guys
Sure its kainda wird but its interesting
There's nothing wrong with the way they used commas
It reads a bit stuttery, but it's completely correct
I got an idea since the whole fucking Balkans are protesting
We go to every country and pick all the protesters up
Once we have all of them, we just drive into each country, overthrow the dictator, then go do that to the next one
Lol
I know that would never work
Serb from Belgrade that went to the protests here, you're dead wrong
Half of the whole country supports the protests, having in mind that protests erupted in other cities as well
Lol
Closest it has ever been to that is the first Balkan war, but then it was nearly everyone vs Ottomans
Because of the Virus
We already have one planned to
#RETAKE CONSTANTINOPLE
for what they did to Hagia Sophia, so 11th after that
Ah, ok

That sweet sweet EU money will never be ours after all
If I was Vucic, I'd pay for tourism to Baltic republics and Finland, just so that everyone gets to their mind with who we are supposed to be in union with
Compare how more xenophobic the average person from the Baltics is compared to a Turk and you get your answer
And Vucic completelly removed Russian news services from Serbia yet the relations are still good
The feeling is mutual, I think that our government should bring more exposure of Serbs to the Baltic states, they would be avoiding EU like vampires avoid cross
It was already done with Slovakia, Czech R. and Finland, our government should now target Baltics
You need 5 seconds of reading posts from the Baltic users to realize why

As a Serbian boi, me too
I’m sick of all the stuff happening on Kosovo
I want all of the ethnicities on Kosovo to live in peace and the governments causing harm to go fuck themselves
This is so sad its funny
I remember this from Wingman CSGO
Lol EU sensibilities
I like to trashtalk commies to be honest but not everything is black and white, turns out they did atleast something right in my country
I live in an old "commieblock", and basically next to my block there is a whole block of new buildings being built currently
It may look better but trust me this brutalism style housings are made with so much more quality than those cheap-ass shit that they are building all over my country rn
When my family moved in this apartment we renovated it to modern standards but we literally had 0 problems witch if u ask me is pretty impressive considering this building is almost 70 years old
Commieblocks have their own drawbacks
I 100% agree with all of this, especially the location and the privacy part
This old block is filled with trees surrounding every building almost just like in the picture
The new block literally less than 50 meters away, and boom you can see what everyone does in their balconies without even trying to look up
It would be amazing if all these buildings get their facades and hallways renovated somedays
They may not necessarily be the exactly same construction and materials
Even during communism not everything was made to be the exactly the same quality, you still had cheaper buildings and more expensive ones
For example here there are several buildings that are really really bad, they are literally falling apart
But then again they are very different to rest of the buildings in the neighborhood, they are less than one third of the size, with different facades and roof designs, and hallways so narrow that one apartment's floor math is standing in top of the other apartment's one, since entrance doors are so close to eachother
It honestly all depends and I'm not an expert in the topic
How the fuck pig could be racist
I swear, people these days could be offendend by anything
If you are looking to be offended
I mean, it's not caricature of Asian men, but  could be associated with Hong Kong protest at best if you streach it, as far as I understood
And I'm no Brit, but even if it fully support HK protests, it's just political oppinion and snowflakes could melt and stew in their outrage, but cannot force it on others
Seems like Germans love going to other countries in large groups
Map is wrong, nationality that visited Serba the most in 2019 was Chinese (about 150,000 people)

I am guessing everyone knows each other in this place
Wtf Germans, firstly r/me_irl now Spain
what is that between bosnia and greece
There's an impostor
I am a Serb and I support this message
I mean the Balkans are pretty shit anyway, adding you guys can't really make anything worse than it already is
Welcome aboard, Balkans may be a shithole but they are out shithole
I personally think that the wisest thing to do would be to get all Serbs out of there and give Albania a offer, they take Kosovo, and we take a part of their territory that gives us access to the sea
That would be the wisest thing to do if it was like any other piece of land, however, Kosovo has a big importance to Serbian heritage and history, so the smartest thing would be to give them semi-autonomy, they have their own police force and stuff like that, but are our territory and answer to the president, and if need be (for example they start abusing it) we can move in our police
This would be hard to pull off, but if done right it would be the best solution until we come up with a better solution
We do, theres actually no clouds in the sky as I'm typing this
Why isn't Serbia in any of these
For once, Chechia and Slovakia are the honorary Balkans and not Portugal
Kosovo is Serbia
[hmm]
thank god were not in the eu

To serbia mainland ww1 was worse then ww2
>The fact there hasn’t been a major war since WW2 is done 100% to NATO
Uhhh, NATO started several wars since WW2, are you one of those people that still think US and NATO fight for "freedom and democracy" and not to plunder third world countries
[Source (with updates)]
>Serbian police and protesters, angered by the announced lockdown over the weekend, have clashed outside of the country's parliament building in Belgrade
>Tear gas has been used to disperse the crowd
Fuck this cunt fuck him fuck his lackeys fuck his government and fuck every single fuck that takes him seriously
It's fucked up that none of our media is showing these
Ppl there are just gping to get infected
Its kimdof ironic when you think aboit it
Thanks Neighbour
Aww, thanks bro : 3
Vucic is sending 40 assassins to your house
It was staged
N1 je prenosio na svu sreću
Yes because till yesterday our supreme leader was bragging how corona is no more in Serbia
Ah yes, the biggest problem eastern Europe has ever had is Covid, bruh if we continue like this we gonna become "North Korea the sequel️"
wait what im missing is, how can Vucic run in Srebrenica when it's in Bosnia
Barem nije mogo da njih zaustavi
So it's not a local election
Got me there
Not that i endorse that pussy mouth anywhere
No nut november on the first and on the second
Happy independence day, our basketball archenemies
And it's 1 day after Serbia's dan državnosti (don't know how to translate it, maybe country day
Just lol
That this is what gets attention
It says there's no results found
Second link works
Pale old communists everywhere
And how are they different than those liberals
If left is so good Brexit, Trump and Pen wouldn't be option
System isn't working, current gov created this situation and crisis in EU
Not Trump, not Putin, your liberal government
And Macron is same as current president
Liberals won't change until they realise they won't win
I am liberal but for them is better to loose now and to realize their mistakes and come out stronger than to put every problem under carpet until it becomes too big of a problem
No no they are all for democracy, people deciding etc
but when non liberal candidate wins, OMFG why did you vote, you are fascist and so on
I dont like her but I would vote for because I am sick of current EU, and Macron won't bring almost any change
Because belive it or not, we are still in Europe and EU effects us also
For example, that moron Merkel condemned Vucic (our PM soon to be president) which indirectly said she is fine with Vucic being dictator because he promised her God knows what
(Probably that we will take more refugees) and many other examples
Nope its not her time
Next elections or the one after might be since right now many French people will vote for Macron to avoid Brexit and Trump, but when they see Macron is same shit as current president and that nothing will change then they will reconsider right wing
Yeah, Balkan friends who are studying in Germany and Swiss, are reporting that it became much easier to spot our folk there since they are the ones parked on curbs, not wearing masks and not practicing distancing
They say it's much easier to avoid them now, by not starting conversations unless speaking perfect German/French with others
Yet we are still figuring out why are we in the ex-Yu/Balkans in the mess that we are
Go fucking figure
Mig 21s are sooo fucking cool
You're probably better off getting a grippen
The French tend to be tough to work with when it comes to supplying customers with parts and weapons, on the other hand the Swedish will literally implement any weapon you ask for onto the plane, and the plane seems much better suited for the needs of Croatia
No way
Do you have any links for that
Really
I've driven from Novi Sad to Budapest, and the difference is huge in Hungary's favor

Nice
Well they were the biggest, like everyone knows who Hitler was, or who Putin is
I don't get it
Why
Its decided by the amount of news or something
she is fucking annoying
I'm really interested about that
Could you tell me or point me to some sources
(I can read some Polish
) Dzieki in advance
im not saying her agenda is annoying
im saying she personally and the way she approaches things is annoying
Dont worry Norway, our foreign minister only speaks one language, Serbian, and our minister of Defense has never served a day in the army
In our case it is because all the decisions are made by him
All the generals listen to him and he has some stupid ideas about how military should work
Not to mention all the wars we had
We are still weary when the idiot comes at the forefront and starts saying some unsettling shit
Holy fuck that’s hilarious
Yes but he would have gone thoruht the training
He'd have some semblance about how military works
I think that it should matter for the minister to know how his branch functions
Nah smoking relaxes you
And after you're addicted it both relaxes you and your addiction
Montenegro went from orange to light blue in the meanwhile
No one likes our government here anyway
> Legends say they got married in secret
They married in Netherlands, what is secret about it
The story is that she got married in Luxembourg during official visit
I don't know if that fact could be verified
> Serbia, the land in which the Prime Minister is a lesbian, doesn't even allow civil partnerships
which is in process of being changed this year
Ah yes, same-sex marriage, the only thing that matters when determining if country is civilised or not
And the biggest Neo-Nazi group in Serbia is led by an open Jew
No it does not
She is a puppet to the president and has no spine
They are politically anti-progressives which is ironically a progressive and liberal nihilist philosophy that believes the Westernism is inherently flawed and malignant for world influence and that it ultimately leads onto collapse
Now you finally realize why pro-Russian and Serbian nationalist media is pushing for ultra-autochauvinism and pro-Europeanism, it is intended to create fight or flight response
It is a joke by Vucic and Seselj
Both pretty much come from the school of anti-progressives
Btw
Seselj was openly advocate of gay rights even at the height of 90s. They had a lot of openly gay speakers at their rallies
Both Nazadnjaci and SRS belong to anti-colonialist parties, the difference being that Vucic side belongs to left-wing progressive while Seselj belongs to more right nationalist wing
But in essence there is a lot of similarities
Yeah, an economist applying for a job that has a lot to do with economy, just imagine
Why is he right-wing
Here where i am its around 30C and wind is blowing, so i guess we're lucky
I like it
We have [something similar] to the building in the op
The original house was from the 1920s, it fell into disrepair, there was a fire, and was finally torn down to the ground, and rebuilt as a replica, with the addition of that glass tower sticking out
I think it doesn't look bad, but can't compare to the original
This reminds me of an event that happened during the defense of Belgrade in WW1
When AH started bombing the city, they sent a letter stating that Serbs should surrender and meet them at the railway station, waving the white flag
When general Živković arrived at the station, he simply said "marš u pičku materinu" (go fuck yourself) and continued fighting
Why is no one mentioning whats happening in Montenegro right now
Basically whats happening in America with BLM but religion based
Serbian people protesting are getting pepper sprayed and stuff
I dont really have to much info about it so i wouldnt wanna write anything false
Yea look at the first thing i wrote
Leave it to borderline cult like fans of EU to compare Putin to Hitler
I step in parties with minks and fly links
Shorties hittin me with eyewinks as I buy drinks
Nice pollution you got there
Yea, thats why its pointless
Bruh this is Reddit
Kosovo is not a separate fucking country
Oh, just wait another 20-30 years
They will switch places
another thing that is funny is that like half of those points are like that because of african americans even if they're miniority
15-16 is perfect temperature for me
With a bit of a breeze too
I'm originally from Belgrade, it can get pretty damn hot there over the summer (high 30's and even 40+ at times)

Orwell rejected false equivalences between liberal democracies and the USSR, most notably via his book "Animal Farm" but also in other writings
If he was still alive he would understand the difference between closed-circuit television of a public space and (for example) the kind of surveillance that occurs in China
Lots of good ones [here] but this is my favorite
> In my opinion, nothing has contributed so much to the corruption of the original idea of socialism as the belief that Russia is a socialist country and that every act of its rulers must be excused, if not imitated
And so for the last ten years, I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement
Also, one of his most famous books (Animal Farm) is essentially one extended attack on the Soviet system of government
Welcome to Serbia, oh wait
This is also why the EU is helpful, because when half of Europe has the same or similar worker rights and tax rates, the companies don't have much choice
When your country is shitty and desperate for any outside investment, worker rights are the first to go and people gobble it up because they don't have a choice
This coming from the alliance that outlawed people making fun of it on the internet
Great Serbia>>>Yugoslavia
Time to kill someone
how is yugoslavia supposed to be an insult
Except many Serbians would be very happy with this Yugoslavia thing
We've always had a thing about too big to handle country
>Remove some of Serbia from Yugoslavia, but like, not all of it
as a Serb I can confirm this would piss us off
You forgot the reason for it
Its from Ottoman era when material sych as stone that made these structures permanent was forbidden from being used
Every village also had to build one instead one huge one for lot of surrounding area if they wanted a church
There were many but they're gone for variety of reasons as its wooden
Maybe but we still need to invest in some more content, this is practically in the middle of nowhere
Go brothers
Serbia's protests are getting shut down but I feel it and would love to support you guys
Corruption is making my blood boil at this point
Serbia stands with you
We know what it's like
I think former Belgrade mayor had some shady dealings connected to your government
Ahhhh man I hate playing S&D on this map
EU sucks at PR or what you would call propaganda
For example China buys 1 of ours factories for like around $55mil but people here see that and think positively about it, same for railways
Russia being big part in Military equipment so people see that being tested and think about Russia being big donor
So people are seeing material gains for country instead of Monetary and that's why you have this graph
zero fucks given as 99% of that cash is just stolen by our authoritarian regime - which the EU supports
EU is a buerocratic, inneficient, and hypocritical nightmare
I wish Yugoslavia was back
You are recognising a part of our country and you bombed us
The colonisers (EU) have to give money to their colony (Serbia)
It is not that simple, friendly connection of Serbia with China (and with African countries if that matters) is older than EU, and Serbia does get at least some international support from China
Serbians do have positive feelings about Chinese
That if one takes into acuount that aid is rarely "money you don't have to give back" but loans are often  counted as aid and that even those loans have strings attached
the only difference with China is that China is more transpatent about their expectations
Additionally, event if that is all free money it is not even close to amount Serbia lost and is losing on the actions of EU
Like amount of educated people that left
I guess not bombarding, not implementing sanctions and not demonizing whole nation also might help a bit
EU had 70% support in Serbia in early 2000's. But unlawful recognition of Kosovo and uninventive " carrot and stick " strategy as well as supporting the authoritarian regime for over 10 years is not yielding results
Talking sanity is forbiden here
You are supposed to be arrogant , smart guy , subscribed to /DE and not falling for propaganda
All the while reading shit that RFE prints
Idk really, last i remember theyre a small south kosovo province that wants seperation
Why is it shocking
On one side you have China whith which Serbia does have friendly connection since 70's if not even before that, on the other you have countries that bombarded them, implemented extremely harsh sanctions, and before that killed 20% of people in WW2 and 25% of people in WW1
I am noy talking about who is good or who is bad just that Serbians being scared of EU and Germany is not surprising
There is history that is repeating it self
Add to that "aid" mentioned in the graph is given with strings attached and for exact stuff EU thinks Serbia needs, and it usually ends up in corrupt official's pockets and EU knows this
It is not shocking at all
Damn, the way some of you people see Serbia and then say we are blinded by propaganda lmao
Maybe for you but for me its my home and i will never recognize it not even my kids not even my grand kids and so on
We are heart of Serbia and we will always be
Serbs will never give it away
This is exactly what is happening
And China gives less but not as money, as they know how to work with corrupt officials
And it is not possible EU is not aware of that, so the only question is why is EU corrupting Serbian officials
If only
>they do not recognize their war crimes
Young enough to tell you theyre taught to us as war crimes in schools, at least it was that way in my textbook
Give it a decade or two, it will certainly even out the deniers and the educated
worth every buck spent for the US
Ally
That would mean that there's some equality in your relations with USA, but there's not
Who ever denied that
I guess every geopolitical analyst in the world is fed by Russian and Chinese propaganda
Serbia didn't choose anything, same way as Germany did not
Are you implying that Serbia had a 1% of geopolitical importance for the US like Germany did and does
Hell no
US has interest in maintaining military influence in Kosovo, which as you can presume is complete opposite to Serbia's interests, both national and public
And EU ascension is tied to Kosovo independence too, so we have to play with Russia and China
You are intentionally being obtuse
Serbia in history never had close to a living standard that Germany did
> Good life was forced on Germany
There was no choice for Germany, I dont see how I could be more clear
From 1944 to 1990's, German destiny was in American and Soviet hands, and the outcome was not influenced one bit by German people
> Anyway, you choose to play with Russia and China because Kosovo independence(useless ideological battle)
It's neither ideological nor useless
Is Ukraine's fight for Crimea useless and ideological
I was born and raised in Kosovo, and had to leave everything that we had there ( except what could fit in  a  VW golf 2 ) and leave
> instead of joining the union that you know would improve your life quality and bring a lot of improvements
You do realize that Serbia is atleast 30 years away from fulfilling the requirements from joining the EU
Also we have no bargaining chips with EU either, why would they ever let us join
When I was younger, first there was " Just take down Milosevic and liberalize ", then it was " Just find and extradite Karadzic and Mladic ", then " we just want normalization between Kosovo and Serbia " and now  its " we want recongnition of Kosovo as independent country ". EU went from respecting UN 1244 resolution to " eh whatevs
> That clearly a decision based on cost-benefit analysis that serbian nation did
Yes it is
In history we ve been in far deeper shit and came out on top, we will do it again
> It literally is
You are never getting Kosovo back, that is just how it is
That is accepting the reality and trying to get something more from the situation instead of letting it drag you down
Imagine using a word never when discussing politics lol
You keep mentioning this " getting something " by never explaining it to me
What do we get
If Serbia recongnizes Kosovo tomorrow, what do we get
Do we get in EU
Do we get somehow richer, anything
Nope
We get absolutely nothing
So its best to wait, its been only bit more than 10 years, and they are shooting themselves in the foot more and more
> What kind of bargaining chip did Slovenia have
What kind of bargaining chip did Slovenia need
They got their independence from the West, they never had Russian influence in their country, EU did not require from Slovenia to trade its territory for membership
I dont think you realize how different the positions between former Yugoslavia countries were
> Serbia never normalized the Kosovo-Serbia
Serbia signed Brussels agreement and did everything required of her
We gave Kosovo electricity, withdraw all our institutions, gave them area code
All they had to do was create Community of Serbian opstinas and they did nothing, even put taxes on goods from Serbia and BiH
> But it also did not reform its institutions so it can join EU
And that is the main problem
Which I never disputed ( I said that we are realistically 30 years away from EU ) nor it was a part of our conversation
Yet another reason why we should cross the Kosovo bridge only when we get to it, not now
I think the lady said this in Belarussian: ,,We are independent from tutelage
of Red Moscow
Here masters". Also I suppose she first meant to say мы независимы (which means we are independent in Russian) but then corrected herself and switched to the Belarusian word for independent
How I know/assume all of this
I'm a native speaker of Serbian, speak some Russian and was exposed to some Ukrainian when I was on exchange there
Unfortunately this took place in Serbia during the anti-government demonstrations last summer (you can see the most famous incident [over here] This came as a schock to our society, because we haven't seen that kind of police brutality since demonstrations against Milošević in the '90s.
Ah, that makes sense
Thanks for claryfing
This is my first time hearing Belarusian
From these two sentences I assume Belarusian is lexically closer to Ukrainisn then it is to Russian
Is that really the case, though
Yet still our government has strong support from EU leadership and top officials
Interests beat ideals, unfortunately
and 5 days ago in 1999 nato bombarded Yugoslavia
A few days ago was actually the 22 year anniversary of NATO agression against Yugoslavia
The fact that this is downvoted only proves your point
Serbia, nor Yugoslavia was ever a part of that
Yeah, that's my point
There isn't anything left of Yugoslavia
Yeah ok, believe that shit
After that go tweet about China having contractions camps and North Korea forcing its citizens to eat dogs
usa bombared montenegro and serbia for money
Kosovo has many minerals that were going to make bigger countries a lot of money
They fabricated that serbians did war crimes on albanian people
While serbian people had 13 precent in kosovo and were constantly murdered churches were burned down
Video was fabricated of serbians killing albanians which a finland forensics said they were fake
They gave serbia a ultimatum soo bizare
It said nato would have 200k solders on teritories of serbia and montenegro
They aimed at schools, hospitals, buildings people lived in, any company that was a competitor to any us company, a lot of bridges
They killed a lot of civilians
US said that albanian people on kosovo were terorists year before agression on Serbia and Montenegro
They threw 15 tons of uranium on serbia and montenegro which was a un violation people are still dying from cancer and numbers are going up because of that
You trying to defend what us did to serbia and montenegro is unbelivable
You can just google what they bombared in serbia and montenegro
You can see that it was all targeted and did for money
Edit: If there are any errors in english or gramatical idc i typed this because i couldn't belive people belive that this wasn't an agression
It's just sad how much fucking propaganda is west under,and you don't even realize
And,worst of all, you think the truth is propaganda and there is no way to make you see the actual thruth
I mean I wouldn't be able to believe myself either if I was from USA
That's so fucking depressing
I guess no arguments for this one
You can only downvote I guess
It literally is you fucking idiot
Go to Serbia and try saying that stupid shit
Yeah, ethic clensing was done
By Albanians
I went on Kosovo actually
Idk if you know,but i live in the same country that Kosovo is part of
Not a 1st world country that has heard about Kosovo only out of propaganda fueled news sources
I still hope you people are just saying that Serbs were the bad guys just cus u hate us,but you should know the actual thruth
Just in general,i see how western culture makes fun of every conspiracy theory and opinion that differs from the dictated one
Now,most of the shit is pretty dumb BUT you need to stop believing everything they say
Just knowing that media has the power to make you believe something that is false should make you take everything with a pinch of salt
Yeah,actually Kosovo makes 100% of Kosovo,but it only makes about 10% of the Republic of Serbia
Where r u from
It's amazing how huge Moscow is
When arriving by plane, you can't pinpoint where these building are

So Farage and his band of cool kids basically can either sit there and stfu or not show up
Guess which theyll do
Not a hospital for sure
Someone just took a pic of the spoon and then someone posted it saying it's in a hospital for some internet fame
Also in the original article the picture is different than this one and you can see a PS4 controller in the back + a wifi router
Yeah, not a hospital
In any case, it's a very cool looking spoon
&#x200B;
Ömg
Dont worry, serbia has friendly ~~concentation camp~~ hospitals
It's a Belgrade hotel called Design Hotel Mr
President
Each room has a portrait or a ruler
I doubt the journalist would gotten that room in he hadn't specifically asked for it
[A hotel where you can sleep with Hitler]
Hitler room was 200$, and Tito suite 500$.
Just did, had it sorted by Top so it was somewhere way below
And I checked that twitter page
Definitely fake
A really cool spoon though
Tbh I wouldn't mind having a whole collection of their cutlery
It's a nice piece of history
True, but Japan is mostly doing whatever US wants them to do, so they do have influence but are using it mostly to mirror US interests, so it's not really noticable currently
Austria be like: Am I a joke to you
Why
Ah Ortodox brotherin
Ah the good old no data
Didn't know we got into EU already
The only reason i want to be in the EU is so we get actually included in these maps
Maan have you been anywhere outside of your first world echo chamber

Protests in Belarus
Financed and supported by the West just like the '90s protests in former Yugoslavia were
They want to create another "October 5th",to "liberate" Belarus, and "bring down the dictator", but this is 2020 and Russia on the other hand is a mighty giant now, compared to how it was in 1990's. The world isn't uni-polar anymore
Russians won't let Lukasenko go down that easily
Wait till you see Serbia
It says Serbia could’ve entered 134 before Covid per passportindex website
and the Serbian number is wrong because it took into account the covid travel bans during the pandemic in 2020 which were only temporary
You Poles really love to talk about the Soviets every time Hitler is mentioned
It's not
Communism doesn't discriminate on the basis of your skin color, or nationality
True, Poland was a Soviet satellite, but your country was ruled by your own people, as every republic was (except for the Russian one i suppose, which was ruled by a Georgian bandit who hated them, inflicting a world of suffering post-WW2)
You guys think you had it worst, but you didn't. I know you historically do not like Russia in general, but look at it objectively
There is no way you can compare the two
Stalin, Hitler, you can talk all you want
Hirohito is often left out by you guys who like to compare Stalin to Hitler
[greetings] neighbour
The better the life standard the earlier they leave home
No surprise at all
Well im 17 and looks like i got another 14 years .
I don't live with my mother, she lives with me
If you work for 300/400E, which a lot of people in Serbia do, it's very hard to live alone in an apartment where the rent would be minimum 200E.
Living with parents doesn't cost anything
Us too, brother
Nowadays they use the shitty materials and cheap out on everything
They don't make them like they used to
> What do you mean
Faking stuff like this
You couldn’t give us a break, didn’t you
No coast even in imaginary maps
What do you have against us
Why do people keep using this retarded map
Kosovo isn't a country
Other than that, pretty awesome job
Hah, you're right, both "triangles" are just one counter-clockwise rotation away from going back to the original places
We should become friends real quick
Croats are maybe safe, but it would be foolish not to expect Spanish Inquisition as an orthodox countries
I think that you’ve mixed us up with our Bosnian cousins
It happens all the time, don’t worry, we look alike, but their heads are larger
They, for some strange reason seems to have subpar beer, but not to worry
They have the best water, really pure and tasty
Rye could be grown in abundance and Humulus lupulus grow of it’s own without any special care, so with some knowledge, you’ll be good to go in a season
Well, first they would have to deal with Montenegro issue
Nobody wants to be spammed with “Montenegro is Belorussia” anymore
Can’t they just accept it already that Montenegro went their own way
Ouch, are things that bad in there
Someone different finally got elected in Banja Luka, I haven't heard of his policies and stance though
(Also, what does anti UN mean
Is it because they wanna be in Serbia or
So, Dodik the second
Ahhh, the western Balkans
(what about the sarajevo guy/gal
what are they about
If being born in a developed country is something you feel you should brag about, you must be a pretty miserable person
What are you going to say next
That Albanians are native to Kosovo
LOL
Because this is the spot where the airport shuttle drops you off, it is also the first view of Edinbruh I witnessed

It is good to remember not only the muslim Bosnians who lost their lives, but also to know that there where many ethnic Serbian families that wanted nothing to do with the war that where killed anyways in the crossfire and retaliation
We need to move on from this
This cannot be forgotten ever, but this game of who did what to who, and when, needs to stop
That is the only way we can all heal
Im a Serb, and am friends with Bosnians and Croats, and love them all
We simply don't let past generations fucked-upness shape our future or our relationships
We are the same peoples divided by religions, and that's it, that is where the differences being and end
It is time we start moving, collectively, in a positive direction
Rant over
It's like a google search away
Wikipedia is fine
First thing fuck off, saying things like " Serbs support Mladic" is so not true and clear that you have never been here
Only people that maybe still see Mladic as a hero are very old uneducated people in rural Serbia
Far low % of Serbs to generalize on whole population
Second, like in every fucking war, stuff happens that 99% of country doesnt even know
People in Belgrade and rest of towns didnt play part and did not support it, hell high % didnt even know
Third every story has two sides and truth is somewhere in the middle
If I was a betting man, I would say it's safe to assume you have no idea what you're talking about outside of whatever bubble you live in
That being said, if you yourself are interested in moving a positive direction, your first comment to me should be so aggressive
If you look nation by their gov, then Americans, French and British people are sick people since their gov killed so many innocent people
I dont know single person that thinka what Mladic did was ok
And I know a lot of people
With 100% certanty I can tell you that we are ashamed, but like in every country you have uneducated or just sick people
Even Germany has prople that think Hitler was good
Thats why I never defended it, but why dont you talk about hard death statiatics about muslim raids from city defended by UN on serbian vilages around it that lasted for 3 years
lol so your response to me, which is doing that exactly what you are asking for is it to greet it with more hostility
Bruh, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all
Not a minority, just have the ability to handle the white knight-ness of this sub and then attempt to convey our collective and un-provoked opinions
I do acknowledge I am only speaking for myself, I also do believe I'm incredibly lucky being raised by parents who taught me to proud of what I am, and accept others around me
Why is Kosovo googling itself
Honestly kinda surprised for Kosovo there
Why lol
Thanks
I'm a pretty right-leaning person and honestly I disagree with most of what you said, but it's always interesting to see someone else's point of view
Have a good day
I don't like this, people these days are so easy in labeling people, a nazi there a libtard here, yeah sure a nazi these days is going to claim that he isn't a nazi but if you call everyone with whom you disagree a nazi than you are probably the nazi
If someone these days presents himself as antifaschist he is probably closer to antiantifaschist
fucking antifa are as bad as nazis themselves
> Anti-Antifa is usually used to describe activities the most extremist far-right groups in Germany are engaged in
For example the NSU or Blood and Honour type networks are/were involved there
Honestly, I never heard for this, and I genuinely didn't imagine an existence of neo-nazi groups that go out and kill people who bring information about them in Europe
In Serbia people who call themselves nazi or racist are mostly some hooligan firms who follow that skinhead culture there are not many of them and I don't see that there can be a lot of secrets about or secret plans around them they mostly seem as some hooligans who want to act most aggressively against mainstream, on other side I heard that Arayan brotherhood in the US does drug trade so I guess that there are some secrets there to be protected
But back to antiantifaschist in the Balkans there are a lot of nationalist who describe right wing politicians of other ethnic group or other country as fascist or nationalist why present themselves as antifaschist or antinationalist even though using the same rhetoric as them .
I said, calling everyone that disagrees with you a nazi makes you a nazi
Because nazis use labeling as a tool as well to disqualify people and their opinions and so do they he is a nazi his opinion doesn't count
Now of course if someone has an opinion about mass murdering certain ethnic groups or seeing some people as less human than yes he is a nazi
But the point is these terms 'nazi' and 'marxist' shouldn't be used so easily
Wow, an existence of entire underground group that aims to kill political opponents or foreigners this is something that I didn't expect for Germany
Kosovo is Serbia
Knowing what Hungarians think about all this LGBT things, I think this wont be good
Equilizing gay flag with state flag is disqusting !!!
For state flag people are died in wars
So dying for freedom is equal as lgbt rights
You have no idea what you talking about
nor the lgbt defenders
If i am homophobe just because i claim that state flag and lgbt flag can't and shouldn't be the same thing, then ok
But your opinion is irelevant anyway
Lies, this is the metro map of the SPQR
I hoped something like this would happen over here in Serbia when we had our protests
When things like this starts happening, that's when tiranny starts to fall
Yes , i bet they think that every european nation is as developed or more than Norway
Oh fuck off Slovenia and Romania, we should be best in the region
Lol
Yesterday Serbia, today Lithuania, tomorrow
Happy cake day
the deaths went down in the us, showing that it is not as deadly as we’ve heard
Maybe change it to "Golden Horde goes brrr"? Or maybe "Horse archers go pewpew"?
Where is it

You failed me squating slavs

>Expulsion is the method which, so far as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting
There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble ... a clean sweep will be made
I am not alarmed by the prospect of the disentanglement of populations, nor even by these large transferences, which are more possible in modern conditions than they ever were before
Churchill about expulsion of million of Germans after WW2
Unlike Albanians, those Germans (and over 100 thousands of Serbs from Kosovo) never came back home
Churchill is still celebrated as a hero in the west
Not defending all actions of Serbia in the 90s, just pointing out the double standard
Nah, of some ustasa giving water to a Serb
Looks like a southern European to me
Some are darker than others
Albanians are right on the southern  Mediterranean coast
No no cmon now, we’re not Ustashe here
It's an AP photo
I don't want my country to be a part of this union and it's most likely that the EU will collapse in the near future
After the Chinese, of course
After each great ruler, you get one stubborn warmongering, keep that in mind :)
But
Montenegro doesn't have a highway
There isn't a single road with a limit of 130km/h
You could say the same about Montenegro
Ah yes, Hungary, the Magyar outliers
Ofc Poland had to be the outlier in the Slavs with their fmzceking es, ms, and zs
Is it
Last year i was in Sunny Beach me and my visited Nesebar, one younger waitress didn't knew what pivo/piva was, we forgot you guys call beer bira
Also it surprised me a bit, considering how much Russians we saw there and they call it pivo as well
Edit: two years ago, fuck i forgot it is 2021
They betrayed us
&#x200B;
Although that's not something unexpected /s
How is Northern Ireland in the British islands ?
Lol no, thats Rivendell
Lmao pretty fucking useless if citizens can't use it
Nice
I don't support us joining, but it would be fun to see just how much we'd fuck with the system
But but, he already ate Crimea
Huh, I am kinda surprised with us
Most villages are dying and people living in flats and what not
I like how this map solved all Balkan problems
I would very much like to live here, thanks
Ask America to sell you weapons
If they don’t want to ask Russia
Cmon, this is basic stuff people, it’s not that hard to start a war
They expanded to the North
Wow the Dutch are really good at this
Don't forget Adolf

Crackpot
Feels like Amnesia
We should repeat it for old times sake
Fuck Milošević, if only we did it sooner
We have it now much worse hahah
Fuck my life
It is
Other than that, it's cool
Unless you work for 300€ a month, then it's not
Edit: But hey, come visit us
You're always welcome
Honestly not that bad, if you create a nice bubble and don't let any politics in
That means deleting facebook, throwing out tv, not visiting any news sites and generally hanging out with people that don't talk about politics
Though it does get very polluted during winter which is something you cant ignore
Vučić is a modern day dictator, the only difference is that he is EUs puppy, so neither EU nor NATO care much because he is a loyal hoe
Why are you studying Serbian
Tito made civil war inevitable
Negative
Studying aviation
Oof, a tough question really
In this state, not a chance
Democracy is on a pretty low level
I wouldn't call it a dictatorship yet, but it's becoming one
Mentality-wise, more and more people every year support the EU, but it's still around 60-70%. However, if a condition to join the EU was to give up Kosovo without getting anything back, the support would drop to less than 5%. The whole situation, as it is the case with the Balkans, is quite complicated
So if our system changes, and we gain something from the Kosovo deal, I see Serbia in the EU in 20 years
It's a common joke here that when Serbia finally joins, the EU will dissolve
Yet his warm relations with EU/NATO preclude Serbian people from giving him a proper support, because he looks like a spineless puppy, as he is
Interesantno
Do you find the language difficult
Имаш ли проблем са ћирилицом?
Fuck that Yugoslavia
1) I honestly don't know, sorry
2) No one is going to bother you, unless you own a fancy cafe/splav (night clubs and restaurants on the river) in Belgrade
So no worries about that
3) Officially it's illegal, but it has the "blind eye" status
It's not illegal as in the middle-eastern countries, and it's not liberal as in Amsterdam
Basically like every other eastern European country
Although my best friend did go to court because he got caught with two grams
Honestly I wouldn't meddle with that kind of shit, but it's your choice
4) I've seen too many maps with Serbia having, what, a gun for every third person, which is idiotic
Gun laws here are notoriously strict; in order to buy a gun you have to pass numerous exams, fill all kinds of paperwork, the whole process lasts for about a year
Once you do get the gun, you have to pay ridiculous taxes just for owning it, which most people cannot afford
Most of the guns people own are from Yugoslav times, and it probably just sits on some attic
My grandpa owned a pretty valuable revolver, he sold it and bough a new car out of the money
Regarding violence
The dangerous times were during the 90s, so it's over now
I've seen most of Europe, and honestly Serbia is one of, if not the safest country I've ever experienced
In most of Europe, people don't go out after 10pm, here it's the complete opposite
And sure, there are some "dangerous" parts - I live in one of them, but that danger applies basically only to football hooligans and drug dealers
Normal people don't interfere with that kind of stuff
Hope I helped, see you in beautiful Serbia
Yup, no wonder there were a couple of protests unfortunately
Hopefully more to come when covid stuff ends
Just like people in Crimea, m8
Well done neighbours
Greetings from Serbia
Pikachu surprised face
Looks like a painting
It's beautiful :o
Patrolling the Croatian boarder almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
Disturbing lack of trees near the buildings
Weren't so defensive when they were bombing Belgrade
Terrorist*
Serbs also luve u
Yes, did my 15 year old uncle deserve them too
Or any of 2000 civilians that died in the bombing or from radiation
Umm
do you even know why Belgrade was bombed¿
Ah yes, the liberators of the working class brought a tank
Not only that, but they were also liberating the upper class of their property and/or lives
Truly beautiful people those communists
How are the Baltic states Central Europe
Yeah sorry but no way are the Baltic countries central European
Also Croatia is Southeast Europe
Fuck this pretentious German bullshit
Europe's eastern border is the Ural mountains and always has been
This map basically also says fuck Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia
Ah, of course
Because geography itself was inspired and incentivized by the glory and splendor of the magnificent USA
Explain, please
Yeah, let's believe the China numbers
Looks really nice
I was hoping to visit it this year, but oh well, 2021 might be better
Ataturk’s rolling in his grave so fast by now they can generate electricity
Doesn't Russia have their own version of reddit though
Lol serbia god 2 places on that list
Kosovo isnt a separate country
My condolences for Greece and France
Also, let’s not forget that as we wright this down, two countries wage war against Armenians in Caucuses, which is not so different than this one
Well now shit really hit the fan
The same people encouraging on persecution of Armenian civilians in Artsakh and elsewhere within their reach are those who called upon retribution on French people
Actually both
Erdogan is playing very aggressively on multiple fronts
Altho CE cartoons led some crazed lunatics to commit terror attacks, now they have supporter and encourager in a leader of one of the biggest and greatest muslim country
He’s doing it in selfish interest, to stay in power longer, by creating conflict and homogenizing Turkic national being
Because the economy is failing, he only can offer nationalistic and religious pride, by killing Kurds and Armenians, bullying Greece and Cyprus and playing tough with France
First, I’m not talking about Turks as killers, but about Erdogan’s regime
He launched military campaign in Syria where Turkish army mercilessly killed a bunch of Kurds and wouldn’t stop it until  Russia stepped in
In Artsakh, Azerbaijan launched undiscriminated military campaign against Armenian populous with open help of Turkey, I would say even alongside Turkey
In Europe and in Turkey, we are witnesses of increasing number of attack on Armenians
They might hate him, but he is giving them justification and encouragement with its statements, so it doesn’t really matter if they like him or not
Why would you think that anything that someone from the US establishment says holds any real value
They are responsible for millions of lives lost in the last two decades alone
They would say anything that is in their interest
We can see with our own eyes how the conflict in Armenia is unraveling and we could all red about Turkeys army in Syria, no need for you to interpret it for me
It's funny how all of the commenters are Bosnian
Owl mocked the Tit ,  Smh
Savage
I can understand people wanting to have at least 3 children due to graying of Europe but cmon 7 is too much
You should draw Kosovo separate from Serbia, that'll be enough to trigger Serbians
Also write ["Kosovo is Serbia"] for Kosovo
Tesla is Croat
Come home, my mountain Serb brother
Lindt is beautiful
I don't think any other chocolate brand comes close
I remember watching a documentary on rape in South Africa and I think the statistic was that roughly 50% of women are raped in their lifetime
croatian people didn't commit any war crimes in srpska krajina, srbe na vrbe
Yeah, it’s obviously a lie
The first Yugoslavia wasn't forced upon anyone
Slovenes, Croats and Serbs joined willingly and it was quite a pooular move back then
The communist  Yugoslavia was on the other hand forced on everyone including the Serbs
You had option to stay under Italians or Austrians, but I remember you begging Serbian army ( army that you all fought against and some did unspeakable war crimes during ww1) to come and " liberate" you from pesky Italians
Well I agree with you on that, but by the same principal the Serbs should have had the right to secede from Bosnia and Croatia
Frankly the borders of the republic were a superimposed communist creation, by what token were they used as legitimate
Where did you got that from
It's just time to put that stupid talks to rest that someone forced you to join Yugoslavia, or that there was an option for independent Croatia and Slovenia
There wasn't lol
How did it happen then
I'd like to hear Croatian story, especially since your president recently said that you were biggest anti fascists during WW2
Yeah, you know, except that you probably killed close to 1milion Serbs, Roma and Jews, had close to dozen concentration camps and were the only one to have ones for children
Didn't Serbian cavalry march in Split and Zagreb
What for was State of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes formed for
Yeah I get you
Don't even get me started on Milosevic, him and Tito were the worst rulers of Serbia in history imo and that's including the Ottoman sultans
I'm just saying in the beginning the Serbs who began separatist movements did have good justification for it, but the execution was horrible
They didn't even had to be peaceful, just not so hatful and violent to the non Serb civilians in the area
It is very high bar to be doing better than country who lost 25% population in ww1, close to 18% in WW2, country that was under international sanctions for years before getting bombed by NATO, had part of its territory occupied by it, and its unable to progress towards its EU path cause of Kosovo issue
Literally everybody should be doing better than us lol
It's clear that you have no clue what you are talking about, but I will bite
What genocidal lies
Mladić and Karadžić ( and many others) were arrested and are currently doing their time in Hague
ICJ ruled that Serbia didn't play a part in Srebrenica
No genocide happened, nor it was intended ed in Kosovo, also ruled by international courts
Its far more than US ever did in case of, for example, My Lai massacre, which should be ruled as genocide if Srebrenica was one
One guy served 3 and half years in house arrest
And you wanna talk about alternative history
It should be easy to present counter arguments against my claim then, mate
These things  are two clicks away from you
But I bet you couldn't point Serbia on map, so I knew you werent looking for constructive discussion
Have a good day, mate
Lets hear you then
Cmon, you have this " genocidal denier " Serb on silver plate in that case
Why are you running away from discussion then
Your 3 month stay in ex Yu countries clearly makes you more of an expert in international law than judges of ICC and ICTJ
What narrative, mate
Are you implying that what happened in Vukovar was genocide
Do you know even what constitutes a genocide
Why are you bringing Srebrenica up now
Did I deny genocide in Srebrenica
You were talking about Vukovar
You can't stop moving goal posts and avoiding discussion
What I m denying
I m literally supporting verdicts of international courts
You literally didnt defend a single stance of yours
Kosovo is Serbia
LOL koji kralj taj lik hahah
He went too deep
Freude
Yet
Is that Ed Miliband
There are aoooo many better photos of him
Case and point:
And the Queen consort was the Hungarian countess **Géraldine Margit Virginia Olga Mária Apponyi de Nagy-Appony** (6 August 1915, Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary – 22 October 2002, Tirana, Republic of Albania)
She was the mother of Leka Zogu I, Crown Prince of Albania (1939-2011)
This guy is clearly a mad lad, what a legend
Learning something new every day from these comments
Nice
Support Austrian people from Serbia, stay safe
Stay safe brüder, I have family in the area, this hurts my soul
I am really, really not sure if they are trying to put so much hatred onto themselves to get obliterated by a white, christian man, once again
I mean, to be clear: I'm not for retaliation in any shape or form, especially not to collective labeling of a group of any kind (national, religious etc
) but tell that to those folks that live near the immigration camps (or gathering sites of illegal immigrants), places where terrorists attack occur and similar
You really are doing your religious brethren a grave disservice by pissing off the historically  most violent bunch of people (not only Germans, but ex-colonial powers in general) that decided to live in peace, and give multiculturalism a chance
Do not
Wake . Them
But hell, it will happen
No way around it in couple of decades or even years (these things usually happen overnight)
Unless islamists infiltrate each and every pore of western societies
Or those societies make some kind of
Dunno
Religious radical auto-detect systems for which they
omfg
will have to invade everybody's privacy even more due to "on-time detection". Fuck
dude, Synagogue is a Jewish place of worship, not Muslim
What's there to retaliate against
Oh right, it happens
He frogoten his hat lol
We need to see the ISS next
This won't happen in Serbia anytime soon
I wish countries did something like this with Serbia and our dictator
There's a ton of proof of people being forced to vote for his party, even videos
One of the opposition leaders even got our courts to rule in his favor and concluded over 2700 (25%) voting places had major irregularities
What happens with that now
Absolutely nothing, because Serbia is a dictatorship right now
If the president says nothing happens, then that's exactly how it will be
Video proof of a nice lady from the ruling party helping people with poor eyesight:
Article about the court ruling in the oppositions favor, it's in Serbian but I guess Google translate will be enough to validate my claims:
Now after seeing this and realizing even with so much proof, nothing will happen, do you still think we don't have a dictator
This was just the stuff from the major elections
Don't even get me started on the immunity his people have (a son of his main propaganda guy literally killed a girl with his car and ran away and got a couple months of HOUSE ARREST), the corruption, fixed public tenders, the policies, the way he spends public money, the constant blatant lies, the non existent freedom of press (currently our only free tv network is N1, an affiliate of CNN they can't control)
It's becoming unbearable, you can expect to see more protests in Belgrade in near future hopefully
dIvErSity Is OuR sTrEnGtH
\> West abandons religion
\> brings in foreign masses out of a secular pluralist mandate
\> does nothing to integrate them because human rights lol
\> the religious immigrants assert their actual tangible moral authority
\> "Noooooo religion did this
And you people will keep missing the point until you're gone and forgotten
Inshallah I suppose
In the Balkans we don’t really say “Sranje” we say “Pička jebeti matenje” or something along those lines
Jebem li ti mamicu u pičku krvavu
What does it mean,in Serbia we use ,,sikter" it's like fuck off, it's of Turkish origin definitely
[For those who need proof of Serbian black people]
I would add my birth town Brus,  translated to Bra
saturday -> subota
little saturday -> subotica
little little saturday -> mala subotica
Mala Subotica
Urlati has same meaning in serbian
So he is the CHP candidate, if there is a second round with whom will the voters of other parties nationalist, kurdish allign with him or with Erdogan
they need to activate windows
Finally a map of Europe I actually wanted to see
I see that in the end the money did it's things
I bet many "donations" were deposited to those who voted yes
No, I wouldn’t say so
We have the highest amount of register gun per capita in Europe, with 39,1 guns per 100 people, while the US have 120
I would say we have even higher number of unregister weapons, since there is a tradition to keep your armament from wars, since every few decades someone decides its a good idea to wage a war or invade us
It’s cultural thing, really
Yet, we are at lover half of murder scale even tho you all consider us murderous bloodthirsty maniacs
So, it’s not about guns
Same thing is here for legally owned guns
You have to jump trough so much hoops to get the weapons legally
There is also background check and neighborhood query to get one
For carrying, it is even more complicated, and there is just a little window to use it in our judicial system
It has to be in defense of similar threat against your life, but basically, you’re going to prison if you kill somebody in self defense if the attacker didn’t shoot at you
On the other hand, having any kind of weapon is a cultural thing to never wait the invading army unarmed
I’ve heard of people having anti aircraft guns hidden somewhere on their property, just in case
Montenegro uses euros
That is the small rectangular shape next to serbia that is touching the sea
Fixed it
And i am not sure about croatia it uses something called "kuna" so it shouldnt be blue
Kill it with fire !!! i mean covid19
Poor Spain :(
What's up with Serbia
So many countryballs that are not countries whats up with that
Include Republic of Srpska ans Bavaria as you included kosovo
So we are basically mordor
Sounds about right
t. balkanite
but look at the mountains, perfect mordor square
Awesome picture
52% of those interested voted to leave, I don't see the fault of democracy here
Thank god we aren't in EU yet
Balkan holding it down
develop my infrastructure daddy
>Stalin actually had a mental breakdown for a few months after the invasion, he did not issue any orders which led to chaos at the front and only sped up the German advance
This is poorly corroborated and very likely a fabrication
University of Dark Arts
Serbian passport is pretty good, imo, considering everything
EU, Russia, China in one go, I'd say that's a rare combo + all other countries ofc
Od moda srbije do moda evrope
napredak
Is it Putin's or is it a palace of President of Russia
There's a difference​, you know, it's same as calling White house, Trump's.
Same thing was done in Serbia  how they are trying to sell the holy Kosovo for money and a place in the even more corrupt “EU”
We need to be together at these times and unite for a better future
There are so many criminals to clean out of the Balkans
Support to our neighbors from Serbia
Is this the place where Kirikou ran irl
The Balkans part I can understand bc most of us migrate to the region's there like Vienna or Gratz but can some explain the hillbilly part lol
I know a lad who is near the far western part of Austria and he doesn't act like one (aside from drinking beer like a maniac)
Looks really nice but I’m surprised this got more upvotes than your [post] about Golubac which, in my opinion, is superior to Maglič
Quite nice
I'm from village with barely any population and i only had 8  classmates in primary school thats how bad it is
In Serbian it's "mošnica"
Checking in
Favourite heroes by a long shot <3
Kosovo is black because its not a country
are u in my psych class
That's no moon
We are nice and polite
You might think otherwise since we had a lot of wars and things, but I feel like that's the only reason why we have such high number of guns, I feel like extremely safe walking around and the last thing on my mind is that someone is going to shoot me
but is less per capita than France
Feels bad about us colorblind persons

Reminds me a lot of my dads vineyard in eastern Serbia which has a field of apple trees beside it
It looks exactly like this at this time of the year
Oh, and the plum trees too

:O Gde na istoku
Jedno selo kod Petrovca na Mlavi :D
Nice
BTW there's a little line in Serbia, I'm not sure if that's supposed to be there
You should fix it
can you tell me what is that between Serbia, Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro
You cut 1/4 of Serbia
Hope you will fix that while painting
You should really visit official UN website with list of countris and their borders
lol is this Putin too

Seems like you accidentally also drew kosovo
Well, the Serbian Eagle looks

Kosovo is not a country
You made mistake in this map
Kosovo is Serbia
I wish they had a holiday like that in Serbia
Some fords are very nice - for example Focus RS and mustang gt (if you are middle-aged guy with a small penis)
Well, I didn't know that
It is too good to be murican :D
Jokes aside, I had no idea that Ford has European division
Kosovo is Serbia
Help
Sorry, but how the fuck is Moscow on par with Morocco
Romania has 2 friends
First one are the Serbs and second one is the Black Sea
Happy birthday Romania
Happy birthday,  neighbour
Romania is Epic
This suits more for Americans
You're wrong mate Aleksandar Vučić himself had a meeting with the tectonic plates
ROMANIA HUNGRYYYYY

What do dragons eat anyway
I am surprised how high Serbia actually is to be honest
[UK about Serbia]
I doubt is only neutral towards Serbia
More like hostile
Why do they hate Vatican lol
Majority of heroine in Europe comes from Albanian extremists in Kosovo, it's unfortunate that people will hate the whole nation beocuse of things like that but that's just how it is
Oh thank you, I didn’t know
Ahahah thanks for this
Had a good laugh imagining this
God has left the chat
Good
Down with the EU, bring back the EEC
Thia is way you always show dead body to dog
Atleast that is what people do from my experience, so dog doesn't suffer and grief for so long
Oh, that is really heartbreaking
Austria just there chillin lol
Croats be like: Serbian, Bosnian, Montenegrin
In Serbia it is nessesary to learn serbian, english and/or french/german/russian (really depends on school and region where ur school is but learning russian now is rare, nevertheless, you learn 2 foreign languages guaranteed)
How can you ahow 1900's data with 2020 regional borders
The data was measured within the regional borders of 1900
Stupidly incorrect
god bless the European Union
we should federalise it and turn it into a real democracy before those undemocratic ways scare away even more countries
Serbia’s with you
Power to the people
Serbian should always be "sneg/снег" since it uses both scripts
well, karati means to fuck in Serbo-croatian and it comes to Slavic "karati" which meant to scold
From it, we also have "kara" which means dick
It's nice and all, but it doesn't look nearly this good in person
I would go full raming speed here
Good news i am above average, bad news- i live in Serbia
Wow, I though Czechia, Poland and Slovakia would be around 1200 euros
Interesting
As other people have said, we don't. And if we do it's usually somewhere in the neighborhood (speaking for the Balkans)
Another fun fact is that the average income you see here is way higher, so in Serbia it's actually somewhere around 300€. It's similar in other countries next to us, most people earn around a 100€ less than this
Yeah, same in Serbia, it's way less
Most people here earn around 300€... If you have more than 600€ a month you can basically do whatever you want
It really is, everywhere you go, the beaches, mountains, rivers
I always recommend AlmazanKitchen on YT to get a feel of the nature we have here
We have never been a proper democracy
First we were a kingdom before Ottoman occupation, when we freed ourselves we became a kingdom again, then Yugoslav kingdom, then WW2 happened, the leaders would rig elections, have full media control etc, when Yugoslavia fell apart we thought we would have democracy again, nope same things as what happened in Yugoslavia are still happening
Once some dudes transported bodies of 86 Albanians in a truck, some fucked up shit
Truly horrible shit happened in the Balkans during the 90s, no one should've lived through it
Except the KLA, fuck them
Albania was guilty for bombing of Serbia and Montenegro in 1999 (I'm Serbian, not Albanian)
Serbia is one now to
The reason we aren't ranked as one by these western indexes is the west likes Vucic, he wants to join the EU and recognise Kosovo, the west wants this, most of Serbia doesn't
Tacno kako si reku
Problem je da SAD i ostale zapadne zemle se prave ko da vi nista niste radili
My grandfather was killed by the partizans for fighting against the Germans with the Chetniks
He killed 45+ Nazis, blew up one German tank, and before the war had built a whole fucking village with only one of his friends and my father (his son), that didn't matter to the partizans, he was a capatalist who saw through their lies and saw they were treacherous barbarians who didn't give a shit about the country, only about establishing communism
He needed to die
All Balkan countries do
Probably because nationalists are still pissed of about the Ottomans
>I think many people also don't know how cruel the war actually was
I'm not sure which country officially has to take the blame (since it was probably only a few sick individuals behind it all)
Yep
Under 100 people a country were behind all of it
All countries involved should take blame
>A lot of muslim(?) people were put in concentration camps, a lot of lives were destroyed and, since the war only ended in 1995, a lot of people (e.g. in Bosnia and Herzegowina) are still struggling to this day with either trauma from getting raped or having their families slaughtered or having no existential perspective in life or anyone to talk to
They just have to endure their negative thoughts while trying to get by
I understand their pain, I had to go through the same things when most of my family was killed on Kosovo or by NATO bombs
Nobody should have to go through this
> I think many people also don't know how cruel the war actually was
what are you on about
Pretty much every adult in Europe and North America knows about it
With the new technologies, it was literally the most covered war in history until the Syrian war
There are constant news about it to this day
Not really
Right now we are back to peaceful protests, this is good as I don't want the government harming inocents
Hopefully we will manage to take Vucic off
Also I don't think a country with a monarch that has actual power can be a full democracy
>We were a fairly solid democracy, especially by the standards of the times, under the Karađorđević
Yeah but I meant we weren't a proper democracy on today's standards
Back then it was considered good
Jesus that's a lot for a place with only 1k people
We already are controlled by other countries to much, joining the EU will let EU countries control us even more
I will be easier for them to pressure us into recognising Kosovo if we are in the EU
Some people don't want anything to do with NATO countries because of the '99 bombings (these are just idiotic ultra nationalists)
Our almighty, glorious leader Vucic has already struck a deal so whenever refugees go through the country to try to get to the EU we give them documents, so when they go to the EU illegally, the process is to send them back to the last country they got documents in
So we get a shitload of refugees, to many
We want to get rid of this deal, if we join the EU there will be no way to get rid of it
I have recovered now as it was over 20 years ago, but I had to go to lots of therapy in the first few years
BTW it is Herzegovina not Herzegowina
Yeah, that is a good point
Yeah ok, I thought it would be the same for all non-Serbo-Bosno-Croat, whatever the fuck you want to call the language
In the native language it is Hercegovina, but in English Herzegovina so I thought it would be same in Germans etc
Easy one,Croatia
Albania I'd say
Yep
We're really close to illegalizing free speech but those damn protestors keep using it
Bosnia and Hercegovina has free primary and secondary school
Serbia had that right in 1918
Lenin died in 1924
Forming of an empire
When we fought for more autonomy and better rights in the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813), and after a few years had the opportunity to get that autonomy, but Russia, an ally of ours, told us to continue fighting for complete independence with their help, which originally went great but then they fucked us over and after even more years of fighting they offered us the same autonomy we could have gotten before
Of course we declined and continued fighting for independence, Russia pulled out of the war and in the end we had even less rights than before the uprising
(Got actual independence 70 years later)
Bulgaria attacking us without a declaration of war in WW1
When we signed no attack treaty with Hitler allowing his troops to pas through our land only to see some students supported by Britain organise protests against it
Ah yes, the Prussians
How does the average Albanian see the time where he lead the country
Im really curious
Only for it to collapse 25 years later, we were doing better as a Kingdom or Great Principality or even a Despotate
Bulgaria also attacked us in the middle of the night, without declaring war, starting the second Balkan war
We are told in school that the Prusains were catolised and germanized
Very informative answer
Thank you very much
I saw that
It's really good and shows a different perspective then what you'd usually see in the news
Bro it's ok
I never understood people who will hate you because you come from a certain country
None of us chose where we were gonna be born, and we shouldn't hate each other because of what our governments do
We are all just humans and that should be the most important thing
It's hard to say for sure
I have problems when I find some information online, it can be pretty hard to translate technical terms to serbian
Like woodworking, machining or building terms
I'd say this is in part because of my over-exposure to english, but part of it is because my native language internet is almost imaginary
It's probably not good for the ol' noodle
Anyway I feel like I can deal with it, but if have to speak english for more than one day it kind of becomes stressful for me
There is an enormous gap between this internet usage of a language and the real deal
Anyway, I really would like it if there was a way to fit another language through my thick skull, I would love the change in perspective
Generally i don't like it, but my accent earned me a lots of tips during work & travel summer in USA (i worked as a waiter)
People overseas really liked it
Wait, so iPhone is more popular in the US fhan Samsung Galaxy Note, for example
I was forced one time to use iMac Air for few months, and it was a real torture, so limited so closed ecosystem, like made only for surfing the internet and social networks - piece of crap put in shiny box
I always assumed iPhones are the same - overpriced user friendly nacely packaged gadgets for shallow persons who use them as status symbol
Because most android flagship phones like s20 ultra or p40 pro have much better specs than iphones and are much cheaper
I imagine it's because of Android's variety
I was really shocked when I saw how much teens have iPhones in the US (I was an exchange student)
Honestly they cost as much as premium android phones nowadays
Hm, never knew that
I always assumed iPhone is reach kids shiny toy, to be honest
My town because its the poorest town in my country and my country is the poorest in europe
Judging from the name, is it a polluted slum
Which town
Everyone in my country says the opposite
In my country average wage is 410 dollars idk about other countries
Average wage in Moldova is around 440 dollars per month and here 410 dollars per month so no
Average wage in Bosnia is 805 dollars per month and in Albania 452 dollars per month so both have lower wage than Serbia
Gas is about 1
4 dollars per liter so not so good
Oh sorry 410 dollars is on the south of Serbia where i live i switched places of that and average in whole country, in whole country is around 700 dollars [here] is the source but its in Serbian
90% of the things are imported so take any country prices that makes the products (like usa) and make it 40% more expensive
I live in part of city where every elevator is built during communist times

How do u add that blue thing next to your name
Sorry, I'm new to reddit
Nailed it
Thanks
Totally, i speak in somewhat mixed accent (non-rhotic though, because those American r's twist my tongue if i speak fast) which tends to lean more on British or American side depending on the context and current influence
But i use mostly British spelling (theatre, colour
), because of school days,  and words tend to be absolutely random mix of American and British ones (sometimes i say sidewalk and sometimes pavement, apartment or flat, elevator or lift
I'm most often not even aware if some word is British or American
Considering phrases, i tend to pick up both, but i'm aware that some that i use a lot are British  (Mate, fucking hell, 'a'ight mate
', shambolic, bollocks, mental
Thank r/soccer for that currently, as well as my love towards Guy Richie movies and ''Only Fools and Horses'' earlier in my life
Don't really know what you are talking about
In my elementary school I had my English classes right, tho I couldn't wait for breaktimes
I can read well, tho I need my glasses for that, and I can also talk normally with anyone when we are walking on the sidewalk
When I'm home in my flat, which I can get to using my elevator, I often speak English over my native language
So have I got any English mix ups
No, I don't think I do
In all honesty I wish I would use British terms instead of American ones, but their media influence was too high on me
So you're basically Canadian
We are having a bad migrant crisis and it started about 2 weeks ago
You didn’t hear anything because our government doesn’t want you to, it’s pretty complicated, they don’t respect the police clock, or whatever you call it in english, and police isn’t doing anything, they got the masks for covid-19 before us, and masks they get are better quality then what we can get of buy and there is a lot more to say but u really can’t type it all
Here we have a naming convention to add suffixes to any word to make it a name
4 most popular suffixes of the top of my head are: bran(defender) slav(glory) rad(work) mir(peace)
There are some exotic names created this way which are considered rare and old timey
Srbobran (serb-defender) Srbomir (peace serb) Srboslav (glory serb) Milorad (glad to work)
Huh
wasn't Anahita also a Persian goddess
EDIT: Yep
Interesting
I'd say Bendegúz. Also sounds kinda funny
My favorite is still Dragodrag
I met a Srbobran a couple of years ago, definitely still used as a name
Rare AF though
Only ever met him
Not really, one of the more popular names right now
That's the cherry on top
It sounds kind of funny on it's own
Just my personal favorite
It's only my user name
And I know I chose it on purpose
Portuguese sound like Spanish except the person talking is having a stroke
According to the international polls, Serbs are statistically the most hospitable nation in the world
This custom is highly implemented in the legacy and can be traced to the ancient Slavic belief that the host wouldn’t gain any favor of gods if he didn’t show hospitality to a guest
The only Serbian word that is accepted and used across the world is “vampire”.
The Serbian clock-making industry is even older than the world-famous Swiss one
The Serbs had their own clock 600 years before the Swiss did
Ancient Belgrade
Belgrade is one of the oldest cities in Europe, with excavations confirming that the settlements continuously existed here for at least 7000 years
Not far from Belgrade center, at the outskirts of the city, one can find remnants of two of the most prominent cultures in Bronze Age – Vinča and Starčevo cultures
These cities were pioneers in trade throughout Europe and the Middle East, and their potential was in trade with volcanic glass – obsidian
Serbs gave to the world some of the most respecting scientists ever: Nikola Tesla, a wonder-man whose ingenious inventions are still being ahead of time; Mihajlo Pupin, physicist and chemist whose ideas on telecommunications are still breathtaking; Milutin Milankovic, mathematician, astronomer, climatologist, geophysicist, civil engineer whose climatological researches spread all over the solar system and inventor of the most accurate calendar with declination of only 2,75 seconds per astronomical year
We are the world's biggest exporter of raspberries
We use 2 alphabets (Cyrillic and Latin)
18 Roman emperors were born in modern day Serbia, the most in any country after of course Italy
We lost a battle where we had 50k-70k men and the Ottomans had 800 (I can explain in replies if someone's interested)
The only non-American flags that were ever flown on the White house are Serbia's and France's.
We destroyed Bulgaria in a battle /s. Lol
I just had to say that
Actual list
One of the first civilisations was in Serbia (located in lepinski Vir)
We won against 3 armies at once in WW1 (after retreat)
Tesla
We managed to free ourselves from the Ottomans
We won both Balkan wars
TIL luxemburg has its own language
is it similar to german
question: in what language are guvermnet papers
is it in most common language of that place
I am confusion
That is a wrong way to spell Edison
Serbia's flag was flown in 1918 because of WW1, and France's in 1920
[Wikipedia]
I saw a similar story on Twitter a couple of days ago
Basically, they're saying child protection services will take away people's kids if they're aren't vaccinated (which is now mandatory, by the way) and then "sell" them to people from Western Europe (among them to gay couples)
Part of the story is from a 2 year old article and a part is from a person on Twitter claiming social services are currently asking around if children have been vaccinated
I didn't expect that fake news/conspiracy theories in Bulgaria and Serbia are so similar, although it makes sense
We have child protection services
I knew about the social services, that basically do nothing and leech money, but department for children is a new one for me
I know one very popular around the south is that schools are forcing meditation on children so they would turn them homosexual and non-Christian, meanwhile HAARP is being used to disrupt the weather and cause floods so we would starve or get cancer by eating GMO foods and eventually die off from either non-reproduction, due to homosexuality, or starvation
Everything conducted by Brits and Americans
I also heard that chemtrails spray homosexuality on all of us as well
But child protection services
Baffling
Okay, they're probalby not called child protection services, they're called social services
Italia is missing to me, feeling sad because at the moment travelling is not good idea
I greet you very much from Novi Sad, and dream of Italian coffee and Renaissance buildings
Also, this is hard

'At one point someone is going to say that they have to take their parrot out for a walk
' Aleksandar Vučić while talking about curfew hours during the 'Rona pandemic
Link below:
He is not a politician but a doctor and he was speaking on national television about the virus and said that its the funniest virus ever and that we can go to Milano to buy clothing on sale, and then like in 5 days we were in lockdown
Former president Tomislav Nikolic, being an irredeemable boomer when it comes to technology, the internet and such, once famously said *"I'd comment on social media too, but I don't know their phone number"* because he thought he needed to physically, like, I guess dial, say Facebook or Twitter up and ask someone in some call center to leave a comment
Great times

Well it will as soon as we finish our 3 major high-speed lines:
1: Hungarian border - Belgrade
Part from Novi Sad to Belgrade is almost done, from Subotica to Novi Sad it's still just a plan
2: Belgrade - Nis
3: Nis - Bulgarian border
From there you could connect Sofia, to Kulata / Greek border, and probably to Plovdiv and Turkish border aswell
Just don't let sncf anywhere near this network
Ok, get the tgv, but sncf can't be let in on the project
It's always much more interesting to read about other countries and I pretty much already know what kinds of answers Serbs/Balkan-dwellers give
Very true
Shenanigans
For some reason, I found it hard to believe it's an actual word
Discombobulated
I was like "this is a joke
No way this is a word"
Then later "WHAT
FOR REAL
NO WAAAAY
I couldn't comprehend that Bureau is an english word when i first saw it

Thank you, cind sir
I love Christmas and Christmas stuff and love to see store selling it

Exactly since all Christmas songs sing about snow aswell
There is no really a hatred towards Germans anymore, but they are still remembered as the enemies
Yes, a lot of us still hate your guts
See, of it was just the world wars much less would hate you, but then you backed up the '99 bombings
Nobody here hates you much more than they hate any other NATO country
This is probably a list of the most like and most hated countries
Hated:
Albania
Croatia
Germany
Austria
Liked:
Russia (has saved our ass multiple times)
Greece (only NATO country that didn't bomb us, and we are both orthodox)
Romania (we are literally the only two Balkan countries that don't hate each other)
China (this one is debatable, we hate the Chinese agenda, but recognise they are useful, so this one could go forth most hated as well
Mostly we like then because they are one of the two superpowers that don't recognise Kosovo)
It's zigzaged
As always we are nation of extremes, and everything is black and white
My grandpa always says "When Berlin Wall fell, I knew the dark times are ahead of us
" While my other grandpa kept talking how much of a blast he had working in Germany in the 80s. So who knows
Are they
Where I live everyone's like "Germany is rich, good laws, good people
Yes, true, but it would be unwise to forget that Germany or Germans tried to wipe us out twice in the last century
You could admire the Germans and Germany and be wary of it in the same time
We hate you because of "Gay fart Tony Blair"
If you don't get the reference, our current President (Vucic" wrote a book called "Gay fart Tony Blair" after the '99 bombings
Most of us don't classify it as a country lol
That's why I didn't put it on the list
Wait, Kinder is Italian
My whole life has been a lie
Yeah, Mondelez International
In wealthy countries, it works well
In poor, not so well, but the alternative would have only been worse (for the people)
I'm not sure it's a fair comparison, the economic inequality is vast in the US, but even with it, the US has GDP per capita that is even higher than that of Sweden
As per not wanting to downgrade, the way it works in Serbia (which is by no means a model example, being a poor country) is that all employers are obliged to contribute to public healthcare through taxes, but the good employers on top of that often offer the private health insurance to their employees
Private healthcare here is fancy schmancy - appointments without long waits and sparkly well equipped hospitals, unlike public ones which are understaffed due to the MDs leaving to Germany, long waits, and poor conditions
Here in Serbia in most parts its ok to drink it and we do,but in some parts water isn't drinkable, but i personaly drink tap water
Yes it is very common
We mostly drink from tap water, bottled water is only for when you are in the city and thirsty
NOT
TALK
ABOUT
THE
WARS
A lot of people  here lost people in the Yugo wars, also you will start a shitload of fights
politically: Just stay out of any of it
And if someone present criticizes our own country, don't agree and don't join in
It's our privilege, I criticize my country, not you
socially: Don't create draft, older people will act as if you invited death itself
Don't wear shoes in a house generally, especially not if visiting - even if a host insists you can keep them on
In public transport, never refuse to give your seat to old ladies, pregnant women, women with kid(s), invalids (i mean this is a general thing, i hope
If you're a man going out with woman, never ask to split the bill, it's expected that you pay, not just on a first date
I didn't even know this was a thing
I don't think this is a big taboo for us, except for war veterans obviously, and sometime they give their two cents as well
I'd gladly give my perspective about the wars to anyone genuinely interested
Alexander the Great was North Macedonian
I don't feel like getting banned from another sub today
You guys from Denmark went to school trip in Serbia
What was purpose lol
To show you how country should not be menaged
I only realised on reddit that you don’t have pita sa mesom
You only have burek
We have both
lmao it was only a joke, but this is next level
If by em you mean Albanians, I don't mind them, just hate a few specific ones (which if I talk about people assume I hate all Albanians and am faking and then I get banned)
If you mean Kosovo's independence, 1
It's illegal under every possible law, 2
It's always been part of Serbia 3
Albanians only got majority a very short time ago and only appeared there in the 14th century and until the 1800s Serbs outnumbered them more than 10 to 1
Yea
But we have two different filo dish
Pita, it could be rolled or laminated with filo for pita, and then we have burek, made with filo for burek
UN res 1244, Serbian constitution
This is the first American I have ever seen who has enough common sense to realise this
I read somewhere that Serbia is the least racist country in Europe
How the fuck are you worse than us
Here you literally can not say anything against the government
All our racist energy is directed at Albanians
Lmao i guess
Umm here come the Balkans
Yes
Sometimes gets more than arkward (straight up attacking each other and shit)
I talked to a few Kosovo Albanians but we have a different take on it since we live in Germany
As long as you don't blame or insult anyone it's fine, but I always look to change the subject
It's not awkward tho
>german speaking countries, we are highly aware that we were part of the baddies in WW2
Switzerland
Same with us
if you get rid of the past 30 years
>Aye, everything south of Kolpa river is a mess
It's **Kupa**, you bastard
it sounds like an awful idea honestly
the people who were speeding will continue speeding because the reprecussions are the same and some people who weren't speeding will begin speeding because now they have an extra option
God Bless America
If it counts we bought a fish for our Biology professor to open up instead of having a test
Literally same lmao
Weak
We kiss three times when we meet with new or known people here
Their parents could be bugged, they don't want to take any chances
Srećna Nova godina i Božić onim koji slave :)
There are slim chances EU will survibe this
I do think Orbán has plans for making some cind of "Central European block" with Central European and Balkan countries
But we'll see
How will there possibly be no one else to blame
There will be foreigners, Soros, Brussels, anything but the dictator
That's how this thing works, you don't have people thinking about a problem, you have a process where they will certainly fail to do anything
They will lie about this, then they will find traitors or some other reason - it will never come to accepting responsibility for anything
It would be really nice if I was wrong, but I'm not
Bookmark this post, come back in .. maybe five months
Six
It's almost like I'm psychic
It might survive, yeah, but without some members
Speaking of Orban, it seems he wants to bring Slovenia and Serbia into V4, and form his block inside EU
V4 and Balkan states I think
My guy Europe's border is the Ural Mountains
In no geographical way is Poland in the east
Yeah there's this one artist called Jala Brat, and the other Buba Corelli
And it's not just me, I don't think there is anyone who understands them
(Btw they are not foreigners)
Most american movies where someone is speaking "serbian" : half of the time it's btoken russian, and other half is just random sound (I'm guessing how Americans hear it
And when they get the language right, the tones/pitch accents are completly wrong
In Serbia it's "you'll become a garbage man" or "clean the streets".
That i would dig holes and work in canalisation of some sort of i can correctly translate it
If you don'tstudy you will became a bum just like our neighbour [insert name here]
That we are racists
We are not, we only hate our neighbors (Exapt Romania
Everyone loves Romania
That we are all mafia and that it is very dangerous to live here
> "here girls are not easy like in france"
haha
Jesus so many Romanians in one thread talking about electricity
Well I never heard of Greek language, is that a thing
I mean, tha half of math and physics is just GREEEK letter
Ironic because it's much much safer here than in America for example
Yeah, it would be weird to smoke weed while sleeping
It's like you've been waiting to ask this your whole life
Yea, we can't buy guns in Dis
I have another one, would you like Greenland to be independent
Vaccines are mandatory in Serbia aswell
Of course I think you should get vaccinated but for things that you can just naturally overcome isn't necessary and pretty sure they don't force you on those
Was in Greece two years ago, and there was a pizza restourant with a sign saying "You came pizza you tried no"
Besides Novi Sad which is famous for Exit music festival Belgrade is really popular with "splavovi" (rafts on Danube which have 2 floors and fancy atmosphere [some splav images] and it is in top ratings for partying capitals, [lonely planet gave it no1] For foreigners prices are really cheap compared to what they are used to, we are super invested in partying as it can last up to 5 am and then afterparty is also an option
Also foreigners get lots of attention from our girls, both cause we are not so touristy so they are seen as "exotic" (there are also some infamous gold diggers too, it's not all perfect)
We offer many things as city has traditional taverns or kafana, already mentioned splavovi for rnb and popular global hits, rave/edm scene, rock, indie, you name it
And we love drinking, it's almost a national sport
Feel free to come, we are waiting for you with open arms
Belgrade is not trying to move away from it, Belgrade is embracing it
32°C. Not good, not bad
I already experienced worse previous years at this time
Well to cool myself down I have AC, I free water bottles, I have ice creams, also I just completely make the room dark so there's no sun coming in and it gets cold
Rakija in one hand and a Cevap in the other for us Serbs most definitely
My parents are Bosnian Serbs and they feel 100% Serbian
I'm sorry to inform you that you are written in the book of Serbs, so you are 101% Serb
Doesn't matter, you are one of us
And beware, besides basketball, our national sport is to fight with your family over nothing for years and years
I feel it's kid of similar, but hey my country is goung to shit
And this is something you notice, we are getting more homeless people and nuts people in the street
Guess because our healthcare and social programs are going to shit
>**Article 1: Republic of Serbia**
>Republic of Serbia is a state of Serbian people and all citizens who live in it, based on the rule of law and social justice, principles of civil democracy, human and minority rights and freedoms, and commitment to European principles and values
Article 1
Republic of Serbia is a state of Serbian people and all the citizens that live in it, based on the law and social justice, principles of civil democracy, human minority  rights and freedoms and commitment to European principles and values
Art 1
Republic of Serbia is a state of Serbian people and all citizens who live in it, based on the rule of law and social justice, principles of civil democracy, human and minority rights and freedoms, and commitment to European principles and values
I was in Thessaloniki few years ago speaking to some Ukrainian and American dude while on a school trip
Suddenly this old Greek man approaches us and randomly says something along the lines of 'Macedonia is Greek and death to or destroy the false Macedonia'.
I just nodded and smiled
It was so random and bizzare
To be fair I think there was some anti-Macedonian rally in the city at the time as I saw Macedonian Greek flags everywhere but then again Greeks love their flags
Probably Eastern Serbia (Especially Bor and Zajecar cities)
Bor is basically the same as that Greek city you described, while Zajecar has enormous unemployment rate and most of the people there leave the country to find a workplace
Also, Leskovac in Southern Serbia, which was one of the richest cities before WW2, but was tottaly destroyed during the war and didn't recover since
The remaining Serbs living in Kosovo
Sounds a lot like Vojvodina
Is it similar like in Cod black ops lol
I've been to Shkodra and it didn't look that poor to me
We Serbs are very family-friendly people
Well not quite by the meaning
But literally we have a name for every single member of family
Uncle can either be "Stric" (from father's side) or "Ujak" (from mother's side)
Same for Aunt
BUT Uncle is called these ONLY IF he is a brother of either parents
If an Uncle is married to a sister of either of your parents, then he is called "Teča".
It goes both ways
Your niece is not just your niece
It can be "Sestrić" if it's your sister's son, or "Bratić" if it's your brother's son
Of course "Sestričina" or "Bratičina" if they are their daughters
Our ancestors are very important for us
So important that we won't say grand grand grand grandfather, but instead "Askurđel". Infact we can go up to 16 generations backwards and still have unique names for them
You'd think once you wrap your head around who is who you'd be done, BUT you will eventually get married
Now let me tell you that every member has it's name in relation to either husband or wife
Yes, you've read it correctly, EITHER
For example if you happened to be a handsome groom, then your wife's mother is called "Tašta". But if you are a beautiful bride, then your husband's mother is called "Svekrva". Mother-in-law is just way too lazy imo
Does your husband have a brother who is also married
Well then HIS WIFE is your "Jetrva". We can go on and on about this one but I think this is enough :)
The unique feature of my language, that no other *European* language has, is that we have 2 official writing systems
One of which is fully phonetical
Meaning one letter always has exactly one corresponding sound (which is also one of the unique features)
I know about Spanish but there "c", "g" and "y" have different sounds while "h" is not read at all
I'm talking 100% phonetical without exceptions, not even foreign names
Well other Slavic languages have the next one too, but other European languages don't have this feature
One verb from any language can be translated in at least 2 different ways
This is because the continuity of an action is described within the verb itself and not by the tens
For example:
I crossed the street - Prešao sam ulicu
I was crossing the street - Prelazio sam ulicu
Prešao is a form of the verb "Preći", while Prelazio is a form of the verb "Prelaziti". However both are in the same tense
This is also the reason why we only use one past, one present and one future tense (unlike English that has past simple, past continuous, past perfect
We do however have almost as many tenses but we don't use them anymore
What's also interesting is that you can use any tense to talk about any point in time
You can even use imperative
Especially present tense
You can use present tense to talk literally about any point in time, either past or future
We are able to speak or write words with backward-ordered consonants, like “travel = veltra “ and we are able to understand (younger generations at least) what word was it
Nouns, verbs, adjectives, even personal names
Speaking like that is supposed to be cool
(It’s called “šatrovački”)
(Original - šatrovački - literal - slang)
- Zemun - MunZe - city name
- Miloš - LošMi - personal name
- Brate - Tebra - brother - dude
And famous one: Žili mi ruka - literally means “my arm is showing tendons” but what the person was saying is “suck my cock” (liži mi karu)
We actually have lots of fun with it
So do all Slavic languages
I tried reading it, but there is no way to do it hahaha
What does that word mean
Is it easy for you to pronounce it, or is it also a bit challenging
Romanians sure have a blast when visiting Pula, Croatia
Yes it's actually used in everyday speech
Mostly because there is no other "neutral" word for any of them
We always use those
I know about your "dundo" which is used almost exactly as English "uncle", however we always specify the relation
For example "ujak" always means mother's brother and if you'd use it for your uncle from your father's side, it wouldn't make sense
The only thing that is slightly out of use are the names of greater than the 5th generation
We know exactly what "deda" what "pradeda" what "čukundeda" etc
means
Names like "svekrva", "tašta" and even "jetrva" are also used without confusion or sounding like a 70yo grandpa
We don't learn those at school however as it comes naturally for us
Edit: names of each generation's male: otac, deda, pradeda, čukundeda, navrdeda
From here on it goes as: kurđel, askurđel, kurđup, kurlebalo, sukurdov, surdepač, parđupan, ožmikur, kurajber, sajkatav, beli orao
As you can see from the 6th generation names are almost random, and thus less known for an every day speaker
American English has more differences from British English, than Croatian with Serbian and Bosnian
I understand what you're saying, but decision to proclaim those languages as separate is more political than linguistic
Thanks
In Serbian we say "četvrt", which is exactly the same as your "čtvrt". I find it very interesting
Wintertime
It feels more natural to my bio clock
I’m an early riser, but with this summer time schedule, I feel like the day is passing more quickly and I never have enough time
I need more time to adjust then on winter time
Winter time as it's the "real" time
However, I'd have everything start an hour earlier (fuck it maybe 2h) thus in effect having summer time as well
But people would probably say "that's too much effort" or something, so fuck everyone then
[Blooming of the Tisa river] is a phenomenon occurring only once a year when a rare type of mayflies mate just above the river surface
After emerging from the mud of the bottom of the river, adults only have a few hours to mate before they die with the sunset
Consequently, groups of males will frantically try to mate with a female, creating a sight that reminds of blooming flowers
Females will fly 1–3 km before laying their eggs on the river, which then sink to the bottom
The larvae develop in the mud for as long as three years before hatching
[Video of the occurrence
During war with Bulgaria in 1885 we let Red cross pass through our country to help wounded Bulgarians .
Our hospitality
Literally we have a saying that the host knows where you will be seated before you even arrive to his house, which is usually the best one
Then we would ask ya a billion questions likes of "what you want to drink" "are you hungry
No you are bc yer skin and bones
" and such
Funny enough in the middle ages you were obliged by law to show hospitality and if you dont you would get whipped or in rare cases, chopped off yer arm
It took the Serbian army only 18 days to breach the Thessaloniki front in 1918
French, Greek, Italian and British army – although outnumbering Serbian army – didn’t manage to do it in months
The breach of Thessaloniki front meant a complete disaster of Austro-Hungaria and Bulgaria
French general and supreme commander of the Allied armies on Thessaloniki front was overwhelmed with Serbian courage that he declared if he had had such men in other Allied armies – the war wouldn’t even have broken loose
It has been recorded that the Serbian army liberated their homeland so quickly that the allied armies weren’t able to distribute supplies to them so fast
One year after we became a state of our own, we had a debut on Eurovision with the current name (before: Serbia and Montenegro, after: Serbia) and we won
We and Switzerland are the only countries which managed to do that so far
Why do all Romanian names make me go NUMA NUMA YAY, NUMA NUMA NUMA YAY
Congratulations are in order
It's actually pretty similar here we like to drink coffee and do nothing as well
Really wow I did not know that
Do you have a source
I was hoping someone would mention this
I love how everyone picks their own countries
It is pretty obvious that the city should be in Eastern or Southern Europe
I would go for Sarajevo, because it is a mixture of Slavic and Muslim cultures
A 1990s non-existent city in the Federal Republic of The European Union located somewhere around the Adriatic, due to the formation of a unified European state the cultures are all messed up with 50% of the people being Italians while the rest are a mixture of Tourists, corrupt government officials and various European and non-European migrants which together make up this Free city
It would combine elements of Post soviet eastern European run-down industries and western Mediterranean coast cities, a somewhat unusual mix but I believe in the context of a game about crime it would make sense
Balkans and Niko Belic
One word:
BALKANS
Does it have to be modern or not
London, again
Yeah, Rio would be mad with all those favelas and narco cartels
> Sure it would be a fairly small map compared to GTA V but still pretty fun
then make the starting position the East Berlin
Đavolja Varoš (my opinion quite unpopular)
Weird rock formation, nothing much
It’s not expensive, but it’s hard to get there a bit, and then u see literally nothing
Imagine being able to trust your own goverment lmao couldnt imagine that
How the fuck do you not like gulaš
I don't know man, I love Hungarian cuisine, I still haven't tried anything I didn't like
I also like your craft beer scene
As a Serbian
oh boy
can't even begin to look for the actual movies but usually when there is a "Serbian" in an American film, it is a brute, a terrorist or something like that, speaks Russian or gibberish, and has a name that no one who knows anything about Serbia would deem Serbian
Like I remember from about two decades ago one episode of the Outer Limits had a murderous dictator called something like Mistoslav Krupchek, that spoke Russian with an American accent
EDIT: Also the GTA character Niko Bellic is supposedly Serbian
Niko is not a Serbian name or nickname, and while there is a surname Belić exists, Bellic is super weird because there is no double l in Serbian and double letters in general are not common except a few, maybe (4-5) exceptions
EDIT 2: Please stop telling me Nikola is a name in Serbia
I am Serbian and I am aware of this, but Niko is not a common nickname for Nikola
Also, maybe Niko Bellic is not the best example because his nationality is officially not defined
My mistake, somehow I was under the impression it is cannon he is Serbian
Almost any Hollywood movie that has a serb character in it
A they give us cheap Russian accents and B it's almost always putting us in a bad light
Better question would be, is there a show or movie where Serbia (or the Balkans as a whole) *aren't portrayed* in a deeply cringeworthy manner
My thoughts exactly
We have internet
It is easy
Or take 2 famous athletes and combine it ffs
E.g. Novak Jokić is a legit Serbian name
Met a lot if Nikolas not one of them went by Niko
Yeah, Croatian and Serbian are almost the same
And I do not blame people thinking he was Croatian cause Niko can be a Croatian name lol
Anyway I think Niko Bellic is not less weird for Croatians or Russians either
well yes, but no one uses that as nickname, niko is word for no one
>A proper pronunciation would use a hard 'ch'
100% not true his name has ć (soft letter) ch is Č
maybe in bosnia, serb there are little diffrent then here
But thinking biggest mistery is, why the fuck is his cousin roman
wtf is that name i never heard it (best guese its russian like name varation of Romanov)
ik dont worry i am just saying GTA 4 has one of most shit voice acting ever (and a alot stupid things), it would be better for Niko to be just russian
* Not only serbian is shit in game
* Roman is no where near serbian name
* Serbia is not in estern europe
Sorry for rant i just fucking hate that game (its littery pain to play it with sound)
Oh yeah
And Vojvodina is not good enough for you
How insulting
That's cause nobody jokes about it
Everyone wants something that "belongs" to them, and you just can't give everything to everyone
Wait, Western
>reconquering
When did kosovo have that
Want kosovo serbia back then
>It was never ours
Why did you say reconquer then
>If we wanted to take anything back from Serbia
Tf you mean "take anything back" you never had it, Kosovo didn't change its borders a single time for the duration of it being a country
Lack of healthcare, lack of regulations when it comes to basic things (tap water isnt drinkable in many places), proto-fascism, bad education, drinking age, gun laws, circumcision
Quite a few thinkg I would say
Be 16yo; take a photo of your own dick; send it to a 18yo girl;
Go to prison
WTF
All our cities are kind of fucked
Any small village/town are all really nice, plus that's where rakija is mostly made so that ups how good it is a lot
Well the vibe is *completely* different
I think people who like Berlin might not like Potsdam
~~English name~~  american way of pronaunciaction of Scott is prounaunced as serbian word skot (basterd)
Well no, because Scotland is "Škotska" (shcot-skah) in Serbian, and likewise Scottish people are "škoti"
We say it diffrent, we say it Škotska (Š is sh sound)
>No it isn't.  The name "Scott" would in Serbian be pronounced
>skaat
Its not pronaunced Skaat at all its skot
Umm I am pretty sure no one pronounces Scott as "skat". We pronounce Scott and skot the same
Zapravo i ja i ti smo pogresili ali smo ipak ispravni
Skat je britanski, skot je americki nacin izgovora
>Umm I am pretty sure no one pronounces Scott as "skat
Britanci tkao izgovaraju, mada kod nas se gotovo nikada ne prevodi tako
TIL doduse nikog nisam cuo da izgovara Scott kao Skat
[Wiktionary begs to differ] Sounds remarkably similar to skot, the only difference is that Serbian does not have ɒ sound so we use o instead
I'm still hoping to actually move to Greece and run a small B&B on one of the Ionian islands
I don't need much, just to be close to the sea
Southern France for the beaches and nice weather
Germany or Netherlands
Except the quality of life there, I like how fun it is, always something happening and people are awesome
For instance - Norway, yeah it has a pretty good life standard, but it's kind of uneventful and quiet, except that, I like cities and urbanized places more than mountains, forests and other natural goods
I'd love to live in Greece
i'd live in France, but not in Paris rather some city on western coast,
Definitely the Netherlands
Yeah, but nowhere is perfect
Nema loseg vremena, samo nepropisnog oblacenja
I can't understand how people in online games think others don't speak English
Also what cunts, our language is fine thank you very much
Yeah, "sladak/slatka/slatko" - cute, but literally means sweet
If you're still with that guy, and he ever asks if you have something sweet (to eat), say: "Evo, ja sam slatka". That's a classic comeback for that situation, means "Here, I'm cute
You're very much right, but sometimes it's quicker to refer to something in your native language to the other person you're playing with
I sometimes use them, but that is because a Spanish friend introduced them to me, but otherwise I wouldn't have known about them
I'm from Vojvodina (northern Serbia) and my grandparents from both sides had only those kind of decks
(they called them "madjarice" - Hungarian)
In Serbia we have besides Christmas and all other European holidays a Slava which is like a family patron saint that you celebrate with your family and friends and they are usually in late fall or winter, so by drinking and having fun we endure long and cold winters
November-January is the best time of the year for me
Christmas, New Year, 3 birthdays, skiing
It's cold but still very fun
Same for Serbia
You should
Or come here,a peaceful place and stuff is dirt cheap
In Switzerland you would be the avg guy,in Spain on the richer side and in Serbia you would be set for life with everything you wanted
I'm pretty sure it's a hypothetical question to discuss
Never, all the options in my country are moderate right wing or extreme right wing
I’m quite left wing soooooo
Nearly everyone smokes here
I have one of the rare families where no one smokes though
This may be the worse country in Europe when it comes to smoking
You'd pretty often find people smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a day
People start at the very young age
You can see professors and students smoking together in the back of a high school
You can find a loooot of cigarette butts just laying around
And just pretty much everyone is smoking
About 40% of people smoke here
Nobody gives half a shit if you smoke
Here in Serbia most of the smokers start at high school (14-18yo) which is really bad and it's usually because of the effect of the friends
Thankfully I'm not so easy convinsable person
I see it as disgusting, and hate it, but many others don't really care and non-smokers mostly let smokrr friends smoke in their house which is stupid
I have a feeling it depends a bit on your social circle or generation
I think maybe 10% of my friends smoke tobacco
In my family only my dad smokes now
I've never even tried tobacco
Serbia and Russia aren't in the EU
[This] says ours is 40%. Also we aren't in the EU
Same
We'll eventually reunite Yugoslavia in Germany
Oh you are from Siberia
No, I am from Serbia
I heard it’s really dangerous out there in Syria
That we are like the world's biggest exporter of raspberries or something
We're trying to keep up too
Fun fact Serbia will "surpass" Bulgaria in population soon, because we lose less
Rotterdam is the biggest port in Europe
I read tomatoes instead of tornadoes and was soo confused
Why is that man
Not judging or anything, just wondering
Are you afraid people might treat you differently or something else
It's not because of that, those Serbs were always there, but Tito didn't give a shit about ethnic compositions when he was drawing the borders of Yugoslav republics, which is what we have today
That's very impressive and surprising to hear
Mostly around the border with Bosnia
There were like 500k+ before the war, these are the ones that weren't forced to flee to Serbia and stayed
No those are the ones that weren’t forced to flee
Drzi se
Pozdrav
I just read the longer comment, that's so sad
Do you identify as a Serb on the census though
Čuvaj se ~~brate~~ sestro, i budi ponos~~a~~na svog porekla, makar mora~~o~~la da ga kriješ u javnosti (to važi za sve, ne samo Srbe)
Oh no, no no no no no
Saying something like that is the easiest way to indirectly commit suicide
That's what I said
You said escape thats not the same mate
Ah izvini, editovao sam komentar kako treba
Yeah you're right, the way I said it looked like they had much choice
Edited the comment
but how's that comparable
Russian doesn't have a standard latin script
When I was in Montenegro a couple of years ago, I've seen two of them on entire beach
Definately depends where
Greece might be the highest IMO
Around 1 in 3
Now mind me I don't go around counting the number if pairs I see its just and estimate
In my 10 years of going to sea, I've seen 10 people being topless
The probably range from 7€-40€. Normal wage is around 400€-500€.
Average wage in town i am is 200 Euros so it's more than half of average monthly wage
I lived with three host families, and have many friends who're exchange students
I know of some VERY crazy stories that happened to both me & my friends but I can't say this is something I ever heard of before
Had the exact same thought
I'd definitely Google them but wouldn't bring it up if it wasn't worrying
I can understand that Middle English excerpt better than the Early Modern one, due to the latter's flowery language
>*Knight there was, and that a worthy man,*
>*That from the time that he first began*
>*To ride out, he loved chivalry,*
>*Truth and honour, freedom and courtesy
>***"Fully worthy" (respected, in high esteem)*** *was he among his lord's* ***men***,
>*And* ***there where*** *he had ridden (no man* ***fairer (more beautiful)****)*
>*As well in Cristendom as in* ***"Heathendom"***,
>*And ever honoured for his worthiness
Bolded is what I changed and am not that certain about
I don't understand the Old English at all, maybe I could guess a word or two
Scots is not hard, but it is about something I already know
There are a few words I wouldn't recognise on their own, but context helps (e.g. *hidlinweys, kythed, sauf,* etc
I knew what *bairn* was beforehand and *tryst* as well, but I didn't know it meant marriage in Scots
First 3 easy
4th is hard and Scottish is easy
Early modern English and middle English without much trouble, Scots i can understand mostly but less than middle English, rest i don't understand anything i can maybe pick up on like every 10th word
I understand Early Modern and Middle English
Aha, and what does "no man ferre" mean
I know, I'm saying I knew what it meant before reading this text
Nah i'd say it more like 60%
This is a speech at the European Council
All the bad rep my country gets, you would think they would send somebody who can actually speaks English
[Vuk Draskovic] speaks on CNN news
vi ar AVR
I mean, it definitely can be a sign of culture
"Speaking Ancient Greek" - he might have been citing Iliad or something
That's still a cool example of being cultured, so may not be the best one for criticism
Welll uhhh
Bosnia
90s, expulsion of the Albanians, Turks and other Muslims in 19th and 20th centuries, expulsion of Germans after WW2
There's the expulsion of the Turks (i.e Sunni Muslims) in the early 19th century, culminating with the Čukur česma incident in 1862 (by which time there wasn't really a presence of civilian Turks in Serbia)
There's the expulsion of the Albanians from Toplica in 1878
The Balkan Wars had some massacres of Albanians as well, and Kosovan villages were razed and later colonized
In World War 2, depends on who we're looking at as the legitimate predecessor of Serbia
The Chetniks massacred thousands of Bosniaks particularly in Sandžak, the Partisans interned the German minority in Vojvodina in concentration camps before sending them all to Germany similarly to what happened in Czechia
And of course, in the 90's you have several massacres against Croat (mostly) POWs, you have Srebrenica where several thousand were killed and other smaller massacres against Bosniaks and the murder of thousands coupled with the displacement of more than a million Albanians in the Kosovo War
Probably the things we did in Bosnia and Kosovo, those are darkest stains on our history
Shit
That wasnt nearly as bad as the bosnian genocide
What did we do to Albania
"Serbs did it
" Is the best defence there is in ex Yu countries, as long as it's a bad thing
So why not lump this one to us too
And it says that these killings were more revenge than a regular crimes for no reason
I didn't know about this
But it seems to have been a back and forth between us for centuries with these sort of events
"say hungarian reports" ahh yes the one country that despised Serbia at that time
We should completely believe what they said
It's not centuries, though
It started with the expulsion of the Albanians from the Toplica region, at the time a majority Albanian region awarded to Serbia at the Congress of Berlin in 1878
It is centuries
A lot of Serbians moved from Kosovo during our migrations north and Albanians moved in and expelled and cleansed Serbs
We came back and did the same thing
Right and right before that they were massacring Serbs as part of the Ottoman army, so it is like he said, a back and forth
That's just not true
The Albanians were not on good terms with the Ottoman Empire at the time
They fought on the side of the Austrians and many of them were also expelled and migrated to Vojvodina after the Great Turkish War, particularly Catholic Albanians who moved to Srem and were Croatized
Albanians who did move to Kosovo in the following 200 years had no such intentions, and saying we did the "same thing" 200 years later is laughable already
Massacring military personnel in times of war (around 5 thousand Serbian soldiers altogether from 1876 to 1878) is light years apart from expelling tens of thousand of civilians (Čedomir Popov mentions 30 thousand) after the war was over
[as i said, too bad history isn't such a narrow thing] It was a back and forth
They mostly started it, then we caught up
Somewhat true but not completely, first they moved and then they converted later during the 18th century
As did many Slavs in the area, who also went on to abuse the Christian population
So it's not a Serbian-Albanian thing, and saying that the expulsion of 1878 is a revenge for those events is all kinds of misleading
Tried to find the source for the first three, listed solely as "Ivanov 2005", looked into some key words particularly this Yashar Pasha (Jašar-paša Džinić) and found [this about the 1830 massacre]
>Kada je u Babinom Mostu, Jašar-paša Džinić hteo (oko 1830) da poruši pravoslavnu crkvu, tome su se usprotivili Albanci iz tog sela
Oni su stali uz svoje komšije Srbe
>*(When Yashar Pasha Džinić wanted to raze the Orthodox church in Babin Most (around 1830), Albanians from that village opposed it
They stood with their Serbian neighbors
So yeah, I would say "too bad history isn't such a narrow thing".
EDIT: Just looked into the source on that one, it would seem it's from the book "Srbi i Albanci kroz vekove" (*Serbs and Albanians Through the Ages*) by Petrit Imami
>During the [Great Austro-Turkish War] Albanian Catholic leaders [Pjetër Bogdani] and [Toma Raspasani] rallied Kosovo Albanian Catholics and Muslims to the pro-Austrian cause
After the war, when Kosovo did not end up part of the Habsburg empire, harsh reprisals followed
Large numbers of Catholics\[2\] and Serbs\[3\] fled north where many "died, some of hunger, others of disease" around [Budapest] After the flight of Serbs, the Pasha of Ipek (Albanian Peja, Serbian Pec) forced Catholic Albanians in the North to move to the now depopulated plains of Southern Serbia, and forced them to convert to Islam there
\[3\]
>Conversion among Catholics in communities of Northern Albania involved males outwardly embracing Islam, often to avoid payment of taxes and other social pressures which in the Ottoman system targeted men while females of the household remained Christian
\[4\] Christian wives were sought by converted Muslim men to retain a degree of Catholicism in the household
\[4\] In 1703 pope [Clement XI] himself of Albanian heritage, ordered a synod of local Catholic bishops that discussed stemming conversions to Islam which also agreed to deny communion to crypto-Catholics in Albania who outwardly professed Islam
\[1\]\[5\] In Northern Albania, conflict with Slavs emerged as an additional factor toward conversion to Islam
\[6\] Sharing the faith of Ottoman authorities allowed northern Albanians to become allies and equals in the imperial system and gain security against neighbouring Orthodox Slavs

As I pointed out to u/Helskrim on another branch of this thread, relations were much worse with the local bureaucracy of the Ottoman Empire than with local Albanian civilians
Of course, every atrocity has its roots which aren't impossible to understand, quite the contrary, it's absolutely necessary
That doesn't mean it wasn't unfair, uncalled for and doesn't leave room for a sort of relativist "it was a back and forth thing" argument that the original commenter tried to make
The revenge was carried out against someone other than the perpetrator
And besides, on a local level, sure, there's always hate underneath the surface and societies turn brutal pretty fast
But I don't even think this is the case here, I think most of the expulsions weren't local skirmishes at all, they were ordered from high ranking generals
I'd be willing to wager they were possibly even unknown by the average Serb (as they are today, from my experience)
No no, I was probably unclear, I think the expulsions of 1878 were orders of high-ranking officials, and were relatively unknown at the time as they still mostly are today
I think we're in luck - they actually mention their reasons
>There were multiple reasons held by the Serbian government for the expulsions
Serbian authorities intended to expel the Muslim population, as they were deemed unreliable and undesirable that needed to be substituted with other inhabitants
\[1\] Retaliation for attitudes held toward [Christians within the Ottoman state] was also used as a motive
\[2\] Prime Minister [Jovan Ristić] wanted a homogeneous country, without Muslims and with a reliable population in the area
\[3\]\[1\] Ristić viewed Albanian populated territories as strategically important and representing a future base to expand into Ottoman Kosovo and Macedonia
\[1\] General [Kosta Protić] who led the Serbian army during the war, did not want Serbia to have "its [Caucasus] as an Albanian minority was viewed as a possible security concern
\[3\]\[1\] Supporting Protić's views for expulsion of the Muslim population, including Albanians, were most of the senior Serbian army officers and Prince [Milan]

"In 1878, following a series of Christian uprisings against the Ottoman Empire, the Russo-Turkish War, and the Berlin Congress, Serbia gained complete independence, as well as new territories in the Toplica and Kosanica regions adjacent to Kosovo
These two regions had a sizable Albanian population which the Serbian government decided to deport
The Serbian Army Commander insisted that Serbia 'should not have its Caucasus' and the Prime Minister argued that the Albanian minority might represent a security concern
In 1909, Serbian intellectual Jovan Hadži-Vasiljević explained that the major motivation for the 1878 deportation was also to 'create a pure Serbian nation state' by 'cleansing' the land of the non-Christians, as 'the great Serbian poet Njegoš argued'. Hadži-Vasiljević was here interpreting Njegoš rather loosely, as Njegoš work focused on the Slavonic Muslims and not on Albanian Muslims
The ominous implication was that Albanians, as non-Slavs, were not even capable of assimilation
While the Serbian state authorities repeatedly attempted to assimilate the Slavonic Muslims, they refrained from attempting to 'Serbianize' the Albanians
While both security concerns and the exclusive nationalist ideology influenced the government's policies, there was also some Serbian resistance to the 'cleansing' of the Albanians
General Jovan Belimarkovic opposed the deportation and offered his resignation to the government over this issue and journalist Manojlo Đjorđjević also condemned these policies and argued that Serbia should have pursued a policy of peaceful reconciliation towards the Albanians
In Toplica the Albanians were encountered, and we had nothing more important to do but to expel these warlike, but hard-working people from their homes
Instead of making a peace with them as the defeated side – they were without any good reason pushed across the border – so that they'll settle on the other side as the enemies of everything Serbian, to become the avengers towards those who pushed them from their homes
Despite some voices of dissent, the Serbian regime 'encouraged' about 71,000 Muslims, including 49,000 Albanians, 'to leave'. The regime then gradually settled Serbs and Montenegrins in these territories
Prior to 1878, the Serbs comprised not more than one half of the population of Nis, the largest city in the region; by 1884 the Serbian share rose to 80 per cent
According to Ottoman sources, Serbian forces also destroyed mosques in Leskovac, Prokuplje, and Vranje
" ; p.470
"The 'cleansing' of Toplica and Kosanica would have long-term negative effects on Serbian-Albanian relations
The Albanians expelled from these regions moved over the new border to Kosovo, where the Ottoman authorities forced the Serb population out of the border region and settled the refugees there
Janjićije Popović, a Kosovo Serb community leader in the period prior to the Balkan Wars, noted that after the 1876–8 wars, the hatred of the Turks and Albanians towards the Serbs 'tripled'. A number of Albanian refugees from Toplica region, radicalized by their experience, engaged in retaliatory violence against the Serbian minority in Kosovo
In 1900 Živojin Perić, a Belgrade Professor of Law, noted that in retrospect, 'this unbearable situation probably would not have occurred had the Serbian government allowed Albanians to stay in Serbia'. He also argued that conciliatory treatment towards Albanians in Serbia could have helped the Serbian government to gain the sympathies of Albanians of the Ottoman Empire
Thus, while both humanitarian concerns and Serbian political interests would have dictated conciliation and moderation, the Serbian government, motivated by exclusive nationalist and anti-Muslim sentiments, chose expulsion
The 1878 cleansing was a turning point because it was the first gross and large-scale injustice committed by Serbian forces against the Albanians
From that point onward, both ethnic groups had recent experiences of massive victimization that could be used to justify 'revenge' attacks
Furthermore, Muslim Albanians had every reason to resist the incorporation into the Serbian state

"Кнез Милан се у то време налазио у Нишу, окружен својим официрима. Посебно је био близак са генералом Костом Протићем и у конзулским круговима у Београду се сматрало да је владар под његовим утицајем. Генерал Протић је током рата, а и после њега, био главни заговорник политике исељавања муслимана, па и Албанаца, из Србије. Његове ставове делио је и већи део виших официра српске војске. Кнез Милан је током рата био сагласан са протеривањем Албанаца. \[Prince Milan at that time was located in Niš, surrounded by his officers
He was especially close with General Kosta Protić and the consulate circles in Belgrade was thought to be the ruler under his influence
General Protić during the war, and after him, was the chief proponent of the policy of the eviction of Muslims, including Albanians, from Serbia
His attitude was shared by most of the senior officers of the Serbian army
Prince Milan during the war, was in conformity with the expulsion of Albanians
\]"
The first is misdirected, though possibly unavoidable
The second is just plain evil, and made the hatred between the two nations much much worse
Attacking Bulgaria in 1880s, our King did it to stop their unification, the morale was so shit he had to lie to his own men
Occupation and annexation of Montenegro after WW1
It's the most fucked up thing because it was a giant stab in the back against our closest ally organized by a power-hungry delusional centralistic monarchy ran by depraved men
Here's a giant fuck you to the Karađorđević and Obrenović dynasties and all of their enablers
Seriously, the greatest historical mistake of us Serbs is the fact that we did not depose the monarchy before the 20th century
P.S. The "honorable" mention is the completely insane 1912 occupation of Albania
It's not as fucked up in my opinion because it's not out of the ordinary for enemy nations to fuck up each other
You massacred Serbs as well
I mean, Montenegrins wanted to be unified, same as the Serbs, they just wanted Nikola to rule, which, objectively doesn't make sense sense he's a King of a nation of 200k while Serbia at the  time had around 5m.
What's pretty big tradition with us Serbs is "Slava" it's basically celebrating your family's patron saint this is inherited paternally mostly, this tradition started as ancient Slavic pagan tradition where Slavs celebrated their gods but when Serbs baptized in 9th century our old gods were replaced with christian saints and that is basically how an ancient Slavic pagan tradition that was probably a core tradition to pagan Serbs adapted to Christianity and still persists to this day
>The oldest son takes over his father's slava when he dies, but until then he doesn't have one even if he has his own family
Najstariji preuzima od oca jer ulgavnom on ostaje u njegovoj kuci da zivi (barem je pre tako bilo)
Ostali isto je slave ali u svojim kucama
> What if you're a younger son who married an only daughter, do you take your father in law's slava since nobody's there to inherit his
Nije potrebno da je jedinica, uvek u okviru porodice moze da se dogovori da se slavi i slava zene (znaci i jedna i druga, slava zene ne bi zamenila muzevu slavu)         Najjednosavnije : muzeva obavezna ; zenina opcionalna
Thank you and just know if any Serb ever invites you to his Slava know that he respects you, since we have a saying "na Slavu se ne poziva" which means you don't call people to Slava so if you are invited that means that you are a special and respected person
I'm sure Italians have a lot that the rest of us can only envy
We say smrt in Serbian too
(Wiem ze po polsku jest smierc
btw "wiem" czy "znam"? nie jestem pewna
It means you should not expect an invitation, but you are expected to come
Not that people can't come
It's actually common to invite a person once when you first meet them because they can't know when is your Slava
But from then on, it's excepted from them to remember
That's why you "don't call people to Slava". On Slavas there is always a lot of friends and family
Ako zive sa roditeljima otac slavi, oni je tek preuzimaju nakon sto se ozene i isele (osim onog sto zivi sa njima)
A kontam sada, e to zavisi od porodice jer ne mora nuzno da znaci da ce im otac dati slavu
Sada kada razmislim mislim da sam bio pogresio, slava se uglavnom uzima kada otac umre mada i ne mora
TL:DR Uglavnom 80%-90% Nije nista konstanto i moze da zavisi od dosta toga (obicaja iz tog dela srbije, porodice, sveca, pa i samog domacina

Yeah this works for Serbia just as well lmao
Works for a lot of other countries too
The Sun has neuter gender "to Sunce", while the Moon has masculine gender "taj Mesec". The Earth tho is feminine "ta Zemlja". I don't think there's much story to why is it so
In Serbian The Sun got middle (there are like 3 genders when saying male female and like object gender
) gender and the Moon got male gender
When the Nemanjic dynasty was in charge
We were basically in charge of the while Balkans, Bulgaria was the only other Balkan country which had even close to our power
Then when the last Nemanjic died, a few years later we started falling to the Ottomans
I'd say people admire Dušan the Mighty's kingdom the most as he created [Dušan's Code] with some pretty advanced law institutes, also he conquered many Byzantine cities and created autonomous Orthodox patriarchate so he could proclaim himself tsar
This is seen as both best period and himself as most important historical figure, but sadly he died young and unexpectedly so his son inherited him and ruined the kingdom and also earned the title of Uroš the Weak
Probably socialist Yugoslavia, we had good living standards, and were respected by the rest of the world
End of WW2 up to 70's - maybe early 80's in Yugoslavia
Definitely Golden Age for Serbia
Golden age of Serbia was during the rule of tsar Dušan the mighty (1331- 1355)
Serbia was then the largest and most powerful country in the Balkans, with out own law codex (Dušan's codex) and a patriarch
It did, however, disolve after his death
On second hand, my parents would say the years before the breakup of Yugoslavia were the best time to live in our history (from around 1975-1990)
The state took care of everything (education, industry, medical care), the country was large, rich and respected
The golden age of Serbia could be considered under Car Dušan's rule
Yeah but him dieing started it
18 years later the battle of Kosovo happened starting the Ottomans invasion
The reason Serbia lost there was because when the last Nemanjic died, Serbia was greatly weakened as now it was near impossible to unite all the knezes
The Nemanjic's were the only ones strong enough to unite them
Actually, they do
I was shocked when I went to work for one italian company there
Working hours were 6-16 and there were no state control neither labor inspection

>The Balkans get upset over things that from my perspective are just stupid
I could say similar things about Western Europe
Brexit comes to mind and the amount of misinformation and foolishness that came out of it
If you're seriously calling the name dispute a 'crisis' it's clear that you're another westerner who doesn't know shit about the place they're talking about
I think Vucic (current Serbian president) is up there, but probably Milosevic (he probably isn't most hated, but most controversial for sure)
There's no collaborative hate for one person, people like Tito are contraversial
Meaning most don't care, some like him (boomers) and some don't. Even Nazi collaborator Milan Nedić is contraversial because yes he helped the Germans exterminate Serbias Jews but then again he saved and sheltered Serbs from the NDH and Nazies
Why is Vucic hated
It doesn’t matter if he did shelter Serbs
He still killed innocent civilians and that should not be forgiven just because he sheltered Serbs
The people he had killed were Serb too
He's contraversial there's no unified opinion
Happy cake day
You cannot sound like a native
I'd say impossible if you're not a native speaker of a Slavic language
Hard
I think grammar is a bit complicated for foreigners because there are 7 cases you need to learn, and every things has its "gender" so to say which you have to really master if you want to be indistinguishable from native speakers
If you learn that, I think the rest of  the grammar is easy
Pronunciation is manageable if you learn the sounds of characters because we have a phonetic system
Now accent is pretty hard for non-native speakers
They manage to master consonants to some level, but the vowels are the problem I think
They tend to stretch them out a lot and sometimes add some extra sound to them
So 2 alphabets, 7 cases, 14 tenses, 4 accents, and some leftover grammar from proto-slavic aside
Really hard I would say
Almost impossible
Yes you can speak fine Serbian, but we will always know you're not from here
It's because even our institution for regulation of the language (Matica srpska) has difficulties defying rules for conjugations
For example, I've seen officially 7 conjugation groups (like ar er and ir in Spanish) while one of them has 2 subgroups
And all of them have a lot of exceptions
That just goes for conjugations
Foreigners can also easily mix up dž and đ, and č and ć.
As a native Slavic speaker I still make strange mistakes when speaking czech: I use naj- instead of nej-, I add "je" to 3rd person singular and "jsou" to 3rd person plural in past tense, I say "jezyk" instead of "jazyk"...
So grammar can be quite complicated to grasp
>4 genders
I wouldn't count masculin animate and masculin inanimate as two different genders tho
Like, yeah, some things are different, but it's still masculine gender, no
I would use seljaci instead of seljani, but we get the point
Not even then
You can tell the region where someone is in based on accent
And not to say ekavica/ijekavica speakers trying to speak the other one: adding j or removing it when it shouldn't be done and so on
Yes, if the pay is the same as working 5 days a week
I would like to thank France for helping Serbia during the WW1, Albania for letting our Army cross their country and Greece for welcoming them on the island of Corfu
I would like to thank Russia for supporting us throughout the years and Romania for being the only country that we didn't fight against
Thank you Poland for giving me my granny, pierogi, sernik and kisiel
Russia for helping save our ass in WW1, and for trying to help us in '99
Also Greece for harbouring nearly all our troops on Corfu in WW1 and for refusing to participate in '99
Greec for not bombing us in 1999, and of course i want to thank every country that does not recognize kosovo
We love you too and thank you for harbouring basically the entire Serbian Army and a substantial amount of civilians during the WW1 on the island of Corfu and other places around Greece
Also supporting us during 1999 bombardment and refusal to participate in it
We can understand other South Slavic languages like Bulgarian/Macedonian and Slovenian with some effort but it's easier for some (northern Croatians understand Slovenian much better than south Serbs who understand Macedonian and Bulgarian better)
We can get the gist of Slovaks and Czechs if they speak slower and Polish is a bit harder for me personally
Russian/Belorussian/Ukranian is the hardest, I understand very little when conversing with a speaker mostly I understand a few words here and there
>spoken polish is complete gibberish for me
Yes
For me Polish sounds like a German trying to speak Russian while having a stroke
They are simply dialects of one language, like US and UK english
Bularian and N. Macedonian are very close, Slovenian is a bit harder to understand farher south you go
Same here, feel like we have more similar words

Belgrade
don't get me wrong, the city is nice and all if all that you look for is spending money and clubbing, but except for that, there is nothing special about it
overly hyped tourist trap imo
I meannnn
do I actually need to write anything here
Croatia most probably, I think they feel the same way
Historically, Bulgaria for sure
Nowadays Croatia
Croatia most likely
Croatia, Bosnia, Albania
Croatia and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Croatia by far

Ye, I hope we make this tensions into an rivalry banter in the future, we don't need to fight, especially since we have to work out our economies, industries and politics
Yes it pretty much is
Romania is our best neighbour politically
We were always allies (WW2 is an exception) and they are one of the rare EU and NATO countries that don't recognize triggerland
And Romania
We're pretty good with Romania
Montenegro is a bit contraversal seeing that theres a literal civil war going on with The Montenegrin gov and 30% of the population wants to steal our churches and riches,while the other 70% is in full revolt for 5 months straight
Yeah, I think the same
Albania is too inferior to Serbia to even speak about it
(in terms of economy)
Nah a rival has to be on the same level as you
Of course
Greece is our biggest ally along with Russia, but I was talking about neighbours (countries we share a border with), my gyros brother
Felt it in Serbia, I hope that there are no casualties and that everyone is okay

I didn't feel anything, for reference I'm from Vojvodina (Novi Sad specifically) which borders Croatia
I'm in Novi Sad Serbia, my boyfriend felt it a bit (he thought he was falling off the bed), I didn't feel a thing and slept through, though I slept through when the city brigdges were being destroyed by bombarding '99 too, so that doesn't mean I lot
I too hope everyone is okay in Cro, stay strong and stay safe

I like it here in Serbia, I know a lot of people are moaning about our country being underdeveloped, but in my opinion I think that in the past 5 years, we've come far
I like it but I'd like to experience living in another country aswell
Yeah yeah i love it here in Serbia high wages normal people, cheap prices
Of course not in lying i'd rather move to usa than live here
Well, a lot of our historians and politicians said: "we have the best position for peace, and worst for war", and sadly that theory has been proven many times during the history
Geographically and economically speaking, Serbia's position is best possible, but when it comes to war, that can be a huge problem
It was more popular some 20-30 years ago, now it's somewhat a rare sight
Niva still holds on, though, especially in rural environments

A foreigner in /r/serbia asked how to separate trash while in Serbia
They got [this answer]
I gave my friend some rakija to take home
She went for her wallet to pay for it
DO YOU HATE ME THAT MUCH
Lmao separating trash in Serbia
so he showed up before you told him to come
so he showed up before you told him to come
when do you have dinner then
Good try, but no
You are not my long lost friend
You might be my future friend
And yes, you can have some rakija for free
Just you have to share first glass with me
Rakija is drank slowly and with enjoyment
I've gone to someone's house plenty of times when there was no food except for snacks

Realistically speaking Putin still does karate, plays hockey and was a KGB agent so likely him
Orban seems pretty tough but sadly he's quite short
Either Putin or Vučić (Serbian president) because he is like 2m tall
Boyko Borisov for sure
Just because someone us overweight doesn't mean they're not strong
True but his martial arts evens it out
Or I'm just informed about it and curious, stop making it be a media thing
Oh you just can't imagine the cult of putin made by pro-government media here
I learned he plays hockey from an Oliver Stone interview which is amercian media that I found online and I know he's a KGB agent and does karate from Wikipedia, also online
Quit embarrassing yourself

Hard to say
I'm a Hungarian minority born in Serbia, and my parents, grand parents and great grand parents were also all born here
Yet, somehow, occasionally I don't feel *"Hungarian-enough"* as someone actually born and raised back in Hungary
At the same time, I'm also clearly not a Serbian by blood and I don't exactly feel like a part of their club either (not all the way, anyway)
So, while nobody discriminates me, I feel caught in the middle in a sorta *"neither here, nor there"* situation - on a personal note, also not helped by the fact that I have a half sibling from a parent's previous marriage (to a Serbian) who has a Serbian name and surname and identifies as such despite of his mixed parentage, who really isn't the closest with us and mainly hangs out with other Serbians and while I respect his choice, it also makes me feel even more internally alienated and adds to the weight of the impression that something I can't quite point my finger at is amiss in this whole story
I hate people here because a lot of them are delusional, but I couldn't be anything really if I wasn't Orthodox
We are drinking nation, we just drink without thinking about it
Basically everybody in the country gets drunk about once a month
But not on beer and all that shit
We drink real drinks, wine, ракија, whiskey, etc,
Never saw one
One of the funniest things I saw, related to US based evangelical Christians, was when few of them came to Serbia with idea to preach to the people
On the streest
In English
In the town where Constantin the Great (also known as the first Christian emperor) was born
Most of the people laughed their asses off
One time even paramedics were called because people thought that wannabe preacher had some sort of seizure or that he escaped from mental institution
I have never seen one in Serbia
Most of billboards are filled with commercials or political party advertisement
Macedonian/Bulgarian and Slovenian
After that all the other Slavic languages barring Polish maybe
Macedonian, Bulgarian and Slovak
Czech is, in comparison to Slovak a bit more complex to understand
Russian and Macedonian because it's really similar
I don't count Croatian, Bosniak or Montenegrin because we share the similar language base
You can understand some Bulgarian, Russian, Ukrainian, Macedonian and probably Czech
But Russian, Bulgarian and Ukrainian when they talk a little slower
Well Bosnian and Croatian if you are counting those as seperate languages
If you aren't, then Macedonian, Bulgarian or Russian
Can relate
Vojko V - Kako To
In Serbia it's probably [Pljeskavica]
I'd say most people don't have one, but it's not odd if you do own one
One of the perhaps unusual practices that's common in the Balkans is waving your flag on a wedding day, I'd say that's the most common reason people would own one
No, why would that be strange
it's odd if you don't have one
It’s not odd, but when someone has a serbian flag at home and it’s not for a wedding, then people would assume he is a serbian nationalist etc, right-winger
What
I'm not sure I know one person who has a flag
I'd say it's rather rare seeing it if it's not an official building
I don't recall ever seeing a flag on a private house or window in the city where I live in (Novi Sad)
It's sad because I actually really love our flag but don't want to be associated with those fucks
It might be a little exaggerated, but I know a bunch of people that have one, including me (Sremska Mitrovica)
To be fair, Americans also put them on their homes and local businesses, I'll never get used to that
I agree
Hehe pretpostavljam da je istina negde na sredini, ali što se ovog drugog tiče stvarno ne mogu da se setim da sam ikad videla u Novom Sadu zastavu istaknutu na nečijoj kući ili na terasi
It's [*Hawkeye*] probably
It was taken in 1914 and depicts Dragutin Matić, a Serbian scout, during the Battle of Drina
The photo pretty much symbolizes WWI in Serbia, especially the [*Great Retreat*] even though it was taken a year earlier
How did you have photographers in 1860s when your country has been made in 21st century
I'd be greatly disappointed to find out that pic wasn't taken in Croatia
Now it makes sense, thank you for correcting yourself and have a nice day
Everything being political
"Hey, he's a good actor
" -Nooo he supports the X party, you can't like him
"Oh, they finally filled the holes in this street
" -But it's stolen money, how can you say that, do you support the Y party
etc
Littering
It's insane how people don't care about trash on the streets, and even get mad when you tell them to pick it up (one guy pulled out a knife on me when I told him to pick up his trash)
Corruption, although it doesn't directly affect me
Unbelievable amount of corruption and stupidity
We have never been flower of transparency and efficiency but what is happening in past 8-10 years is just ridiculous
We might be different countries, but we share the same problem, prijatelju moj
Hi there :) I almost feel Greek, just need a dictator and his 40 thieves
No it isn't. What kind of advice is "you'll live in an apartment worse than a prison cell but you will meet wonderful people
"? Why can't we live in a decent apartment that doesn't endanger our health AND meet nice people
During the fall of Milošević, there was a news broadcast instead of a Sunday morning cartoon block
I still remember being confused about where the Flintstones cartoon was
Not really
We had a war 22 years ago, and another one 4 years before that
>We profited off helping the NATO campaign in Serbia for a fast track to the EU and NATO, supported by the British
I don't say this proudly at all, but it's what happened, and it happened during my lifetime too
I've met people with VERY strong opinions about that
What is the general opinion about the 1999 bombing in Romania
Where exactly are these ideas of restoring our empires are coming from
What news do they serve you in Ukraine about Serbs
Do you really think we're waging war
Cause Serbia has good relations with all of its neighbours
Would you consider Russia a threat to Finland
Serbia lost 60% of its male population and about 30% overall, it was quite devastating
Sorry to inform you that your opinion couldn't be further from the actual truth
We had enough wars for no reason already
No one here is willing to lay their lives for such  idea
Nor we are thinking about it or care for that matter
Whatever you heard, or you think you've heard is pretty much wrong
And fuck modern Russia
Many of us actually do not like it at all
There are strong historical ties, that is true, but that doesn't mean that we actually support what  they are doing nor that we are preparing to go to war
That is just insane
An interesting perspective, thanks
Yes, we use "jutro" for area measurment of arable land
To compare: 1ha = 1,75 jutro
In Serbia, we have two official alphabets: cyrillic (traditional) and latin
I used to think writing in latin alphabet was "cool", but now i prefer cyrillic and think it's so wonderful and unique that we can expres our language in 2 alphabet
I did not really like our Epic Poetry when i was younger but only recently i realized how beautiful, poetic and badass it is
But .. but how can it be a type of soup
It's like saying beans are a type of soup, at least it feels that way to me :)
Danish is super difficult, but also kind of likable in a way, from my persepective
In the Balkans one must make a distinction between folk music (which is generally often region-specific and often a real cultural heritage) and modern folk-pop nonsense that is a cheap copy with drum machines, synthesizers and autotune,
it's called [digraphia] To me it is second nature
i also realized it is kinda cool later in life that I can switch alphabets with no effort
The body of works of Serbian epic poetry is massive too:
There are literally thousands of poems with hundreds of verses that used to be sung from memory accompanied by traditional instruments describing historical events, battles, kings and heroes
I am not even an ethnic Serb, but I must say it is a priceless cultural treasure
Actual poems of heroism and adventure of poetry considered by Grimm brothers as one of the most beautiful in all of Europe
Eastern Roman Empire
Ottoman Empire
Austria (Austro-Hungary)
Montenegro
Russia
Yugoslavia too but I don't know if it counts
Honourable mention of France
Turkey (Ottoman Empire)
Austria - Hungary (both equally)
Bulgaria
Greece (Byzantium)
Russia (Russian Empire and later on communists)
Honorable mentions to all EX Yugoslav countries, especially Croatia (although we didn't have much shared history before 20th century)
Eastern Roman empire
Ottoman empire
Bulgaria
Hungary
Austria
That's why it's an honourable mention
I was mostly referring to the fact that France was a big inspiration in Serbia when it came to organising our society and especially the laws post Ottoman occupation
Same with Serbia to an extent
>"give me 100000 croats and I'll conquer the world"
We have a similar saying that Napoleon talked highly about Karadjordje who was the leader of the First Serbian uprising against the Ottomans
France throughout history up until relatively recently was a big ally of Serbia and in WW1 they even saved our troops in Albania and transported them to Greece
It would all either be occupied by Russia, Germany, or the US
If it is Russia their might be one or two independent countries,  others none
You think I want this shit
10% of the world will be nuclear wasteland
You think I want that

That and Neda Ukraden meme, which is hilarious
Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro
Sadly, we are Europe's most disfunctional family
In Serbia we call many our brothers
Russia- as orthodox, Slavic nation as us and as an ally
Montenegro- although politicians try to divide us, in heart and soul we are the same
And Greece- as a brother country with who we fought against the Turks, Bulgarians, Austrians and Germans
Also, only NATO country that didn't bombard us in 1999
Russia as a fellow Slavic country, probably the closest one through that
Montenegro since we are nearly the same people but the politicians (cough cough Đukanović) try to divide us
Greece because we are both strongly orthodox countries and they are the only NATO country which didn't bomb us in '99
I also think Russia as we are allies and Slavic
Also Greece because of religion
Serbia is also probably close because of religion and you were the only NATO country that didn't bomb us in '99
>Most Albanians would say Croatia since we’ve had a similar history
Of having constant war with Serbia
how can it be kosovo when kosovo is serbia
Our countrie's history is wierd, we are either trying to wipe the other off the face of the Earth, or being friends
We already had 2
Yeah, other slavs too
But these 3 are closest family we have
Our feelings for Croatia are, lets say mixed
Shadow of war still stands over us and many didn't forget it
Unlike these three, Croatia generally isn't seen as a brother country

When groom come to take bride (from her house) he need first to shoot of apple with gun (usuly apple its on tall tree or house)
A little long post:
Apple Shooting:
Where the father in-law puts an apple on the highest tree in the bride’s yard, where the groom then has to then shoot it
The bride is unable to leave the house until the apple gets shot
Drinking from the flask:
Before the wedding day, the Buklijas, a young man from the groom’s side, will invite guests over to drink from “the special flask”. This flask is called the Buklija
These guests will then drink from the flask and decorate it with money
Boy or girl:
Before the wedding ceremony, the bride will drink from a glass, toast, and then throw the glass
If the glass breaks, it is said that she will birth a boy
However, if the glass stays intact, a girl will be birthed
The one and only bride:
Brides are absolutely not allowed to see other brides on their wedding day
So, if you are sharing a big venue space with another wedding, you will want to be sure that the bride is covered when out and about
It’s believed that the bride that is seen will get married, but will also die
Hiding garlic in your bosom:
In a Serbian wedding, the bride fights bad luck by hiding garlic in her bosom
So, be sure to discover a lovely perfume to adorn yourself with, as you wouldn’t want to emit the aroma of garlic on your big day
Diverting evil eyes:
Once again, you can fight evil on your wedding day by featuring a Zarac
The Zarac will be dressed in a wreath of peppers and hold a whip that will divert evil eyes from the happy couple
Leading the way:
When it comes to a Serbian wedding processional, the Barjaktar will lead the way for the wedding party by featuring a banner with an apple on top of it, along with being adorned in towels, rosemary, and flowers
Protected with a mirror:
For even more protection, the bride should carry a small mirror to frighten demons with their own reflection
Hiding beauty:
In Serbia, the veil is more than an accessory, as it will hide the bride from evil spirits, as well as her beauty from other men
No Pearls:
A bride can adorn herself with many beautiful jewels on her big day, but never pearls, as they symbolize tears
So, opt for diamonds, rubies, sapphires; just no pearls
Bridal Wreath:
From necklaces to bracelets, the bride has an array of lovely details to choose from for her bridal beauty
However, she must wear a bridal wreath
The bridal wreath allows the bride to stand out, protects her from evil entities, and also symbolizes fertility
Buying of the Bride:
A very unique Serbian wedding custom is the “Buying of the Bride”, where the bride is sold by her own brother, and bought by the groom
Serbian Cinderella:
During the “Buying the Bride” custom, the groom’s brother will put money in the bride’s shoe and spin in it three times
Who Will Run the House:
During the wedding ceremony, as the couple says their vows, the bride has the option to step on the groom’s foot if she pleases
By doing so, it means that she will supposedly be in charge, and run the house
The Pulling of the Nose:
Once the wedding reception begins, the bride will ask all of the single ladies “Do you want me to pull your nose
”. It is believed that the one that the bride pulls by the nose will be the next to get married
An Apple for the Men:
Instead of the tossing of the garter, the groom will cast an apple that has coins embedded in it over the bride’s head to all of the single gentlemen
And, whoever catches it should be the next to get married

Unlesse groom is bad at shooting, becuse first few shot every one is hypped then with each miss it get more silent and boring, and when its silent and boring it becomes aqwured
Yeah we also have bouquet throwing ofc
Ty man, in serbian you dont have spelling like in english or franch (one leather one sound, no "silent" leathers in words, imagine if all words you pronounce like hit)
Cyrillic |Latin | pronunciation
&#x200B;
Ђ ђ |Đ đ  |like Ј in jukebox (little softer)
Ж ж | Ž ž |like SU in Pleasure (like JE in je m'appelle)
Љ љ | LJ lJ |Not similar to anything (Say L (like in word Let) followed fast by  J ( and thats pronaunced like Y in You)
Њ њ  | NJ nj | Like NE in New
Ћ ћ | Ć ć | Soft CH sound
Ч ч  | Č č | like CH in chair
Џ џ | Č č |Like J in just
Ш ш  | Š š | like SH in shock
&#x200B;
And here is just funny laters  Д д (D),  Л л (L),  Ф ф (F),  П п (P),  Ц ц (C), Г г  (G)
I am stuudying right now, in 1h when I get on pc I will show you all "funny" lethers and how you pronaunce them
We have few of thouse č = ch
Cyrilic and latin are bought accepted (guverment papers need to be in cyrilic)
And schoole books are also in cyrilic
Bring back [this one] (Pre WW1)
Idk why it reminds me of mint, and I LOVE mint flavored everything, so it's a great flag
10/10
Because red white and blue are considered "Pan-Slavic" colors agreed in Prague Slavic Congress, based on Russian flag
Honestly I think it's a great idea to have all Slavic people have one similar thing just so we remember that we were once same people
Red white and blue are great example of "unity" between us all, that's not as obvious
However if some countries would like to change a color of their flag, I'd consider another Slavic Congress to discuss some other way to represent symbolism of Slavic roots (tho I don't think it's ever going to happen)
*Some countries did not choose these colors (Poland, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Belarus and Ukraine)
Actually Russian flag was inspired by Netherlands' back then :)
That sounds insane to me, a relationship between family shouldn't be that between a landlord and the one inhabiting the house
That said if you have a job it's generally expected for you to pitch in, but I seriously doubt you'd get kicked out if you didn't.
Harsh, Rough, Precise and Direct, so yeah kinda like German of Balkan languages all other ex-yu and Balkan languages are noticeably softer
I first saw Basque as a written text, and when I searched on youtube and actually heard the language it sounded completly different than I expected
As you said it sounded so much like Spanish
Yeah that's why i love when Croatian girls speak
Yeah although Serbian has a lot more consonants
My god, I thought you guys were messing around until I used Google translate
Google translate says: Shred the unleaved (leafless
) reeds, bristle the crosspiece with a worshiper
I mean, it doesn't make that much sense, but I thought, who knows, maybe it's an old Polish saying or something
But it does recognize the actual words
Interesting, thanks for the clear up
That makes sense, thanks
Thank you Greece for everything you did for Serbs in WW1
Thank you for respecting and remembering our common history and maintaining the friendship
Thank you for still being good hosts when we travel there
Thank you Greece and Romania for always being good friends to us especially Greece and as well thanks to Greece for amazing cuisine and giving Europe and world civilisation and many great minds
Thank you, Russia for standing up for us in WWI, when the war started and when you demanded from the allies to evacuate our troops and civilians from Albania before they could be totaly anihalated
Thank you for assisting us in liberating our country in WWII, and not overdoing your welcome
Thank you Montenegro for centuries of being bros, and particularly for Battle of Mojkovac
Thank you for your patience
Thank you, Greece, you are our greatest ally
Thank you for receiving our army and people in WWI, for the hospitality then and now, when we came to your beautifull country in summer
Thank you for being on our side, even when the whole world was against us
How could we ever repay our debt to you
Thank you, Romania, for being our best neighbour and ally
Thank you, Austria, for centuries in which you received our refugees and migrants, for being safe harbour for our scholars and scientists, our first inteligencia
Thank you, France, for your help in liberating and feeding our people during WWI
Thanks Bosnia and N.Macedonia for keeping up with our shit all these years
Thank you, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany and Turkey for not killing all of us when you had your chance
Thanks Albania for letting our army pass through your country to reach safety in WW1
Thanks Greece for always being on our side and having good food with even better holiday destinations
Thanks Romania for being great neighbors
Thanks Russia for supporting us in the UN
Thanks Belarus for supporting us in the hardest of times (1999)
Thank you Montenegro for being the most badass country to exist
Thank you Russia for helping us in the fight for independece from the Ottomans, joining  WWI after Austro-Hungaria declared war, not recognizing Kosovo as a state
And VODKA
Thank you Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Moldova, Bosnia, Belarus, Ukraine, Slovakia, Spain and Russia for not recognising Kosovo as an independent state and for your continued support in the issue
Id like to thank Montenegro for being such a bro
Thank you for being good neighbours, too
And thank you for the respect and comemoration of our victims from the Arad Fortress in WW1
This is something I've found out only recently
Lots of love for Greece
Bulgarians don't hate Serbia for like more than 100 years
They are actually really friendly towards Serbs probably because we speak very similar language
Not going to hate on people I consider brothers just because some organisation doesn't like you
Why are we frenemies
Yall fought each other in Balkan War 2
And we will never forget your captain refusing to go on a bombing mission towards Serbia and Montenegro (he got a medal for that recently) or Greeks generally causing havoc in NATO by sending relief to areas they knew would be targeted thus saving lives by diverting NATO planes from bombing
It goes deeper than Russia invading Ukraine
I've seen people on various subreddits that are straight russophobic to Russians
>Nobody would be russophob, if you just stop invading neighboring countries and using your natural resources as a political tool to subjugate other countries
Do as we say,not as we do lol
Wow, that's nice
What's funny
Is it really that hard to believe not everyone is hateful like Albanians
I'm sure you have never been in Bulgaria
Eh that really isn't a frenemy
A frenemy would be like us and Bulgaria in Balkan War 1
We weren't really friendly but we had a common enemy
Serbs and Romanians are generally very friendly so i don't see us as frenemies
Russian invasion of Ukraine is the result of NATO completely surrounding it I think that's pretty obvious
>assholes
If you use this term to refer to Russia it can be used for literally any country in history
Wasn't Poland also an asshole when they burned down Moscow
Because that's how they are taught
There is not a single neighbour they don't hate
Not a single one
Serbia, Greece, North Macedonia and Montenegro
>except Hungary our brothers
Magyarisation, WW2 occupation and raids on us wasn't very nice to be honest
What are you talking about they tried joining and were turned down
I live in Belgrade and I keep the doors of my apartment locked
Two reasons - I really do not want to have any uninvited guests and second, my car could get out
EDIT: you guys made me chuckle
God damn autocorrect
Personally I leave my door unlocked during day, but locked when everyone go to sleep
However this is not a general truth and I can't really say anything
Everyone do as they wish I guess
You must have a pretty roomy apartment
In Belgrade as well and its the same for me
I hate our culture of stepping into peoples homes uninvited
Wait, we have this culture
I've lived in Belgrade all my life and have never heard of this happening
It is more common in rural areas, plus it depends on your neighborhood, but I know many people who are just fine with it
Serbian Latin: Džon mejd hiz vej to a tavern tru d dark forest, onli tu fajnd aut dat hi forgot d mani
Serbian Cyrillic:
Џон мејд хиз веј ту а таверн тру д дарк форест, онли ту фајнд аут дат хи форгот д мани.
Dzon mejd his vej tu a tavern tru de dark forest, onli to fajnd aut det hi forgot de mani

"Džon mejd hiz vej tu a tevrn tru d dark forest, onli tu fajnd aut det hi forgot d mani"
Џон мејд хиз веј ту а таверн тру д дарк форест, онли ту фајнд аут дат хи форгот д мани.

It’s so sad

Aww that's a shame :(
Make sure to use the next possible opportunity, you won't be disappointed
Not really answering your question but kinda similar:
To say "I don't care
", we say "baš me briga
" which actually means "I really care
" (It's always used sarcastically)
It's a way of life here
From lovest to highest levels
I think we are among top ten countries in the world regarding the corruption
Think Russian model od curruption but on a scale that it's public and nobody even denies it
Our government is so incompetent they can't even do corruption right
Unfortunately if you don't want to wait in the hospital, bring chocolate, coffee, drinks or even money to nurse or maintenance stuff and just like that you are almost 1st in line
Obviously this isn't just for hospitals, but it was an example
When it comes to politics, we are very corrupted
Here it's a part of life, it's a branch of government
Sombody said we need a ministry *for* corruption
I can't tell you how corrupt is my country, because you didn't ask that question on the LBOŠ form, and you need to add your birth certificate and citizenship along M24 form
However, if you help me out with some fat envelope, which I'm in need, I may be able to answer that question on Tuesday
Extremely
Everything is corrupt
You can buy off a police officer for as low as 20€.
You need to pay doctors to get treatment
Laws are not followed nor enforced
Same here in Serbia
Do you think anything might change for the better with your new president
Happy cake day
[Bora Dugić - Tren (Moment)]
[Bora Dugić - Običan balkanski dan (Regular Balkans day)] this one perfectly captures the dynamics of an everyday life in the Balkans and incorporates various Balkan sounds into one
[Sanja Ilić & Balkanika - Simonida] A song that kinda captures the tragedy of the Serbian people during the Ottoman occupation
The song is about an icon of Queen Simonida, daughter of Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and wife of King Stefan Uroš II Milutin
Her icon was damaged by the Turks by scratching out the eyes, a typical method of icon defacing
Wow, I actually understood most of it
And what about ["A ty myla"] and "[Gei sokoly] those are among my favorite ukrainian songs
Are these are not classics in the Ukraine
Good one
From Bulgarian songs I prefer [Moma se s roda proshtava] but this one is also great
Can you give alternative link
This one doesn't work
So I live in Belgrade (1
3 milion)
The city has nice parts , but I wouldn't call it pretty
Grimey and rough around the edges , but with character is how I would describe it ( being destroyed and rebuilt 40 times does that to you)
Pros :
- Nightlife is great , most places work until the early morning , and the atmosphere in clubs and partys is great
- Food is also good , while the variety isn't really there , traditional Serbian restaurants are amazing
-Bunch of roads next to the rivers (Sava and Danube) where you can walk, ride your bike
etc
- A lot of cafés , if you're into that stuff
Cons :
- The city desperately needs a metro system
The roads that were built through the city weren't built for so many cars , so the existing public transportation system isn't effective enough
- There isn't really a bunch of nice places in nature around Belgrade
- The wages and costs of housing are not proportional
The average wage is around 350€ , and a decent , nothing special 1
5 room apartment rent will cost around  250-300€.
Miloš, Mihajlo, Aleksandar, Milan, Petar
Pretty common names today aswell
Stefan, Uroš, Dušan, Vukan, Nemanja, Milutin, Dragutin, Đorđe, Aleksandar, Petar, Mihajlo, Milan, Miloš.
Arguably also Danilo, Nikola and Petar again
(altho Njegoš is also a name nowdays)
Men: Caslav, Ratomir, Vlastimir, Prosigoj, Viseslav, Konstantin, Mihajlo, Vukan, Zavida, Nemanja, Rastko, Stefan, Vladislav, Radislav, Radoslav, Uros, Milutin, Dragutin, Dusan, Petar, Aleksandar, Milan i probably missed some
Female: Jelena, Milica, Ana, Ljubica, Olivera some other definitely just can't think of them
Nothing strange about most of these names are common except a few like Zavida, Prosigoj that stand out a bit
Nemanja, Stefan, Dushan, Urosh, Lazar, Alexander, Petar, Mihailo, Milosh, Nikola, those are the first that came to mind
As for girls:
Milica, Natalija, Zorka, Jerina, I don't know anymore now
Yeah, we had a long monarchist tradition until the red plague came
Clodomir
That sound Slavic as fuck, does anybody know etymologi of this name since France isn't really close to Slavic lands
Omurtag is raw big dick energy name
Đorđe too
And that's only modern times, not to mebtion Nemanjić dynasty, or pre-Christian rulers
Also, disputedly, Petrocić-Njegoš dynasty
>Yeah, we had a long monarchist tradition
Yeah, all 150 years of it
And befor you say, no, there is no continuity between Nemanjić dynasty and modern ones
What about the Russian monarchs, would sound foreign but some more than others
How much is Alexander a foreign name or Catherine
I mostly went for the modern Kings
So we have no ties with the Nemanjic state
We are a completely different Serbia than they were
Okay
Ulrich sound badass to be honest
A kdo byl Jiří?
We don't have continuum with medieval Serbian state (or rather states)
That doesn't meab we have no ties with medieval or pre-chriatian serbs
Just as britiah monarchic trafition starts in 1066, so does ours start in, well, 1833 (I think thats the year), wehn Miloš Obrenović became knjaz of Serbia, and the title was hereditary
I respect that
I just think that there is no reason we shouldn't be proud about medieval Serb states
That's why I think we have a continuum, we as a people have just formed various states throughout history
Ofc we should
I never sad we shouldn't be proud of who we are
And yes, the sates were formed by the same people
Modern serbian state is the product of serbian revolution of 18th century and victories in WWI and WWII
I just think we shoulf ideologicly distinguish between medieval states based in fudalism and modern states based on modern ideas
We were the second state in Europe to abolish feudalism btw:))
Just goes to show how progressive we were back then (tho Miloš had that moment "eithsr me or the constitution
Absolute monarchy or nothing")
Well he was an intelligent ruler, gotta give him credit for that
Credit where credit's due
Dora teaches Spanish in Serbia if I remember correctly
Which is kinda weird because Spanish is not a popular language for studying here, it'd be better if they changed it to English instead
It is indeed weird - English would be much better
The thing is we don't really change much when it comes to TV shows/movies
All the movies and TV Shows are original with subtitles (which I love, btw - I don't want some random lame voice actors to ruin an amazing show for me - this way you can still get some jokes that would be lost in translation otherwise)
Only kids' movies and cartoons are dubbed
I've tried both, super bock is slightly better, but the best beer I had in Portugal was Coruja
Nonono, not if you toast it
When ot melts, it drains DOWN
This is an important question and it deserves some data collection
Just because we are a third world country does not mean that we are poor, but that we did not choose a side in the Cold War
I got reminded and instantly got suicidal thoughts
I can't even explain hov aids the todays mainstream music scene in Serbia is
Its basically infinite 69 copycats or wanabees,and their demographic is mostly 10-15yo kids
Luda po tebe
Haide opa
And in Denmark the IDs have no picture
To be fair it serves as you healthcare card and other things but basically it's the only thing you have
Yeah, I lived in CPH only
Merak (turkish origin)
A state of mind where everything is just right
You go to a local pub to drink beer with friends, live music is playing for your table, you have nothing to worry about, you are happy that you are in that momeny with those people
It is merak for you
The name Siniša(Sinisha) Is the one I dislike the most
I'm not sure why but all annoying kids are named Siniša.
Siniša: little son
JUST NO
Names like Lav, Mia, Vanja (this one is unisex) are just repulsive to me
Same here, I know a Gypsy family who named their children Armando, Valentino, Izabel and Rolencija
In my entire life I have never heard of anyone else worldwide being named Rolencija, or Rolencia
Don't forget Sandokan and Kasandra
Oh, definitely
Met quite a few Kasandras, haha
Wirelles power transfer, earthquake machine, electric supersonic plane, Ray of death
Yeah, Tesla was a prototype of mad scientist
Sorry to bust your bubble but neither of those are Croatian inventions
Dactyloscopy - mid 19th century, first used by Sir William James Herschel in India
Torpedo - 1866 by British engineer Robert Whitehead (albeit it was done in Rijeka)
Parachute - late 18th century by Louis-Sébastien Lenormand in France
Thermos or vacuum flask - 1892 by Scottish scientist Sir James Dewar
Not sure if it counts as an invention, but what [this guy did]
It isn't? I really thought everybody has one
That would be nice and I think everyone wants it, but it is much more complex
Airplane network is Scale free network (  while railway network is Random network, which means it is easy to add (or remove) one airplane from Budapest to Barcelona in almost any time, while that is almost not possible with trains
Trains require much more stable routes and traffic, which would probably happen if it was connected system, but still
Top eleven: football manager
Scorn, it's supposed to be published soon
Underrail
Hellion
Genesis rising: the universal crusade
Call of heroes: pompolic wars
There's this up and coming game that's getting a lot of traction, called Scorn
A first person survival horor game that I see quite a few YouTubers covering
Pathfinder Kingmaker was also made by a russian studio i think
I think it quickly acquired a cult, If not giant, following
I was obsessed with the show even if I was confused most of the time
Same
yeah
you're welcome
Ditto <3

paying that money to drive for like an hour  is not worth it
Next, nectar and swisslion are very popular I would say
From energy drinks booster and definitely Guarana, it's really amazing drink
Cedevita rocks, but I've never tried Pipi, don't think we have it in stores
Could you explain what it is
Oh great, I'll have to try it
Thanks
English because the translations suck
I don't really have a choice, I haven't played any game that's translated into Serbian or Croatian, but even it was, I'd play on English, I guess I'm just used to it in video games
It's never avalible, so i just play in English
If games that have no voice acting I'd try in Serbian
Sadly that doesn't exist but I prefer English anyways
English becouse translations to Serbian are aids 99% of the time
Kudos to AoC2 for an actual good translation
If there is good translation yes
English all the way(with subtitles)
Synchronization is a work of the devil
They are mostly old (40-80yrs old)
They are either ultra chads or Vucic's sandwich-eaters, there's nothing in between
Hahah, yeah I might have exeggarated it, but what I meant was there's no young people there
Some factory probably exploded badly when got hit with depleted uranium
I think [that this] is at about the same level as that one
And some Japanese cult tested a nuke in the outback
To Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia
Sorry for being jerks and idiots
We had a great thing together and we didn't know how to appreciate it until it was gone
To Montenegro and Macedonia, yes we accept your independence and we don't want to force you into some grand union ever again
We've learned our lesson
To Kosovo, most of us have made peace with your independence, and we don't hate you
We just ask that you have understanding about the worry regarding the monasteries
In Serbia we envy you a bit
You've had such a hard time in WWII and after that with the soviets yet still you've manged to build great economy and some really cool skyscrapers
We've had it easier after WW and yet only thing we were able to do was to fuck up a country that if remained whole, today could rival some of the richest EU countries
I think that is just a human way
I sure do love me some milk
I've been a drinker my whole life, but now I'm losing my tolerance :( If I could I'd drink milk all the time
with that many non European origin people I really doubt you're even in top 10, let alone highest
We use
Bogu iza nogu or Bogu iza Leđa, meaning behind God's legs or behind God's back
Also Nedođija, meaning Neverland, likely not having anything to do with Neverland from Peter Pan
In Serbian we have "Vukojebina" = place where wolves fck
To all health workers in Europe and around the world, thank you
You are the real heroes, and when this all is over, we will own you big times
It's ok to be affraid
I am affraid for myself and people I care about
Yet, despite all this, you all keep working, and for that we all are thankful for this
We are white/european, but that doesnt mean we colonized anyone or owned slaves or anything like it
Just throwing this out there
In Serbia some people call Italians "žabari" what means frog eaters
"Ko se nije sakrio, magarac je bio" - The one that didn't hide is a donkey
Spreman ili ne, dolazim
Spremni ili ne, krećem
Спремни или не, крећем!
,,Spreman ili ne, dolazim
We also say lopata for shovel
Da, na to misli, ni ja nisam odmah skapirala
Croats or Bosnians using our words would sound pretty weird
I wouldn't find it offensive I'd think they're just trying to make me understand
Serbian spoken in Serbia is Ekavian while the one spoken in Montenegro and Bosnia is Ijekavian
This means that words that had Old Slavic sound [yat] (ѣ, ě), are pronounced different (vreme - vrijeme, mleko - mlijeko, lep - lijep)
Other than that the are no major differences in vocabulary or grammar
I don't mind anyone speaking different dialect, but unfortunately I have witnessed a few times, in public transport, people telling Ijekavian speakers to go back where they came from
It is annoying when they don't sometimes, but not to bad usually
But there are some places who I can't even understand if they talk like they normally do
As long as we understand each other it's no problem
I don't think anyone minds
Ijekavian is spoken in Western Serbia too, and it's official just like ekavian
>For instance my friend was thrown out of a store in croatia because she used the serbian word for bread (unintentionally)
Jesus wth
For instance although this is more know
In Croatia and Bosnia they say grah for beans but we say pasulj or kruh for bread and here it's hleb
In Croatian they also say for instance časnik for officer (like a military one) but we say oficir
There's small differences that aren't noticeable like saying Europa for Europe in Croatia but we say Evropa with a 'v'.
That is true, but in practice Ekavian is taught in schools and all media is in Ekavian
While I have met older people from Western Serbia who speak Ijekavian, I must say that all of my college friends from that area (Prijepolje, Priboj, Užice) spoke Ekavian
Yeah the pasulj instead of grah thing is kind of a meme at this point everyone will know what you mean if you say either one
My Great-grandmother who's from Croatia always said grah and as a kid that confused the hell out of me I thought she was speaking a different language
Why is using grah strang
My parents and grandparents mostly used grah for pasulj, I thought it's normal in all Serbia
I have just noticed now when you have mentioned grah is used more rare lately
From mine experience it's usually Swedes who are secluded
Have you heard of Bosnia
We're definitely not, in fact we're very good friends
when you say people, it’s implying that all Serbian people support Slobodan Milosevic and politicians like him which is false
I for one do not support his actions that he had made during the 90s but for those who did support him and still do I will never understand
Because as you said he was primarily involved in many deaths in the 90s and was also responsible for not only the deaths of both Albanians and Serbians but was also responsible for kicking Albanians out of there homes in Kosovo which is completely wrong and should in no way be supported
The same however can be said about how some Croatians support or supported certain politicians that were heavily responsible for the deaths of many people and where many people were forced to leave their homes in the 90s. I am talking about Franjo Tudman and politicians like him
I don’t care what someone’s ethnicity is, I don’t care what someone’s religion is, if you’re responsible and capable of murdering innocent civilians in cold blood and leaving many families displaced without homes to go to, you are heartless, despicable, disgusting, low life of a human being if you can even call them a human being
And those people who support politicians like that are sick and are as despicable as those politicians
3 presidents they each take turns who's gonna be president of the presidency, 3 constituent peoples of which 2 want to separate and everyone wants something different for the country so serious decision making is impossible
I’m pretty sure the mostly the old also support Milosevic as well
Could you please elaborate on how Franjo did good
I’m curious to know what Serbian politicians you believe are worthy of being supported
It can be past or present
Most if not all Yugoslav politicians made terrible decisions which doomed the whole of Yugoslavia
We use the Digitron brand name instead of the word calculator, because it has become the most famous company that produced calculators in Yugoslavia
There is a food company called "Aleva", and it was the first producer of minced paprika here
So instead of minced paprika, people tend to say Aleva paprika for every minced paprika they see
Rizle, rolling paper brand, we call every rolling paper rizle now
We use the term "labelo", from the brand Labello, to refer to lip balm
Yes
Eurokrem - Eurokrem is our version of Nutella, but we call every chocolate sauce Eurokrem
Džip - from Jeep, a 4x4 vehicle
Sellotape - Cellux
UHU for glue stick
Digitron for Calculator (Digitron was actually a company that produced calculators in Yugoslavia)
Coca Cola for basically any type of cola
Even in LIDL
And that one is even made in Bosnia I believe
Some English fuckwit asked me does my family own Hercegovačka Gračanica church in Trebinje
Shame
It would be perfect example of natural selection
Yeah, we say "unutrašnjost", which literally translates into "the insides", for pretty much everything that is not Belgrade (plus two larger cities)
While it's a generally accepted term and used on TV and such, it can definitely be used to with a derogatory or condescending connotation to talk down on people who are from smaller places and the stigma that usually comes with it
Belgrade is to Serbia what Paris is to France, people like to act smug and like they are better than the rest of the country (especially if their family comes from Belgrade)
The other part of the country can be called provincija if you want to be politically correct but there is often more vulgar term "vukojebina" meaning hellhole, literal translation "place where wolves fuck", mind the language
Also I know people born in Novi Sad like to call people who come to live there "dođoš" which has sort of look down on feel to it, meaning "the one who came".
In Serbia we have the term "unutrašnjost" which translates to "the insides" or "the inner parts".
Everything outside Belgrade is Provincija or Unutrašnjost
Except maybe Novi Sad, never heard anything about Novi Sad being refered like that
Basically only if you live near a border since there's small check points for locals
Generally almost never, we're not in the Schengen area so you gotta wait at the border if it's a busy day
My mom and dad go to Bosnia each month to refuel our car because it's cheaper
We were under Ottoman Empire for a long period so we picked up some Turkish words like peškir (towel),  alat (tools), bakar(copper), bubreg(kidney), burek(basically a pie made from meat), ćuprija(a thing in front of a house where you usually park your car), čaršav(sheet), čarape(socks), česma(water thing that you drink from), čelik(steel) etc
Don't quote me on this one but in Serbian word "Tepsija" meaning "casserole" came from Chinese, and word "Kovceg" meaning "Chest" came from Mongolian i suspect these words came via Turkish
Oh my God
I wouldn't have ever thought
Same in Serbia
It's for general education, we call it "gimnazija".
I never knew what it means or heard someone use ćuprija
air beater*
Whaaaaat, that's crazy
Varoš is also in Serbian, but kinda archaic and I don't hear it's used
Same with fruštuk, we know it means breakfast, but no one really uses it
You never heard someone say "ko ne plati na mostu, platiće na ćupriji" or "Na Drini ćuprija"? Or the town called Ćuprija
isnt that "most"?
I just love Polish "plażing" as a word, it's such a mood
Yeah, I think so
Really
I thought all the Serbs were running off to Austria not Switzerland
Both: 34

Tho this is whole population thats older than 15 years in 2011 so this is most likely different than now but still interesting nevertheless
I'm 13 and I live in Serbia aaaaaand
a lot of my classmates don't know how to do most things so they ask me to do them
BTW, I'm very computer literate
They can't even just get into Start or save a PowerPoint presentation
Зелезницка пруга (zeleznicka pruga), means train/rail track
Železnice is Railways in Serbian
A friend of mine went to a team building in Russia, they flew 2 hours away from Kazan with a helicopter in the woods and brought a doctor with them just in case
Anyway, freezing nights, hot days and oversized insects all around were worth the incredible scenery
Depends if he is a Serb it doesn’t matter where is he from
Really
I thought  the french have something against the spanish
Maybe I was misinformed that there is discrimination
My mom lived in Paris  when she was a teen, she told me that then  discrimination existed
Romania, we've been neighbours for centuries and yet never went to war against each other and we always helped each other as well in medieval times our noble families often married into each other
Romania, Greece, Russia - best ortodox brothers
Russia, it started when they helped us in fighting for independence against the Ottomans
Iiiiiii don't know man, we love you as a people, but as a country weeeelll I mean
Oldest has to be Greece though, we were on good terms with them since ever
Best neighbours ever
When were we friends
Oh really i didn't know that, here in eastern Serbia there is a lot of Vlachs/Romanians and we always lived good with them and marriages between Serbs and Vlachs are pretty normal
We've been fighting Greeks almost whole medieval period tho
Yeah, same goes for us
well, except the Black Sea lol
We love you
It wasn't out of hatred, we just expanded on each other
Even when we conquered each other we had respect for the opposing side
Ye but that doesn't make us oldest friends, and since we currently arent friends, i dont think it counts
You're forgetting the centuries of oppression under the Ottomans, so i don't think we are friends
Even before that Bosnian Kings were warring with Serbian empire/kingdom over territory
When the Empire fell they tried to sieze land
Its easy formula if you are a Slav Serbs don't get along with you and since you aren't Slavs and Greeks aren't as well we get along just fine
They are
Special
It's funny how we all know which country you are talking about
A girl at my uni has a red shirt that just says 'ketchup'.
Lol, good one
Hey neighbor, we're all in similar shit
Belgrade is the same but I think our guy will develop into a megaturd, might just become worse
We're pretty good in growing thieves and assholes here
Corona virus
Cases are doubleing every day,but our government doesn't seem to give a shit
We here haven't closed anything
Cases are doubleing daily,but the government doesn't give one
You could have translated that
TLDR: Everyone was wearing shoes made of fur with the hairy part inside to keep warm, while the Romanians inverted so the fur was outside to ease navigating the snowy mountains
Thus they became hairy-soled people
Yeah same here, kids being 14-15 and drinking like its end of the world
Here it's basically the norm
Pretty much all high-schoolers drink, and many smoke
Very very popular,it usually starts in middle school,yea in middle school
yea same here
After the last month elections, Serbia is one of two countries in Europe with no opposition in the parliament
The other one is Belarus
Only political orientations here are selfishness and greed
"Name Patronim Family name"
Meaning the given name, followed by parent's name (usually the father, but you can use mother's name too
Only rule is to allways us the same name), and then family name
Name and surname only
For paperwork there is also a patronymic
Nobody uses that
You always get your surname from your father
Our surnames came from the name or profession of one person from distant past
First step is to get the name (Jovan) or profession (Kovač - blacksmith)
Make it into a possessive form, because they are *his* kids (Jovanov, Kovačev)
Change the word into a diminutive, because the kids are little "versions of him" (Jovanović, Kovačević)
This is the reason why so many of our surnames ends with "ić" (similarly how there is "ski" or "ov/vna" for other Slavic languages)
First name + Surname and every single Serbian surname ends with "ић" (ic)
Same here
Just baptized name is usually your given name too
In Serbian we have somthing similar
It's not official in documents, but if a woman has her maiden name, - eva is usually added at the end
If she has her husbend's name, then - ka is added at thw end
So if we have Markovićeva, that means Marković is her surname, while if she's called Markovićka, that means Marković is her married name
So when a woman has 2 surnames, for example Marija Markovićeva Jovanovićka, that would mean Marković is her surname, and Jovanović is her married name
This is rarely used today tho
Does czech law allow special/non-czech characters in official documents for naturalized citizens
I've seen people with serbian/croatian surnames (ending in - vić or - ić), so I wounder if they can keep thair name's spellings
Like, would someone called Đorđe be requiered to change his name spelling to Ďorďe upon naturalization
Probably yes in some countries (Russia, Bulgaria), but it's not general rule
Although in Serbia -ov surname is rare (we add additional -ić), it would be grammatically correct to add -a for female although in Serbia we don't.
Markov - Marco's (son)
Markova - Marco's (daughter)
>Fyi, our keyboards do support almost every special character that can be written in latin alphabet
Ours too
Same rAlt as switch for spetial characters
But I can't get used to czech keyboard, whit numbers being á é ě í ó and so on
Thankfully, everythibg can be written easily
Well, almost every day
And č, ž and š are part of our alphabet (guess where we got it from )
I would fight the Turks, I guess
Maybe a merchant considering my city was an Austro-Hungarian trading hub at the time
Austrian then, it was even given a status of a free city by Maria Theresa
Yes, if China wouldn’t squeeze us by the balls
So, no
Just like the rest of the world
Im used to help some family with airbnb hosting, here in serbia
So imagine my shock when a couple of Bulgarians, a country we share a border with, and have had some major interaction with throughout history, asked me WHETHER DOGS ARE EATEN IN SERBIA
So, during a zoom call to a client in the UK, the lady asked if we have mosquitoes in Serbia
We all said yeah, we do
she then asked if we feel them biting us at all, or are we just used to it, as we are natives
I swear I imagined us all as a tribe in the Amazon rain forest
Is that a thing anywhere in europe now
It is real mountain, people think it is not
Thst is the first time I've ver heard thst rumor and I've lived here for 25 years
Fazon
I literally don't know how would you translate it
It can mean anything from "joke" to "trick", but I mostly see it used as a sentence filler, which might be why I don't know a proper translation
Wow, I didn't know that
I know there is a lot of hungarian words in serbian, I guess I shouldn't be surprised fazon is present in both
Funny how it has no overlaping meanings
Thanks for the insight
The so-called [Toblerone building]
Yes, you can chose between your religion class (my school had Orthodox and Catholic aswell as Greek Catholic teachers but this depends on the region as south Serbia has also muslim teachers) and civil studies
They mostly teach you about the tenets of your religion and depending so I went to Orthodox class and it was basically an excuse to chill with friends and bore your professors about aliens especially since the class grade doesn't go to your grade point average
You choose between Religious education and one other subject about society and stuff
So yes if you want to, no if you don't want
It's a good solution imo
And I should say that most people nowadays choose the other one, so religious people are a minority (in this age group I mean)
In my class of 23, 5-6 of us chose RE
Hey that really depends, in some schools most kids choose RE
If I understand it right it's mostly societal pressure
I'd remove this subject from the school anyway, it's much much better that you learn religion in church, right
There could be some kind of sunday school, or some kind of public outreach or something
Men like to kiss each other on the mouth when they meet
The Germans especially
It's the European version of howdy neighbor
Yeah, over there it's just Russians waiting to kidnap you
(I think some Americans do actually think that Eastern Europe is like that)
Most likely Niš or Novi Sad, while I personally prefer Niš, I think Novi Sad would fit better as a capital as it's a little bigger
Although, Kruševac was the capital city at one point in Serbian history, and it's located in Central Serbia, but I don't know if a 60k population city would work well as a capital
If you believe what our politicians say, very important
Even more than some member states, that is why they are pressuring some issues because they can't wait we join in
It's not, not anymore at least
The EU as it stands doesn't want us nor has need of us
Unlike Bulgaria and Romania who technically border Russia via sea and could have fallen into the Russian sphere of influence that simply doesn't matter for Serbia considering right now we're surrounded by NATO and EU members anyways
The EU sort of abandoned us and just doesn't need us right now but if it was serious about expanding we'd be the first on that list
Likewise Serbia seems to have abandoned any hope of joining as it furthers away from EU standards
Probubly Czech or Slovak (ó gave them away)
Yeah, but we don't use ó, while they use š, ž and č
But this is mocking of english spelling (or lack there of)
Gross oversimplification
As wise people said, every problem has it's roots in certain event that happened in the past
Balkan history is deeply correlated with it's geostrategic position, which was between (at the time) powerful Middle East and Western Europe
Later Russia joined the game, so we had Austria-Hungarians, Turks and Russians all trying to assert dominance in the region, which greatly influenced strategic position of nationalities  in then poor areas of Balkan that were occupied by both Turks and Austria - Hungarians
This is basically the core of modern day controversies and problems Balkan had and still has, not "primitive Balkaners arguing for no reason whatsoever".
The core of the problem in Balkans was it's geostrategic position
Looking at the map, it's very obvious being between Middle East (which was very powerful and influential region) and Western Europe would cause a bloodbath in the region
You can also add Russia in the mix, which is the reason why Caucasus struggle (being inbetween Middle East and Russia)
As most of the Balkan was under Ottomans for centuries, main goal of every major nationality being occupied was creating a state
Problem was national identities weren't so strong back than and lot of locals were purposefully assimilated and tortured by Ottoman autorithies
When wave of nationalism striked the area in 19th century, lot of those nations got their long waited statehood (Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Montenegro)
However, problem was there were still some areas which were influenced my multiple nationalities, such as Macedonia (which was a mish mush of Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian customs)
Throw into the mix Croats, Slovenes and Albanians that were still ruled by Austria - Hungary when wave of nationalism striked Europe, lot of ethnically mixed regions which are claimed by multiple nationalities, and it's obvious why there were (and still are) so many disputes and clashes in the region
I can go on for days, but this is basically in a nutshell
In Serbia there are usually two shifts in each school
First shift starts at 8 am, second starts at 2 pm
Class length is the same as yours, and there's also 5 minute breaks between classes, but after 2nd class we have a lunch break which is 20 minutes long
That goes for both elementary and high schools, but somewhere there are schools that only work from 8 am
We never have more than 7 classes per day, bc first shift would get mixed with second, and second shift would finish it after 8 pm, which is a bit late for the school kids
Here in Serbia we go to school from 7:30 am to 1:30 pm, one class is 45 minutes in-between classes are 5 minute breaks except between the 2nd and 4th class(15 mins), those are "morning classes" it's basically the same for "afternoon" classes but they start at 1:30 pm and end at 7:30pm
The student switch the "shifts" once a month
I'm in 8th grade in Serbia so it's typically like this without isolation:
Wake up at 7am
Go to school at 7:30am
School starts at 8am
Class, little break, class, big break, class, little break, class, little break, class, little break, class, go home at around 1:10pm
*1  class is 45 minutes long, little break is 5 minutes, big break is 20 minutes
Eat lunch
Study until around 3pm or so
Do nothing the rest of the day
A day while quarantine is:
Wake up whenever
Watch TV  1:15pm-3:30pm  because thats how we go to school now I guess
Check Google Classroom if there are any tasks we need to do
If not, do nothing
If there are, do them and then do nothing
No, we don't have mixed shifts
I only said they would interfere with each other if there were more than 7 classes in a day
Our schools have a big amount of students, and you can't just put them all in the school at the same time
In elementary school, there were 6 classes in each grade, and we have 8 grades of el
school
Eg: when the school starts, the first three classes of all grades have subjects from 8 am, and the other three classes of all grades have subjects from 2 pm
In high school it's a bit different
In my school there are four years of studying
And, for example, in the first shift, there are first and the third grades, and in second are second and fourth grade
Shifts are changed weekly, so one week you go to school in the morning, and other week at noon, then again in the morning
This is the easiest way to describe it, I don't know if you'll understand completely, but I hope you get it
Bruh I've seen the word for the first time yesterday and now this
In Serbia, we give presents on New Year (1
january), but Christmas is celebrated on 7
january (like Russians, cuz our Orthodox church still uses old calendar)
New Year is usually spent with friends tho (like partying and that stuff), and Christmas is a very close familly day with usually no presents, but usually expensive feast takes place, its sort of like US Thanksgiving (tho some people still go to party for Christmas, which is nonsence)
7th January
We are fasting 40 days before the day
We basically don't eat any animal product, be it meat, fat, milk, eggs
The exception is, obviously, fish
On the Christmass eve (Badnje veče), we (formally) go to woods and chop a branch of oak (Badnjak)
Nowadays, you go to nearby shop and just buy a piece of it
That oak is brought to the home
Later that day, all the neighboring homes come together at the local church and we put all the oaks into the flames
Early in the morning everyone goes to church
Also, by tradition, you can't stop fasting until the special guest called Položajnik comes, which is also early in the morning
He should bring apple with coins inside of it
By tradition, this person brings luck, happiness and piece to the home
The person is then offered non fasting food, and he should take the first bite
Only then can others continue with their normal eating
On the Christmass day, when two people meet, person who is first to greet says "Hristos se rodi" (Christ is born) to which the greeted person answers "Vaistinu se rodi" (He is indeed)
Edit: how could I forgot
On Christmas day, we also throw wheet seeds at each others
January 7th
It's celebrated only religiously beacuse we celebrate new year with presents and such
Belgrade and Novi Sad mostly, NS specifically because of Exit Music Festival
Bulgarians frequently come to the area along the border (Stara Planina, Sokobanja spa, Pirot, Bosilegrad, Dimitrovgrad, Rtanj mountain)
I am not sure how many foreigners come to our mountains Kopaonik and Zlatibor but they're very famous tourist spots among Serbs
For me personally, I think I can name all 50, and brobubly even map most if not all of them
Capitals, however, are different story
Without googling, I could probably name two thirds of them, maybe more
I know even where are some of them on the map and maybe even a few cities
Let's give it a try
Main, Newfoundland, Pensilvania, New York, Washington, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Arkansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Michigan, Illinois, Oregon, Nebrasca, Connecticut, Delaver, Indiana, Georgia, Virginia, Missouri, Maryland, Idaho, Hawai, Alaska, Alabama, North Dakota, South Dakota(?), Wyoming
I could probably scrap up some more, if I shake my brain up a little bit more
Mississippi
We know where are the big ones (by area and popularity) like TX, NY, CA
All others are just familiar
That is if someone said Arkansas, we would know that it is a state, but not much more about it
However we do know about geographical stuff, like deserts, mountains, rivers etc
How do you now witch is witch
Ich nicht spricht deutschland
Hungarian
Hands down
All the vocals and accents are crazy
I can say every person that is not directrly from Serbia cannot speak our language completely right
Even some Serbian people can't speak Serbian right
Spanish and German gave me headaches
you learnt latin but struggle with Russian
I don't live in the EU
I actually don’t like EU but i think in different form it would be amazing
We don't have any really special idiocy, except the well known 'we are the people of the heaven' and 'at that point in history people in our court used forks and the west used fingers for eating'. But choose *any* of the regular idiotic , evil and sick beliefs and I know people who believe it IRL
Which is completely nuts
We're nuts
Regarding the last thing, about the detergents, wasn't there a woman from Czech Republic a couple of years ago that was fighting for a law to get companies to export the same, western europe quality of stuff to eastern europe, and I THINK she specifically mentioned Poland
And I think she took some yoghurt and chocolate from Nestle as example
I remember hearing something about it, and hearing about how she had some strong evidence, but I didn't know it was a conspiracy
Sorry for confusing English in advance, will post source when I figure out how to look for it
Edit: Found it, I meant on this:
It's a shame when people spew crap like that, since 5g really is dangerous - for our wallets
It's marketing wank for something that is better done by doing 4g properly
But no, these fucks think it's.. what, gonna deactivate their crystals or some shit
I saw that video, that's so insane lmao
Almost every arthical there is has a Serbian translation
Often when I can't remember the word in Serbian, I go to wikipedia in English, and change the language
same in serbia, tap water is drinkable but it has a hard feeling to it, almost hard to swallow hahaha
You squeeze the bottle, if it is rock solid, it's probably sparkling
Helps when you're in countries where you absolutely don't know the language
It's very drinkable in Niš, where are you from
it is drinkable in prishtina but it tastes very hard
i prefer to drink bottled water like prolom
Cultural and linguistic erasure in Subotica, Serbia
The northernmost city in Serbia, it has (or used to at least) a majority ethnic Hungarian population
Due to its cultural ties to Hungary, historically, it was always more Central European in culture, religion, language, government and architecture
Since the unification with Yugoslavia and especially since the creation of Serbia, the Hungarian people have been segregated and provoked
I am saying this as a person of mixed Serbian, Croatian and Hungarian descent and I do not think Subotica should join Hungary or sth like that, but I think that an approach of more equal representation for all ethnic groups in the city would be better
Zaragoza
Never heard of it before and I'm surprised since it looks like a very pretty city, other than that I've noticed I don't know many other spanish cities either, gotta work on that
You have been to Kosovo but not to Serbia lol that's a rare one (unless you count Kosovo as a part of Serbia idk what's your view on that)
Cool, have you enjoyed your time there
My advice for learning any language is to learn the alphabet first then words then phrases
Listen to the locals talk as much as possible
Just imagine that you are a 1 year old and you are learning your native language
Go to the south so you don't have to learn cases
What, in Serbia when someone is even trying to speak our language we get so excited someone is even trying so we continue talking to them in our language
What
It is not that hard to spell in french
Comparing to english spelling writing/ spelling in french is a piece of cake
Thank you lord for TV5MONDE
Idk i started learning it when i was 7
I got used to ait ais est e, etc
Verbs aren’t easy i still go to nouvel observateur to look up the conjugation of some irregular verbs
What do you think of the spelling on[this instagram page] ? Are younger generations starting to spell simpler
I mean is there a tendency to start spelling easier the language
Ugh I hope that severity will change someday soon
I agree it is actually the most beautiful language on earth
Alcohol consumption
Even devout muslims in Europe drink a lot
'Why did you leave the door open
Were you born on a raft
'Don't leave the window open, wind (idk how to translate promaja) will kill you'
Thats the most common saying in every country
I watched a show on Viasat History that covered strange historic laws, and the host tested out them by both handling salmon suspiciously, even asking the police whether they knew about the law (they didn't), and by walking into the Parliament in a suit of armour
He was like
carrying it around the street with a suspicious look on his face and he was like
a spy
"Write as you speak and read how it's written"
Well we speak as we write and we write as we speak, so yes
We have a proverb, 'write like it's spoken, and speak like it's written'. We learn it in the first grade of elementary school
It's the basis of our language
100% of the time
Our alphabet is phonetic
Yes
Always
Every letter has it's own sound
For example c is always c no matter what comes after (unlike Spanish ce and ca)
There are no exceptions
It's 100% phonetical
Exactly
Phonetic spelling is the whole point of our language
Wow that is fascinating I had no idea the č ć distinction was a problem for Croatians
The only one I can think of is "tamo gde i car ide peške" which translates to "there, where the emperor goes on foot"
I call it the OFFICE
Kenjara (shitter) as well
We have a similar story in Serbia, but one this one is historically true
King Uroš I was married to a French princess Hellen of Anjou and she was ill or sad (I can't remember right now) so he planted thousands of lilacs which are still there today in a valle known as Dolina jorgovana(Valley of lilacs)
There's a barbeque festival in my city every year and usually the first night there's tons of fireworks
Plus the music gets so loud that you can hear it from distant parts of the city
A drunk Serb wanted to fire a canon in 1804 in the middle of the night and ended up killing the Ottoman officer who commanded the local army which fought the Serbian revolutionaries
Yes, Gamzigrad
It's near Zajecar and it's fairly preserved too
It's the Felix Romulian palace I think
There are also busts of the Emperors there too
A lot, there's even 2 sets in my city
I live in Sirmium which was the capital of it for a period
The first one is outside and can be climbed on, and children like playing on it
Though, now they transformed it into an external stage for festivals like Folk Fest, concerts etc
The second one is well preserved in a closed area which can be looked at through a window in a cafe or on a street
Both of these are ruins of 2 castles that probably collapsed or something
Besides my city, there's Gamzigrad and other places intended for preserving these ruins
There are roman baths in the center of my city of Čačak
There are a lot of major once all around the country as well
Naisus aka modern Niš among them
Yea, there is a few ruins, also the capital Belgrade is a roman city, along with Nis, Sremska Mitrovica, Zemun ...
What an understatement for Serbia
14 Roman emperors were born on the modern territory of Serbia, we had several Roman cities, the largest being Sirmium which was coincidentally 4th capital city of Rome
Felix Romuliana was a complex of palaces and resorts built by Galerius
There are also several cities that were further built by Romans, most notably the capital, Belgrade, or Singidunum as it was called back then
Remains of the original fort can be seen on the Belgrade fortress as well as numerous of marble statues and structures
Here in Serbia if you are not at home the delivery guy is not going to leave the package because you have to sign for it
Or you will get a paper notification left in your mailbox if the package was delivered by state owned Pošta Srbije
But two months ago there was a huge outrage with state owned Postal service because packages from AliExpress were stolen by its employees
And since packages weren’t received by those who paid for them, they complained to AliExpress and got their money back, but that left sellers without money and the goods
So sellers just decided to stop sending stuff to Serbia or to use DHL only as a delivery option, which is extremely expensive
No, packages are delivered directly to you and if you're not home they leave it at the post office where you have to retrieve it from
Basically all the other comments
Same rules are applied everywhere
Everything is done in person, and it must be signed
If you're not there, you're left a slip that you can take to your nearest post office to pick up the package
Y'all ever seen Podgorica
Big yikes from me
Zvolen definitely, specially during the winter
Agreed, Sofia was probably the most bland Capital I've ever been to
That's just my experience, especially as a kid I remember how boring and bland it was
It literally felt exactly like a commie block in my city but the whole city is like that and extremely hot in the summer
Counterpoint: Belgrade is in no way boring
It's chaotic and a pain to live in, but exciting as hell
The coast, that's where half of Serbia goes to vacation at least
I agree with you on that, but I don't see how this has to do with Podgorica
Yuuuuup
It's driving me and everyone else in here insane too
The way I cope with it is that I walk everywhere
I change flats frequently so I can always live near things I need to visit frequently (Currently: girlfriend, job and gym), and use the city transport only when going out of that area to see friends or events
As a Novi Sad native obviously I'm gonna recommend my own city
If you show up during Christmas (January 7th) it's gonna be super cheery
There's plenty of museums to visit and places to check out and especially it's a city where people like to relax a lot so spending a lot of time in a coffee shop during the winter is great
There's also a huge mall in the city for all shopping needs
It's pretty flat which is why I like it over Belgrade (and it's home) so there's no hills and you won't get too tired of walking around
It generally probably will be quite cold so dress warmly
As for safety I don't think you have to worry anywhere in Europe for that really
Novi Sad is very safe and so is the rest of Serbia
Night life is great, Novi Sad is Europe's Youth capital this year I think
I believe there are frequent meetups for travelers as we get loads of tourists but I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly where sadly
Food is pretty cheap compared to Western European countries
I’m pretty sure most Eastern European countries have fairly cheap food
Bread here is 20¢
Bread is ~0
50$ here
Cigarettes
For us here, that price js high (3 euros for marlboro red) but I think for the rest of Europe it is quite cheap, correct me if I’m wrong
i heard that in the UK, a pack of cigarettes costs 10£
Malta says hello to used RHD cars
This is true, I was always amazed at how cheap water in Greece is
Haahahahaahaahahahhahahahaahahhahaha
crtani - drawn (cartoon)
sladoled - sweet ice (ice cream)

Yeap, can confirm sounds slavic
When I lived in Romania, first few months i was so confused how can I almost get the context of what people say sometimes, without ever knowing any word of  Romanian
Since i also speak Italian you can imagine level of confusion
Pihtije, čvarci, krvavica, jagnjeće sarme
Oh, we also eat almost all entrails of an animal, my favorite is the brain of the fier baked pig
I love pihtije/hladetina
Altho I think these are not the same thing
Škembići are awesome
can you price some random things
anything that comes to mind, i want to see how pricy are you ;D
Can I copy your homework
Know what I will just do it
In Serbia everyone uses it, and it can be spelled like OK/Ok (most common), okay, okej or oke
I wanted to exclude brackets but i was afraid it is to much
Long story bro
-"How is a common country with our Croatian brothers going
-"Uhm we didn't really get along, I guess
Yeah about that pan-slavic country idea
"Soo the country changed its name and borders like 20 times and fought a lot of wars and now everyone is leaving and we are fucked"
Same old,same old
But you still employ Bosnian workforce
Hey, at least we didn’t stole your Transylvania
You see, this is actually sixth  or seventh state, after your departure
What a dumb and false statement with absolutely no historical evidence to back it up
• Serbia won WW1 I don't think it was expected for them to give up power to those that fought on the opposite side like Croatians
• Serbians were the most populous ethnic group by a huge difference
Croatians weren't satisfied with what they had and wanted to be on equal footing as Serbs by territory even though they were in a minority
• Stejan Radić wasn't killed because he was a Croat, but because he also offended Račićes wife
Was this justified, no of course not and he got arrested for it but Radić as I said also advocated for policies that would give Croatians large amounts of power despite them being a minority
Only after this was the dictatorship called because of the differences in views that were so radical you couldn't agree on anything
• You also completely neglected to mention that Croatians got exactly what they wanted in the end in the form of Banovina of Croatia but that wasn't enough for them
• Is this how you run a pan Slavic state
No obviously not, people should have an equal say in the ideal world but couple the fact that Serbs would have to give up a large amount of not only territory but power (considering they were WW1 victors) to their former enemies, it was ludicrous
• This only proves my point because the first thing Tito did was split core Serbia into Macedonia and Montenegro, give a large amount of Serbian territory to Croatia and Bosnia and cripple the Serbian government by separating it into two provinces
A Yugoslavia can't exist if Serbia isn't a cripple old man
Likely but I guess we'll never know
I was just trying to prove my point that calling Yugoslavia a 'Greater Serbia' is ludicrous
The entire Balkans, but specifically Serbia and Bosnia
Bulgaria as well
[Ub] Serbia comes to mind
We should do this with Slavic languages too
Speak portuguse fluently having lived in Brazil for most of my life
The French one was about a city(maybe region) of an area of France
Understood most of it
Spanish was very easy, about a J.K Rowling book
Italian was also suprisingly easy
It was about the soviet communist party
Romanian was about a battle during the war of the Roses
Surprisingly hard
I mostly knew what it was about because it mentioned houses York and Lancaster and Henry Tudor
Catalan was about a swimmer
Harder then spanish but still not hard
Galician was very interesting, it was just like portuguese but with weird spelling
It was about a Mozart symphony
Foreign but it's definitely saddening, it's more of a mark of humanity than anything and in itself it's a great historical and architectural treasure
Everyone else in Serbia is hating on Belgrade and people there
But the joke's on them, Belgrade is nothing else than a microcosm of the whole Serbia, so they're hating on their own behavior
To my Serbian ears your sentence sounded like "hey man, do you have a chewing gum". Now I'm interested what it really means lol
Well, Serbia has a chaotic history
The last time a big government collapse occured was when Slobodan Milošević was overthrown, after which a democratic coalition came to power
which then also collapsed due to the Kosovar independence crisis
They were voted out of power around 4 years after Kosovo declared independence, I wouldn't say that was the only reason they lost the election
In Serbia almost every young person knows English, but also a good amount of them German, since both are taught in schools (and they are mandatory), and how I heard from tourists they didn't had any problems with communication in English
I through that it's the same in every country, but I'm really wrong
For example in Romania, there was absolutely NOTHING written in English
Once we went to an ATM and we didn't understood a single word there because everything was written in Romanian and there was no option to choose another language
We asked some people to help, but no one knew English
In the end we went to a pharmacy to ask the worker to help and she thankfully knew English
It was very frustrating
Similar experience in Hungary
People who need to know English they do know it, for example managers and cashiers, but regular people rarely
I'm not saying we are the only non-English people who know English, I'm just retelling my experience
How I see from other answers, I believe it's just bad luck
Knowing English is a norm
We also learn the 3rd language, but it's not obligatory in every high school so people here know 2-3 languages (including the first language)
I like how Croatia understands design
It seems like it's a real part of the culture
Also Vojko V
Albanians are completely unified as a people no matter the religion
Truer words haven’t been spoken since the ‘90s.
Honestly true
Actually onions
Flair checks out
I was supposed to go to Uffizi on a school trip last year, but the gallery had some special event and we weren't able to enter even though we have paid for the tickets earlier
F them
Does it count if I spoke in another language so my parents couldn't hear me
We LOVE when someone is soeaking Serbian, even if the speaker knows only a few words
We would quickly then continue in English if we see that they are struggling, but would give them a chance
Some kind of soup + vegeta definitely
Oh and browned flour
Something with cabbage, minced meat (I'm aiming at sarma) and definitely some alcohol such as rakija or vinjak (brandy)
These days the smell would be smog due to pollution
balm for all the senses
In Serbia, we are losing around 50 000 people per year on a population of 6
9 million
You can really notice that when you go to villages
Some of the villages are completely empty and they look pretty creepy with all the empty houses and barns
9mil lad
Happy cake day
Legalized
It's unreal how backwards Europe is about weed compared to Americans (both North and South)
Thankfully we dont have that here
There is a unwritten law which in short says:,,Any one deemed a cannibal is automatically killed
"and thank god for that
legalize cannabis then make tobacco and alcohol illegal
It should be mandatory for high school, university and all workplaces
But siriusly, yes, it should be legalized
Why do you think this
I mean, I see you are saying it in spite of the fact that most of the sales of alcohol and tobacco are legal and taxed sales
So even though we have actual reality to show us that there are actual solutions that mostly work you want to not use the systems that work
When i was like 10 yo, i was convinced Portugal and The Netherlands are neighbor countries, and I absolutely have no idea why I thought that
Prague, Budapest, Belgrade, Dubrovnik, Palermo
On route, if going by car/bus/train you can stop in Vienna, Novi Sad, Zlatibor mountin, Sarajevo, Reggio Calabria
Barcelona, London, Venice or Rome, Athens, St Petersburg or Moscow
How much of a Brittish stereotype are you
Just curious
No, no one uses generational names
There is a difference between generations, but it's really not on anyone's minds that much
I think the generational conflict was much bigger 30,40+ years ago
Young people here don't think much differently than their parents, while my parent's generation had a huge problem with their parents about stuff like rock music, weed, parties, discos, dating, etc
It's honestly irritating to be bombarded by all this ''boomer, millennial, zoomer'' stuff recently, over internet
I think it went too far, and is in line with current trend in America to label certain social groups and then just pin bunch of stereotypical attributes to them
As if society is not already divided enough
Not really, only the label of 90s kid exists
i (and), a (conjunction for two actions that are not same or related), u (in), o (about), k (towards), s (with)
e and o also mean "hey" but it's up to you if those are the words
i (and), o (about), u (in), s (with)
Yes
"i" (and), "a" (but/while), "o" (about), "u" (in) are the ones I can think of now
There are also "s" (with) and "k" (/), but they are just shorter versions of "sa" and "ka".
And - i
Oh - o
Serb (Serbo-Croatian too)
U (in)
I (and)
O (about i guess i dont really know)
У(in), и(and), c(abbreviation of with, normally ca), a(abbreviation of but, normally али)
Same here, but switch *v* with *u*, *z* is *iz*, and *u* means *in*.
That myth is made by business owners so employees wouldn't find out that the owner is underpaying some of them
(Found this in r/youshouldknow)
How else am I supposed to know the horrible extent to which I'm being underpaid
Sfar as I'm aware, it's common with younger people who don't have very stable jobs, but with people who do it depends on what the conversation is and who they are talking to, so I think it is quite rarer
By far the green ones
I see red olives more often than the black ones
99% of the time
Even when they are 8 years old
I was 7 (1st grade) when I first went alone to school
It was like 5 minutes bus drive
Then we moved like 30 minutes bus drive away and I went with my parents during 2nd grade (8yo) but only because maybe I would lost myself in the city
After some time they've let me go alone
I'd consider my city (capital Belgrade) a very safe place to walk
I've walked countless times late at night from the other part of the city (like 1 am to 3 am walk) because I don't have a car
It is in my opinion way too cramped with information, they should have made more space between the lines or something
[Serbian one]
I like ours actually, its a cool design in my opinion
But our passports are way cooler with those like anthem lyrics noticable in the light
Exactly, but for ID I'd personally remove "valid until" dates to the backside so name and age, personal number etc
could stand out better
This is very hard to answer for a Serbian, as Serbia's borders and the Serbian cultural area changed all the time
Serbia, as a country, didn't exist in 1600, 1700 or 1800
Should I consider Neusatz (today Novi Sad) the largest city, even though it was a part of the Habsburg monarchy or Belgrade, even though it was a part of the Ottoman Empire
As I said, it's very hard to answer
1900: Belgrade
Beč in serbo-croatian
Tbf we stole that from Hungarian during Austro-Hungarian presence in Balkans, but nevertheless name stayed the same
Yeah, yeah that's it
Fascinated by the English language ever since we started learning it in primary school when I was like 7
Watched Disney cartoons in English, listened to British music, watched American series, read British and American literature
later, in high school, we also started writing tons of essays and letters in English and I've also been experimenting with story-writing in English, though honestly my stories aren't so good because I'm overall a bad writer with badly thought out ideas, not just in English
(or at least that's the opinion I have of myself)
Asides from the literature, music and TV, I also use social media almost exclusively in English and I talk to foreigners more than I talk to people from my own country, so I guess that helped a lot
Online games, more specifically MMOs and listening to others
The way I learned 99% English and the reason I can do an English test 100% intuitively is because of video games and youtube
Especially minecraft since I would put the game in english and try to guess what each item was
Intuitive grammar came from videogames,youtube and a little bit of it came from school(eg
How certain tenses are built; so basically I knew grammar but didnt know how it was built)
Started when I was about 5 in kindergarten, started speaking it "fluently" when I was 13, thanks to some kids from UK I was hanging out with
Sadly, my german never took the same route
I can usually differentiate people from Bosnia and sometimes from Croatia
It sounds ridiculous because we are the same ethnicities but there are subtle difference in the heigh and hair colors
The posture and the accent give it away also
There is a bit difference in our language
The Bosnian language is like old Serbo-Croatian with a some words that are specific to Bosnian language
Modern Serbian is different language
But still those languages are similar enough that we can understand each other
When you want to go to your next door neighbor, start up the car, make sure it works by bringing it to 4000RPM per minute for 10 seconds
After that go to your neighbor's house say hello to them, then bring back your car (test to see if it works again) and then enter the neighbor's house
Works for me every time
Izgubljen kao kuče u liftu - Lost (confused) like a dog in the elevator

100 kilos pig, 200 kilos grease - joke about people from my city, rest of Serbia says we lie a lot
We have Matica srpska originally founded in Hungary (outside of Serbia) but it's now located in Novi Sad (the 2nd biggest city in Serbia)
I've biked along Neringa last year, it's absolutely gorgeous
Also, nature aside, the villages on the spit are incredibly picturesque, especially Nida
No particular order, and no links, for I'm lazy and on the phone:
EKV, Idoli , Električni Orgazam, Bijelo Dugme (technicly bosnian, but its exYu, so it counts), Tap 011, Negative (band), Yu grupa, Smak
There is a lot, this is only my current playlist
The songs that every Serbian knows are the following:
Djudjevdan
Tamo Daleko
Vivovdan
Sini jarko sunce sa Kosova
Most popular singers that people have been listening to recently are the following:
Mc Stojan, Voyage, Breskvica, Coby, Rasta, Tanja Savic, Relja, Klinac
Most popular songs:
Mc Stojan - La Miami
Mile Kitic - Kilo dole Kilo gore
Rasta - Euforija, Kavali
THCF x Coby - Krvavi Balkan
Severina x  Ministrake - Uno Momento (Croatian/Serbian)
Serbian singers that have been in the game for a long time are the following:
Ceca - Beograd, Kukavica (2 of the many famous songs she has)
Dragana Mirkovic
Djani
Nedeljko Bajic- Snovi od Stakla
Seka Aleksic
Saban Saulic
That's a really good one, it has a shit ton of (pretty good) covers in other languages too, although, admittedly, none are as good as the original
[Here's the Serbian cover]
"For them" and reality
If he has the "Cyprus" flair I'm gonna bet Greek
Characters who speak American southern accent in original sometimes speak some kind of southern dialects or accents in Serbian, because they're often seen as rural or uneducated dialects
Oh hell yeah, people in the south don't even use padeži!
Serbian language is mainly divided to 3 dialects
Furthermore, every dialect group is divided by local accents (there are 9 sub-dialects in total, 6 of them in Serbia, and 3 spoken by Serbian people in Bosnia, Dalmatia and Slavonia)
I thought padeži are called cases
Jao izvini, moja greska
Mislio sam da si mi odgovorio na jedan drugi komentar gde pricam o glasovnim promenama, nisam pogledao

Čuvari prirode (guardians of nature) we had those classes in elementary school only and it's just like getting to know everything about nature, how to take care of it, and stuff like that
We have something similar but it's way less developed and more like
girls doing embroidery
It's elective subject (the other being technical and IT knowledge)
Belgrade has two major parts
City of Belgrade is located at the southeast side of Danube
New Belgrade is at the southwest side
The rest is suburban municipalities
We have Sremska Mitrovica and Mačvanska Mitrovica (Mačvanska Mitrovica is a part of municipality of Sremska Mitrovica, but it can be seen as a village or a small town)
They are divided by Sava (a river) and have a bridge in between
I’m afraid to mention Balkan wars lol
Literally every person has a different view on the Yugoslav wars
In middle school history class the teacher told us that if Serbia suffered a major loss in the 1389 Battle of Kosovo the European continent would have been overrun by the Ottomans at a much earlier age & with a greater force, probably ensuring permanent dominance of the Turks even today
Is it true
Have no idea
This isn't something that our books said, just teacher's POV but I bet not a lot of other countries have this event in the history book & probably don't see it like this anyway
In Serbia he's viewed positively as he's known to have given support to us during our revolution against the Ottomans
Verbal support that is
In Serbia when we learned about him we didn't necessarily say he was good nor bad
Though, we did learn he was a superior military commander, big IQ & very intelligent, etc
I listen to a podcast hosted by three Irishman called 80 days about various countries and territories around the world, and Irish regularly show up all over the globe
Actualy Napoleon was really harmful to our national liberation at the time
He supported the Ottoman Empire against Russia in the Russo-Turkish war
At that time, we were allied with the Russians in our fight against the Ottomans in the First Serbian Uprising
Serbian forces from Montenegro were fighting Napoleon's forces in in the Bay of Kotor instead of advancing against the Turks and linking up with forces from Serbia proper
Also when Napoleon invaded the Russian Empire, the Russians had to sign a peace with the Ottomans and leave us to our own faith
Thus the First Serbian Uprising was defeated in no small part because of Napoleon
Well try asking the land about its nationality
Yeah, Balkans
Actually we don't have beef with them
We know we came later but Vojvodina was barely inhabited and it was a frontier region so we kinda built everything here anyways
It doesn't. Iirc there was some controversy about it last year, but they ended up not joining
well Hungarians do have a longer history of Vojvodina inhabitance but it's not continual
During the Ottoman advance non-Serb population escaped, so the Hungarians from Vojvodina "only" trace their heritage to the late 18
century resettlement
....so Croatians
Yes, of course
Here in Balkans we upgraded
We have singers who built their careers on songs like that, their whole albums are offensive, and they are quite popular
There's a whole genre of music for offending Croats and Bosniaks and vice versa for them
Idk about others, but i listen to it when playing games with the boys
Isn't the guy banned like in half of Europe because of his ties with neo nazism lol
Crusader Kings 2: Havent played it much, I've played with Ireland, Castille and Francia
Europa Universalis 4: I've played with many countries, but mostly focused on Europe, I think I have the most games with Castille, the Ottomans and Austria
Victoria 2: Usually some great power or European secondary power, mostly France or Germany
Hearts of Iron 4: haven't played it much, only tried one game with Germany so far
CK3
I suck at it i so I go as a easy country like Sweden
EU4
I'm good at this one so I go as small countries often, sometimes I try Serbia I once managed to nearly reform the Roman empire as Serbia but then had some massive as coalition go against me that took everything except Constantinople and parts of Asia minor
It's also sometimes fun to play as a tiny German state but it is really hard
Victoria
I usually try Prussia or France but recently I've gotten a bit better at the game so i try Russia or the US
HOI4
I change it all the time mainly trying stupid weak countries (like Luxembourg)
I personally want to visit Beirut, Lebanon , Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Israel  or Istanbul, Turkey . But in theory the first one will be Dresden, Germany  visiting friends and family
I once saw an Oklahoma plate, and like 3 days ago I saw a Trump 2020 plate, but I don't think it is legal to drive with that thing lol
Saw a California plate on a massive vintage convertible in Belgrade, Serbia
Monkey [serbian - manki]
Not even our own translation of monkey (which would be majmun/мајмун), but a quite literal translation
I often heard people call it majmunče aka young/small monkey
We call it in Rs/BiH *Crazy A*  (Ludo a)
If Serbia is out or not in competition then any exYu, if not, then any European country or anybody against USA
Greece,Romania and maybe Russia
Usually Russia
Macedonia
That one's kinda weird lol
Same here, especially Ex-Yu countries but as well other Slavic nations
Hungary sometimes and Bulgaria
They indeed are
I mean they are not doing so badly when you look at the region
I think they are the only ex-Yu country with a positive population growth
This took a dark turn
I don't really think about them and when I do, I wonder why they haven't been just annexed by their neighbors
Just join us again so you won't be
Joking
Unless
>We are probably the smallest non-micro state in Europe
Montenegro is a lot smaller than you
I dont think it will escalate into ww3
But one thing is for sure, Iran and the USA will have a dick measuring contest that might get lots of people killed in the Middle East
And if does escalate, at least i have the comfort of knowing Serbia isnt bound by any deal to aid anyone
Imagine defending the US on these blatant war crimes and escalations
World's biggest aggressors
I think the Americans, known as the most gullible nation with most power in the world, are gonna eat this propaganda of Soleimani being a "terrorist" and that will cause a new instability in the region as soon Iranians return the favor of killing a high US representative
US is one of the worst countries in the world on many levels, it needs to be dealt with or this falling empire is gonna take the whole world down with it
Fuck Trump
Fuck US
Im glad the WW trilogy is coming to an end
We've been waiting for the third one long enough
Iranian companies will be bought by American businessmen and American businesses will start opening up in Iran, don't forget that
It would be nice for us to not have even  a cameo
Big countries are above the law
And people still wonder why europeans dont like americans
Nah
he was invited by Iraqi government
Stop spreading your bullshit around here you dumb burger
He ordered attack on US servicemen in the country bordering his, which they have no business being there in the first place
If that demonstration in front of the embassy is attack he organised, than he didn't know to organise one, because other than cosmetic damage to embassy, there was nothing else
Was this terrorist attack by US worth the dead that will come out of it as a response
I didnt mean that type of big
Iraqis protested, yeah there was tension, no one died
Do you remember why they protested in the first place
And what do you do after that, kill a top ranking general who probably didn't have anything to do with it and was invited by the Iraqi government
Hope Pompeo or any murican war criminal general dies next, after all they deserve it more than Quassem
R. I. P
>Or it would galvanize the population to become Uber patriotic and nationalistic
Europeans with flowers In their hair will understand this concept if/when that happens
Some Europeans have already experienced that, don't generalize that much
Maybe the US should retire every once in a while to think before it acts
I'm not
I'm sure that the man in that position deserves to burn in hell, if that place exists, but not to be sent in this maner
There will be other who will step in his place, but the action will not be forgoten
It could lead to another war with thousands of death and hundreds of thousands of lives destroyed for what
To show that US can drone strike you anywhere
Oh, you don't know us
We don't like anything that comes from the US government
We love Americans, tho
Go into the world stage and make actual changes and actions in the world and then you can talk about mistakes
Man, the whole of Europe's done so many things on the world stage, for better or worse, that it exhausted itself
What comes off as superiority is more of a warning due to lessons learned from European history itself
There would have been fewer problems in ME if western powers didn't meddle
The Europeans likewise caused or escalated certain conflicts that wouldn't have existed if they didn't act, but you won't hear people talk about them positively these days
Whatever happens, just don't take it too personally
Maybe the United States or Albania if things get heated
The USA/NATO
The whole western world
again
NATO could easily attack us because of Kosovo or Bosnia
* sad šajkača noises *
Ummm everybody around us, except maybe Hungary because we're currently bffs with Orban
Everyone
Just get everyone in there
Definetly the US, since Albania can hardly invade us alone
Ain't you currently being invaded by Bosnia
Nah we're pretty okay with you if you ask me
I just don't like your president that shows a lot of signs of hating Serbs, but I doubt Serbs would invade you
I was refering to the scenario if there was a war in Kosovo they would send people in
Although of course they wouldn't get far
I don't think any issues in the 90s. Besides of course you wouldn't because you're not as strong as you used to be
Stupid question, in Croatian Alps
Yes we do have better relations with them now, but if someone invaded us it would probably be them
Also, I agree that Romanians and Bulgarians wouldn't fight us, it would probably be Albanians
Yeah they would send people, but the question clearly mentions an invasion
They only trapped one Balkan country
I don't mean to sound like I'm provoking but Albania would likely have support from local Kosovars but in the end our military superiority would see it through
That is of course if it's alone but this is very unlikely or an invasion of any kind at all
Is Kosovo not our territory
Russia has recovered a lot since the 90s and China is a US competitor, both Serbian allies
If it was a war in Kosovo and he US actively helped like in the 90s likely NATO would win
I believe it would likely be the same just without the bombings
Yeah, "mlečni restoran" (milk restaurant), same principle
Here we have Russian kitchens
Like Mlecenzy bar,but Russian food
Idk why but I read Pizza Hut the first time,even though nearest pizza hut for me is in Moscow
In Serbian we call it "puškica" which is deminutive form of "puška"
Puška = gun/rifle
Similar to Hungarian we use "puškice" which are "tiny guns" :D
In Serbian we call it puškica which means a small gun
I still do not understand why we use it like that
Well, at least it seems that we ain't the only ones
Looks like Hungarians and Bulgarians use it as well
No but we definitely should
Kids backpacks are extremely heavy so it would be much better
Lockers were introduced to my primary school in Belgrade around 2013 and we were supposed to have two sets of books, one for school and one for home so our backpack is light
However kids tend to destroy lockers and since keys were so poorly made they were often broken, now they are still there but don't serve any purpose as far as I'm informed
There are rumors that Belgrade has massive undergrounds
Novi Sad has catacombs and tunnels built during the Austro-Hungarian era since it was a border city to the Ottomans in case of a siege or attack
There's a popular rumor that cults and the like meet there, claims justified by strange symbols and pentagrams seen by those who explore
Or it could just be bored teenagers, either way it's interesting
We have the biggest border dispute
The largest country by area fully in Europe
Most populous country and city in Europe too
50% - 32% - 16%
I mean yeah, but this is more unique
> And Russia started mobilising their forces several days ahead of Germany declaring war against both Russia and France
that's because Russia was already at war with A-H at that point
Ukraine and Moldova are not South Europe
OK you're right, Crimea is bigger than Kosovo (tbh I didn't know that)
But, no country recognizes Russian Crimea, while Kosovo is 50/50 so it's a bigger dispute that way
>As a diplomatic move, that had limited value since the Russians did not make this mobilisation public until 28 July
I'm not so sure about that anymore
At all time high, as far as education goes here, we started some of the most disgusting thing in our history, backed and designed by educated people
Today we have university on every street corner, degrees could be bought, curiculum for elementary and middle schools are archaic and burden to the students, who are left to learn on their own, if they want to know something other than basic stuff
Never seen anyone do it, not a thing here
No one ever says that here
In fact, we shouldn't talk with drivers at all, there are signs saying that
Mostly because you shouldn't disturb him while driving
Even if you want to buy a buss ticket you have to prepare the exact amount of money so that the driver doesn't bother counting the change
Absolutely not, it's very rare
Maybe if the bus driver was nice but usually they're douches and you don't even talk to them
Although we could start thanking god that we got off alive
They tend to be very rude
For instance when you give them a bigger bill they always complain or sometimes when they see you literally running towards the bus they go on purpose and they make a sarcastic shrug every time
I'm in France for several months and even in Savoie they thank the driver more often than not
I can't say I've been their fan for long or that I play too many games, but this was a pure disaster:
Mobile version of Diablo was released to appease the Chinese market because people go crazy for mobile games there
So, in addition to siding with Beijing, they destroyed the thing that made them stand out in the first place
It's a real shame, they spat on their audience and legacy
I'm always astonished by and angry at the greed companies display, and Blizzard perfectly displayed that
No one made them enter the Chinese market
No one made them sell out their company to shitty shareholders
Now when that bites them in the ass, they seek understanding and compassion from their customers who have nothing to do with that market
They could've successful enough to live a very comfortable life by sticking to just normal markets, instead, because of their greed, they've sunk to this depth of shame
Can't believe they went that far, it's extreme even for then
But honestly at the end of the day Blizzard is a business and China makes up a huge percent of their player base and income
Italy
Serbia, it's my own country but it has nice shape
croatia is eating bosnia
We have many ways to say that
Someone can "roar", "throw away the spoon" or "go to marble village". But my favourite is "hit the ground with your d***"
We also smell flowers from underneath
We just say that someone threw a spoon
(Bacio kašiku) (Бацио кашику)
I have never heard of it in Serbia, so it is probably unique for Slovenia
In fact, when you say that way death seems calm and peaceful, who wouldn't want to go whistle to crabs
I think our hospitality
We love when someone comes
We try our best to show you our country and culture in the best possible light
People here love to help each other
I mean the solidarity of random strangers is really strong
If you as a tourist come to us for directions, we'll try our best to help you
If you were to ride in our public transportation you would hear a lot of sorry's. The one bad thing is that we are one of Europes greatest smokers
However if you also smoke and are out of cigarettes, you can ask anyone on the street, and if they also smoke, they'll give it to you, sometimes even 2 or 3 so that you have for later
Isn't it "Hej Hej Monika"?
Kosovo
Its been rebeling and causing problems since the 80s
Kosovo and Metohija
KoSoVo
Apart from that, probably Novi Pazar (not a region but a city)
Lots of Muslims live there (not saying it's a bad thing, but different to the rest of the country) and it just feels kinda weird
Maybe the north part of Vojvodina, bc its full of Hungarians
Istria is truly beautiful imo
And its really nice that the airport in Pula airport has connections to Zagreb and Belgrade so its easy to get to
Also, you can go to Italy by boat
The Italians there make really good ice cream
It's just plain complicated and stuck in a stalemate
I see what you did there
A lot of them claim to be Italians, but are, lets say, a bit more southern
One of the things i didn't like in Istria, is how open their nationalism is being presented, and how many shop owners are most definitely not Croats, or from countries which Croatia borders
Its cool that i as a Serb can understand newspapers from Croatian minority in Austria that lives there for last 400,500 years
Baka Prase’s endtrack on Voyage
Baka prase and other youtubers
Absolutely hate turbofolk
Please, just ban that shit already
Blamage
That user likes Vesna Pešić
Balkans in general is drowning in reggaeton these days
That and mumble rap/trap or whatever it's called
I moved out this year to live with my girlfriend
I used to bring my girlfriend over and she'd usually stay longer than a week, sometimes a month or two and no one had problem with that
My family loves having her over for as long as possible
Now, I lived with my parents, grandparents and my brother
It's a pretty big 4 bedroom house so there's space
From my experience and what I heard people say, it's better to stay with your parents and not have to pay rent, plus in the future you'd inherit the house anyways
"Bože pravde"
It's mostly praying to God that he leads our country and people, but it's pretty nice song on my opinion
'Bože Pravde' means 'God of justice'
Ours is called "God of Justice" (Боже Правде/Bože Pravde)
I really like it, but it's not that special
Ehh, its not [bad] (shorter version), but i prefer this [one] over it
Melody stolen from Germany/Austria
0/10
Tamo Daleko would be much better
It kinda fits whole country, nice
U boj U boj is a masterpiece, but i don't think it really fits as an anthem tho
I think it's the same in Serbia
Granny Smith and golden delicious, and I don't know the names of the other ones
I live in Australia and literally every house has at least 2 barbeques
I live in Australia and nobody has it
The Serbian word for peanut is "kikiriki" and I always found that super cute
Yes, Voki toki, guess witch word is that
Although i am serbian, serbian is not my first language, so all words sound st least a bit childish to me because of all the č, ć, š sounds combined with k, d, p and other similar sounding letters
I thought all of us slavs had this feature
We can and will do this too, and I love it :) but we also have the opposite, suffixes for making things sound big in a kind of mean way
Janko is a legit common name here lol
What business have you with the Guards of the Crossing
Yeah, it sounds more lord of the rings than the actual job
I noticed that us Slavs tend to overuse the articles, or place them in wrong places
Oh yeah
Of course, i noticed that "the" shouldn't go there
We don't use articles at all, so that's why probably
I consider myself a good english speaker(lol), and i still struggle with articles
While i was in high school i wanted to learn Hungarian, but when i hear it or see it or anything i remember why i gave up without even trying
Honestly my reply was supposed to be sarcastic, it felt natural to put the there
Thanks for the tip fam
Well, it's useful if you want Hungarian passeport, but that's only for Vojvodina
As someone who lives in Eastern Serbia, i don't even know why i even thought about learning it
Imati seks - have sex
Also 'seksati se' - to sex, sexing, but that's not grammatically correct, more like a slang
Oh yes, we have a lot of types of sweets that are based on poppy
My grandma used to make them, and you can buy them in the nearest bakery too
[Makovnjaca] is the most common one, but there's also a kind of [small poppy cakes] or big ones, with different combination of chocolate, vanilla and other stuff with poppy
I don't think people really relate poppy to opium here
In Serbia we also eat poppy seeds, and they are espetially popular in the north of the country (the region which has a lot of indluence from central Europe)
I even ate poppy noodles in kindergarten
Now, concidering growing poppy, from what I'we heard, you need to register with the police if you are planning to grow it, and when harvest comes you have to surrender all poppy shells to them, to be disposed of
(Disclamer: I'm not a lawyer, this is only what I've heard)
And also, I don't think many people here know opium comes from poppy plant
>“polish heroine” called “kompot”
Well ofc I'll be called that
> I don't think people really relate poppy to opium here
like 50+ year old people do, poppy seed tea was popular to "put children to sleep" and farmer did used it to get high
Everybody should try a good makovnjaca, it kicks ass
I'm not sure if it's our local thing
I heard this story too
I wounder if it's actually true or just urban (or rurla) legend
It's Hungarian influence
Yes its true, in my fathers village one woman almost killed her doughter with that tea
Basacly she was asleep for 2/3 days
E) even police was some thimes checking if poppy plants where sliced (you slice them with razor and inhale it to get high)
I want a bowl of mak to eat with a spoon
Only "Black wave" kind if anti government movies in socialist Yougoslavia
>  films are known for their non-traditional approach to film making, their dark humor and their critical examination of the Yugoslav society at the time
>The film makers were linked by a common wish to increase the freedom of artistic expression, and to reform the cinematic language
The filmmakers wanted the right to show the darker side of the human psyche and to openly criticize the policy of the socialist state
This stream gained international attention as well as provoking strong controversies within Yugoslavia
Politically and artistically very important
movement
Yes, but it's not a game
It's called šatrovački and you just flip the word portions (not always syllables)
Similar to other languages, it's thought to have been created by criminals as a way to not be understood by the police
It's used extensively in hip hop
Pretty common in informal speech is to throw in a word or two from time to time, although nobody talks in full sentences
Some people's names in šatrovački become nicknames
Here's a joke about pretending to speak Hungarian for you OP:
*Mi daj šufla seleki
which is just: *Daj mi flašu kisele
("Give me a bottle of sparkling [water]
")*
[Here's] a song fully in šatrovački done by a Croatian band
[Here's] the original
&nbsp;
There's also utrovački where it goes:
*u + second part + za + first part + nje*
*malo ("a little") -> u****lo****za****ma****nje*
Utrovački is not well known
Kaladont, basically you say a word f.e. crvena (red) then the next player must take the last syllable, in this case "NA" and his word must start with that that syllable
You go until there is no word that starts with that syllable, or is ending with f.e. Senka (shadow), then next player says Kaladont, and it's game over for last player
Game goes untill there is only one player left (duh)
EDIT: and also there is this thing, it's not really a game, more like prison language, but is used sometimes as a game, basically u grab a word or name, f.e. Kola (car) u take last syllable, put it in front, in this case it would be laKo, then in front of now first syllable you put letter U, and in front of last syllable you put za, after last syllable you put Nje (ње), so in this case it would be Ulazakonje, it's called utrovachki, it's fun mind gymnastic, for me at least
Similarly we have "šatrovački" and it also reverse the order of syllables
Kuća - Ćaku
Brate - Tebra
This gets used extensively in Belgrade
I hear it everyday
And I have to say, it is a cool thing
Where in Croatia does it get used the most
And do Croats outside of Croatia (Posavina, Hercegovina, etc
) use it as well
Nice to know
Might come in handy next time I'm there
1918 King Alexander ditches the idea of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovene, instead kingdom of Serbia expands only into territories with majority / significant Serbian population
What remains of modern Croatia is ceded to the Italy along with Slovenia, which could probably be divided between Italy and Austria
If this had occurred, rise of fascism in Italy could be avoided, Yugoslavia and all its problems would never exist, Serbia would have to deal only with Macedonian separatist ( maybe partition of Macedonia with Bulgaria would solve that too) and you would have all Serbs living in the single state, opposed to what, 4(5)
Not creating Yugoslavia, instead take the Serbian majority territories as was offered during the war
That would change A LOT of things
The  outcome of the  XIV Congress of the League of communists of Yugoslavia
I wish the Slovenes didn’t leave, I wish the Croats didn’t leave the congress  and the party
The outcome would be that Yugoslavia would stick together and change some economic policies
It would exist still and the bloody ethnic genocidal war would be evaded
I'd like to make Serbia won the Battle of Marica, and it's not only for the sake of Serbia, but for central and Eastern Europe as well
When we lost that battle in XIV century, the Ottomans went through Bulgaria and created chaos in the Balkan states, and Serbia suffered the most
There definitely would be an escalation between us and AH
We had a trade war with them, and both countries in the early 10's were doing military exercises on the Drina border . With the collapse of the Ottomans, there was a huge power vacuum to fill in Balkans, and interests of Serbia and AH couldn't be any more different
What Albanian country
The Austria-Hungary created Albania out of the hidden tribes, in an effort to stop Slavic entry to the Adriatic sea
Saying the spam bots "Kosovo is Serbia" with your only argument of being the London conference is so absurd
Norway's foreign policy, energy policy and economy
Not beeing poor from Switzerland or Norway
Public transport from Switzerland
Other things are pretty good here
About Swiss public transport: Couple of years ago I went to Switzerland to see my uncle,aunt and younger brothers
We decided to go somewhere w public transport and they had these sci-fi looking train/busses which had screens in them,went a million km per hour and I basically couldn't hear them
In Austria I almolst got ran over by one because it went way too fast and were 100% quiet
We don't have motivation for anything, not to plant trees
Of course not
Rakija- people love it, but for me personally it tastes awful
Idk
It’s made of fruit, but i barely can taste it, only the alcohol
Rakija, most common is šljivovica
It's the elixir of youth and it tastes like happiness
Rakija- it tasts like alcohol with some fruit notes
Rakija, the taste depends of which fruit it is made out of
The most wide spread rakija here is šljivovica, plum brandy
sljivovica is a subtype of rakija
Chartreuse is fantastic
it's a group of fruit brandies
Plum rakija -> sljivovica
pear rakija -> kruska/kruskovaca
quince rakija -> dunjevaca
grape rakija -> loza/lozovaca
honey rakija -> mednica/medovaca
etc
etc
Nema na čemu :)
Not really, I kind of picked it up while I was a kid
I was 3 years old when I had a first opportunity to hear it on tv
After that, all the movies and cartoons I watched were on English
So as I grew up my knowledge of it was on the same level as my native language, Serbian
Keep in my mind my childhood was heavily influenced by English, from watching cartoons and movies, speaking to online friends who spoke English as their native language, to reading articles in English
Easiest language to learn considering most media is in that language
Hell no
English is so easy in my opinion, and if you use English on the internet then even the spelling becomes easy
English is super easy to learn, not because it's an easy language, but because of the internet, TV etc
You can learn it simply by watching youtube videos, TV shows, listening to music, playing video games
It's easy because you hear it a lot
I speak French too and it's a billion times harder to learn than English, imo
hit the lawyer, facebook up, delete the gym
Vienna - Beč
Thessaloniki - Solun
I can understand Vienna since it's called the same in hungarian, but why is Thessaloniki different, I don't know
I can assume it has some historical meaning ("so" means salt so for all I know, all salt in old Serbia was imported from one city) but I'm not 100% certain
For 1 RSD you can't really buy anything
For 10 RSD you can buy maybe a few pieces of gum
And for 100 RSD you can buy maybe a bag of chips or like 1-2 liters of drink depending on the brand
1 dinar can buy you maybe a small gum
10 dinars can buy you a small chocho bar ( bananica)
100 dinars can buy you burek or a sandwich
1 RSD - you can't really buy anything
10 RSD - 2 shitty bubble gums
100 RSD - 2 330ml cans of soda
1 dinar: literally nothing
10 dinar: a gum or two
100: some 80g of chocolate, chips, a few bananica etc
1 dinar - absolutely nothing, you get it more as change
10 dinars - two individually wrapped chewing gums
100 dinars - 1
5kg of apples OR a portion of pancakes to go OR a snack (chips for example) and a juice
Yea it do be like that
It's completely changed in Serbian
They translated FUN to "ZeZaNje" - having fun
And then you have
Ze je za zelenu algu na dnu mora (Ze is for the green algae on the sea floor)
Za je za zabavni žur (Za is for the fun party)
Nje je njegova originalna fora, dok pevamo na molu dur
(Nje is his original joke/gag, while we signs in Major scale on the pier)
Basically it's nonsense
I might have gotten something wrong, I don't watch Sponge Bob
Ze je za zelenu algu na dnu mora
Za je za zabavni žur
Nje je njegova originalna fora, dok pevamo na moru dur
Ze is for green algae on the sea floor
Za is for fun party
Nje is his original joke, while we sing major in the sea
F-Fenomenal times you spend with your friends
U-Excitement(Узбуђење)
N-Unforgetable fun(Незаборавна забава)
Yall are weirdoes
Wow samo su ostavili frend
It's fun nonsense though, and it really works in Serbian
SpongeBob is probably the only piece of media ever where I prefer the dub to original
I think the Serbian adaptation of the cartoon is absolutely spot on in all regards
"Ze je za zemljotres što sve ruši"
>(Ze is for the earthquake that destroys everything)
"Za je za zapaliti svet"
>(Za is for burning the world)
"Nje je za koernje sto se sada suši"
>(Nje is for the roots that are drying)
There's also word play in there, "na molu" can be "on the pier" or "instead of a minor scale"
First print, then cursive
For both Cyrillic and Latin
We first learn printed than cursive
I started learning printed letters in kindergarten and cursive in 1st or 2nd grade I think
First printed, then cursive
Then you can choose in which you want to write in
In first grade we learn printed-like letters, but in second grade we learn cursive letters
(In Serbia there are 8 grades)
First cursive then printed-like, but considering that my handwriting is awful you still wouldnt be able to read amything, also even though im 18 i still dont know how to write in cursive latin but can easily in cyrilic
Both, but teachers prefer cursive
And (at least in my school) nobody knows the cursive for Latin after 4th grade, and everyone freaks out when we have to write something in it
Wait, you don't learn printed-like in school
Just go directly to cursive
Oh yeah, essays in Serbian
"-Psst
Dude, how do you write capital L??"
"-I don't know, man, change the word order
Literally, and don't get me started with small k. Thank god after 6th grade we didn't have to write cursive latin again
You didn't? I had to use it all the way through secondary school
I didn't. In 7th grade our new teacher told us we write essays only in cyrillic cursive
Taxi
Literally exact same thing (taxi)
I opened the post to write the same comment when i saw yours
Air port taxi mafia, as we call them, are notorious, but they're not so harsh to locals, i think, only to foreigners or our people who live in the west and come to visit, and who forgot how things function here
So, notion to foreigners landing at Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade - call ''car-go'' service that is something like Serbian uber
If you really have to take a taxi, try going for ones that obviously belong to big companies (usually ''Pink Taxi''), because there are a lot of unlicenced free-lancers who are the worst scammers
Same, made that mistake once
The pizza is actually better in local bakearies
Same, it's important to stay in groups in Florence so they bother you less
Yeah basically, I figured it's not a staple in the north anyways
Had some great pizza in Florence and San Marino (even if it's not Italy)
There’s a (disputed) region that’s the subject of more than enough political memes that comes to mind
Lemme help ya with a couple more: West Serbia being the most primitive because it is too close to Bosnia, most of Sumadija being notoriously drunken to the boots 24/7, exception with Kragujevac which is the higher class than the rest of Sumadijas pesantry, us Esterneers being mostly Vlah people that throw magic on everything and TO THIS DAY live the same way they did 1000y ago, and oh god, people from Vojvodina speaking sloooooooow aaaaaaaaas fuuuuuuuck, so slow that when somebody from Vojvodina tries to ask somebody from south(where they speak fast like hell) how they are, southeneer has enough time to tell them abouth their whole history till this day before the guy from Vojvodina finishes their sentance
There are so much more memes, but these are the first ones that came to my mind
basically, we make fun of each other whenever we have a chance
Sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes
United in hating each other is still united
Excuse me lol
Nah, we got fucked over in Yugoslavia (not even counting the wars), everyone hates each other, especially in Bosnia where it's a three way struggle
Serbia wants to keep Kosovo and to gain Republika Srpska (Serb region of Bosnia) and possibly reunite with Montenegro
No, way too foreign and I don't like some of the laws and how it's organised
That's coming from someone from a not rich country
No, not really
Might have a higher living standard and all that, i have an aunt who lives (pretty well off) in LA, but it's not really for me
What they do to their workers, people in general with healthcare, the amount of crime,homelessness, racial tensions and all that i would prefer going somewhere else if i have to
Sure not all parts of the US are like that and im generalizing but still
I think that would be one of the tax havens of Europe rather than the US
Rich has nothing to do with it
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Countries are far far richer than most countries and i wouldn't move there in 2 lifetimes
You're allowed to have a family there, as opposed to
>and the US is quite friendly towards immigrants overall
Depends which part and which immigrants you're talking about
Fair enough although we have a sizeable diaspora in the UEA which isn't that bad
Me personally, I'd like to study or live there for a year to experience it but that's about it, the US that is
Same, going for a few months to a year would be cool, but staying for longer is a no for me
People do that more often than you think hah
I just can't stand them so i wouldn't even bother working there, maybe as a last resort
Oh, thanks for elaborating
I was thinking in a completely wrong direction, like political or ethnic issues
I'm a man and i know how my mother gave birth to me
Not all the details but most of the stuff
She said it was my duty to know so I can help my wife during and after the birth
It's common around here for women to talk about it, especially among themselves
And every grandmother has an advice or two how to handle the baby
I'd say it's common for women here to talk about it amongst themselves
My mother told me about hers (I'm a woman)
We call that "sarma" in Serbia
Croziflette for life
Montenegro: Crna Gora
Croatia: Hrvatska
Latvia: Letonija (not that different but eh)
Hungary: Mađarska
Germany: Nemačka
Germany:Nemačka
Hungary:Mađarska
I'm not counting slavic countries, since if I did, we would have different names for almost all of them
In norvegian helvete means hell
It sounds
hella cooler than Greece
Yeah, just Engleska
I would say a whole Kosovo cycle of our national poetry about famous battle of Kosovo
It isn't accurate in terms of history but it has a alot of simbols about freedom, heroics, faith and sanctity of these three
Its best encapsulated by these words: "Earthly is a small empire, while heavenly is for ever".
Well, not really a single poem/national epic
Tho we have 5 or so epic cycles of poems dealing with serbian history
However, we do have several patriotic songs I'd concider as "national poems":Vostani Serbije, Onamo 'Namo, Marš na Drinu, Boj na Mišatu, and Gorski Vijenac, tho this one is, let's say contravercial
Here in Balkan there is whole group of "pruve we are original inhabitants" historians
Have you been to the world cup in Russia
It is a big country with great stadiums and everything was organized great, it was 2018 for goodness sake, the cold war is long over
The US got it in 2026 at the same time I believe
Did they buy it too
My point is that Russia deserved to host the tournament and they hosted it amazingly, they have a lot of football fans and their league is always ranked either sixth or seventh in the rankings
Qatar is obviously a disgrace, but even if Russia bought it(which is possible, if not probable) I see no problem with that for the reasons I have already stated
I'm a bit drunk and haven't really had a chance to speak English in quite a while so my point might not be getting acroos, but what I meant is that Russia deserved to host it as much as England or Portugal and Spain for example
Are you sure you aren't just sad that you didn't get to host it
Saying "hand" when I really mean "arm". We have a word for both in Serbian, but we usually use "ruka" for the whole thing
Also saying "fingers" when I really mean "toes". No toes in Serbian, just hand fingers and foot fingers, lol
We say in Serbian: "Ја возим бициклу." Which exactly translated means: "I drive a bike
" But English correct is to be said Ride instead of drive so i get confused about those 2 things
Insulation and isolation
Serbian uses one word for both - izolacija
Probably Saint Sava in Serbia, he is Jesus Christ of Serbian history in terms of popularity and idolization
Sveti Sava
Saint Sava
Started the Serbian Orthodox Church, unified the kingdom
Was an heir to the throne but decided to become a priest instead
Yeah
Every classroom has the picture of him
We have a hymn dedicated to him that the children sing  in school on the Saint Sava day (27th january)
Also Dušan Silni (Dušan the Mighty) is idolized as the pinacle of what a fair, just and strong leader is
There’s a dispute on Vuk Karadžić legacyactually, whether he improved the language or massacred it
Me personallly I find the second point pretty stupid, but nevermind that wasn’t topic
Anyway he isn’t viewed as the saint on the same level as Saint Sava
If you are interested in this topic I recommend you the book ‘Za i protiv Vuka’ by Meša Selimović.
Yeah and built a hospital and few schools so the people can become literate
Yeah, but he actually did some important things in that period of time, while Saint Sava did nothing special except building a couple of monasteries (no disrespect to Sava, he is an important figure for a reason, but I think people idolize him way too much)
I was searching for this comment
Yay
What about the  king Franz Joseph
I see he is the brand there, like in Wien he is everywhere
Or is it just for the tourists
Yeah he simplified the writing so the people can learn to read more easily
Formidable job
Thank you Vuk Karadžić.
Not really, at least from my experience
It’s definetely a thing
But still not that much of people are preaching it, mostly vocal small groups
We do have some flat Earthers and I love laughing at their ingorance on Youtube comment sections
I’d say that the antivaxx crew is the most recognizable here of all anti-intellectuals
It’s a small number again but you indeed find them sometimes
We have other crippling problems than those movements(they don’t have a large presence)
Well
Hard to explain
Yes especially with Croatia for WW2
On a more positive note we have great relations with countries such as Greece and Russia because of WW1
you should avoid /r/askwomen as far as possible
It's full of sour people waiting to attack you for the littlest things
yeah, but sometimes when i read their perspective on things it hurts
i've been online since i can remember, but now the anglosphere is becoming very difficult for me, especially the us part
i find myself violently disagreeing with the premise of life - two party system, capitalist life is shit, and people run to reddit to defend musk and other poor millionaires
yes, this sounds a bit angry, but man we need some other perspective other than 'it's bad to pay taxes and build roads and have healthcare and basic decency'
edit: forgot to shoot my guns in the air
heeyyy 'i took my dog to his forever home' - this sounds like they are going to kill the dog
sure, they keep using it like it's a good thing, but i expect that written on a cemetary gate
yeah, this is the old question about who gets to be european
my langage is half turkish when you look at it - i keep being surprised when i realise some word is actually turkish
If you are good enough to be able to think in English, it sometimes feels like  there is a sub-personality that speaks for you
I think it might be because the way the sentences get to be formed is different then in your mother tongue, it is not exactly what and how you would have said it in your mother tongue, and the whole train of thoughts sort of ends up in a slightly different place
It builds up
I think that Bukovski mentioned something like this in some of his essays (I might be wrong here) and gave the example of forming a sentence where you refer to the white horse: in English, you would said "a WHITE horse - which doesn't leave much space for your mind to wonder
You know that it is white, even before you know that it is a horse
In French, you first found that you are dealing with something that is horse, and so on
I was thinking more on a subtitle differences in a meaning of words and phrases, their places and roles in the sentences
In Hungarian, I sound and feel really deep, formal and serious
In Serbian, it's just a bit higher pitched, more upbeat and fast - energetic somehow
In English, I oscillate between a typical posh valley girl and then slip up and slip into a *istern jurop aksent* occasionally
I become more toxic
Pollution
Thank you for coming to my ted talk
Davos was pretty cool, but holy fuck was it expensive
But its well connected to Zurich which is well connected to Belgrade so it worked out well for me
> Osijek: Definitely the most east-european looking and feeling city in the country
What
Hah, you guys are amateurs when it comes to eastern-europeanism
I zig-zagged through Slavonia (Osijek-Valpovo-Slatina-Orahovica-Našice-Đakovo) several months ago, and it barely touches the cornerstones of Eastern-European aesthetics
Where are your shitty facades, roadsides infested with weeds, roads infested with semi-patched holes, a single stray dog that somehow strayed from its pack of stray dogs
Everything got a facelift compared to what it looked like ten-fifteen years ago
It's a bit soulless, I admit, but it looks nice
On the other hand, turbo-folk lives on in Slavonia, though, and that's the wild card
Serbia is the closest to EU membership and is the only one viable
People say Montenegro because they're a chapter or few ahead but A) they're using the Euro unilaterally which is actually a big problem B) the most important part is that they've been ruled by the same person for 20 years
If Montenegro in this state becomes an EU member then I seriously wouldn't want Serbia to do so
Here's the thing, I don't see why Serbia would need to recognize Kosovo
The EU certainly can't demand this when it's own member states don't recognise it
The EU only requested normalisation in relations which is a viable thing
Kosovo would stay frozen as it is for the time being
You're also correct that it would be political suicide even to suggest such a thing
>What's the general opinion in serbia regarding EU vs kosovo
Most agree that the EU isn't worth losing Kosovo (or at least losing rights to Kosovo), it's too important to us culturally, historically and not to mention our people and cultural sights are in danger there so it's basically betrayal at that point
>Maybe i'm mistaken but i feel like older people are mostly against the EU since they still look at russia
Actually it's not like that at all
In most EU countries the older generations are right wing here it's basically 50/50 with older and younger people
Here's the general consensus, most would like to join the EU AND keep good relations with Russia
Russia is an important friend to Serbia, maybe more than the EU since they fiercely don't recognise Kosovo, losing such an important ally isn't in our interests
Obviously the Kosovo issue exists (honestly this really doesn't depend on us as the Albanian government isn't implementing anything from the Brussels agreement like the municipality of Serbian territories and is even putting up tarrifs) but there's also the issue of rule of law and various other things
As for Chinese investments, Serbia is in need of them and China is the only one willing to give which always comes at a price
Here's an informative [video] on the subject
I think the EU really needs to cut Serbia some slack, not just promises but something tangible, so Chinese investments will simmer down
>A) not an issue
Actually it's a huge issue
Montenegro needs to either get on the euro standard which it won't or drop the euro for it's own currency
>B) yes, its a problem
Big one at that, I don't see it getting resolved any time soon either since Milo Đukanović completely controls the government not to mention I think in 2010 he was named in the top 10 richest world leaders so he has ties with the mafia
That's not the only problem of course, Montenegro has a problem with the rule of law and new laws such as the government taking church property
>You have one big unresolved border
Normalisation of relations will not cut it
Not much can be expected of us in this matter since the EU itself can't demand recognition for membership
This is the only possible route
>Would be pretty stupid to have a union where a member is not recognized by other members of the union
I doubt you'll going to see it, if at all
Kosovo is dirt poor and sadly run by former terrorists (this isn't me being biased
KLA was designated as a terrorist organisation by even the US and it's chief members are the figureheads of the country) and criminals
The EU is aware of this
>Betrayal by who
Kosovo albanians
No I meant betraying our heritage and our remaining people there
While I agree that it would be smarter for our country to let it go at the same time we're a very proud people with a strong sense of nationality
Letting Kosovo go isn't on the table
>That's true but can it be done
Well that's the question now isn't it
Russia really has no stance on this, in fact I think they'd even like us to join because then they'd have an ally on the inside
A lot of Europeans here think we're some Russian puppet, truth is Russia has done much more for us than the EU ever has + as I said we're very proud and Russia has been our historical ally so we're not so keen on betrayal
If by chance we'd join the Union and benefits from that would start to show, I think people would be more appreciative of the EU and less Russian oriented but I still believe Serbs will always support Russians as a people
Right now we basically don't help out Russia at all, we haven't recongnised sovreingty over Crimea nor are we military aligned with them (or NATO) but we still consider each other best friends
Absolutely
Which is reason why all the bigger countries don't recognize it
All of them have similar situation
Agree
You made it waaaaay more simple than it actually is
It's a very complicated thing
It's like you didn't read my first reply
The same thing happened with Bulgarians and Slavs
I don't like either
If your surname is a little 'weird' and/or doesn't end in -ić, chances are you're from Vojvodina, the northern part of Serbia
Live in Australia
Have lived here for 10 years although I lived in Russia for 3 and Austria for 2 earlier
Unless we can somehow pull ourselves out of the economic and political shit hole we are in right now, I don't plan on moving back, however I do visit regularly

There's this video for example that shows everything quite good
Other than that there's touristic Channels that post videos about many stuff
I don't know anything about you but if you've been in a relationship for 10 years with that person it means they are probably worth keeping
Or not, but you need to look into that more than moving back
No country or people are more important than the ones you love
Just my 2 cents
Edit: Yeah **disregard** everything I said there
From UK to Latvia, 30 yearolds with a dead bedroom
Mostly because of the dead bedroom issue, that's a sign she doesn't love you anymore
Sorry mate, you deserve better
> Sadly I think most finns find it easier to become friends with someone who speaks finnish
that's every country ever

Ok some may, but they're rare
We had some great ones - but we also had some serious failures
But the worst for me is “Cipela” (“shoe”) where the guy sings about his shoe going round the world
[Cipela]
For a trash contest - this would be a fine choice, but I do have higher standards and expectations for Eurosong
(And yeah, Croatians having a “Heel” and us having a “Shoe” as our worst choices - just speaks how similar we are, even when making trash music )
I think this is solely for Britain and some of it's former colonies
I live in Australia and it is done here, but not in Serbia
Not the red poppy, but we wear Natalie's ramonda,  which is an endemic species in Serbia and N. Macedonia
The flower is known for being able to be revived by watering it when it becomes completely dry, therefore having a nickname "phoenix flower". That trait symbolises the Serbian Army in WW1 perfectly
We wear a badge on a black-green ribbon around 11th November
We have Natalie's Ramonda
You just spent WW1 selling explosives and cocaine to both side
Yeah, we use them but not poppies
From neutral perspective, Austrians feel much more hot headed and much more proud about their nation, heritage history etc
and overall Austrians are closest Germanic group of peoples to Serbs and other west south Slavs, which is no coincidence considering that a lot of Austrians/Germans lived in these areas and some parts of Serbia were part  Austria for centuries
I didn't know i had an inner Austrian in me
We call it Češka which is basically Czechia
The long name basic conversation is unneeded but honestly I like the way it sounds
In my country we call them "Češka" since forever, and that name is more similar to Czechia than to Czech republic, so I don't really mind the difference
Also, if you watch Eurovision, you'll notice that only they have the word "republic" in their name and it kinda sticks out
We say Češka and it sounds ok, but in english it’s terrible
> češkko
Thats how you say czech in well czech
in serbia we saz Češka (way better then cuechia)
The revolutionary Serbia [boar flag]
[I like our flag from first Serbian uprising]
[Also medieval Serbian kingdom had a nice flag as well]
The 19th/20th century Kingodm of Serbia flag
Either [this one] or the present-day flag
[Kingdom of Serbia (pre WW1 Serbia)] Just looks the best in my opinion
still, it has 2x more details than today's flags
In serbian
Jealosy = Ljubomora (could rougly translate to Love nightmare)
~~Envy = zavistan  it means addicted (like in seanse addicted about what people think that you dont have same things like other persone)~~
I am idiot zavidan is envy
Ljubomora - jealousy
Zavist - envy
They are not used interchangeably
Interesting, because *revnost* here means "zeal, enthusiasm".
>Envy = zavistan it means addicted
Zavistan/zavidan mean envious
Zavisan (without the t) means addicted or dependent
These two words are unrelated
/u/onlyhere4laffs, to answer the second part of your question:
Yeah, jealous gets used instead of envious (not the other way round, though) like in English
sory my brain just trurned of and i mixed up that 2 words
Well there are three countries that share a similar language to ours, many says those are the dialects of the same language
If you take into a consideration all the variations of these three languages, there are a lot of dialects
3 dialects
"Štokavian", "kajkavian" and "čakavian". The difference between them is the way people say the word "what". Basically "what is this" can be said as "šta je ovo", "kaj je ovo" or "ča je ovo". Kajkavian and čakavian are only present in Croatia
Štokavian is then devided in 3 dialects "rkavian" "ikavian" and "ijekavian". Basically how one would pronounce the old letter "yat". So milk would be mleko, mliko and mlijeko respectively
And now all the other dialects are inside these 3 groups
For example, "prizrensko-timočki", "slavonski ekavski", "kosovsko-resavski" and "šumadijsko-vojvođanski" all belog inside ekavian
The difference between kosovsko-resavski and šumadijsko-vojvođanski is that kr would use less grammatical cases and would have stronger ekavian accent (šv: zdraviji, kr: zdravej, translation: healthier, notice e instead of i)
Also the voice "h" does not exist (šv: hleb, kr: leb, translation: bread)
On the other hand šv has system of 4 different accents
So the word could have long rising accent (gláva), long falling (sûnce), short rising (vòda), or short falling (pesma), plus just long accent that only occurs after the base 4 accents (jùnāk)
"Zetsko-južnosandžački" and "istočno-hercegovački" belong inside ijekavian, while "posavski", "young ikavian" and "Istarski ikavian" belong inside ikavian dialect
Official Serbian language is made upon šumadijsko-vojvođanski and istočno-hercegovački
However other dialects are not any less important or "correct" and are still used in parts of Serbia
Europe is not a country so every country inside Europe has it's own "capitals". However, having a look at the Europe as a whole we can find certain capitals of something
For example Paris is a big fashion capital for France, however I'd say Milan is The Capital for European fashion
Similarly we can find a lot of car industries across Europe
Italy and France have their own capitals, but I'd say Germany is a definite Capital of automotive industry
Yet if you live in one country in EU, you can easily work and live in another
So say you're a fashion designer, you can choose between a lot of cities like Milan, Paris or London
Let's see
Serbian, Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Turkish, Russian, German, English, French, Spanish, Italian
So 11 I guess
> Croatian (and Serbian
Then also Slovenian, Bosnian, Montenegrin
and a few others lol
I think you of course count four countries
But I would count 1( serbo-croatian) or two Serbian and Croatian language but I think it is more appropriate to wait for answer from Bosnians and Montenegrins ( did I wrote that one right idk)
Question for croatians:
Do you really in your languages learn it together "hvala lijepa", I mean we to say "hvala lepo" but if somebody would ask me how to say Thank you I would just say "hvala". Lijepa/Lepo means nice(ly) or beautiful(ly)
And from Vranje till Greek border is fala or blagodaram

We barely have trains, not some fancy zone in it
All of our trains are completely silent because most of them are not functional or, if they are, they cannot go faster than 50 km/h, so you really do not need a quiet coach
No,there are refuqees everywgere
We have trains but they barely move

Marks Square in Venice is breathtaking
Being there after seeing it in history books is an experience in it's own
We went to Venice in highschool too
At that time I was crazy about Corto Maltese in Venice graphic novel, and the city felt like a dream, despite the hoards of tourists
"single day field trip"?
Couldn't even get into Saint Mark's Campanile (the tower) due to the huge amount of Chinese tourists
Granted we did go in spring when it was tourist season
But as you said despite that the city felt like a dream
Yes in Venice, 5 day long in Italy

Well, mostly I am Serbian, but I've got ancestors from Croatia (great-grandmother), and from Bulgaria (great-grandfather)
I don't really speak about this too much, given the fact that these three countries fought a lot in the 20th century
Personally, I am against labels, and I judge a person by the weight of their character, not ethnicity or race, however, there are many people here in Balkans who are the opposite
I speak both Serbian and Croatian, i mean, they are dialects of the same language (Montenegrin and Bosnian is also here in the mix, according to the linguists), and my Bulgarian is bad, but I am practicing it because I have applied for Bulgarian citizenship
If only Mrnjavčević brothers and their armies hadn't been wasted on the eve of the battle of Maritza with the Ottoman Turks, and subsequently slaughtered in their sleep, we could bought ourselves and the rest of the Balkans at least a few decades of freedom, and who knows what would happened next
So there is this one guy
He was returning home from really bad day at eork, and decided to stop and get something to eat
As he is eating and thinking about his day, suddenly the car turns the corner; it's austrian arch Duke
The rest is history
Honestly, that was either greatest coincidence in history or some highter power at work
Night before the battle of Maritza, Serbian army had a feast, got drunk and fell asleep
During the night, ~800 Ottomans sneaked into the camp and slaughtered ~70
000 Serbian soldiers, including our king Vukašin
If this didn’t happen, Serbian army would easily won the battle and would kick Ottomans from the Europe, preventing their campaign in the Middle ages
That wouldn't have saved the Balkans from the Turks
Without a central government to rule over the Serbian states, they were destined to be disunited
This is exactly what the Ottomans exploited in our timeline
A single show of unity wouldn't have given the Balkans enough time to significantly change in a way that would stop the Turks
We used to say *Belgrad* but now we say *Beograd* bcs L for some reason shifted to O. Foreigners however kept this old spelling and name and I honestly prefer it, it sounds better to me
Beograd - White city
Novi Sad - New now
Subotica - Little Saturday
Soko banja - Eagle resort
Sombor - Catfish Pine tree
Wow Irish sounds like what Elves speak in the witcher universe

The waitress told us herself that if we can't finish our food, we can ask her and she will wrap it up for us
Based on what I noticed, adults had no trouble finishing their food but kids did and the parents would wrap up their kid's food and take it home with them

> Bigger amount of vegetarians and vegans, also from a young age
well i mean, you did say they love their fries
> Even night clubs had these insane queues where you sometimes had to wait between 15-90 (!) minutes to get in
lolwhat, why don't they go to a different club
In the Balkans hospitality is very important, it's expected of the host to take care of the food and the drinks, so yeah probably a cultural thing
then there's something seriously wrong with nightlife there
Here if there's excess of people wanting to go clubbing, more clubs will open
Never seen lines in front of clubs lasting for longer than 3 minutes here

Vučić?
I wouod vote for the one  one that created four wars, three with our closest neighbors and one with f**ing NATO
All that in ten years
Lol, true :)
Thou I would vote for the one that created four wars three with our closest neighbors and one with f**ing NATO
that one is pretty bad
Yes
First one was actually Milos, he killed most of the opposition voivode, rather silently tho
Milosevic outright murdered his most known critic, Stambolic
Stambolic's murder was creepy as shit
Imagine being put in a meat processing machine
That wasnt Stambolic, Stambolic was killed and buried
There is something I have to ask - considered weird by who
(Whom
) I'm not sure that real grown up people living in reality would judge another person for *eating*. It even makes more sense that you won't cook for yourself, so you would go out to eat
The question is weird for me, since you would be eating at a restaurant, which is the normal thing to do in a very literal sense
You aren't fixing your car in the restaurant, that would be weird, right
If you find yourself asking this kind of question you should move somewhere civilized
Yeah, I wouldn't think a second about it
Nobody cares at all
Bounty hunters are illegal pretty much everywhere except in America
Came for this comment
Anne-Marie, two names or a middle name isn't a thing in Serbia
~~Tmi, my dad and brother are both Lászlós, actually
&#x200B;
And my goodness, do I simply love old stereotypical High Germanic sounding names like Ulrika, Hildegard, Astrid, Sigismund, Valdemar, Wilhelmine, Brunhilde - spliced in with the occasional Latin ones like Ursula, Glorianna, Octavia, Beatrix and so on and so forth
Don't even care if they sound pretentious or wildly outdated
I just adore them for their old-timey poshness
But, if I had to chose just one, I'd definitely go with Libushe for sure, the mythical founder and first queen of Prague, since I'm partially Czech myself
It's just so close to my heart
Luckily, my family has a tradition of interesting names, so, it wouldn't be entirely far-fetched for us when you think about it
Would probably cause quite a few raised eyebrows where I'm from, though
So, feelings are conflicted
I have a friend from mixed German-Serbian-Hungarian-Slovak background
He has hungarian name, his sister has German and his brother Slavic name
Just another regular family in my region
pretty sure there is "Ana Marija"
Stalin's brother in law, Alexander Svanidze (Александр Сванидзе) ? He was Georgian though
If there is I've never met anyone with it, glad to be wrong if true though
Serbians and Croatians have different names mostly, I'm not surprised it's a thing in Croatia although some here say it's a thing in Serbia too although I've never heard of anyone with that name
I'm aware, I first found out about it through a Portuguese girl
I think it sounds really nice
I don't think that's considered a middle name in the same sense as in some western countries, hence why I didn't mention it
Aljoša is a name in Serbian though for instance
We also have Aleksa which is also a male name but might not be perceived as such anymore (thx Amazon)
Neither of them are nicknames for Aleksandar
I personally hate clothes with logos because I find them lazy style and hella stupid
It's just a way to show off you got money which I find superficial
I avoid them like the plague lol
I've noticed that those who wear clothes with logos are those who try to imitate the current american hip hop style in which the dudes try to flex their money
These people are not what i'd call well-dressed
They look ridiculous most of the times and they aren't taken seriously by the general population anyway
France
I used to romanticize France, learn french, watch french movies and listen to french music
until I visited Paris
Don't get me wrong
It was a pretty city but what I saw and experienced was far from what I've seen in the movies and various photos and posts
First of all, it was very dirty, less impressive than I thought it would be and way too dangerous for me to enjoy my trip there
My  balkan country is far safer to walk around at night than Paris
Not going back anytime soon
Im pretty sure its the norm in most of Europe
Yeah
I don't think I've encountered a shared washing machine in my life
I think there might be shared machines in student dorms or something, since it doesn't make sense to have 1 machine per person
Serbian- originally it was your father's name then Vic on the end, when this stopped you kept the last name as your father so if you were the child of the first generation after it stopped it would be your grandfather's name then Vic, next generation your great grandfathers and its continued like that until now
>Serbian -ović
Doesn't necessarily have to have an O. For example  a common surname is  Milošević (I know there was one major famous idiot with it as a last name)
arent thous more serbian
Also, it doesn't have to have -ić at all
Serbian last names in Vojvodina (northern Serbia) often end with -ev, -ov, -ski, -in
Well, those are all common Slavic possessive suffixes, so it figures that you have them in many surnames from Slavic countries
I mean, you have them in Russia or Ukraine too, they're all over
(Edit: koliko znam, takve nastavke imaju samo Srbi iz Vojvodine
Naravno, u Vojvodini imaš i drugih naroda sa prezimenima sa takvim završecima, ali Makedonaca def ne baš mnogo)
Well i don't really mind i don't need English to understand Croats and Bosnians maybe Macedonians but for everyone else English is a good neutral language with which we can all communicate, plus i like English language, it's one  beautiful bastard tongue which makes it perfect to be our universal language
Yes a bit because it is so so so complicated and has no rules at all
I had similar problem
When I was in Prague few months ago, people woučd automatically switch to English
It came to the point where I had to tell one girl: "why are you sabotaging my efforts to learn your language
I think my Czech improved after that
Am I the only one who thinks the opposite
Native English speakers will have a harder time learning another language than someone else learning English
poljsko ó je bliže češkom ů, oba se čitaju /u:/ a nastala su od /o:/

Hungary - nah, we're cool
We had a lot of historical beef, but now we are good
Romania - tbf probably our best neighbour
We aren't culturally as similar as other EX-YU countries (obviously), but we didn't have any conflicts historically and I don't think we will in the near future
Bulgaria - Same as Hungary, just maybe a little bit closer culturally
North Macedonia - country that we are mostly cool with from EX-YU ones (along with Slovenia) and they have their own stuff going with Albania and Bulgaria
Albania - Well obviously we have a lot of disputes with albanians (mostly Kosovo ones), but as a country I don't think they intend to fight us, neither do we (unless some crazy sh*t happens on Kosovo)
Montenegro - People of the two are very close and hostile towards each other (mostly), but our goverments are not in good shapes lately and montenegrin politicians intend to make their own orthodox church, which is obviously not a good sign for our people there
However, in the near future I think our goverments will match each other as well as people do (also depends on which person do people elect as a president)
Bosnia and Herzegovina - This is the one I'm most worried about
We quite recentelly fought during the breakup of Yugoslavia (which is multicultural federation in most of it's existence) and today's Bosnia and Herzegovina is very similar to that model, consisting of three constituous groups that (almost) hate each other
Some things will happen there for sure, but I can't predict whether it will be a war or just a smaller conflict
Croatia - We can't admit we are very similar to each other and that's our main problem
After the war, Croatia clearly "said" that they don't want to do anything with us in the future, we did the same and we just kept the distance since then
I don't think there will be a war between us as long as we aren't being too close, because Yugoslavia proved that that's not possible (as of now)
So, yeah, BiH is a site with the highest risk of war happening (not counting Kosovo), followed by Albania and Croatia
I can't imagine us fighting with others
Good to know that we aren't the only ones
If war ever breaks out in the balkans again it will be because Serbia is never satisfied with what it has
Our tendencies toward Serb Republic in Bosnia aren't even a secret
Yeah, unfortunately I never visited Bucharest, but I imagine the two are very similar
I heard people call Bucharest "a little Paris", which probably means arhitecturally is very stylish
It is very high on my wishlist
However, I've been to Timisoara and it is very similar to most of big cities in Vojvodina (f.e. Novi Sad)
I think this "status qvo" will remain for a while simply because both of the sides won't give up on the land
According to my country's law it is
I think there is a bigger chance of civil war happening in BiH than international one, but as for Kosovo it could be very bloody and probably all big players would "pick sides" (f.e. US would probably support Kosovo and Russia would support Serbia)
There will be minor conflicts for sure, but I don't think  major things will happen
It is of great importance for both serbs (historically) and albanians (politically), but I think enough sh*t happened in the last 30 years and both of the sides aren't keen on battling anymore (atleast not as a war)
There are like 30 or so languages spoken in the north of Serbia, 3 of them (Hungarian, Slovak and Ruthenian) are cooficial with Serbian
Other than Serbian, I speak Hungarian pretty much fluently
The northern province of Serbia, Vojvodina is really diverse with 6 official languages (Serbian, Croatian, Hungarian, Slovakian, Romanian and Rusyn)
The last one being a really interesting case, since Rusyn, not to be confused with Russian, is only spoken in Vojvodina and a few municipalities across the border
Being from the northern part of Serbia (Vojvodina), can confirm I can swear in Hungarian, Slovak and Ruthenian, as well as in Serbian
The only way we'll get Kosovo back is if all Albanians decide to move
That being said that doesn't mean we shouldn't stop fighting to preserve our cultural heritage and rights for our people there
First half of 18th century would be an interesting thing to see
At that time we had a lot of uprises against the Ottoman empire, and people were wearing some cool outfits if you ask me
No, it’s New Year’s tradition
Christmas tradition is Нож
Is there a traditional Christmas/New Year movie then
Ironiya sudby maybe
Dizelaši - during the 90s though
Klošar is nowadays a popular term for people who are trashy and chav-ish
We have klošare
Usually similar to gopniks they are poorly dressed very rude people
[Dizelaši] \- in fact, their streetwise, urbane aesthetic became so prominent all throughout the 90s that to this very day a lot of men here, conciously or not, still prefer the short-to-bald buzzcut hairstyle and the sportsy-dressing look
Eh for a redneck type of thing a seljačina would be a better equivalent , and we also do have džibere as well
Sometimes but the urban meaning is usually very similar to gopnik
Yeah, this is fucking weird stuff
I met a kid once, son of some uni profesor from Zagreb, and the kid recited some of this stuff to me here in Belgrade
I felt sad
Yeah, I see a lot of that now here in kids who are maybe 16-20 years old, and I hope the young young kids somehow avoid the generation of shit and idiocy
I know :( I guess for them it will be more of the same plus this resurgence of show-off religious crap
Here you can see people who notice a church, or a part of a church, or a pixel, and they cross themselves
I was stunned when I saw this the first time, but now it's almost normal
Insane people
Croatian: Almost 100%, maybe there's a small chance I won't understand a word, but probably not, it's like a British person speaking to an American
Macedonian: around 50-56%? If I really focus, I can even hold a conversation
Slovene: about 30-40%, I can understand basic sentences, but in general, not intelligible
Polish: 30% at best, it's much different from Serbian with all those long words that sound pretty hard to say
Czech, Slovak: 35-40%, sounds like Serbian, but simplified to the level I cannot understand it anymore
Bulgarian: 20-35%, people speak very fast so it's hard to understand but I could understand if they spoke with very basic words and sentences
Russian: 20-32%, same as Bulgarian, some of the words straight up sound like Serbian words but shortened and said fast, probably couldnt hold a conversation
Ukrainan: 10-15%, sounds like a harder version of Russian, it's kinda strong and fast, it sounds like a mix between Polish and Russian
*Croatian Bosnian Montenegrin*
Why are these even distinct languages
The same thing as Serbian,but with 10-30 different words and same letters
*Check,Slovakian*
Not too much,but some words yes
Different spelling and words make it difficult
*Russian*
Pretty much yes,but There are some words that sound unlike anything I've ever heard before
*Slovenian*
I know Austrian and Serbian,so Slovenian is pretty easy
*N.Macedonian(sorry)*
Here and there
Some words are same as Serbian, familiar currency (Dinar and Denar),but some words are more like Bulgarian
*Bulgarian*
In a word:No
In a sentence:Very few familiar words,so its kinda hard
*Ukrainian,Belorussian*
Almolst the same applies as with Russian
(Not counting Croatian and Bosnian)
I'll make a little ranking:
Macedonian
Slovenian
Bulgarian
Russian
Other Slavic languages, except Polish
Polish
Generally Slavic languages are pretty similar; most of the time, if you both try hard enough, 2 Slavs can hold a conversation in their languages
I can completely understand Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin
Of course, there might be some words I wouldn't understand due to a regional/country dialect
I would definitely be able to hold a conversation comfortably
Though, I can't say the same for Slovenian, Bulgarian and Macedonian
However, if they speak slowly, I might be able to understand around 60 or 70%. I'd really have to make an effort to speak those languages
When it comes to Polish, Slovak, Czech and Russian, I can understand certain words and simple phrases but I wouldn't be able to converse
I can understand all South Slavic languages like they're my native language
Other slavic languages, not so well
Same except I understand Polish because of my Polish mum
When it comes to Slovak, last Summer I was on a cruise and there were two Slovak tourists with their guide telling them about the sights
I understood everything without knowing the words, it was a really strange experience
Pa ovo prvo jer je isti jezik nznzm sto izdvajao, pa desi se da ne razumes neku rec kad ti prica neko iz sandzaka ako si sa severa
We use it the same way here
Shtokavian/ neo Shtokavian would be really legitimate name since its neutral
a i to sto kazes
Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin are all the same language (usually reffered to as Serbo-Croatian), just different dialects
I didn't write Montenegrin because not even most people in Montenegro claim to speak it
mass genocide
Black Hand Assassination Hit Squad
My school had a Hungarian class (I'm from Vojvodina) and Serbian classes
It worked well, they just had class in their own language and that's about it
Although sometimes I worry about how well some rural Hungarians who come to my city will speak Serbian because of that reason
I believe there are also schools which have classes in Slovak/Rusyn/Romanian etc
and in the south classes in Albanian
I don’t want to talk about it
Do i need to answer that
No, no
*Pretends to ignore Kosovo*
We had Kosovo, and they had their way and are independent
I'm not really sure that they are better like that but that's a closed chapter
Also you can hear some rumblings about Vojvodina independence or joining Hungary, but those are mostly ignored
There is no really serious independence movement
Well
now that you mention it
Do I actually need to write anything,or does everyone already know
Again
Thw word for handgun is "Pištolj" and the word for revolver is well "revolver"
And another example car is "auto"
North Pole or South Pole and Gender - Пол, Pol
We also use same word for Shotgun and gun -
Puška, пушка
Same here
Playing video games, tinkering with broken electronics, watching cartoons and TV shows, building LEGO structures, playing basketball
I still do all those things now, only I'm taller than I was when I started
Numismatistical, ventriliquistish, Ghastists
That's all that comes to mind
We're landlocked but I also have to go with Portugal
The people seem to have similar sensibilities and the cities, but mostly small towns, feel strangely familiar
Inland it's even more similar, it's almost uncanny
I love the place honestly
Also, Ante [Pavelić] was hiding there for a long time and also buried there
Wow, interesting
I never noticed how similar they sound but yeah, you're completely right, it's almost uncanny
> In 1996, he was photographed posing at the grave of former Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić in Madrid
Ustaše had sought the advancement of an ethnically “pure” Croatia, collaborating with the Nazis in the persecution and killing of minority ethnic groups
Šuker’s response to the photos, as reported in The Guardian, was telling
“It is well known what Davor Šuker stands for,” he said, referring to himself in third person, as he often does
> Šuker’s support of the defender Josip Simunić has also generated outrage
The former Croatia international, who helped fund a 2016 film alleging that the Croatian holocaust was exaggerated, was banned for 10 games in 2013 after engaging in nationalistic chanting after a World-Cup playoff game against Iceland
Šuker, who by then had been elected as chief of the country’s footballing federation, saw fit to appoint him as a coach for the national team
Yikes
We used webex cause the email invitation is rather simple to use
None, I don't have it mostly
And when I do, I just skip it
But it's Zoom
Besna Kobila (mountain) = angry mare
Srpska Crnja (town) = Serbian black (person, but could also be interpreted as
Babin Zub (mountain) = grandma's tooth
Srpska Crnja (Српска Црња) - means Serbian ni*ga
That one was so bad it's almost cheating
In our country religion is still a big part of our lives
So I can easily say that we don't become religious all of a sudden
We are religous through out whole life
It's not uncommon to see people fasten for 40 days before Christmas, or every Wednesday and Friday
They don't have a reaction, never heard of Serbia
... They don't say anything out of politeness plus they don't know of it much
Great of course
You mean Siberia/Syria
I would tell them no Serbia and then the blank stare would come
Belgrade, no snow yet
I think this is the first winter since measurments began without snow
We did have snow fall, but everything would melt instantly so it was basically like rain
In Belgrade we had snow for a day but it melted instantly when touching the ground
Each year there is less snow, but this is the first time I've ever seen a winter with no snow at all
In yyeeaarrss not a single snow flake
I live in northern Serbia(Novi Sad,Vojvodina)
In Southern Serbia,Zlatibor is covered in snow 24/7
French and Greek
Polish is a really sexy language in my view, and imagining how its written makes me feel even better (don't know if many others would agree considering how fucked up the orthography and how hard the language itself is), but yeah, I actually love that
I might have a bias though since I'm Slavic
French and Italian
I also like Spanish and Portuguese
I'm not sure about that but I know that we Serbs take pride in having domestic monarchies ruling over us during the period where having germanic monarchy was  the trend in Europe
I really want to believe they're not still sore over that war
Well 6th is cristams eve so yes, but not for same raasone as you
Well it is Christmas Eve in Serbia, so yes we do celebrate
For christsamas eve you fast, you have few types of fasting, most people do "easyest" witch just forbide you eating animal products (but you can eat fish and honey)
But there is also, fasting "on wather" you eat only what can be pepaird in wather (so just boiling food and no frying), And think some monks dont eat anything other then bread and wather
Well also burn oak branches (old pagan tradition)
on Christams day we make special food [česnica] you put gold coin (well today just regular one) and who gets it in his slice he will have forntune that year
And there are alot more traditions but they are more limited to some parts of serbia, so not all people do them
Talk about wars
Wow so many rules all over the place, it is hard to keep track of it
I don't have any suggestions for my country
You can be polite and say "thank you", but it is also ok not to
You can have stereotypes and ask about them or you can skip them
We have nice people that will ignore everything, but also angry people that will get angry for saying "excuse me". You can cross the red light or not, it all good
Skip the line if you don't want to wait, it's ok
What will make someone love you will really trigger someone else
No rules, sorry
I remember my friend during our school trip btought a flag with him and thought it would be cool to take a pic with it in front of Hitlers home
He got fined and lectured by a policemen for doing that
Well it is considered some sort of higher end brand, but in general you get what you pay for
Here, we don't really have many high quality furniture brands so we can say IKEA is one of the best out there
It doesn't have a bad name unlike in some other countries
I have a pretty positive experience with them, I have a chair from them (it costed around $140) and the build is just excellent
The armrest and other parts are literally built from some kind of METAL
If you bought a chair for a similar price from a local company the chair parts would be most likely plastic
Also their support is also amazing
That Swedish store that offers high quality furniture
Relatable McDonald's experience
In Serbia, it was seen as a cool place to take your kids to, while in the US it's a sketchy place taken over by hobos
No one thinks it's healthy food, it's more about the status thing
Don't mention Kosovo
or any war that happened on Balkans
or anything about Balkans
there is guaranteed war in the comments in the next 24 hours
this describes the balkans as whole very well lmao
We're just a big cultural mess
Croatian guy is right,just dont mention war
Yup, at least we all agree on that
Joker sucked, while we're at it
[some people were not happy about this map i made]
So Iberia and some of the baltics/finland/scandinavia and russia arent Europe
I know that's why I'm mentioning it
Any post including word Kosovo will start a war between Serbs and Albanians
Also yes
Косово је Србија
totally agree, minus the enjoyment part
Bored me to death
But that's subjective at least
it's a joke map
They didnt follow either the catholic or easterm orthodox churches
I haven't, though I do plan on it for about a month
Ill def check it out soon
West Bulgaria
You mean Hong Kong
Definitely not a fan considering nobody asked us to put one there
It would be fine if US troops were held accountable for their actions
But of course, they rarely are
I'm much more interested in getting the Gladio blacksites out of Europe
Sweden
They went from pagan vikings to christian fanatics to secular social democracy in about 800 years
Russia, from underdogs to the biggest country on earth
I'm a bit biased but it's my own country and people's history then it would be: in medieval and modern era Germany, Russia and France
In ancient world: ancient Greece and Roman empire specifically Roman republic
We are sort of obsessed with Irish bars in the former Yugoslav state, you can find a bunch of them in every capital city
Definetly to the 1970ies, the golden ages of Yugoslavia
I know, by memory or *almost* by memory, the English, French, German, Italian, Croatian, Serbian, Yugoslav, Polish, Russian, Soviet, Chinese, American and Canadian anthems aaand I think that's about it
I used to have an obsession with national anthems
Not so much anymore, but I still love the Italian anthem (the most beautiful in the world to me), and the French and Chinese anthems are very powerful to me too
Besides ours, I know the words of Croatian and Montenegrin anthems and the melody of French, Italian, German, Russian and Polish anthems
I know the old Yugoslav ones and few second Serbian ones
Clothes
They're usualy mega cancerous and try not to go near them(they still dab)
I don't think we have rich people here
Apparently Državni Posao(state job)
It is on air since 2012 at it has 1566 episodes
It is a comedy btw
How popular/loved is Malenczuk in Poland really
I still don't know the language that well to catch stuff like that, I can only see that he has a lot of views on youtube
I find him really charismatic, and i love his voice, but i understand he's somehow controversial
Czy nie
Yes
Torlački, can’t understand a word when the talk to each other
Oh that's really interesting
People living in the far eastern parts of Serbia speak way faster than in the north
I have family from a village near Dimitrovgrad and they use some Bulgarian words too
I'm interested in how the Bulgarian close to Serbia sounds to you
I live in south-eastern Serbia and it used to snow much more like 10 years ago
Now it usually snows only few times per winter and it melts pretty fast
I live in eastern Serbia and I remember there was a lot of snow back when I was a kid (2000s and early 2010) starting from December and sometimes up until mid April
Last year, there were like 2 days of snow in January I think which was like 2 inches and that’s about it
It’s snowing less and less every year now but around 8 years ago it was a lot more
Not to mention the winters are getting warmer, before it would go as low as -20 celsius during winter, last year there were just a few days where temperatures were a bit lower than 0, it was mostly around 3 or 5 celsius
Climate change is definitely real
1783,34
thousands, millions etc don't have separators, even tho sometimes a space is used, while decimals are separated by commas
People here don’t even know that atheists exist
Being an orthodox christian is a norm
My friend from uni knows i’m an atheist, but still, she presumed that i believe in afterlife, i cite her ‘i mean you do believe there is something after death right, like everyone does’ . No, I don’t. I don’t believe
I am an atheist
The most far people go is ‘agnosticism’ . That’s gen Z mostly and gen X, boomers can be atheist since many of them were communist
Edit: 85% of Serb citizens view themselves as orthodox christians
Really depends
Accepted but you what I've realised is that heavily criticising religions is seen as rather rude
If you're atheist you should probably keep it to yourself
Absolutely nothing bad would happen since there's thousands of atheists but it's seen as rude at least among the faithful who are in a majority and likely your family members to openly bash Christianity
I'd stay saying your Christian as a young person is more surprising than saying you're an atheist
atheists are usually not patriotic, hate that they are serbs and are probably from belgrade
It's not so strong here because most of the older people remember communism and Tito with fondness
And judging by their words it was not desirable to be a religious person in Communist Yugoslavia
There is a resurgence of Ortodox church and religion in the last decade, but I think most of those people are cultural Ortodox
The don't believe in God, they just like the traditions that are big part of Serbian culture
I think our current president is not religious but he pays a lip service to the church when it's beneficial to him
You don't see religion mentioned in political discussions or during the elections
Most of the younger crowds don't belive in God
Although I have two friends who are religious and LGBT
I don't know how that works for them but in their company I make a conscious decision not to talk about religion
Most of people here are behaving like atheists
I'm orthodox christian and I know that majority of people in Serbia don't fast when it's supposed to, or don't go to church as many times as they should
If you ask them, they'd say they are christians, but they don't really respect the most of christian values and customs
Atheists are not that common thing here, but they are seen as regular, normal people
I think it's more about the customs than than the religion itself
Most of the people like the customs or observe them because it's proper or because it's something that their parents taught them to do
As from my experience with traveling through BiH - true, wherever you are
The only thing that makes difference- is religion itself changes from A to B to C.
Well, being pro-church was rebelious back then in the 80s-90s. Gen X was provoking their boomer parents
Also, after the overthrow of communism, the predominant ideology became pro-religious, and supports all orthodox christian practices (i’m neutral about that)
The new regime added the study of religion as a subject in both elementary and high schools, and intesified the praise of Saint Sava (our most praised and glorified saint)
So when kids study that in school, they accept it, because they see their teachers as the authoritative sources of knowledge
That’s why zoomers don’t question religion
Their parents became religious, so their parents AND the school system don’t question religion, precisely orthodox christianity
I don’t really care about them, but it is how i said
No while not repressed, it was most definitely frowned upon especially if you were a member of the Communist party, relatively common if you hoped to have any kind of career
We call him [Pičkousti (Pussylips)]
His most popular phrases: 'Silence over there
' and 'Let me ask you something instead'.
We call him "pussymouth" (rough translation lol)
If you see him, you know
Budimpešta [Будимпешта]
Budimpeshta, the 'sh' makes a "š" sound
We say "Budimpešta" as in "Budimpeshta". So to answer your question - with the "sh" sound
When it comes to English, I always say Budapest with S. However in my language it would be Budimpešta, which has SH sound instead
In Serbia they're usually armed with just a pistol but if there is a large football game they are equipped with riot gear
Every single policeman gor a handgun in their holster in Serbia
Nonexistent, dont remember seeing any cycling infrastructure
Here in Serbia you just pray not to get hit by a car
Oh we have fake cycling lanes
So it's shit
We don't have family gathering
We visit each other often but we never make it an event
Numbers have genders and can be declined through grammatical cases
But not all numbers have gender, only one (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two (just m and f)
And only numbers up to 4 can be declined
Why
Nobody knows
And if you count anything anything above 5, the word changes its ending
Jedan slon - one elephant
Dva, tri, četiri slona - two, three, four elephants
Pet, šest
slonova - five, six
elephants
Also women's surname do not decline through grammatical cases
Unless you make them a man's property
Jovanović - just a surname
Jovanovićeva - who is meried to Jovanović
Jovanovićka - whose father is Jovanović
And only then are they declined
*Disclaimer: in modern language, those two are not defined as anybody's property
Most people do not even know the difference
The only reason why the endings stayed is because feminine nouns can't decline if they don't end with "a"*
Gore gore gore gore
Means: Up there the mountains burn worse
Understandable
In Serbian casual speech it would be something like Tata, jesi to ti tu
Since I started using English excessively, going back to my mother tongue feels like stepping from a simple one plus two to incomprehensible equations that solves problems of gravity and mass at superluminal speeds
English is a blunt instrument, like a hammer, while my mother tongue is a thousand scalpels control by alien AI
Have to agree with the emotional part
I find it much easier to talk about my emotions in English, I can't do it in my native language without cringing
But I find Serbian better for some other things, like swearing, direct commands, telling anecdotes
From Bosnia:
Muslims asked Hodza (priest) to explain the difference between dictatorship and a democracy
"Dictatorship is when I climd the minaret (the mosque tower from where priests call people to prayer) and piss on you from abowe
And the democracy is when I climb the minater and piss on you from above "
"So what's the difference
"In democracy, you can freely piss on me
Positive, one of our few reliable and liked neighbors
Really good people besides Greeks our only true friends, interesting fact they are only country that we border that we've never been to war with
From Serbia, we call you our orthodox brothers sometimes
And we enevy you because we see how you are handling your government and we wish we could do the same
Also your living standard has climbed dramatically and surpassed ours sometimes ago
Some of the people still remember the times when we were ahead
Your pop dance music has a lot of listeners here
People like going to Timisoara, although the malls are a bit pricier than here
Very good, actually the best neighbors
Our best neighbours, orthodox brothers
Also it's cool how they don't recognize Kosovo
I didn't realise so many people here are so racist towards Gypsies, holy shit
Great people, beautiful nature, and best neighbours by far
Positively - the  Ceaușescu solution is often brought up when people try to figure out what to do with our politicians
I often hear about a lady judge that rules with an iron hammer and many wish we could borrow her for a month or so
Colorful graveyards are seen as cool and exotic
Can confirm
People speak from experience and almost anyone who has meet gypsies either has themselves had a bad experience or knows someone who has
Could be battle of Rovin 1396 when king Marko Mrnjavcevic fought on Turkish side as vassal against Vallachia he died in same battle,he is also considered biggest hero in our Epics and in reality he was just Turkish vassal
Romania, not us
But yes, even the US
You still have checks and balances even if Donald is ripping everything apart
The courts still can countrol the president
We have a sham here
The president has all the power
Whatever he wants he gets
The courts are independent but only in theory
The parliament is made up from the ruling party and it doesn't work
Opposition is steamroled and ignored
And even that opposition is made up from people who are like president
They were in power before and nothing was different
Well if a majority of encounters people have with gypsies is negative can you really blame them for mistrusting and disliking that people group
Well his father kinda doomed whole Balkans so that was the only thing he could do and save some of his dignity
I wasn't even talking about Romania or Romanians at all, I'm not sure what the point of this is
Here they mostly live in slums and poverty and they prefer it that way
The person who I was responding to didn't even mention Romania what are you on about
I never even mentioned Romania I was just taking about gypsies
Quit putting words in my mouth and embarrassing yourself
[Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary] in Kragujevac
[The Name of Mary Church] better known as the cathedral by locals even though it's not an actual cathedral
It's a roman Catholic church destroyed in 1884 revolutions and has since been completely rebuilt
It's the most recognisable building that's in the city
The most recognisable building however and the one the city is most know for is the
[clock] on the Petrovaradin Fortress
It's featured in all the touristy magnets
[Treaty of Pozarevac/Passarowitz was signed in my city in 1718]
You should visit us sometimes
I think the German word for border "grenzen" comes from some Slavic language
You would be surprised how many words we have in common
-25M here
-Fresh from university (MSc civil Eng
-On my first job (relevant trainee civil eng
ie job in my field of education)
-Unmarried
-Living in the capital city of Serbia
-I don't rent (I own a small studio flat, no debt on it)
**I can manage to save around 200~300€/m** with just a little help from my parents (providing local food one or two times a month that can cover up to one week of food expences)
In conclusion I may not be the best example, but I could say with considerable certainty (also knowing some of my colleagues renting situations) that **majority cannot save more than 100~150€/m, and a lot of people saves nothing
This can vary considering ones lifestyle, saving strategies & discipline and location & number of roommates (ie overall price for renting)
In my opinion, salary is not that significant factor because knowing the market here & if we calculate only **entry level** engineering positions (IT excluded), that small difference wouldn't considerably (non)contribute to savings
Nothing except the change of the language for the worse, I guess
Edit: well now that I think about that, maybe our agriculture will get fucked up, as all the people on the north are farmers, nad those on the south are stockmen
Albanians on the north, Serbs and some Hungarians on the south
It would be a pretty confusing and "How did this even happen" situation
We would have Albanians in our capital but at least Kosovo would truly be Serbia
Ahahahah umirem
Kosovo up Vojvodina down
Yeah but we're not talking what if locations switched place, only if people did
Number of people that smoke and that smoking is allowed indoors, in restaurants and cafes
Same here
I was about to write the same
I took my South African boyfriend to Belgrade last year and he couldn't believe it
It's also the reason why I pick up smoking again whenever I go visit my family
It would feel weird not to smoke
>Vast majority of people are atheist/agnostic and religious people are seen as goofies
Sounds like paradise
I felt as if I returned to a home I never knew
I guess it shocks other normal foreigners :)
I think this is universally a Slavic thing
We don't really smile much (unless there's a good reason for it)
Well they really made me wonder, now I have to go see the rest of Germany :) I know I'll go back to Berlin but hey
Honestly in Serbian it would be impossible to have spelling bee, because every word is written exactly how it is spoken
Every letter match the certain sound
I've heard of that, but we have no such thing
Simply, or language is like Spanish for example
However, it's the only (European) language that is 100% phonetic alongside Macedonian
Meaning we have 30 different voices and 30 respective graphemes, without exceptions
Even loan words or names are transcribed
Washington - Вашингтон (Vašington), randezvous - рандеву (randevu), xylophone - ксилофон (ksilofon)
And as you can see, it's the only (European) language that has two official alphabets
However Latin alphabet isn't 100% phonetic, because it has a few digraphs lj - љ, nj - њ, dž - џ.
99% correct; just:
Each sound has its exact letter;
Some letters can have more than one sound;
But that still makes any chance of some spelling competition- impossible; or everyone a winner
(Na srpskom: “baNka” i “Nikola” su različiti glasovi za N, banka je nazalno; ali i dalje imamo ono što amer nema)
Didn’t you guys have had one spelling till 1989 and another afterwards
(I started learning French in 1990, mais j’ai oublié quelques chose
Absolutely, women are especially pressured to have kids before they're in their late 30s
I'm from one of the smaller countries, so "Hey, we're going to Timisoara (Romania), we will be back by lunch" is not unusual thing to hear
Once, my dad and I were in Greece, decided to do a road trip through Albania, visited a lot of places and went to my grandma's place in Montenegro all in one day
It's kinda easy to visit a lot of countries in a short amount of time, especially by car but because everything is kinda close, I never had a chance to travel by plane
Areas in Belgrade in Serbia built in socialist times are a much better place to live now than the pre-socialist parts of the city mostly because of green spaces, much more space between buildigns etc
Korinđanje - in Serbia or atleast in the Banat region, this used to be like our own halloween
Kids would go door to door and sing a song or a poem and then people would give them candy for it
It depends, here on Balkans changes were so constant one simply can't choose one for all periods
I would say
[Rasti, rasti] - medival Serbia
[Ajde Jano] - 18-19 century Serbia (although I prefer Nigel Kennedy and Kroke Band interpretation, this one is more "natural".
[Drina March] - 20th century
and unfortunately, probably some turbo-folk shit like this [trash] the '90s.
And another one from, let's say Yugoslavia
>Norwegian Wood
[Hvis lyset tar oss]
Belgrade means White City, and, well
it's not white at all
I don't think it's even at all
For me there's a world difference from Warsaw to Gdansk or Torun
I'm not Polish so I can't say what feels more 'domestic' to you, but Warsaw had a distinct eastern/middle Europe feel to it, and cities like Gdansk obviously feel and look much more like western/northern Europe
Anyhow, I find Poland in whole exceptionally lovely
No, it’s hard to learn, we have  cases, weird accentuation rules etc
Let it be french
It’s not that hard believe me, it’s easier than fucking english
Nah, we are adopting Montenegrin standard
I mostly use Cyrillic but when I am on the computer i use Latin
Cyrillic for handwriting, and Latin on the computer, phone and Internet mostly
Although for certain things, like essays, or something more formal I like to use Cyrillic
Also, when filling in blank spaces on documents or questionnaires or something like that I write in the script that the document is printed in, I usually don't like mixing scripts
In general, I match the script to its "environment", as it should be done
I only write my own signature in Cyrillic (which is also in cursive)
Everything else in Latin - especially computer-related
I don't even have a Cyrillic keyboard enabled on my PC
Cyrillic is preferred in schools and the official/government-issued documents
I did use Cyrillic a lot back in my school days but I really can't remember the last time I wrote something with pen and paper that is not like a sticky-note
Nowadays I would usually write these in Latin
It is Cyrillic handwritten, Latin online for most people
I know some patriots and literature fans who use Cyrillic online and I know some people who use exclusively Latin but for the most part people use Cyrillic when writing and Latin when typing
I use exclusively latin, i learned to read very early when i was maybe 5 or 6 years old, i don't even remember exactly  when and how (probably it came with comics and footbal albums with sticker images i adored)
It was natural and built into me because all those imported press and materials
It was in the '80's, still Yugoslavia
I know cyrilics, i don't even aknowledge which alphabet is when i read, but i am having big problems when i need to write especialy cursive which is required in some situations, for example when you need to write the statement in the bank during signing promissory note
Then it gets really embarassing, once some lady had to guide my hand to remind me of damn cursive T.
If I am writing by hand I start first word cyrillic, than on the middle of third word switch to latin and by fifth I am writing english and than end up writing english pronunciations in Cyrillic
Latin 90% of the time
Unless it is required or if I'm filling a form that's in cyrillic for example, I'd go for cyrillic then
When I have a choice I use Cyrillic almost exclusively
As an MD at work when using medical systems I have to write in Latin, which is  there out of inertia and convenience in order to not switch constantly between Cyrillic and Latin when writing out diagnosis and other Latin (language) medical terms
I pretty much write only in Latin unless I'm required to write in Cyrillic, or if the document I'm filling out is in Cyrillic
Never found Cyrillic very visually pleasing for some reason, so I tend to avoid it
I like Cyrillic more but often I have to use Latin a lot when talking with Bosnians or Croatians
Also there are a lot of places in Serbia with things written in Latin
When i write on Serbian i type on Cyrillic 99% of the time
I think Cyrillic is in great danger now, and in my opinion we should write on the most beautiful alphabet more
Latin, it's hard to type on cyrllic keyboard and i got used to latin because i don't have to change keyboard when i want to type in English after typing in Serbian
I used to use cyrilic cursive in handwriting, and latin online, but then, it looks odd when you have chemistry formula or english or french, so I switched to latin
Then on uni, I went full latin, because of chemistry, and now I’m almost always use latin
Oh gosh of course latin, if I could I would just snap those people that type like this: Бил Гејтс (Bill Gates)
So awful and annoying
Latin; almost always- Cyrillic only on government documents
I use Latin on the internet but i write in cursive Cyrillic most of the time as force of habit
T in Serbian cyrllic is literally from Chernobyl
We have keyboards that have Latin letters that are present in Serbian Latin script like š,č,ć,đ
Cyrillic is mandatory on tests and reports and books are on Cyrillic
I also know few professors that would give you an F for writing in latin
Nope, just the regular script you use for English, but the Serbian version with some added letters like šđćčž
The Latin script
Unfortunately I don't know roman Latin language, that would be pretty badass
Although I'm thankful I didn't have to learn it in school, as it was a pain in the ass for everyone
90% letters are  same but Y and Z are swaped
Q=љ W=њ X=џ and we have few letters bonus 2 next to P (ш ђ) 3 next to L (ч ћ ж)
Oh and most things like )(\*(#($)&#)$(<L><?": are completly diffrent keys
1999 wars
I can't decide between creating Yugoslavia or creating second Yugoslavia
The battle of Maritza (1371) and Yugoslav wars (1991-1999)
That mistake has many names, just like the devil: State SHS, Kingdom SHS, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, FNRY, SFRY
Yugoslavia, a mistake we repeated twice
Heard of breaking Yugoslavia
Probably "electing" Tito and the establishment of communist socialism in Yugoslavia
There is this dead meme in the Serbian community that Bulgarians are backstabbers because of that war
Lmao true
Second really, in first we forgave ethnic cleansing
In the second we forgave outright genocide
no one thought it'd not become a full scale war, both sides simply thought they'd win quickly
WW1 was unlike any war before it
For me, personally it's
Cold <2°C
Chilly 3°C - 19°C
Nice 20°C - 26°C
Warm 27°C - 31°C
Hot >30°C
Freezingly cold anything below -15
Cold -15 to 0
Chilli 0 to 15
Warm/pleasant 15 to 30
Hot 30 to 40
Kinda same here, but hot for me is 28+
Red Star Belgrade (Crvena Zvezda) in my opinion
Simplicity and quality
We should give them sea of Serbia
That way Hungary and North Macedonia could have a coast and God knows that Bosnia needs some of it too
We should be transfered somewhere in the Pacific
Screw you, guys, were rowing home
I'd probably say our hospitality
and if Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania chip in, we'll be the most hospitable place on earth
Wooden shoes
Basically for here in Serbia its:
Medicine; I mean you can pretty much guess why but our medicine faculty is decent and our doctors are capable, even so a lot get offers from the germans and such to come there and work
Engineering; again a no brainer since our best uni is the Electical Tehnical Faculty where most of our engineers go, if ya go there you also get offered a job pretty much by the 2and or 3rd year and I do mean that literally
My friend got a contract from BMW and works for them in Munich
Likewise another one got a contract in his 3rd year by Nvidia
Law; I myself study and go to this faculty and there is always a job open
Ironically more and more lawyers are in demand since now ya basically, at least here, almost all the time ya need a lawyer to do some shit like check yer contract, make the contract, represent ya and whatnot
Plus ya can do many stuff and work in many areas with this like social services, notary (the lad that that puts in the stamp to guarantee the validity of a document like yer will or legalise some shit)
Specially since our IT sector (I will get to it next) is booming a lot of startup IT companies are demanding us to legally represent them and write the contracts
You wont believe the legal nightmare it is for these, specially ownership of the codes they write
copyright is a pain as you can tell let alone lines of code
IT; yup much like the whole of balkans computer science is booming
The IT sector is becoming the main thing here and the market is in high demand for programmers
The pay is really good too
My bro is doing his masters in this and man the contract he got is
really nice
He just has to finish his masters which is soon now
Agriculture; ye here it's a big thing and one of our main industries
More and more young people are starting to do this here and this is excellent bc a lot go aboard and get better deals
A lot even come back here
My cousin came back from Germany to our countryside village and  he inherited a big chunk of land
He legit makes a killing from vegetables and dairy
He is more and more selling domestically and less aboard to help out here, similarly his peers too
Our [Slava] custom
I though that was something all Orthodox Christians did, but it turns out that's a very specific thing unique to our culture
Similar to you, I thought our barbecue street food was universal
Turns out hamburgers are an American food to you
Also, didn't know that people in most other countries use cofee-makers instead of [this
When I was on a skiing trip to Malyovitsa, I was playing pool (billiards) in the hotel and wanted to buy another round
I walk up to the girl that works there and ask her for more coins and she looks me dead in the eyes and shakes her head, without saying a word
I stand there thinking "why can't I play more, it's not even late, they're still open, other guys are playing too, is it something I said, did I offend her
" when she comes back and hands me the coins with a smile
I was looking at her confused for a couple of seconds and then I remembered
Even though I knew about the custom, it really takes some getting used to
[pretty widespread here]
> Sugar-coated
>  or chocolate-coated almonds being the typical Easter treat
[we have something similar, they're coated peanuts though]
yes, literally no country besides France can master that 5 ingredient staple food lasting for millenias
Most of our Orthodox customs are originally pagan, even the Christmas ones - paljenje badnjaka etc
We do
Obv havent been to Belgrade, theres a bakery like every 100m
Exactly, but people usually think it's the most Christian thing ever
Croatia
Probably Croatia, i don't care what others think its simply true
Umm
Hello there
We screwed up badly in the last thirty years
Also the Roma
They underwent compulsory sterilization in Sweden as late as 1976
I think the treatment of Muslims in Mojkovac and Kolašin is the least often mentioned atrocity in Montenegro's history
i don't think even Croats think that Croatia is innocent
but world thinks
Montenegro wasn't called Serbian Sparta for nothing
We have Vojvodina and Kosovo (depending on who you ask)
Vojvodina has cultural and political autonomy since the creation of Second (Communist) Yugoslavia, but most of their economy is state - controlled
For Kosovo, serb - populated parts are controlled by state, while others (mainly albanian - populated Kosovo parts) are not
When I was on tour of it (by boat) we were told that only 2 female species are allowed on the island, chicken, for their eggs which are essential for producing certain icons, and cats, to keep the mice population at control, now I am not sure how do they control other female species but female cats are allowed
We also eat a lot of dumplings (plum is more common than apricot though), and I assume that we got that during Austria-Hungary occupation of Vojvodina which is north region of Serbia
In Belgrade there is a small chain of pastry shops called "[Ferdinand knedle] and they produce all kinds of different combinations of tastes, both, sweet and salty variations
Check it out if you get a chance
edit: typo
Gomboce
Avala tower, Golubac, Kalemegdan and a few other forts and the most disturbing one, Ćele kula
Monument to an unknown hero on Kalemegdan fortress or Petrovaradin Fortress
I think because of Exit festival, Petrovaradin fortress is more famous to foreigners
It is Saint Sava 100%, I think all of those guy above you mentioned are famous, but not that distinguishable
Saint Sava temple is probably the most famous building in Serbia
I literally don't know anyone that ever ate raw meat
bonus points if its your own dog
Here we eat soup almost every day
It's a really big part of our cuisine
2 times:
?(around 8th century)-1459 (Ottomans took over)
1878 (officially, though we had maximal autonomy and de facto independence decades before)-present
3000AD/7th centry-Random Euroasian horde(we were 2000 years late wtf)
7th cebtry/1166-A Byzantine Вазал
1166/1371-Nemanjic age
1867/1914-Independence
1919/1940-Yugo 1
1945/2006Yugo 2
2006/now-Just Serbia
From 630/780 (depends who you ask) until 1459 (important note although in early period we were mostly independent and kinda doing our own thing, we were as well briefly occupied or annexed by Byzantines or Bulgarians for some short periods, this as well includes all Serb inhabited states like Raška, Duklja, Travunija and Paganija)
Then from 1459-1804 part of Ottoman empire, uprising in 1804 great autonomy 1830, independence 1878 this lasted until 1915 when were occupied by Austrians, Germans and Bulgarians liberated in 1918, then kingdom of Yugoslavia until 1941 (1945 in exile) then commie times until end of Yugoslav wars 1995, union with Montenegro until 2006 and then modern day Republic of Serbia,
Side note: i can't really count times when Serbia was part of Yugoslavia, since Yugoslavia was mostly Serb dominated, especially Kingdom of Yugoslavia
Serbia under Nemanjić rule
Serbia from 1878-1921
Serbia today
Tribe*
You do know that Serbian Despotate was conquered only in 1459 right
The Independent State of Croatia wasn't really independent
Do all (or most) Russian nationalists have a unified view of the USSR
What is it
Its the moment I realized
I fucked up
I fucked up again
Sienna
Really nothing *that* special
Also Pisa
It's top three interesting things are the tower, the cathedral, and then the Subway nearby
Literally nothing to see or do there except take a picture and leave
The rest of Tuscany was absolutely breathtaking, though
(Edit: Subway as in the fast food chain)
I live in Novi Sad and Belgrade is really near but I avoid going there
It's so noisy and dirty
Even though Novi Sad is becoming like that I have a feeling that Belgrade is on whole other level
Me too
Athens is a bit
gritty in some parts, but there are so many wonderful things to see, such an interesting city
Thessaloniki was lovely
I love Greece overall, there is no part I didn't like, and a was there like 10 times
I was on Corfu this summer, the city and the whole island is beyond beautiful
Ancient Rome, Ancient Greek and Otoman empire are the 3 cultures that we learn the most
We also learn about other major cultures, and spend some time with them, like Mongolian empire or Huns among others
While any other culture that has little to no impact on us (all people, or just Serbs) are only mentioned and we don't go too deep into them
In Serbian, every letter is pronounced, well, as it is supposed to
H is pronounced as H in hard, hot, hell
Its always pronounced, and is the same as h in hello
Unlike spanish or italian, for example, it doesn't change surrounding letters
For example "ch" in spanish, or "ci" and "chi" in italian
Not really i'd love to visit every European country (yes even the microstates)
I wouldn't visit Moldova because i think it's boring there
What
Where do you have to do that
'U pički materini' which translates to 'In a mother's pussy'.
Obviously a slang term but commonly used to refer to something far away
Bogu iza nogu - behind god's legs
In Serbian there are multiple expressions meaning "really far away". The most polite one is "Bogu iza nogu" which means "behind God's legs", there is "u pizdi materinoj" which means "in the mother's cunt", "u tri lepe" which literally means "in three beautiful", but refers to three beautiful cunts (I find that pretty weird myself)
We also have an expression with a toponym - "Tunguzija" - which refers to the Evenkiysky District in Russia
"Bogu iza nogu" Behind God's legs
"Pičkovci" Cuntville
"Vukojebina" ¿a place were wolves fuck
My personal favorite is "vukojebina" (a place where wolves fuck)
That one works too, yeah
Not really something they said, but my friend and I helped a group of Chinese tourists find a park/fortress they were looking for
All 20 of them then proceeded to take selfies with us
Asking if there are Mountains in Austria is like looking for potatoes in Ireland
>He wanted to show his son, that people my age do work here in Denmark
He apparently found it very inspirational
Having worked with the Japanese for the past 5 years, this doesn't surprise me at all
My friend moved to Shanghai with her husband and son and when they went to Disneyland recently, so many Chinese visitors wanted a photo with her son
He is a blonde and blue eyed kid, pretty tall for his age and he was treated like a movie star
The kid had a blast
My blonde, blue-eyed friend and my ginger friend went to Shanghai too and had the same experience
I do have blonde hair and she has blue eyes, so that might've been it
They're funny tourists in general, always in groups and snapping pictures of everything
Not necessarily normal, but considering their work ethic and the increasing number of NEETs that the older generations frown on, it makes perfect sense
I had a Japanese student who worked in Germany and he was delighted to tell me kids had Praktikum and another one who visited Denmark and had a similar reaction to the country's organization
Edit: I meant to say that the Japanese make sure to instill the "law, order and discipline" in their children as early in life as possible, so you can imagine how what you mentioned appeals to them
I don't know if those would be Ukrainian loanwords to Russian
Those examples are common Slavic words that, for one reason or another,  stopped being used that way in Russian
I don't know Russian or Ukrainian, though
Besides learning breaf world and European history, my historical education went something like this:
6th century, slavs migrate to Balkan
Skip
12th to 15 century: Nemanjić dinasty, we get church authonomy, this guy bilt this monastery, this one built this, one guy reads a lot about Alexander the great and wants to be roman empire, but he dies, and his son is bad, so empire falls appart, then we fight Ottomans, win the battle but loose most of the army and nobility, so Ottomans conquer us
Skip to seage of Vienna, the holy league wins, so Serbs rebel, but Austrie doesn't give a sht, so the great migration of Serbs
Skip to 1804, first uprising, we do good, but Napoleon invades Russia; so we loose, but then we fight again in 1814, and win, and cultural and national renesance, language standardised, wars with Turks and constantly fearing Austria
Absolutism, constitution, absolutism, constitution, we become a kingdom, but then king is sht, and his son is even bigger sht, so we kill him, and bting the other dinasty, then the assassins accidentally start WW1, we win, but then we loose, retreat to Corfu, paybeck time, we win, make yugoslavia, but serbs and croats dont cooperate, so absolutism, then king gets killed, germany wants us in axis, but nope
WW2 time, occupied in 2 weeks, but nope, for we are used to rebelling at this point, so we fight germans, and civil war at the same time
Communists win, liberated, Yugoslavia 2
0, socialism y'all
We say no to soviets, almost go to war, then Stalin dies, then Soviets invade hungary, we almost go to war, then Soviets invade Czechoslovakia, almost to war
Then Tito dies, we mennage to get by for 10 more years, thwn 90s start, and we finally have a war, so we killed each other a bit, this guy thinks he is Tito, so America decides to help us by bombing the sht out of us, then we owerthrow Milošević.
That would be 12 years of my history education in one longer reddit comment
Edit:6th century slavic migration, not 9th
Dont ask
Our books just cram everything in 4 years,not looking if its important or not
Its hard af
Like others have said we don't learn year by year more like by hundred years and periods
We also don't learn about our own countries history (well obviously we do) but how it fits into a whole European narrative
For instance we have:
• Slavic Balkan settlements
• Christianised, feudal medieval time
• Turkish occupation for centuries (this is the time we usually focus on the rest of Europe and we skip a couple of hundred years)
• Serbian uprising, independence, proclamation of the Kingdom
• This nicely leads into WW1, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, WW2, Cold War and then you're done
This is all a 4 year process
Technically 8 since in elementary school you learn the same thing but less details
Belgrade is called Beograd in Serbian
Beograd = beo (white) + grad (city), so White City
Acording to some sources when Slavs came to this area they saw white Roman/Celtic walls of the old fortifications and that is how it got its new name
Romans used to call it Singidunum before that
Belgrade (originally Beograd) comes from the words "beo" meaning white, and "grad" meaning city
It was named that because the fortress looked white from the river
Furthermore, "grad" comes from Indo European word for closed space in open, which is the same word that "garden" came from, however the meaning here shifted more towards a closed space by walls, for defense
They ‘predu’. Mačka prede= A cat purrs
The infinitive is ‘predeti’
The noun is ‘predenje’
*I've seen enough internet to know where this is going*
Belgrade university
It's basically the same everywhere
The age-old trope of stereotypical Russian / Ambigously Slavic bad guys and villains in Hollywood action films
&#x200B;
We'd just highkey root for them the entire time, I feel - so it's a lost cause to even attempt that plot-device with us
Missing a Croatian sentence: "Za slavu unije"
Glava, ramena, stomak, kolena
Glava, ramena, stomak, kolena
Oči, uši, usta medena
Glava, ramena, stomak, kolena
Head, shoulders, stomach, knees
Head, shoulders, stomach, knees
Eyes, ears, honey-sweet mouth
Head, shoulders, stomach, knees
We have lazy ass politicains that can be paid to do anything
They say,,Wages are up by 3% this month"while they're same or lower than last few months
Are you the Pope
About 20€ per week
But that is just for me
That seems about right for me too
Oh we all heard that one
well that's more understandable
Hey if it gets him the votes from a demographic he needs, it's not stupid
to them
yeah, just be a nazi ally
Not EU but I believe only citizens should be allowed to vote including citizens living outside the country
I doubt that there are many 45+ year old Easter Europeans visiting reddit who could give you their first hand experience with communism
Speaking from experience of my older family members they lived way better lives than they and most of my generation live today
Though Yugoslavia is not so great example since it was open to the west
And since our standard of living drastically decreased during the wars in the '90s.
As a personal example, my parents were born just after WW2
They were never members of the party (my mother is also Italian, my grandfather was even imprisoned for a few years after WW2 because of that)
Both of them had only high school education and worked in a steel mill as an administrative workers
And with their salaries they could afford to go on vacations to Greece, Spain, Malta, Tunissia, Italy, Germany, France
They also got large appartment from a company they worked at and were able to buy it out in a few years (companies were building appartment complexes for their workers and giving them an option to buy them out by deductiong monthly payments from their salaries with some minimal interest rates)
At the same time they also got and repaid bank loan which they used to build a summer vacation house
I'm currently lucky enough to earn few times more than the average sallary in here, and I won't be able to afford one fifth of that
Hell it took me 5 years of investments just to fully renovate entire appartment
And my mother is stuck with 200 euros per month pension
It was better than now
I mean we are starting to rebuild from NATO aggression slowly so I hope it will be better
>After the fall of communism the transition to free-market was brutal not even regarding the fact of systemic corruption
You guys were lucky, you "only" had to deal with those issues :)
We also had to deal with wars, hyperinflations and economic sanctions
In '90s steel mill my parents worked at lost all of it's foreign market and supliers
And they successfully worked with companies from Japan to Canada during the '70s and '80s.
At one point everything was so bad that instead of salaries they were giving workers half rotten pig's meat, powdered milk, 10 year old laundry detergent and worthless coupons
At the end factory was bombed in 1999, what was left of it was bankrupted and sold to the Americans
Saddest thing is that this is still a positive story more or less
After all that it is now owned by Chinese and it is currently largest exporter in Serbia
At least you are now "free" of srbocetniks, and we are "free" of ustasa
At least until we meet each other in Germany as gastarbeiter
Yes I know tito was killing Serbs and I can't forgive him
I didn't personally live under communism but I hear everyone saying it's was so good, that they had money to go to like turkey nearly every summer
Most ironic thing is that easiest way to end up as a political prisoner in Yugoslavia, at least until mid '50s, was to be Stallinist or Soviet leaning in general
Swedish seems like a good language for rap music
My friend made a joke "He who digs a hole beneath someone is physical worker"(Ko pod drugim jamu kopa fizicki je radnik)
I can travel to Bosnia, Montenegro, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia, I can understand about 30-40% of Bulgarian and for some reason Turks understand me better when I speak Serbian rather than English even though I cant understand any Turkish at all even if they spoke very slowly
We often joke about how Yugoslavia will reunite inside Germany

Shit just went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick
i mean, the only difference between the two is the wealth, it seems
Also don't forget Bosnia had a recent war which is the reason for the discord between the people, Belgium on the other hand doesn't even have a war to blame that on lol
Bosnia of course
[This map is pretty accurate for ExYu]
Bosnia, Montenegro,turkey

I used to work with a bloke from England and in the winter, he would always smoking outside wearing just a dress shirt
We would freeze just by looking at him
Or you know, you could buy Vojvodina and have big fertile region
Our current politicians would be more than willing to sell for the right price and I don't think people would mind being part of Norway
100% safe
Did it myself alone a lot of times (anywhere between 12 am and 5 am)
Novi Sad is a city of 300k people and I feel completely safe at all times
I had a habit of late night runs and it was nice and quiet with streets mostly empty
There are few drunken beggars but they keep to themselves
Yes the [Gusle]
Well it is really hard to pinpoint one event since for the last 2k years something is always going on in my region (Balkan) and city (Belgrade, Serbia)
Its really tourbolent area
But like I would maybe say that some of the interesting facts about Belgrade is that in its long history (3rd century BC) there were 115 recorded battles over it and it was razed to the ground 44 times
Gore - up/forests/mountains
More - sea

Belgrade
You can get a 120-50 sqm apartment in Belgrade waterfront (the massive high-end housing project being built at the moment)
You could also buy pretty much any appartment in Belgrade
Prices vary from ~1000e to ~5000e per square meter depending on the neighbourhood
You could also buy the vast majority of houses, with the exception of a few neighbourhoods with high-end mansions where you won't have enough for the more expensive ones
Scott in serbian (but spelled with k and only one t, same proncinantion) means basterd/son of a bitch
Weirdly enough, ala is archaism in Serbian and have similar meaning
And former USA ambassador to Serbia had a last name Scott, so his pr used to ask the journalists to (inacurately) transcribe his name into Skat, so it wouldn't resemble Skot (son of a bitch) that much lol
So, what's your name for English people then
Lmao everything is in English
Most people in Europe (especially the youth) are bilingual (English+ their native language)
Edit for clarification: by bilingual, I meant that they're able to communicate in English without a huge problem, not that they're absolutely flawless in speaking it
Rural areas sure, but I've never had issues communicating with locals in any city, bigger town, or tourist destinations, and I've been lucky enough to travel a lot
Most people I've met around Europe speak English - maybe not always fluently, but enough to be able to communicate
By 'bilingual' I just mean enough to understand them, yknow
The youth is great at English, though
I think the rise of social media, especially with the dominant websites being primarily in English (reddit, tumblr, insta, 9gag, deviantart, youtube…) has definitely contributed to that
Video games, music, movies, and other kinds of media have also played a huge role in that, too
I have a
I mean, if 55-60% speak another language, isn't that most people being bilingual
I mean there's 700+ million people and over 40 countries, it always depends on the country lol
In general they're pretty good at it though
I clarified in another comment about what I mean by bilingual
Also, I highly doubt that
I'm from an underdeveloped Eastern European country and most young people I've met (lets say people in high school and college) are perfectly capable of watching a movie in English and understand what's going on
I won't speak for your country, but I had the pleasure of visiting it several times (it's really beautiful) and everyone I spoke to was perfectly fine speaking English
depends on the country
I wouldn't say so for Serbia
I don't notice people mess up grammar and spelling more often, but I do notice more people using anglicisms, both existing ones and non-existing ones
Then again, Serbian had historically been very open to borrowing words, so
You may be surprised, but German dialects have more variety than Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian/Montenegrin/whatever

Pros: Good food
Cons: low salaries (bad economy) + for Belgrade: too many people, pollution, bad public transport
Pros:Weather,cheap,not too many people, education, nightlife,fast internet connection,5G rolled out in 2019 in Subotica and Belgrade,memes,there are no vegans running up to you and annoying you
Cons: Immigrants, Corruption,(un)safety,a war can break out any moment,cancer(nato uranium '99),the most annoying famous people and ,,Gasers",the most incompetent politicians(reply for explanation),a stubborn minister of education trying to ruin it

Hello new neighbours
I really like Polish patriotic song "Rota" and the Russian "Sacred War" as well as the Slovak anthem "Nad Tatrou sa blýska"
2014 floods were pretty bad, 16 municipalities were flooded or around 1/4th of the territory was affected, 57 people died and over €500mil in damage
2010 Kraljevo earthquake (5
4 on Richter scale, VII-VIII on Mercalli scale), over €100mil in damage
1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, estimated $26 billion in economic losses, over 1000 killed, 5700 wounded, large infrastructure damage, hospitals, buildings, roads, bridges, factories, refineries and what is the largest issue is rapid increase of cancer patients thanks to the uranium used in bombs
Balkaners are stereotyped as being drunk on rakija, which is far from truth
If we talk about most consumed alcoholic beverages in Serbia (in particular), rakija would be about 4th or 5th place, certainly below beer and wine and probably even vodka aswell
Honestly i believe it's Ćevapi
We eat it when we go out in kafanas and restaurants and rarely i believe as a linch or dinner
We eat Burek and pljeskavica much more
we eat it in serbia during christmas holidays
It's popular with rural folks, but for city ones it's not that popular

Supper old one witch is not in use like past 1300ish years but its part of culture now
in old days (pagan) it was belived to you can only be Hexed/cursed if the one who is casting it on you know your name, so 1st presone who gave you name was not your parents it was close persone to them (today its equivalent to godfather), and that persone would be only one who knows your name, later parent picked name that they and other people called you by
now that name is "church name" still godfather give it to you will you baptise
Vojvodina for a region, and Novi Sad/Subotica as cities which are in Vojvodina
Oh thanks, I feel a sourge of local patriotism now
Not related to the question or your comment, I just want to ask how is programming in Russia (education for it and as a job)
That's nice to hear, I might study in Moscow and it'll probably be something IT-related
Thank you
I'm gonna start attending real courses in September, but I did learn some very very basic stuff over the internet already
It's indeed a very similar language to ours, one notable difference I caught is that it has many English words, while Serbian doesn't and instead has a lot of Turkish words (since we were ruled by them for 5 centuries)
Maybe 60% of the vocabulary are words I already know from Serbian and English, and the grammar is very similar to Serbian
So yeah, much easier for someone like me to learn Russian than a let's say American
Trust me Eastern Europe is a huge mess
Cheap and quite popular because of it
I dont think it is, no
It's not considered bad either though
Good markets are Maxi, Aroma and Univerexport I'd say
Followed by Idea
We consider Lidl good, but that's because of the prices, not quality, for that we go to the local markets
In my country its mediocre
Its cheap but bad quality
Of course, I've got plenty of female friends and dude friends and we all hang out with each other
Nothing weird about it, in fact I enjoy it more this way
Here it's totally normal, at least in Belgrade
Most people I know have platonic friendships of the opposite sex, and no one really questions it
yeah, of course they can
granted, older people will always assume that you're interested in each other but assuming things is their job
Yea ofc
Ah, going for coffee, the thing which solves all problems in our region

780 or 630, first known ruler of Serbia Viseslav ruled from 780 to 829, so excluding Turkish and periodic Byzantine rule we've  existed in some form for 1240 up to 1390 years but including Turkish and periodic Byzantine/Bulgarian  rule it would be something like 850 or 1000 years
Around 8th century, similar with Croatia
It's older than the universe
Sometime around 780 the Principality of Serbia was proclaimed
It's a double edged sword though
We actually did, it was named “home economics” (domaćinstvo), when I went to primary school, was in 6th grade (we start at 7yo), so I was 6th grade sometime during 1992; was Yugoslavia, we had civil war and world sanctions and whatnot - so our home economics class was - only a theory
No cooking, per se, whatsoever
Fucking turning lathes
We *had* to use that thing for every little insignificant thing
It was a part of *general technical education* class
Not sure if it exists anymore, but it didn't use to be gendered
There also used to be a "homekeeping" (domaćinstvo) class, but it got canceled nation-wide during the early '90s.
If it's citizenship by ancestry I'm in favour of it
If your grandparents or parents moved away to another country but you want to return you should be able to get citizenship
People like this be really tend to want to learn the language anyways
I don't know my neighbours, but some of my friends do and talk with them sometimes
Same
God damn it, how many pictures can one appartment hold
And is it necessary to hang it right now
One would think that we appreciate culture that much just by drilling holes any time of a 24h day
Belgrade, Serbia here
My commute to school is around 20mins with the waiting on the bus stop
But the comfort level is like 0 because most of the time the bus is overcrowded
Belgrade
I work in the old city center, so it's really expensive to park there, and impossible/unsafe to bike there (no bike lanes, no bike parking stands), so I'll either walk for 45 minutes or ride the bus for 10-30 minutes, depending on how the traffic is
I miss biking, and yearn for better public transport planning
Klaus, Freya, Ragnar and Baldur sound really cool and powerful
Ana-Maria, although not foreign anymore it's quite rare
Liam, Leo
I like those
Halina (Polish) or Persephone (Greek) for a girl
When it comes to male names, I really like Welsh ones, the spelling and everything - Rhys, Aled, Owain, Gwylim
Cleetus, Skeeter, Duck
Here's some other cool Slavic names: Ratomir, Caslav, Vlastimir, Rastislav, Cedomir and many others
I'd say that there is a lot of variations of same names across Slavic nations
45; sometimes never
Girls move out when they get married, and guys stay with their parents and bring their wife home
Joking aside, I moved out sometime around 25, my friends moved out anytime between 18-30, though later was more common
I'm in my early thirties now, no one of my friends lives with parents anymore
Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be able to live like that either, I moved out a year ago (I'm 24) and more and more people move out, but many still live with their parents, especially outside the big cities
It's a cultural thing
I guess more people own their houses here than in West Europe or the US, so they would probably get them anyway after their parents' died
(So why just not wait there haha)
everything
I saw an inscription in Serbian at a university library toilet door in the Netherlands
It was really weird, because all the other inscriptions were in English and they were really inspiring such as 'Just keep going' etc
but the one in Serbian said 'Kakve su ti sise, takav ti je život', which means 'As are your boobs, such is your life'.
Yep
So is the myth
This
It's not about what race they are, but what they do
Problem is not the color of their skin
It's their behaviour
Do you people not get that
not me, I find it boring
[Serbian Epic poetry] impressed Goethe so much that he spoke some Serbian in order to understand it better, Goethe compared beauty of SEP to the "Song of Solomon".
Did thay bomb muslims or serbs
You'd be surprised how many countries have variations of baked beans
In Serbia, it's called prebranac
hahah same, we call it kids champagne, though we also have it sold regularly
There is a soup like variation of beans in all ex-Yugoslavian countries but prebranac is much thicker
When it's well made (especially in a traditional clay made pot) with paprika and Bay leaves its pure art
That Serbia started WW1 and wars on Balkans in the '90s
We buy the same beers we usually do
But we do have special homemade brandies for holidays, they are usually more than 50% alcohol
Yes, very common in Eastern Europe especially in villages or suburbs
What's an air heat pump
Googled but I'm not sure if I get it, like an air conditioning unit but used only for heating
Yeah, that's what made me wonder, Sweden and air pumps
We use them here and we usually call them inverters
Our winters are pretty mild compared to Sweden or the USA, at least that's my ignorant expectation
I used this kind of heating myself, and my electricity bill surprised me in a happy sense, but we don't get too far below zero
Yeah, that's what I heard about the units we can get
And it surprised me, the way the unit can work even at -20, it's mindblowing that you actually make the winter even colder so you can get warm :)
We reached our peak then and we learn about it, but not too much since it didn't last long
they gave coffee to the entire Europe technically
It was an empire
We had 2 emperors: Dušan Silni and Uroš Nejaki
Dušan formed the empire and it was insanely huge in size, but he died at a young age and his son Uroš was too young and unprepared to rule such an empire, so like 15 higher class people divided the empire and all wanted to rule it and become the emperor, then the Ottomans came and took everything
Osaka (cherry blossoms)
Tokyo (capital)
Kyoto (ex-capital I think)
Hiroshima (nuke)
Nagasaki (nuke)
Kobe (like the basketball player)
Saitama (like the One Punch Man character)
Nagoya (don't know why I remember this one)
Kawasaki (like the Kawasaki bikes)
Yokohama (not sure how I know this one either)
I know a few more names but I think they are districts of Tokyo, also is Himeji a city as well
I remember it after the castle
Nothing else comes to mind, majority of places I remember are by associating them with an object or a person
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Kobe, Nagoya, Nagasaki, Niigata, Aomori, Sendai, Sapporo, Hakodate, Kumamoto, Fukuoka
I don't know about stuff like Saitama and Chiba, it's all Tokyo to me
Srbija to Tokyo
I would say Milan Nedić, the head of provisional government of rump Serbia under direct German military occupation
Previously, he was participant in first world war and in Serbia retreat across Prokletije mountains and Albania which was greatly valued in Serbia, later, he was an officer in Yugoslav army and subsequently general chief of staff of the army
Germans appointed him and during his rule Serbia was partitioned between Albania, Bulgaria, Independent republic of Croatia and Hungary, there was numerous crimes against civilians
He was arrested by Yugoslav partisans and he auto defenestrated himself while waiting his trial
He was not a pre WWII hero in a sense like marshal Peten was, but the Germans used him as somewhat a figure of some authority
A lot of Serbs start referring to Vuk Branković when they talk about stuff like that
Or it just gets used in normal conversations as a joke where they tell you that you shouldn't be Vuk Branković.
During the Battle for kosovo in 1389, Emperor Lazar and his Vassals were fighting the Ottomans and Vuk was also there
He had the biggest army in the old Serbian Kingdom, so they relied on him
And just as it seemed that Serbia would win that battle, he misteriously retreated and left the Emperor and other Soldiers to fight alone, causing them to lose and die
No one has ever found out the reason why he did it
But still he is regarded because of that as the biggest traitor of Serbia
In our tales Vuk Branković betray Kneza(idk translation of Knez) Lazara but he did not betray him
He saw that the battle at Kosovo is over and got his army back at Serbia
He was participating in battles
I think thata biggest traitor was Milos Obrenovic
Yes he got Seebia independent but killed Karadjordja greats hero Serbia have seen
Imho, Nedić did the best he could in his very limited position, he did stuff like keep the border with Croatia open so Serb refugees could flee
He also tried to get on some German generals good side, so Serbia could be in a bit of a better position
Although he is a collaborationist, he wasn't the worst by far
Dimitrije Ljotić on the other hand is our biggest traitor by far, he and his men slaughter Serb, Roma, Jew civilians right there with the Nazis
Absolute piece of shit
This is very poorly written and also has useless information
Vuk Branković is only a traitor in literature because he pulled out of the battle, and Miloš Obrenović simply wasn't a traitor
Nedić was somewhat respected and was part of chief of staff, while Ljotić was nobody
Even Germans didn't want to do anything with him, and he was a Nazi in Serbia
He was a special kind of piece of shit, collaborator and murderer, but he cannot be traitor, because he had nothing to betray in the first place
How do people see the current government
Most people (not all) still love and listen to ex-Yu music and movies made at the time the country existed
Love for burek, too (though there are some disagreements about its classification and subtypes)
\- Governments whose core base of voters are fanatic pensioners who rise in 7 AM to vote while healthy young people sleep until noon, wake up and see that it's a bit rainy today, and decide not to vote
\- Beautiful (but very demanding) girls all around, though they're distinct from each other depending on a country and regions within countries
\- Extremely prominent macho culture (except maybe in Slovenia)
\- Fanatical love of sports and obsession with betting shops (this is actually almost epidemic-level among men, starting at ages 12-13)
\- We're freaking tall
Very tall
edit: and of course, very similar cuisine and love of rakija
edit2: As the guy from Slovenia said in the comment, they don't fit into most of those descriptions and i agree
Honestly i find them much more similar to Western Slavic nations than to other ex-Yugos
We all really don't like Turks and we all have Inferiority and Superiority complex those are negative ones, although i don't think they apply to Slovenia that much
Besides Slovenes and North Macedonains we speak the same language
We all hate each other, but once we live in *insert western country* we become best buddies
We all like to smoke, drink, bet on sports
Semi-prominent football hooligan & ultra culture, especially Belgrade & Zagreb
We are actually pretty similar if you leave religion and politics out of the mix, but no one really wants to admit that
We all like turbofolk music
We all like fast cars
We all really like that 'badass' culture, guns, weapons, etc
Ajvar on everything
Add suspicious privatisation involved high ranking politicians, diplomats and people in the army to that
I'm in this comment and I don't like it
Love, too
Not everyone's consumed by negativity
No, ajvar is from southern Serbia and northern North Macedonia
I am speaking for Serbia here and I'd say the quality of Serbian music is much, much trashier than in other countries atm
Milomir Maric admitted himself that he pushed for Karleusa's career on BK TV in the nineties so Ceca wouldn't dominate the market (Ceca being Arkan's - Maric's archnemesis - wife)
He also got the green light from Karic who owned the network and made Maric "the cultural editor/director" of it
So, while Ceca ruled on Pink, Karleusa ruled on BK and they both set the standards of what's popular and profitable
It all went downhill from there
There are various interviews where he states this, the most informative one being an episode of Cirilica with Vanja Bulic, where Maric straight out told him (Bulic) he ruined the cultural standards by allowing turbo folk to be played on national television, after which Bulic hurriedly left the studio
Another one, much more serious was an Al Jazeera special where he explains that quizzes like Who Wants to Become a Millionaire were introduced to stupify people (along with turbo folk), and how those quizzes led to reality TV shows as they are now
I highly recommend watching it
Damn, that does sound amazing
Hopefully someone picks it over here
Damn those were two quality burns on Montenegrins and Bosnians lmao
Diggi kom mal Tipico
But on a real note, those shops make it so attractive to spend your money there
Its easy to get roped in, because it seems fun and harmless at first
Yeah at every point i thought ''wait i'm not sure that Slovenians fit in''. Generally you're too different to be put together with us, but all of these things are very common for Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Croatia
They're not new countries at all
All of them are very very old
They just unified at some point and then broke off
In the last couple of years bakeries becomes desperate, so we have now burek with kulen, burek with eurokrem, burek with apples and cinamon
It went to far
yes with sour cabbage but its not the best dish
Some people like it but most not really
Zeljanica isn't with spinach its with "zelje" (idk the english name) which is nicer and milder than spinach
Also often cheese goes along with it
You should dip it in pasta sauce
I honestly never met a Croat/Bosniak who had a bad opinion on me because I'm a Serb and vice versa
The hate is just political and the people don't hate each other
I agree
No, we’re not in Siberia
No, it's Yugoslav period chocolate and milk spread
It was famous for long time as second only to kinder lada spread
Nowdays they lost licence of production to yaffa, and now eurokrem is just black and white misery
Jaffa cream is where is at
But the name still standing
its this
it grows everywhere here and its got a reaaally nice taste
Yeah, good luck explaining it to my grandma
I don't know, really
I don't think it has anything to do with EU
When it was produced for the first time EU was Europe economic union or something
The licence was bought from Italian Gandola, if I'm not mistaking
I think I remember that one, too
But I liked kinder lada the most
I don't drink a lot and I get drunk easily
I hate most Serbian music played at parties weddings and other festivities
I think it's the trumpet which I hate the sound of
Like you I'm below average height, around 179cm and it's 182-183cm standard here
I don't wanna squeeze out ten babies in a bankrupt, destitute country to improve goddamn natality rates
I'm an atheist and I'm not a nationalist, I guess
Also our cuisine isn't great
But those *Serbians* on the other hand
Im guessing the appeal of Trumpet music went over your head :/
It really do be like that sometime
You can't that's the problem, I'll get you a stoole to stand on tho
In here porns are referred as Swedish action movies
"Why are you pretending to be English
" when someone is trying to be pretentious or something they are not
“Glup si kao turcin” wich means you are dumb as a turk
I heard an awful one (but it's also a great explainer):
[insert country name] are bigger [insert country name 2] than [insert country name 3]
I wont type it out so I don't offend anybody, but the way I hear it is usually us and some of our neighbours
So this is the balkans in a nutshell :)
I can't be 100% sure, but one of the urban legends I heard was that during the '70 first pornographic movies and magazines from west started appearing in ex YU
Mostly smuggled in by our expatriates from Germany and Scandinavian countries
There was black market for them where people would be selling them on the streets referring them as Swedish action movies
> My own parents used to let me sleep outside all the time in winter, even in -25C. Now I seldom get sick and am rather resistant to cold (-15c to -20c is still t-shirt weather to me)
this sounds like pseudoscience
We sing happy birthday in a completely different tune than anyone else
In English, German, French, etc
the words are changed but the tune itself is the same
In Serbian it's completely different, which I always found weird
Same here
Tito
Looks like they are getting worser with each generation
here you're called Rusini I think
Attacking Bulgaria for no right reason in 1885
In hindsight, Yugoslavia
Well, OP wrote "No modern politics please, it might turn ugly
And those recent things from 90s might still be  "modern politics", so i avoided them
Yeah, but that's not what Serbia did, that's what one Bosnian Serb did
Comparing Yugoslavia to Austro-Hungary is dumb
I don't think that's the dumbest, World War 1 would've happened eventually no matter if Gavrilo Princip killed Franz Ferdinand or not
And also Serbia as a country might have been connected, but it's not a thing our country did, but one man and his organization
1 being "multi ethnic" of peoples speaking pretty much the same language in a continuum
The other being almost all of the same peoples + Hungarians + Romanians + Germans + Slovaks + Czechs + Ukranians + Poles on top of it
I really don't see how do you think they're comparable
Actually, Montenegrins were pretty fine with that
Montenegrin politicians and people were supportive
>and actually committed genocide
On who
>If you are asking who did yugoslavia commit genocide on as a serb (judging from your user flair) then there are problems
Yes i am, im asking for clarification
> But fair enough, didn't know much about the Montenegrin part, was just assuming they were full of it as well
They themselves bombed the shit out of Dubrovnik for example
Which European country has the most beautiful design of car plates
No you can't. In most countries you can make choose letters, numbers or combinations
But you have to pay a lot
Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia, Montenegro, Slovenia have town codes too
Yes we play that game too
But you don't have many vehicles compared to others
Nike
com and literally any other big brand site doesn’t ship to serbia that very very sad
Its all fun and shit until they bite your finger
You can write only in Cyrillic
>Functional country, functional public institutions, functional local politicians, fighting corruption, educated fellow countryman
Like this country it’s a real living daily large hunger games but with stupid people
I can relate
Relate
Serbia
What
I always felt that Croatia is great with geek culture
I grew up reading old SF magazines from Croatia (Sirius was probably best in Europe in that time), and Star Trek reruns on your national TV
That said, dnd and tabletop games are really popular in Serbia (or in big cities, I don't know about the rest), is it really not like that in Cro
How are the Amazon workers treated in your countries
Yes, we are using two writting systems and can write in both Latin and Cyrillic
So there's no way you can write Ukrainian with Latin alphabet
I just read somewhere that Serbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets
But the thing that confuses me is that I saw some Greeks and Russians writing in Latin
I suppose it can still be used to some extent
I assumed so, but the OP confused me because he said it was impossible
It is clearly possible to use, but the question is how functional it is
>That being said Serbians and Croatians are definitely the best in my experience at knowing both alphabets
Croatians don't use Cyrillic anymore (since they left Yugoslavia) but many of them however can understand it
That's right, it's the same language
I just said that Croatians no longer use Cyrillic, but however many of them can still understand it
Your father's name usually is your middle name, but rarely who uses it
It's extremely uncommon

I wear mostly sneakers and I can't wait to get back home and walk barefoot (or in slippers)
I'd be annoyed as fuck if I had to wear shoes indoors as well
I'm not against a federation, but I wonder why would anyone ever say that a Spaniard and a Finn are the same
What kind of idea is that
Integration does not mean that everybody is the same, at least that's not what I understad the word to mean
Isn't a federation a means of integrating different entities together
Wait wait did the betyárs have their kind of paprikash
I don't remember, maybe it was l mentioned in a side page or paragraph
We mention it, but don't go into details
• [Cathedral of Saint Sava] fourth largest Orthodox church in the world
• [Gračanica Monastery] a beautiful Byzantine influenced Monastery, sadly in danger
• [Beli Dvor] the White Palace, residency of the royal family, then Tito and now the former royal family
Pretty recognizable
• [Serbian Parliament] a nice traditional building, was featured in Half-Life 2
• [The Name of Mary Church] not impressive per say but it's my favourite church in my city and I'm always in awe of it
Basically most of it is religious buildings, but very old or very big religious buildings
Edit: After checking Saint Savas Cathedral is the fourth largest Orthodox Church so far, but it's still an important piece of architecture and one of the biggest churches
Sava's Church in Belgrade
Kalemegdan, probably
I like how you can just walk in there, see things that were around during the 2nd century, walk a bit further, then see Yugoslavian artillery from WW2
Wow TIL im Swedish
Sorry to ask but why
Is it due to culture or you're supposed to not say hi to your neighbors or
We're very social, I would say even a little bit too social sometimes
But evading neighbours is mind blowing
The plastic bags and the ice cream box full of sarma is a thing here too
Jesus fuck we Slavs
Is this like personal attack or something
German is for me i don't know what it is language just sounds badass
Mine is Russian
Ah well thanks for that but he's Croatian and to strangers it sounds the same, but i agree Serbo-Croatian can sound badass as well
when Lindemann sings, I suddenly start thinking German is the best language in the world hahaha
To be honest i never watched that show, should i?
As a Community fan im familiar with that feeling of "will they do next season or won't they"
Don't talk shit about Greece and Romania, also Croatia only we can do that
I really think people, especially in more Western countries, should leave Romania (especially it's Gastarbaiter communities) the fuck alone with this whole "They're thieves, scammers and beggars" stereotype
I mean, there's good and bad apples everywhere, in every shape, way or form, sure, but even jokingly branding an entire nation of people, just looking to work abroad and make their own lives easier something negative and looking down on them by sheer default of being is really pushing my buttons quite hard
&#x200B;
Also, the opinion that people from Albania are all somehow criminally affiliated backwards hillsmen
*Please, stop
Russia - Politics is debatable, but the whole 'anything which has any loose correlation to Russia is used for spying' got a little boring tbh
Greece - Their economy was problematic a few years back, but they're nice people, and have great food and even better holiday resorts
Romania - First off, Romanians aren't gypsies
A large majority of them are hard working and honest people
Iran - The US is the only one to be blamed for the shit they're currently going through, from Islamism to the near-war situations
When I was in Italy everyone I was with did the hand thing as a joke (not to Italians of course but between each other)
I GET IT ITS A FUNNY STEREOTYPE NOW STOP IT
i don't like it when people demean the Balkans
only the Balkans are allowed to do that
you got a loicence for that opinion
Oh and another country I wanted to mention was Ireland
You got fucked over by the British hard, and still aren't free to this day
But 'hur dur lucky charms', 'drunk irish people', 'IRA 'terrorism''
I've sent two requests for my language to be a paet of Duolingo's courses, and two applications for working on it
There is still no sign of Serbia language :/
What about alcohol then
Shouldnt that be a better contender
because pretty much everyone here drinks, so they're looking at their ass first
Alcohol is OBJECTIVELY more dangerous than cigarettes, but hey everyone here likes a sip of beer/wine so yeah
I'm not a smoker, for the record
Not to mention that having simple things banned results in criminal activity and all kinds of shit
Look at weed and the usa, simple stuff really
I want state control over everything, some kind of regulation
Oh, and some other state, not mine lol
I can't tell the difference between trash and the sidewalk
Shouldn't you argue that we should make a special tobacco shop, then
Baba Roga is an old ugly witch that was used to scare children who didn't behave
I think she's also popular among other South Slavs aswell
We also have Vampires in eastern Serbia
Lmao, we have a parody of this song in Serbian:
Btw, nobody likes this guy here
There were a lot of Spanish soap operas every single day on almost every channel
But nothing compares with one India show that they started playing in 2008 until 2016
Let's see
I hate stereotype that we are war endorsing genocidal maniacs
I find funny the stereotype that we are lazy heavy drinking womanizers
Hrvati ustaše, Srbi četnici, Bosanci glupi, Crnogorci lenji, Bugari izdajice, Albanci kozojebi, Slovenci bečki konjušari itd
We have a saying "puši kao Turčin" = "smoking like a Turkish".
Bulgarian backstabbers (Balkan wars, WW1)
Slovenes are Vienna horse grooms (always subjects to Austrians)
Izdajice means traitors
Milunka Savić - most military awarded woman in world i think that says enough
Stevan Sindjelić - vojvoda from first Serbian uprising a true madlad, when he saw he couldn't win the battle he blew himself up and killing 10 thousand Turks with him
King Peter I - he freed all Serbs from Turks won a war against Bulgaria won ww1 and created Yugoslavia
Many more as well just don't have time to name them all
> Dugovics Titusz
Titus Dugovic in our language, i know about him, he's theorized to maybe being Serbian in origin if he even existed
Without a doubt he is, i love stories of distinguished people in epic battles
Stane Dolanc
'A Balkan event without at least 3 dead people is considered a dull affair'
Great great grandfather fought in the first and second Balkan War and was a personal friend of the Montenegrin King and had plenty of awards
Also one great grandfather fought in WW1 for Austro-Hungary I believe, I think he was sent to the Italian front
I also have some relatives that were Chetniks/partisans in WW2
It could be said that there was some ground work for potentially doing that in mid 14th century
Our first emperor who ruled at that time conquered large part of ERE lands in the Balkans before he was proclaimed emperor, so when time of coronation came official title that he adopted was "Emperor and autocrat of Serbs and Romans". Not a claim to the Roman Empire per se, though not far from it
Nothing spectacular came from it though, next emperor (his son) was also the last
After his death empire was broken appart and digested piece by piece by the Ottomans
Once for a brief time
I don't know if it counts but the Serbian Empire fashioned itself the successor to the Eastern Roman Empire (while it still existed)
Emperor and autocrat of the Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians and Albanians, not Romans
I think he also had plans to conquer Constantinople and become the succesor of the Byzantine empire
Official title was changed from time to time, and different names were used by different people
What I was referring to was version in Greek at the time of his coronation: "Basileus and autokratōr of Serbia and of Romania". To be more precise it ment "of Roman lands" instead "of Romans".
Kinder Surprise Eggs
He was really popular in Serbia too, along with Modesty Blaze, Mandrake, Tin-Tin etc
Slučajno is a word in Serbian, but the meaning is more like accidental
Random would be nasumično/насумично/ nasumichno
It's really fascinating how similar in some aspects Slavic languages are, and yet diverge in others
Fucking taxis
This goes for Belgrade too
Also, there are people asking for money for medicine
It is medicine, I mean, everything that you wish could be medicine, but they want your money for psychodelic ones
We have universal healthcare prescription drugs that are usually affordable
There are some expensive ones, but nobody will beg on streets for it
Literally everything its trash
Szekely goulash from Hungary, made of pork and sauerkraut,  it's amazing
Similar, but with much less liquid
Not sure about flags that arent appreciated
But most people dont know about an old symbol of the serbian people, a boar with an arrow to its forehead
I personally like it a lot because its more unique than the byzantine inspired two head birdy boi we have now
Our very first flag was french flag rotated 90 degrees
Everyone preasured Serbia tu abolish it (along side one of the most liberal constitution for that time)
Maybe the Yugoslav one, but more contraversial than anything
For me and a lot of people it is communist yugoslav flag
You forgot the flag from the Government of National Salvation (also known as Nedić's Serbia)
It was the flag the collaborationists used during the 2
World War
There are different opinions about Milan Nedić, for some he is a hero because he helped a lot of Serbian refugees cross into Serbia to escape murder from the Independent State of Croatia, to some he is a traitor for working with the Germans
But the flag remains controversial and only gets proudly presented from Neo-Nazi, Ultranationalist, etc
groups
Wasnt his flag just a swastika
Nope, Serbian tricolor with the 'square' eagle
I ask them what thay want me to say and its pretty awkward
I've straight up recited the old socialist Yugoslavia anthem and other old socialist phrases, several tongue twisters, and even quoted Jules Verne in French just to screw with people
Здраво, како си? Means hello, how are you in Serbian
Zdravo
In literally means Healthy and Hello
So I'm wishing someone a good health every time I greet them
Three thousand three hundred thirty three

Lmao this same exact thing happened in my home as well
If I try fast then it's a no go but slowly I can
It's really similar to Croatian, and I'm good with that language
Umm
So, Albania/"Kosovo", only solution I see is a one country two systems type approach on Kosovo (like Hong Kong), or us re annexing Kosovo
Croatia for the Yugo wars and the Ustashe, no idea how we could solve this, although I know the first step would be Croatia recognising operation storm as a genocide as it was
Bosnia for Yugo wars, again don't know but the first step is retards over here stopping denying Srebernica
Turkey for Ottoman Empire, no idea why it still is a grievance now
Bulgaria for back stabbing in second Balkan war and WW1, again don't know why this is still an issue it was a long time ago
US for the bombings, no idea how it can be fixed but first step is persecuting Clinton and his helpers for the illegal use of depleted uranium
Montenegro, shitload of retards here (and there) think Montenegro should be part of Serbia, we could fix it by finally agreeing if we are seperate or not
PATHETIC
We have a grudge with every country in eastern Europe (except maybe Russia) and more
How the fuck have we been found it when we were under Byzantium and the Ottomans for 1000 years of the 1400 years we've been in the Balkans
["Čoveče ne ljuti se" \(Don't be angry, man\)]

That we smoke alot, i think that we are the country with the most smokers in Europe
We do have beautiful women
I don’t know if we have stereotypes
Are we you
We almost hate people who pay taxes, even ourselves, since we have a feeling that money is being used against us
Which is partly true
You might try herbal
Menta is perfect, I like it cold, camomile is also very nice
We have culture of herbal teas so we use tens of different herbs for tea, but those two are most usual
Winter savory and wild thyme are my favorites
We see it as negative, especially for social events, even public social events as concerts
If dinner at your friends place is at 8pm itvis not polite to be there before 8:30 9 even
It is seen as negative because of the anger  and stress it produces when not being precise on time
In business, not so much but it creates much less tension and problems than in Germany
If you are meeting with someone for the first time, it would be really advisable  to be right on time
If other person told you specifically to be on time, you should do it
Other than that 15-20 minutes is not even worth mentioning
Actually, it is even better to be 15 minutes late so you don't create pressure on others to be on time
North of Europe doesn't  have AC, we on south started having them 20 years ago
But central AC is rare, only newer bussines buildings have it, you can see window units everywhere

not pizza imo but I'd definitely try that
I think i've seen it at a pizzeria but I didn't know what it was
I think what people don't get is that, while the Nordic countries are *not* socialist, those systems they have today were *built* by socialists and by people who identified as socialists - [Olof Palme called himself a democratic socialist] and it was for a reason: the idea behind democratic socialism and traditional social democracy (that is, at least until the 1970s-1990s) was achieving socialism **gradually**, through piecemeal reforms, and that is still considered the vague ideal today (and I say vague because, all social democratic parties today still retain the goal of "achieving a socialist society" but they do not appear to *actually* be committed to it other than in words)
My point is that I think that's what Bernie and AOC see themselves as, and that's why they identify as democratic socialists
They are perfectly in line with the European social democratic tradition
European social democrats historically identified as socialists and the parties today still identify as democratic socialist in their party constitutions and talk about overcoming capitalism
But 1) that's set as a long term goal, meaning they don't focus on it; 2) their commitment to it appears to be vague
Besides that, there's also ideas like [ethical socialism] and [liberal socialism] that don't even necessitate introducing public ownership over the means of production
That appears to be what social democratic parties mean when they call themselves socialist today, too - that's what the "Socialists" in Party of European Socialists means, for instance
Rather than advocating Marxian socialism, they will advocate "taming capitalism", "introducing a mixed economy instead", "a society based on cooperation, social justice, altruism" and so on
TL;DR Socialism is a much more complicated concept than most think, social democrats historically identified as socialists and many of them, as well as their parties, still identify as socialists today, the reason being they advocate for instating socialism gradually through piecemeal reforms, or they have a different conception of socialism altogether
Couple of times Hollywood tried to portray us, they usually made us look and act basically like discount Russians
We are more like what a child of a Russian and an Italian would be like
Slavs in most stuff, yes, but also talkative, expressive, touchy and family/honor obsessed in general
Plus we're a country of generally nice weather
In every movie  we are either whores, or gangstas or war criminals, violent, poor, stupid

Somehow we are always the bad guys
Is it because you live in the Eiffel Tower
It's currently so fricking cold here I'm freezing
And like 3 days ago it was very hot
I don't get our climate
Our autumns and springs got totally fucked up in the past few years
Remember that most of october we had april-like temperatures this year
I learned when I was 6 or 7, and before that I was riding it with those extra 2 wheels
I don't think I've ever met a person who can't ride it
When I was like 4 or 5
My younger brother had already known how to ride bike, and I was so ashamed that I couldn't ride it and he could
So I took his bike and in an esplanade I started riding it like crazy and I thought to myself "HA, see, I can ride this thing
" But then, I had to stop the thing, and I didn't know how so I just fell over humiliating myself
Country checks out
A game where you are Grand Prince of Rascia Stefan Nemanja trying to unite divided Serbian states into one to fight against Byzantines, Bulgarians and Hungarians
Also Stephen the tall and Djuradj Brankovic they were pretty important to 15th century Balance history
Totally not
We call bulgarians gypsys and sometimes romanians,we call bosniaks turks,croats ustase and slovenians gay
Usually if they want to get really offensive, they call Croats, catholic Serbs, and bosnikas, Muslim Serbs
Those are the best for starting a brawl
I think every nation uses that for someone lol
So the town of Kecskemét is 'town of goats' in literal translation or something similar
Gypsys,but in Serbia a lot of people love bulgarians
yes
No shit Sherlock
Well, the question was not what are your neighbors but what you call them, my Alpine Serb cousin
Here it is taught quite a bit
Events that lead to the war and, blitzkrieg, operation barbarosa, pearl harbour and the pacific theatre(not a lot), some African battles, defeat of Italy, defeat of Germany( that's where it ends for us) and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
And we also learn as much about the war in our country
Essentially it picks up where we left of in the previous lessons (interwar Yugoslavia, Hitler's rise to power and Mussolini in Italy)
A lot of it is learning about the Holocaust and the genocide against Serbs in Croatia
Yugoslav civil war and the big battles like Stalingrad and the landing in Normandy
But the focus is as I said, the Holocaust
We learn about NDH and how thay commited genocide,and we learn that yugoslavia was also in civil war between ustase chetniks and partizans
Yea same for me,but we learned more about atrocities committed by nazis and ustase
i mean i learned
The part where we were an Empire
Granted they have plenty to be proud for but they're proud for all the wrong reasons
Battle of Kosovo 1389 its overly romanticised in our history
The [Serbian Empire] existed for 25 years during the 14th century during the late and failing Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty
Fell apart into many warring states shortly after
[Moravian Serbia] the strongest of the petty states that emerged from the Serbian Empire
Fought the [Battle of Kosovo] in 1389, there's a whole mythology centered around that - heroic sacrifice, betrayal, shielding the West against Islam etc
The [Serbian Despotate] that succeeded it is sometimes romanticised as a Renaissance state
This is stronger among more civic nationalist leaning people
After that we learn about the hajduks, which are Serbian brigands
They're heavily whitewashed and seen as freedom fighters, mostly because many of them did join the [First Serbian Uprising] in 1804
The leader of the uprising, Karađorđe, is mostly seen as a symbol of uncompromising rebellion, while Miloš Obrenović who secured the gains they made during the Second Serbian Uprising is seen as more cunning and diplomatic
Both are somewhat romanticised but by different types of nationalists
The 19th century and the Obrenović dynasty in general (as well as their allies such as Jovan Ristić) are more often romanticised by pro-Western liberal conservatives such as Latinka Perović, Dubravka Stojanović, Čeda Antić etc
Their opposition often personified in Nikola Pašić as well as the Karađorđević dynasty are more often romanticized by pro-Russian populists
Some call the period of their total domination in politics after suffrage was significantly expanded from 1903 to 1914 the Golden Age of Serbian Democracy
World War 1 is, contrary to Western European states, also seen as just and glorious
The Kingdom of Yugoslavia is sort of niche, but fascists like the Bogomoljački Pokret set up by Nikolaj Velimirović and the fascist Zbor party led by Dimitrije Ljotić during this period
King Aleksandar is liked by some conservatives but is rarely idealized in contemporary politics, I'd say
I think this is changing with films like Montevideo coming out and the current President Aleksandar Vučić trying to whitewash the fascist leaning Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović.
There's a niche of left wing populists that romanticise Leka Ranković and Krcun, two communist leaders who had Serbian nationalist leanings
Until recently, these same people would be the ones defending Slobodan Milošević, but I see fascists try to co-opt him more often than before
In Serbia Yugoslavia and Tito

Even though Serbian despotate is far more worthy of the praise, but it was tiny and nationalist need to overcompensate
That doesn't look so bad tbh
Duisburg really is depressing
Idk man, compared to all the cities around it, Duisburg does seem kinda bland and unkempt
Although its one redeeming factor (that I noticed at least) is a cool nerdy shop in front of the train station where I bought a Jango Fett action figure
Store clerk was pretty cool too
Someone picked my pocket for the equivalent of 5 cents one time
The only thing even remotely criminal that ever happened to me was that someone took my gloves at uni a few years ago when I forgot them on a lobby chair
my phone was stolen
Never had I been a target of a crime, but my parents were
Thieves stole their cauldron from rakija still
The police caught the guys, but the cauldron was smashed and sold as used copper for scrap metal
They bought another one so that factory of happyness could work uninterupted
I know the guy, and I will get my revenge sooner or later
This happened ten years ago, but that was a good cauldron
Hahahahahahahaha I knew chalga is inspired by our turbo folk but Sen Trope is a straight up copy
In Serbia ita 'отаџбина' (otadžbina) literally means home land
Every serbian youtuber is kid manipulating basterd,i only watch Ozbiljne teme
Not really, he has a British bias
Oh and he doesn't believe in climate change, that's when I stopped watching
Not just men, but women and children too
We also have this custom of three kisses for acquaintances and distant family members, but not with close family
It's usually performed when there is a host and guest role involved, such as family dinner, arrival of someone or birthdays, weddings and funerals
Three has a great symbolic meaning, like Holly trinity, third time's a charm, three wise men, probably even more in prechristian period, but two not so much
Plus, in Serbian culture, we use it to distinct ourselves from our catholic neighbors, because orthodox christians cross themselves with three fingers, not five, even though Serbian society isn't that much religious, like it used to be
I love both but cats are more laidback and lazy like me so I can just procrastinate the whole day with a partner
But the majority of people in Serbia definetly prefers dogs
Besides Serbian and it's sister languages (Croatian, Bosnian and montenigran), regional official are Hungarian, Slovak, Ruthenian and albanian, and on local level Romanian, Czech, German, Bulgarian, Romani
The most unknown language is Vlach language (romanian eith a lot of serbian influence)
There is Wallachian language spoken by people in Eastern Serbia and it's similar to Romanian
Wallachian people are usually Serbs with Romanian origin and they're using both serbian and romanian language
I'm serbian but I have to pick Athens
Not only for the balkans but possibly for the whole world
As I understood some time ago only one country is always considered as part of Balkan, whether just geographically l, politically or by mentality and it is Serbia
Everyone else has a way out
Sometimes I have a feeling that "Balkan" is jusy politically correct way to say "Serbia". Like "Balkan is bad and agressive and poor".
We use a card or cash, but there's a special trick
Most of the money doesn't go to the public transport company so all the money is pumped out of the system and everything is shit
I think we have discovered the best way of running things, legalised crime is the way to go
You people pay
Here it's free as long as they don't catch you
We say "ptičica" which means "little bird". Some use "sir" influenced by English "cheese".
The mosquitoes seem to be retreating slowly
finally
We had the worst June in the history of mosquitoes here, even far from rivers and in the city (because the month was a combination of very hot weather and weekly heavy rains)
It felt like living in a tropic country for some time

Very constructive visit by Macron
There might not be a war again in Kosovo
Novak Djoković won wimbledon
Glad to hear that, wish all best to Finns and Finland in future
What were the tweets about
He did, and he even sounded quite good
For me it's much more impressive than Putin only saying a couple of words in Serbian during his visit even though there were more people present and Serbian is somewhat similar to Russian
He did yes, and he did it surprisingly well, although he was reading a phonetic text, still huge of him to give such effort
Congrats to you as well, Halep did a good job :D
Wasn't talking about what he said, he signed some pretty important stuff, that can't be re-arranged in a week
In WW1 Serbia's losses were more than 25% of entire population
France is 10th in the world by plum production
Oh, pardon
My (Serbian) friend once stayed in German hospital and they used to bring him food, meat and whatnot, without bread which is off course the worst thing that can happen to a person
So when he asked for bread they  started adding it to absolutely every meal, even to pizza and pasta
Argue with the Balkan countries all night until we get tipsy then we're best friends and we start dancing
Now, listen here, everybody knows who makes the best burek and sweets in Balkans
Don't you try to wiggle your way out of it
You could keep your raki for yourself and enjoy in our glorious rakija as long as you want
Hey, it's our turn anyway
Others could have even number world wars, odd ones are ours
Well you did war with Bulgaria and Turkey :P
Hungary is a Balkan country
I meant that Albanians and Gorani people makes the best burek, icecream and sweets by far
Also, what did you say about rakija
FYI, only slivowitz is collored by oak barrels
There is no place like home
Welcome
Indeed but you asked 'did we ever had a problem' :D not if you currently have a problem
Even we are good with Bulgaria now and we had a milenium of wars lol
We make rakija with almost any fruit
Šljivovica means from plum, šljiva - plum
Other notable ones are made of apricot, william pear and quince
Some lesser known are made of special kind of peach, vineyard peach, apple, raspberries and there are even ones who tried to made it out of oranges and bananas
There is also widely spread grape rakija - lozovača and komovica, but I think that Serbian made grape rakija are subpar to those made in Montenegro
I think that [Stara sokolova] exports to the US, so you could check it out
No problem, really, glad I could help

We have political scandals every day and celebrities usually try really hard to put their scandals to newspapers so everyone can see
The biggest one currently is about Marijuana plantation that was under the protection of current government official
We have one about defense minister's dad selling weapons on black market or the one about president being tapped
Honestly there are lots of those around
There is one about famous singer cheating her footballer husband with another, younger footballer
Racy videos and pictures that she was sending to her lover were all around the gossip print and the internet
But we all believe she sent all of those to the press by herself
Her career and public image exploded after that
She is still with her husband and more famous than ever
Yeah
We usually like to say that we are a criminal clan masquerading as a country
The name "Magna Carta" is short for "Magna Carta Libertatum", which is in Latin and probably why your spell check corrected it to "Carter". The English translation would be "The Great Charter" or "The Great Charter of Liberties", which I've honestly never seen in use
>The last execution was in 1959 and the last death sentence was given in 1980
Are you refering to Slovenia only, or to the whole ex Yugoslavia
I shower 2 times weekly
Is this country related or person related
I personally shower at least once per day, but I can't know for a majority of people
Belgrade (1
7m) - the most diverse place, a lot of history, friendly people, great food, and according to Lonely Planet, the best nightlife in the world
I'm glad more and more people are discovering Belgrade and Serbia each year
Some people do have the superiority complex, unfortunately
Novi Sad (350k) - visually more pleasing than Belgrade, home to one of Europe's most famous festivals, Exit
Their stereotype/joke is that they are gay; they are the most left-wing and LGBT-friendly city in Serbia
Niš - a bit poorer than BG and NS, historically important for both Serbia and the Byzantine Empire
It's known as The Emperor's City, since a lot of Roman emperors were born here, the most famous of which being Constantine the Great
I commend your use of /s because I hate people who use it but I feel it was very much required here
France has a very strong wookie / crystals / aliens told me / alternative medicine movement
For the life of me I can't figure it out, but you'll find a bunch of people with these smart ideas
Including antivax, contrails etc
Yeah, Wilhelm = виљем (viljem)
We mostly use the same names but spell them differently
Exception is in older history where we serbizate some names
Per example - (Landless) John - Jovan (Bez Zemlje)
If it’s a name that has a Serbian version, in same situations we use ours
John - Jovan, Michael - Mihajlo, Mark - Marko, Elizabeth - Elizabeta etc
Vilhelm is also correct
That is just a phonetically adjusted foreign name, we use the same principle everywhere
Better examples here are: John Lackland - Jovan Bez Zemlje, Queen Elizabeth - Kraljica Elizabeta etc
Corrected
Well those have to be translated nonetheless
Those are basically foreign words that form a name
But yeah, it’s hella funny
Iran is so beautiful,historical buildings,nature and nice and friendly people
Just the Balkans in general
All of the Balkans
To this day, when talking to foreigners or anyone from the outside, after a while people get semi taken aback when you talk of your home favorably or show any sign of, well, *normality as a person
* I know it's nobody's fault, but, Jesus Christ, goes to prove just how much of an ingrained stigma still exists around this place
I once had someone amazed, for example, by how beautiful Croatia's seaside was
Like, what did you expect
A post-apocalyptic Walking Dead style warzone where people attack you with chainsaws, bats and bite your flesh off like zombies
It's gorgeous country
So is Bosnia
Serbia
Montenegro
Bulgaria
The whole package
Paris isn't as bad as I expected
It's just another metropolitan city
We are not as backward as everyone thinks
Which ones arent and which were
Same, the number of expats who decide to stay here is growing and they make more and more videos about why
Lots of them from US and Canada in particular
Solstafir are great, Fjara and Bitch in Black being my favorites
Amazing band, Szelvesz and Siraly are fucking nuts
Our current president
Tito
"(...)   he suffered from various delusions, such as believing that he was [made of glass] or denying that he had a wife and children
He would also attack servants and run until exhausted, wailing that he was threatened by his enemies
Putin
He turned russia from shit to one of the strongest countries
From the collapse of the ussr country went to shit and he somewhat rebuilt it
the rape and murder of Tijana Jurić, a 15 year old girl from Vojvodina in 2014
It got a lot of media coverage, and few years later, the national assembly passed the law that introduced the institution of life sentence in our country’s criminal law
There are of course dozen from the 90’s, one of the most famous is  the murder of the journalist Slavko Ćuruvija who got killled in 1999, but until 2019, no one was charged for the murder
Belgium waffles that got Britian into WW1
Netherlands stoners stealing land from the sea
Luxembourg tiny tax haven
Plural: хвала вам
Singular: хвала ти
We can have anyone as subject and anyone as indirect object
Hvala - thanks
Hvala ti/mu/vam/Vam/im - thank you/him/you (plural)/you (formal)
Zahvaljujem se, zahvaljuješ se, zahvaljuje se, zahvaljujemo se, zahvaljujete se, zahvaljuju se - I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they thank someone
We can also change it through tenses
You misunderstood the question
It's asking whether your language has a saying for you thanking someone, in the name of your group
Yes
In Serbo-Croatian, *hvala* can also mean *praise*, although it's a bit archaic
However, there are plenty of derivatives with that meaning that are common today, like *pohvaliti (to praise/commend)* or *vredno hvale (worthy of praise)*.
It can get confusing if you're not a native speaker:
*Pohvaliti* - *to commend*
*Zahvaliti* - *to say thanks*
rückwärts, as in backwards
Gastarbeiter
I often say ja as yes instead of da(yes in Serbian)
Deutschland	uber alles
Palatschinken is of Romanian origin
Same here
We use quite a bit of these aswell
Wait you don't say tomato as rajčica
Богомољка, which literally means "woman that prays to god"
Kosovo is independent
The most offensive thing u can say to a Serb in my opinion
Do I need to say anything
Honestly if I ever go to the Netherlands I'd mostly want to see Friesland and not just because I have friends there
Both really, could be argued that Slovenia is Balkan based on history and culture beside geographic position
I live in Vojvodina, north Serbia which is not part of the Balkan peninsula but it never offends me when people say we are
Because nearly all of Serbian history included Kosovo in it
And because we have many, many churches on Kosovo
Because Albanians were crushing our crosses on Kosovo, stolen it from us
It got under 100 recently
More countries are on our side not recognizing Kosovo
It doesn't mean we have beef with them, but it certainly doesn't improve our relations
To be honest Serbians know very little about the Netherlands and I'm sure the Dutch don't know much about us either
I'm more of the person who avoids capital cities
Capital cities to me are like huge commercials that promote stereotypes for the country, I feel I'd get a more authentic experience if I visited Leeuwarden for instance just like how I wish people would visit Novi Sad instead of Belgrade
Similar in Serbian 'slovenačko' for Slovenian and 'slovačko' for Slovak, very confusing
Albanians are all over Kosovo
That's why they want to be independent and form Great Albania
They are doing the same thing to Western Macedonia
Typically they were summarily executed
We killed all of them
I work at an ad agency
We get a shitload of samples from our clients, which mostly translates into as much chocolate as you can eat/as many cigs as you can blast/as much anger as you can take
The company itself provides the laptops, phones, drinks, and taxi cards to drive around free of charge
They also pay for an occasional conference or two, but that's pretty much it
There are also mandatory benefits, like health and pension plans, but those are state-governed, so they're nothing special
Not getting fired
The only Serbo-Croatian example I can think of for now is "uspravio". It's a verb meaning "to erect", but it's conjugated and specifically refers to a singular male being/thing in the past tense
It's not in the infinitive form (which would be "uspraviti") so you won't find it in a dictionary
Where's the "e"?
This was the closest I could do  I'd love it if you could provide a better example

Merde baguette
For Serbia, it has to be the Battle of Kosovo in 1389
The Ottoman Empire, although suffering heavy casualties and losing its Sultan in the battle, managed to defeat and conquer Serbia
The ensuing five horrible centuries under the Ottoman rule and the Kosovo Legend, the main Serbian nation-building myth, are probably the most important elements of the Serbian national identity
Today, more than 600 years later, the Battle of Kosovo still has a huge impact on political decisions and moral and religious attitudes in Serbia
For us it is a battle on Kosovo in 1389 against Ottoman Empire
Then the WWI and WWII of course
The battle of Kosovo was a stalemate, and I'd say the battle of Maritsa hit us harder
Still an important battle nonetheless
I had to look it up - we eat this all the time but made with milk and sugar
And we don't consider it a porridge
I had no idea, the world is a weird place :)
We eat a lot of bread
Being afraid of cold drafts, even when it's 40 degrees Celsius
Edit: Wait, English native speakers, is it draft or draught
Google tells me both are possible, I was taught draft is correct
English language and literature student asking
Voting for Vučić.
Can confirm
I fucking love bread
Eating something without it would feel like I haven't eaten at all
We do that also
And if you come to someones house we will feed you, and give you drinks till you burst
you can't explain it
Alcohol makes most people feel happier and more open to socializing, not really a mystery
I started reading this expecting it would refer to a teenage birthday party, then I got to the authority complains part and I wasn't sure anymore
Here in Serbia we actually call it 'luftirati', with the root German word Luft
Yeah, but it's not as disastrous as people say it is
Old ladies here think you can get meningitis, pneumonia, kidney cold (may or may not be a completely made-up condition) and so on
On the other hand, my cousin who lives in Sweden told me people there don't even blow dry their hair in winter and they just go out with wet hair after a swim or a bath, without freezing to death or having even a minor cold
Your flair confuses me
Are you an American of Serbian and Italian origin
Or an American who lived/lives in Serbia and/or Italy
Interesting
'Promaja' doesn't have its verb form here, only 'napraviti promaju' so I guess we just use 'luftirati' as a short version for that
Great
It's nice to be in touch with your roots
Greetings from Serbia
Greece, to be fair we did share a border until relatively recently historically speaking
Greece for sure
Curious as to why
Actually Kingdom of Serbia - Kingdom of Yugoslavia
Before that it was in the medieval times and while you may not think that East Rome is todays Greece the same people lived there
That is indeed very interesting, i had no idea it was that important to you, i mean it is to us (there was considerable hype around Zeman and his criticizing of the Kosovo debacle), so i just thought our media overblew it lol
And yeah, the recognition of Kosovo has tarnished many longstanding relations, but im curious why didn't Slovakia buckle but Czech Republic did
I also know that when Czech filmmakers went to Madeline Albrights media campaign and showed her some pictures, she called them disgusting Serbs lol
You sound like a really nice person
Just wanted to tell you
I love it i was everywhere:budva,herceg novi,tivat,ulcinj
Herceg Novi is my favorite
Been there skiing,i didn’t like it
I was visiting Skadar and it was amazing experience
Been somewhere with my family it was nice
I was in Trebinje for a wedding nice place
I like the people
Amazing country one of the most beautiful i been to
Szekely Land
There are a *lot* of stray dogs over here, there are 3 dogs next to a local school
Blue 100% people would either have only blue pencils or pencils with all the colors (red, black, green
Nobody is against black blue is just more common
Depends, some parties have places where parents can sit and chat other times they just drop off the kid
Usually it's told in advance I think
Free sandwich
Bread, margarine, sausage
Serbia is really centralised coutry, literally every institution is seated in Belgrade
Also, ~1
5 - 2 out of ~6
5 million people live there
Smart
Eagles fly young, or in Serbian, "Orlovi rano lete". It was a children's book, and it was not hard in a way that it's not understandable, but it was hard because of the subjects it touched
For me is "Na Drini ćuprija" ("The bridge on Drina")  by Ivo Andrić
Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot
Wtf is even happening there, I will never know
When I have red the book I came to conclusion that I should have probably use some psychotropic substance for better understanding
> niewiasta
Can this word be used to mean bride, like in Serbian nevesta
> białogłowa
Is this literally whitehead female
Gospodar is master here, someone who owns something, whole gost is guest too
That Germans were unpleasant and cold
I visited several places, and honestly, everywhere I went people were very polite and helpful
I had a great time, would love to go again
Paris isn't a complete shithole as some media I used to follow made it up to be
Icelandic
I really like it and would like to learn it
I’m not exactly sure on this but I think it’s closest to Old Norse along with Faroe
Definitely Swedish, it sounds almost like a song at times
"Prva" which means "First". That's the most watched one
Although the first and national TV channel is "RTS" (Radio Televizija Srbije - Radio Television of Serbia)
I thought that everyone learns Serbian,as we here learn English and German/French/Russian
Sike no one learns Serbian
SIKE I feel like god explaining Serbian to random Americans on discord
>Serbia wrapped around Macedonia and bordered Greece in the west
Soon
>hasn't even existed in my lifespan
It technically existed until 2003
It was named Yugoslavia until 2003 and Serbia and Montenegro from 2003 to 2006
No it certanly is not
Everyone just minds their own business, no one cares
It really is
I was there twice, I've never seen a person eating and walking, except occasional tourists (and even that was rare)
One of the reasons it's considered rude is because it might inconvenient other people
Well, be it food truck or street vendor or festival, there is usually some kind of designated place where you can sit or stand while eating
Or you can get (heated and surprisingly good) food in konbinis (supermarkets) and eat it there
I knew it was Bismarck before clicking the link lmao
Depends on what ya mean by Supreme court
If ya mean by a court that controls the legality of legal acts and if an act is in line with the constitution then yes we do have it called the Constituonal court
You go to that court when you used all of your regular legal remedies in a case and they ONLY check the legality and whether it doesnt offend the constitution
It has 15 judges who different organs of law recommend the candidates
5 are recommended by the Parlament, 5 the prez and 5 the supreme court of cassation (which I will go to in a sec)
In our law the Constitutional court is treated as something different and not a regular court, but a whole different entity hence ya can only go there when you used up all of yer legal remedies
If ya mean the highest court to try someone in a criminal, civil, familiar and so on then it's the " Supreme court of cassation". Weird name I know
It's the last court you can appeal to using legal remedies (the constitutional court before is a whole different entity here) here
It also has other jurisdictions, like it can decide what court has the right to a case (in an instance a man lives in town A but he dies I  town B the two courts there cant decide who has the right to start the hereditary process so they ask the supreme cassation court to decide for them)
It has a president who the parlament chooses but it does not recommend the candidates, that right belongs to a seperate entity called the high judicial council which also chooses the number of judges and the parlament just picks them to be the judges
The number of judges there varies and currently there are 45 high cassational judges and the president of it
The pres has a mandate of 5 years and CANNOT be re elected again
Hope this finds ya interesting
Roki Vulovic

Ah the late 2000s-very early 2010s nostalgia trip, here we go
Stereo Love came out in 2009 and it's nostalgic as fuck for me
Inna has been around even longer
I know this one in Serbo-Croatian hladna pička means cold pussy while in Czech-Slovak-Polish it means cold drink
yeah, but it also means punishing
which says a lot about our style in fucking i guess
So slavorum lied to me
Very popular
For example in veterinary ambulance i work in, there are 8 male workers including me
6 of us have beards
Well i don't know, but the two doctors that work are clean shaven
All of our technicians wear beards
Plus me and one more guy that work in online pet shop that is part of ourd let's call it company,wear it
I was like clean shaven up until like three weeks ago, but i decided to grow my beard back
Czech and Russian, i'm not sure why, they just sound so pleasing
i get an orgasm whenever i hear russian or french
German and Russian
I just like both languages
I love it when someone speaks one of those
German and Russian sound cool to me
a Pole said to me that he considers Gavrilo Prinicip a hero dont know how Germans and Austrians gonna feel about him tho
The only people that come to mind are exactly why we shouldn't answer this one
To be honest everyone was working against Hungary in the 1848 revolutions
Hajduci
We had them in Serbia too, we also had uskoci which were like hajduci but instead of going backt to a forest to hide from the Turks they would retreat to a neighbouring country and wait a little before striking again
In Serbia hajduci are very well known, I always thought it was our thing, but I guess everyone did it
Probably 626
It would suck and i would die but i wanna see if we lived on Balkan peninsula or we are Immigrants like other nations
And the EU didn't learn from that
You're still called racist if you dare to be critical
Only one
Even that was late to come here
Only one
Only one :(
We have 1 in whole Serbia
One so far in Belgrade
I hear they're building another one
I didn't even know there were any in Serbia
Is it in Belgrade
Yeah, there's even a bus that uses it as a turntable
Balkans, but then everyone disagrees if that's East or South europe
Balkans, the place where most of shit happenes
That and Southeast Europe
(although a very small minority would disagree, those would say we are Central Europe)
I'd say Montenegro is fairly Central African, maybe a little bit of Western African because you're tall
I think east of Germany is eastern Europe, but below the top of Italy is south europe so South east europe
Fair enough
Do you take off your shoes when you enter your home
It's the first thing I do when I enter my house
I saw on the internet and with my own eyes that some people never take off their shoes inside
What are they, savages
Yes, of course
Always
I didn't generalise people here, I was just wondering if people take off their shoes or not
Of course it varies, there isn't a single country where all people take them off or don't. I also had no idea this was asked here before
No, they don't take their shoes off
Same here, it's my first instinct whenever I walk through a front door, whether I enter my house or someone else's.
I'd say  [Pogledaj dom svoj andjele] though it's universal
All people from all countries in the world can/could find themselves in it at some point in their history, the relevance for Serbia is that it predicted what would happen in the next 30 years
The one that more people would probably agree with would be  [Tamo daleko]
Wow, Welsh is really a beautiful language i can see why you preserved it despite the circumstances
Wow, Welsh is really a beautiful language i can see why you preserved it despite the circumstances
First time hearing this and its really nice, guess Yugoslavs make hell of a good war music
When you hunt it, you eat it usually
I've never seen someone order rabbit meat in a restaurant
I'd say its pretty common to hunt rabbits and eat them here in Serbia
I think rabbit is common if you have a hunter in your family
I had everything on your list and it's completely normal as far as I know
But it's not common as in most people eat various meat all the time (except hunters), but then again nobody will think of it as anything out of the ordinary
I hope you understand what I mean :)
yeah, its not something you eat everyday, but if you say you ate rabbit no one will find it weird
Underrated reply
Serbia and Montenegro,Serbia and Bosnia
Serbia and Montenegro
Serbia and Montenegro
Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro and B&H are all very similar, same language, similar culture, rakija
And Serbia and Romania are as well surprisingly similar
Leave religion & politics out of the mix and Croatia fits as well
True dat
No, no
Takođe
I love Breton
I'm glad it's doing better
Once all this covid crap is over, I hope to visit Bretagne, it seems like such a lovely region
I can't say much in Breton besides Demat and Kenavo, but I'm slowly learning French
Oh boy, Surinamese is amazing, wish I could have it every day
Gastarbaiters working aborad in the West for a couple of months or so and coming back home and acting like they're Elon Musk all of a sudden just because they spent a season carrying boxes in some random German factory
Lol same here
As someone from Balkan this sounds really scary
I change almost all friends every 5-6 years and keep best few from every batch
It's possible to go have a beer/coffee with almost anyone without even knowing their name and became friends
And I consider myself introvert
We don't even count 15 minutes, it's considered being on time
Only not coming at all is considered a bit rude, but still acceptable
Same here, but it's not big issue for private gatherings since everyone  just counts it in, but is really big issue for public concerts since you might just stand and wait for more than two hours for concert to begin and after you will be late for transportation  home
Ughhh it's a similar situation in Serbia
If you are a guest, the host has to constantly cater to you and watch over you when you eat, to either ask you if everything's good or if you need any more food or drink
It's annoying, just sit down and let's talk, the food is fine
If someonr invites me to come over at 8pm they get unpleasantly surprised if I come before 8:30 and are like "dude
wtf
King Dragutin first got Belgrade as a gift from Austro-Hungarians in 13th century and then it was capital for the first time during the rule of Stefan Lazarević in 15th century, mostly cause relations with Austro-Hungarians were good and Ottomans were a threat on the south so capital had to be as far away as possible
Sorry, my mistake, I didn't translate it well but I was thinking of kingdom of Hungary
Boli me kurac - my dick hurts
Puca mi kurac - my dick is popping (can also be used like this: *snapping fingers* "do you hear that
" "Oh it's my dick
It's popping")
Vrište mi jaja - my balls are screaming
Boli me uvo - my ear hurts
Might I add:
• Zvižde mi jaja - My balls are whistling
• Boli me uvo - My ear hurts
• Puca mi kurac - My dick is exploding(firing, crackling)
Serbia is number one world producer/exporter of raspberries
Vampire is a Serbian word used worldwide
i just read 10 minutes ago half of the raspberries in Sweden are from Serbia
Here you go mate
The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first appearance of the English word vampire (asvampyre) in English from 1734, in a travelogue titled Travels of Three English Gentlemenpublished in The Harleian Miscellany in 1745
[5]Vampires had already been discussed inFrench[6] and German literature
[7] After Austria gained control of northern Serbia andOltenia with the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, officials noted the local practice ofexhuming bodies and "killing vampires".[7]These reports, prepared between 1725 and 1732, received widespread publicity
[7] TheEnglish term was derived (possibly via Frenchvampyre) from the German Vampir, in turn derived in the early 18th century from theSerbian vampir (Serbian Cyrillic: вампир)

If you're referring to Syria I don't think the majority of people in Europe support a regime change
Other than that Catalonia has no right to secede under the  Spanish constitution, therefore going against the constitution is undemocratic
The legal and democratic way to do it is to change the constitution by vote
As for why a majority don't support Catalonia is because Spain is a member of NATO and an EU member and supporting secessionist movements there is counter productive
I was thinking more about the people rather than the governments
Of course NATO countries support the US against Assad
Also if they're against Islam then they're against Syria as a whole then it seems haha
>I am interested in Syrian war since it started and often discuss it on internet and i can say only few people really support Bashar
Really
Because I had the completely opposite experience and see few online who don't support Bashar
Ah well, that's no surprise then
Really no pattern
Its just differnet for most of the names
There are on rules for slavic languages
There is deminutive, yes, but it's usually derived from a nickname already
Othervise, no pattern
Well it doesn't have any rules
For example, Ceca is a nickname for Svetlana
Jan->Honza->Honzík->Honzíček
So it goes Jan-small Jan-even smaller Jan-the smallest Jan
I'm sorry, what
Noo
Macron my dude you are right I really hope our president in Serbia will finally expel all these migrants from our country
They are stealing, burning houses, beating people and everything else, while our president says that they are our friends
Islamists should stay in their countries
There is even a video of some Algerian dude thats saying how they should kill all french people while albanians should kill all Serbs and take our organs
So on a post about protecting peoples rights of expression and the right to believe whatever people want, you suggest banning people from believing in things you don't like
And what could possibly happen without borders, except the massive influx of various terrorist groups that can now roam around the world and cause chaos
to be fair, lightning is superior to micro usb

NSFW doesn't mean: don't do this in a workplace environment
It's a warning to not look at the content in a professional workplace environment because it is improper
In a plastic cup, it would be just better for everyone if there were no straws and not pasta straws because there is still some pollution from making pasta
I don't watch sports but this is seriously stupid
She's not
Tax football more
If they can afford to give such ludicrous salaries to individuals, they can be taxed more
dude, she's trying to imply the society treats them as if they are
every single footballer of the Spanish primary league has a minimum 129
000e yearly salary
That's ~10 000e/monthly
That's like 5
5 times more
Even those bench warmers who never get to see the field earn 5
5 times more than scientists who bust their asses of 8 hours a day or more to do work important for the humankind
You think that's ridiculous
Wait until you hear the salaries of the Spanish SECOND league minimum salary - 77
500e/yr or ~6500e monthly
5 times more
How shitty is the reality where scientists working to save lives earn 3
5 times more than someone who is a bench warmer for a Spanish club which is probably spectated by a thousand people when playing home
I wonder how deep we have to go into the leagues and how much of a shitty player you have to be to earn less than an educated scientist
How and when she get there
Bruh
I'm assuming she has stolen a long time ago and she hardly wants to get back to her sisters
It's not even a coping strategy I think people just don't care and never did
But they expect healthcare workers to die with their patients because it's "their job".
I woke up at 11 AM as an European and still don't understand what the fuck is going on
Can someone explain this to me please
It won't be a world war(hopefully)
Thanks
This picture is fascinating
Just imagine what's going through his head at that moment
In front of himself he sees a destroyed, completely decimated and weaker than ever Germany
I bet that what he was seeing was the last thing he thought he would see
Some people probably did something
what a shame
Never did i have a video load up faster
Got em
exactly the same happened in serbia during protest except media wrote "Monsters payed by america won't let ambulance pass".
There is also video of Serbian president who is 2m tall playing basketball with 11 years old kids and always blocking their shoots
He won
[Here is a pic]
I remember Kesić making fun of him for this
Theres also a video on pornhub of him fucking his citizens (not litteraly but metaphorically)
Yeah true
It's obviously a repost lmao this day comes every year
So not much sense at bashing it as a repost
Ahh I see, yeah people should look out if they are reposting when they post something
How dare you, Serbia has the best rakija(and kompletlepinja)

We do beat them in average height
I'm sorry but that looks more like six gorillion protestors
I gotta visit Moscow some day when I start earning money
Other cities in Europe on my list are Athens, Warsaw, London, Paris, Berlin
Yeah, I just remembered some pictures that I've seen of Krakow, the old part of town is beautiful
I know, but the IT sector is ok in Serbia
Oh, yes
I'm also interested in Dusseldorf and its modern architecture
As much as I know, Hamburg also has a really interesting port area and Frankfurt I don't know much of
Maybe it's different for Serbian citizens
I don't really know
People don't generally emigrate if they can stay, and I will try to stay
I like the word "lad". I wish it was used instead of "dude", "bro", "man" etc
You can’t call Serbs great bunch of lads and seperate our province on the map
You sir just lied
American view of Europe: Wait

Yeah, fuck the guy who forced the hystorical car producers to switch to electric, am I right
Yes he did, his cars were already selling in the US way more than in Europe back in 2017/2018
When he managed to build the new car factory in China everyone was like "oh, he wasn't just talking shit", right now the cars made by Tesla in China are all sold even before getting out of the production line
The old car manufacturers were working on prototypes and ideas for electric cars from years, but when Tesla was progressing so fast with the construction of the factory in China and with the numbers of Model 3s being sold in the US, the old manufacturers had to wake up fast, that is why in the last year and a half they pushed so hard for a wide range of electric cars to be available by the end of 2020 and 2021
Also because if they wouldn't have done that now, they would have never catched up with Tesla once their factory in Berlin is completed
I wouldn't say that Musk wants to save earth from global warming, yes some of his ideas and projects are good and will help the environment, but in the end he's there for money
Did you buy it from us (Serbia)
The same goes for Belgrade
Whenever a heavier rain falls, the city is flooded
Yea the gypsy guy is strait fire
Not as much as Messi in Barca tho
There is a far better version, that's actually really well thought out, as in it mimics the bs that the colonizers did in Afrika
No Vatican Lo-Fi girl
Shame

So if he married 4 gay couples, would that make him bisexual
It's something like marriage of nine people (4+4+1)
Thor ragnarok "Devil anus"
All I gotta say is bruh
It's 17 degrees in Belgrade currently, feels like april
Belgrade here, we had no snow this winter, for the first time in my lifetime I haven't seen snow in winter
Well at least we know how he has money to smoke regurarly
FATALITY
That law is fucked
Pretty sure he said that on average women are less intelligent but smarter/wiser than men
Although I do not know what sources he uses, I do not know how one measures how smart someone is, as far as I know only intelligence can be actually measured

If there is a correct position on Crimea there wouldn't have ever been a dispute
EDIT: And for your edit, why would /r/europe hate him for it
EDIT 2: This comment is stupid but I'm leaving it up cause deleting comments is for cowards
It's the same meaning with the words changed
I don't see your point
Yeah you're right
It's a really stupid comment I posted out of annoyance with semantics without a second thought put into it
I regret it now but deleting comments is for cowards
I'll try to put something useful
Oh but also when I said correct position I meant like politically
There is a correct position on a lot of things but politically it's harder to tell
Imagine being such a retard that as a Slavic person you emulate the people that wanted to exterminate your own ethnicity
Edit: To the users that are replying to my comment with "hold on, that may not be what it looks like", or "that is not a Nazi thing but a Roman salute". You are literally embarrassing your self and justifying a Nazi

Please stop writing
As always r/europe never disappoints to relate everything to Russia
CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR BROTHERS ️
Oj junaštva svijetlo zoro
Montenegro is free now,lets goooo
I see a lot of shit slinging going Serbian way
Anyway, I was born and spent most of my childhood in Montenegro
This is all personal anecdote but still having friends there and visiting often sentiment is still the same
You see my dad is a military man, that has defended Montenegro from NATO bombing
And how did the country pay him back
By blackmail in 2006
Any military had to vote for sepparation or they were served transfer papers to Serbia
You had no option to stay as you were seen as traitor
Some higher ups could but whatever
A lot of money was offered to vote for sepparation, which is not a conspiracy theory
Dad's friend basically just showed us an envelope full of money
That man is also the one who was a captain on a ship recently found to have been transporting drugs
Referendum day at first it was told Milo lost and I remember my whole school cheering, to have our dreams crushed later
A lot of friendships were forcefully broken up that day
On top of that anyone who happened to be traveling was not allowed to vote and was held up at the border, the same way they forbid Vlado Georgiev, probably most famous musician from Montenegro to enter the country during the vote yesterday
Now I am sure some people were for sepparation, how Montenegro has always had it's own government and Serbia has mostly been hands off
In a year since I left every beach I used to spend summers on in my small town has become Russian or Chinese property, or private property in general
You could no longer take your towel and just enjoy the summer and swim
Shit Milo is saying is ignoring history and making out Montenegro what it is not
Worst of all, all fears of Serbia are unwarranted
We do not want to unite with Montenegro
We already visit just by ID cards, no passports needed, nothing
Anyway f*k you Milo for destroying the country I loved, for ruining the friendships I made and trying to keep me away from my family there
Also the same goes for all your supporters and especially those who have sold their asses for 200 euros you gave them to vote for you yesterday and you still lost
Go rot in prison and hopefully great leader Vucic will follow you there soon
Yes this is amazing
You just got Serbed
There are numerous pro EU parties in the opposition coalition
Really
The party with an Albanian leader is pro-Russian
The pro-EU coalition is pro-Russian
There are definitely pro-Russians in ZBCG but to say that they are all pro Russian is just silly
He basically wanted to strip the biggest church in Montenegro of their property, and not any other religious institution - only the Serbian Church, which basically founded - and led Montenegro in it's inception, centuries ago
This is part of the reason ethnic issues are complicated in Montenegro
People have a very different understanding of what Montenegrin actually is
He tried to suppress a massive (like, historically biggest peaceful protests in MNE) by force, but he failed in many instances, since there were no 'sparks' on the protesters' side
PS the redditor who replied to you first repeated the same Djukanovic camp trope that this property in question was somehow taken from a non-existent Montenegrin church in 1918
It's just a fake history narrative, easily verifiable
Serbian church in Montenegro is like 400 years older than Montenegro itself
As it should be
And that 1918 narrative is a big shame to everyone who actually believes in that bunch of horseshit
Considering what kind of journalists serbia has some of them probably do deserve to be imprisoned for the lies they publish
So journalists don't do crime in rest of the Europe
I know what this map is trying to say, but I am 100% sure it's bullshit
Love the map 10/10
Just 5 in russia
Nice
Ps i like how Kosovo isn't a country here
Clear agenda pushing, isn't this against the rules
Nvm Crimea is Russia not Ukraine
For example like 1-2 years ago one of our newspapers published "trump supports kosovo being part of serbia" and when the white house heard about that bullshit they told them to take it down immediately
I sadly can't find that article anymore
But i do have [This]
Little Russia doing Russian things
Putin might be bad and everything, but Navalny is the most racist piece of shit that could be born
Dont be fooled by all of this
Only 2% of people support Navalny in Russia and that is not enough to make a change
vast majority of russian people like putin
Politically
Needs one more river to become Belgrade
Vikings, chaaarge
this is r/europe not r/unitedstates
As a human I am glad Trump lost but as a Serb now I will look at the US politics more closely now bc Biden has had a hate bonner on us before and I just do not know much on his stance or views on us today
I only know he views us as more stable then before and will work on the stabilization of Prishtina and Belgrade but how is the key
This will probably be better for citizens of the Unated States, as well as EU; but I am honestly scared for my country that is neither of those
Biden might have just been a "lesser evil" now for most of the people, but he is "evil" nonetheless
Kind of scared
In Serbia people hate Biden like the devil
Litteraly everyone hates him
Of course I am
I am from Serbia, and Biden is known for statements such as "all Serbs should be put in Nazi-style concentration camps" and "We should go to Belgrade in Japanese-German style of occupation". Should I feel at peace with his victory
Does most of Finlands population oppose joining NATO
He was the biggest proponent to bomb every Serbian city in the 90s. He said Serbs were dogs who deserved a German style occupation and he was working very hard to achieve that
You have both quotes in these two videos
There is a bevy of similar racist things he said about Serbia if you look for it online
Edit: some more clips:
Here's the occupation talk
Here's the one of him justifying Albania retribution and mass expulsion and terror of Serbs from Kosovo post 1999
Whatever makes you feel special kiddo
The first one is also from 90s as well, though not firmly proven
Allegedly, he states such thing in Senate
Even so, let's say it is not true or that even if it was true, that Biden changed his opinion
But it's hardly the case
His view of Serbs was obvious during his visit in Serbia a couple of years ago (can't precisely recall the year, it was after 2015 though) when he disrespected the flag of the country
It is a small detail, might look insignificant, but clearly shows his opinion of the country, which makes me 80% believe the first statement in my previous comment
Look, I came across those quotes multiple times on the internet over the past years, I didn't "invent" them
Some other guy posted the link to few videos connecting Biden with anti-Serbian sentiment
Jeez
They ended up bombing every city in Serbia btw
Here's the occupation talk
Here's the one of him justifying Albania retribution and mass expulsion and terror of Serbs from Kosovo post 1999
There is much more of similar things
And you might want to do some googling yourself, not expecting everything to be spoon fed to you
Dude
I didn't imply the direct connection between two, I just said that knowing that he doesn't respect Serbs, I wouldn't be surprised that nasty things could be said (out of fury, in spite, etc
) even though they are not literally meant
Was that sufficient to understand why Serbs hate Biden en masse, which was my initial point
Btw this is what Trump said at the time:
You're right
Now that I re-read it, it could sound like it
It wasn't my intention though, sorry
It's good that our whole country was bombed including hospitals, marketplaces, suburbs and even primary schools with inhumane cluster bombs
Yeah Biden should get the Nobel peace prize
Please explain to me me how bombing schools and hospitals in Serbian cities far away from Kosovo helped prevent whatever you're talking about
Could it have been done without massively bombing civilian targets
Netherlands
It's that dimension from Minecraft, am I right
I'm down, every fourth month we should let the animals roam free for it's duration
Good boys
I know of weirdos who unironically think that quarantines should continue after the pandemic because of this
They're violent thugs that are comprised mostly of commies and anarchists with a veeery broad definition of fascist
British isles always have almost no wildlife
Kosovo is Serbia
"flaunt sexuality"
*kissing in public, holding hands*
Wonder how often this happens but isn't reported
Plenty of companies have these bullshit quotas now
Covid like this
It's completely broken
Kinda makes sense
You want the Queen imposing absolute monarchy and ending Brexit
Because this is how you get the Queen imposing absolute monarchy and ending Brexit
that accent sounds so good oh my god
I am proud for you Bulgarians here in Serbia protest lasted few days only
How in the fuck are there so much protests
USA, Bulgaria, Belarus, Hong Kong etc
And when the yellow vests were in France we thought it was chaos
Sort of like the Arab Spring but it's 1st world countries
No you are not
Balkans had it all but unity (sea, islands, mines, mountains, planes, brain and talent)
It could be new Poland but instead, we are the worst :)
Actually, no Balkans is lets say "geographicly inferior" in contrary to the rest of Europe so even if we were the most anti-corruption people in the world, we wouldn't be on equal level of development with the richest countries
I am not saying that we should't try mostly for mental health issues that you can get from our politics but lets be honest will never be as the Netherlands,Germany,Denmark
I've never really realized how flat majority of Europe is
And I've lived almost my whole life here
Mindblown
Meanwhile in Croatia, a Croatian equivalent of Sieg Heil is on a plaque in Jasenovac concentration camp memorial site
Cant see this properly, im color blind
Would be amazing if these charts had % numbers on them
Biden probably got confused about the geography and nobody wanted to tell him
Bush didn't know in the first place
Eh, I admit it was pretty lazy
u/savevideo
Meanwhile here we have 3 times the price and half of that internet speed
I don't care who was in the right or in the wrong in that war
I don't care if they are our enemy
Nobody deserves this
War is awful
Well thats sucks
I guess she knows how stupid this war was
Why did they need Kosovo
They didn't, very simple
Some times I feel bad for the UCK soldiers, they went and died in Thousands, all for nothing
They didn't get anywhere
Sure they got Kosovo, but thats more because US & NATO Politics
Prijatno
That's the spirit
People in the Balkans wishing for another war have obviously never fought in one (nor did I)
This happened on both sides, it really is awful
I like you ppl from US
Too bad the bad and evil ppl run your goverment, and Im not talking about Tramp
CNN is feeding you fake news
You dont know better so you beleve them
You ppl can rise up, you have the power
And we are the ones who got illegally bombed by NATO with many innocent people dying and our economy being destroyed and a former part of our country breaking away
Also the Albanians in Kosovo were killing the Yugoslav police and millitary there which is why the war even started
Don't act like you are innocent and just a victim
I am not saying we were any better, but there were many innocent deaths on both sides and war itself is an awful thing which brings nothing good to humanity
You can hate me if you want to, but unlike you, I don't judge people based on their nationality and what their governments do
I cringe when ppl call them Kosovars
They are Albanians
If you really want to call them a differen name call them Šiprtars
Yea they died for their country
That is respectable and everything but still for nothing
They didn't make any progress
You are refering to us as if we made those decisions
It's like hating Germans "because they let Hitler be in charge".
I'm not gonna argue with you anymore, you can think whatever you want but the truth is that both sides were in the wrong, both sides suffefed many  civilian casulties and both were losers
We are taught in schools to hate each other and think the other side is the agressor, which is not true
Peace
Damn, only if there were less ignorant nationalists like you, the world would be a much better place
Top left, he's driving  SK-105 Kürassier

Hey, ive seen this one

We will stay like this for how much
6 m? 1 year
Should they have
I mean they didn't score twice as many goals for nothing

Ahem
PERKELEEEEE
I utterly respect Stalin; he was probably the most important historical figure of 20th Century and the man who transferred USSR from a poor and basically feudal country in 1910s to a nuclear superpower in 1950s.
That's an insane achievement only a few people who ever lived would be capable of !
I was sleeping here in Northern Serbia
I didnt feel anything thankfully
A jos nije ni April dosao
Can you recommend some
I know Idi i smotri, but that's about it
I also know of White Tiger, Stalingrad and the Sevastopol one, but all 3 of those are new and seem pretty meh
Edit: Thanks everyone who replied/replies
Too bad this doesn't exist in Serbia
And noone is held accountable nor has been brought to justice for it
The whole Union should be ashamed of itself
MH flights dont have any good luck
i like the award
I'm glad to hear it
Hope something comes out of it
Ok the Balkans are the best by far
Dude wtf even is a hydralisk
Build hydralisk
I didn't know my country is into Star craft (Serbia)
"Build a hydralisk" no comment on my country
"Stand up to my wife" its impossible my good neighbours
How DO I build a hydralisk
Spain bro calm down

Germans deserve it for complaining about winter tbh
It's just a joke i always watched stuff like pro7 and very often i heard people complain about the weather even if it was winter or summer
To be honest, I totally get that
The ratio of cars to parking spaces is 20 to 1 in my city
If somebody did this everyone would be pissed
This is getting out of control
France needs to stand up now, and be a leading example to western Europe
Stop with "peace and cosmopolitanism" bullshit already, it is selfdestructive
Love others, but don't let them take over and dictate their rules in your country
EUROPE, WAKE UP
Dear god now there is a 3rd
Hope our French brothers are doing okey and give justice to those savages,dont care if some see it as a racist thing or whatever murder and even beheading from what I read is an act of savagery
Legit this news is making us also afraid with our problem with some attacks from immigrants, myself included as I was one too almost
what was the third, besides this one and the teacher beaheding
Indeed, that's the biggest problem
Another problem are the classic western irreligious peeps, that simply don't care about protecting Christianity within France
What needs to be understood is that this time is not about Christianity itself, but rather about having a strong anti-force against Islamic threat
I myself am irreligious as well, but that wouldn't stop me to preserve what my country stood for in the past centuries
I hope the French will find a way to solve this in their adventage, and even though I was disappointed in France on many personal and political matters with my country, this time I fully support France in this fight
No more skyscrapers in europe
They look ugly
Europe should have buildings that are built according to the traditional architecture of every place
Can't you have a strong economy without the skyscrapers
This sounds very superficial
Germany has a very small number of skyscrapers considering the country's size, yet its economy is the best in europe and one of the best in the world

Meanwhile in Serbia after 50 years we still don't have  a metro :(
I thought all Russian metro stations had orthodox imagery
Pretty sure I've seen some stations with angels and stuff

Considering how much they want to destroy our race, they probably don't
Well, let’s see
If you get a 60 minute timeout, you can countinue without a ticket
If a cop pulls you over it may also take a lot of time to do all the work and write you a ticket
I think it is way better for people just to pull over and wait their time
To be honest its not so bad guys
Sure its kainda wird but its interesting
There's nothing wrong with the way they used commas
It reads a bit stuttery, but it's completely correct
I got an idea since the whole fucking Balkans are protesting
We go to every country and pick all the protesters up
Once we have all of them, we just drive into each country, overthrow the dictator, then go do that to the next one
Lol
I know that would never work
Serb from Belgrade that went to the protests here, you're dead wrong
Half of the whole country supports the protests, having in mind that protests erupted in other cities as well
Lol
Closest it has ever been to that is the first Balkan war, but then it was nearly everyone vs Ottomans
Because of the Virus
We already have one planned to
#RETAKE CONSTANTINOPLE
for what they did to Hagia Sophia, so 11th after that
Ah, ok

That sweet sweet EU money will never be ours after all
If I was Vucic, I'd pay for tourism to Baltic republics and Finland, just so that everyone gets to their mind with who we are supposed to be in union with
Compare how more xenophobic the average person from the Baltics is compared to a Turk and you get your answer
And Vucic completelly removed Russian news services from Serbia yet the relations are still good
The feeling is mutual, I think that our government should bring more exposure of Serbs to the Baltic states, they would be avoiding EU like vampires avoid cross
It was already done with Slovakia, Czech R. and Finland, our government should now target Baltics
You need 5 seconds of reading posts from the Baltic users to realize why
No homo

Weak for smiling
As a Serbian boi, me too
I’m sick of all the stuff happening on Kosovo
I want all of the ethnicities on Kosovo to live in peace and the governments causing harm to go fuck themselves
This is so sad its funny
I remember this from Wingman CSGO
Lol EU sensibilities
I like to trashtalk commies to be honest but not everything is black and white, turns out they did atleast something right in my country
I live in an old "commieblock", and basically next to my block there is a whole block of new buildings being built currently
It may look better but trust me this brutalism style housings are made with so much more quality than those cheap-ass shit that they are building all over my country rn
When my family moved in this apartment we renovated it to modern standards but we literally had 0 problems witch if u ask me is pretty impressive considering this building is almost 70 years old
Commieblocks have their own drawbacks
I 100% agree with all of this, especially the location and the privacy part
This old block is filled with trees surrounding every building almost just like in the picture
The new block literally less than 50 meters away, and boom you can see what everyone does in their balconies without even trying to look up
It would be amazing if all these buildings get their facades and hallways renovated somedays
They may not necessarily be the exactly same construction and materials
Even during communism not everything was made to be the exactly the same quality, you still had cheaper buildings and more expensive ones
For example here there are several buildings that are really really bad, they are literally falling apart
But then again they are very different to rest of the buildings in the neighborhood, they are less than one third of the size, with different facades and roof designs, and hallways so narrow that one apartment's floor math is standing in top of the other apartment's one, since entrance doors are so close to eachother
It honestly all depends and I'm not an expert in the topic
How the fuck pig could be racist
I swear, people these days could be offendend by anything
If you are looking to be offended
I mean, it's not caricature of Asian men, but  could be associated with Hong Kong protest at best if you streach it, as far as I understood
And I'm no Brit, but even if it fully support HK protests, it's just political oppinion and snowflakes could melt and stew in their outrage, but cannot force it on others
Seems like Germans love going to other countries in large groups
Map is wrong, nationality that visited Serba the most in 2019 was Chinese (about 150,000 people)

It's complicated

Fuck em
Oh great
Now Vučić has another ally in Europe beside Orban
We're screwed
Ahh yes, I used to draw pictures like this in Art classes
The teacher had never found it amusing
I am guessing everyone knows each other in this place
Wtf Germans, firstly r/me_irl now Spain
what is that between bosnia and greece
There's an impostor
I am a Serb and I support this message
I mean the Balkans are pretty shit anyway, adding you guys can't really make anything worse than it already is
Welcome aboard, Balkans may be a shithole but they are out shithole
I personally think that the wisest thing to do would be to get all Serbs out of there and give Albania a offer, they take Kosovo, and we take a part of their territory that gives us access to the sea
That would be the wisest thing to do if it was like any other piece of land, however, Kosovo has a big importance to Serbian heritage and history, so the smartest thing would be to give them semi-autonomy, they have their own police force and stuff like that, but are our territory and answer to the president, and if need be (for example they start abusing it) we can move in our police
This would be hard to pull off, but if done right it would be the best solution until we come up with a better solution
We do, theres actually no clouds in the sky as I'm typing this
Why isn't Serbia in any of these
For once, Chechia and Slovakia are the honorary Balkans and not Portugal
Kosovo is Serbia

To serbia mainland ww1 was worse then ww2
>The fact there hasn’t been a major war since WW2 is done 100% to NATO
Uhhh, NATO started several wars since WW2, are you one of those people that still think US and NATO fight for "freedom and democracy" and not to plunder third world countries

Fuck this cunt fuck him fuck his lackeys fuck his government and fuck every single fuck that takes him seriously
It's fucked up that none of our media is showing these
Ppl there are just gping to get infected
Its kimdof ironic when you think aboit it
Thanks Neighbour
Aww, thanks bro : 3
Vucic is sending 40 assassins to your house
It was staged
N1 je prenosio na svu sreću
Yes because till yesterday our supreme leader was bragging how corona is no more in Serbia
Ah yes, the biggest problem eastern Europe has ever had is Covid, bruh if we continue like this we gonna become "North Korea the sequel️"
wait what im missing is, how can Vucic run in Srebrenica when it's in Bosnia
Barem nije mogo da njih zaustavi
So it's not a local election
Got me there
Not that i endorse that pussy mouth anywhere
No nut november on the first and on the second
Happy independence day, our basketball archenemies
And it's 1 day after Serbia's dan državnosti (don't know how to translate it, maybe country day
Just lol
That this is what gets attention
It says there's no results found
Second link works
Pale old communists everywhere
And how are they different than those liberals
If left is so good Brexit, Trump and Pen wouldn't be option
System isn't working, current gov created this situation and crisis in EU
Not Trump, not Putin, your liberal government
And Macron is same as current president
Liberals won't change until they realise they won't win
I am liberal but for them is better to loose now and to realize their mistakes and come out stronger than to put every problem under carpet until it becomes too big of a problem
No no they are all for democracy, people deciding etc
but when non liberal candidate wins, OMFG why did you vote, you are fascist and so on
I dont like her but I would vote for because I am sick of current EU, and Macron won't bring almost any change
Because belive it or not, we are still in Europe and EU effects us also
For example, that moron Merkel condemned Vucic (our PM soon to be president) which indirectly said she is fine with Vucic being dictator because he promised her God knows what
(Probably that we will take more refugees) and many other examples
Nope its not her time
Next elections or the one after might be since right now many French people will vote for Macron to avoid Brexit and Trump, but when they see Macron is same shit as current president and that nothing will change then they will reconsider right wing
Yeah, Balkan friends who are studying in Germany and Swiss, are reporting that it became much easier to spot our folk there since they are the ones parked on curbs, not wearing masks and not practicing distancing
They say it's much easier to avoid them now, by not starting conversations unless speaking perfect German/French with others
Yet we are still figuring out why are we in the ex-Yu/Balkans in the mess that we are
Go fucking figure
Mig 21s are sooo fucking cool
You're probably better off getting a grippen
The French tend to be tough to work with when it comes to supplying customers with parts and weapons, on the other hand the Swedish will literally implement any weapon you ask for onto the plane, and the plane seems much better suited for the needs of Croatia
No way
Do you have any links for that
Really
I've driven from Novi Sad to Budapest, and the difference is huge in Hungary's favor

Nice
Well they were the biggest, like everyone knows who Hitler was, or who Putin is
I don't get it

Its decided by the amount of news or something
she is fucking annoying
I'm really interested about that
Could you tell me or point me to some sources
(I can read some Polish
) Dzieki in advance
im not saying her agenda is annoying
im saying she personally and the way she approaches things is annoying
Dont worry Norway, our foreign minister only speaks one language, Serbian, and our minister of Defense has never served a day in the army
In our case it is because all the decisions are made by him
All the generals listen to him and he has some stupid ideas about how military should work
Not to mention all the wars we had
We are still weary when the idiot comes at the forefront and starts saying some unsettling shit
Holy fuck that’s hilarious
Yes but he would have gone thoruht the training
He'd have some semblance about how military works
I think that it should matter for the minister to know how his branch functions
Nah smoking relaxes you
And after you're addicted it both relaxes you and your addiction
Montenegro went from orange to light blue in the meanwhile
No one likes our government here anyway
> Legends say they got married in secret
They married in Netherlands, what is secret about it
The story is that she got married in Luxembourg during official visit
I don't know if that fact could be verified
> Serbia, the land in which the Prime Minister is a lesbian, doesn't even allow civil partnerships
which is in process of being changed this year
Ah yes, same-sex marriage, the only thing that matters when determining if country is civilised or not
And the biggest Neo-Nazi group in Serbia is led by an open Jew
No it does not
She is a puppet to the president and has no spine
They are politically anti-progressives which is ironically a progressive and liberal nihilist philosophy that believes the Westernism is inherently flawed and malignant for world influence and that it ultimately leads onto collapse
Now you finally realize why pro-Russian and Serbian nationalist media is pushing for ultra-autochauvinism and pro-Europeanism, it is intended to create fight or flight response
It is a joke by Vucic and Seselj
Both pretty much come from the school of anti-progressives
Btw
Seselj was openly advocate of gay rights even at the height of 90s. They had a lot of openly gay speakers at their rallies
Both Nazadnjaci and SRS belong to anti-colonialist parties, the difference being that Vucic side belongs to left-wing progressive while Seselj belongs to more right nationalist wing
But in essence there is a lot of similarities
Yeah, an economist applying for a job that has a lot to do with economy, just imagine
Why is he right-wing
Here where i am its around 30C and wind is blowing, so i guess we're lucky
I like it
We have [something similar] to the building in the op
The original house was from the 1920s, it fell into disrepair, there was a fire, and was finally torn down to the ground, and rebuilt as a replica, with the addition of that glass tower sticking out
I think it doesn't look bad, but can't compare to the original
This reminds me of an event that happened during the defense of Belgrade in WW1
When AH started bombing the city, they sent a letter stating that Serbs should surrender and meet them at the railway station, waving the white flag
When general Živković arrived at the station, he simply said "marš u pičku materinu" (go fuck yourself) and continued fighting
Why is no one mentioning whats happening in Montenegro right now
Basically whats happening in America with BLM but religion based
Serbian people protesting are getting pepper sprayed and stuff
I dont really have to much info about it so i wouldnt wanna write anything false
Yea look at the first thing i wrote
Leave it to borderline cult like fans of EU to compare Putin to Hitler
I step in parties with minks and fly links
Shorties hittin me with eyewinks as I buy drinks
Nice pollution you got there
Yea, thats why its pointless
Bruh this is Reddit
Kosovo is not a separate fucking country
Oh, just wait another 20-30 years
They will switch places
another thing that is funny is that like half of those points are like that because of african americans even if they're miniority
15-16 is perfect temperature for me
With a bit of a breeze too
I'm originally from Belgrade, it can get pretty damn hot there over the summer (high 30's and even 40+ at times)
I've been living in Ireland for years now, so that might be why I prefer chilly weather

Orwell rejected false equivalences between liberal democracies and the USSR, most notably via his book "Animal Farm" but also in other writings
If he was still alive he would understand the difference between closed-circuit television of a public space and (for example) the kind of surveillance that occurs in China
Lots of good ones [here] but this is my favorite
> In my opinion, nothing has contributed so much to the corruption of the original idea of socialism as the belief that Russia is a socialist country and that every act of its rulers must be excused, if not imitated
And so for the last ten years, I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement
Also, one of his most famous books (Animal Farm) is essentially one extended attack on the Soviet system of government
Welcome to Serbia, oh wait
This is also why the EU is helpful, because when half of Europe has the same or similar worker rights and tax rates, the companies don't have much choice
When your country is shitty and desperate for any outside investment, worker rights are the first to go and people gobble it up because they don't have a choice
This coming from the alliance that outlawed people making fun of it on the internet
Great Serbia>>>Yugoslavia
Time to kill someone
how is yugoslavia supposed to be an insult
Except many Serbians would be very happy with this Yugoslavia thing
We've always had a thing about too big to handle country
>Remove some of Serbia from Yugoslavia, but like, not all of it
as a Serb I can confirm this would piss us off
You forgot the reason for it
Its from Ottoman era when material sych as stone that made these structures permanent was forbidden from being used
Every village also had to build one instead one huge one for lot of surrounding area if they wanted a church
There were many but they're gone for variety of reasons as its wooden
Maybe but we still need to invest in some more content, this is practically in the middle of nowhere
Go brothers
Serbia's protests are getting shut down but I feel it and would love to support you guys
Corruption is making my blood boil at this point
Serbia stands with you
We know what it's like
I think former Belgrade mayor had some shady dealings connected to your government
Ahhhh man I hate playing S&D on this map
EU sucks at PR or what you would call propaganda
For example China buys 1 of ours factories for like around $55mil but people here see that and think positively about it, same for railways
Russia being big part in Military equipment so people see that being tested and think about Russia being big donor
So people are seeing material gains for country instead of Monetary and that's why you have this graph
zero fucks given as 99% of that cash is just stolen by our authoritarian regime - which the EU supports
EU is a buerocratic, inneficient, and hypocritical nightmare
I wish Yugoslavia was back
You are recognising a part of our country and you bombed us
The colonisers (EU) have to give money to their colony (Serbia)
It is not that simple, friendly connection of Serbia with China (and with African countries if that matters) is older than EU, and Serbia does get at least some international support from China
Serbians do have positive feelings about Chinese
That if one takes into acuount that aid is rarely "money you don't have to give back" but loans are often  counted as aid and that even those loans have strings attached
the only difference with China is that China is more transpatent about their expectations
Additionally, event if that is all free money it is not even close to amount Serbia lost and is losing on the actions of EU
Like amount of educated people that left
I guess not bombarding, not implementing sanctions and not demonizing whole nation also might help a bit
EU had 70% support in Serbia in early 2000's. But unlawful recognition of Kosovo and uninventive " carrot and stick " strategy as well as supporting the authoritarian regime for over 10 years is not yielding results
Talking sanity is forbiden here
You are supposed to be arrogant , smart guy , subscribed to /DE and not falling for propaganda
All the while reading shit that RFE prints
Idk really, last i remember theyre a small south kosovo province that wants seperation
Why is it shocking
On one side you have China whith which Serbia does have friendly connection since 70's if not even before that, on the other you have countries that bombarded them, implemented extremely harsh sanctions, and before that killed 20% of people in WW2 and 25% of people in WW1
I am noy talking about who is good or who is bad just that Serbians being scared of EU and Germany is not surprising
There is history that is repeating it self
Add to that "aid" mentioned in the graph is given with strings attached and for exact stuff EU thinks Serbia needs, and it usually ends up in corrupt official's pockets and EU knows this
It is not shocking at all
Damn, the way some of you people see Serbia and then say we are blinded by propaganda lmao
Maybe for you but for me its my home and i will never recognize it not even my kids not even my grand kids and so on
We are heart of Serbia and we will always be
Serbs will never give it away
This is exactly what is happening
And China gives less but not as money, as they know how to work with corrupt officials
And it is not possible EU is not aware of that, so the only question is why is EU corrupting Serbian officials
If only
>they do not recognize their war crimes
Young enough to tell you theyre taught to us as war crimes in schools, at least it was that way in my textbook
Give it a decade or two, it will certainly even out the deniers and the educated
worth every buck spent for the US
Ally
That would mean that there's some equality in your relations with USA, but there's not
Who ever denied that
I guess every geopolitical analyst in the world is fed by Russian and Chinese propaganda
Serbia didn't choose anything, same way as Germany did not
Are you implying that Serbia had a 1% of geopolitical importance for the US like Germany did and does
Hell no
US has interest in maintaining military influence in Kosovo, which as you can presume is complete opposite to Serbia's interests, both national and public
And EU ascension is tied to Kosovo independence too, so we have to play with Russia and China
You are intentionally being obtuse
Serbia in history never had close to a living standard that Germany did
> Good life was forced on Germany
There was no choice for Germany, I dont see how I could be more clear
From 1944 to 1990's, German destiny was in American and Soviet hands, and the outcome was not influenced one bit by German people
> Anyway, you choose to play with Russia and China because Kosovo independence(useless ideological battle)
It's neither ideological nor useless
Is Ukraine's fight for Crimea useless and ideological
I was born and raised in Kosovo, and had to leave everything that we had there ( except what could fit in  a  VW golf 2 ) and leave
> instead of joining the union that you know would improve your life quality and bring a lot of improvements
You do realize that Serbia is atleast 30 years away from fulfilling the requirements from joining the EU
Also we have no bargaining chips with EU either, why would they ever let us join
When I was younger, first there was " Just take down Milosevic and liberalize ", then it was " Just find and extradite Karadzic and Mladic ", then " we just want normalization between Kosovo and Serbia " and now  its " we want recongnition of Kosovo as independent country ". EU went from respecting UN 1244 resolution to " eh whatevs
> That clearly a decision based on cost-benefit analysis that serbian nation did
Yes it is
In history we ve been in far deeper shit and came out on top, we will do it again
> It literally is
You are never getting Kosovo back, that is just how it is
That is accepting the reality and trying to get something more from the situation instead of letting it drag you down
Imagine using a word never when discussing politics lol
You keep mentioning this " getting something " by never explaining it to me
What do we get
If Serbia recongnizes Kosovo tomorrow, what do we get
Do we get in EU
Do we get somehow richer, anything
Nope
We get absolutely nothing
So its best to wait, its been only bit more than 10 years, and they are shooting themselves in the foot more and more
> What kind of bargaining chip did Slovenia have
What kind of bargaining chip did Slovenia need
They got their independence from the West, they never had Russian influence in their country, EU did not require from Slovenia to trade its territory for membership
I dont think you realize how different the positions between former Yugoslavia countries were
> Serbia never normalized the Kosovo-Serbia
Serbia signed Brussels agreement and did everything required of her
We gave Kosovo electricity, withdraw all our institutions, gave them area code
All they had to do was create Community of Serbian opstinas and they did nothing, even put taxes on goods from Serbia and BiH
> But it also did not reform its institutions so it can join EU
And that is the main problem
Which I never disputed ( I said that we are realistically 30 years away from EU ) nor it was a part of our conversation
Yet another reason why we should cross the Kosovo bridge only when we get to it, not now
I think the lady said this in Belarussian: ,,We are independent from tutelage
of Red Moscow
Here masters". Also I suppose she first meant to say мы независимы (which means we are independent in Russian) but then corrected herself and switched to the Belarusian word for independent
How I know/assume all of this
I'm a native speaker of Serbian, speak some Russian and was exposed to some Ukrainian when I was on exchange there
Unfortunately this took place in Serbia during the anti-government demonstrations last summer (you can see the most famous incident [over here] This came as a schock to our society, because we haven't seen that kind of police brutality since demonstrations against Milošević in the '90s.
Ah, that makes sense
Thanks for claryfing
This is my first time hearing Belarusian
From these two sentences I assume Belarusian is lexically closer to Ukrainisn then it is to Russian
Is that really the case, though
Yet still our government has strong support from EU leadership and top officials
Interests beat ideals, unfortunately
and 5 days ago in 1999 nato bombarded Yugoslavia
A few days ago was actually the 22 year anniversary of NATO agression against Yugoslavia
The fact that this is downvoted only proves your point
Serbia, nor Yugoslavia was ever a part of that
Yeah, that's my point
There isn't anything left of Yugoslavia
Yeah ok, believe that shit
After that go tweet about China having contractions camps and North Korea forcing its citizens to eat dogs
usa bombared montenegro and serbia for money
Kosovo has many minerals that were going to make bigger countries a lot of money
They fabricated that serbians did war crimes on albanian people
While serbian people had 13 precent in kosovo and were constantly murdered churches were burned down
Video was fabricated of serbians killing albanians which a finland forensics said they were fake
They gave serbia a ultimatum soo bizare
It said nato would have 200k solders on teritories of serbia and montenegro
They aimed at schools, hospitals, buildings people lived in, any company that was a competitor to any us company, a lot of bridges
They killed a lot of civilians
US said that albanian people on kosovo were terorists year before agression on Serbia and Montenegro
They threw 15 tons of uranium on serbia and montenegro which was a un violation people are still dying from cancer and numbers are going up because of that
You trying to defend what us did to serbia and montenegro is unbelivable
You can just google what they bombared in serbia and montenegro
You can see that it was all targeted and did for money
Edit: If there are any errors in english or gramatical idc i typed this because i couldn't belive people belive that this wasn't an agression
It's just sad how much fucking propaganda is west under,and you don't even realize
And,worst of all, you think the truth is propaganda and there is no way to make you see the actual thruth
I mean I wouldn't be able to believe myself either if I was from USA
That's so fucking depressing
I guess no arguments for this one
You can only downvote I guess
It literally is you fucking idiot
Go to Serbia and try saying that stupid shit
Yeah, ethic clensing was done
By Albanians
I went on Kosovo actually
Idk if you know,but i live in the same country that Kosovo is part of
Not a 1st world country that has heard about Kosovo only out of propaganda fueled news sources
I still hope you people are just saying that Serbs were the bad guys just cus u hate us,but you should know the actual thruth
Just in general,i see how western culture makes fun of every conspiracy theory and opinion that differs from the dictated one
Now,most of the shit is pretty dumb BUT you need to stop believing everything they say
Just knowing that media has the power to make you believe something that is false should make you take everything with a pinch of salt
Yeah,actually Kosovo makes 100% of Kosovo,but it only makes about 10% of the Republic of Serbia

So Farage and his band of cool kids basically can either sit there and stfu or not show up

Not a hospital for sure
Someone just took a pic of the spoon and then someone posted it saying it's in a hospital for some internet fame
Also in the original article the picture is different than this one and you can see a PS4 controller in the back + a wifi router
Yeah, not a hospital
In any case, it's a very cool looking spoon
&#x200B;
Ömg
Dont worry, serbia has friendly ~~concentation camp~~ hospitals
It's a Belgrade hotel called Design Hotel Mr
President
Each room has a portrait or a ruler
I doubt the journalist would gotten that room in he hadn't specifically asked for it
[A hotel where you can sleep with Hitler]
Hitler room was 200$, and Tito suite 500$.
Just did, had it sorted by Top so it was somewhere way below
And I checked that twitter page
Definitely fake
A really cool spoon though
Tbh I wouldn't mind having a whole collection of their cutlery
It's a nice piece of history
True, but Japan is mostly doing whatever US wants them to do, so they do have influence but are using it mostly to mirror US interests, so it's not really noticable currently
Austria be like: Am I a joke to you
Why
Ah Ortodox brotherin
Ah the good old no data

Protests in Belarus
Financed and supported by the West just like the '90s protests in former Yugoslavia were
They want to create another "October 5th",to "liberate" Belarus, and "bring down the dictator", but this is 2020 and Russia on the other hand is a mighty giant now, compared to how it was in 1990's. The world isn't uni-polar anymore
Russians won't let Lukasenko go down that easily
Wait till you see Serbia
It says Serbia could’ve entered 134 before Covid per passportindex website
and the Serbian number is wrong because it took into account the covid travel bans during the pandemic in 2020 which were only temporary
You Poles really love to talk about the Soviets every time Hitler is mentioned
It's not
Communism doesn't discriminate on the basis of your skin color, or nationality
True, Poland was a Soviet satellite, but your country was ruled by your own people, as every republic was (except for the Russian one i suppose, which was ruled by a Georgian bandit who hated them, inflicting a world of suffering post-WW2)
You guys think you had it worst, but you didn't. I know you historically do not like Russia in general, but look at it objectively
There is no way you can compare the two
Stalin, Hitler, you can talk all you want
Hirohito is often left out by you guys who like to compare Stalin to Hitler

The better the life standard the earlier they leave home
No surprise at all
Well im 17 and looks like i got another 14 years .
I don't live with my mother, she lives with me
If you work for 300/400E, which a lot of people in Serbia do, it's very hard to live alone in an apartment where the rent would be minimum 200E.
Living with parents doesn't cost anything
Us too, brother
Nowadays they use the shitty materials and cheap out on everything
They don't make them like they used to
> What do you mean
Faking stuff like this
You couldn’t give us a break, didn’t you
No coast even in imaginary maps
What do you have against us
Why do people keep using this retarded map
Kosovo isn't a country
Other than that, pretty awesome job
Hah, you're right, both "triangles" are just one counter-clockwise rotation away from going back to the original places
We should become friends real quick
Croats are maybe safe, but it would be foolish not to expect Spanish Inquisition as an orthodox countries
I think that you’ve mixed us up with our Bosnian cousins
It happens all the time, don’t worry, we look alike, but their heads are larger
They, for some strange reason seems to have subpar beer, but not to worry
They have the best water, really pure and tasty
Rye could be grown in abundance and Humulus lupulus grow of it’s own without any special care, so with some knowledge, you’ll be good to go in a season
Well, first they would have to deal with Montenegro issue
Nobody wants to be spammed with “Montenegro is Belorussia” anymore
Can’t they just accept it already that Montenegro went their own way
Ouch, are things that bad in there
Someone different finally got elected in Banja Luka, I haven't heard of his policies and stance though
(Also, what does anti UN mean
Is it because they wanna be in Serbia or
So, Dodik the second
Ahhh, the western Balkans
(what about the sarajevo guy/gal
what are they about
If being born in a developed country is something you feel you should brag about, you must be a pretty miserable person
What are you going to say next
That Albanians are native to Kosovo

It is good to remember not only the muslim Bosnians who lost their lives, but also to know that there where many ethnic Serbian families that wanted nothing to do with the war that where killed anyways in the crossfire and retaliation
We need to move on from this
This cannot be forgotten ever, but this game of who did what to who, and when, needs to stop
That is the only way we can all heal
Im a Serb, and am friends with Bosnians and Croats, and love them all
We simply don't let past generations fucked-upness shape our future or our relationships
We are the same peoples divided by religions, and that's it, that is where the differences being and end
It is time we start moving, collectively, in a positive direction
Rant over
It's like a google search away
Wikipedia is fine
First thing fuck off, saying things like " Serbs support Mladic" is so not true and clear that you have never been here
Only people that maybe still see Mladic as a hero are very old uneducated people in rural Serbia
Far low % of Serbs to generalize on whole population
Second, like in every fucking war, stuff happens that 99% of country doesnt even know
People in Belgrade and rest of towns didnt play part and did not support it, hell high % didnt even know
Third every story has two sides and truth is somewhere in the middle
If I was a betting man, I would say it's safe to assume you have no idea what you're talking about outside of whatever bubble you live in
That being said, if you yourself are interested in moving a positive direction, your first comment to me should be so aggressive
If you look nation by their gov, then Americans, French and British people are sick people since their gov killed so many innocent people
I dont know single person that thinka what Mladic did was ok
And I know a lot of people
With 100% certanty I can tell you that we are ashamed, but like in every country you have uneducated or just sick people
Even Germany has prople that think Hitler was good
Thats why I never defended it, but why dont you talk about hard death statiatics about muslim raids from city defended by UN on serbian vilages around it that lasted for 3 years
lol so your response to me, which is doing that exactly what you are asking for is it to greet it with more hostility
Bruh, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all
Not a minority, just have the ability to handle the white knight-ness of this sub and then attempt to convey our collective and un-provoked opinions
I do acknowledge I am only speaking for myself, I also do believe I'm incredibly lucky being raised by parents who taught me to proud of what I am, and accept others around me
Why is Kosovo googling itself
Honestly kinda surprised for Kosovo there
Why lol
Thanks
I'm a pretty right-leaning person and honestly I disagree with most of what you said, but it's always interesting to see someone else's point of view
Have a good day
I don't like this, people these days are so easy in labeling people, a nazi there a libtard here, yeah sure a nazi these days is going to claim that he isn't a nazi but if you call everyone with whom you disagree a nazi than you are probably the nazi
If someone these days presents himself as antifaschist he is probably closer to antiantifaschist
fucking antifa are as bad as nazis themselves
> Anti-Antifa is usually used to describe activities the most extremist far-right groups in Germany are engaged in
For example the NSU or Blood and Honour type networks are/were involved there
Honestly, I never heard for this, and I genuinely didn't imagine an existence of neo-nazi groups that go out and kill people who bring information about them in Europe
In Serbia people who call themselves nazi or racist are mostly some hooligan firms who follow that skinhead culture there are not many of them and I don't see that there can be a lot of secrets about or secret plans around them they mostly seem as some hooligans who want to act most aggressively against mainstream, on other side I heard that Arayan brotherhood in the US does drug trade so I guess that there are some secrets there to be protected
But back to antiantifaschist in the Balkans there are a lot of nationalist who describe right wing politicians of other ethnic group or other country as fascist or nationalist why present themselves as antifaschist or antinationalist even though using the same rhetoric as them .
I said, calling everyone that disagrees with you a nazi makes you a nazi
Because nazis use labeling as a tool as well to disqualify people and their opinions and so do they he is a nazi his opinion doesn't count
Now of course if someone has an opinion about mass murdering certain ethnic groups or seeing some people as less human than yes he is a nazi
But the point is these terms 'nazi' and 'marxist' shouldn't be used so easily
Wow, an existence of entire underground group that aims to kill political opponents or foreigners this is something that I didn't expect for Germany
Kosovo is Serbia
Knowing what Hungarians think about all this LGBT things, I think this wont be good
Equilizing gay flag with state flag is disqusting !!!
For state flag people are died in wars
So dying for freedom is equal as lgbt rights
You have no idea what you talking about
nor the lgbt defenders
If i am homophobe just because i claim that state flag and lgbt flag can't and shouldn't be the same thing, then ok
But your opinion is irelevant anyway
Lies, this is the metro map of the SPQR
I hoped something like this would happen over here in Serbia when we had our protests
When things like this starts happening, that's when tiranny starts to fall
Yes , i bet they think that every european nation is as developed or more than Norway
Oh fuck off Slovenia and Romania, we should be best in the region
Lol
Yesterday Serbia, today Lithuania, tomorrow
Happy cake day
the deaths went down in the us, showing that it is not as deadly as we’ve heard

>Expulsion is the method which, so far as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting
There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble ... a clean sweep will be made
I am not alarmed by the prospect of the disentanglement of populations, nor even by these large transferences, which are more possible in modern conditions than they ever were before
Churchill about expulsion of million of Germans after WW2
Unlike Albanians, those Germans (and over 100 thousands of Serbs from Kosovo) never came back home
Churchill is still celebrated as a hero in the west
Not defending all actions of Serbia in the 90s, just pointing out the double standard
Nah, of some ustasa giving water to a Serb
Looks like a southern European to me
Some are darker than others
Albanians are right on the southern  Mediterranean coast
No no cmon now, we’re not Ustashe here

Montenegro doesn't have a highway
There isn't a single road with a limit of 130km/h

Last year i was in Sunny Beach me and my visited Nesebar, one younger waitress didn't knew what pivo/piva was, we forgot you guys call beer bira
Also it surprised me a bit, considering how much Russians we saw there and they call it pivo as well
Edit: two years ago, fuck i forgot it is 2021
They betrayed us

Although that's not something unexpected /s
How is Northern Ireland in the British islands ?

Unless you work for 300€ a month, then it's not
Edit: But hey, come visit us
You're always welcome
Honestly not that bad, if you create a nice bubble and don't let any politics in
That means deleting facebook, throwing out tv, not visiting any news sites and generally hanging out with people that don't talk about politics
Though it does get very polluted during winter which is something you cant ignore
Vučić is a modern day dictator, the only difference is that he is EUs puppy, so neither EU nor NATO care much because he is a loyal hoe
Why are you studying Serbian
Tito made civil war inevitable
Negative
Studying aviation
Oof, a tough question really
In this state, not a chance
Democracy is on a pretty low level
I wouldn't call it a dictatorship yet, but it's becoming one
Mentality-wise, more and more people every year support the EU, but it's still around 60-70%. However, if a condition to join the EU was to give up Kosovo without getting anything back, the support would drop to less than 5%. The whole situation, as it is the case with the Balkans, is quite complicated
So if our system changes, and we gain something from the Kosovo deal, I see Serbia in the EU in 20 years
It's a common joke here that when Serbia finally joins, the EU will dissolve
Yet his warm relations with EU/NATO preclude Serbian people from giving him a proper support, because he looks like a spineless puppy, as he is
Interesantno
Do you find the language difficult
Имаш ли проблем са ћирилицом?
Fuck that Yugoslavia
1) I honestly don't know, sorry
2) No one is going to bother you, unless you own a fancy cafe/splav (night clubs and restaurants on the river) in Belgrade
So no worries about that
3) Officially it's illegal, but it has the "blind eye" status
It's not illegal as in the middle-eastern countries, and it's not liberal as in Amsterdam
Basically like every other eastern European country
Although my best friend did go to court because he got caught with two grams
Honestly I wouldn't meddle with that kind of shit, but it's your choice
4) I've seen too many maps with Serbia having, what, a gun for every third person, which is idiotic
Gun laws here are notoriously strict; in order to buy a gun you have to pass numerous exams, fill all kinds of paperwork, the whole process lasts for about a year
Once you do get the gun, you have to pay ridiculous taxes just for owning it, which most people cannot afford
Most of the guns people own are from Yugoslav times, and it probably just sits on some attic
My grandpa owned a pretty valuable revolver, he sold it and bough a new car out of the money
Regarding violence
The dangerous times were during the 90s, so it's over now
I've seen most of Europe, and honestly Serbia is one of, if not the safest country I've ever experienced
In most of Europe, people don't go out after 10pm, here it's the complete opposite
And sure, there are some "dangerous" parts - I live in one of them, but that danger applies basically only to football hooligans and drug dealers
Normal people don't interfere with that kind of stuff
Hope I helped, see you in beautiful Serbia
Yup, no wonder there were a couple of protests unfortunately
Hopefully more to come when covid stuff ends
Just like people in Crimea, m8
Well done neighbours
Greetings from Serbia
Pikachu surprised face
Looks like a painting
It's beautiful :o
Patrolling the Croatian boarder almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
Disturbing lack of trees near the buildings
Weren't so defensive when they were bombing Belgrade
Terrorist*
Serbs also luve u
Yes, did my 15 year old uncle deserve them too
Or any of 2000 civilians that died in the bombing or from radiation
Umm
do you even know why Belgrade was bombed¿
Ah yes, the liberators of the working class brought a tank
Not only that, but they were also liberating the upper class of their property and/or lives
Truly beautiful people those communists
How are the Baltic states Central Europe
Yeah sorry but no way are the Baltic countries central European
Also Croatia is Southeast Europe
Fuck this pretentious German bullshit
Europe's eastern border is the Ural mountains and always has been
This map basically also says fuck Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia
Ah, of course
Because geography itself was inspired and incentivized by the glory and splendor of the magnificent USA
Explain, please
Yeah, let's believe the China numbers
Looks really nice
I was hoping to visit it this year, but oh well, 2021 might be better
Ataturk’s rolling in his grave so fast by now they can generate electricity
Doesn't Russia have their own version of reddit though
Lol serbia god 2 places on that list
Kosovo isnt a separate country
My condolences for Greece and France
Also, let’s not forget that as we wright this down, two countries wage war against Armenians in Caucuses, which is not so different than this one
Well now shit really hit the fan
The same people encouraging on persecution of Armenian civilians in Artsakh and elsewhere within their reach are those who called upon retribution on French people
Actually both
Erdogan is playing very aggressively on multiple fronts
Altho CE cartoons led some crazed lunatics to commit terror attacks, now they have supporter and encourager in a leader of one of the biggest and greatest muslim country
He’s doing it in selfish interest, to stay in power longer, by creating conflict and homogenizing Turkic national being
Because the economy is failing, he only can offer nationalistic and religious pride, by killing Kurds and Armenians, bullying Greece and Cyprus and playing tough with France
First, I’m not talking about Turks as killers, but about Erdogan’s regime
He launched military campaign in Syria where Turkish army mercilessly killed a bunch of Kurds and wouldn’t stop it until  Russia stepped in
In Artsakh, Azerbaijan launched undiscriminated military campaign against Armenian populous with open help of Turkey, I would say even alongside Turkey
In Europe and in Turkey, we are witnesses of increasing number of attack on Armenians
They might hate him, but he is giving them justification and encouragement with its statements, so it doesn’t really matter if they like him or not
Why would you think that anything that someone from the US establishment says holds any real value
They are responsible for millions of lives lost in the last two decades alone
They would say anything that is in their interest
We can see with our own eyes how the conflict in Armenia is unraveling and we could all red about Turkeys army in Syria, no need for you to interpret it for me
It's funny how all of the commenters are Bosnian
Owl mocked the Tit ,  Smh
Savage
I can understand people wanting to have at least 3 children due to graying of Europe but cmon 7 is too much
You should draw Kosovo separate from Serbia, that'll be enough to trigger Serbians
Also write ["Kosovo is Serbia"] for Kosovo
Tesla is Croat
Come home, my mountain Serb brother
Lindt is beautiful
I don't think any other chocolate brand comes close
I remember watching a documentary on rape in South Africa and I think the statistic was that roughly 50% of women are raped in their lifetime
croatian people didn't commit any war crimes in srpska krajina, srbe na vrbe
Yeah, it’s obviously a lie
The first Yugoslavia wasn't forced upon anyone
Slovenes, Croats and Serbs joined willingly and it was quite a pooular move back then
The communist  Yugoslavia was on the other hand forced on everyone including the Serbs
You had option to stay under Italians or Austrians, but I remember you begging Serbian army ( army that you all fought against and some did unspeakable war crimes during ww1) to come and " liberate" you from pesky Italians
Well I agree with you on that, but by the same principal the Serbs should have had the right to secede from Bosnia and Croatia
Frankly the borders of the republic were a superimposed communist creation, by what token were they used as legitimate
Where did you got that from
It's just time to put that stupid talks to rest that someone forced you to join Yugoslavia, or that there was an option for independent Croatia and Slovenia
There wasn't lol
How did it happen then
I'd like to hear Croatian story, especially since your president recently said that you were biggest anti fascists during WW2
Yeah, you know, except that you probably killed close to 1milion Serbs, Roma and Jews, had close to dozen concentration camps and were the only one to have ones for children
Didn't Serbian cavalry march in Split and Zagreb
What for was State of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes formed for
Yeah I get you
Don't even get me started on Milosevic, him and Tito were the worst rulers of Serbia in history imo and that's including the Ottoman sultans
I'm just saying in the beginning the Serbs who began separatist movements did have good justification for it, but the execution was horrible
They didn't even had to be peaceful, just not so hatful and violent to the non Serb civilians in the area
It is very high bar to be doing better than country who lost 25% population in ww1, close to 18% in WW2, country that was under international sanctions for years before getting bombed by NATO, had part of its territory occupied by it, and its unable to progress towards its EU path cause of Kosovo issue
Literally everybody should be doing better than us lol
It's clear that you have no clue what you are talking about, but I will bite
What genocidal lies
Mladić and Karadžić ( and many others) were arrested and are currently doing their time in Hague
ICJ ruled that Serbia didn't play a part in Srebrenica
No genocide happened, nor it was intended ed in Kosovo, also ruled by international courts
Its far more than US ever did in case of, for example, My Lai massacre, which should be ruled as genocide if Srebrenica was one
One guy served 3 and half years in house arrest
And you wanna talk about alternative history
It should be easy to present counter arguments against my claim then, mate
These things  are two clicks away from you
But I bet you couldn't point Serbia on map, so I knew you werent looking for constructive discussion
Have a good day, mate
Lets hear you then
Cmon, you have this " genocidal denier " Serb on silver plate in that case
Why are you running away from discussion then
Your 3 month stay in ex Yu countries clearly makes you more of an expert in international law than judges of ICC and ICTJ
What narrative, mate
Are you implying that what happened in Vukovar was genocide
Do you know even what constitutes a genocide
Why are you bringing Srebrenica up now
Did I deny genocide in Srebrenica
You were talking about Vukovar
You can't stop moving goal posts and avoiding discussion
What I m denying
I m literally supporting verdicts of international courts
You literally didnt defend a single stance of yours
Kosovo is Serbia
LOL koji kralj taj lik hahah
He went too deep
Freude
Yet
Is that Ed Miliband
There are aoooo many better photos of him
Case and point:
And the Queen consort was the Hungarian countess **Géraldine Margit Virginia Olga Mária Apponyi de Nagy-Appony** (6 August 1915, Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary – 22 October 2002, Tirana, Republic of Albania)
She was the mother of Leka Zogu I, Crown Prince of Albania (1939-2011)
This guy is clearly a mad lad, what a legend
Learning something new every day from these comments
Nice
Support Austrian people from Serbia, stay safe
Stay safe brüder, I have family in the area, this hurts my soul
I am really, really not sure if they are trying to put so much hatred onto themselves to get obliterated by a white, christian man, once again
I mean, to be clear: I'm not for retaliation in any shape or form, especially not to collective labeling of a group of any kind (national, religious etc
) but tell that to those folks that live near the immigration camps (or gathering sites of illegal immigrants), places where terrorists attack occur and similar
You really are doing your religious brethren a grave disservice by pissing off the historically  most violent bunch of people (not only Germans, but ex-colonial powers in general) that decided to live in peace, and give multiculturalism a chance
Do not
Wake . Them
But hell, it will happen
No way around it in couple of decades or even years (these things usually happen overnight)
Unless islamists infiltrate each and every pore of western societies
Or those societies make some kind of
Dunno
Religious radical auto-detect systems for which they
omfg
will have to invade everybody's privacy even more due to "on-time detection". Fuck
dude, Synagogue is a Jewish place of worship, not Muslim
What's there to retaliate against
Oh right, it happens
He frogoten his hat lol
We need to see the ISS next
This won't happen in Serbia anytime soon
I wish countries did something like this with Serbia and our dictator
There's a ton of proof of people being forced to vote for his party, even videos
One of the opposition leaders even got our courts to rule in his favor and concluded over 2700 (25%) voting places had major irregularities
What happens with that now
Absolutely nothing, because Serbia is a dictatorship right now
If the president says nothing happens, then that's exactly how it will be
Video proof of a nice lady from the ruling party helping people with poor eyesight:
Article about the court ruling in the oppositions favor, it's in Serbian but I guess Google translate will be enough to validate my claims:
Now after seeing this and realizing even with so much proof, nothing will happen, do you still think we don't have a dictator
This was just the stuff from the major elections
Don't even get me started on the immunity his people have (a son of his main propaganda guy literally killed a girl with his car and ran away and got a couple months of HOUSE ARREST), the corruption, fixed public tenders, the policies, the way he spends public money, the constant blatant lies, the non existent freedom of press (currently our only free tv network is N1, an affiliate of CNN they can't control)
It's becoming unbearable, you can expect to see more protests in Belgrade in near future hopefully
dIvErSity Is OuR sTrEnGtH
\> West abandons religion
\> brings in foreign masses out of a secular pluralist mandate
\> does nothing to integrate them because human rights lol
\> the religious immigrants assert their actual tangible moral authority
\> "Noooooo religion did this
And you people will keep missing the point until you're gone and forgotten
Inshallah I suppose
In the Balkans we don’t really say “Sranje” we say “Pička jebeti matenje” or something along those lines
Jebem li ti mamicu u pičku krvavu
What does it mean,in Serbia we use ,,sikter" it's like fuck off, it's of Turkish origin definitely
[For those who need proof of Serbian black people]
I would add my birth town Brus,  translated to Bra
saturday -> subota
little saturday -> subotica
little little saturday -> mala subotica
Mala Subotica
Urlati has same meaning in serbian
So he is the CHP candidate, if there is a second round with whom will the voters of other parties nationalist, kurdish allign with him or with Erdogan
they need to activate windows
Finally a map of Europe I actually wanted to see
I see that in the end the money did it's things
I bet many "donations" were deposited to those who voted yes
No, I wouldn’t say so
We have the highest amount of register gun per capita in Europe, with 39,1 guns per 100 people, while the US have 120
I would say we have even higher number of unregister weapons, since there is a tradition to keep your armament from wars, since every few decades someone decides its a good idea to wage a war or invade us
It’s cultural thing, really
Yet, we are at lover half of murder scale even tho you all consider us murderous bloodthirsty maniacs
So, it’s not about guns
Same thing is here for legally owned guns
You have to jump trough so much hoops to get the weapons legally
There is also background check and neighborhood query to get one
For carrying, it is even more complicated, and there is just a little window to use it in our judicial system
It has to be in defense of similar threat against your life, but basically, you’re going to prison if you kill somebody in self defense if the attacker didn’t shoot at you
On the other hand, having any kind of weapon is a cultural thing to never wait the invading army unarmed
I’ve heard of people having anti aircraft guns hidden somewhere on their property, just in case
Montenegro uses euros
That is the small rectangular shape next to serbia that is touching the sea
Fixed it
And i am not sure about croatia it uses something called "kuna" so it shouldnt be blue
Kill it with fire !!! i mean covid19
Poor Spain :(
What's up with Serbia
So many countryballs that are not countries whats up with that
Include Republic of Srpska ans Bavaria as you included kosovo
So we are basically mordor
Sounds about right
t. balkanite
but look at the mountains, perfect mordor square
Awesome picture
52% of those interested voted to leave, I don't see the fault of democracy here
Thank god we aren't in EU yet
Balkan holding it down
develop my infrastructure daddy
>Stalin actually had a mental breakdown for a few months after the invasion, he did not issue any orders which led to chaos at the front and only sped up the German advance
This is poorly corroborated and very likely a fabrication
University of Dark Arts
Serbian passport is pretty good, imo, considering everything
EU, Russia, China in one go, I'd say that's a rare combo + all other countries ofc
Od moda srbije do moda evrope
napredak
Is it Putin's or is it a palace of President of Russia
There's a difference​, you know, it's same as calling White house, Trump's.
Same thing was done in Serbia  how they are trying to sell the holy Kosovo for money and a place in the even more corrupt “EU”
We need to be together at these times and unite for a better future
There are so many criminals to clean out of the Balkans
Support to our neighbors from Serbia
Is this the place where Kirikou ran irl
The Balkans part I can understand bc most of us migrate to the region's there like Vienna or Gratz but can some explain the hillbilly part lol
I know a lad who is near the far western part of Austria and he doesn't act like one (aside from drinking beer like a maniac)
Looks really nice but I’m surprised this got more upvotes than your [post] about Golubac which, in my opinion, is superior to Maglič
Quite nice
I'm from village with barely any population and i only had 8  classmates in primary school thats how bad it is
In Serbian it's "mošnica"
Checking in
Favourite heroes by a long shot <3
Kosovo is black because its not a country
are u in my psych class
That's no moon
We are nice and polite
You might think otherwise since we had a lot of wars and things, but I feel like that's the only reason why we have such high number of guns, I feel like extremely safe walking around and the last thing on my mind is that someone is going to shoot me
but is less per capita than France
Feels bad about us colorblind persons
Sto odvoji KiM
Falklands
Very true, tomato>potato
You should do an AMA
Reminds me a lot of my dads vineyard in eastern Serbia which has a field of apple trees beside it
It looks exactly like this at this time of the year
Oh, and the plum trees too
Zemljak
:O Gde na istoku
Jedno selo kod Petrovca na Mlavi :D
Nice
BTW there's a little line in Serbia, I'm not sure if that's supposed to be there
You should fix it
can you tell me what is that between Serbia, Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro
You cut 1/4 of Serbia
Hope you will fix that while painting
You should really visit official UN website with list of countris and their borders
lol is this Putin too
How not to use paratroopers ft
Bernard Montgomery
Seems like you accidentally also drew kosovo
Well, the Serbian Eagle looks
different
Kosovo is not a country
You made mistake in this map
Kosovo is Serbia
I wish they had a holiday like that in Serbia
Some fords are very nice - for example Focus RS and mustang gt (if you are middle-aged guy with a small penis)
Well, I didn't know that
It is too good to be murican :D
Jokes aside, I had no idea that Ford has European division
Kosovo is Serbia
Help
Sorry, but how the fuck is Moscow on par with Morocco
Romania has 2 friends
First one are the Serbs and second one is the Black Sea
Happy birthday Romania
Happy birthday,  neighbour
Romania is Epic
This suits more for Americans
You're wrong mate Aleksandar Vučić himself had a meeting with the tectonic plates
ROMANIA HUNGRYYYYY
NOM NOM NOM
What do dragons eat anyway
I am surprised how high Serbia actually is to be honest
[UK about Serbia]
I doubt is only neutral towards Serbia
More like hostile
Why do they hate Vatican lol
Majority of heroine in Europe comes from Albanian extremists in Kosovo, it's unfortunate that people will hate the whole nation beocuse of things like that but that's just how it is
Oh thank you, I didn’t know
Ahahah thanks for this
Had a good laugh imagining this
God has left the chat
Good
Down with the EU, bring back the EEC
Thia is way you always show dead body to dog
Atleast that is what people do from my experience, so dog doesn't suffer and grief for so long
Oh, that is really heartbreaking
Austria just there chillin lol
Croats be like: Serbian, Bosnian, Montenegrin
In Serbia it is nessesary to learn serbian, english and/or french/german/russian (really depends on school and region where ur school is but learning russian now is rare, nevertheless, you learn 2 foreign languages guaranteed)
How can you ahow 1900's data with 2020 regional borders
The data was measured within the regional borders of 1900
Stupidly incorrect
god bless the European Union
we should federalise it and turn it into a real democracy before those undemocratic ways scare away even more countries
Serbia’s with you
Power to the people
Serbian should always be "sneg/снег" since it uses both scripts
well, karati means to fuck in Serbo-croatian and it comes to Slavic "karati" which meant to scold
From it, we also have "kara" which means dick
It's nice and all, but it doesn't look nearly this good in person
I would go full raming speed here
Good news i am above average, bad news- i live in Serbia
Wow, I though Czechia, Poland and Slovakia would be around 1200 euros
Interesting
As other people have said, we don't. And if we do it's usually somewhere in the neighborhood (speaking for the Balkans)
Another fun fact is that the average income you see here is way higher, so in Serbia it's actually somewhere around 300€. It's similar in other countries next to us, most people earn around a 100€ less than this
Yeah, same in Serbia, it's way less
Most people here earn around 300€... If you have more than 600€ a month you can basically do whatever you want
It really is, everywhere you go, the beaches, mountains, rivers
I always recommend AlmazanKitchen on YT to get a feel of the nature we have here
